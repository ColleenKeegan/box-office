Its 15 certificate doesnt cut it. Whats needed is a 35 cert and a warning Contains scenes likely to disturb audiences not yet in their thirties. Seriously watching a married couple having his n hers meltdowns might be enough to put you off the whole find-a-mate settle-down shebang for ever. This is a sort-of sequel to Knocked Up - the movie that earned Apatow his king of comedy reputation. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are nowhere to be seen. Instead we pick up with Pete (Paul Rudd) and his wife Debbie (Leslie Mann) in the week they both turn 40. To the outside world Pete Debbie and their daughters are living the dream (mansion-sized house personal trainers iPhones iPads iEverything). Trouble is Petes record label is close to bankruptcy (hes the guy who turned down Arcade Fire his assistant reminds him). Debbie is in denial putting the family on a wheat-free wi-fi-free diet. And theyre driving each other nuts. So this is 40 is it? Well for a tiny corner of super-rich Los Angeles maybe. Its Apatows most personal film yet with an autobiographical edge. Whats more Mann who plays Debbie is Apatows wife. Their daughters play Pete and Debbies two girls. So you can see why some might think Apatow has gone soft or smug. And you might agree who cares if Pete and Debbie have to move out of their very big house into a not-quite-so-big house? However irritating This Is 40 is at times theres a warmth that wins you over and an honesty about families. In one scene Pete yells at his wife and daughters Sometimes I wish just one of you had a dick. Apatow also gets in some digs at the new generations mid-life crisis toys. Pete is a middle-aged man in Lycra on a bicycle - like those guys who watched the Tour de France last year spent a grand on a bike and now think theyre Bradley Wiggins. Its worst crime is its length This Is 40 has no business running more than two hours. Its padded with plots and contrivances including unnecessary scenes with Pete and Debbies dads to explain their hang-ups (we get it parents fuck you up). As a producer (Anchorman Bridesmaids) Apatows MO is making funny funnier amping up the comedy. You wonder if he could have done with someone returning the favour. And the appearance of a new generation of comedy talent in supporting roles - Lena Dunham Chris ODowd (pictured) and Melissa McCarthy - is a gentle reminder that being king of anything in Hollywood isnt a job for life.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 21 2012 Save for later Saved Paul Rudd (third from right) and Leslie Mann (r.) star in This Is 40. Suzanne Hanover/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Video This is 40 trailer Monitor Movie Guide Judd Apatows ""This Is 40"" is only his fourth film as a writer-director but his comedy influence is so ubiquitous that it seems as if hes been around forever. His latest entry is his usual mixed bag but some of the goodies inside the bag are worth checking out. Paul Rudds Pete and Leslie Manns Debbie are both turning 40 - though she tells others shes 38 - and Apatow scrolls through a checklist of midlife crises. (Mann by the way is Apatows wife and he also co-stars his two daughters.)Everything gets chucked into the joke mill sex jobs and kids - their two daughters 8-year-old Charlotte (Iris Apatow) and tantrum-throwing 13-year-old Sadie (Maude Apatow). The performers are so likable that you stay with them even when as is often the case the material is hit-or-miss. Albert Brooks as Petes moocher father is best; Sadies upper-crust dad is well played John Lithgow. Having made this film as well as his debut ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" maybe Apatow can cool it about the age stuff until everybody hits 50? Grade B- (Rated R for sexual content crude humor pervasive language and some drug material.)

Dont let it fool you. (UNIVERSAL) Judd Apatow is not a disciplined artist. And thats a good thing. A more rigorously formal filmmaker would write and rewrite a script to within an inch of its life carefully preplan and storyboard every shot go through a few table reads with the actors -- and then make the movie hed planned to make all along. Apatow though often seems to be winging it. His scripts sometimes seem more like suggestions for actors who madly improvise. The camera tries to catch what it can while the editing strives desperately to make sense of it later. And its only then that the real movie emerges. There is a downside to that process too and it crops up in ""This Is 40"" in the same way it did in Apatows ""Funny People"" or ""Knocked Up"" or ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" The movie is too long. A major subplot is forgotten. Some of the editing is clunky. But the upside - real performances from a cast of constant collaborators wildly raunchy dialogue that has you red-faced with either embarrassment or laughter - more than makes up for it. Apatow tends to overstuff his films with supporting characters and two of the ones who showed up in ""Knocked Up"" - his most controlled comedy - were Pete and Debbie the sister and brother-in-law of Katherine Heigls character and one of her best arguments for why she never wanted to get married. Heigl doesnt return in ""This Is 40"" - not surprising considering she later dissed ""Knocked Up"" as sexist. But Pete and Debbie are back played again by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann. Theyre still fighting and still in love - but also older and thats complicating everything. She is in deep denial still holding on to the myth of 38 two years after the fact and terrified of becoming middle-aged. And he is mired in even deeper self-deception refusing to admit that debts are mounting and his indie-record-label is foundering. Stated as calmly and coldly as that it sounds like the synopsis for a bleak drama. In Apatows hands though it becomes something else - a comedy yes but also a slice of life. His characters are absurd obscene annoying - but also very real and very very raw. (Although while Apatow still cant resist a good or bad bathroom joke this may be the first of his farces not to go full-frontal.) It helps too that as usual the filmmaker uses old collaborators - Rudd Jason Segel Melissa McCarthy - hes worked with before. And that hes brought new people into the fold including John Lithgow (perfect as Manns uptight father) and Albert Brooks a stand-out as Rudds mooching dad. If an Apatow set feels like family thats because this film really is - Mann is Apatows wife and their two daughters Iris and Maude show up playing her kids. The littlest Apatows have been in some of dads other films mostly as window-dressing but they have bigger parts here and are really good; Iris the youngest is naturally funny. And Mann is particularly good as Debbie a woman so worried about how others see her she has no image of herself at all. Shes always been a deft comedian but this film allows her to show off her acting as well; for all its rudeness its the sweetest gift Apatow could have given her. Its not a particularly well-wrapped gift. There are some awkward moments and some of the gross-out gags and blue dialogue are adolescently self-indulgent. A major plot point - with the couple teetering on the edge of financial ruin - is simply forgotten and theres no sense that any of the characters truly change. But perhaps thats the point. We dont change. We just go on. For richer or poorer for better and for worse in sickness and in health. But mostly if were lucky in laughter.

Because no one could be as whiny spoiled tasteless combative and reliant on annoying stand-up comedy riffs as the entire cast of this film the most disappointing one of the year. In the opening minutes Apatows self-indulgence quickly slips into self-abuse and then into audience abuse. Paul Rudd plays Pete an Apatow-like figure who is turning 40 the same week as his wife Debbie (Apatows missus Mann -- Rudd and her kids are played by Apatow and Manns real kids). Pete and Debbie who are having sex in the shower get things going with a dual unfunny riff on his man-parts just minutes before a minor character delivers a similarly excruciating soliloquy on her numb vagina. Debbie refuses to concede shes 40 insisting her birthday cake be topped with the numerals ""38."" A woman who lies about her age? Hackneyed stuff even for a stand-up working the Sands in 1971 Las Vegas. Floundering for a conflict that rises above sitcom level Apatow finally settles on the impending financial disaster resulting from theft at Debbies clothing store and Petes failing record label (his big idea is to coax Apatows high school favorite Graham Parker to do a new record). Its a little hard to take the financial jabber seriously as the pair cruise around in their Lexus and BMW take a trip to a five-star hotel on the Pacific and host a catered party for dozens of people. But Apatow has been rich for a very long time and hes forgotten what it means not to be rich (much less broke). Moreover the characters themselves dont even seem to take their plight seriously At the end they decide to sell their house which looks like its worth seven figures with as much anguish as if theyre returning a shirt. Stretching an already-thin story -- like most Apatow movies this one could be called ""This Is 140"" as in minutes long -- the writer-director invites his pals to drop in and deliver prepackaged sets of mildly humorous observations the comics call ""bits."" Albert Brooks (who is starting to look like Jake LaMotta at the end of ""Raging Bull"") plays Petes dad who does gags on his young triplet boys being indistinguishable; Megan Fox plays the hottie at Debbies store who inspires horny talk from the men and does a bit on how she isnt really a hooker; Charlyne Yi plays a store clerk who bizarrely slips into stand-up comedy voice impressions. Oh and Apatows children keep fighting and screaming at each other which provides a little break from all the scenes in which Mann and Rudd scream and whine. The comic efforts both feel forced and undercut any attempt at drama If the characters are feeling chipper enough to make their troubles into Laff Factory routines we cant get worked up about them either. Petes business is endangered by his losing touch with contemporary music but that yields a trite ""bit"" about aging rockers with a record-label employee (Dunham). A Debbie-Pete fight dissolves into their comparing themselves to Simon and Garfunkel and after that with everyone sulking around the breakfast table one of the daughters wants to know why no ones talking. ""Its the Sounds of Silence "" says Pete. Get it? Its what stand-ups call ""a callback"" to a previous bit. Nonstop delivery of such ""material"" only works when all your characters are comics as they were in Apatows ""Funny People."" Even the casting doesnt make sense Debbie keeps yelling at Pete about his cupcake habit but Paul Rudd isnt fat. Meanwhile the lumpy Jason Segel plays . . . a hot fitness trainer? And Apatows patented ""outrageous"" potty humor is starting to be as funny as a glimpse within grandpas open hospital gown. There are scenes plural with Rudd on the john which Apatow seems to find automatically hilarious (it isnt) and another with Rudd using a mirror to peer fascinated up his own butt. Thats as good a metaphor as any for what Apatow is doing.

Starring Paul Rudd Leslie Mann Melissa McCarthy Director Judd Apatow Running time 213 Release Opened Dec 21 2012  Editorial Review Skilled cast predictable plotBy Michael OSullivanFriday December 21 2012As unstructured as a sweatsuit ""This Is 40"" nevertheless is a comfortable fit for its stars Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann who bring a laid-back chemistry and prickly energy to writer-director Judd Apatows amiably angsty comedy about a married couple facing midlife. Playing slightly older versions of their characters in Apatows 2007 ""Knocked Up"" Rudd and Mann bring considerable appeal to Pete and Debbie a loving if bickering husband and wife both of whom are on the cusp of 40. If only the film itself were half as charming. Overlong unnecessarily sex-obsessed and downright nasty at times ""This Is 40"" feels haphazard and unfinished despite a few moments of laugh-out-loud humor. Taking place during the run-up to Petes birthday party the movie is built as a largely plotless string of vignettes -- some funny some not some telling some trite. When it works as with a recurrent joke about Pete escaping from his wife and two daughters by retreating to the bathroom to play Scrabble on his iPad the film feels honest and the characters recognizably neurotic yet fresh. When it doesnt as with repeated references to Petes and Debbies struggles with his-and-hers addictions -- his to cupcakes hers to cigarettes -- ""This Is 40"" comes across like any other lazy marital yuk-fest. For the most part though ""This Is 40"" is a gag-free zone. The comedy such as it is comes from closely observed characters and not necessarily from situations or jokes. Its wry and incidental. One exception A hilarious scene in which Pete and Debbie are confronted -- with profanely violent threats -- by a woman (Melissa McCarthy) whose son has been harassing their eldest daughter on Facebook. Otherwise the movie is carried on the backs of its talented cast including Albert Brooks and John Lithgow as the grandfathers. Petes dad (Brooks) is a lovable moocher; Debbies (Lithgow) is a cold fish whom she has hardly seen since he divorced her mother when Debbie was a girl. Theyre smallish parts but well-written and as acted by Brooks and Lithgow fully fleshed. Equally watchable are Maude and Iris Apatow -- the director and Manns daughters -- as Pete and Debbies kids 13-year-old Sadie and her much younger sister Charlotte. Megan Fox also has a funny self-aware turn as a lusty (and possibly larcenous) saleswoman at Debbies dress shop. In a small role as an employee at Petes struggling record label Chris ODowd makes an impression but hes nowhere near as cute as he was in ""Bridesmaids."" The story chugs along on predictable fuel Pete and Debbies financial troubles; their sex life (or lack thereof); parenting headaches; spousal peccadillos like flatulence in bed. Theres no real crisis let alone serious conflict until the final half-hour when Petes birthday party finally arrives bringing with it a bizarre tonal shift that suddenly turns ""This Is 40"" into something closer to ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf."" Despite a plot that has built up little or no head of steam to that point Pete and Debbie inexplicably explode at each other and at their partners fathers in a showdown that seems to come out of nowhere. Its weirdly intense and it quickly dissipates whatever mild goodwill the characters have been able to generate with the audience. At the very least you expect laughs from an Apatow comedy along with life lessons. And you dont exactly walk away empty-handed. If you stick around for the closing credits youll see outtakes from McCarthys aforementioned meltdown scene. Its hysterically funny just to watch Rudd struggle ineffectually to keep a straight face. ""This Is 40"" is a good-faith effort at a wry and realistic relationship comedy. But the sad thing is that those outtakes are the funniest thing about it.Contains frequent obscenity sexual humor and partial nudity.

"Movie review This Is 40 finds truth amid midlife crisis laughs - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowMovie review This Is 40 finds truth amid midlife crisis laughsJudd Apatows follow to Knocked Up This Is 40 captures a week in the life of a family whose parents (Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann) are trying to find a way to like each other again.December 20 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Pete (Paul Rudd)and Debbie (Leslie Mann) in ""This Is 40."" (Universal Studios )""This Is 40"" Judd Apatows new comic rant picks up the family squabble five years after ""Knocked Up"" left off. Settle in for a major dose of the bratty behavior that has become the writer-directors marquee move because 40 is turning out to be a very good year.Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen the central punch line in ""Knocked Up"" are nowhere in sight and the film is better for it. In fact not since Apatow so thoroughly crashed (and trashed) the romantic comedy scene in 2005 with the foul-mouthed charm of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" has Apatow gotten relationships this right.Pete (Paul Rudd) Debbie (Leslie Mann) and their kids Sadie and Charlotte (14-year-old Maude and 10-year-old Iris Apatow respectively) were only fringe players in the last movie but here they are in the process of coming completely unglued. There really isnt room for anyone elses issues.VIDEO The Envelope Screening Series - This is 40The kids who made their big-screen debut in the 2007 pregnancy fracas have had five years to practice delivering the edgy tirades Daddy Dearest has written for them. Theyve used the time well. But its the adults who are the primary enfants terribles.The particular week in which the film unfolds is marked by milestone birthdays a hes turning 40 shes turning a| well the number varies. They are also in midlife meltdowns that have to do with money and sex a or more precisely not enough of either in their lives.The existential question is not can this marriage be saved? These two are going to tough it out if it kills them. The struggle is whether they can find a way to like each other again a a far more universal question for long-married couples. Given the unrelenting sniping its hard to imagine how the film is going to get there which is probably why its two-plus hours.For the most part Pete and Debbies problems are Hollywood problems a that is to say the kind that only a certain amount of money can buy. Its a gluten-free macrobiotic land of bike lanes 4000 birthday bashes personal trainers couples therapy and debates with the kids on the artistic merit of ""Lost"" versus ""Mad Men."" A life when getting back to basics means dropping Wi-Fi in favor of a hard line and restricting iBook iPad iPhone hours.Its a demographic that Apatow favors. But this time he mucks up their world with dare I say a new maturity and a surprising level of empathy and insight that if not completely missing in some earlier work was increasingly hard to find amid the heaping piles of crude.F-bombs still abound but mortality weighs more heavily than you might expect. A good deal of time is spent undergoing every medical procedure known to man and Debbies mammogram puts Katie Courics colonoscopy to shame.VIDEO The Envelope Screening Series - This is 40The father issues are of a modern type created by well-heeled second families and fertility treatments. Larry (Albert Brooks) is Petes; Oliver (John Lithgow) is Debbies. One is a lovable mooch with young triplets the other so absent he hasnt even met the grandkids a both parts are superbly acted.And just for the record no one has handled Viagra better. The couples randy exchange on the subject only serves as a little comic relief in the face of Debbies real fear shes no longer appealing and Petes relentless concerns about underperforming in all aspects of his life.The film has as much to say about family dynamics as a couples wavering love. The kid issues a the fighting the Facebooking the growing pains a are so spot on you almost forget the language. Sadies flirtation with a young Tom Petty lookalike which triggers a series of confrontations capped by a magnificent Melissa McCarthy implosion is parenting a teen at its worst and best.In truth the filmmaker has always had an eye for telling details a in dialogue and design. Consider Pete. In ""Knocked Up"" he scouted rock bands for a record label. Now he is the record label a floundering indulgence not unlike the hip clothing store Debbie runs like a detached dilettante. His business hangs on a Graham Parker greatest hits album and if youre familiar with the British rocker (more critically acclaimed than commercially viable if youre not) you know how bittersweet and smart the gag is. Parker very generously plays a nearly forgotten version of himself; his old band mates the Rumour show up too.There will be many who wont be able to get past the language in ""This Is 40."" There will be others who will worry that the king of callous has gone soft on them. Im just happy to see one of this generations most influential comic minds back on track a the laugh track.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more The Envelope Awards Insider PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview The Other Woman devolves and dumbs down its...April 24 2014This Is 40 How can Judd Apatows woes be fixed?December 27 2012Megan Fox gets her comedic kicks in on This Is 40November 3 2012The king of GeeksMay 13 2007MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webSeth RogenEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-this-is-40-20121221,0,2931746.story",200,thisis4010,thisis40,latimes

Starring Leslie Mann Paul Rudd and Albert Brooks. Directed by Judd Apatow. (R. 134 minutes.) Judd Apatow has made reviewing ""This Is 40"" really awkward. By doing interviews stressing the connection between his own life and the movie and by casting his wife Leslie Mann and his two daughters in lead roles he has made it difficult to talk about the people in the picture. If you say theyre awful readers might think youre attacking him or his wife and kids and nobody wants to do that. So lets just say going in that the only thing being reviewed here is the movie. All references here to the family are to the fictional family under the working assumption that nothing onscreen resembles any real-life person. And thats the truth because if I had to put money on this I would say that the real problem with ""This Is 40"" is its lack of truth that Apatow wanted to express something about married life and it eluded him. After all no less than Kierkegaard once said that the actual dynamics of marriage are beyond the scope of art and he was the best movie critic of the 19th century. Sequel of sorts A sequel of sorts to ""Knocked Up"" ""This Is 40"" takes subsidiary characters from that earlier comedy Debbie (Mann) and Pete (Paul Rudd) and crafts a story around them. Their marriage didnt look so great in ""Knocked Up"" and now its dead. Debbie and Pete dont listen to each other theyre not attracted to each other and they dont interest each other. Theyre not even nice to each other. Apatow presents these marital problems as routine but theyre catastrophic. This isnt 40. This is hells inner circle. Individually Debbie and Pete act like narcissistic children - and yet their empty and selfish behavior is offered up by Apatow as fey and quirky even charming. At one point the wife yells at curses at and even threatens a little boy who has insulted her daughter online. Later she and her husband (Rudd) lie about the incident to the school principal. How funny. Toilet humor Meanwhile Pete makes a fetish of leaving the door open when hes sitting on the toilet. And if thats not gross enough when Pete becomes concerned about a swelling in his anus he insists that his wife inspect it at close range. I suppose there is a husband out there somewhere who would do that - one who never wants to have sex again at least not with his wife. Lets be clear Everybody is horrible in ""This Is 40"" but thats not the issue. Horrible can be interesting. There are some very good movies about horrible people. The problem is that no one in the movie and no one behind the camera seems to have any clue that these people are horrible. The characters see themselves as in a rut but we in the audience see that theyre in a deep hole and with neither the personal character nor any real motive to climb out. There is nothing in this marriage worth saving. Its easy to see how ""This Is 40"" could have gone bad by accident. Apatow cataloged a series of awful things that might happen within a marriage and then stitched them into a succession of bits perhaps not realizing that the cumulative effect would be a portrait of hopelessness. The portrayal of the children is equally bleak. Iris Apatow as the 8-year-old has moments of droll wit but Apatow leads teenager Maude Apatow toward a one-note performance in which she is almost always angry full of herself and cursing at full volume at her parents. No one can fault a father for being charmed by his own daughter but as a novice she needed closer handling. Self-adoring In passing the movie offers a study in self-adoring privilege. The wife owns a clothing store and the husband owns a record company. A concession is made to the 99 percent out there - we hear that shes just breaking even and that hes losing money - so that we shouldnt hate them for being rich. All the same these are characters who have it remarkably easy which presents yet another barrier to our caring whether they all come down with smallpox. For once Leslie Mann isnt funny. Neither is Paul Rudd. Albert Brooks is funny as Rudds father a moocher who sponges off his son in order to support his brand-new family a wife and small children. Hes not an admirable character but Brooks with his frazzled aggrieved humanity makes him a true one. He lifts every scene hes in - if only he were in more.

Given the comic timing of the charming lead actors--Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann--in a sequel of sorts to 2007s hilarious Knocked Up comic expectations are high. Instead the comedy in this rambling semi-autobiographical account is uneven.The movie is not so much a cohesive story as a series of scenes a collection of ideas that fall under the heading of an overarching theme marriage in middle age.FREYDKIN A family affair for Apatow Mann and RuddOstensibly it covers a week in the life of Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) who have two bright daughters Sadie (Maude Apatow) and Charlotte (Iris Apatow) a beautiful home and more fortune than most. But under the glossy veneer there are problems.Pauls indie record label is teetering on bankruptcy. He has been secretly giving his father (Albert Brooks) infusions of cash. For her part Debbie who owns a clothing boutique suspects one of her employees (Megan Fox) may be stealing. She is attempting to bridge an emotional estrangement with her distant father (John Lithgow).Its a dicey proposition to make a privileged life seem relatable. The complicated problems involving their aging parents and clashes with their children are more universal issues.Dicier still is humorously and authentically documenting the annoyances that rankle every married couple.Better are the more human moments that get funnier in their absurdity. After a fight Debbie and Pete laugh about how much they hate each other and mockingly explain how they would annihilate one another. Debbies suggestion--a slow poisoning--is so bizarrely detailed that it grows hilarious.This is director Judd Apatows least consistently funny movie after a string of winners--The 40 Year Old Virgin Knocked Up and Funny People. But even an inconsistent comedy by Apatow is better than most.There are undeniable laughs that center around Debbies repeated insistence that shes 38 (when shes just turned 40) and comical turns by supporting players like Chris ODowd as one of Petes employees and Jason Segel as Debbies personal trainer. Rudd is always a likable screen presence and Mann is appealing as well. But their continual bickering over the cupcakes he sneaks for instance while mildly entertaining does not make for many laughs.In one of the more humorous segments they learn that their daughter is being harassed on Facebook by a boy in her class who Debbie insists resembles Tom Petty. This leads to a cringingly funny altercation between Mann and the boys mom (Melissa McCarthy). Moments of improvisation are woven into the story and Mann Rudd and McCarthy are masters at it.There are moments of perception and sweetness as per usual with Apatow movies. Its just too bad the movies trajectory is formless and jokes built around petty marital resentments sometimes fall flat.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Paul Rudd Leslie Miller and director Judd Apatow talk about working together again in the new movie ""This Is 40.""

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures This Is 40 Director Judd Apatow Genre Comedy Running time 134 minutes Rated R for sexual content crude humor pervasive language and some drug material With Paul Rudd Leslie Mann Megan Fox Watch Clips The Same Week The Same Week Credit Universal Pictures Poison Poison Credit Universal Pictures Consider the premises of writer-director Judd Apatows first three comedies  A lonely tech salesman (Steve Carell) seeks to end a lifelong romantic drought in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. A mismatched couple (Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl) gets pregnant after a regrettable one-night stand in Knocked Up. A popular but self-centered comedian (Adam Sandler) finds perspective after a grim cancer diagnosis in Funny People. What do all these films have in common? Plenty of things but on the most basic level of plotting theyre about characters embarking on a clearly defined journey -- to lose their virginity to get through the nine months to delivery to either die or recover from cancer. Now consider the premise of Apatows new film This Is 40 A married couple with kids reaches middle age. Thats not a journey thats an existential crisis and it gets Apatow into trouble this time. Despite his background in episodic television like Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared Apatows films have a loose shambling quality that accommodates his actors and makes room for observational humor and scads of improvisation. (The shortest among them runs a full two hours.) In the past sending his characters on a journey however conventional it might be has enforced a structure and discipline on Apatows work that hes by nature reluctant to apply. i While some familiar faces return from Knocked Up This Is 40 also features new characters such as Debbies employee Desi (Megan Fox). Other new faces include Lena Dunham and Chris ODowd. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures While some familiar faces return from Knocked Up This Is 40 also features new characters such as Debbies employee Desi (Megan Fox). Other new faces include Lena Dunham and Chris ODowd. Universal Pictures This Is 40 by contrast has nowhere in particular to go Its an outpouring of raw material an inventory of domestic hassles marital spats and random insights and silliness that inches forward while running in place. Apatows strengths and weaknesses are tied to the same impulse to put as much of himself into the film as possible -- small specific moments coexist with broad comic setpieces and emotional meltdowns that wouldnt be out of place in a John Cassavetes movie. Calling it a mess would be both accurate and pointless because a tidier comedy would squeeze the life out of this vital generous blob of a film. Lifting the characters of Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) from Knocked Up Apatow builds his comedy around a screen family composed of three-quarters of his own casting Rudd as his alter ego and Mann his wife playing mother to their real-life daughters Maude and Iris who star as 13-year-old Sadie and 8-year-old Charlotte respectively. As Pete and Debbie approach the big 4-0 theyre forced to take stock of their marriage their careers and their parenting and they find a host of problems in all three areas. After leaving a lucrative job at Sony to start his own record label Pete has signed an ancient rock band for a 30-year reunion album no one wants. Debbies boutique shop seems to be performing better but it turns out one of her employees (Megan Fox and Charlyne Yi) has been skimming thousands of dollars from the till. And thats just for starters Paul gets guilted into sending money to his put-upon father (Albert Brooks); Debbies biological father (John Lithgow) is no better despite his absence from her life; both nurse not-so-secret vices (Debbie for smoking Paul for cupcakes); neither has any clue how to handle a tech-savvy adolescent without invading her privacy; and they cannot keep their hostilities from forming a toxic cloud that hangs over the whole family. A romantic getaway helps briefly but the moment they pull back into the driveway the old battles recommence. For parents of a like age This Is 40 might seem at times like the years most disturbing documentary so acute are Apatows insights about everything from the stress points of family life to minor matters like Pete slipping away to the bathroom (with his iPad) for a moments peace. But he just as often inserts scenes or characters that are tangential at best superfluous at worst including a brilliant bit with Bridesmaids star Melissa McCarthy as the profane mother of a boy harassing Paul and Debbies daughter. (Be sure to stay for the closing-credit outtakes which are even funnier.) And of course theres a part for Jason Segel as Debbies lusty personal trainer; like the rest it feels shoehorned into place. With This Is 40 Apatow turns his audience into fitfully chuckling therapists dealing with a raft of problems that arent entirely sorted out. Hollywood usually demands an orderliness that Apatow to his great credit isnt interested in imposing on his film. This can get enormously frustrating in the wearying stretches where the comedy cant relieve the psychodrama but it isnt often that material so nakedly personal can fly under the studio banner. His candor should be encouraged.

Apatows latest ""This Is 40"" -- about the financial and romantic foibles of a well-off couple hitting a milestone birthday -- feels like George might have written it or at least directed it. The bawdy wit and crisp dialogue that were the hallmark of Apatows ""Knocked Up"" (of which this is a quasi-sequel) and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" are still very present but the conflicts feel so cushy so first-world that one gets the impression that the filmmaker is losing touch with life as it is lived outside of Brentwood. Not that the wealthy and the privileged cant have problems of their own or cant be the subjects of drama but when characters who drive BMWs hang pricey contemporary art throughout their spacious house go on spa weekends cater lavish parties and have a seemingly endless supply of Sprinkles cupcakes in their kitchen its a little hard to be sympathetic when those same characters wail about their money woes. I was reminded more than once of ""Spanglish"" (also coincidentally starring Sandler) another frustrating movie about privileged L.A. folk a film that made me want Chers character from ""Moonstruck"" to suddenly manifest so she could smack all the characters in the face and say ""Snap out of it"" ""Knocked Up"" sideline characters Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann Apatows wife) return facing the big 4-0 among other challenging issues in their life. Pete left his gig at Sony a few years ago to start an indie label for niche acts and after shelling out for a new album by Graham Parker (playing himself throughout with good cheer) the records not selling. Debbies boutique (selling what the ladies of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" would call ""gorgeous things"") has a 12000 shortfall although shes so obsessed with her age that she never seems all that upset about the missing cash. (Again these are very niche economic problems.) While Pete tries to figure out how he can avoid losing the house while still giving money to his dad (Albert Brooks) Debbie avoids telling her husband the bombshell news that shes pregnant. Meanwhile their young daughters (played by Mann and Apatows kids Maude Apatow and Iris Apatow) are constantly squabbling and Pete and Debbie find it tricky to lay down the boundaries when theyve got vices of their own. (Debbie still secretly stress-smokes; Pete cant stop eating those cupcakes.) As with most Apatow movies ""This Is 40"" works best when characters are talking to each other about the real day-to-day mechanics of relationships friendships sex aging and other relatable concepts. Hes a master at crafting dialogue thats obscenely hilarious and blisteringly honest at the same time and that gift hasnt eluded him. But so much of the film centers around Paul and Debbies privileged trappings (the trainer the iPads) and their impotent attempts to deal with it that its often like being trapped at a restaurant next to a table of people clucking about how you cant find a good nanny these days. And thats a shame because its a waste of some very talented performers who nonetheless give the material everything theyve got. Rudds one of those comic actors who makes it all look effortless but with very little fanfare hes becoming one of our most reliable leading men. For her part Mann makes her character palatable despite a few too many screechy moments and her comic timing is so precise you could set your watch by it. Theyre ably supported by a strong ensemble from the Apatow sisters (very convincing as combative siblings) to Brooks Robert Smigel Jason Segel (as Debbies semi-smarmy trainer) John Lithgow Melissa McCarthy (hilarious as an enraged mom) Chris ODowd and Megan Fox (whose sense of humor and ability to be in on the joke when men around her are swooning over her body make her the millennial Jayne Mansfield -- and I mean that as a high compliment). Absent if you were wondering are Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl from ""Knocked Up"" with nary an explanation. If Apatows previous movies have made you laugh then ""This Is 40"" certainly will as well. But those moments of great comedy are stuck together by a worldview so cosseted that it threatens to muffle an exceedingly talented screen artist. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday December 20 2012 348 PM Title This Is 40 Film Info R Language nudity. Area theaters. Theres a funny movie scratching at the edges of ""This is 40."" Unfortunately writer-director Judd Apatow sees himself as the John Cassavetes of Comedy so every time that funny movie starts to emerge Apatow tramples it with scenes of domestic irritation. The Apatow brand -- which peaked with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" hit big with ""Knocked Up"" got too serious with ""Funny People"" and has fostered many filmmakers and comics -- isnt subtle. Which doesnt excuse his insistence that every bit of banal relationship reality get crammed into this unfocused dramedy. Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) are both approaching their 40th birthdays only Deb is telling people shes 38. He runs a not-very-successful record label in Los Angeles; she operates a funky clothing store. Their two daughters (Maude and Iris Apatow) are 13 and 8 with the older one absorbing and spewing back her parents immature snark. Petes birthday bash is approaching but Deb doesnt want a party remember because like Lucille Ball in 1955 shes lying about her age (despite looking a decade younger). The family is dealing with school issues unexpected medical news kooky coworkers and financial problems as well as Petes cash-poor dad (Albert Brooks) and Debs father (John Lithgow) a spinal surgeon and expert in emotional detachment. Brooks an old hand at making crankiness funny turns the movie around whenever hes onscreen. He likely was allowed to make his scenes his own and knows how quickly kvetchy can get annoying and his so-casual-it-reclines delivery is welcome. But this being an Apatow film its duty-bound to grossness and overindulgence. Theres a home rectal examination wacky conversations during a gynecological check and constant recriminations shouting and whining from everyone. Its like being trapped with someone elses annoying family. The peripheral characters flit in and out long enough to be enjoyable though some are so outsized theyre cartoonish. (Melissa McCarthy as a peevish mom has a cameo that goes from familiar to funny to out of hand.) Pete and Debbie themselves were supporting characters in 2006s ""Knocked Up"" and ought to have remained B-list. Rudd and Mann are great comics whose dynamic here is just snipe bitch ask ""What?"" and repeat. Afterward they tilt their heads and say they love each other -- far too many times for a two-hour-plus movie. Apatows casting of his wife Mann and their kids feels messily chummy but he is a host who loves to mingle so he brings in Jason Segel Robert Smigel Charlyne Yi and Chris ODowd for bits. Theres also Megan Fox as an employee of Debs who doesnt mind her boss feeling her up. Foxs presence and the film can be perfectly summed up when Brooks character deadpans ""That was deeply uncomfortable. Thank goodness that pretty girl was here to distract everyone.""

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""This Is 40"" is a bulls-eye zeitgeist comedy a movie in which everyone acts like real people but funnier. In his fourth directorial outing Judd Apatow gives us plenty to feel good about. Theres a humane empathy for his flawed characters as they grapple with marriage family and encroaching middle age. There are plenty of pointed one-liners that will strike a common chord with audiences and a percolating cast of comedians (Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann Apatows wife as the harried couple Iris and Maude Apatow as their young daughters Albert Brooks and John Lithgow as their fathers). Everyone on screen is charming and maddening in equal proportion. This sort-of sequel to ""Knocked Up"" is wise and satisfying and often sharp and hilarious. After the ""better luck next time"" stumble of ""Funny People"" Apatows back in form. The setting is familiar Apatow territory the luxe but stressed world of Los Angeles creative types. Pete and Debbie (Rudd and Mann) run a struggling indie record label and a profitless fashion store respectively. They share parenting duties with 13-year-old Sadie (Maude Apatow) a bright emotional Category 5 hurricane and 8-year-old Charlotte (Iris Apatow) a cherub with the comic timing of a standup pro. The couple who turn 40 just days apart are doing all they can to deny the calendar. She works out with a trainer to keep sag at bay. He eats cupcakes listens to music all day and bikes all over like a kid. He has an enduring love for the music of his youth struggling to market 80s rocker Graham Parker (nicely playing himself as a wise old coot) to todays audience. He retreats to the john to play Scrabble on his iPad and to music bars to listen to a procession of real-life musicians. She goes out to clubs to dance and flirt. Neither is very good at managing the practical side of daily existence. They alternately over-monitor the kids and ignore them. They set themselves up for trouble by having children before they were done being children themselves though they blame their problems on their own imperfect fathers. Lithgow is a distant WASP iceberg and Brooks is a needy guilt-inflicting failure. ""Its them not us"" Debbie says. ""Totally"" Pete agrees. THIS IS 40  out of 4 stars Rating R for sexual content crude humor pervasive language and some drug material. The film is a comic-therapeutic journey to self-awareness that requires much banging of heads against brick walls. There are funny-profane scuffles with parents and kids at their daughters school (they provoke Melissa McCarthy into firing off a magnificent foul-mouthed rant that approaches free verse). Only when a couple of medical surprises strike do they take accountability for their own shortcomings. When Rudds Zen punch-in-the-head moment arrives its delivered by a gruff guy old enough to be his father but in much better control of his life than Brooks character. The moral here is ""grow up already"" the only way your life will improve is by setting adult priorities and working hard at them. Thats the message of every Apatow film. He has pushed his way to the forefront of American comedy by delivering common sense in funny insightful packages.

More about This Is 40 >> Theyre still struggling. And theyre still funny - talking about sex and having sex or trying to (This Is 40 opens with the two of them in the shower) talking about Simon and Garfunkel talking about impromptu rectal exams and the psychic damage J.J. Abrams Lost is inflicting on their oldest Sadie. The 13-year-old has been binge-watching the entire six seasons of the epically mystifying series. In short This Is 40 in tried and true Apatowian style mixes weighty issues about intimacy and cohabitation with astute and smart-alecky pop culture references crude bathroom jokes stoner riffs boob ogling and existential angst. It is also like Knocked Up (and Funny People with Adam Sandler) a highly personal affair. Writer/director Apatow has again cast his wife the ridiculously charming and wacky Mann and theyve nudged their precocious kids Maude Apatow (shes Sadie) and Iris Apatow (as Charlotte) in front of the cameras once more. Occasionally in the long-ish This Is 40 this celebration of family becomes perhaps too much - too cute too clever too narcissistic parental pride forced on an unsuspecting public. Its like going over to friends and being asked if youd like to watch some home movies - a couple of hours later youre still watching and its beginning to feel um awkward. But awkwardness has always been part of Apatows equation too. The filmmakers alter ego Rudds Pete heads a floundering record label pinning his hopes on a new reunion album by 70s pub rocker Graham Parker and his band the Rumour. (Parker gamely pokes fun at himself and the image of an aging quasi-rock star.) Pete has missed his mortgage payment is behind on the bills is still supporting his deadbeat dad (Albert Brooks) and has neglected to tell Debbie about the mess theyre in. And in Debbies corner the boutique she runs is only just making it and she suspects her employee Desi - the bombshell Megan Fox amusing and amused - of embezzlement. Apatow regular Jason Segel (a fitness guru beamingly showing off his work on Debbies glutes) comic Robert Smigel (Petes bike-riding buddy) Charlyne Yi (Debbies depressive shop worker) Chris ODowd and Lena Dunham (Petes record company staffers) join the fray. Albert Brooks as Petes father sounds like a good idea but its a strange role part mooch and part crank and the other father figure in the movie - John Lithgow as Debbies long-estranged surgeon dad - is even weirder. In This Is 40 as in life middle-aged parents have to deal with their parents and thats not always easy. So This Is 40 is messy. But see it for its honest insights its laughs and for the terror Manns character as a mom defending her emotionally wounded daughter rains down on a toothy school kid whos been sending unflattering texts. Manns verbal assault is hysterical in both senses of the word. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com. Read his blog ""On Movies Online"" at www.philly.com/onmovies.

Comments (1) click to enlarge This Is 40 Rated R  134 minutes  2012 As the most successful comedy producer in Hollywood Judd Apatow has always coached people to mine their own lives for laughs and for his fourth feature as writer-director (after The 40-Year-Old Virgin Knocked Up and Funny People) hes also mined his own for the cast. Paul Rudd stars as the owner of an independent record label and playing his glib overprivileged media-saturated family are Apatows wife Leslie Mann and daughters Maude and Iris Apatow. They eat up a lot of screen time without being very funny and because of Apatows improvisatory style the reflections on middle age promised by the title seldom rise above the level of Mann complaining about her breasts. Albert Brooks and John Lithgow come along for the ride as the married couples flawed fathers and there are bit roles for Jason Segel Annie Mumolo and Graham Parker as himself. But this is too much like a 35-million smart phone filled with kids pictures. By J.R.

"Movie review Apatows This Is 40 hits close to (his) home - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Apatows This Is 40 hits close to (his) home Share Tweet Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 12.20.12 | 243 PM ""This Is 40"" is a midlife crisis movie. The twist is that its a marriage having the crisis. We last saw Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) advising Debbies sister Alison for better and mostly worse in ""Knocked Up"" (2007) a breakthrough film for writer-director Judd Apatow. There the two served as an antic Greek chorus; here theyre the whole show. (The first films stars Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen are nowhere to be seen.) The movies a contradiction in terms -- a personal Hollywood comedy -- predicated on commonality of experience. Apatow who has been slowly moving in this direction since 2009s ""Funny People"" knows that many of us will relate to his pair of frazzled married-with-kids their lies and subterfuges the way they hate each other while yearning for the days when they loved each other like crazy. The director is reaching so deeply into his own mishegoss that he has again cast his wife Mann and their two daughters Iris and Maude as the couples children. It seems almost ungentlemanly for Apatow to insist a well-groomed Hollywood actor play himself. Dude man up Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The kids are sharp little players even if you feel like youre being forced to watch someone elses home movies at times and the two leads throw themselves into the free-for-all with relish and knowing humor. ""This Is 40"" is fairly plot-free charting as it does Debbies passive-aggressive freak-out over turning 40 and Petes stewing in the juices of looming business failure. Sex or the lack thereof is a frequent topic. His independent record label is bleeding cash; her clothing boutique is on oxygen support. Shes a secret smoker hes a secret lender of money to his deadbeat dad (Albert Brooks). Both of them careen around Greater LA railing to their assorted friends about their miserable dead-end existences and were meant to laugh and recognize ourselves -- or at least the people next door. We do and we dont because Apatow may simply be too close to his subject. ""This Is 40"" has some real laughs -- Paul and Debbie talk to each other with the salty bluntness of two people used to seeing each other in the bathroom -- but in shooting for the universal the movie hits the generic. Apatows better with the supporting roles which he fills with familiar faces Megan Fox as Debbies vavavoom shopkeeper Chris ODowd as Petes long-suffering label employee John Lithgow as Debbies distant father Jason Segel (narcissistic personal trainer) Charlyne Yi (two-faced salesclerk). Because Apatows a well-connected music junkie Ryan Adams Billie Joe Armstrong and Graham Parker all play themselves the latter serving as a genial running joke the oldies act whos serene in his irrelevance. The best scenes -- the only time ""This Is 40"" taps into genuinely messy comic anxiety -- feature Brooks who shpritzes shabby false confidence as Petes pop saddled with a younger wife and triplets he cant tell apart. Otherwise the movie never quite comes to a point. Those of us in the target demographic (guilty as charged) may settle in hoping for farcical insights and walk away wondering why were paying for something we can get at home for free. There are hints that Apatow means to satirize his woolly headed strivers. When a schoolmate taunts one of the daughters online Debbie goes hilariously medieval on the kid (Ryan Lee) -- her cruelest taunt is that he looks like Tom Petty -- after which Pete backs her up with a scathing verbal assault on the kids mom (Melissa McCarthy dropping in from ""Bridesmaids""). These scenes are horrifyingly funny not least because Pete and Debbie are briefly reunited through the shared high of their obnoxiousness. When ""This Is 40"" clicks its bracingly honest about the self-absorption of privileged suburbanites -- both the us-against-them and the me-against-you. At an overlong 134 minutes though the movie increasingly seems like a parade of White Peoples Problems. Apatow doesnt have the distance of a genuine comic observer of human foibles -- a James L. Brooks for example -- and he never breaks out of his bubble which in this case isnt just Los Angeles but the upscale Brentwood neighborhood where the filmmaker lives. ""This Is 40"" is smart about the things that stall marriages -- the way we retreat to corners nurse grudges forget how we got here in the first place -- but its blind to any notion that a larger world or other sorts of people might exist. That may be a more accurate reflection of its makers outlook than he realizes. I hate to say it but if Judd Apatow wants to be a seriously funny filmmaker he may have to leave home.

Related links Comedy in Apatows everyday life inspires a film By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 148pm on Thursday Dec. 20 2012 Thursday Dec. 20 2012 Friday Dec. 21 2012 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Judd Apatows last movie as a director was Funny People which attempted to plumb the psyche of a stand-up comedian with a terminal illness. He returns to the edgy rom-com territory of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up with This Is 40 a good-natured and warmhearted but only intermittently funny look at middle-aged domesticity.This Is 40 is actually a sequel of sorts to Knocked Up but instead of focusing on that films main characters played by Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl Apatow follows their married friends Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann Apatows real-life wife). Its five years later and Pete and Debbie both of whom are approaching their 40th birthdays are in the midst of a midlife crisis. The indie record label Pete owns is struggling Debbies clothing store seems to be doing only marginally better (and one of the employees is a thief) and theyve got two headstrong daughters to raise (played by Apatows real-life daughters). The fire that once provided the heat to their marriage has been reduced to a flickering flame.Unlike in some of the previous films with which Apatow has been associated as either director or producer there are no shocking or gross-out moments unless you consider Pete taking his iPad to the bathroom with him a household capital crime. No ones hairy chest is getting waxed ( The 40-Year-Old Virgin) and no bridesmaids relieve themselves in bathroom sinks ( Bridesmaids of course). This Is 40 plays out more like real life and while its admirable that Apatow who also wrote the script hasnt shoehorned in outrageousness just for the sake of it theres not enough here to justify the 134-minute running time.The most shocking element -- for those whose knowledge of rock music runs deep enough to know the British scene of the late 70s -- is how good Graham Parker remains. A once-celebrated rock n roll bad boy who never quite crossed over to America the now-62-year-old Parker playing himself is signed to Petes label and gets to perform with his old band the Rumour. Its a nice touch and a cool shout-out to those who like Apatow have an affinity for rock n roll underdogs.Its also good to see Apatow working with veteran actors like Albert Brooks (who plays Petes financially distressed dad) and John Lithgow (Debbies emotionally distant dad) both of whom turn in strong performances.There are some chuckle-worthy small moments as when Pete and Debbie argue over Petes use of a drug to enhance his sexual performance or when Pete is trying to figure out how to keep his record label alive. His wife and kids want him to move in a more LMFAO or Rihanna direction. Petes not having it.But there are few laugh-out-loud scenes. Yet maybe thats the point. That life isnt about the grand gesture but the little day-to-day details that keep us grounded and human.Still it seems as if Apatow couldve been just slightly more succinct in making that point. At least there are no hobbits involved.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

RELATED NEWS Interview Judd Apatow Paul Rudd needs dose of comedy By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Dec 20 2012 1118 AM Arguments in most comedies are usually nothing more than plot contrivances designed to add a little slapstick or easy laughs to the story a break on the way to something else. Writer and director Judd Apatow takes a different approach with ""This Is 40"" a comedy that doesnt shield us from the difficulties of sustaining a marriage even while it makes us laugh hard. In this film fights are bracingly realistic uncomfortably so. Thats by design of course. Its a necessity really because the fights are the central means of communication for Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) a married couple celebrating if thats the word their 40th birthdays within days of one another. They seemingly exist to argue about everything sex money relationships kids parents schedules and any other aspect of life you can think of. (Food. Yeah food. And smoking. And health in general. You get the idea.) If you recognize the characters its because they appeared in Apatows 2007 hit ""Knocked Up."" They served as a cautionary tale for the characters played by Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl. (You dont have to have seen the first film to understand or enjoy this one; Rogen and Heigls characters arent even mentioned.) For all the funny lines Apatow has always been interested in at least recognizably realistic portrayals of his characters. Here one might argue that he goes too far in that regard. Similar complaints were lodged against the great television series he worked on ""Freaks and Geeks."" It was too true to life some thought. Wait till they see this. That said the fights serves a purpose. For these characters at this point in their lives it makes sense. That doesnt make it easy to sit through particularly the ones that start with pick-pick-pick and then explode into things better left unsaid. Hurtful things made more so because of the bitter sting of truth. Oh and just so you know its also really funny. Debbie turns 40 first though shes insisting that shes really only 38. But she does want to make some changes in her life and those of her family. Better eating no more sneaking smokes (her) or doughnuts (Pete) vastly limited Internet and TV (daughters played by Apatow and Manns real-life children Maude and Iris). Pete tries to climb on board. His hearts not in it but what the heck hes getting older too. Hell give it a shot. Besides he has other problems. His boutique record company is struggling unbeknownst to Debbie. She also doesnt know that hes still funneling money to his mooching father (Albert Brooks sterling in his portrayal) long after he assured her he wasnt. Meanwhile Debbie and her father (John Lithgow) barely communicate at all. Hes a rich surgeon but has a new life a younger wife a child. Hes moved on. As you might expect this makes Debbie feel left out at best. The accumulation of pressures and secrets will prove too much of course. Theres nothing revolutionary in Apatows story. Whats different is the way he tells us forcing us to observe things we dont want to see. Whether they are hard to watch because they hit close to home or simply because watching two people fight isnt the most pleasant thing in the world will depend on your experience. But its something. So how can this possibly be something you would want to sit through you ask? Because of the honesty involved. And the humor. Its as blistering as ever in an Apatow film the vulgarities mounting until they topple you over. (Be sure to stick around after the credits for outtakes of Melissa McCarthys flat-out brilliant obscenity-laced screed.) Some of it is grounded in absurdity some in real life; Rudd and Mann excel at finding the funny in both places. But dont be misled. We arent used to comedies that make us squirm like this. That doesnt mean they arent worth our time. ""This Is 40"" is. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Universal Pictures Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann in ""This Is 40."" Universal Pictures photo For Debbie (Leslie Mann) 40 is the new 38. Shes a married mom with a mortgage but she also loves Lady Gaga fibs about her age and covets the lifestyle of the twenty-something hottie who works in her trendy boutique (Megan Fox).Debbies husband Pete (Paul Rudd) has maturity issues of his own. He runs a struggling record label dedicated to niche new-wavers from his youth spends hours playing video games in the bathroom and binges on cupcakes when Debbie isnt looking.The financial and familial pressures that spill from the closet during Petes round-number birthday celebration disguise ""This Is 40"" as an adult drama but the movie is more like an adolescent comedy with a really good fake ID. As with ""Knocked Up"" in which Pete and Debbie played supporting roles writer and director Judd Apatow has cultivated a rich terrain between insight and silliness that was unknown until he planted his seed there.Although Apatows garden parties are inviting it should be noted that they have a rather restrictive guest list. He continues to make overlong movies about privileged Angelenos whose problems are relatively small.Debbie is miffed that Paul needs Viagra for a bout of birthday-present sex in their roomy shower and sad that she is estranged from her wealthy surgeon father (John Lithgow).Paul is bummed out that the new album by Graham Parker amp; the Rumor isnt selling and annoyed that he has to lend money to his deadbeat father (Albert Brooks). Theyre both peeved that their daughters (real-life Mann-Apatow offspring Maude and Iris Apatow) would rather play with their gadgets than build forts or converse with their parents. From this sitcom-caliber raw material Apatow squeezes out a two-hour 15-minute film and holding our attention for most of that questionable length is a credit to his sharp allusive writing and his repertory cast of likable actors. The fact that Rudd and Mann have an old-shoe ease with each other even when their characters are supposed to be bickering further lifts the material and clues us that it wont veer into a valley of dark surprises.With Apatow associates such as Melissa McCarthy (as a classmates foul-mouthed mom) and Jason Segel (as a flirtatious fitness trainer) making extended cameos its puzzling that ""Knocked Up"" co-stars Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl dont show up at the backyard bash of their brother-in-law. (And God forbid we should have to sit through a disc of deleted scenes to learn the whereabouts of Debbies and Petes mothers.)But the few quibbles that arise from ""This Is 40"" are easily forgotten. After copping out in ""Funny People"" Apatow still hasnt set the table for a meaty drama but making us laugh is a piece of cake.What ""This Is 40""  Three stars out of four  Run time 215  Content Sexual content partial nudity strong pervasive language and some drug material Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

CAST Paul Rudd Leslie Mann Maude Apatow Albert Brooks LENGTH 214 In Judd Apatows ""This Is 40"" Pete and Debbie (Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann) are back as the beleaguered spouses from 2007s ""Knocked Up."" Its Apatows chance to make another generation-defining comedy this one aimed at former indie-rockers who suddenly find themselves skateboarding off the cliff of middle age. If anyone could find the humor in that sense of impending doom it would be Apatow. Right? ""This Is 40"" turns out to be an opportunity squandered. Instead of trying to connect Pete and Debbie to their counterparts in the audience Apatow delivers a traditional (if rather raunchy) family film that tries to be more heartwarming than funny. This isnt ""Knocked Up 2"" but more like a reworking of ""Parenthood."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? In this telling Debbie manages a clothing boutique while Pete runs a small record label. (Age-wise Pete should be a child of the alt-rock 90s but he idolizes the 70s singer Graham Parker.) For two people confronting mortality they seem pretty settled into their roles attending to the various schoolyard dramas of their spunky 8-year-old Charlotte and moody teenager Sadie (played by Apatow and Manns children Iris and Maude both very engaging). There are sexual temptations -- Jason Segel plays Debbies touchy trainer Megan Fox is a buxom salesgirl -- but Apatows scattered script makes little use of them. Apatow wastes nearly half his time wringing soggy drama from Petes needy father Larry (Albert Brooks) and Debbies distant dad Oliver (John Lithgow) and he repeats several jokes from ""Knocked Up"" including a drug trip in a hotel room. Rudd and Mann still have their charm but ""This Is 40"" doesnt ask them to do much more than bicker and make up. There used to be something special about Pete and Debbie. Now they feel disappointingly average.

"This is 40 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; this-is-40 ) This is 40 (United States 2012) December 20 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli This is 40 has the feel of one of those French ""family comedies"" - sort of like the kind of thing brought to the screen by Cedric Klapisch except with more profanity and vulgarity. Theres not much in the way of a conventional narrative. This is 40 is essentially a window into the life of an upper middle-class American family over the course of a two-week period. Not much happens as we become privy to the ups and downs of the ""married with two children"" setup. Theres a lot of truth in what writer/director Judd Apatow puts on screen (much of which is undoubtedly drawn from his own life and marriage) but like many French films of this genre it runs too long. As engaging as the characters are 135 minutes is too much time to spend in their company. The movie starts losing steam around the 90 minute point and doesnt make it to the finish line on a high note. This is 40 is being touted as a ""sort-of sequel"" to Knocked Up. Although the two movies share some of the same characters - Debbie (Leslie Mann) the ""sister"" in Knocked Up and Pete (Paul Rudd) have been elevated from secondary players to the leads - This is 40 stands on its own. Theres no need to have seen the earlier movie to appreciate this one. A few other minor Knocked Up characters make appearances but the principals from the earlier film are noticeably absent. (One wouldnt have expected an appearance by Katherine Heigl in view of her public comments about Knocked Up and it might be odd for Seth Rogen to have a cameo without her.) Apatow does a good job of charting the uncertain waters of marriage - the tears the arguments the moments of clandestine sex interrupted by children and the love and affection that are often masked by more immediate frustrations. He speaks from experience. This is 40 is comprised of vignettes some of which work better than others. To a lesser degree it contemplates aging with Debbie refusing to acknowledge that shes 40 but (thankfully) were not subjected to a mid-life crisis for Paul. Hes having financial troubles but isnt tempted to stray. Debbie has an opportunity or two but never comes close to biting. This movie isnt about infidelity or temptation; its about how two people make a marriage work even when sometimes divorce might seem like a better option. The film is at its weakest when it heads off on tangents not directly related to the central characters. One subplot involving Megan Fox and Charlene Yi playing Debbies employees would have been better left on the cutting room floor. Although Foxs acting has improved dramatically post-Transformers shes still on hand mainly because of her body and Yi is simply awful. Another vignette which involves Melissa McCarthy as the mom of a buck-toothed kid is more awkward than funny. The movie is long enough that scenes like these feel like padding that would have been better placed as supplemental material on a home video release or incorporated into a longer ""directors cut."" This is 40 has its share of honest and at times tender moments. Perhaps the most enjoyable sequence in the film follows Debbie and Pete on an overnight ""getaway"" that allows them to rediscover each other. The return home is also perfect. Apatow takes time to explore Petes relationship with his father (Albert Brooks)who believes that the concept of ""family"" means sharing money and Debbies interaction (or lack thereof) with her dad (John Lithgow) a spinal surgeon who walked out when she was eight years old. The structure might be French but the style is very much Apatow with scenes of intense profanity and unparalleled vulgarity. Theres evidence of improvisation throughout the film and apparently Leslie Manns topless scene was her idea. (Note Unlike her ""topless"" scene in The Change-Up which used CGI to accomplish the nudity this is Manns real chest. I guess having her husband on the other side of the camera established the necessary level of trust.) Apatow also has a point to make about the commercialization of music by establishing Pete and Debbies musical tastes as diametric opposites. For Apatow this is a true family affair. In addition to having his wife as the female lead his and Manns children Maude and Iris play the two daughters (both are reprising their roles from Knocked Up; they also appeared as different characters in Funny People). His good friends and frequent collaborators Paul Rudd and Jason Segel are key members of the cast. Of all Apatows films this may be the most personal. It has a straight-from-the-heart feel that allows his numerous observations about family marriage aging to feel more honest than trite. Many viewers will relate to Pete and Debbie because they will see themselves in the characters. In This is 40 Apatow illustrates something were aware of but dont often consider our personal dramas are in many ways not unique to our lives but are universally relatable and repeatable. And although This is 40 is too long and at times over-the-top its essence is grounded in everyday moments and emotions that will have viewers nodding with understanding and recognition.

"This is 40 (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review This is 40 (R) Director Judd Apatows comedy about a married couples midlife crisis is a disaster. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com12/20/2012 Editor rating 1.5 This is 40 is billed as a ""sort of"" sequel to Knocked Up and it is in a way. But while the movies have some of the same characters -- namely Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) the married couple who acted as foils to Seth Rogen and the pregnant Katherine Heigl in Knocked Up -- they couldnt be further apart in tone and execution.  Knocked Up was crude and hilarious with a terrific supporting cast that enhanced the film. This is 40 is crude and dull with a supporting cast that reminds you how utterly uninteresting the main characters are. The blame for this disaster lies with writer-director Judd Apatow whose self-indulgence is starting to reveal itself in unpleasant ways. He has cast his wife (Mann) in a lead role shes not strong enough to carry and he has cast their daughters as her children. To be fair as kids in supporting roles go the girls are fine and fairly inconsequential although they have more screen time than strictly necessary. But then again maybe criticizing Mann is unfair. Kristen Wiig or Tina Fey would have trouble making this dated material funny and the usually reliable Rudd struggles too. The plot of This is 40 goes as follows Pete and Debbie are turning 40 and neither is particularly happy about this fact. You know the drill because youve seen it a million times. They dont have enough sex. They fight about money and the kids. Apatow dredges up every couples cliche out there Men fart in bed and are hilariously addicted to the music of their youth and visit proctologists Women make you eat healthy and lie about their age and sometimes even swear None of this stuff has been amusing in decades although if not for some of the more inventive vulgarities the movie wouldnt be funny at all. A well-placed F bomb or oral-sex joke doesnt always save a dead-end scene but sometimes it helps. Because the flimsy plot isnt even close to justifying the running time -- Apatow still has not learned that a comedy longer than two hours is a comedy sorely in need of editing -- more material is required. And so the script piles on a looming financial crisis because Pete keeps lending money to his deadbeat dad (Albert Brooks) despite the fact that his fledgling record label is failing. Apatow bogs down hard in the details here; the record-label storyline is so tedious that even fans of Graham Parker who figures prominently will be fidgeting. As for Petes financial troubles Apatow seems out of touch. He probably hasnt had to worry about cash flow for awhile but the idea of a struggling middle-class husband casually giving away 80 grand without his wife knowing is pure convenient fantasy. There are also subplots about whos stealing money from Debbies business (which leads to one of the movies rare funny lines though it cannot be repeated here) and another about Debbies father (John Lithgow) who shows up after a lengthy absence for no real reason. But none of this matters because This is 40 is marching toward an obvious resolution. For all his irreverence Apatow is a traditionalist and his main objective here is touting the value of marriage no matter how many penis jokes he makes along the way. What This is 40 gets right is some of its secondary characters like the excellent Melissa McCarthy (Bridesmaids) as a furious mother and the hilarious Jason Segel (The Five-Year Engagement and Forgetting Sarah Marshall both far better movies) as a personal trainer. They bring energy to this lifeless film but there is a downside They remind you how much fun funny can be.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Apatows This Is 40 Way Too Many Scenes From a Marriage Writer-director Judd Apatows meandering ""sort-of"" sequel to Knocked Up starts strong and funny but falls flat in its second hour By Mary Pols MaryPolsDec. 19 2012 Share Read Later Universal Pictures This Is 40 Year 2012 Director Judd Apatow Studio Universal Pictures Actors Paul Rudd Leslie Mann Jason Segel Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture In Judd Apatows riotous Knocked Up the marrieds Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) represented what awaited Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogens characters as they contemplated the leap into parenthood. Making the grass on the other side look fairly parched both actors did deft memorable work particularly Mann; her whiny-but-self-aware mother of two was the kind of droll character you wanted more of. Five years later here Mann is again as Debbie in This Is 40 a movie writer-director Apatow has described as the ""sort-of"" sequel to Knocked Up and some wags on Twitter have described rightly as This is 40 Minutes Too Long. (It is 2 hours and 14 minutes.) This comic tale of marital doldrums is a demonstration of Apatows signature generosity as a director he loves actors he loves improvisation he loves being on set. Maybe too much. This Is 40 doesnt go on quite the narrative walkabout his Funny People did but it needed a savage edit. (READ Joel Steins 2009 profile of Judd Apatow) Yet it starts strong on the morning of her 40th birthday Debbie perches at the window of her bedroom wearing rubber gloves and a towel over her hair sneaking a cigarette swabbing herself with baby wipes and gobbling gum afterward. The middle-aged woman hiding her vice rang so terrifically true it made me laugh aloud. As Apatow introduces his themes (sagging body parts and sex lives as both Debbie and Pete turn 40 in the same week financial trouble is-this-all-there-is woes) there are similar sharp observations about modern life--although it must be said a very white upper middle class life. Subplots are everywhere but go nowhere in particular. Between Pete and Debbies two workplaces (his record company her high-end boutique) and their fathers (Albert Brooks and John Lithgow respectively) This Is 40 is stuffed with supporting players. Brooks is mooching off Pete and Debbie in order to support his IVF-engineered triplet toddlers who he cant tell apart. Lithgow visits so rarely he doesnt recognize his own grandchildren. Pete is trying to make the amiable 80s rock star Graham Parker (who is 62) hot again (even his employees played by Chris ODowd and Lena Dunham consider this hopeless). Debbie is trying to figure out which of her two employees (Megan Fox and Charlyne Yi reprising her Knocked Up role) is stealing from the till. Pete and Debbies daughters Sadie (13) and Charlotte (8) are played by the same young actresses who had the roles in Knocked Up Judd and Leslies daughters Maude and Iris Apatow. Maude succeeds in projecting some of the gloomy edge of a real teenager while Iris bless her performs in much the same way most of your friends sweeter children do when called upon to show off their talents which is to say dutifully with an eye on the exit or perhaps the far more entertaining American Girl doll waiting in the next room. On matters such as parent-child relationships schools and pop culture Apatows writing is briskly on-target and quite funny. Ill chuckle every time I think of one of the movies best sight gags the grey-haired pregnant lady walking through Sadie and Charlottes school looking at least 55. Same for the bit about Lost. Sadie uses various electronic devices throughout the movie to watch episodes of the show which shes seeing for the first time and Pete mocks her obsession with it. ""I dont make fun of your Mad Men"" she retorts. Which she adds sucks. From the shots hes chosen to highlight from Lost Locke at a typically tense dramatic moment Jack lying on the beach having his epiphany in the last episode its seems Apatow gets the allure of Lost--I bet in real life he and Maude watched it together--but can step outside it to acknowledge the shows inherent silliness in retrospect. (READ TIMEs review of Knocked Up) What he isnt able to do presumably because its just too personal is step outside the allure of this narrative and see what is inherently silly about Pete and Debbies ""crisis"" and how it drags down the narrative. As the movie goes on the laughs are fewer and farther between and for the last 30 minutes not only did I not laugh I wanted it to end so I could get back to my own boring but less precious life. The movie lacks any urgency--theres no way Pete and Debbie will ever break up. They fret about not liking other but theres never any question that they do; they just like bickering nearly as much as they like each other. We never see a real fight an ugly knock-down drag out marital blow-up. We see artificial snappy battles that might call to mind the screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s if they werent so resolutely cute in a 21st century self-absorbed kind of way. Pete and Debbie but particularly Debbie are so busy adroitly commenting on their own responses and emotions that none of their responses and emotions feel genuine. And the material starts to contradict itself. At about the midway point Pete and Debbie go away for a blissful naughty weekend in Laguna. They swim drink enjoy a medicinal marijuana cookie order room service and to the best of my recollection have sex. (Mann and Rudd have no sexual spark. When Melissa McCarthy in a small funny part as a contentious parent from the girls school accuses them of looking ""like theyre in a bank commercial"" shes right; theyre that bland together.) In Laguna they discuss their mutual love; its gushy and happy. Then a few scenes later during an interminable party sequence Pete tells Debbie. ""Its not your fault you cant feel love."" Huh? What about Laguna honey? What about earlier compliments to her awesome loving mothering which requires she feel love? Within 15 minutes theyve decided theyll be fine waving off all the problems we were supposed to care about. (SEE Where Apatow landed on the TIME 100) In contrast Knocked Up though it also ended with unrealistic softness seems like the height of focus and narrative drive. Speaking of Given how bloated the second half of the movie is--it has middle-age spread--couldnt Apatow have thrown Knocked Up fans a bone and at least mentioned Alison (Heigl) and Ben (Rogen)? Bens buddy Jason (Jason Segel) now Debbies personal trainer comes to the big birthday party scene. Debbies distant surgeon father (John Lithgow) participates in a discussion of his lousy parenting but Debbies sister never comes up. No one says hey where is Alison and that dope she married? Heigl did some post Knocked Up dissing calling the film ""a little sexist"" but does that mean shes so dead to Apatow that Alisons name cant even come up in normal conversation? Or maybe she and Debbie had a fight about who was more self-absorbed. That I could see. Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

"This Is 40 review Leslie Mann in her prime | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThis Is 40 review Leslie Mann in her primeThe official start of middle age makes for an unsettled time of life a feeling Judd Apatows This Is 40 mostly gets right in all its untidy comic sprawl.Paul Rudd is reliably good and Leslie Mann really good as a couple reaching mid-life in This is 40.  (Suzanne Hanover / Universal)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 20 2012 This Is 40 (out of 4) Starring Leslie Mann Paul Rudd Albert Brooks John Lithgow Jason Segel and Megan Fox. Written and directed by Judd Apatow. 134 minutes. Opens Dec. 21 at major theatres. 14A Midway between your first kiss and your first pension cheque age 40 marks lifes grand divide for most people. You can no longer pretend youre a kid but you flinch at being addressed as ""Sir"" or ""Madam."" You still enjoy going out but staying home with the family the TV and a pizza is less trouble. In short its an unsettled time of life a feeling This Is 40 nails in all its untidy comic sprawl. Cannily aimed both at Generation Xers now reaching the Big 4-0 and Baby Boomers who remember this traumatic milestone (the soundtrack goes from grunge to classic rock) its the most seasoned picture of the four written and directed by comedy kingpin Judd Apatow. Its also the most personal Apatow just turned 45 while his wife Leslie Mann who co-stars in the film with Paul Rudd reached 40 earlier this year. Manns character Debbie and Rudds character Pete were the fractious married couple in a subplot of Knocked Up Apatows pregnancy comedy of five years ago. They now move to centre stage for what Apatow calls a ""sort of"" sequel to his earlier film. Debbie and Pete squabble merrily away as if Knocked Up never ended. After some 14 years of marriage Debbie and Pete are still hanging in there through the good the bad and the ugly (the latter include hemorrhoids and rectal exams). But as they both turn 40 in the same eventful week the sex/money/love/attention issues that test all marriages loom larger than ever. A sexy opening scene in a shower suddenly turns from hot to hurtful when Pete makes a surprise revelation. Pete will later complain to a pal ""Were in one of those phases where everything that the other person says annoys the s--t out of each other."" He and Debbie both run their own companies -- he has an indie record company she has a clothing store -- but both firms are hemorrhaging cash. Their daughters Sadie and Charlotte (Maude and Iris Apatow the director and Manns real-life children) are at the respective ages of 13 and 8 changing from being precocious into a real handful. They all live in an implausibly nice house even by Hollywood movie standards. Both drive fancy cars and the family has enough iMacs iPods iPhones and other gizmos to stock a small Apple store. Yet theyre in danger of losing it all because of chronic overspending and money mismanagement made worse by Petes insistence on lending thousands of dollars at a time to his sponge of a dad (Albert Brooks funny man). Debbie has the opposite problem with her wealthy father (John Lithgow straight man). He has all the cash he needs but hes so aloof and distant he cant even remember the names of his granddaughters. The movie frequently shifts from comic to dramatic and back again true to Apatows whiplash style but also true to life. An acknowledged admirer of James L. Brooks and the late Robert Altman Apatow shares their penchant for extraneous subplots and unnecessary characters but the diversions are frequently worth our time -- even if the films total running time of 134 minutes is a tad indulgent. Petes reckless love of music leads him to sign and promote the reunion of aging New Wave cult rockers Graham Parker and the Rumour which provides both nostalgia and satiric bite as fandom proves fickle. Parker enjoys sending himself and the music biz up aided by such Apatow troupers as Chris ODowd (Bridesmaids) and Lena Dunham (TVs Girls). Debbies fear of aging (and bankruptcy) sends her on a wild night out in the company of her saucy and suspect store employee played by Megan Fox with a hitherto unseen sense of comic timing that goes a long way toward easing her post-Transformers doldrums. This Is 40 equitably looks at middle age from both sides of the gender divide but whereas Rudd is reliably good Mann is really good even when all those subplots and second characters start to wear. Watch the quicksilver reactions on her face when she gets unexpected news both happy and daunting. Its one of many moments when Mann makes This Is 40 more than just another laugher about going middle-aged crazy.

"Review This is 40 - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Judd Apatow misses chance to go deeper with This Is 40  1/2 Video Michael Phillips picks the top 10 movies of 2012 From Amour to Zero Dark Thirty the top 10 films of 2012 by film critic Michael Phillips. From Amour to Zero Dark Thirty the top 10 films of 2012 by film critic Michael Phillips. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune More like ""This Is Whiny"" ""This Is 40"" has its share of clever zingy material proving that writer-director Judd Apatow has lost none of his ability to land a punch line with the right unexpected turn of phrase. ""My boobs are just ... gone"" bemoans Debbie played by Leslie Mann comparing hers with the newer models belonging to her boutique employee played by Megan Fox. Then comes the second line building smartly on the setup ""They didnt even say goodbye.""Married to Apatow in real life Mann has two daughters who both appear in the film as the central couples kids. Paul Rudd plays Pete the struggling record label founder a character (like Manns) introduced in the earlier Apatow picture ""Knocked Up."" ""This Is 40"" is Apatows fourth as director following ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"" and ""Funny People"" and it displays a growing sense of fluidity and craft. Hes finding ways to keep a simple two-person dialogue scene interesting enough for his fly-on-the-wall relationship observations.So why is the film a bit flat? Its an attempt at a more bruising brand of comedy than he has tried in the past and clearly this is personal territory. The marriage on view has seen one too many sarcastic arguments one too many resentments one too many cold stares where the ""Im sorry"" should go instead. But much of the script feels oddly dishonest and dodgy at least to me; each time one of the Mann/Rudd verbal smack-downs takes over Apatow has a habit of cutting away at the messy escalation points. Why make a movie like ""This Is 40"" if you cant go all the way? ""Funny People"" started out similarly well and bravely before settling for less and less.What are this couples problems? Most of the them would qualify as The Usual. You know. Money problems Petes label is on the verge of insolvency and hes secretly supporting his genial mooch of a father played by Albert Brooks. Intimacy problems; the sex has cooled. Debbie and Pete have in her words become more like ""business associates"" or brother and sister than an actively connected couple. Debbie becomes pregnant spurring further doubts about the solidity of the marriage.Apatow has always been best with scenes that have the least bearing on the story. ""This Is 40"" strains to accommodate this loose generous ensemble impulse with more hackneyed ones such as the uneasy reconciliation between Debbie and her father (John Lithgow). The film culminates in a badly timed birthday party for Pete but the stakes feel low.Mann is wonderful a uniquely skillful comic and dramatic actor -- wide-eyed yet merrily devastating when the venoms called for. Rudd can get away with murder on sheer charm. But its easy and sort of lazy to establish jokes and entire scenes built upon mocking somebodys dialect or the older daughters obsession with ""Lost."" Apatow can do better. And has.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Ever since Judd Apatow made his debut as a writer-director in 2005 with The 40-Year-Old Virgin the knock against his films has been that their more inspired moments are undercut by the overall bloat. Apatow has a reputation for being too in love with his own creations to force them into the shape of a proper movie with a story that develops at the pace most screen comedies do. This Is 40 is unlikely to change the minds of Apatows critics. Its 134 minutes long and substitutes loosely related situations for plot. But a few broadly comic moments aside This Is 40 also captures the rhythms and concerns of real life in ways that slicker Hollywood comedies dont. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann reprise their characters from Apatows Knocked Up playing an upper-middle-class Los Angeles married couple raising two adorable daughters while dealing with their own persistent communication problems. In the years since 2007s Knocked Up the kids (played by Maude and Iris Apatow) have grown into a 13-year-old and an 8-year-old which brings new parenting challenges but as Rudd and Mann both prepare to turn 40 theyre finding that troubles at home are being back-burnered by troubles at work. The boutique Mann owns is missing a large sum of money which has likely been stolen by one of her two shopgirls sexy Megan Fox or mousy Charlyne Yi. And Rudds dream of starting an indie record label to promote his favorite aged musicians is about to die because nobody buys music any more--least of all from ancient rockers. Apatow stuffs all of this and more into This Is 40 the money troubles the struggle to protect children from harm in the iPad/Facebook era and the way Rudd and Mann often seem to be working at cross purposes. Apatows understanding of what real American families are going through is hampered to some extent by his being an L.A.-based millionaire. For a couple in danger of losing their businesses and their home Rudd and Mann seem to spend money freely on resort vacations and lavish parties. They also spend time exercising and hanging out with their buddies that might be more profitably spent at the office or with their children. Also Apatow thinks too much like a TV producer at times allowing his movie to be hijacked for a few minutes here and there by colorful characters like Melissa McCarthy (as a foul-mouthed fellow parent who locks horns with Rudd and Mann when her son insults their daughter on the Internet) and Chris ODowd (as an inept Rudd employee who keeps pissing all over his bosss plans). The scenes with those actors are fairly funny but their minutes add up and This Is 40 doesnt really need help filling out its running time. Then again without Apatows willingness to let his films find their own way This Is 40 might not have found room for its two best supporting performances Albert Brooks as Rudds deadbeat dad who has a new wife and young kids of his own and John Lithgow as Manns emotionally distant father who also seems more attentive to his second family than he ever was to Mann. Apatow gives Brooks the license to be as loose and acerbic as hes been onscreen for a good while and the characters cranky ""life stinks but whatre you gonna do?"" attitude contrasts well with Rudds anxiousness. Lithgow meanwhile is largely absent from the film until the last act when he comes to Rudds birthday party and reveals that his daughter doesnt understand him as well as she thinks she does. Apatows interest in parental dynamics--including the way Mann tries to micromanage her children while Rudd just tries to entertain them--gives the movie more depth. Similarly Apatow makes sure that the characters pop-culture obsessions--which include Lost for the teenage daughter and Graham Parker for Rudd--are more than just passing references. Theyre integrated into the story and theme of the movie becoming case studies in how theres more to life than just material success. Even with Apatows insistence on going for the joke--especially if the joke involves whats inside of or emerging from any given characters ass--he doesnt shy away from the brutal truth of whats going on in these relationships or from offering a broader perspective on them. So This Is 40 shows Rudd and Mann casually lying to each other and insulting each other and not-so-silently bearing the burden of being in the middle years of a marriage that at this point would be harder to dissolve than to endure. But they also love each other and maintain a roadmap for where theyre headed together all while coming up with crazy new life-changing plans that they try their best to execute. The couple at the center of This Is 40 is like the movie itself funny and thorny and trying to be exceptional even if that means making dumb understandably human mistakes.

More than anyone else hes forged todays idea of funny. And since that idea is a marked improvement over yesterdays - mixing topicality and improv Apatow rescued big-screen comedy from its lengthy wallow in the trough of dumb-and-dumber - we have good reason to thank the guy. Until now. In This Is 40 his fingerprints are still identifiable but not nearly as crisp. Theyre starting to look smudged. Watch This Is 40 official trailer As the title hints this is a comic take on that most banal of human predicaments - the midlife crisis. Or to be precise a midlife crisis as experienced by fairly affluent fully self-obsessed carbon-frame-bike-riding dare-I-eat-a-cupcake-worrying folks like Pete and Debbie. We first met the couple in Knocked Up. Now with both on the cusp of their 40th birthday the opening scene spots them steamily making out in the shower only to have their coitus interruptus by Petes brazen admission. Proudly he took Viagra ""I thought you would think it was fun to super-size it."" Whiningly she takes umbrage ""We are young people. We dont need medication to have sex."" Fretfully we take stock The scene is a little funny more than a little shrill and way more than a little precious.Ditto the whole picture. Once again Paul Rudds Pete is joined on camera by Apatows off-screen wife Leslie Mann along with their actual children Maude and Iris. Because theyre all good comic actors even the kids the trouble here isnt with the incestuous casting. Instead its with the inbred script where the plot is scant (seems the twosome have cash-flow problems) but the parallelism is relentless. Beginning with the shared birthdays and shared narcissism the whole thing unspools as a succession of matching squabbles and perfectly balanced set-tos - seems its the winter of their duelling discontent.So on come the his-and-hers sequences. Like their duelling bad habits Shes a closet smoker hes a closet cupcake devourer. Like their duelling business woes His retro record label is bleeding money; her hip dress shop has a thieving employee. Like their duelling doctors appointments His proctologist wags an impolite finger; her gynecologist tells an impolite joke. And like their duelling father issues since each dad sports a trophy bride and a second brood His (Albert Brooks) is an ever-present moocher; hers (John Lithgow) is a never-present stranger.The list continues and while bouncing from one matched set to another the pair squabble make up squabble again make up again - yep just like the print dresses in her chic shop even their discord has a pretty pattern. Amid such ordered chaos where you might ask are the laughs? Short answer in the improvised riffs. Whether munching on a marijuana cookie or pondering how to kill each other both Rudd and Mann are at their funniest when dropping lines off-the-cuff.So is the small army of Apatow acolytes who pop up in interspersed cameos - among them Jason Segel Chris ODowd Charlyne Yi especially Melissa McCarthy. But like the stars their riffs double as blessing and curse - often amusing mainly unquotable yet weirdly inorganic poking out of the ho-hum story like a bunch of red pins on a grey map. In that sense the improvised stuff redeems the movie even while accusing it.After a few more neatly balanced squabbles (arguing Simon versus Garfunkel Lost versus MadMen) the climax looms at the birthday bash where everyone gathers to whisk the crisis out of midlife and stick the happy into ending. Thats also where Apatows fingerprints really get smudged as sweetness blurs into saccharine and sardonic into sentimental. As for those cash-flow problems hey only the toughest question gets asked here Can a happy family in a big house still be a happy family in a slightly less big house? In the intermittently funny and consistently precious frames of This Is 40 downsizing is a cupcake without sprinkles.

A few years back Brad Paisley one of Nashvilles best wrote and recorded a wry waltz whose lyrics compared the odds of newlyweds lasting to those of an airliner making it to its destination. He concludes on the chorus ""If love was a plane nobodyd get on.""But we still board despite knowing those odds. And nobody bucks against them harder than writer/director/producer Judd Apatow who has committed himself not only to matrimony but with This Is 40 to something even less likely making a good movie about it. He hasnt quite succeeded but he hasnt made a bad one. In fact the biggest problems with Apatows messy sprawling perceptive comedy have more to do with his goals than his execution. Jeanine Basinger diagnoses the difficulty he faces in her forthcoming book I Do and I Dont A History of Marriage in Movies ""Marriage had no story arc"" Basinger writes describing old Hollywoods reluctance to examine life after courtship. ""A good movie was usually a story told in a hurry--good pacing being one of its best characteristics. Marriage took years to develop and mature.""So its easy to carp that This Is 40 is too long too aimless too alert to small resentments and too stingy with the comic set pieces and gel-capped life lessons that made Apatows Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin such hits. Its even easier to complain ""The trailer promised big laughs and lots of triumphs but other mostly the movie is devoted to showing us Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd pickle in each others presence.""Film Details This Is 40 RatingR GenreComedy Running Time133 min. More Info Thats all true. But those resentments are sharply observed and the pickling is honest more familiar from life than from movies and almost always droll if not laugh-out-loud funny. A scene of husband Pete (Rudd) upsetting wife Debbie (Mann) with his bed farts is tinged with tragic truth--what is marriage but the process of acclimating to each others gasses? More painful still is the moment when Debbie seeking sex bares the breasts she has been worrying over as her 40th birthday approaches--only to be rebuffed as Pete monkeys with his iPad. (Mann is Apatows real-world wife and the children in the movie are Apatow and Manns real-world children so all this naked truth stuff is complicated.)Occasionally Apatows gifts for comedy and pain come together beautifully. Debbie and Pete laugh in bed about how much they hate each other sometimes and then how exactly they would murder each other. Her answer--a slow poisoning--gets more involved as she describes it and Mann makes the most of her showcase She plays it as if Debbies both pleased by the fantasy a little turned on but also a little upset by it--and more than a little invested in one-upping Pete. Debbie is the first female character in an Apatow film as engaging and fucked up as the boys.Rudd dampens his natural charm but hes funny when not brooding. The Apatow children though are both marvelous. One searing eruption from Maude Apatow age 13 at the time of filming marks the films emotional high point.This Is 40 offers story beats but nothing like a story. The family is having money troubles which stands to reason considering both Debbie and Pete have cute movie-character jobs She runs a teensy boutique and he owns a record label that only releases music by over-the-hill alt-rockers. (Pete is a dick about his belief that rock music being the only real music and his principled devotion to Graham Parker threatens his familys lifestyle.) Meanwhile between fights and reconciliations the couple frets about turning 40 endures unsatisfying visits to and from their fathers (Albert Brooks and John Lithgow) and tries to ween the family off wifi and junk food. That last story element is somewhat baffling The fit Rudd and Mann do not at all look like the scared-of-salad schlubs theyre playing.What the movie most resembles is a ""harold"" one of those improv shows where the troupe takes one suggestion and then develops inter-related comic scenes based on everything that suggestion might possibly contain. Some scenes work; some dont. Only one is as funny as those in Apatows first two films--it involves an agitated Melissa McCarthy--and a couple break the films reality. Pete suggests to his kids that rolling a rubber tire with a stick is just as fun as playing with their many i-devices and its impossible to tell if hes joking. If he is hes not funny; if he isnt hes too dumb for us to invest in.Apatow hasnt quite beaten the odds and the film--like his undervauled Funny People which improves with re-watching--will play best for audiences who know what theyre in for. Much like marriage This Is 40 is somewhat formless and it almost never hurries up. But life is improved by having the option.

Matt Taibbi on How Trumps Disastrous RNC Doomed the GOP This Is 40 By Peter Travers December 18 2012 More News The Best Movies of 2012 All Stories >> Judd Apatow makes comedies that count. He knows that staying true to character is the best way to make humor a portal to deeper feelings. Apatow didnt have to look closer than home to find his inspiration for the high-spirited hilarious and surprisingly prickly This Is 40. Paul Rudd as Pete and Leslie Mann as Debbie are reprising the supporting roles they had in Apatows Knocked Up five years ago. But this time Pete and Debbie are in the center ring. And since Apatow is married to Mann and their two daughters Maude and Iris are playing their two daughters on screen its clear This Is 40 is a family affair with Rudd standing in for Judd. More News The Best Movies of 2012 All Stories >> In his fourth film as a writer-director following The 40-Year-Old Virgin Knocked Up and Funny People Apatow probes deeper into the emotional challenges you dont find codified on a marriage license. Pete and Debbies seemingly ideal life in L.A. is invaded by secrets. While not exercising to maintain their gym tones Debbie sneaks off for smokes and Pete scarfs down cupcakes. Is it age nagging at them? Or something more disturbing about self-image in the youth mirror that is L.A.? Pete and Debbie try to brush off the pressures of decreased intimacy in a depressed economy. His job at an indie record company is threatening to topple off the fiscal cliff. And her clothing store featuring Megan Fox and Charlyne Yi as employees is being victimized by an inside thief. But Pete and Debbie soldier on slinking off for a romantic resort weekend that only backfires when the strain shows. Apatow is an expert at spotting the fissures in a relationship. Thats what makes This Is 40 so potently painfully funny even when its gross. What other film would dare suggest rectal monitoring as a form of closeness? Judd Apatows Universe Freaks Geeks and Everyone in Between There are big laughs here and smaller ones that sting. Rudd and Mann are a joy to watch especially when their comic darts draw blood as when Debbie tells charmboy Pete that inside hes a dick. Cheers as well to a terrific supporting cast including Melissa McCarthy as a mother from hell John Lithgow as Debbies withdrawn father and the priceless Albert Brooks as Petes dad living off his sons dole to support his tow-headed triplets. This Is 40 doesnt build to a catharsis. It sometimes dawdles as it circles the spectacle of a marriage in flux. Yet Pete and Debbies sparring yields some of Apatows most personal observations yet on the feelings for husbands wives parents and children that we categorize as love.

By David Denby Kathryn Bigelows movie chronicles a long trail of frustration leading to fragmentary gains and at last to success in Abbottabad.   Credit Illustration by Concepcion Studios In ""Zero Dark Thirty"" the masterly new movie directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal a C.I.A. field agent has an Al Qaeda operative in his grip. The agent whose name is Dan (Jason Clarke) a tall handsome guy with a bushy brown beard subjects the prisoner to ""enhanced interrogation""--a full complement of pain naked humiliation and waterboarding. ""This is what defeat looks like"" Dan tells the operative who is named Ammar (and is played with sympathy by the French actor Reda Kateb). These words are spoken at a C.I.A. ""black site"" in Pakistan in 2003. But most of the movie is about American defeat--the failure to capture or kill Osama bin Laden as Al Qaeda pulls off attacks in Saudi Arabia Britain and Pakistan. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" chronicles a long trail of frustration leading to fragmentary gains and at last to success on the night of May 1 2011 Operation Neptunes Spear a Navy SEALs siege of bin Ladens hideout in Abbottabad which is so perfectly executed that it almost defies normal skepticism about the way life works. The virtue of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" however is that it pays close attention to the way life does work; it combines ruthlessness and humanity in a manner that is paradoxical and disconcerting yet satisfying as art. Ammar may be working for Al Qaeda but hes also a human being and hes suffering. Yet in attempting to show in a mainstream movie the reprehensibility of torture and what was done in our name the filmmakers seem to have conflated events and in this they have generated a sore controversy the chairs of two Senate committees have said that the information used to find bin Laden was not uncovered through waterboarding. Do such scenes hurt the movie? Not as art; they are expertly done without flinching from the horror of the acts and without exploitation. But they damage the movie as an alleged authentic account. Bigelow and Boal--the team behind ""The Hurt Locker""--want to claim the authority of fact and the freedom of fiction at the same time and the contradiction mars an ambitious project. The movie begins at the primal moment the screen is black as we hear the frightened voices of people trapped in the World Trade Center on 9/11. That misery and abjection is what the hunt is all about. The C.I.A. unit charged with finding bin Laden isnt just trying to prevent further attacks; its openly seeking revenge. Boal who began his career as a reporter for Playboy and Rolling Stone interviewed some of the principals involved. What we see--the anger and the desperation; the terse anxious exchanges among agents; the breathless chase through crowded Pakistani streets--is stunningly detailed and convincing from scene to scene. It also moves with juggernaut speed. Even the pauses the silences the instances of reflection push the narrative along. In this movie thinking is action. There is someone else at that interrogation session an observer who wears a black hood and removes it to shake out a glorious curtain of reddish-gold hair. This is Maya (Jessica Chastain) who becomes the key C.I.A. investigator into bin Ladens whereabouts. Maya based on a real agent whom Bigelow and Boal have elevated out of agency anonymity is an obsessed woman with no personal life or interests. But Bigelow chose an appealing actress to play her Chastain has a slightly distraught look a sudden smile a warm-spirited responsiveness. Maya winces at American cruelties and grieves over the death of colleagues in failed operations. Unlike Claire Daness troubled bipolar Carrie in the TV series ""Homeland"" Maya is as sane as daylight but nevertheless single-minded about killing bin Laden. Dan exhausted by his duties returns to Washington but Maya stays in the field along with the Islamabad station chief (Kyle Chandler) whos a Bush Administration functionary; an ambitious operative (Jennifer Ehle); and a surveillance specialist (the impressively sombre Edgar Ramirez). Mayas theory is that bin Laden cant communicate with his network by cell phone or Internet so he must be relying on a courier. The movie turns into the ultimate procedural in which computer work matching photographs and one seeming irrelevancy after another in an old interrogation video lead Maya to a man known as Abu Ahmed who at regular intervals drives a white S.U.V. from Peshawar to a house in Abbottabad. Mayas investigation has been going on for years but as shaped by Bigelow and Boal the hunt feels like one continuous surge of energy colored by anguish and fury. At first no one takes Maya seriously. But her demands on the agencys resources become increasingly insistent culminating in an enraged moment in which--as Chastains neck engorged swells mightily--she threatens the C.I.A. station head with exposure for incompetence if he doesnt give her what she needs. That a woman is leading the charge is almost as surprising to the Americans as it is to the Muslim prisoners. After all the female avengers of the past fifteen years--Uma Thurman and Angelina Jolie kicking men in the ego and other places--American movies have at last produced a woman clothed like Athena in willful strength and intellectual armor. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a puzzle that keeps changing and re-forming; were held by fleeting references by the workings of Mayas calculations. Bigelow and the cinematographer Greig Fraser make fluid but firm use of a handheld camera without excessive agitation so that you feel pitched into the middle of things but also see clearly what you need to see. A sequence in which a Jordanian who may provide access to bin Laden approaches an American military installation is drawn out to a level of almost unendurable suspense. Two unexpected bomb explosions throw you back in your seat; they have a ferocious power that makes most movie explosions feel like a mere perturbation of digits. The raid begins with beautiful shots of Black Hawk helicopters taking off at night silhouetted against a few brilliant lights. The journey across the mountains from the base in Afghanistan to western Pakistan is conducted in darkness and quiet like a sacred ritual. The SEALs are older and beefier than you expect--big men in their late thirties who nonetheless move smoothly as if their legs were on finely calibrated springs. Bigelow and Fraser shot the sequence twice accumulating forty hours of footage that was edited down to twenty-five minutes of sepulchral green-tinted action--what you see through night-vision goggles. The raid is a methodical room-by-room exercise in deadly aggression that is without parallel as a display of force in recent movies. Bigelow presents bin Ladens corpse and Mayas emotions after the kill with considerable circumspection. An example of radical realism this movie has its mysteries as well as its devastating certainties. ""I was forty and then I blinked and there I was gonna be ninety"" an old woman says to Debbie (Leslie Mann) who is herself just turning forty. Such is the murmuring subtext of ""This Is 40"" Judd Apatows very funny new comedy times winged chariot is hurrying near. Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) a Los Angeles couple with two daughters are hitting early middle age and Apatow has arranged their discontents (with themselves with each other with their parents) into a generous and vibrant series of confrontations and fights all garnished with wisecracks of startling pungency. Debbie and Pete are both exercise freaks but shes a secret smoker and hes a not-so-secret cupcake eater and each indulgence is treated as a taste of mortality. In Los Angeles time has a particular poignancy since the body can never be young enough to satisfy an unsustainable ideal. Debbie owns a boutique and she wonders at the firmness of the breasts of a young employee--a salesgirl played by Megan Fox no less--even squeezing them to make sure that theyre real. They are. Then Fox says ""By the time Im forty these are going to go National Geographic on me."" Were back in Apatow country familiar from ""Knocked Up"" and ""Funny People."" (Debbie and Pete are the other couple from ""Knocked Up"" and Leslie Mann who was in both movies is married to Apatow.) There is the bourgeois household with its chaise longue in the bathroom its iPads its BMW and its Lexus its sunshine always outside the window. Here is all the plenitude and warmth and the triviality and sadness of Los Angeles life. In this case the gleeful abundance is suffering some temporary troubles Pete is an independent record producer devoted to an aging--and low-selling--rock musician Graham Parker (who appears as himself) while at Debbies boutique someone is stealing money from the till. At home Debbie and Pete are running out of both cash and libido and have begun tearing each other apart. Manns happy-face buoyancy fades in an instant into resentment and malice--the switch to a mean tongue is her favorite comic device. Paul Rudd has a handsome jaw and a great smile. Pete at forty is still a boy--moody selfish and dishonest. Rudd has been playing one version or another of this character for years and he has some of his giddiest moments ever as Pete drives his daughters to school while belting out songs that his wife hates and eating forbidden cheeseburgers. For Apatow one guesses the only things that can forestall death are comedy (the movie is full of superb comics including Albert Brooks and Melissa McCarthy) and the flourishing of his children Maude and Iris who appear in the movie as Debbie and Petes daughters performing with all the sweetness and anger that any children might feel around their parents coupled in this case with near-professional aplomb.

He eats chocolate cupcakes -- many many more of them than his wife Debbie (Leslie Mann) a major nutritional scold would suspect. And when hes feeling beyond overwhelmed he heads for the bathroom with his tablet to access ... his favorite porn site? No to play Internet Scrabble. Its a sign of what his life has become that this is his notion of a grand escape an oasis of me-time. If neither of these jokes strikes an amused chord of recognition in you then you may find This Is 40 to be mildly funny at best. But if they do resonate you may chuckle with knowing pleasure throughout the movie. The comedies that put Apatow on the map (Knocked Up The 40 Year-Old Virgin) took off from broadly italicized concepts but This Is 40 lets you know in its title that its less about a concept than a state of being. Pete and Debbie were supporting characters in Knocked Up and now theyre turning 40 with two lovely daughters (nicely played by Apatows own daughters Maude and Iris) and two crusty fathers (a terrific Albert Brooks and John Lithgow) who each have young families of their own. The couple still love each other but their relationship is a mess -- a whirlwind of fights lies negotiations teamwork good sex bad sex and general confusion. The whole tone of the movie is spontaneous rolling experiential. Its got some laugh-out-loud lines especially when the two jump into the politics of Sadies middle school or when Pete is dealing with the business he owns a struggling boutique music label devoted to the white-guy indie rockers he grew up with and still thinks are cool. The joke is no one else does -- not even Graham Parker (playing a version of himself) Petes latest relic-legend who knows his records wont sell. That said a lot of the best gags in This Is 40 are the ones that percolate between the lines. The comedy is there in how Pete leaps like a puppy to do his wifes bidding without realizing that hes already in the doghouse for not having taken the initiative himself; or in the way that Apatow never once stages a marital-therapy session -- but has Pete and Debbie lapse into the euphemisms of therapy-speak even as it still sounds like they want to kill each other. This Is 40 isnt always hilarious but its ticklishly honest and droll about all the things being a parent can do to a relationship. And why its still worth it.

Leslie Mann a soulful fretter whos always best in projects directed by her husband allows their two girls to appear in the movies this time in larger brattier roles than in Knocked Up (of which This Is 40 is a spin-off). Completing the new comedys household as an indie-label-founding dad is Paul Rudd who as a four-time Apatow vet must feel like a close cousin at least. The intimacy among cast members is what makes the latest film soar half of the time. While TV offers similar neurotics on a weekly basis no one else in Hollywood is as hip as Apatow to todays domestic squabbles to home-office negotiations to ""be happy"" casual bed farting and the parental banning of iProducts. But this free-form episodic bickering--majestic though it sometimes is--doesnt feel like quite enough for a story and even though a pair of side plots involving remarried parents (nebbishy Albert Brooks and waspy John Lithgow) are well acted they dont amount to the kind of catharsis youd expect after two hours. The peripheral ensemble (of which Megan Fox as a mysteriously moneyed shop clerk emerges as the most intriguing) strains with underwritten sketch parts. Why is Apatow allowing for so much slackness? It all comes down to the Big Birthday Party and a furious bike ride which hes clearly done before in The 40 Year Old Virgin. As his title implies he could have taken a deeper plunge into the main task of middle age revision.

But despite a slew of broad jokes the focus is pretty narrow Married adults enduring the titular realization against a bland suburban backdrop; their constant struggle to enjoy each others company pay the bills and care for their children go unquestioned. Traditional values glue them into place even when they grow uneasy. Welcome to the world of white people problems ground zero for the strain of American comedies that Apatow does best. But does he really? ""This is 40"" certainly features deeply personal intentions on the part of the filmmaker exploring a married couples ritualistic passage into middle age by drawing from experiences he and wife Leslie Mann have recently endured. While technically a return to the universe of his much goofier (if similarly bloated) man-child opus ""Knocked Up"" the new movie is an attempt to position every yuk in a greater dramatic context. Supporting characters in ""Knocked Up"" Debbie (Mann) and Pete (Paul Rudd) continue to eke out a stable existence while caring for their growing children Sadie and Charlotte (Apatow and Manns real children Maude and Iris). Unlike any of Apatows earlier movies none of the fundamentals of the main characters situation are inherently funny. Its married life the movie with gags in place just to nudge things along. The funnier parts of ""This is 40"" have nothing to do with Petes failing record label Debbies similarly unstable clothing store their waning sex life or their older childs growing rebelliousness. Instead the best punchlines involve an iPad. Pete routinely sneaks into the bathroom with it to play videogames instead of spending time with the clan. Sadie cant stop using it to marathon episodes of ""Lost."" The parents use the device to hack their older daughters Facebook account and discover how she has handled a bully. Ironically these moments maintain a greater sense of authenticity than the bigger issues at stake Pete sneaking money to his leech of a father (Albert Brooks) Debbie attempting to make amends with her own estranged dad (John Lithgow) and the couples dwindling sex life lack wittiness or surprise. Theyre merely puzzle pieces in the drama of the couples lives. The movie has been designed to probe the various anxieties and regrets the couple has endured over the years and so it moves along with less plot than heated exchanges and observational minutiae involving their growing discontent. Apatow and Mann may have magnified their struggles for all to see but only through the prism of qualities that ensure ""This is 40"" has mainstream appeal. As with his other movies the message is fairly conservative an affirmation of the need to maintain family stability against all costs -- or go crazy trying. Occasional vulgar indulgences provide the sarcastic edge that most of the proceedings sorely lack such as the Brooks characters semi-joking suggestion that he kill a few of his younger children to loosen up his bank account. Mainly though Apatows script uses random jokes as fuel to explore the institution of domesticity ultimately celebrating it. Never once does either character mention the word ""divorce"" or take seriously the prospects of infidelity. No matter how frustrated they get Pete and Debbie know they must stay together. It wasnt always this way. Apatows earlier works demonstrate a brilliant penchant for capturing the gulf between innocence and maturity. The single season of ""Freaks and Geeks"" that put Apatow on the map remains one of the best narratives about the pratfalls of teen life in modern times. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" while unfocused maintained the same fundamental sweetness in their snapshots of men resistant to societys demands. At a certain point however Apatows stardom gave him the authority to inject more of his personality into his storytelling and the legacy overtook his capacity for nuanced humor. The bloated dramedy ""Funny People"" was an aggressively pompous look at stand-up comedians dark lives while ""This is 40"" comes across as a full-fledged work of narcissism -- a two hour-plus studio comedy about the Apatow broods ordinary crises with no reason for its heft other than the directors popularity. It might be easy to shrug off this kind of ego-driven strain of popular Hollywood filmmaking because Apatow has good intentions. Lena Dunham (who briefly pops up in ""This is 40"") would never have made the leap from writing and directing ""Tiny Furniture"" to translating her distinctly wry snark into the hit HBO series ""Girls"" if Apatow hadnt given her the chance. The director has similarly advocated for great filmmakers like Greg Motola and David Gordon Green. Few celebrity entertainers have the capacity to help their peers and actually invest time in doing it. Meanwhile Apatow continues to make underwhelming self-important dramedies mistaken by large swaths of moviegoers for representing the dominant strain of comedies concerned with American family life. Its a lot more complicated than that. Take for example the definitively funnier and more astute ""Gayby"" which hit theaters earlier this year. Jonathan Liseckis relentlessly witty take on a thirtysomething woman and her longtime gay pal deciding to father a child together bucks the conventional notion of family values while celebrating the daring involved in pushing against those exact boundaries. Frank V. Ross quietly perceptive ""Tiger Tail in Blue"" (which remains for no good reason without distribution) explores a young married couple stuck in a cycle of unfulfilled desires but constantly incapable of finding the words to communicate their dissatisfaction. The movie maintains a funny-sad tone in each scene that suggests comedy doesnt have to exist outside the reality of any given scenario. (Unlike ""This is 40"" Ross dares to make a moment of infidelity amusing without mocking its grave implications.) The mixed race coupling of Julie Delpys ""2 Days in New York"" (in which she stars alongside Chris Rock) finds complex neurotic and sophisticated married people capable of far more thoughtfully entertaining arguments than the cry-me-a-river antics of upper class strife in ""This is 40."" Apatows writing lacks the sophisticated humor found in any of these movies but will probably make more money than all of them. Even as individual scenes drift along with a competent investment in throwaway lines and decent performances the movie has nothing to offer beyond the implication that youre better offer taking lifes obligations with a shrug. Worse it assumes audiences will nod knowingly and play along. With an awareness that alternatives exist we can do better. Criticwire grade C HOW WILL IT PLAY? Opening on December 21 nationwide ""This is 40"" stands a chance at a decent box office performance over the course of the holiday weekend and could maintain a solid commercial standing into the new year. Its prospects as a major awards season player are dicey although it has a good shot at Golden Globes recognition.

She assumes (while I might agree) that a couple that is opposed to getting divorced or cheating is self-evidently bad. This critique is made as if infidelity and pushing boundaries are necessary to a good comedy or that Apatow is interested in the same subject matter she is. Reply Muh May 12 2016 246 pm I hate filmmakers doing movies about their personal lives and how we should care about them. I prefer Michael Bay making Transformers 4 we can see robots doing things Or maybe we could have another ninja or zombie movie Ugh stupid director who made money and sold out I liked him better when I hadnt heard of him. Reply Darren May 12 2016 246 pm ""Welcome to the world of white people problems"" at this point I stopped reading this review and wondered if Eric Kohn was African American. After a quick google search including an image search I concluded rather quickly that Mr. Kohn is not a minority unless you consider hipster poseur a minority. In any event the film may be awful but I would like to know what Mr. Kohn knows about non-white people problems to assess whether his review has any credibility. Reply Jenna May 12 2016 246 pm I thought I wanted to see aThis is 40a but after the reviews and comments Iam on the fence to see this film in theaters. I was interested in seeing this movie because my co-worker at DISH watched this movie and she is an avid Paul Rudd fan. I really liked aKnocked Upa but I donat think I want to sacrifice the 14+ to see this movie. Iam going to wait until this movie is released on DVD. I have a Blockbuster home account through DISH and once this is released I will add it to the top of my movie list; I can pick this up from the store instead of waiting for it in the mail and send it back when Iam done which is much more convenient for me. Too bad Apatow missed the mark with this film; it looked like there was plenty of potential for a good movie. Reply Boogieman May 12 2016 246 pm Im not going to pay money for another one of Apatows 50 million home movies staring his annoying wife and kids. Reply Scott May 12 2016 246 pm Oh the psychological horrors of being good looking rich with an awesome house beautiful kids and two businesses. Yep - this is representative of everyone I know. Reply Peggy Pattis May 12 2016 246 pm Freaks and Geeks was created and written by Paul Feig and that is why it is different than any of the other Apatow films that were written and directed by Apatow. Do your research...Paul Feig brings an entirely different rich world to life in his work. Reply Grace May 12 2016 246 pm I think it looks funny - for TV. At 14.00? It should be a sitcom - I could get all of the jokes and none of the cost. Reply tomas May 12 2016 246 pm You lost me at Gayby. As someone who has been to many a LGBT film festival I have to say the film is indeed relentless but distinctly not witty. Unless you havent heard the few thousand gay-best-friend quips from Parting Glances through Will and Grace and onward. Reply Skippy May 12 2016 246 pm 134 minutes? I can find about fifty movies from the 1930s that run about 80 minutes and pack more comedy and wit into each of those minutes than youll probably find in this whole mess (Im sorry I know I havent seen it but a comedy that runs this long with this slight a plot clearly has problems). Reply tom May 12 2016 246 pm I agree with your review entirely... but not with your grade. This is a film with no message Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Judd Apatows instincts have rarely been sharper wiser or more relatable than in ""This Is 40"" an acutely perceptive emotionally generous laffer about the joys and frustrations of marriage and middle age. Boasting the empathy texture and underlying seriousness that have characterized the filmmakers output this warts-and-all family portrait is anchored by splendid turns from Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann reprising their already full-bodied supporting roles from ""Knocked Up."" Although a more mature work than its 2007 predecessor in every sense ""This"" is still a bracingly ribald foul-mouthed affair that will score as a year-end crowdpleaser and home-format favorite. Apatows house style is by now so well known his imprimatur such a fixture of the mainstream comedy landscape that its startling to remember that ""This Is 40"" is only his fourth feature as a writer-director. It also happens to be his most fully realized Less high-concept than ""Funny People"" ""Knocked Up"" or the similarly titled ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" Apatows script simply charts the progress of everyday family life over the course of an eventful three-week period in which Debbie (Mann) and longtime husband Pete (Rudd) both kiss their 30s goodbye. From its candidly observed first scene in which a hot-and-heavy lovemaking session suddenly goes south the picture wastes little time getting audiences on an intimate basis with its characters and the indignities of midlife middle-class malaise. These include another scene of coitus interruptus a his-and-hers montage of invasive medical exams and numerous casual discussions of flatulence and bowel movements; its the stuff of any number of raunchy comedies but played here in a manner that not only elicits laughs but also strips away everyones defenses to probe the soft vulnerable places underneath. Debbie who insists on telling others shes still 38 impulsively initiates a household self-improvement plan no more cigarettes for her no more junk food for Pete and much less time spent on the Internet for everyone. This last restriction doesnt sit well with their Facebook-obsessed daughter Sadie (Maude Apatow) who at the difficult age of 13 finds herself increasingly at odds with her parents and her 8-year-old sister Charlotte (Iris Apatow). The universal pressures of raising kids right eating well exercising regularly keeping the house tidy maintaining sexual passion and weathering the distractions of the technology age prove remarkably fertile subject matter for a comedy and Apatow takes his portrait of marital strain one step further by delving into the familys finances. Debbie who owns a clothing store suspects one of her employees (Megan Fox) is stealing from the till while Pete who runs a record label has a habit of signing critically respected commercially hopeless acts. It doesnt help that he cant stop lending money to his freeloading father Larry (Albert Brooks). Rather than pivoting on a single development ""This Is 40"" weaves all these stresses and concerns into a complex but seemingly off-the-cuff story structured according to the push-pull quarrel-and-reconcile rhythms of Pete and Debbies relationship. Even if they hadnt already been established in ""Knocked Up"" these characters would be instantly recognizable Hes goofy laid-back slightly cowed by being the only guy in the family and desperate for some alone-time; shes high-strung shrill extremely capable and anxious about losing her youth and beauty. That they still love each other is more than apparent when they sneak away to a resort for a few blissful nights of sex pot and room service enjoying an all-too-brief respite from the usual hustle-and-bustle. As accessible as Pete and Debbie are as characters they also benefit from Apatows distinct verbal acumen swearing like sailors often reverting to self-shielding sarcasm and defending their singular pop-culture tastes with die-hard enthusiasm. Rudd layers his good-guy demeanor with a sardonic edge that can ignite when provoked into full-blown rage. Mann meanwhile shows a quicksilver brilliance in a role that reveals strong reserves of compassion and complexity beneath a testy impatient surface; when Debbie makes an alarming discovery halfway through the picture the wordless play of inchoate emotions on the actress face is something to see. The ensemble is studded with superb supporting players many of them Apatow alums Melissa McCarthy as another kids belligerent mom (yielding some of the funniest end-credits outtakes in recent memory); Jason Segel as Debbies smug personal trainer; and Chris ODowd as Petes lazy assistant. Fox comes off surprisingly well locating unexpected pathos beneath her supermodel veneer. Yet the standout is Brooks infuriating and lovable as Petes mooch of a dad; the stark contrast between loquacious Larry and Debbies distant politely Waspish dad (a fine John Lithgow) feels a bit tidy but the performances are so good it scarcely matters. Apatows daughters acting for a third time opposite real-life mother Mann acquit themselves well with Maude in particular navigating one high-pitched adolescent tirade after another. A prominent role given to singer-songwriter Graham Parker cast as one of Petes clients supplies texture and detail as well as a handful of songs to go with the soundtracks more ubiquitous pop selections. D.p. Phedon Papamichaels crisp compositions show off the family homestead (nicely outfitted by production designer Jefferson Sage) and Los Angeles locations to warm inviting effect. Brent White and Jay Deubys editing has a sharp sense of comic timing and pacing although at 134 minutes the film is like many of Apatows pics long for a comedy; scenes featuring an unnecessarily creepy Charlyne Yi and too many semi-dated references to Sadies obsession with ABCs ""Lost"" could easily have been excised. But the rambling affectionate sprawl of ""This Is 40"" is entirely in keeping with Apatows irresistible philosophy that such messiness being a part of life should also be a part of movies.

TWITTER Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann star in director Judd Apatows ""west-of-the-405"" comedy. Judd Apatows new big-studio home movie is a two-hour wobble between the honestly funny and the downright unbearable. Truth be told there is more thats hard to take in the first half and more hilarity in the second which is a good thing but it remains unclear whether the filmmaker would recognize the difference between the two. Using the three female members of his immediate family in leading roles opposite Paul Rudd as his alter ego the most productive comic filmmaker of the past several years serves up a goulash of autobiography confessional self-psychoanalysis marriage counseling midlife angst anatomical pranks well-oiled shtick and far too many scenes that calculatedly end with obscene kickers. Even with all its ups and downs there are more than enough bawdy laughs and truthful emotional moments to put this over as a mainstream audience pleaser during a holiday season short on good comedies. VIDEO This Is 40 Trailer Delivers Sex Talk Constipation and Middle Aged Frustration Part of the problem going in is that This Is 40 is a member of the mini-genre of west-of-the-405 movies. This wont mean much to people who dont live in Los Angeles but such films -- arguably launched by James L. Brooks insufferable Spanglish in 2004 -- examine a species of people (many of them in the upper realms of show business) who live in a bubble of extreme affluence in the Brentwood vicinity and seem to devote all their time to their appearance diet exercise regimens status and neuroses without exhibiting any regard for or awareness of the outside world. Such people are a breed apart ripe for derision and satire but due little sympathy from the general public. Fitting all of these qualifications is the attractive family of Pete (Rudd) wife Debbie (Apatows wife Leslie Mann) and daughters Sadie and Charlotte (the Apatows real daughters Maude and Iris) wherein the parents almost invariably are at each others throats and the girls are forever yelling and complaining. Its also midlife-crisis time First Debbie and then Pete are turning 40 in the same week though Debbie dives into denial by having her cake topped by a ""38"" and later even lies to her doctors about her age. VIDEO THRs Oscar Roundtable 6 Writers Tell All in Uncensored Interview Under her husbands direction Mann who played the same role opposite Rudd in Knocked Up five years ago walks a very fine line between being unafraid to expose her characters flaws and being so impossible you want to scream. During the films initial stages its much more the latter as Debbies therapeutic mind-set touchy-feely instincts and control-freak behavior make for a toxic brew. Fortunately as the characterization deepens through the second half and Debbies flaws are outweighed by her willingness to adapt and try on new attitudes you begin to appreciate how game Mann is to lay it all out as she does; after all how many actresses have been willing to be shown undergoing a mammogram or assessing her husbands hemorrhoids? That said the way Apatow loads up the early going with gross sexual gags perhaps reveals a certain anxiety about his shifting gears from outright comedy to more observational humor; he seems to want to nail the laughs to reassert his standing as an outrageous comic talent before wading into the trickier waters of emotional and psychological nuance and insight. The fuller rewards of the film show up eventually but it takes time. With all their angst about aging and their frequent queries about whether they can stand each other any longer Petes and Debbies big largely unacknowledged problem is that theyve been living beyond their means and things are only getting worse. Pete runs a record label now overly devoted to old guys whose new work doesnt sell (Graham Parker gracefully appears as himself in this context) he and Debbie own a local boutique plagued by salesgirls (Megan Fox and Charlyne Yi both very amusing) who might be robbing them blind and Pete siphons money every month to his mooching dad (Albert Brooks) who has a much younger wife and three identical little towheaded sons. VIDEO Judd Apatow on Casting His Daughters in This Is 40 It occurs to Pete to sell the house -- which given its size and the neighborhood probably could sell for at least 4 million or 5 million -- but he cant bring himself to propose this to his status-conscious perfectionist wife. In other words its not too easy to feel sorry for them. Instead Pete withdraws to the john several times a day where Debbie thinks nothing of interrupting him; to manic bicycling; and into 70s music his real love. ""Why is your instinct to escape?"" Debbie barges in to ask while hes sitting on the crapper rivaling the stridency of Tea Leonis character in Spanglish which could have been set on the next street over. Apatow hasnt supplied what could be called a strong plot for This Is 40 but there is a sufficient structure to keep it upright especially as it all leads to an extended 40th birthday party for Pete that caps the film in excellent fashion. Very amusingly most of the films tensions and conflicts get flung right out in the open during this well-orchestrated sequence Debbies nonexistent relationship with her straight-arrow biological father (an excellent John Lithgow); Petes dads simmering sense of inferiority and resentment; the kids assorted emotional and hormonal issues; the competition between two guys (Jason Segel and Chris ODowd) over the attentions of Foxs naughty girl; and most of all of course a final airing of remaining lurking issues between Pete and Debbie. The smart manner in which all of this is pulled together and at least momentarily resolved goes a long way toward making up for all the mud and gum Apatow gets on his shoes in the first half. Theres not a weak or false note struck by the cast as everyone (including his family of course as well as Apatow-world regulars and newcomers including Brooks Lithgow Fox and Melissa McCarthy) gets on the live-wire wavelength. McCarthy only has two big scenes but both are classic the second funnier than the first. Under no circumstances should anyone leave before the end credits as McCarthys extended riff from her second scene is perhaps the most hilarious-ever example of an outtake included in a final roll-up since the practice began. It leaves you with an exceptionally good taste in your mouth even if youd been tempted to send the meal back two hours earlier.

It is overblown and unwieldy and has more than its share of misfires. It also has moments of absolute perfection that will have a universal and timeless resonance. Most importantly it is a pure maximalist representation of a gifted artist simultaneously at the top of his game and looking to expand the form. The form lets face it is the sitcom. Most of ""This is 40""s gargantuan running time is spent at the very upper-middle class (and product placement-heavy) home of Pete (a troubled record executive) and Debbie Sadie and Charlotte played if you didnt know by Apatows wife and daughters. Here they keep their spirits up with arguments that range from light ribbing to harmful accusations. Even when things get rough youll still be laughing. ""This is 40"" has a twin arsenal of extremely clever writing and gifted comic performers. When the two fire at once look out. The problem with ""This is 40"" and there is indeed one is the low to no stakes in the film. Try as I might I couldnt get too worked about the looming secret crisis - that the family might have to sell their house. When Rudds dark moment comes - sobbing in his BMW - I knew for sure that Apatow had gone way off the rails of crafting characters for outside of his own elite set or those so addicted to reality television that they project the problems absurd wealth onto their own lives. However - and this is key - it doesnt really matter. Its Apatows life and its his film. Write what you know you know? To that end I cant applaud the seemingly distasteful casting nepotism enough. When Julie Delpy casts her parents in her films it is charming. When have we ever seen this in something so mainstream and commercial? The results crackle on the screen. If we didnt know the behind-the-scenes story wed still notice the very striking personal nature of these relationships. The younger daughter doing a goofy dance for the older daughter is the type of thing a father notices about his kids and it never makes it into the movie except for in a one-of-a-kind scenario like this. With a film so light on plot (""our leads are 40 so now they think about being 40 plus business is bad"" is the closest thing to a logline) the big question for me is... why stop at 134 minutes? Trust me youll feel like youve lived in that house for a month. From my notebook at the 98 mark ""I cant believe this movie is still going."" There are many scenes in ""This is 40"" that land with a thud - the Jason Segel bits the pop culture referencing (although the ""Mad Men"" zing kills) and the curiously racist gags at the Indian doctor (made all the worse that he is the only person of color in the entire film) - so one has to wonder what got left out? Were already immersed may as well keep going. Theres an underlying arc of brighter horizons - we open with Rudd confessing to a friend how he fantasizes about his wifes death; we conclude by hugging it out with ultimate schnorrer  Albert Brooks - but most of ""This is 40"" is free form. Side characters waft in as we take little trips to schools or hotels or Petes office or Debbies boutique. I believe this is wholly intentional. Apatow is purposely saying to hell with the hackneyed devices that bog down so many mainstream comedies. Hes saying that his way of experiencing and observing the minor inconveniences of life are hilarious and by and large hes right. I simply wish the conflicts roiling his characters werent quite so worthy of an oh get over yourself ""You are bummed you are 40? Move to the Congo and your odds of not making it to 40 just increased a great deal you whiney ingrate"" youll be forgiven for thinking until Paul Rudd delivers a reaction shot that would make Jack Benny jealous. By sheer force of will ""This is 40"" is an emotional workout. Apatows blood in on every frame. Every viagra joke and mammogram gag. Every setup for Albert Brooks to deliver a shtetl-ready punchline that brings the house down in what might be the best performance of his career. Nevertheless the barb ""This is 40 Minutes Too Long"" still stands.
