Even as the movies archvillain (voice of James Woods) is hatching a plot that will lead to winter weather during summer vacations the soundtrack is pumping in Steppenwolfs Born to Be Wild (once the rallying anthem in Easy Rider) and the Strawberry Alarm Clocks Incense and Peppermint. Read more Stories Here comes the Recess gang budgeted for the big screen Beyond this Recess Schools Out ( out of four) more sympathetic authority figure (Dabney Colemans Principal Prickly) still has a peace symbol necklace hidden in his desk. Its a remnant from as explained in a flashback full of Peter Max-like color schemes the days when his archrival (Woods ) was establishing the anti-vacation credentials that would get him hired then fired as Secretary of Education. Saving the planet from high tides and glaciers is the constantly in-trouble T.J. Detwiler a fourth-grade grad who recruits an army of boy/girl buddies for backup. The result is passably speedy on the level of other TV retreads that seem miscast on the big screen. Still for parents who covet G ratings theres only one truly scary moment and it will traumatize only adults who stay through the end-credits musical sequence a Robert Goulet spin on Green Tambourine.

Publicity Photo William Eadie in ""Ratcatcher."" Publicity Photo FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Recess Schools Out Animated comedy. With voices by Dabney Coleman James Woods Andy Lawrence and April Winchell. Directed by Chuck Sheetz. (G. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The new childrens animated feature ""Schools Out"" begins with the Three Dog Night version of Harry Nilsson s hollowed-out lament ""One"" -- as in ""the loneliest number that you could ever do."" Dude why so sad? This big-screen episode of the ABC Saturday morning series ""Recess"" is a Disney joint meaning its an affair for all your children -- biological adopted or inner. Its fun its kind of somber and it succeeds in making you think about how you might be squandering middle age. Its the brainchild of Paul Germain and Joe Ansolabehere dads of the far more comprehensively tart and grotesque ""Rugrats."" The story -- in which mischievous young TJ and his camp-bound schoolmates fight to foil Dr. Philliam Benedicts goofy astrophysics plan to eliminate recess then summer vacation -- ought to pack a visceral kick for amusement-seeking third-graders. But what about that side plot starring hunchback Principal Prickles (voiced with heartbreaking exhaustion by Dabney Coleman) the one where he reflects fondly on a free-love yesteryear where he and Benedict (James Woods) were Third Street teachers with kaleidoscope eyes? The period nuances of course are meant for Mom and Dad -- or Gramps and Granny. ""Schools Out"" doesnt fish for satire though. The film is thin on laughs but its redolent of something funnier and altogether more unusual in the kid-flick climate unmitigated sincerity. Visually the film is a chortle factory. The whole thing with its crisp geometrically askew cast looks like ""School House Rocks"" or Robert Smigels ""TV Funhouse."" And for anyone who demands that his animated escapades close with ""far out"" generation-bridging kitsch theres Robert Goulet golden-throating his way through a version of ""Green Tambourine."" -- Wesley Morris RATCATCHER Drama. Starring William Eadie and Leanne Mullen. Directed by Lynne Ramsay. (Not rated. 105 minutes. In English with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Ratcatcher"" is about a very miserable childhood in Glasgow which is something like miserable childhoods elsewhere only here the people talk funny. Indeed the accents are so thick in this picture that its subtitled -- and those subtitles are indispensable. William Eadie a 12-year-old with a soulful face plays James a boy with bad luck. One day he is a horsing around by a canal with a playmate when the friend accidentally drowns. ""Ratcatcher"" starts off depressing; then it moves on to despairing and ends up seeming like a conspiracy to make viewers suicidal. Yet writer-director Lynne Ramsay has an artistic purity thats as penetrating as her young protagonists gaze. Her tableaus -- for example a shot of two kids sitting on a couch -- sneak into the unconscious and work on the emotions for reasons that are impossible to explain. There is something ineffably deep and true in Ramsays understanding of this Glasgow world which comes through powerfully in her compositions. Poverty emerges in ""Ratcatcher"" as not merely mirthless but also grotesque and even disfiguring. The adults look beaten while the kids look fresh but puzzled like calves who hear the screams from the slaughterhouse. Unfortunately ""Ratcatcher"" is better contemplated than experienced. The piling on of horrors becomes too unrelenting James girlfriend (Leanne Mullen) is gang-raped. Daddy is beaten up by toughs. Mommy is slapped by Daddy. And when its not awful its dull. Still Ramsay has something and with a better story -- perhaps someone elses -- she just might be magical. -- Mick LaSalle Advisory This film contains rough language nudity and violence.

""Recess Schools Out"" looks exactly like what it is a bigscreen version of a TV show. This spinoff of ""Disneys Recess"" naturally will generate some initial biz based on the small-fry following for the highly rated ABC Saturday morning series but it should be expected to follow in the forgettable footsteps of the studios previous TV-to-feature transfer ""Dougs 1st Movie"" which generated a worldwide gross of just 22.8 million two years back. A lucrative playdate awaits on homevid. Produced by Walt Disney Television this innocuous item about a group of playground pals who thwart the evil-doings of a megalomaniacal educator reps from a theatrical p.o.v. a degradation of the Disney name. What decades of careful brand-name nurturing have led the public to expect -- accomplished animation and original music for starters -- is tossed aside here in favor of utterly flat backgrounds a minimum of character detailing and a banal greatest-hits selection of late-60s rock songs. Moppets already keyed into the personalities of the six fourth-graders from Third Street School will slide right into this story of how the kids play spies during summer vacation. Distraught over his friends departure for various camps plucky T.J. begins noticing weird green light beaming out of the school building. Natch adults laugh off his claims but when he convinces Principal Prickly to take a look the latter is mysteriously vaporized prompting T.J. to reassemble his crew sneak into the school and ultimately save the nations children from a life of eternal recess deprivation. It wont be spoiling things for anyone to reveal that the roots of the evil here lie back in the heyday of hippiedom when young Prickly squashed the plans of ultra-cool rival educator Benedict to eradicate recess from the school day at Third Street School. Its taken three decades but Benedict now a national figure has finally figured out how to extract revenge Place a giant laser under a retractable roof at the school and beam it at the moon to alter its orbit thereby obliterating summer from the calendar and obviating the need for vacation. Maybe it will make sense to 5-year-olds. The laser is cool anyway. Animation is dull and characterless and vocal talent has evidently received blanket direction to when in doubt shout. Puzzling musical motif of 30-year-old tunes by the likes of Three Dog Night Strawberry Alarm Clock and the 5th Dimension is capped visually by a ""psychedelic"" sequence of a rock band playing ""Green Tambourine.""

(Disney) That television look is all over ""Recess Schools Out."" You know what I mean? With its almost cave-painting-simple drawings and less than completely fluid animation (that stuff costs money) this Walt Disney animated feature looks like well what it is a feature-length version of the popular childrens TV show ""Disneys Recess."" But dont let that stop you. The movies great fun particularly for kids used to that satirically hard-edged kind of kid show stuff like ""Rugrats."" Although the movies rated G its not really for the younger ""Barney"" crowd. This is about life during schooltime that veritable war between students desire to have as much fun as possible and teachers desire to make em learn. Schools finally out - yay - and 10-year-old T.J. Detweiler (voice of Andy Lawrence) is excited about the coming summer. That is until he finds out all his pals are going to various camps. Hes going to be all alone Fate intervenes when T.J. witnesses some strange goings-on at the empty school. It seems Benedict (voice of James Woods) an unscrupulous former principal of T.J.s elementary school intends to build a laser with a globally destructive agenda. By altering the moons cycles he plans to make a permanent winter which would end summers (and summer vacations). Kids would have to go to school all year round. And then test scores - something hes obsessed with improving at any cost - would really improve. Hmm sounds vaguely political to me. When T.J. alerts Principal Prickly (Dabney Coleman) the principal goes to investigate only to be apparently vaporized by the green glow in the school. Since no one else believes his story T.J. persuades his friends Vince (Rickey DShon Collins) Mikey (Jason Davis) Gretchen (Ashley Johnson) Gus (Courtland Mead) and Spinelli (Pam Segall) to help him get to the bottom of this mystery. They have to moonlight from their respective summer camps to do it. But they soon realize this is what funs all about staying in the neighborhood with their friends getting into mischief and saving summer for the world. Created and produced by Paul Germain (a co-creator of ""Rugrats"") and Joe Ansolabehere (a k a Paul amp; Joe) the movies very amusing. Coleman and Woods make colorful rivals as Prickly and Benedict; seems there was bad blood between them years ago. And there are a ton of things to tickle kids and grown-ups alike including T.J.s low-tech voice-altering prank to make him sound like Principal Prickly over the school intercom and such characters as the tough-talking no-nonsense Ms. Finster (April Winchell). And like ""Rugrats"" the movie doesnt mess around when it comes to kids. It doesnt talk down to them or soften things up. It just lays things on the line aware of the things that amuse the young and the old. Kids - and their chaperones - are going to appreciate that. ""Recess Schools Out"" (G 84 minutes) Contains scary goons in uniform.
