City Island Good Director Raymond De Felitta. Cast Andy Garcia Julianna Margulies Steven Strait. Rating PG-13 for sexual content smoking and language. Note At Harkins Camelview. RELATED Qamp;A Andy Garcia Or so they believe. Turns out that despite what they may think no one not even his family really knows much at all about Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia). There probably are some things even Vince doesnt know about himself. And there certainly are some things he doesnt know about his wife and kids. Thats at the heart of ""City Island"" a funny heartfelt look at families relationships and the lies that prop them up as much as tear them down. Vince is a correctional officer - dont call him a prison guard even though thats what he is - sneaking smokes on the side. Thats OK so is his wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies). Their daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido Garcias real-life daughter) has her own secret as does their son Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller) neither of which does much for the story. But theres more. Vince attends a regular poker game. Joyce is certain Vince is lying to her that the game is a ruse to hide an affair with another woman. Shes half right; its actually Vinces excuse to go into the city for acting classes. Yes. In this world becoming an actor is even lower than being an adulterer. Meanwhile Vince runs across a young man whos about to be released but has nowhere to go. Tony (Steven Strait) looks familiar to Vince as well he should Hes his son whom Vince has never met from a long-ago fling. Wracked by guilt Vince brings Tony to live with his family in a shed out back. (He doesnt bother to ask Joyce with predictable results.) It serves as a sort of observational perch where Tony can watch the familys lies unravel as they must. Vince befriends his acting-class partner Molly (Emily Mortimer) who has secrets of her own; its evidently a prerequisite for being in the movie. Hes able to confide in her ostensibly as part of an acting exercise but more because she knows his secrets and hes comfortable in a way hes not with Joyce. That doesnt mean its a romance and it doesnt mean Vince doesnt love Joyce. He does very much. They relate to each other in a hotheaded but genuine way; yelling is as much a part of their household as Joyces dinners. In some families a smooth surface belies turmoil below. With Vince and Joyce the opposite is true. They yell they argue and yet they wouldnt know what to do without each other. True they fudge some details of their lives but theyre capable of learning from their mistakes. At least thats how writer and director Raymond De Felitta tells it and hes helped immensely by Garcia and Margulies who have a natural chemistry perfect for this sort of thing. Actors playing actors often run into trouble but Garcias bit as Vince trying a Marlon Brando impersonation during an audition for a film is priceless. Garcias quite good throughout as a man who has made mistakes and is finally coming face-to-face with them. He goes about it in a rather inelegant way but hes the kind of character whos so appealing in films He just keeps plodding along wading through the messes he has made capable of surprising people - maybe even himself.

Steven Strait from left Dominik Garcia-Lorido Andy Garcia Julianna Margulies and Ezra Mille play a Bronx Italian family in City Island. Photo Phil V. Caruso AP City Island 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Dysfunctional movie families like iPods or guitar amps come with a variable volume control. At one end of the knob are the quiet folks the highly privileged but emotionally constipated upper-middle-class. At the other end the big screaming New York working-class broods outer-borough ethnics who deep down love each other like mad. City Islandfalls into the second category. And how. Youd be hard put to find a movie in current release with more characters yelling more loudly and more often than the totally bananas Bronx Italians in this noisy eccentric bizarrely lovable film. Begin by quadrupling the idiosyncrasy inMoonstruck. Then move the setting out of Brooklyn onto a picturesque spit of land previously featured inLong Days Journey Into Nightand (briefly)A Bronx Tale. Now fill it with a bunch of total flakes Vince a Brando-obsessed corrections officer (Andy Garcia); Joyce his angry wife (Julianna Margolies); Vivian his stripper-daughter (Dominik Garcia-Lorido); Tony his illegitimate convict son (Steven Strait); and Vinnie his snarky teenager with a mostly benign obesity fetish (Ezra Miller). As if that isnt nutty enough theyre all keeping secrets from each other. No one knows about Vivians pole-dancing or Vinces acting class or Vinnies furtive thing for feeding heavy ladies. No one but Vince knows that Tonys his son -- not even Tony. Yeesh. Who are these people? Or as Tony yells in a moment of earsplitting dramatic catharsis ""Youre all so sick"" Written and directed by Raymond De Felitta (Two Family House) City Island seems devoted at first to the sort of quirkalicious comic melodrama that can turn unpalatable fast. I watched with a large knot of dread in my stomach. (Oh no X is going to happen. Oh no Y is going to happen. Oh no ...) But then a miracle occurs. The script defies expectation. Every device that seemed awful and doomed to failure becomes a cause for hilarity and joy all of it romanticized in Vanja Cernjuls twinkling cinematography. The cast proves game for anything from Emily Mortimer as Vinces floridly English acting-class partner to a beleaguered bewhiskered Strait here displaying a comic prowess and fond knack for exasperation that somehow escaped my notice in 10000 B.C. As for Garcia -- what a charmer. He digs hard into a regional working-class character bit (like Mel Gibson in Edge of Darkness minus the savagery) and comes up with a fine sympathetic captivating turn as a humble man with enormous dreams. Just wait for the audition scene near the end; first youll laugh and then youll marvel. Full disclosure My father was a New York paesan. A loud one. As my mother often remarked ""This is why the Italians invented opera"" a mantra I recalled during City Islands more cacophonous scenes. But you neednt have colorful Italian relatives of your own to enjoy this boisterous and warm-hearted film which sidesteps cliche while embracing the hope and love in loony dysfunctional families everywhere. Theres no turning them down so you may as well crank em up full blast.

Starring Alan Arkin Steven Strait Emily Mortimer Andy Garcia Julianna Margulies Steven J. Klaszky Sharon Angela Chris Miskiewicz Dominik Garcia-Lorido George Aloi Director Raymond De Felitta Running time 140 Release Opened Apr 9 2010  Editorial Review Isolated in a sea of secretsBy John AndersonFriday April 9 2010The real City Island is a fishing village in the Bronx which makes it almost as unlikely as the characters who populate Raymond De Felittas dark-edged comedy. No man is an island? In this story everyone man or woman is a walled fortress of paranoia secrecy unsatisfied yearnings and anger-at-low-tide all of which will rise and collapse over the course of what is a very funny film and one that operates at the sea level of humanity. Quaint. Slightly peculiar.What seems to attract De Felitta as a writer-director is eccentricity and fractured urbanity; over the past two decades he has made a handful of charming films including the memorable ""Two Family House"" most of which deal with characters who cultivate anxieties and predispositions into full-blown catastrophes. Its no surprise therefore that native New Yorkers are De Felittas collective muse.Vince Rizzo (played by Andy Garcia who also produced) is a corrections officer wannabe actor and beleaguered husband. Domestic relations being what they are he tells his wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies looking as hard as press-on nails) that hes going out to play poker rather than admit hes taking an acting class. For her part Joyce is the personification of matrimonial displeasure With a hair-trigger temper and an adversarial relationship with cosmetics she puts all her hopes and dreams into her college-student daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) who unbeknownst to any other Rizzo has dropped out of school and is working as a stripper.Not enough? The Rizzos acerbic son Vince Jr. (the hilarious Ezra Miller) provides a sarcastic Greek chorus to his familys inanity while running his own clandestine operation After spying on his rather large neighbor Denise (Carrie Baker Reynolds) he learns to his delight that she has a chubby-chaser Web site. Hes in heaven. But even Vince Jr.s fatty fetish pales in comparison with the baggage that Dads towing around a son he has never met named Tony (Steven Strait) who has just become a guest of the state inside Vinces place of employment.Garcia is quite moving as Vince whos barely in the acting game; his teacher (Alan Arkin) is cynical enough to deflate any aspiring thespian. But he goes on a fateful casting call because one enthusiastic classmate Molly (Emily Mortimer) neutralizes his innate pessimism. The Molly-Vince equation is refreshing a romance-free relationship thats about sharing ones secret self. But all the Rizzos have the same problem. One of the amazing things about ""City Island"" is the realization -- during its small-caliber apocalypse/climax -- of just how many enormous secrets are being harbored by so few people. A stripper. An illegitimate son. Forbidden lust. Illicit smoking. Its enough for a whole season of ""All My Children"" without the bad acting.The acting is in fact superb and given the amount of drama per frame the best current buy for ones movie dollar.Anderson is a freelance reviewer.Contains vulgarity adult content and lots of smoking.

ABOUT THE MOVIECity Island   out of four Stars Andy Garcia Julianna Margulies Alan Arkin Emily Mortimer Steven StraitDirector Raymond De FelittaDistributor Anchor Bay FilmsRating PG-13 for sexual content smoking and languageRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesExpands to select cities nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Well-guarded secrets and white lies form the busiest intersection in City Island. This slight and farcical dysfunctional family comedy has unexpected charms tapping into basic truths about human nature and familial relationships. The ensemble cast is strong. At its silliest comic moments it has a sitcom flavor but the overall effect is gently amusing. CITY ISLAND Watch the trailer Prison guard Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) knows something about keeping things close to the vest. His private dream is to act but no one in his boisterous family has any idea. Theyre caught up in their own deceptions. Vince sneaks off to acting classes pretending hes playing poker. His hot-tempered wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies) thinks hes having an affair. Meanwhile shes keeping her smoking habit a secret from the family. Their children a socially awkward teenage Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller) and college-student daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido Garcias real-life daughter) have their own covert concerns. The one involving teenage Vince is the weakest link in the story. Credulity is stretched by his youthful fetish for obese women. Its neither believable nor funny but Millers overall comic timing is sharp. And his snarky quips about his voluble Italian-American family shouting it up at the dinner table elicit some of the films biggest laughs. Complicating matters further is the arrival of Tony a young inmate (Steven Strait) who has nowhere to go after his release. Vince offers him a place to stay in exchange for carpentry work. The strapping Tonys appearance leads to a flurry of unexpected events particularly involving the women in the family. Suddenly their predictable life in City Island a little-known patch of the Bronx thats also a fishing village turns chaotic. Alan Arkin is charming as Vinces wry drama coach. Emily Mortimer a wonderfully subtle actress is hamstrung by her vague role as another aspiring actor. But her easy chemistry with the robust Garcia is enjoyable to watch. In fact all the performances are warmly engaging even though the characters are broad and scenarios occasionally extreme. For those tired of clashing titans or weepy teen romances City Island is a breath of fresh air.

(L to R) Julianna Margulies and Andy Garcia star in Anchor Bay FilmsO CITY ISLAND. Photo Phil Caruso Review City Island loud but loving 1 / 1 Back to Gallery City Island Dramedy. Directed by Raymond De Felitta. Starring Andy Garcia and Julianna Margulies. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""City Island"" is one of those movies about big screaming New York working-class broods who deep down love each other like mad. Youd be hard put to find a movie in current release with more characters yelling more loudly and more often than the totally bananas Bronx Italians in this noisy eccentric bizarrely lovable film. Begin by quadrupling the idiosyncrasy in ""Moonstruck."" Then move the setting out of Brooklyn onto a picturesque spit of land previously featured in ""Long Days Journey into Night"" and (briefly) ""A Bronx Tale."" Now fill it with a bunch of total flakes Vince a Brando-obsessed corrections officer (Andy Garcia); Joyce his angry wife (Julianna Margulies); Vivian his stripper-daughter (Dominik Garcia-Lorido); Tony his illegitimate convict-son (Steven Strait); and Vinnie his snarky teenage son with a mostly benign obesity fetish (Ezra Miller). As if that isnt nutty enough theyre all keeping secrets from each other. No one knows about Vivians pole-dancing or Vinces acting class or Vinnies furtive thing for feeding heavy ladies. Written and directed by Raymond De Felitta ""City Island"" seems devoted at first to the sort of quirkalicious comic melodrama that can turn unpalatable fast. But then something special occurs The script defies expectation. Every device that seemed awful and doomed to failure becomes a cause for hilarity and joy all of it romanticized in Vanja Cernjuls twinkling cinematography. The cast proves game for anything from Emily Mortimer as Vinces floridly English acting-class partner to a beleaguered bewhiskered Strait here displaying a comic prowess and fond knack for exasperation. As for Garcia he digs hard into a regional working-class character bit and comes up with a fine sympathetic captivating turn as a humble man with enormous dreams. You neednt have colorful Italian relatives like myself to enjoy this boisterous and warm-hearted film which sidesteps cliche while embracing the hope and love in loony dysfunctional families everywhere.

(Corkery/News) BY Joe Neumaier Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITICS Thursday March 18 2010 1119 PM City Island3 starsComedy about a Bronx family. At the Angelika (140). PG-13 Sexuality language.Raymond De Felitta really should have released his amiable romantic comedy over the summer because anyone who sees it will want to schedule a day trip to City Island immediately.This enchanting Bronx community provides the backdrop for all manner of misunderstandings among the Rizzo clan. Dad (Andy Garcia) is a prison guard who wants to act Mom (Julianna Margulies) has the wrong idea about his rehearsals with a fellow student (Emily Mortimer) and their kids are hiding some serious secrets.The performances are absurdly broad and each story line is more outlandish than the last. But De Felittas approach is so easygoing and the waterside setting so irresistibly charming youre bound to walk out in a great mood. How many movies can do that for you?Elizabeth WeitzmanNeil Young Trunk Show 5 starsConcert film starring Neil Young. At the Sunshine (123). Not rated.In a way it must be hard for music fans in Upper Darby Pa. to see the release of Jonathan Demme?agt;??s vivid concert film on Neil Young -- the second of three planned collaborations. After all that lucky Pennsylvania audience was privy to a unique experience and now the world gets to share it. Not only that but Demme beautifully captures the shows casual intimacy which allows viewers to feel like Young is singing directly to them.The title represents the notion of a traveling act as if Young were pulling things at random from an old case. So gorgeous rarities like ""Kansas"" tumble out alongside classics such as ""Cinnamon Girl"" or ""Like a Hurricane."" And if he has overlooked your favorites have faith Theres plenty left in the trunk for that promised encore.Elizabeth WeitzmanVincere 3 starsDrama about Benito Mussolinis first wife and child. At Lincoln Plaza and IFC Center (208). Not rated Sexuality. In Italian with English subtitles.A gorgeous-looking historical drama that depicts the early days of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini (Filippo Timi) and his secret marriage to Ida Dalser (Giovanna Mezzogiorno). As the future Il Duce rises among the countrys socialists he leaves Dalser and their young child and starts another family relegating Dalser to an asylum where her claims of being married to Mussolini are seen as insanity -- a fate her son will share.Director Marco Bellocchio?agt;??s drama assuredly shifts focus once the National Fascist Party forms but cant wring much drama after Dalsers story is set. Still theres visual poetry here and haunted performances from Mezzogiorno and Timi -- who plays two roles and is especially gripping as Dalsers grown son.Joe NeumaierThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo3 starsThriller about a pair of amateur detectives. At area theaters (232). Not rated Extreme violence language sexuality. In Swedish with subtitles.The original title of this suspenseful Swedish smash was ""Men Who Hate Women"" which is much more apt. Dont worry though -- the women get their own back. Or at least Lisbeth does. Played by Noomi Rapace shes a rebellious hacker whos earned the chip on her shoulder. When she breaks into the account of a famous reporter (Michael Nyqvist) on the trail of a misogynous serial killer its clear he needs her help.The mismatched leads make a compelling pair and director Niels Arden Oplev keeps the action relatively tight. But he revels in the storys sadism to an uncomfortable degree especially in a needlessly vile rape scene. Two more sequels are coming. Heres hoping theres just a little less hate in each.Elizabeth WeitzmanDiary of a Wimpy Kid2.5 starsA middle-schooler deals with a less-than-fun life. At area theaters (130). PG Gross-out humor.Based on the kids book series (and borrowing some of its goofy line drawings) this year-in-the-life comedy will appeal mostly to its target audience -- the boys of middle school USA -- and frankly thats all it needs. Who else would appreciate the idiocy of social pressure the prevalence of bullies the torment of friendships that are exhausting but still important? Okay amend that The themes are universal. Its the hyperactive gross-out delivery that will strike the caffeinated nerves of 10- to 13-year-olds best. The young cast is all game and sidekicks Robert Capron and Grayson Russell are a real hoot. Slumber party viewings are inevitable.Joe Neumaier Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

But the Bronx of ""City Island"" is a world apart. The films namesake is the tiny fishing village on the outskirts of the New York borough. Inhabitants are either ""mussel-suckers"" (new islanders) or ""clamdiggers"" (longtime natives) a distinction that Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) proudly announces in the movies opening narration. It may be a very specific locale but ""City Island"" is a broad comedy. Its a domestic farce where everyone in the Rizzo household harbors secrets hiding their smoking - and many other habits - from each other. Vince is a prison security guard (a ""correctional facilities officer"" he insists) married to a secretary Joyce (Julianna Margulies). Both are showing some wear from 20 years of marriage and creeping middle-age regrets. Their daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido Garcias real-life daughter too) is home from college on spring break but has - unbeknownst to her parents - lost her scholarship and taken up stripping to make money. Their son Vinnie Jr. (Ezra Miller) is a high school teenager in the midst of discovering his sexuality. Hes drawn to larger women and has a fetish for feeding them. (You know normal kid stuff.) Vince has two dark secrets. One he fathered a child before he was married that he never helped raise. Making his rounds at the prison he spots his son Tony (Steven Strait) who has grown into a felon and a hunk and paroles him to his home. Vinces more shameful secret is that lowliest sin of all He wants to be an actor. He discreetly soaks in Stanislavskis ""An Actor Prepares"" and sneaks out for acting classes while telling his wife hes going to play poker. Alan Arkin plays his exasperated drama teacher (tired of Brando impressions he asks his students for ""a moratorium on pauses""). Emily Mortimer is his more learned acting partner (she calls him ""Vincent"" quotes Ogden Nash and tells Vince to call her but ""only on a whim""). The many closeted skeletons all eventually come out in an operatic rush. The fallout is nearly disastrous (""Oh dear Greek in scope"" murmurs Mortimers character) which is enough to make the movies tidy ending almost sarcastic. New York writer-director Raymond De Felitta (""Two Family House"" ""The Thing About My Folks"") has made the messy comic interiors of family life a continual theme. In ""City Island"" he succeeds most in gathering a very entertaining ensemble and eliciting funny melodrama in particularly from Garcia (who also produced) and Margulies. Garcia who long ago emerged as another character named Vincent in ""The Godfather Part III"" shows an almost Alec Baldwin-like ability to use his dramatic panache for comic effect. Vince is charmingly clueless particularly in his quixotic audition for a bit part in a Martin Scorsese film. Margulies seething wife is equally fine. The set up all begs a little too obviously for indie quirk - it even has the reliably superior Arkin in a supporting role as if proof of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" ambitions. But the outer-borough oddities of ""City Island"" are hard to resist. ""City Island"" an Anchor Bay Films release is rated PG-13 for sexual content smoking and language. Running time 100 minutes.

Raymond de Felittas films have concerned themselves with families that form small enclaves of eccentricity in a sea of homey conservatism. Desperately trying to conform to neighborhood norms his characters hide their true selves until through determination or happenstance their otherness breaks through. In ""City Island"" set in the titular New York harbor community that breakthrough explodes in fireworks of farce spearheaded by Andy Garcias virtuoso perf as a prison guard with a loud abrasive secret-ridden brood. Another expertly written joyride through the confines of narrowminded provincialism to cleansing self-awareness from de Felitta this Tribeca audience award-winner could go mainstream. The first signs of danger to the familys precarious equilibrium arrive when jail guard Vince (Garcia) recognizes just-transferred inmate Tony Nardella (a hunky Steven Strait) as the son he sired and abandoned long before his marriage. Vince decides to parole Tony into his custody and brings him home without telling his family of the connection. Vince is already hiding another secret Hes enrolled in a Manhattan acting workshop his transparent alibi of going to a poker game leading wife Joyce (a magnificently temperamental Julianna Margulies) to suspect infidelity. Meanwhile Vinces daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcio-Lorido) is dancing in a strip joint to pay her college tuition while his younger son Vinnie (Ezra Miller in a pitch-perfect turn) harbors a sexual kink -- surfing the Internet in search of overweight women. To outsider Tony the only real secret is why the family members even bother concealing their problems and passions -- particularly since they literally cry out from the rooftop where Vince puffs away at the cigarettes he supposedly gave up. For Vince unhappy in his prison job but convinced of his intellectual limitations acting represents a dream vocation fueled by his affection for Marlon Brando films. Almost touchingly clueless he doesnt even realize the long hilarious tirade against Method acting delivered in high style by his embittered drama teacher (Alan Arkin) is leveled against idol Brando. Paired for a thesping exercise with sophisticated Brit Molly (Emily Mortimer) he confides his ambitions while she urges the reluctant Vince to try out for a Martin Scorsese film. Vinces audition complete with an incredibly bad mouth-stretching Brando imitation is a comic mini-masterpiece revealing hitherto unplumbed dese-dem-and-dose depths in the usually urbane Garcia. His domestic scenes with a volatile earthy Margulies (earlier paired with Garcia in ""The Man From Elysian Fields"") fairly sizzle with sexual frustration and blindsided affection. For de Felitta comedy is never cruel and following ones personal bents however unorthodox is always empowering. And if the staging of the pics hysterical campily melodramatic dockside finale registers as overly schematic with every skeleton in the closet systematically divulged it may be because his characters cling so tenaciously to their humanity. Through the lens of cinematographer Vanja Cernjul ""City Island"" does for the small off-urban district what de Felittas ""Two Family House"" did for Staten Island mapping it indelibly on the cinematic atlas. The locale often figured in earlier movies but always subbing for someplace else.

"City Island Bronx familys secrets - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 1/2 starsCity Island Bronx familys secretsApril 01 2010|By Glenn WhippRaymond De Felittas screwball farce ""City Island"" introduces us to the Rizzos a boisterous party of four living in the tradition-steeped seaside spit of Bronx real estate of the movies title. The Rizzos dont talk to one another much and when they do the neighbors undoubtedly hear every word. But deep down were meant to understand they shout because they care. The Rizzos also harbor secrets. Corrections officer Vince ( Andy Garcia) tells wife Joyce ( Julianna Margulies) that hes out playing poker when hes really taking acting classes in Manhattan. Joyce smokes cigarettes on the sly and nurses a grudge about the extramarital affair shes sure Vince is having. Daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido Garcias real-life daughter) strips to earn tuition money; teen son Vinnie (Ezra Miller) spies on an obese neighbor. When Vince discovers that an inmate at his prison is his long-lost son Tony (Steven Strait) he invites the soon-to-be ex-con to finish out his sentence by doing odd jobs around his house. This plot contrivance produces the expected howls of familial protest (and really the screamers do have a point) and topples the first domino for the rat-a-tat-tat revelation of all the hidden lies. No the movies setup would barely pass muster on ""Threes Company"" and theres little doubt that the whole thing is going to end in a group hug. But ""City Island"" scrapes by and delivers a smile or two because it does contain a fundamental understanding of the rot that sets in when people hide their true selves from the ones they love. De Felitta (""Two Family House"") gives all his actors plenty of room to roam. Garcia afforded the chance to stretch his comic muscles and play a working stiff comes off best nailing Vinces good-natured vulnerability. When Vince catches a break and lands an audition for a Martin Scorsese mob movie Garcia delivers a nerve-jangling tour de force tryout that will be appreciated by out-of-work actors for years to come. And yes some shouting is involved.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The heart sinks within the first few seconds of City Island as prison guard Andy Garcias prolix narration wafts over footage of him doing his daily rounds. ""You asked me about my secret"" he says. ""My most personal secret. The secret of all my secrets."" Did we? On second thought skip it. Garcias not the only one with something to hide on City Island a tiny water-rimmed outpost of the Bronx that manages to cram enough secrets for a weeks worth of Days Of Our Lives into its single square mile. His sitcom-surly son (Ezra Miller) is a fetishist with a thing for feeding obese women; his daughter (Dominik Garcia-Lorido Garcias real-life daughter) is working as a stripper after losing her college scholarship. Garcia himself has two hes a Brando obsessive whos been sneaking off to acting class when he tells his wife (Julianna Marguiles) hes playing poker and he has an illegitimate son (Steven Strait) whos just landed on his cell block for grand theft auto. Thats a lot of balls to keep in the air and writer-director Raymond De Felitta (Two Family House) doesnt have anything like the dexterity to keep them moving. The farce plods where it should zip and the performances are as thudding as his direction. Garcia and Marguiles bite down on their accents as if gnawing on a particularly tenacious soft pretzel conducting every conversation at an elevated decibel level so that theres nowhere to go once theres actually something to shout about. Garcias acting teacher (Alan Arkin) inveighs against the post-Method style of pause-riddled acting but the nonstop clangor of City Island is hardly the needed corrective. Every once in a while the din subsides long enough for a well-turned line or a choice observation to make itself heard. But the movie too often equates drama with volume and agita with authenticity.

By David Denby Edward Norton playing a double role as twin brothers with Richard Dreyfuss.   Credit Illustration by Victor Melamed Edward Norton is a good actor and a busy man--a citizen who concerns himself with solar energy affordable housing the Maasai wilderness peace in the Middle East the High Line the fate of the Mets outfield and heaven knows what else. But hes not quite a movie star or the actor he could be. Early on after a fast Oscar-nominated start as an altar boy accused of murdering a priest in ""Primal Fear"" (1996) Norton played cunning lowlifes in tough little pictures. He was brilliant as Lester (Worm) Murphy a reckless gambler and nihilist in ""Rounders"" (1998) and then muscling up he turned Derek Vinyard the swastikaed skinhead in ""American History X"" (also 1998) into a horrifyingly intelligent native fascist. Norton has blue eyes a long narrow chin and an ironic smile that can suddenly turn intimate. He can be retiring and nearly bodiless falling back from confrontation like a ghost; he can also be menacing and cold hardening his baritone into a snarl. Like James Woods in films thirty years ago he appears to think that hes the smartest person in the room and like Woods he uses that arrogance as a way of exposing the madness of egotistical characters. At the moment movies could use more men like Norton--actors who can spread a little acid or a little light. If such high-domed performers develop an ingratiating way with women they become stars like George Clooney; if not they usually subside into character roles like Woods or Alec Baldwin. Its not easy to be the smartest guy in the room. Norton I think has the charm the courage and the dimensions to take on great parts but his career has wandered around in roles that have been off center without being good. He stood up to Brad Pitts bullying in the nutty cult classic ""Fight Club"" (1999). He was the scientist with anger-management issues in ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008) the kind of popping-veins extravaganza every actor should gratefully leave to Jim Carrey. He was swanky in cravats high collars and an Anglo-Austrian accent in that thick wedge of Hapsburg cheesecake ""The Illusionist"" (2006). The accent got even more pinched and refined when he played a British doctor suppressing his personal sorrows and martyring himself to Chinese epidemics in ""The Painted Veil"" (2006) a frightfully noble picture that could have been made by M-G-M in 1940. These are not the best choices for an actor with an instinct for contemporary life. Action is apparently not to Nortons taste but hes a natural for calculating power types and intellectuals--gangsters lawyers politicians journalists corporate and financial operators. He needs to find writers who will create roles for him as intelligent troubled men as Clooney has. In ""Leaves of Grass"" Norton gets a real workout in a goosey half-serious half-comical mess. Hes Bill Kincaid a mesmerizing classical-philosophy professor at Brown. Hes also Bills identical twin Brady an Oklahoma pot grower with truck-stop manners and a peculiar drawl (peculiar because it runs at double tempo). Brady is everything that Bill left behind in his ascent to the Ivy League. Citing Socrates Bill tells his class that the Greeks knew that passion was ""mercilessly human"" that a serene life was an illusion. Yet hes a becalmed man himself--another asexual dried-up movie professor without a touch of spontaneity. As he considers an offer from Harvard (the film drops all the right names) he hears that Brady has been killed. This is a ruse it turns out to lure him back to Oklahoma where he gets pulled into his brothers convoluted plot to take on the drug kingpin of the Southwest (Richard Dreyfuss). As Bill Norton wears his hair short his sweaters sleeveless and his slacks gray; his style is academic casual. When he plays Brady his hair is long and stringy; hes loose-limbed and slack-jawed and he cant stop chattering. The surprise of the movie is that Brady the pot grower is just as smart as Bill the professor and a lot happier. He cultivates dope in mineral-water solutions--hes a hydroponic felon--and his weed packs a wallop. Norton gives himself to this reprobate without condescension. He turns Brady into a warmhearted enraging but lovable screwup. Norton has played double before--the nice boy in ""Primal Fear"" had a vicious side--but never in such a literal way. To adopt the movies classical terminology the Apollonian and the Dionysian temperaments are digitally joined in an agon. Tim Blake Nelson who wrote and directed ""Leaves of Grass"" combines the two Nortons in ways that look natural enough. They argue talking over each others words horse around and fight. The movie is a showcase for digital technology and for Nortons virtuosity but I wish it werent such a weightless shambles. Nelson cant seem to find the right tone; he veers from backwoods comedy to nervously unhinged violence to earnest talk of poetry and the meaning of life. Born Jewish in Tulsa (his maternal grandparents escaped the Nazis) Nelson has some heavy fun with his community. He makes Dreyfusss drug lord (who fronts as a businessman) a fierce Jewish supporter of Israel--his office walls are lined with pictures of Menachem Begin and other Israeli leaders. And Nelson throws in a foolish Jewish orthodontist (Josh Pais) who tries to blackmail both brothers and accidentally kills someone. Theres no reason that Jews shouldnt be treated as comically as anyone else in the movies but the scenes are so crudely directed that theyre more embarrassing than funny. Recitations of Walt Whitman and a few encounters with a lovely teacher and poet (Keri Russell) begin to quicken the professor but the movie for all its high-culture flourishes feels stale. The mix of cornpone shenanigans and intellectualism lands Nelson in Coen Brothers territory and I never thought that Id miss their brutally mocking tone so much. Edward Norton needs to put himself not only in the hands of a good writer but of a good director too. After brilliant early performances as a sardonic tough in ""8 Million Ways to Die"" (1986) and ""Godfather III"" (1990) Andy Garcia also ran into the rough. ""City Island"" an amiable family comedy one step above a TV sitcom (and several steps below ""Moonstruck"") wont put him back on the main road but he tries some new things in it and its fun to watch him work. Garcia is Vince Rizzo the stressed paterfamilias of an Italian-American clan living in the Bronx boating community a family in which everyone has a secret and mistrusts everyone else. (The story is kept going by the inability of any character to say even six words of truth in a row.) Vince is a prison guard whose secret is that he wants to perform at night he sneaks off to an acting class. In one scene the instructor played by Alan Arkin delivers a hilarious diatribe against ""the pause""--the endlessly prolonged reflective grimace that Marlon Brando introduced into American acting. Speak or listen the teacher says. Dont pause. The familys screaming fights may be glibly contrived (no pausing there) but the miseries of an aspiring actors life feel genuine. Vince auditions for a Scorsese movie and as he is interviewed by a female casting director perched on a platform he painfully casts away every acting mannerism until he speaks in his own voice. Vince comes to life and for that moment Garcia regains the energy he had as a young actor. If Norton and Garcia are good actors whose careers got lost Gerard Butler (""300"") is a brutish actor whose career should be confined to playing sword-bearing Spartans and perhaps wrestlers in the netherworld of cable. I want to meet the agent who sold Butler to the studios as a romantic-comedy star. (He was also in ""The Ugly Truth."") In ""The Bounty Hunter"" Butlers dark hair droops over his forehead and he looks like a cross between Cro-Magnon man and Moe from the Three Stooges. Butler is Scottish and you can see him trying to form American-sounding phrases with his lips but the voice comes out coarse-grained and weirdly nondescript as if produced by a badly programmed computer. His bounty hunter once a great cop takes on the job of reeling in his ex-wife a hustling New York crime reporter on the lam played by Jennifer Aniston in heels and skintight dresses. The queen of all celebrity magazines is still adorable and she has just enough technique--a mouth twisted in disbelief a furrowed brow--to get by as a comedienne. The movie is an example of the once sublime genre known as ""the comedy of re-marriage."" That is as the couple are tearing each other apart were meant to root for them to get back together. The only thing that Butler and Aniston have in common however is identical Aruba-bronze skin tones they seem to have been sprayed with the same can. Even considered as no more than an assembly-line Hollywood product ""The Bounty Hunter"" falls well below factory standards.

Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 26 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English City Island Written and directed by Raymond de Felitta Starring Andy Garcia Julianna Margulies Emily Mortimer Alan Arkin Steven Strait and Ezra Miller Classification PG You can imagine Bronx prison guard Vince Rizzo sidling in next to Archie Bunker on a New York bus piloted by Ralph Kramden. Like the stars of All in the Family and The Honeymooners Vince is a regular guy driven mad by the world. As with Archie and Ralph his wife is steering the car. Heres Vince (Andy Garcia) asking his temperamental spouse for a favour ""Make something special for dinner"" he smiles. ""Like for a special occasion. Something nice."" ""Want balloons or something?"" Joyce Rizzo (Julianna Margulies) frowns cutting food coupons from a magazine. ""Nah I dont want balloons or something. Im just saying something nice."" ""Dont I always make something nice?"" ""Make it nicer"" ""MAKE IT YOURSELF"" Vince wants a banquet because his prodigal son is returning. Tony this kid at the jail reminds him of someone. Vince soon realizes the inmate is his son from a teenage affair. (Maybe the boy reminds him of himself.) After a series of hard swallows Vince helps arrange the kids parole into his custody without explaining why. Hell figure out what to tell Tony and his sure-to-be-furious wife later. Hopefully much later. Spiralling Oedipal confusions ensue. Joyce suspects Vince is cheating on her. Hes been distant lately so in retaliation she begins flirting with her stepson; not that she knows the last part. Tony (Steven Strait) is some hunky prison labourer her cheapskate husband has brought in to do repairs Joyce figures. The 20-year-old visitor in turn is more interested in his half-sister who the family believes is away at college. Actually Vivian is a stripper. Wait there are more badly kept secrets more commotion Vince isnt stepping out on his wife. Turns out hes been cheating himself. The prison guard has always wanted to be an actor. Another Brando. Now with the aid of his kooky agent (Emily Mortimer) hes secretly auditioning for a Scorsese movie. Then theres Vince and Joyces other boy Vinnie (Ezra Miller very good) a sarcastic reed-thin high-school kid with a yen for lavishly overweight women. Yes its really complicated life with the Rizzos. City Island probably has too many moving parts. Still writer-director Raymond de Felitta ( Two Family House) understands that a proper farce like a good campfire needs plenty of friction to get started. He also loves testing good actors the way car enthusiasts enjoy tooling around in a well-engineered automobile. Garcia and Margulies have never been better. Their scenes together are funny and harrowing brimming with giddy danger.

You have the put-upon dad (Andy Garcia) the grouchy mom (Julianna Margulies) the eccentric teen son (Ezra Miller) and the stripper daughter (Dominik Garcia-Lorido). Wacky huh? Movie Information City IslandRatingShowtimes | Official site and trailerDirector Raymond De FelittaActors Andy Garcia Julianna Margulies Steven Strait Ezra Miller and Dominik Garcia-LoridoRun time 100 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (language sexual content)Synopsis Lies - and the revealed truth - turn a family upside down.More movies from GuideLive.comBut appearances can be deceiving and it doesnt take long for City Island named for and set in a hidden working-class paradise in the Bronx to win you over with its generosity of spirit. Yeah it cloys a little too much and it occasionally winks at the audience like a sitcom pilot. But writer-director Raymond De Felitta who made the Sundance favorite Two Family House back in 2000 refuses to look down on his characters. He cares about them enough to make them interesting and that goes a long way in a modest-size indie like this.Andy Garcia is Vince Rizzo a corrections officer who harbors dreams of acting. Shortly after we see him eyeing a convict (Steven Strait) we realize theres a connection that goes deeper than prison guard-inmate. Vince takes the guy home to the family and the newcomers presence is enough to alter the Rizzo family dynamics for good.City Island genially shows a family unraveling in different directions before the inevitable healing coming together. The ensemble clicks the laughs are earned and Alan Arkin has a priceless small part as Vinces acting teacher. I can think of far less pleasant ways to pass 100 minutes - many of them playing now at a theater near you. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Set in a small fishing community in the Bronx with a large population of Italian-Americans City Island is a warmly hilarious movie about family members and their secret hearts. Writer-director Raymond De Felitta (Two Family House) tells his story modestly but his gift for laughs laced with charm and bristling humanity is utterly irresistible. Andy Garcia showing an untapped flair for comedy gives one of his best and most beguiling performances as Vince Rizzo a prison guard (he prefers ""corrections officer"") whose wife Joyce (a sexy frisky Julianna Margulies) thinks hes cheating on her. In fact Vince is sneaking off to the big city to take acting lessons with a teacher hilariously deadpanned by Alan Arkin. Ill say no more. City Island is a relief for filmgoers dulled by Hollywood formula. Despite lapses into overstatement its nothing but good sweet breezy times.

Italian family with foibles secretsA ""City Island"" gathering (from left) Steven Strait Dominik Garcia-Lorido Andy Garcia Julianna Margulies and Ezra Miller. The Rizzo clan inhabits a Bronx island enclave with a close-up view of the Manhattan skyline.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted March 26 2010Whats not to like?In City Island a fractious Italian American clan - the Rizzos headed by Vince (Andy Garcia) and Joyce (Julianna Margulies working the New Yawk accent) - keeps deep secrets sneaks cigarettes assembles for dinner and then tears off in fits of rage bowls of pasta left behind.The teenage son (Ezra Miller) is trolling porn sites (plus-size women are his niche obsession). The college-age daughter (Dominik Garcia-Lorido Garcias real-life offspring) is working in a strip club unbeknownst to Mom and Dad. And then theres the tattooed parolee whom Vince brings home from his job as a prison guard. The young and strapping Tony Nardella (Steven Strait) in jail for boosting cars doesnt know why Vince has taken him under his wing. Nor does the rest of the family.Secrets. A soap operas worth.Nicely written and directed by Raymond De Felitta responsible for the similarly roiling Two Family House 10 years back City Island is set in the unreal - but very real - Bronx enclave of the title an idyllic fishing village plopped down in the water with a close-up view of the Manhattan skyline.Laced with humor and insight and featuring Garcia in uncharacteristically relaxed mode (even when hes yelling) City Island runs through its stockpile of impossibly melodramatic scenarios and manages to make them and the respective Rizzos in their throes feel genuine.And a couple of prize scenes attest to the filmmakers and Garcias love for their chosen vocation Vince is taking acting classes on the sly and his teacher (Alan Arkin) bursts into a wonderful rant about Brando and the dangers of the dramatic pause and then Vince improbably lands an audition for a new Scorsese/De Niro film. His screen test which starts with a terrible Brando impression and ends in a flurry of furious improvisation is classic.Whats not to like?Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Julianna Margulies and Andy Garcia reflect on the struggles of family life in City Island (Phil Caruso) Posted March 24 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT As Vince Rizzo a downtrodden prison guard who is a lifelong resident of City Island N.Y. (a fishing village on the outskirts of the Bronx) Andy Garcia reminds you of what a cunning likable actor he can be. In City Island Vince lives in fear of his shrewish wife (Julianna Margulies) and takes acting classes on the sly -- a twist that turns fun when he shows real talent. What isnt fun is the quirky parade of family contrivances (teen son with a fatty fetish daughter whos a secret stripper prisoner who turns out to be his illegitimate kid) that fill out the movie.

I have never particu larly warmed to Andy Garcia as an actor -- he always seems to be trying way too hard -- but he is quite wonderful as the head of a wildly dysfunctional Bronx family in Raymond De Felittas uproariously funny ""City Island."" Garcias accent may waver but hes entirely relaxed and ingratiating as Vince Rizzo a corrections officer and family man with a couple of whopping secrets. The first is that Tony (Steven Strait) the hunky prisoner hes brought home for a month to work on a home-improvement project is the product of a long-ago fling with the 20-somethings deceased mother. MORE ANDY GARCIAS DAUGHTER SHINES IN FAMILY BIZ Vinces long-suffering spouse (an excellent Julianna Margulies) is also unaware her hubby has secretly been taking acting lessons -- hiding his copy of ""An Actor Prepares"" in his bathroom along with his cigarettes. Hes hardly the only one in the family doing something on the sly. Their sexy daughter (played by Garcias real-life offspring Dominik Garcia-Lorido) has secretly flunked out of college and is working as a stripper complete with a set of new breast implants. Their son has a sexual fetish involving overweight women that he indulges by watching an older neighbor. Because hes unaware Vince is actually his father Tony is initially bemused by all these goings-on. But hes hardly innocent especially when his flirtations with the sexually frustrated woman he doesnt realize is his stepmother ends up in a make-out session at Orchard Beach. De Felitta who directed the wonderful ""Two Family House"" (2000) has a great feel for New York Citys further reaches and a very sure hand with actors. He also has the discipline necessary to pull off a farce like this one where everyones dirty laundry gets hung out to dry in a climactic scream-fest. The excellent cast also includes Emily Mortimer as Tonys acting classmate who would like to be more than his scene partner and Alan Arkin as their teacher who delivers a hilarious diatribe against Method acting. For me the movies high point comes when Tony auditions for a role in a Martin Scorsese movie. Tony learns not to try so hard -- a lesson that Garcia also seems to have absorbed from ""City Island."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Amanpour leaving CNN to host ABCs This Week Read Next Amanpour leaving CNN to host ABCs This Week Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46534 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22434 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 17212 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"City Island movie review Overcooked family comedy |       NJ.com comments City Island movie review Overcooked family comedy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 19 2010 at 432 AM View/Post Comments Emily Mortimer and Andy Garcia star in Anchor Bay Films ""City Island.""A tiny floating satellite of the mainland Bronx City Island is a place that requires a high tolerance for fried seafood bad traffic and nautical kitsch. ""City Island"" asks for even more forbearance.City Island (PG-13) Anchor Bay Films (100 min.) Directed by Raymond De Felitta. With Andy Garcia Julianna Margulies. Now playing in New York. Stephen Whittys rating Two Stars Rating note The film contains sexual situations strong language and brief violence.Crammed with ""colorful"" characters the movie takes us inside a secretive family -- a father (who wants to be an actor) a mother (who feels unloved) a daughter (whos working as a stripper) and a teenage son (who gets a sexual thrill from watching obese women eat). And then it drops another secret in their midst -- the ex-con son that Daddy never knew he had. This is incredibly overcrowded even for a New York household and it demands far too much of its audience. Were supposed to believe the father didnt know he had a son -- until the neer-do-well conveniently showed up as an inmate in the prison where he works as a guard? Or that tossed out of college the daughter then took a job at a strip club -- right near her family home? Doubtful. Admittedly there are some capable actors here working very hard with very little. Andy Garcia (who also helped produce) plays Vince the wannabe Brando and he has one great scene as an amateur actor fumbling his way through an audition. (Its the sort of scene good actors love to play.) And Julianna Margulies seems to enjoy trying out the angry spouse role she later took on in ""The Good Wife."" The cast also includes the always-appealing Emily Mortimer as a fellow acting student and cranky Alan Arkin as a drama coach who goes on a tirade about the completely artificial ""natural"" style. Theyre not enough though to compensate for the unappealing details. (The teenagers fetish for chubby-chaser porn is particularly off-putting.) And the family itself is so unpleasant -- every dinner is an explosion of thrown food and insults -- the humor soon turns into horror. Is it any surprise that Vinces appalled new son soon asks to be sent back to prison? Filmmaker Raymond De Felitta who made the much better ""Two Family House"" a decade ago clearly has an interest in blue-collar outer-borough life. But ""City Island"" shows no evidence of what binds this family together and no sense of its very specific setting. How is life in this place different than life somewhere else? Does it enlarge this familys experiences? Limit them? De Felitta and his movie have no idea. Instead he just keeps ladling on the shouted insults and freaky details -- like a cook covering up yesterdays fish with cheap red sauce.

"City Island | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; city-island ) City Island (United States 2010) March 15 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli There is something a little retro about the relaxing blend of screwball comedy and low-key drama that represents Raymond De Felittas City Island. An indie of the sort that achieved popularity during the 1990s but which has since fallen out of favor City Island offers jokes worth laughing at and characters who earn their good turns of fortune. As was the case in his earlier film Two Family House De Felitta shows an ability to find the humanity of his characters and play that characteristic both for laughs and for a more honest heartfelt response. Not everything in City Island works - some of the secrets are obvious plot devices - but in terms of feel-good undemanding entertainment this is as good as anything I have seen thus far in 2010. As we are told in an introductory monologue City Island is a one-square mile section of the Bronx - a fishing village comprised of ""mussle-suckers"" (newcomers to City Island) and ""clam-diggers"" (those whose families have lived there for generations). Prison guard Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) is a proud clam-digger but he has secrets. A closet actor he lies to his lovely wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies) about going to poker games when hes really traveling into the city to attend an acting class presided over by the opinionated Michael Malakov (Alan Arkin). Joyce recognizing her husband isnt being truthful suspects hes having an affair. But Vince has an even bigger secret a newly paroled prisoner (Steven Strait) who has been offered lodging on his property isnt just some random ex-con; hes Vinces son. No one knows this except Vince and Molly (Emily Mortimer) his partner at the acting class. Vince isnt the only one with secrets. His son Vince Jr. (Ezra Miller) has a fetish for fat women. His daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido) works as a stripper. And as the story progresses there are opportunities for more truths to be hidden until they all come tumbling out in a scene of pinpoint comedic timing and surprising dramatic tension. City Island gives Andy Garcia the opportunity to play an ""everyman"" something of a rarity for the tough-guy actor who normally portrays cops or mobsters. Vince is blue collar through-and-through and treats his passion for acting as if its a dirty secret. He slips into the bathroom to read a book on Marlon Brando and hides his videotapes of the actors movies in a place where his wife is unlikely to find them. The analogy is a teenager with porn magazines - and thats the level of shame Vince feels. Garcia is very good in the role reminding us of how much he has grown since he was a young hotshot with limited emotional range in The Untouchables. With her hair straightened Julianna Margulies hardly resembles the actress who cut her teeth on E.R. opposite George Clooney. De Felitta gives her some biting dialogue which she spits out with real venom. Shes got a soft side too which is a good thing for Vince. Emily Mortimer is underused filling the role of Vinces confidant. Its a nice role-reversal; this sort of part normally goes to an actor allowing for some male bonding. The Vince/Molly relationship is strictly platonic which is another welcome touch - Narrative 101 would call for a romance. Theres also a sly in-joke related to Mortimers accent. The secondary characters are provided with just enough meat on their subplots to keep them interesting without threatening to dominate the story. Vince Jr. is smart but socially inept and he likes big women. His pick-up lines need work. When asking out a plus-size girl at school he suggests this activity for their date ""I could feed you donuts."" Guess how far that gets him. Vivian is annoyed at having to go home for spring break since it means giving up shifts at the strip joint. And Michael turns out not to be the ideal role model for struggling would-be actors. De Felittas ""insider"" perspective into the ups-and-downs of breaking into show business shines through in many of Vinces scenes. Mollys speech about the realities of an audition is both funny and insightful; it italicizes truths about acting while maintaining a sense of humor. Sadly in this economy her description of the wrenching experience of trying to get a gig will meet with universal understanding. Today its not just actors who stand in long lines and face summary rejection when applying for an employment opportunity. City Island builds to a big climax where things go pretty much as we expect - and hope - they will. Still even though the results may be unsurprising the trajectory taken by the characters to reach that point sometimes is not. De Felitta toys with the audience by presenting formulas and rejecting them. Expected events dont always occur as we anticipate. Thats how the movie ends up simultaneously feeling comfortable and unconventional. Its not deep or challenging but it is enjoyable.

The secrets and lies overstuff the plot--a thread involving Vince and a fellow thesp hopeful played by Emily Mortimer is especially superfluous--and set up too many misunderstandings played for laughs culminating in the usual tidy conclusion of forgiveness and acceptance. But writer-director Raymond De Felitta (2000s Two Family House) keeps his comedy of dysfunction afloat with sharp specifics ""I went to Oneonta"" Joyce protests at the dinner table after Vince warns his kids of the dead-end future of those who are B.A.-less like Mom and Dad. An affectionate portrait of a lower-middle-class outer-borough clan City Island works best as an actors showcase with Marguliess aggrieved simmering wife the stand-out. And though his accent is inconsistent Garcia fully explores the corrosive consequences of having to conceal a dog-eared copy of An Actor Prepares in the bathroom.
