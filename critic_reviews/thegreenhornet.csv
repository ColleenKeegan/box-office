Many are the films that have been saved in the editing room or at least been rendered releasable. Even already promising movies have been made great by gifted editors. Consider the justly revered (and much imitated) runaway baby carriage sequence in director Sergei Eisensteins 1925 masterpiece ""Battleship Potemkin."" In 1952s ""High Noon"" its thanks to Elmo Williams razor sharp cross-cutting along with Fred Zinnemanns direction that the classic western builds to its tense climax. And ditto that star Gary Coopers look of pain -- he was suffering from a bleeding stomach ulcer during filming-comes across as steely determination. Director Arthur Penn and producer-star Warren Beatty both have long acknowledged the enormous contribution that the late editor Dede Allen made to 1967s ""Bonnie and Clyde"" especially in the final brutally spasmodic shoot-out scene. Sometimes though an editors most valuable contribution can be to cut cut cut and keep cutting. As in shorten the movie. As in take out 20 or 30 minutes even though the director keeps moaning that this scene is his or her most brilliant work. How many movies have you sat through recently during which you were mentally wielding scissors? Theres a lot of throat clearing and warming up in movies especially in the early stretches. Snip off that extended expository opening the lengthy chase scenes and that declamatory comic monologue by the leading man and we could all be out of the theater way sooner. Case in point ""The Green Hornet"" which clocks in at a bloated 118 minutes. There is not I promise you 118 minutes worth of vital plot special effects or comic business in this movie. There is maybe and Im being generous here 80 minutes worth -- and even that 80 minutes in sub-par stuff. The movie is a sad misfire. Much of the blame can be pinned on star and co-producer Seth Rogens uninspired script which he co-wrote with Evan Goldberg. It roughly follows the outlines of the classic Green Hornet story -- which originated on radio and then migrated to comic books the big screen and TV Brett Reid (Rogen) a wealthy newspaper publisher becomes a crime-fighting vigilante aided by Kato his mono-monikered Asian chauffer-sidekick (played here by Taiwanese music star Jay Chou). Rogen spends most of ""Hornet"" frenetically trying to goose his own pallid screenplay to life. Its as if hes believes that if he could just raise his energy level another notch it would make up for the fact that there is a great big empty maw where a viable plot and characters belong. To borrow a phrase from that well-known fanboy Gertrude Stein theres no there there. ""Hornets"" characters have the heft and dimension of paper matchsticks and the wispy plot -- how Reid becomes the Green Hornet and takes on L.A.s biggest crime boss (Christoph Waltz who is at least funny) -- is about as involving as your Aunt Sallys latest anecdote about the center piece she devised for her bridge clubs luncheon. Director Michel Gondry who has brought such an inventive almost child-like touch to small intimate films like ""Human Nature"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" seems here to have gotten lost in the make-it-a-blockbuster shuffle. As for the well-hyped 3D like ""Clash of the Titans"" it was retrofitted to 3D rather than originally shot that way -- thats a big mehhh. Cmon if youre going to have 3D at least let Cameron Diaz (whose role is nothing but decoration) shake her shapely booty in our faces. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

In theatres on January 14 2011. Photo Courtesy of Sony Pictures/ Jaimie Trueblood Photo Credit Sony Pictures Photo/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two dudes decide to become vigilantes. BOTTOM LINE A handful of laughs and good ideas but otherwise a hopeless mess CAST Seth Rogen Jay Chou Cameron Diaz Christoph Waltz WHEN/WHERE ""The Green Hornet"" showtimes and tickets LENGTH 158 When Seth Rogen announced he would write and star in a movie version of ""The Green Hornet"" comics we laughed Superstoner When he began dropping pounds for the role we grew concerned The whole point of Rogen is that he isnt Tobey Maguire. And when semisurrealist director Michel Gondry (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") signed on we drew a blank Huh? What is this movie trying to be? Even after sitting through it you wont have an answer. Part origin story part spoof part bromance - the movie cant decide. It winks at itself constantly but only to hide its cluelessness. advertisement | advertise on newsday Rogen plays Britt Reid an irresponsible playboy who inherits The Daily Sentinel after the death of his hard-nosed father James (Tom Wilkinson). In his now-empty mansion Britt meets house staffer Kato (Jay Chou a charming Taiwanese actor making his U.S. debut) who happens to be a martial-arts expert and inventor of Bond-quality weaponry. Britt can barely throw a punch but the new friends decide to don masks fight crime and bring down Los Angeles most ruthless mobster Chudnofksy (a squandered Christoph Waltz). Rogen and longtime co-writer Evan Goldberg keep trying to upend the superhero genre What if the Green Hornet were a doofus? What if he and Kato fought over the girl (Cameron Diaz)? What if the movie replaced earnest comic-book dialogue with flippant dude-speak? Gondrys distinctively odd touches (stretched-out backgrounds cartoonish action) and the pointless 3-D effects only throw everything further off balance. One thing about superhero movies At least they have compelling characters and plots. But everyone here was too clever to think of that.

Case in point ""The Green Hornet"" comes from Original Film a production company. So the credits state twice. ""Are they trying to be ironic?"" you may wonder -- long before its clear that this derivative outing has no intention of honoring the company name. After all ""The Green Hornet"" -- about a masked vigilante who is a newspaper publisher by day -- was a radio series in the 1930s a film serial in the 1940s and for one season beginning in 1966 a television series. And the concept of a big-screen version has bounced around the movie biz since the late 1990s cresting with indie maverick Kevin Smiths desire to give it a go in 2004 -- and then waning until this project written by star Seth Rogen and writing partner Evan Goldberg. Rogen plays Britt Reid neer-do-well scion of Daily Sentinel publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson). The movie provides a quickie psychological profile of a well-intentioned kid chastised by a steely widower. Dad is ethical but compassion-challenged. He beheads an action figure for goodness sake He rakes the Los Angeles muck while Britt wallows in it partying and posing. Asian pop sensation Jay Chou portrays Kato the Shanghai orphan barista (dont ask) retooler of awesome autos and soon-to-be partner in crime-fighting. When Dad dies Britt becomes publisher of the Daily Sentinel where newsman Axford (Edward James Olmos) and new assistant Lenore (Cameron Diaz) must endure Britts boorish ways. His is a slow very slow transformation. ""The Green Hornet"" begins with with vague promise. An underworld interloper (likely Oscar nominee James Franco in an uncredited chewy bit) meets with L.A. crime boss Benjamin Chudnofsky (last years Oscar winner Christoph Waltz). The mobster listens as his rival riffs on the style of criminal enterprise its fashion and other ""out with the old in with the new"" verities. You dont have to be a racket scientist to figure out what Chudnofskys thinking Its the substance of crime -- its violence -- that matters. And theres plenty of comic-book-style mayhem as Green Hornet Kato and Chudnofsky head for the inevitable long- winded showdown. Two things remain memorable about the short-lived cult-status TV series the shows buzzy theme song which repurposed Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakovs famous interlude courtesy of Al Hirt (think ""Fight of the Bumblebee."") And icon Bruce Lees debut as Kato. But despite its obvious angling to become a franchise this ""Green Hornet"" offers little thats worth committing to even the ""cult flick"" chamber of your brain. ""THE GREEN HORNET.""PG-13 Rated PG-13 for sequences of violent action language sensuality and drug content. 1 hour 59 minutes. Directed by Michel Gondry; written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg; based on the radio series created by George W.

Those kinds of men-children are the heroes of Seth Rogenas The Green Hornet update and the clubfooted comedy The Dilemma which stars Vince Vaughn as a guy who discovers a secret about the wife of his best friend (Kevin James). And on the evidence the genre in which grown-up buddies wrestle with their masculinity while acting like juveniles is looking mighty limp. At least The Green Hornet is likable and a refreshing change from the heavy angst-ridden superhero pictures so beloved by obnoxious fanboys. The director is Michel Gondry who proved in The Science of Sleep to be a virtuoso at making childish fantasies take wing. And Im not the first to notice a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road-movie vibe between the two stars Rogen as Britt Reid (a.k.a. the Green Hornet) and Jay Chou as the kung fu master Kato -- both smitten with Cameron Diaz in the Dorothy Lamour role. The thrust is Oedipal. Rogens Britt is a neer-do-well rich kid son of a disapproving media mogul (Tom Wilkinson) who in a prologue suddenly tears the head off his little sons superhero doll. Later when the dad drops dead from a bee sting Britt and Kato (who was his fathers assistant) knock the head off the old mans graveside statue. That marks the birth of the Green Hornet -- the self-styled criminal who fights criminals. Both for P.C. reasons and because Chou is a big star in the all-important Asian market Kato refuses to be Britts sidekick. So he and Rogen trade lame insults while fighting off bad guys chief among them Christoph Waltz as a Russian mobster. What a difference it makes when Quentin Tarantino isnt writing your lines. The Hope-Crosby thing might work better if the quips were fresh and Chou was comfortable with English. He speaks as if he learned it phonetically and unlike Bruce Lees Kato in the old TV show he talks a lot. His fighting -- heavily edited -- isnt especially enlivening either. Gondry who often uses sophisticated CGI to create a rough-hewn handmade look doesnt have a way with smash-and-bash car chases. There are a few neat trick shots in which Chou moves at a different speed than his slo-mo adversaries and a couple of good 3-D effects like the split screens in which each frame is at a different spatial level. But The Green Hornet doesnt seem worth the outrageous 3-D-glasses surcharge. In all senses theres little that jumps out at you. But its The Dilemma that really lays there. Vaughns Ronny and Jamess Nick are auto-industry vets looking to score a new contract and their big idea is practically a metaphor for the inner world of men-children. Explaining to executives that electric cars are ""totally gay"" Ronny proposes a responsible energy-efficient vehicle that makes loud vroom-vroom noises like those cool old Fords and Dodges. (At the risk of sounding ""gay"" I dont think we need more road noise in this world.) The movie turns on their women though. Longtime bachelor Ronny thinks hard about taking the commitment plunge with his dull girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly) getting his cues from the happy marriage of Nick and Geneva (Winona Ryder). Then while practicing his proposal at an indoor nursery he spies Geneva smooching a heavily tattooed Channing Tatum. Should he tell his buddy and shatter him and maybe ruin the project on which everything in their lives rides? Or should he -- for now -- keep it a secret? His contortions moral and physical (lots of spying and tripping over things) occupy the next 90 minutes. Perhaps the late Blake Edwards could have found a balance between slapstick and psychodrama but Ron Howard cant get the pacing right and Allan Loebs script is even wordier than the one he wrote for Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. Vaughn has a couple of very funny scenes and Winona Ryder a good demonic glint but the movie cheats like mad The noisy engine on which so much of the plot hangs isnt affected one way or another by all the domestic chaos. The Dilemma comes down to whether Ronny can help the cuckolded Nick recover his masculine pride. This is symbolized by a scene in a pro-hockey arena in which cheered on by his bud Nick enters a contest to use his big stick to drive a puck into a small black hole. Even Dr. Freud would roll his eyes and tell the filmmakers to grow the hell up.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Green Hornet amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Summer Wars The Dilemma >> The Green Hornet Oddball auteur Michel Gondry has directed scramblers (Human Nature) flops (Be Kind Rewind) modern classics (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and even comedy shows (Dave Chapelles Block Party). But The Green Hornet is new turf a crowd-pleaser. (And a fine one.) Gondry was writer-star Seth Rogens big push--they had to convince the studio that he wasnt going to make a 120 million superhero flick out of cardboard and sequins. What the dynamic duo did was remind Sony Pictures--and us--that Gondry upended action movies before he ever made one in 1998 he invented ""bullet time"" for a Smirnoff ad and then glowered as the Wachowski Brothers poached his brainstorm for The Matrix. His Green Hornet is solid workmanship shot through with playful tricks. When Kato (Taiwanese megastar Jay Chou) throws a bad guy over a car hood the force makes the car quadruple sending the villain skittering across like a skipping stone. And Gondrys perfectionism means that the post-converted 3D is truly gorgeous--a first--giving the industry a chance to apologize to audiences burned by Clash of the Titans and The Last Airbender (assuming audiences are still willing to pony up for Hornet in 3D which they should.) The Green Hornet is one of the oldest and overlooked franchise heroes. Hes got 38 years on Wolverine and even three on Batman. In this updated origin myth newspaper scion Britt Reid (Rogen) is Paris Hilton with a penis. When his estranged father dies leaving him the Daily Sentinel Reid sobers up enough to find out that his dads mechanic (Chou) can build a bulletproof car perfect for pranking Los Angeles street gangs. Why start a street war? Because therapy is expensive. The two ignite the wrath of uber leader Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz) an aging ambitious thug who kills for the PR. The big twist is that Britt and Kato pose as criminals to buy them more time from the underworld (they came up with the idea while drunk.) The better twist is that Britt is outclassed by Kato an effortlessly cool Chinese orphan who can play piano make espresso design weaponry and dropkick a goon as easily as a hacky sack. What Kato cant do is speak English but Chou phonetically powers through in a breakout performance--hes cooler than cool even if he cant pronounce ""hubcap."" Rogen and Chou have breezy buddy-flick charm. When they clink beers you wish you could invite yourself into their toast. And Rogen and co-writer Evan Goldsteins script doesnt shy away from their superior/salaryman dynamic. As Kato kicks ass Reid demotes him from partner to sidekick and writes him out of the headlines. Can a genius and an average Joe pair up and put egos aside to serve mindless adventure? Gondry and Rogen have. And their popcorn flick is pure perfect entertainment.

But despite the screen-time lavished on the cape-and-tights contingent Hollywood has been somewhat leery of their fedora-ed forbears those unfortunate masked vigilantes from before the Age of Lycra. The Shadow was released in 1994 featuring an Alec Baldwin whose primary endowment was a nose that elongated Pinocchio-like whenever it sniffed evil lurking in the hearts of men. Frank Millers dispiriting take on The Spirit a couple of years ago could easily have laid the subgenre to rest for a generation. Yet hope springs eternal and here we find ourselves amid buzz for The Green Hornet. MORE ON SUPERHERO MOVIES Ta-Nehisi Coates 10 Years Since The First X-Men MovieChristopher Orr Iron Man 2 Shellheads Back but the Stark Is GoneScott Meslow 5 Ways to Revive the Superman Franchise Seth Rogen co-wrote the screenplay with writing partner Evan Goldberg and stars improbably as the titular hero. Direction is supplied by the always-interesting--and occasionally transcendent--Michel Gondry who becomes the second Frenchman to tackle the subject in the last five years. (A thin-but-energetic short starring the wonderfully named stuntman/martial artist Manu Lanzi was directed by the still-more-wonderfully-named Aurelien Poitrimoult in 2006.) Given the unlikely talents involved it is perhaps little surprise that the The Green Hornet is a pastiche of action and comedy pulp drama and bromance. At its best the film is sly and irreverent enlivening an exhausted genre like an Apatowian Iron Man. At its worst its an ungainly hybrid suffering not only from the flaws common to 3-D action movies (yes the filmmakers will eventually find occasion to hurl a pickup truck into a bus) but from its own conflicting impulses and ambitions as well. Rogen plays Britt Reid the lazy dissolute son of newspaper publisher James Reid (Tom Wilkinson) who dies--accident? murder? have you ever seen a superhero movie?--early in the proceedings. Dad having been something of a jerk however it is not this death that jolts Britt from his porcine complacency; rather its the discovery the next morning that his customary cappuccino is not up to usual standards. It turns out that he has inadvertently fired the manorial barista Kato (Jay Chou). Britt re-summons said servant to have him demonstrate the proper use of his hand-built Rube-Goldberg espresso machine. (Prepare yourself for involuntarily erotic murmurs from coffee-drinkers in the audience.) Britt soon learns that Kato also served as his dads chauffeur and mechanic and has a particular aptitude for equipping vehicles with bulletproof glass retractable machineguns and other out-of-the-ordinary upgrades. That night mutually miffed at the encomia being delivered in memory of James--who was as unlovable an employer as he was a father--the two young men set out to vandalize a statue erected in his honor. In the course of their mischief they fall more or less by accident into the role of crime fighters. Back at the newspaper he has inherited Britt takes pains to ensure that the escalating antics of the newly dubbed ""Green Hornet"" remain front-page news. (He is in Spider-Man terms his own J. Jonah Jameson.) There are elements of a sharp hero/sidekick inversion here Kato is the handsome brilliant inventor and karate expert; Britt is well rich enough to pay the salary of someone like Kato. But the inversion is inevitably incomplete. This is after all Rogens film. (Chou a Taiwanese pop star is only passably fluent in English.) So for all Britts shortcomings--he is by turns self-centered and self-loathing and resolutely devoid of any discernible talent--he must ultimately rise to the occasion of top billing. This metamorphosis from zero to hero is a sluggish one As Britt bickers jealously with Kato around the three-quarter mark of the film its easy to conclude that Jamess low opinion of his offspring was not without merit. Thanks to Britts prolonged petulance and the de rigueur action finale the last third of The Green Hornet sags appreciably. Still the film bestows its share of notable amusements. In the underwritten role of crime-boss Chudnofsky Christophe Waltz offers the same dry insinuating charm he brought to the role of Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds a vulnerability within the villainy. Likewise Cameron Diaz has her moments in the Pepper-Potts-y role of Britts assistant Lenore Case--in particular an unexpectedly head-on gag about her advancing age in youth-obsessed Hollywood. Rogen supplies himself with a healthy share of Rogenesque laughs while reserving a few for Pineapple Express co-star James Franco who appears in an uncredited cameo. There are frequent likable nods to the original ""Green Hornet"" radio show the snatches of classical music a glimpsed sketch of Bruce Lee Britts insistence that hell be a more effective hero if the public believes him to be a criminal. And though Gondry fails to imbue the film with the touching humanism of his best work (Eternal Sunshine Be Kind Rewind) he contributes an appealing visual whimsy to the proceedings.At the end just as it seems the film--like the Hornets tricked-out 1965 Chrysler Imperial--may have run completely out of gas it abruptly shifts gears for a brief but witty coda featuring the all-but-forgotten Diaz. Its a finale disappointing only in that it serves as a reminder of just how far astray the film had wandered during its requisite car-crash-and-gunfire phase. Last week Lynda Obst made a persuasive case that the economic obligations of the foreign market were strangling American film comedy. (Short version jokes often dont translate; explosions are universal.) The Green Hornet suggests that the balance may have been upset not only between movies but within them as well.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

Together they fight crime by posing as villains. By Peter Rainer Film critic January 14 2011 Save for later Saved Seth Rogen (l.) and Jay Chou are shown in a scene from the film The Green Hornet. Jaimie Trueblood/Columbia Pictures-Sony/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""The Green Hornet"" directed by Michel Gondry is such a feeble excuse for an action comedy that its already taken pride of place in my upcoming worst-movies-of-2011 list. Seth Rogen who also co-wrote the humor-free script plays spoiled playboy heir Britt Reid. Jay Chou is his martial-artist-whiz sidekick Kato. Together they fight crime by posing as villains cruising the Los Angeles night streets in their souped-up mid-60s Chrysler Imperial. Christoph Waltz does a variation on his Nazi baddie from ""Inglorious Basterds"" to much lesser effect. This material has a pedigree. What began 75 years ago as a radio show and then morphed into a TV show two movie serials and comic books has now arrived at what I fervently hope is its final resting place. Heres a 3-D movie that should have been shot in Zero-D.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Seth Rogen gets pounded hard on the Web for daring to take on the role of the Green Hornet. ""Explain to me why a chubby putz is playing a superhero?"" typed one Internet buzz-killer. Well the chubby putz gets the last laugh. For starters Rogen is no longer flabby -- a trainer took care of that. And the big-screen Green Hornet while hardly classic comic-book filmmaking aint half bad. Theres talent and ambition in this 100 million-plus epic thanks to Rogen and the visual wizardry (in 3D and 2D) of director Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) even when the action gets frenetic and the twisty plot goes off the rails. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews The Green Hornet in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers."" Rogen 28 and his Superbad writing partner Evan Goldberg have been comics-obsessed since the Hornet seduced their horny teen hearts. Why not? The heros alter ego Britt Reid is a party animal and heir to the newspaper fortune of his father (Tom Wilkinson). When Daddy gets murdered Britt hires a secretary Lenore Case (a superfluous Cameron Diaz) who is older and smarter than he is. He teams up with Kato (Taiwanese singer Jay Chou) the family chauffeur a gadget-maker and martial artist to exact revenge. Theyll fight crime by pretending to be criminals themselves. And they wear masks just like the Lone Ranger and Tonto. No accident since George W. Trendle and Fran Striker who developed The Green Hornet as a 1930s radio serial had done the same for The Lone Ranger. The 10 Best Movies of 2010 The Green Hornet which predated Batman has a historic legacy in radio comics movies and a cult 1966 TV series that starred Van Williams as Reid and the immortal Bruce Lee as Kato. Rogen didnt want to stink up the franchise by dragging it into dumb farce. But he wanted laughs and an action-buddy vibe in an L.A. underworld. The film lost other directors along the way including Kevin Smith and later Hong Kong master Stephen Chow (Kung Fu Hustle). When Nicolas Cage retreated as Russian villain Benjamin Chudnofsky (he reportedly wanted to use a Jamaican accent mon) in went Christoph Waltz fresh from his Oscar for Inglourious Basterds. Good move. Waltz has an early run-in with a newbie thug (a juicy cameo from James Franco) who insults him as a drooling dinosaur. Waltzs deadpan reaction before the inevitable brutal explosion is priceless. The 10 Greatest Film and TV Superheroes Despite the rumors and the graveyard January opening The Green Hornet doesnt suck. But dont expect it to hang together either what with the clashing tones and melting logic. Rogen doesnt make much of an action hero but he plays his lack of superpowers for maximum fun. Chous physical grace more than compensates. It helps that Gondry can stage a dazzling set piece without editing it into incomprehension (yes I mean you Michael Bay). The fight between Britt and Kato is a 3D whiz-bang with objects flying everywhere. And the Black Beauty a tricked-out Chrysler Imperial fully loaded with weaponry could make the Dark Knight green with envy. Gondry developed a visual style called Kato-Vision that lets us see things through Katos ever-vigilant eyes. The knockout scene shows Kato in superspeed battling villains moving in slow motion. Cool stuff even as we keep on wishing that the Hornet had more sting in his tail.

Updated July 30 2016  1053 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movies Close Columbia Pictures Seth Rogen (left) and Jay Chou in ""The Green Hornet"" (Columbia Pictures) Green Hornet Rogen rocks in comedic take on Green Hornet BY CALVIN WILSON  calvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com  314-340-8346 Jan 14 2011 (...) Columbia Pictures Seth Rogen (left) and Jay Chou in ""The Green Hornet"" (Columbia Pictures) Seth Rogen is the Green Hornet. What else do you need to know?Best known as the guy from ""Knocked Up"" Rogen would seem an unlikely choice to portray the no-nonsense vigilante of comic book radio and TV fame. But this film takes a humorous and largely entertaining approach to the crime-fighting saga.Rogen is a perfect fit for newspaper heir Britt Reid who discovers that chasing crooks can be fun. Wielding a gun full of knockout gas and patrolling the streets in an indestructible car that would make the Batmobile envious Reid gets quality assistance from Kato (Jay Chou) whose martial-arts moves are right out of ""The Matrix.""Reids secretary Lenore (Cameron Diaz) warns that the Hornet is headed for trouble. But hes too busy pursuing Chudnofksy (Christoph Waltz) a criminal kingpin who frets about his image. ""The Green Hornet"" was directed by Michel Gondry whose work includes ""The Science of Sleep"" and the brilliant ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" Charlie Kaufman won an Oscar for scripting ""Sunshine"" and its too bad he wasnt involved with ""Hornet."" Rogen and co-screenwriter Evan Goldberg are good at the funny stuff but the crime plot is disappointingly boilerplate. Still the film has the potential to be a big hit. Rogen hasnt been this funny since ""Pineapple Express"" and Chou is terrific as his talented partner. But Waltz an Oscar winner for his spectacular performance in ""Inglourious Basterds"" doesnt have much to work with.

"The Green Hornet review Crude crusader |       NJ.com comments The Green Hornet review Crude crusader Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 14 2011 at 809 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1056 AM View/Post Comments Seth Rogen left and Jay Chou star in ""The Green Hornet."" How much you like ""The Green Hornet"" will depend on how much you like the Green Hornet. True fans of the business-suited vigilante -- who began his career on radio before moving on to comics serials a TV show and more comics -- are not going to be pleased. Devout fans of Seth Rogen -- the writer/performer who has his own ""Pineapple Express""/""Observe and Report"" style of schlubby snarky comedy -- are going to laugh their masks off. Because unlike other genre movies which had an occasional sense of humor -- the ""Iron Man"" pictures some of the early ""Batman"" films -- this adventure aims for flat-out frat-boy farce. Rogens Britt Reid may live like Bruce Wayne and think hes Tony Stark. But hes really just a vulgar jerk -- throwing tantrums over mediocre cappuccinos before crudely coming on to his secretary (and then firing her when he thinks shes dating someone else). No this is not your typical ""caped crusader"" movie. It is though a fairly typical Seth Rogen movie. On that level it works pretty well for a while. Slimmed down or not Rogen is hardly closeup-friendly particularly in 3-D. But he has a good ear for rude dialogue and he works well with other actors (his scenes with Jay Chous Kato have a nice back-and-forth rhythm). Hes also helped by the directing of art house auteur Michael Gondry (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") who has actually been interested in this material for years. (How long has ""The Green Hornet"" been in development? At one point Greg Kinnear was set to star.) Gondry always a daring visualist does startlingly novel things with 3-D (at one point moving to split-screen photography -- and having each scene unfold on a different plane). He makes the gadgets including the Hornets muscle car the Black Beauty pop off the screen. But once you get to the fiends and fights that make a comic book movie really work things go stale. The villain a mobster played by Christoph Waltz of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is merely dull. (Waltz replaced Nicolas Cage who decided the movie was too violent -- proof that yes he actually does turn some things down.) And Cage was right. The movie is far too violent (the PG-13 rating was a gift) and too clumsily imitative of ""Pineapple Express."" Like that picture it has a huge brawl between former friends that destroys several rooms. (Yet nothing is as good as that films attack-by-DustBuster.) And also like that picture it ends in a chaotic over-the-top massacre -- but one so exaggerated that after the first dozen or so deaths you cease to care. James Franco by the way -- the hilarious stoner from ""Pineapple"" -- shows up in an unbilled cameo here and Cameron Diaz co-stars. Funny. In her first movie ""The Mask"" she played opposite Jim Carreys green-faced hero; 15 years later shes playing opposite Seth Rogens green-themed one. This isnt a career arc; its a flat line. Its time someone rescued the nervy naughty Diaz and put her in something really good. It might not be a job for Britt Reid and Kato. But its something a great agent should get on soon. Ratings note The film contains strong language and excessive violence. The Green Hornet (PG-13) Columbia (118 min.) Directed by Michel Gondry. With Seth Rogen Jay Chou Cameron Diaz Christoph Waltz. Now playing in New York.

"Movie review The Green Hornet - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review The Green HornetThe Seth Rogen action comedy is in the running for most tedious superhero movie ever.January 14 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jay Chou (left) and Seth Rogen star in ""The Green Hornet."" (Jaimie Trueblood Columbia...)""The Green Hornet"" may not be the most tedious superhero movie ever a the competition is admittedly tough a but it is certainly in the running. An anemic 97-pound weakling of the action comedy persuasion ""Hornet"" is a boring bromedy that features mumblecore heroics instead of the real thing. Though the Hornets been around since the 1930s in various incarnations including a TV series that featured the one-of-a-kind Bruce Lee as his sidekick Kato the Hornets technically not a superhero at all. Rather like his animal kingdom cohort Batman the Hornet fights crime from behind a mask with just his ordinary human powers plus nifty inventions like a tricked-out Chrysler Imperial. Invention however is whats lacking in this latest version. Neither director Michel Gondry nor star Seth Rogen (who also co-wrote with Evan Goldberg) have been able to bring even a semblance of life to an inert enterprise that did itself no favors by converting to 3-D late in the game. Gondry and Rogen are not the obvious go-to guys for this kind of big-budget action project (estimates run as high as 130 million) and from the look of the ruins that remain they attempted to use their unlikeliness to their advantage. Why not they must have thought bring in a hero who not only doesnt have any superpowers but also is a bumbling and ineffectual fool? And why not turn the whole thing over to a director who is known for the unconventional nature of his work (like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") and for never doing what anyone else would do? These ideas sound plausible in theory but the attempt to implement them has been ruinous. For one thing Rogen has had enough success in films like ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" to believe that everything he says or does is automatically funny. It isnt. As for Gondry making a film like this seems to have completely baffled him. He has no special feeling for the frequent action sequences which 3-D has not helped at all and he has brought nothing of interest either conventional or otherwise to the rest of the proceedings. Set in a time before newspapers regularly languished in bankruptcy court ""Green Hornet"" introduces us to young wastrel Britt Reid (Rogen) the son of fabulously wealthy and influential newspaper publisher James Reid (a squandered Tom Wilkinson). Nursing a grudge against his father that goes back to a childhood incident involving the decapitation of an action figure (dont ask) Britt has dedicated his life to being a party animal. An unexpected death however shocks Britts world. And when he discovers that his fathers former employee Kato (Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou) has enough hidden talents to be called ""a human Swiss Army knife"" he decides that calling himself the Green Hornet and being part of a crime-fighting duo is an endeavor with a future. Though Chou (in his American acting debut) has an amusing presence as the English-challenged Kato Rogens Britt is less inviting. His dialogue (which he wrote himself) is doubtless intended to be tongue-in-cheek funny but lines like ""Its unbelievable how cool we are"" are as pointless as they sound. Similarly lost are the films two costars. Christoph Waltz reportedly a late replacement for Nicolas Cage is ineffectual as the films villain du jour Benjamin Chudnofsky. Even worse off is a beleaguered Cameron Diaz as Lenore Case Britts secretary and the woman whose affections the boys ineptly battle each other for when theyre not preparing to square off against Chudnofsky. ""Girls are such a bore"" the Hornet proclaims at one point apropos of nothing in particular. Not as much of a bore however as what we have here. kenneth.turanlatimes.com The Green Hornet MPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of violent action language sensuality and drug content Running time 1 hour 48 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESGreen Hornets Michel Gondry dreaming big in HollywoodJanuary 13 2011The Green Hornet tries to buzzJuly 24 2010Getting The Green Hornet off the groundJuly 23 2010Seth Rogen linked to `Hornet projectJuly 20 2007MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentGreen HornetEvan GoldbergBritt ReidCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-green-hornet-20110114,0,7585005.story",200,thegreenhornet11,thegreenhornet,latimes

(Columbia/Everett) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday January 14 2011 400 AM Title The Green Hornet Action comedy about an unlikely vigilante. With Seth Rogen Jay Chou. Director Michel Gondry (148). PG-13 Violence language sexuality drugs. At area theaters. Well what do you know? Out of the barren landscape of January comes a movie thats actually worth our while. As actors dropped in and directors dropped out buzz on ""The Green Hornet"" grew increasingly worse. When it was scheduled for this month -- a time famously reserved for mind-numbing duds -- expectations hit rock-bottom. Turns out Michel Gondry has crafted an irreverently funny ultramodern take on the 1930s radio serial with a vibe so casual you half expect star Seth Rogen to amble off screen and put his feet up on the seat next to you. That slacker attitude is an act of course. A movie this determined to entertain requires hard work. And no one had to work harder than Rogen to prove he could play a classic hero. Always an unlikely leading man Rogen -- who co-wrote the rambling wisecracking script with Evan Goldberg -- smartly acknowledges the improbable casting by making his Britt Reid the most incompetent vigilante imaginable. A notorious partier stuck in an extended and well-funded adolescence Reid chafes against the strict expectations of his publisher father (Tom Wilkinson). But when tragedy strikes he finds a calling and his first true friend thanks to Dads gadget-minded mechanic (Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou no rival to predecessor Bruce Lee). Together Kato and Britt -- now the Green Hornet -- decide to take down violent drug lord Chudnofsky (an amusingly deadpan Christoph Waltz). But since they dont really know what theyre doing they enlist help from aspiring journalist Lenore (Cameron Diaz) and make up the rest as they go along. Its a novel approach to big-screen heroics and one the filmmakers embrace. In fact Gondry is surprisingly well-suited for a big-budget popcorn adventure. While his projects occasionally threaten to float away on a cloud of whimsy the outlandish requirements of this genre  -- like explosive action scenes -- somehow keep him grounded. At the same time his sense of humor and acute visual skill turn a cheerfully unfocused superhero flick into an unexpectedly fun ride. In fact Id even welcome plans for a sequel -- and if its released in January all the better. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movie reviews Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The ""last family-owned newspaper in Los An geles"" is figuratively and literally trashed as its moronic new playboy publisher turns publicity-seeking vigilante in ""The Greet Hornet"" an overblown interminable and unfunny update (in badly added 3-D) of the long-running 30s radio show and short-lived 60s TV series. Played by a slimmed-down but woefully miscast Seth Rogen Britt Reid is already a gossip-column fixture for his hard-partying ways. But when he takes the helm of the Daily Sentinel following the death of his despised father (Tom Wilkinson) under suspicious circumstances Britt puts himself on the front page. And he commissions a nom de vigilante from his editors -- after Britt and his chauffeur/barista Kato stop muggers while decapitating his fathers statue as a drunken prank. There might be a funny movie in a story about a crime fighter whos in it only for the publicity but ""The Green Hornet"" isnt it. Impersonally directed by the quirky Michel Gondry (the wonderful ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") on a ridiculously lavish scale after two decades in development hell its mostly a fourth-rate buddy comedy with Taiwanese pop star Jay Chous Kato suffering through the stupidity and bumbling of his employer. Chous English is barely serviceable and its typical of the level of wit on offer in ""The Great Hornet"" that when Kato says he ""grew up penniless"" Britt interprets this to mean he ""grew up penis-less."" But Kato does offer a pretty good summary of the proceedings which feel like they drag on for three hours ""Its almost like time slows down."" Both men make half-hearted passes at Britts new secretary played by Cameron Diaz who gets kidded about her ""advanced"" age (36) and spouts references to John Gotti that will seem almost as arcane to the target audience for this movie as the vinyl turntable in the Green Hornets limousine. Plot seems strictly an afterthought in Rogen and screenwriting partner Evan Goldbergs revamping -- trashing really -- of the characters created by George W. Trendle as a follow-up to his ""The Lone Ranger"" (referenced by a poster in Britts bedroom the masked man was originally Britts great-uncle). Christoph Waltz (""Inglourious Basterds"") cashes in on his Oscar win with an embarrassing (and relatively brief) turn as a crime lord with an accent that wanders over several continents and David Harbour hams it up as a crooked DA. Poor Edward James Olmos is cast as the editor of the Daily Sentinel who watches his newsroom systematically demolished in the final half-hour -- probably along with any chance of a ""Green Hornet"" sequel. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next The Posts awards page Read Next The Posts awards page Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 42626 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21540 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 14896 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Jay Chou stars in Columbia Pictures THE GREEN HORNET. Photo Jaimie Trueblood Columbia Pictures Green Hornet review Get the flyswatter 1 / 4 Back to Gallery The Green Hornet Action. Starring Seth Rogen Jay Chou and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Michel Gondry. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It would be too much to expect inspiration in ""The Green Hornet."" Theres nothing here but a concept and a marketing and merchandising strategy at the center of which somebody - oh no - had to come up with an actual movie. No one loved it into existence. No one had a dream. Yet even under these canned conditions sometimes people come up with a way to do it some invigorating new idea. That didnt happen this time. The script based on the old-time radio show was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who wrote the very inspired ""Superbad."" But throughout this movie one gets the sense of clever writers trying to trick the devil while inside the devils pocket by mocking the hackneyed material even as theyre adapting it in earnest. But you cant sell out your integrity while simultaneously maintaining it and so the resulting movie is a mess conceptually weak with no rooting interest and yet with pockets of amusing-enough dialogue. In a similar way Michel Gondry who made ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" surely must know - if we know he has to - that ""The Green Hornet"" is the proverbial sows ear. He cant do anything with it except he can make it look as good as possible and so we get carefully crafted and rather imaginative visuals that show for example how Katos mind slows down time in moments of crisis. But thats not the same as a story with vivid characters who have needs and obstacles to overcome. In place of the basic elements of storytelling the movie offers vacancy. Related Stories The Green Hornet Indeed it feels less like an adaptation of ""The Green Hornet"" than a series of vague gestures on a ""Green Hornet"" theme. Rogen plays Britt a spoiled young playboy who inherits a newspaper and media empire when his father (Tom Wilkinson) dies unexpectedly. He goes out on a drunken tear with Kato (Jay Chou) his fathers former mechanic and they end up rescuing a young couple from a marauding street gang. This is when Britt gets the idea to become a superhero with a twist - to do good deeds while cultivating the public image of a villain an image he promotes in his own newspaper. The real villain meanwhile is an Eastern European mobster who runs all the citys illegal activities. Hes played by Christoph Waltz (""Inglourious Basterds"") who is introduced in the movies one genuinely satisfying scene. Waltz shows up at a nightclub to talk to the owner who has been creating a thriving crystal meth business without giving the mobster his share. Now he asks politely for his tribute upon which the young drug mogul - played by James Franco in a fun uncredited cameo - laughs and tells him that hes old that he isnt scary that he dresses poorly and that hes washed up ... Star image is a wonderful thing. Most of us know Waltz from only one movie. But just from that single exposure even as we see him sinking into his chair and looking smaller and more unsure by the second we know theres only one way this scene is going to end. Nothing in the rest of ""The Green Hornet"" comes near that. The films insurmountable problem is that Rogen and Goldberg are committed to the comic notion that Britt is an idiot. This becomes a box that the character and the movie cant escape. At no point does Britts strategy of doing good while pretending to be evil ever reveal itself to be coherent. On the contrary Rogens Green Hornet doesnt do anybody any good not even by accident - he just wreaks havoc. Britt is a joke a parody of a fatuous rich heir. That provides the occasional laugh as when Britt comes on to his secretary (the long-suffering Cameron Diaz) who loathes him. But when the violence comes who cares if this fatuous ineffectual trouble-making idiot survives? Its strange but even in an action comedy if the audience doesnt care whether the protagonist gets killed its a big problem.

"Green Hornet The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; green-hornet-the ) Green Hornet The (United States 2011) January 13 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in standard (non-IMAX) 3-D. After several years of minimal screen presence superheroes are coming back to multiplexes in 2011 with a vengeance. First out of the starting gate is Michael Gondrys re-imagination of The Green Hornet a property that has been kicking around since the 1930s when it was a radio mainstay. Its recent journey to theaters however has been fraught with director changes script re-writes and recasting. It is perhaps no surprise therefore (especially given the January release date) that The Green Hornet doesnt impress. Even as a mindless diversion its weak. In fact its less of a superhero movie than a vehicle for its lead actor Seth Rogen who might have been better advised not to resurrect The Green Hornet in his own image. The Green Hornet falls into the ""comedy"" end of the superhero spectrum about as far from The Dark Knight as one can get and still claim membership in the same genre. Yet it lacks the wit and darkly satirical edge one finds in efforts like Kick-Ass which at least try to be something more interesting than run-of-the-mill action films with a couple of jokes tossed in. To make matters worse The Green Hornet is a member of that most uninteresting of breeds the origin story. Movies offering tales of superhero beginnings dont have to be uninspired and perfunctory - consider Batman Begins and Iron Man for example - but this one is. The film might have been more engrossing had it not felt obligated to spend half its running time telling us the story of The Green Hornets birth - a narrative to which the term ""overfamiliar"" doesnt do justice. After going through the motions of telling how rich kid Britt Reid (Rogen) and his sidekick Kato (Jay Chou) decide to become masked superheroes posing as criminals The Green Hornet sets up a simple confrontation Reid and Kato against dirty District Attorney Scanlon (David Harbour) and criminal boss Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). Of course since the police believe The Green Hornet is a villain theyre out to get him as well. Aside from Kato Reids only ally is his secretary Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz) who is unaware of his secret until late in the proceedings. Eventually Reid and Chudnofsky square off with predictable results. Most of The Green Hornet feels recycled. Theres not much originality in it even when it comes to Gondrys noted visual flair. Attempts to enliven fight scenes come across as hybrids of The Matrix and Guy Ritchies Sherlock Holmes and the Dick Tracy-like obsession with the ""cool"" look of things causes any fleeting tension to evaporate. Of course with such poorly realized characters it would be difficult to make us care how they escape from the various scrapes in which they find themselves. Some of their ways out are patently ludicrous but I guess thats in keeping with the ""comedy"" element of the movie. We laugh at how stupid it all is. Despite having co-written the screenplay with himself in mind Rogen is miscast. Its probably stating the obvious to observe that the actors range is limited and this appears to be outside of his comfort zone. Theres no attempt to bring out a character; were watching Seth Rogen in a mask. And at times hes uncomfortably close to the asshole Rogen played in Observe and Report. Jay Chou fares better as Kato although his part demands more physicality than general acting ability. He has presence which is important but shows no chemistry whatsoever with Rogen which dispels the critical dynamic duo aspect. Curiously the ""boys will be boys"" tussle between the two reminded me of another Cato - the one from The Pink Panther movies. When Jay Chou and Seth Rogen go at it I flashed back to Burk Kwouk and Peter Sellers. Im reasonably certain that was not Gondrys intention. Cameron Diaz is in the movie although she serves no purpose beyond looking sunny. And if this is how Christoph Waltz chooses to wield the power of his Best Supporting Actor Oscar then hes headed down the winding dead end known as Cuba Gooding Jr. Drive. A comment about the useless 3-D is warranted. The issue here is not eye strain or blurred action but the complete pointlessness of releasing The Green Hornet in 3-D. Significant portions of the film can be watched without the glasses (there are only little things going on in the background) and when the 3-D is fully employed its like watching a Viewmaster slide with different clearly delineated planes. The only plausible explanation for releasing The Green Hornet in 3-D is greed. Any gain to the viewer is negligible but the increase in revenue from surcharges is significant. Although The Green Hornet is a B-grade superhero this cinematic treatment lowers him into the dregs with the likes of The Punisher Ghost Rider and Elektra. Many long-time fans who treasure the radio adventures of the character will be insulted or horrified by what Seth Rogen and Michael Gondry have done. Those without a past affection wont be moved to care. The Green Hornet is mediocre forgettable filmmaking that regardless of how many dimensions it is seen in is more likely to favor catatonia over concentration as the mindless repetition of action clichA(c)s exceeds the point of saturation.

Starring Seth Rogen Jay Chou Christoph Waltz Edward James Olmos David Harbour Cameron Diaz Tom Wilkinson Edward Furlong Chad Coleman Robert Clotworthy Director Michel Gondry Running time 148 Release Opened Jan 14 2011  Editorial Review Harnessing the power of humorBy Dan KoisFriday January 14 2010This morning the unconscious bodies of three pickpockets were found on the front steps of The Washington Posts offices. Safety-pinned to one was an envelope containing the following movie review. Yeah I think you know who I am. Big guy. Wear a mask. I protect the innocent of Gotham from the garbage who pollute the streets with violence. Thats right. Im Batman. But now theres another masked vigilante on the streets. Calls himself the Green Hornet. Hes taking over Los Angeles. Theres a movie out about him right now. Its called ""The Green Hornet."" Obviously. It gets my bat wings all riled up. Let me tell you why. There was a time when movies about superheroes were dark and full of angst. Like ""The Dark Knight."" You know just from the title what that movies gonna be like. Broody. Angsty. Ill be doing a lot of thinking on rooftops you know about justice and whatever. Maybe the girl I love gets blown up. Then this johnny-come-lately shows up. This punk the Green Hornet. His movies fun. Its light-hearted. Its full of jokes. Jokes My enemies tell jokes. Riddles whatnot. Heroes dont tell jokes. Heroes keep it grim. Saving people is serious business. When they made a movie about me they hired Christian Bale to play me. Serious guy. Serious actor. Intense. So who plays the Green Hornet? Seth Rogen. A jokester. A funnyman. A Canadian for Petes sake. Sure they had him do some crunches but still it just points to a real lack of seriousness in this movie. Just as an example when Im weaving the Batmobile through the streets of Gotham with explosions and gunfire on every side I keep my trap shut. Maybe I utter a single quip through gritted teeth after I capture the bad guys with my Batarang. But this Green Hornet guy? ""This is awesome"" he yells. ""Oh man now were in a car chase"" What is this amateur hour? I was prepared to like this Green Hornet kid. We have a lot in common. Take his secret identity. Britt Reids a millionaire playboy which struck a chord although his tastes run less toward tuxedos and fine art and more toward parties drenched in beer and Silly String. Like a certain superhero I know he loses a parent unexpectedly; when his father played by Tom Wilkinson dies Britt inherits his mansion his garage full of luxury cars and the newspaper he edited for years. (Yeah I thought newspaper editors drove Hondas not Rolls-Royces but thats Hollywood I guess.) But does Britt Reid seethe about the death of his father? Is he filled with rage? No He resented the old man so he saws the head off his dads memorial statue. What kind of hero does that? Look I will grudgingly admit that much of the movie was really funny. Sure I didnt laugh - in lieu of laughter I emit a harsh sound like a dogs cough - but all around me the crowd really seemed to be enjoying themselves. Rogen and Jay Chou the charismatic Taiwanese pop star who plays Britts partner Kato have real chemistry. The movie somehow manages not to marginalize or insult Kato a character who in the early ""Hornet"" radio serials was something of an offensive Asian caricature. (What Ive been thinking about getting a sidekick so I did some research.) In fact Katos often the best part of the movie. Britt calls him a ""human Swiss army knife"" and hes right; Kato is not a sidekick but a fully formed hero whos full of surprises. And the gadgets he develops for the Hornets sweet ride (a souped-up 65 Chrysler Imperial respect) are pretty sweet. Ive been thinking the Batmobile could use a fax machine and a turntable. But really I just want to make it clear that I am personally offended that someone would make a silly superhero movie. Thats unacceptable. They couldnt even get a dark and complicated director such as Christopher Nolan to direct it; instead its directed by Michel Gondry. Michel Gondry The Frenchman who directed ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and those White Stripes videos How is that appropriate? True some of the handmade effects in which Gondry specializes work well in ""The Green Hornet"" dramatizing how Kato for instance can beat five guys up at once. And I guess that maybe Gondrys easygoing comic spirit is a better match for a movie like this than Nolan who proved triumphantly with ""Inception"" that you can make a gigantic hit movie that contains zero jokes. (I loved it I saw it four times and asked Lucius Fox to start developing that dream technology for Wayne Industries.) And what about the villains? My most recent nemesis was a crazed murderer whose ruthless anti-philosophy shook me and the city to the very core. Chudnofsky the villain in ""The Green Hornet"" - played by Christoph Waltz - is having a midlife crisis. Thats not serious Sigh. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Or in this case a joke. Well let me employ sarcasm Well done Seth Rogen and Michel Gondry. You made a superhero movie for people who thought ""The Dark Knight"" needed to lighten up. Thats so funny I forgot to laugh. No seriously I forgot to laugh. I actually dont know how.

The Green Hornet reviewed Michel Gondry Seth Rogen and Jay Chou attempt a superhero movie. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 13 2011 625 PM The Green Hornet Michel Gondry versus the superhero movie. By Dana Stevens Jay Chou and Seth Rogen in The Green Hornet The Green Hornet (Sony Pictures) director Michel Gondrys first foray into mainstream action filmmaking presents a good test case for the auteur theory. Though hes made only one truly great film so far the 2004 sci-fi-fantasy/romance Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Gondry is nothing if not an ""author"" a filmmaker possessed of an unmistakable personal style. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. His two subsequent movies The Science of Sleep and Be Kind Rewind were slighter and spottier than Eternal Sunshine.(Suggesting that Gondry may be at his best when paired with the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who also scripted his nuttily endearing debut feature Human Nature.) But all Gondrys films (not to mention his many remarkable music videos) share a strong sense of visual whimsy and an interest in the spectacle of people at play. His protagonists are children trapped in adult bodies sometimes literally (as when Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine finds himself a baby again being bathed in the sink by his mother) and always figuratively. In The Science of Sleep Gael Garcia Bernal slept on spaceship sheets and struggled to exit his fantasy world long enough to connect with his entrancing new neighbor played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. And Be Kind Rewinds buddy heroes (Jack Black and Mos Def) gleefully and incompetently re-created Hollywood blockbusters using only an old VHS camera. Advertisement That was quite a long and pensive windup for a 3-D movie about two masked dudes fighting crime in a tricked-out Imperial Crown.  But as a Gondry fan I found it impossible to sit through The Green Hornet without trying to discern the Gondry touches amid the conventional action-movie hardware. And those touches did appear at times--in the playful early scenes between the two self-invented crimestoppers or an action montage niftily choreographed across multiple split screens or the recurrent motif of drifting deep-red roses. But sadly these small bursts of beauty seemed so at odds with the movies general crushing mediocrity that they were like quickly squelched protests against it. Theres a sense watching The Green Hornet that the movie really wants to be something other than a dumb big 3-D superhero movie but for whatever reason market pressure writerly indiscipline lack of imagination?--it just cant. Is Gondry trying to blink us out a message? The Green Hornet adapts a character from a 1930s radio serial via a 60s TV show that costarred Bruce Lee. But the period it feels most indebted to is the 80s big rollicking tongue-in-cheek blockbusters like Lethal Weapon and Ghostbusters the kind of films the Be Kind Rewind boys were interested in remaking. Britt Reid (Seth Rogen who also co-wrote the script) is a callow playboy the absurdly rich son of a newspaper magnate (Tom Wilkinson) who dies mysteriously of a lethal bee sting. Britt far too lazy and dumb to run a newspaper instead begins killing time with Kato (the Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou) his late fathers mechanic and designated cappuccino-maker. As they discover their shared love of customized vehicles sleeping-gas-dispersing guns and general cool superhero stuff Britt and Kato make a pact to cruise Los Angeles at night pretending to be bad guys while secretly attempting to bust up the crime ring of gang lord Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz in a role thats a pale shadow of his suave supervillain in Inglourious Basterds). Eventually Britts hypercompetent assistant at the daily paper Lenore (Cameron Diaz) intervenes to help the boys rough out some basics of criminal psychology. But Kato and Britt have some power issues to work through--not least that the only one of them who has any real engineering or crime-fighting acumen (Kato) is the hired servant of the other (Britt). This profoundly inequitable relationship leads to fistfights and fallings-out and intense rivalry for Lenores affections--despite the fact that shes demonstrably uninterested in either one of them. Is Gondry aware that hes making a film about both white male privilege and sexual harassment in the workplace? At moments he seems to be. Kato and Britt discuss their master-servant dynamic--and less explicitly the racial difference that underlies it--in several scenes but the fundamental injustice of their partnership is never satisfactorily addressed. And Britt treats Lenore with a leering disrespect that in real life would be legally actionable. In the end The Green Hornet scripted by Seth Rogen and his writing partner Evan Goldberg (who also collaborated on Superbad and Pineapple Express) is too fragmented and self-indulgent to be about anything at all or indeed even to offer much fun. Seth Rogen must be a master at creating a Rat Pack-like atmosphere of dudely camaraderie on set because in movie after movie hes given a huge amount of creative control. While he and Goldberg have proven their gift for writing amiable guy-on-guy repartee they havent yet been challenged to structure a story and The Green Hornet doesnt suggest theyre about to start challenging themselves. This movieis about a pampered arrogant young man who rushes to don a crusader mask hes nowhere near ready to fill. Rogen--whos far from untalented both as an actor and a writer--should take care that the films story doesnt become his autobiography. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

The question--which rises to the level of an industrial mystery--is trying to do what? Turn a dumb concept into a smart entertainment? Save a dim production by pouring a fortune into stupid effects? (The budget was reportedly as high as 130 million.) Kill the special-effects industry by doing a parody of its excesses? The effect of those effects and of the cheesy 3-D process pasted on as an afterthought is simply numbing. The films only unqualified success is the end title sequence--because its genuinely stylish because it looks like it was shot in genuine 3-D and most of all because its the end. Watch a scene from The Green Hornet starring Seth Rogen and Cameron Diaz. Courtesy Sony Pictures. The initial notion must have been a retro goof on the theme of the Green Hornet a masked vigilante who with his valet/sidekick Kato first entered American popular culture via a radio series in the 1930s. (The semisuperhero is the alter ego of a newspaper publisher named Britt Reid.) And why not? Theres nothing sacred about the Hornet; indeed theres never been anything particularly distinctive about him not on the radio or in any of his subsequent iterations in comic books and on TV. But the notion became a concept when Seth Rogen was hired to play the venerable crime fighter--not only to play him but to write the script with his longtime friend and collaborator Evan Goldberg and to produce the film. (Michel Gondry was the director.) Mr. Rogen is a funny man--he was terrific in ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad""--with a distinctive voice that mingles chortle yodel and gargle. None of his comic chops however could fill the void at the center of the character he chose to inflict on himself. In keeping with the stars persona Britt Reid is now a doofus slacker an amiable goon a dim-bulb rich kid who doesnt have a clue what to do with his inherited money or his shallow life. The brains of his operation belong to Kato who is now less of a valet and more of a mechanical and electronic genius and kung-fu virtuoso plus a casual sorcerer who can freeze time. (The movie freezes time too. At 119 minutes it seems all but endless.) ENLARGE Seth Rogen as Britt Reid aka the Green Hornet and Jay Chou as his valet and sidekick Kato flanking Black Beauty in The Green Hornet. Columbia Pictures Kato is played with deadpan nonchalance by the Taiwanese actor Jay Chou who is very entertaining at the outset. So is Christoph Waltz who brings to the role of the bad guy Chudnofsky the melange of sweet reason and Stygian evil that he pioneered in ""Inglourious Basterds."" Yet the brains of the script operation are missing in action or buried beneath it. Who cares about the bumbling hero even when he starts to think that he knows what hes doing? Why care about a movie that disses its source material without finding a good reason for having used it in the first place? Its pleasantly silly when in the absence of any other motivation Britt says to Kato ""Lets do something crazy"" and off they go to decapitate a statue of Britts late father. Its mildly amusing that Britt keeps referring with winks and nods to their implicitly gay relationship. ""Girls are such a drag Kato. Thank God we have each other."" They also have Cameron Diaz to woo. She plays a journalism-school graduate--lets hear it for serious practitioners of the profession--who although hired as a secretary has a vision of Britts paper that he lacks. Still pitifully little comes of the male rivalry or her presence. In this film nothing comes to anything but the chaos of special effects the usual explosions and subwoofer blasts; general-issue fireballs; crazed car chases; vehicles going airborne; bullets spewing from retractible machine guns mounted on the hood of Black Beauty the Green Hornets car an old Chrysler Imperial sedan gussied up with a new grille and so heavily loaded with assorted weapons that it could pass for a technical in Somalia. And oh the awful photography Not only the pseudo 3-D with its steep light loss through Polaroid glasses but the grungy palette and bleached-out colors. How could such a costly production look so crummy? Dont ask me. I started off by saying it was mysterious.  Special effects can be glorious (from ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" through ""Star Wars"" to Pixar and ""Avatar"") as well as good bad or indifferent. What they always prove to be is challenging--otherwise they wouldnt be special--and draining. A reminder of how that challenge can affect another medium turned up on the cover of this weeks New Yorker magazine--a cartoon showing a hospital ward full of Spider-Men in various states of orthopedic extremis. The wryly humorous reference was to injuries recently sustained by performers in ""Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark"" the Broadway musical that has embraced the allure of cinematic effects with unprecedented fervor and has spent unprecedented--for a stage show--amounts of money in the process. As a professional moviegoer I often feel Im drowning in the FX tide; just when I thought Id recovered from ""Tron Legacy"" along came ""The Green Hornet."" As a theatergoer though I enjoy adventurous stagecraft so I couldnt resist the chance to see a Spidey matinee. (No glasses required every member of the cast appears in genuine 3-D.) Since this ""Spider-Man"" continues to play in previews and since my colleague Terry Teachout the Journals theater critic wont publish his review until after the official opening Ill confine myself to noting what everyone who has followed the shows development already knows the aerial sequences are remarkable even if Spidey and his nemesis the Green Goblin fly around the theater on wires that the Spider-Man movies rendered invisible; and the mechanisms that produce various effects dont always work. One famously balky prop is a giant cocoon that entraps the heroine Mary Jane. It got stuck for a while during the performance I attended but it also bestowed the gift of a memorable image for FX-dependent movies not to mention live shows that seek to emulate them--productions trapped in a cocoon of technology. That entrapment is most obvious in a fiasco like ""The Green Hornet"" which took refuge in technology as a means of averting box-office failure. What can never be measured on screen though is the extent to which a films special effects have drained the filmmakers energy distracting them from fundamental concerns of storytelling performance and pace. And that drainage comes with the FX territory. A stuck cocoon on stage is kids stuff compared to the things that can and do go wrong in the movie industry with todays immensely complicated visual wizardry. This is not to say the movies should go back to painted scenery and handmade models standing in for flying saucers. Who doesnt thrill to special effects when they go well? Even when they go incomparably well though effects cant carry a film on their own. ""Avatar"" or the ""Toy Story"" trilogy stand as the signal achievements they are because they use technology in the service of their narratives. Its also worth noting that digital manipulation ranged from invisible to nonexistent in two of last years finest feature films ""The Social Network"" and ""The Kings Speech."" Drama remains the most special effect. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) Seth Rogen first scored on the big screen in Judd Apatows raunchy and endearing comedy about Andy Stitzer a shy guy played by Steve Carell who is at the age of you-know-what still a you-know-what until he finally does you-know-what then falls in love. Mr. Rogen who plays Cal a tattooed sexaholic was all of 23 years old and surrounded by a fine cast that included Catherine Keener as the object of Andys love plus Paul Rudd Jane Lynch Romany Malco Elizabeth Banks and Leslie Mann. Messrs. Apatow and Carell wrote the script. In the Bedroom (2001) Tom Wilkinson who has a smallish role in ""The Green Hornet"" as Britt Reids late unlamented father is an avenging father in Todd Fields wonderful debut feature; the director and Rob Festinger adapted the screenplay from a story by the late Andre Dubus. Mr. Wilkinson is Matt Fowler a doctor with a solid practice in a picturesque town on the coast of Maine. Sissy Spacek is his wife Ruth Fowler. Their son Frank is played by Nick Stahl. Marisa Tomei is Natalie an older and not-quite-divorced single mother with whom Frank has a fateful affair. In Her Shoes (2005) Cameron Diaz is sexy sluttish Maggie whose life is in ruins and Toni Collette is Rose Maggies older plain-Jane sister a prosperous lawyer who keeps picking up the pieces. The film directed by Curtis Hanson is manipulative but confidently so and improbably affecting. Nothing in Ms. Diazs career foreshadowed this beautiful performance. Her Maggie is a vivid creature body and soul a perpetually adolescent party girl coming slowly to understand that the partys over. Shirley MacLaine is Ella the sisters long-lost grandmother. Susannah Grant adapted the screenplay from Jennifer Weiners comic novel. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Hard to think of a more mystifying mismatch of filmmaker and material.Seth Rogen cowrote and costars in the movie that aims for irreverence and settles for irrelevance. He plays Britt Reid spoiled rich kid who inherits Daddys publishing empire when the old man (Tom Wilkinson) passes away.As with the equally misbegotten 1960s TV show based on George Trendles 1930s radio series the only memorable aspects of The Green Hornet are Britt Reids sidekick Kato and his ride a pimped-out 1966 Chrysler Imperial the Black Beauty.Bruce Lee was the TV Kato; Taiwan pop star Jay Chou Buster Keaton in a Beatles haircut is the movie Kato an imaginative mechanic and deft martial artist who is both brains and muscle of the duo. (""Youre a human Swiss army knife"" Britt says to him.)The movies one nice conceit is that bombastic Britt egomaniac and credit hog by the middle of the film concedes that Kato is his equal and by the end probably his superior.(When Kung Fu Hustle director Stephen Chow was attached to direct the movie he wanted Kato to implant a microchip in Britts brain and operate him with a joystick. Thats a better comic idea than anything here.)One night as Britt and Kato go out for a joyride they become accidental do-gooders when they save innocents from gangbangers. To battle the crime wave crashing L.A.s shores they invent the alter ego of ""Green Hornet"" a good guy the public believes is a bad guy.As the publisher of the Daily Sentinel boorish Britt orders his editors to write about the Hornets exploits. This gets the attention of Chudnowsky (Christoph Waltz) a Russian druglord who thinks the Hornet is trespassing on his turf.The enterprising Waltz (who shares an amusing scene with an unbilled James Franco at the beginning of the film) has little to do. Cameron Diaz as Lenore Britts Gal Friday has even less.The plot mechanics overwhelm Gondry who fails to put his stamp on the material and rein in Rogen. Of the shambling screenplay one might well ask Seth where is thy sting?Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In The Green Hornet a long-in-the-works feature-film outing for the venerable radio/film-serial/television/comic-book character Seth Rogen plays a shiftless playboy who more or less on a lark embarks on a career as a crimefighter. He almost immediately recognizes hes in over his head then has to fake his way through his new job anyway. Its easy to imagine the filmmakers feeling much the same way. Rogen and creative partner Evan Goldberg wrote the script; Michel Gondry at his best a crafter of profound visually striking whimsy provided the direction. Nothing in the teams collective filmography suggested theyd be particularly suited to make a big action movie and the lumpy results suggest they never grew comfortable in those roles. Like their onscreen hero they get the job done but leave a mess in their wake. Still better a mess with personality than a paint-by-numbers job even if the personalities rarely work together. Gondrys imaginative touches are best felt in a handful of inspired scenes particularly an early fight sequence an inventive split-screen interruption and the handmade quality of the Hornets gadgets. Rogen meanwhile brings his usual unstable combination of teddy-bear vulnerability and caustic distance. Theyre two intriguing tastes that dont always taste great together but any clash of sensibilities between director and star still feels less awkward than Rogens many scenes with his incarnation of the Green Hornets Kato as played by Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou. Chou has an undeniable screen presence and a painfully shaky grasp of English pronunciation but he at least gets off better than Cameron Diaz whos mostly on hand as an object for Rogens leering. When the film works its fun but it seldom tops an opening scene in which Christoph Waltz reestablishes his top-dog status by taking on a young challenger (an unbilled James Franco) who critiques the absence of flair in Waltzs supervillainy. Gondry plays the scene as pure comedy and its the last unconfused moment he manages before plunging into a buddy comedy in which the buddies have no chemistry and an action film where the best moments feel more thrilling in concept than execution. Its a strange shapeless rarely satisfying but generally amiable movie in which everyone appears to be faking it as they go along and almost--almost--getting away with it.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 13 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Wednesday May 15 2013 533PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Well it might have worked. There are moments though not exactly whole scenes in the new Seth Rogen film The Green Hornet when we get a glimpse of how this long-gestating movie might have been a kick a refreshing change from the ponderously self-important superhero movies of the past decade.The high point might be the opening scene before the stars arrive on screen. Christoph Waltz the suave villain of Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds plays Los Angeless meanest drug dealer and villain facing a middle-aged crisis as well as a swaggering young upstart (a sneak cameo by a Spider-Man alumnus and one of Seth Rogens former co-stars). The silly but deftly turned dialogue is enough to raise hopes that a genre overdue for a smart spoofing is about to get its due. Movies The Green Hornet The official trailer The Green Hornet is directed by Michel Gondry known for his playful philosophical sensibility ( The Science of Sleep Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). Though he was first attached to the film back in the nineties since then it has been associated with a string of different directors stars and concepts. To its credit the studio didnt go the conventional route.Gondrys improbable creative partner here is writer-actor Seth Rogen ( Superbad Pineapple Express) the breakout star of the Judd Apatow school of raunchy-but-amiable bromances who serves here not only as the star but co-writer and executive producer with his creative partner Evan Goldberg.Instead of magical creative synergy what happens here feels sad. Rather than a meeting of talents we get a stand-off an ungainly stop-and-start compromise between action and comedy Juvenile verbal jousting bombastic action more juvenile humour typically recapping what just happened. Gondry shows little evidence of his usually distinctive visual style falling into the slick antic style of mediocre action movies and the 3-D effects added in post-production contribute little beyond an increase in the ticket prices.The story is based on a 1930s radio show conceived by Lone Ranger creator George Trendle which subsequently became a comic book a couple of movie serials and a one-season television show that introduced Bruce Lee to Western audiences in the 1960s. The role of the Green Hornet Britt Reid the heir to a Los Angeles publishing fortune has been refitted for Rogens hard-partying slacker persona.When his harsh father (Tom Wilkinson) dies suddenly Britt is in theory compelled to grow up and accept adult responsibility using the paper to fight for justice in a city mired in crime and corruption. Instead he prefers to hang out with his dads coffee-maker and ingenious mechanic Kato (Taiwanese pop star and actor Jay Chou) in his old mans tricked-out black Chrysler Imperial. Along the way they can pose as bad guys in order to infiltrate the world of real bad guys and enjoy a secret fantasy life as masked vigilantes.Theres the germ of a good idea here as Rogen and Goldbergs script chooses not to ignore the childish wish-fulfilment aspect of superhero stories. But instead of exploring arrested development it celebrates it. The one-note joke here is that theres a major discrepancy between the would-be superhero the ungainly Rogen as the Green Hornet and his far more capable and cooler sidekick. It gets repeated endlessly.Kato who knows martial arts and has special vision that slows down the action (the brief effective use of 3-D) is clearly the genius while Britt is the self-deluded front man. As a co-star Chou is sleekly handsome and enough of a pop star to help sell the movie in Asia but his English is sometimes hard to understand. Rogen who while slimmed down sticks to his familiar role as the wisecracking observer.We wait and wait for this relationship to evolve. Instead we have too much dull banter about the proper roles of heroes and sidekicks and mocking the latently homo-erotic relationship between the two (""No tights"" they agree.). By the time The Green Hornet collapses into a mess of hackneyed car chases and flying glass and bullets it feels less like the promised irreverent take on the superhero genre and more like the latest iteration of the Rush Hour movies.The Green HornetDirected by Michel GondryWritten by Seth Rogen and Evan GoldbergStarring Seth Rogen Jay Chou and Cameron DiazClassification PG Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey More Related to this Story New Canadian film explores the stylish paradoxes of Bruce Lee Green Hornets Black Beauty vs. the Batmobile Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Comments click to enlarge The Green Hornet Video Rated PG-13  119 minutes  2011 Christoph Waltz makes a fine supervillain at the start of this action comedy which revives the old 60s TV series with Bruce Lee. But writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg dont give him much to do focusing instead on tired buddy comedy between the spoiled publishing scion Britt Reid (Rogen) and his not-so-loyal servant Kato (Jay Chou). The gags turn on the irony that Kato became the cult hero of the series and Rogen plays the Green Hornet as an enthusiastic buffoon along for the ride; when he starts throwing punches you cant quite buy it. Michel Gondry (Be Kind Rewind The Science of Sleep) is an odd choice to direct an action film and the movie lopes along from one half-baked scene to the next interrupted on occasion by car-porn sequences involving the heros luminous limo the Black Beauty.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Green Hornet   (out of four) Stars Seth Rogen Jay Chou Cameron Diaz Christoph Waltz Tom WilkinsonDirector Michel GondryDistributor Sony PicturesRating PG-13 for sequences of violent action language sensuality and drug contentRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesOpens at midnight Thursday in select cities; nationwide Friday O Green Hornet where is thy cinematic sting? By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Green Hornet is not exactly a B movie but lots of people are laid waste by falling objects in surprisingly old-school ways. Even its flurry of CGI activity stylized slow-motion shots and high-tech gadgetry offers little payoff despite an eclectic cast. This current iteration of the old radio and TV show stars Seth Rogen and Taiwanese singer/musician/actor Jay Chou as the masked vigilante Green Hornet and his sidekick Kato. The woman they both halfheartedly desire is Lenore blandly played by Cameron Diaz. Theres not much chemistry among any of the trio. But there are more unimaginative car crashes explosions and other acts of generic mayhem in this movie than bees around a sticky jelly doughnut. This misguided crime-fighting update shoots for silly laughs but only occasionally lands them. As directed by Michel Gondry Hornets visuals have a few pixilated flourishes. But the production design is more cluttered than eye-catching and the near-pointless use of 3-D simply muddies the photography. Rogen and writing partner Evan Goldberg are responsible for the storys reboot with a disjointed screenplay and jokes haphazardly thrown around in the hope that some will stick. Rogens obnoxious overgrown rich kid Britt Reid is unconvincing as any superhero. And while Chou has the slick moves and good looks needed for his skilled sidekick Kato his halting delivery often impedes their patter. Where the original Britt was a debonair publisher by day and a crime fighter by night Rogens version is just a spoiled party animal with no involvement in his fathers news empire until his dads death. The elder Reid is played imperiously by Tom Wilkinson (The Ghostwriter) a mystifying choice by a talented actor. Equally hard to comprehend is why supporting-actor Oscar winner Christoph Waltz (the unforgettable polyglot Nazi in Inglourious Basterds) would take the part of a caricatured crime boss. It must be the Oscar curse at work. The involvement of impressive actors may be the result of the lure of director Gondry whose resume includes Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But that collaboration with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was far more ingenious. Hornet and Kato cruise the crime-choked streets of Los Angeles in a tricked-out 1965 black Chrysler looking for bad guys to bash. (They also take down some law enforcers in the process as the police chase them but such collateral damage gets lost amid the frenetic shtick.) The Hornet is mostly a hapless loudmouth. Its Katos Matrix-inspired time-slowing vision and his stealthy martial arts moves that come closest to dynamic. On the other end of the excitement spectrum is Diazs Lenore Britts temporary secretary who were supposed to believe is an expert criminologist with a sage overview of the current state of journalism. Edward James Olmos brings so much dignity to his newspaper editor role that he seems to be in another movie. James Francos cameo is the films funniest sequence. Some of the car gadgetry Katos specialty looks cool but too much 3-D time is spent on splintering windshields windows and sundry reflective surfaces. The Green Hornet is otherwise colorless numbing and sluggishly paced. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

"Review Green Hornet where is thy sting? | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesReview Green Hornet where is thy sting?The Green Hornet is a too-clever-by-half attempt to both satirize and celebrate the superhero genre.Seth Rogen right and Jay Chou ham it up in The Green Hornet.  (JAIMIE TRUEBLOOD / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 13 2011The Green Hornet(out of 4)Starring Seth Rogen Jay Chou Christoph Waltz and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Michel Gondry. 119 minutes. At major theatres. PGA wiser mind than mine once observed that the harder a comic tries to be funny the more the joke is on him.And thats only half the problem with Seth Rogen and his stingless The Green Hornet a too-clever-by-half attempt to both satirize and celebrate the superhero genre.Article Continued BelowYou can see where the schlubby Canuck comic and his co-writer Evan Goldberg are coming from. Tired of the usual heroic cliches and time-wasting exposition (who cares how they make their damned suits?) they set out to mock the whole process.Yet at the same time they cant resist buying into the superhero mythology to the point where Rogen dropped a bundle of poundage so he wouldnt look completely ridiculous as the green-obsessed title vigilante. We also get the standard myth-spinning razzmatazz which still feels like work even when its being played for supposed laughs. Reid fusses about finding the right name (""The Green Bee"" just doesnt work) getting the right car (a sleek black Chrysler Imperial from the good ol gas-guzzling days) and establishing motivation (the playboy needs to prove that his stern dead papa was wrong about him).Rogen totally digs being the Green Hornet which is possibly the strangest of all super dudes for him to play. Originally a 1930 radio serial and a 1960s TV show the real Green Hornet was the straightest of the straight men an enigma in fedora and trenchcoat who made Dragnets Jack Webb (""Just the facts maam"") seem a party animal in comparison.That fact that Rogens Green Hornet actually is a party animal -- his real identity is spoiled L.A. newspaper heir Britt Reid who doesnt even read -- only makes the matter all the more confusing.Meanwhile Reids trusty assistant Kato played by Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou obviously didnt get the memo about the film being a parody. He plays the conventional superhero sidekick as skilled with kung-fu and stunt-car driving as he is with making a mean morning latte. As predictable as a fortune cookie he comes perilously close to a racist Asian stereotype.Chou does all the heavy lifting both literally and dramatically while Rogen cracks wise and takes all the credit and that combo never really clicks. Its just one of the films many gags that attempt to run but stumble instead.Too much of the movie is spent trying to make Rogen look good even when hes supposed to look silly as witness his preening to Coolios 1990s rap anthem ""Gangstas Paradise.""You can imagine Rogen and his frequent accomplice Goldberg -- the pair also share executive producer credits -- excitedly beginning their writing sessions with ""Wouldnt it be cool if ...""Putting Michel Gondry in charge of direction was another out-there idea that equally fails to pay dividends. The free-floating Gondry is great when hes directing strong characters in films of pure emotion and fantasy -- his Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the best films of the past decade -- but hes absolutely hopeless at material closer to ground. The French fabulist made a mash of the meta-humor of Be Kind Rewind and hes equally lost with The Green Hornet where even the action sequences lack flair -- including the slo-mo previews of violence to come a direct steal from Sherlock Holmes.Gondrys cluelessness is most apparent in his handling of co-stars Christoph Waltz and Cameron Diaz.Waltz the breakout fascist of Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds is completely wasted in the subplot role of L.A. crimelord Chudnofsky who suffers from esteem issues. The best gag that Rogen and Goldberg could think up for Waltz apart from his ludicrous Austrian-Bronx accent? Its his frustration with people constantly getting his name wrong. Insert weak chuckle here.But Waltz seems positively indulged when you consider how Diazs ample comic talents are frittered away. As Lenore Case an ace reporter forced to toil as Reids personal secretary shes reduced to simply acting outraged whenever the slobbering Reid hits upon her.Most ludicrous of all is the supposed main plot of The Green Hornet which tilts around a scheme to stop The Daily Sentinel from printing crime news so the populace would remain happily ignorant of the crime spree raging through L.A. thus allowing criminals unfettered lawlessness. Anyone ever hear of radio TV or that other groovy invention the Internet? Was this supposed to be funny?Its very difficult to wring mirth from a semi-serious character like Britt Reid although Gondrys Eternal Sunshine star Jim Carrey likely could have pulled it off with his gift for physical humor (which Rogen lacks).Far better would have been for all concerned to make The Green Hornet a much darker and dramatic affair much like Tim Burton did with Michael Keaton in their 1989 rebirth of Batman. It would actually be interesting to see a properly done treatment of the emerald avenger.As Rogen and Gondry now realize all too well its hard to be klutzy and cool at the same time especially when youre not sure why youre doing it in the first place.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Superhero revival more lead than lark - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Superhero revival more lead than larkThe Green Hornet a 2 starsJanuary 13 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticSlipping into a funk while watching half of Los Angeles get shot up in the second half of ""The Green Hornet"" I was struck by the sheer unluckiness of this films timing. In the wake of last weekends massacre in Tucson its suddenly temporarily a little harder to laugh off scene after scene of obsessive gun fetishization and mass slaughter in a superhero vigilante lark. Im as much of a hypocrite as any moviegoer on the issue of diversionary screen violence. Ive lapped up more than my share. I appreciate the comic impulse behind this 120 million bauble; director Michel Gondrys action comedy at least has the nerve to seek out more comedy than action. But the script by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg tailored for Rogen in the title role rides a streak of blase raunch and overscaled action smack into a series of walls each spray-painted with phrases beginning with ""Too."" Too much. Too numbing. Too coy. And ultimately too violent. This is a PG-13 picture very close to R territory. By the time the underworld villain played by Christoph Waltz of ""Inglourious Basterds"" gets his eyes gouged out and the auxiliary villain (no spoilers) is impaled by a falling car the fun has been sidelined altogether. Too bad because there are some grace notes along the way. Unlike Batman or Superman The Green Hornet is a niche figure with which contemporary filmmakers can do whatever they like. Born on Depression-era radio picked up for the movies then for a short-lived 60s TV series co-starring Bruce Lee as Kato he is a masked avenger with a callow streak. Gondrys sense of the fantastic mixed with his attention to everyday reality has led in previous projects to the glory that is ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" in addition to the more mixed but stimulating ""Science of Sleep"" and "" Be Kind Rewind."" Gondry was pegged to direct ""The Green Hornet"" years ago in an earlier incarnation; his time eventually came and with Rogen aboard a straightforward predictable result was virtually un-guaranteed. Rogen and Goldberg who wrote ""Superbad"" when they were still teenagers retool ""The Green Hornet"" for a world overpopulated with superheroes and superhero movies. Britt Reid (Rogen) is the playboy son of an L.A. newspaper baron ( Tom Wilkinson) who dies by bee sting leaving Britt in charge. Because he has nothing better to do -- the script works more by whim and caprice than compelling plotting -- he teams up with one of his fathers employees (Jay Chou waging a touching occasionally decipherable struggle with English) to become the Green Hornet aided by faithful patronized sidekick Kato. As they clean up the local scuzzy drug trade and stoke the ire of Waltzs facetiously psychopathic bad guy these two bicker over Britts temporary secretary ( Cameron Diaz in a role that makes you realize how valuable Gwyneth Paltrow was in the first ""Iron Man"" by comparison) and eventually beat each other up in a scene as long and nearly as vicious as the melees in "" Pineapple Express"" an earlier Rogen/Goldberg script. This is where the movie takes a bad turn and never recovers. What works here? The little things. When Kato invents a ""gas bomb"" that puts its victims to sleep the first version knocks out Britt for a full 11 days (he wakes up with a considerable beard). Thats funny. Its funny to see Kato in his underfurnished studio apartment updating his resume after his battle with Britt. The car -- the tricked-out Black Beauty with machine guns embedded in the door frames and an ancient LP player for atmosphere -- looks fantastic. But Gondrys action sequences tend toward the lengthy and the shapeless. The postproduction 3-D is just about useless. And the enjoyment one gets from the body count the scenes of people being crushed pummeled or machine-gunned well...this isnt the week for ""The Green Hornet"" at least for me. The film is pretty messed-up even without a recent tragic event hanging over its head. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of violent action language sensuality and drug content) Cast Seth Rogen (Britt Reid); Jay Chou (Kato); Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz); Christoph Waltz (Chudnofsky); Edward James Olmos (Axford); David Harbour (Scanlon); Tom Wilkinson (James Reid) Credits Directed by Michel Gondry; written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg; produced by Neal H.

The Green Hornet Fair Director Michel Gondry. Cast Seth Rogen Jay Chou Cameron Diaz. Rating PG-13 for sequences of violent action language sensuality and drug content. Guide to this weeks new movie releases Movies based on comic books Superheroes we love Patience brought Green Hornet to screen Seth Rogen amazed by insane Hornet budget Certainly Seth Rogens presence alone as the title character (he also co-wrote the script) makes it unusual. Were used to seeing him as a happy-go-lucky slacker goof not a mask-wearing crime fighter. Here he plays . . . a happy-go-lucky slacker goof of a mask-wearing crime fighter. Hes stuck in the middle of his usual persona and what we expect of comic-book heroes. >> Guide to this weeks new movie releases Aside from the collapse in logic story and quality at the end of director Michel Gondrys film this is its other problem It cant decide what it wants to be so it resides somewhere between the cool veneer of ""Iron Man"" and the out-and-out lunacy of ""Kick-Ass."" This is not an especially good place to be. Rogen plays Britt Reid the spoiled son of James Reid (Tom Wilkinson who doesnt stick around long enough sadly) an old-time titanlike publisher of the Daily Sentinel in Los Angeles whose philosophy is evident when he is punishing a young Britt who has tried to break up a fight at school ""Trying doesnt matter when you always fail."" Nice. When the elder Reid dies of an allergic reaction to a bee sting - nothing suspicious about that no sir - his media empire falls to Reid whose only association with journalism is to show up in the gossip section of his dads paper drunk or drunker. He is at first content to leave the papers operations to his fathers trusted right-hand man Axford (Edward James Olmos). But after a drinking session with his fathers mechanic and coffee maker Kato (Jay Chou) which ends with them saving a couple from a marauding gang Britt hits upon an idea Lets fight crime Hes like a dissipated Andy Hardy. Thats a pretty intriguing origination story - downing a few beers and deciding to be a hero. Britts plan is that they will be good guys pretending to be bad guys while actually fighting bad guys following some sort of logic hes come up with. Meanwhile Britt takes over control of the paper - so that he can run more Green Hornet stories. He also hires Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz) a crime buff as his secretary to research - and since Britt is clueless help suggest - where the Green Hornet might strike next. (She was a journalism major.) Eventually Britt and Kato attract the attention of the citys resident crime lord with the universally ridiculed name of Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz pretty much defining ""slumming"") whom they must deal with. But first they have to work out their own hero-sidekick issues which they attempt to do by way of a fight that Gondry draws out as with other action sequences far too long. There are some nice bits like how Britt and Kato stop to get gas for the supercool car Kato builds - in costume. And David Harbour has some funny lines as a crooked district attorney. But the story falls apart while Gondry ratchets up the silly action so far over the top the structure of the film cant support it. It cant help but feel like a disappointment leaving ""The Green Hornet"" as an interesting idea that goes seriously wrong and not much else. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Strong men have crumbled attempting to advance the story of the titular masked vigilante transforming him from an unironic 1930s radio personality and briefly a 1960s TV diversion (during which the martial-arts phenom Bruce Lee played sidekick/driver Kato) to a movie character suited to our wised-up superhero-sated times. Now after a long development-hell history during which George Clooney and Kevin Smith (among others) separately came and went as star and director Seth Rogen bellows barges and stumbles in. If unmodulated decibel level and childish dorkish energy alone could lower a citys crime rate then consider the cartoon bad guys of cartoon Los Angeles flattened. Both in nighttime drag and in his daytime identity as newspaper publisher Britt Reid Rogens Green Hornet is the first movie superhero to whom an otherwise grateful populace begs to say Ssshhhhhh. Not so loud. I suspect the newest Hornet thinks hes got to shout because theres so much tonal cacophony in this production directed with random visual tricks by Michel Gondry the music-video stylist who made Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. While Rogen brays Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou struggles with his newly learned English as Kato. (Once upon a time Jet Li was booked for the role.) As Reids brainy-beauty secretary Lenore Cameron Diaz struggles to fit in with a production that has no use for girls. And in a riff on his Oscar-winning performance as Nazi Hans Landa Inglourious Basterds invaluable Christoph Waltz plays an over-the-top villain (in a villainously ugly jacket) who controls all the gangs of L.A. at least until GH and Kato drive into town in their indestructible Hornetmobile known as the Black Beauty. With apparently little directorial guidance Waltz sensibly decided to have fun and hope for the best. (His role briefly belonged to Nicolas Cage.) In a last-minute tweak the production has also been meaninglessly 3-D-ified -- never mind that theres nothing whatsoever 3-D-ish going on. Maybe those clumsy 3-D glasses are meant to let moviegoers mimic the superhero mask-wearing experience? At any rate they let moviegoers pay more for a ticket. Of course theres little point in giving Rogen the reins (hes also the co-writer and coexecutive producer along with his longtime creative partner Evan Goldberg) if the star cant buzz with the brand of high spirits and poor impulse control that has already won him so many fans. Even slimmed down and groomed up the guy embodies the funny schlub at the party who doesnt understand the ladies but has some hilarious adventures with the gents. I figure by the time Rogen came into the mix anything new probably sounded good including the notion of Britt Reid 2.0 as a spoiled bored rich party boy whose relationship with Kato is something between a bromance and a schoolyard competition. As it turns out despite their best efforts Rogen and Gondry too have gotten stung by the Green Hornet outwitted by this hardy hanger-on in pop cultures evolution. C?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The new film adaptation of ""The Green Hornet raises a few intriguing questions. What if a superhero didnt just pretend to be a loud obnoxious creep as part of his secret identity but really was a loud obnoxious creep? What if his sidekick turned out to have all the talent? And what would happen if the slaphappy French filmmaker Michel Gondry (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ""Be Kind Rewind) tackled a big-money action extravaganza?We have our answers. The first half of ""Green Hornet undermines every promise a superhero movie is supposed to make with genuinely subversive comic verve. Its off-putting rude misshapen and more often than not hysterically funny. The second half sadly is an ear-splitting train wreck.A lot of people are going to be offended and I cant say I blame them The movie waves its heros boorishness like a red flag. Co-writer/star Seth Rogen takes the classic archetype of the playboy by day/masked avenger by night -- from Batman to Iron Man an established source of Hollywood profits -- and reveals him for a braying sociopath. In this telling pampered newspaper heir Britt Reid is an idiot getting by on his money and on the mad skills of his employee and new BFF Kato (Taiwanese pop singer Jay Chou arriving in the US pop arena with a deft three-point landing).Why the revisionism? In part because the Green Hornet was always the superhero equivalent of an independent vendor created for radio in the 1930s and showing up in movie serials and on TV (the 1966 series costarred Bruce Lee as Kato). The character isnt owned by Marvel or DC so hes a free agent -- fair game for the anarchic likes of Kevin Smith (the ""Clerks director took a whack at a Hornet script that never got made) Rogen and co-writer Evan Goldberg and Gondry whose marvelously rickety shaggy-dog contraptions are as far from Marvels sleek money machines as you can get.So ""The Green Hornet is a series of comic riffs -- not so much a parody but like Gondrys ""Be Kind Rewind a tale of two boobs running with a bad idea until it turns unexpectedly excellent. Having lost his disapproving white-knight father (Tom Wilkinson) to a mysterious bee sting Britt bonds with dads Chinese mechanic over the merits of the perfect latte and drastically retooled foreign cars. What starts as a drunken prank becomes a bumptious career in crime-fighting -- wholly ridiculous until LAs preening Mr. Big (Christoph Waltz cashing his ""Inglourious Basterds Oscar win with a shrug) decides to fight back.If you get into its off-kilter rhythms the movies first hour can be startlingly funny with the contrast between Katos efficiency and Britts general uselessness milked for all its worth. (The Green Hornets gas-bomb pistol it turns out is invented only because the hero cant be trusted with a real gun.) There are two ways to play the Asian-manservant thing Either treat it as a politically incorrect no-flyover zone or dig right into its racially loaded contradictions. Gondry and his stars dig wickedly dismantling the master-servant dynamic in favor of boss-employee then buddy-buddy then rival-rival and finally something like unequal partners Kato being slightly more equal than Britt.Theres a very tenuous plot -- something involving the crime boss and a slick district attorney (David Harbour) -- but the filmmakers arent interested. Its like they got up in the morning with the vague idea of making a superhero film and here it is the mid-afternoon and they havent got around to it yet. So they turn up the heat After a ridiculous room-trashing fistfight between the hero and his sidekick (about as ridiculous as the similar fight in ""Iron Man 2) ""The Green Hornet devolves into an overlong confusingly shot demolition derby. What starts as a lark turns into a headache.Did I mention that the movies in 3-D? Someone should have let Gondry know. Except for a few swooping highway scenes and one eye-dazzling multi-split-screen montage -- each panel taking place at a different depth -- ""Hornet could have and should have been shot in two dimensions. (If theres satire there its at the consumers expense.) But the entire movies a flip-off in a sense sustained by its playful spirits and love of anarchy until the whole thing comes crashing down. In the end there are only two special effects on display Chou with his charismatic bad-boy cool and Rogen who scrawls all over the movie like a baby with a crayon.Because superhero movies have to feature a Girl Cameron Diaz turns up as Lenore Case Britts overeducated secretary at the newspaper. Shes his Pepper Potts except that Pepper eventually melts while Lenore takes one look at these two and cant be bothered. The roles disposable and intentionally rather cruel. Chou plays his role as something of a brat too and so does Waltz whose character decides in the third act that he isnt scary enough and gives himself a super-makeover. ""The Green Hornet paints heroes and villains alike as emotionally needy little boys playing dress-up with live ammunition.

Hoberman Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet Superhero Slob Wednesday January 12 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Whos the boss? Jay Chou takes control of the Green Hornet.Jaimie Trueblood A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Only inertia will bring people to Michel Gondrys 3-D spectacle The Green Hornet. Opening amid persistent negative buzz in the mid-January dead zone this long-germinating prospective franchise based on a character that first saturated the nations radio waves in 1939 seems pretty much DOA--although in the absence of any competition its a likely magnet for loose cash.Rather than a 90 million Gondry head trip a la The Science of Sleep or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind the largely retro-fitted 3-D action extravaganza is a 90 million Seth Rogen comedy (he stars and also co-wrote). The indestructible vehicle that the masked crime-fighting Green Hornet (Rogen) drives is this eminently swat-able movies overly optimistic metaphor for itself. Gondry may specialize in fantasies about fantasy but abandon all hope that The Green Hornet is a whimsically ramshackle blockbuster like the ""sweded"" remakes in his Be Kind Rewind. The Green Hornet provides a half-hours worth of mildly entertaining travesty before collapsing in a clamor of bombastic action sequences and lame wisecracks. As slapstick the movie peaks early with a frenzied slo-mo montage of the stars frantic drunken revelry complete with projectile flying out the window of L.A.s Standard Hotel.A sort of ass-backwards Henry IV the narrative has something to do with the flagrantly irresponsible son of a crusading newspaper publisher redeeming himself after Dads death as a flagrantly irresponsible costumed do-gooder--thanks largely to the help of his employees the genius sidekick and ""human Swiss Army knife"" Kato (Chinese pop star Jay Chou) and the unnaturally intelligent looker he hires as his secretary (Cameron Diaz). Buried beneath the movies fat is the notion of a self-entitled white guy lording it over more talented lackeys. Working sometimes at cross-purposes the three succeed in ridding Los Angeles of a local crime czar (Christoph Waltz) and crooked D.A. (David Harbour).Initially conceived by Kevin Smith Rogens Green Hornet is not the first facetious costumed crime-fighter but neither Robert Downey Jr.s Iron Man nor Will Smiths Hancock were as doggedly unattractive as this tubby denizen of Upper Slobovia. That the Green Hornet is also an incorrigible raging asshole provides most of the movies humor. At his loudmouthed best Rogens ridiculous dude-isms and relentless self-justifying blather can suggest a proudly stupid Albert Brooks; at his worst as when tirelessly (or is it tiresomely?) hitting on co-star Diaz hes simply Seth Rogen.Gondry worked well with the obstreperous air-guitar king Jack Black in Be Kind Rewind but where Black is a physical comedian with demonic intensity and Gleason-like grace Rogen is largely post-physical--spasmodic fist-pumping victory dances notwithstanding. His exertions are evident but unsustained; he perfumes the movie with eau de stale sweat socks. (As Manny Farber once wrote of George Kuchars Hold Me While Im Naked The Green Hornet is a movie that loves its own body odor.) The least that can be said of Gondrys contraption is that it seems fully aware of its own idiocy and advances a touchingly anachronistic faith in the power of the press via Edward James Olmoss serious journalist who attempts to run the newspaper the Green Hornet has inherited.Exhibiting none of the cornball grandeur of Tron Gondrys 3-D derives a modicum of interest from his naturally eccentric visual style--gratuitous high-angle shots playfully shallow focus--and fondness for excessively vast or cluttered living spaces. The most effective (and possibly the only genuine) use of 3-D is reserved for the pop Blam Pow moire-patterned end credits. By that time even Rogens fans will most likely have beaten a hasty retreat.

TWITTER Leaving behind a long list of previously attached talent from stars George Clooney Mark Wahlberg and Jake Gyllenhaal to filmmaker Kevin Smith the Black Beauty finally roars into theaters this weekend with Seth Rogen and Jay Chou behind the wheel and director Michel Gondry in charge of its course. While the slick vehicle in question -- a seriously pimped-out Chrysler Imperial -- delivers the awe-inspiring goods The Green Hornet itselfnever achieves sufficient traction to go the blockbuster distance. Credit Rogen who co-wrote the script with Evan Goldberg and Gondry for attempting to take the 75-year-old radio serial (and mid-60s TV series) in some fresh irreverent directions. But the stop/start end result fails to sustain any satisfying momentum. Rogens fan base as well as the fanboys who were teased with footage in July at Comic-Con should ensure the picture has a decent opening but it could fall short of generating sufficient buzz to spawn repeat business. Originally debuting Jan. 31 1936 on Detroits WXYZ The Green Hornet radio serial was the brainchild of Lone Ranger creator George W. Trendle with the masked avengers alter ego Britt Reid said to be the great nephew of the Lone Ranger. Unsurprisingly Britt the playboy son of crusading Daily Sentinel publisher James Reid has been retailored as a wide-eyed slacker to fit the Rogen persona. When his harshly judgmental dad (Tom Wilkinson) dies after what appears to be a fatal bee sting Britt inherits his media empire but hed rather tool around with his fathers trusted mechanic Kato (Chou) in one of his tricked-out luxury cars. Of course it would be even cooler to pose as vigilantes who make like bad guys so they can infiltrate the actual evildoers inner circle and blast em with Katos gas gun. Enter the Green Hornet. It isnt that Gondrys direction and the languid Rogen-Goldberg script (the pair previously collaborated on Pineapple Express and Superbad) dont have their inspired moments -- like a sequence in which a Rogen discourse on the traditional balance of power between a superhero and his sidekick explodes into a volatile fight to the finish. Too often though the dialogue has a habit of commenting on what has just happened in the previous scene effectively stopping the action cold every time. While definitely not cast in the classic comic book hero mold the trimmed-down Rogen still brings a pleasantly goofy everyman likability to the role. As Kato Taiwanese pop star Chou proves equally charismatic although his struggle with the English language makes some of his line readings tricky to decipher. Proving tougher to get a grip on is the villainous Chudnofsky (Oscar-winning Inglourious Basterds scene-stealer Christoph Waltz) and Britt and Katos chipper research assistant Lenore (a squandered Cameron Diaz) both of whom do their best with their underwritten characters. Visually with the exception of Gondrys dynamic ""Kato-Vision"" fight sequences (shot by John Schwartzman) the only other time the 3D conversion really comes to life is during the closing-credit pop art sequence.

"The Green Hornet (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Green Hornet (PG-13) This comic revival of the pulpy crimefighter is smashing popcorn fun. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald1/12/2011 Editor rating 3 The Green Hornet -- the saga of Britt Reid a newspaper publisher by day and masked hero by night who battles baddies with his Asian sidekick Kato -- has been around for almost a century radio show in the 1930s film serial in the 1940s and TV series in the 1960s. All of those incarnations played the crime fighter straight but director Michel Gondrys big-screen revival takes the material in a radically different direction. This Hornet is a big boisterous action-comedy -- a funny exciting and intentionally goofy summer movie that just happens to arrive in the middle of January. Rotund funnyman Seth Rogen who wrote the screenplay with his frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg (they also wrote Superbad and Pineapple Express) initially seemed odd casting for the role of the Bruce Wayne-ish Britt a wealthy playboy who uses his fortune to build impossible gadgets and cars. But Rogen knows how to write parts for himself that make the best use of his talents -- hes perfect as the unlikely mostly hapless hero -- and Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Be Kind Rewind) an equally unexpected choice to direct such pulpy material latches onto Rogens sense of humor. Beginning with the opening scene (which includes a terrific surprise cameo) The Green Hornet strikes a deft balance of comedy and comic-book shenanigans that never wavers. The characters take what is happening seriously but the movie doesnt. Gondry doesnt strive for camp or spoof either of which would have instantly killed the movies buzz. But the picture always keeps the funny coming even when people are being killed in nasty ways. The tone is strongly reminiscent of the satirical kick in Kick-Ass minus the R-rated gore and language (this is an exceptionally kid-friendly movie). The key to its success isnt Rogen who has played this sort of likable doofus before but Taiwanese superstar Jay Chou who makes his English-language debut as Kato a martial-arts expert mechanical whiz and barista extraordinaire. Chou recites his dialogue phonetically the way Bruce Lee (who is paid clever homage here) did on the TV show and his athletic prowess and unaffected performance -- he acts as if he were unaware he is starring in a comedy -- keep The Green Hornet from tipping over into complete idiocy. Hes a perfect foil for Rogen -- the movie is at its best when the two are on their own -- and Gondry gives Chou almost all of the films big action set pieces and special effects for good reason Without Kato the Green Hornet would just be a guy with an outrageously souped-up car (specifically a tricked-out Chrysler Imperial which makes the Batmobile look like a Yugo). Every superhero saga lives or dies by the strength of its villain and The Green Hornet unfortunately is saddled with a generic one The drug-dealing gangster Chudnofsky played by Inglourious Basterds Christoph Waltz. The character is so thin -- he is distinguished only by his poor fashion sense -- that even the gifted Waltz cant do anything to enliven his evil glee. Faring worse is Cameron Diaz as Britts secretary who serves absolutely no purpose in the story - none - other than to prove that Britt and Kato arent gay although the film still exploits the heroes bromance for laughs ""Girls are such a drag Kato"" Britt complains. ""Its a good thing we have each other."" Those flaws may keep The Green Hornet from soaring outright but Gondry keeps spinning the giddy fun including an impressive 3D upconversion -- the best Ive seen (youd never guess the film was shot with 2D cameras). The movie isnt as transgressive or experimental as Gondrys participation promised. Theres only one sequence arriving late in the film in which the director is allowed to cut loose with his eccentric style Youll know it when you see it. But Gondry turns out to be surprisingly adept at orchestrating large-scale action such as the climactic showdown which spreads from a newspapers pressing plant to a newsroom populated by old-media reporters. That setting will probably date The Green Hornet -- you can imagine kids watching the movie a few years from now thinking of it as a period piece set in the ancient past. The rest of this irreverent immensely likable entertainment though feels of the moment. More Information Cast Seth Rogen Jay Chou Cameron Diaz Christoph Waltz Edward James Olmos Tom Wilkinson.

Their enemy is debonair crime kingpin Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz rolling out his Oscar-winning hot-hot-hot-hot-COLD Hans Landa turn) and with the aid of a slickly remodelled vintage Chrysler some custom-moulded masks and a pair of silly hats the pair set out to obliterate the criminal scourge of LA.Although his name has a muted presence on the films trailers and posters French filmmaker Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) has done a stellar job of putting his wacky auteurial stamp on a comedy which is only semi-coherent but still very funny and impeccably fashioned. The films focus on bumbling makeshift heroes plus Gondrys bold choreography and playful use of depth and scale (the 3D element is used particularly well) ally this to the directors previous studio outing Be Kind Rewind (2008) although this lacks the thematic richness of that film. Some might choose to see Kato as Gondry himself - a hip innovative craftsman selling his tricksy wares to a benign corporate overseer. On the downside the film foolishly assumes that the charming fratboy chemistry between Rogen and Chou will disguise a tissue-thin story. On the upside Gondry and writing team Rogen and Evan Goldberg have fun inverting superhero convention and not in the same pleased-with-itself way as Kick-Ass. Here being subversive and self-reflexive doesnt mean comedy swearing or violence it means staging a prolonged fist-fight in front of a giant Carlos Santana poster.

Seth Rogen carries the film along very nicely and is entirely plausible as rich party boy cum night time hero. But around half-way through the storyline seems to have evaporated.

"The Green Hornet | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review The Green Hornet Peter Debruge Chief Film Critic AskDebruge 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr January 11 2011 | 0900PM PT Michel Gondrys ""The Green Hornet"" reinvents the retro vigilante delivering the goods for a punchy 3D breakout. Reaching even further back than the recent comicbook craze for inspiration Michel Gondrys ""The Green Hornet"" feels less like a throwback to the hardboiled era in which the 1930s radio serial was hatched than an homage to buddy-based 80s action comedies. Though the film is a blast marketing has been a challenge with Sony fighting bad buzz date changes and confusion with other better-known emerald-hued heroes (Green Lantern and Green Arrow). Ironically that perfect storm allows the team to defy the purists and reinvent the retro vigilante to their rowdy irreverent specs delivering the goods for a punchy 3D breakout. Given a comic spin by star Seth Rogen and co-writer Evan Goldberg this 21st-century ""Hornet"" coasts on sheer fantasy fulfillment as the against-type protag -- more couch potato than caped crusader -- revels in the chance to suit up and act out his childhood superhero fantasies. When the film opens Rogens Britt Reid is living it up as the playboy son of a Los Angeles newspaper tycoon (Tom Wilkinson) until his fathers sudden death by bee sting brings an abrupt end to his years of hedonism. Forced to behave like a grown-up for the first time in his life Britt befriends his fathers multi-talented mechanic Kato (Taiwanese pop star Jay Chou presumably expanding the pics Asian reach) and the foolhardy duo take Dads beloved Chrysler Imperial out on the town -- a joyride that inspires the unlikely partners to launch an even unlikelier career of amateur street justice posing as criminals and using Dads newspaper connections to fuel their own infamy. By this point modern auds are so steeped in superhero lore that ""Hornet"" can get away with using its endearing mix of comedy and comicbook shorthand to whisk right past such considerations as why these two characters would risk life and limb to take on L.A.s one-stop uber-villain Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz). Instead of brooding introspection the script offers up comedic scenes of the pair brainstorming about costume options or trying to pick the right name with a running joke about Katos superhero name still searching for its first laugh in the final scene. Ultimately Britts reckless foray into crimefighting seems motivated not by getting even (which spares us the gratuitous murder/rape/humiliation of a loved one so common in such stories) but by the excitement of finally getting out from under Daddys controlling thumb which lends an air of vicarious fun to their exploits. The pics 3D visuals add further energy even though the conversion was handled in post which sometimes results in strange glitches (foreground objects that judder or windowpanes that distort) for John Schwartzmans constantly moving camera. The action begins mildly enough. Drug dealers and thugs pose little threat to the Green Hornet and his tricked-out Imperial -- dubbed ""the Black Beauty"" and rigged with everything from rocket launchers to a record player -- which means that until Britt and Kato manage to track down Chudnofsky the most amusing conflict occurs between the partners themselves. This is hardly the first buddy movie in which the love interest (Cameron Diaz plays newsgal Lenore Case) cant compete with the chemistry between the two leads but ""Hornet"" manages to be self-aware (poking innocuous fun at their too-intimate dynamic for instance) without crossing into self-deflating wink-wink territory. The best example is a clever confrontation between Chudnofsky and a rival drug dealer (an uncredited James Franco) early in the film which uses repartee rather than action to establish Waltzs villainy (with the actor blending charm and menace once again in his first post-""Inglourious Basterds"" appearance). Although Gondry may seem an odd choice to direct ""Hornet"" was once intended to be the helmers feature debut a fact reported in the pages of Variety 14 years ago. But Gondry checks his personal aesthetic at the door goosing this polished big-studio exercise with an arsenal of visual tricks without calling attention to himself behind the camera. Originally conceived 75 years ago by ""The Lone Ranger"" creator George W. Trendle the Green Hornet couldnt have been an easy character to modernize and Rogen and Goldberg wield their comedy to excuse such details as his ineffective knockout-gas gun and the awkward master-servant dynamic. Understandably Kato isnt crazy about his subservient role which is part crude Asian stereotype and part ""Driving Miss Daisy."" Among his innovations Gondry introduces ""Kato-vision"" an X-ray-style ability to instantly analyze all the weapons and threats in any given confrontation. That feature not only compensates for the fact that Chou is no Bruce Lee (who played Kato on TV) but also gives us the ability to make sense of whats happening in the rapidly edited action scenes that follow.
