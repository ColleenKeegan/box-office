Peter Iovino/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Peter Iovino/Sony Pictures Director Paul WeilandGenre ComedyRunning Time 101 minutes Watch a Clip Theres nothing remotely honorable about Made of Honor a gender-reversed take on My Best Friends Wedding that might be merely annoying if its leading man and its director werent competing to see who could be more mean-spirited. A tale of temporarily thwarted romance between alleged best friends Tom (Patrick Dempsey) and Hannah (Michelle Monaghan) this chemistry-free film begins on a low note in 1998 -- one Bill Clinton mask a sprinkling of Lewinsky jokes a touch of vomiting -- then flashes forward to establish that nothing much has changed in the ensuing decade. Tom continues to bed-hop like a superannuated frat boy while hapless Hannah now an art curator is introduced with a sight gag in which she appears to be fellating a painting. She will soon go to Scotland fall for a handsome lug and ask Tom to be her maid of honor; hell prove worthy of that friendly gesture by doing everything he can to sabotage the wedding. Formulaic lo-jinks ensue along with formulaic jokes formulaic song cues formulaic character arcs even formulaic costuming. Paul Weilands previous directing stints have mostly involved Mr. Bean and his work here -- in which stereotypes and body types are required to do a lot of comic heavy lifting -- is only a smidgen more sophisticated.

"Made of Honor | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; made-of-honor ) Made of Honor (United States/United Kingdom 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Romantic comedies sell fantasy. Ultimately thats their reason for being - to make even the most cynical heart crave true love. Some romantic comedies this one included fail because of an inability to convince the audience that the protagonists deserve to live happily ever after. Theres a simple romantic comedy litmus test. Ask this question By the time the moment of decision arrives are we rooting for these two to be together? Is their union inevitable though it may be in a movie world where formula is valued over all else the only path to a satisfying ending? Sadly for Made of Honor with its drawn-out poorly developed love affair and paper thin characters the answer is no. We expect the two leads to end up together - not because they inspire us to quote sonnets but because thats how we have been conditioned. I like it when a movie seduces me; this one doesnt. The point of Made of Honor seems to be to get a product into theaters that can capitalize on Patrick Dempseys transformation from his teenage McWeenie to his adult McDreamy. However having gotten the actor the filmmakers apparently didnt feel it necessary to develop a movie that worked on any level. And while the term ""chemistry"" is overused its a valid descriptor for the spark of interaction that must be present between two characters whenever a relationship (whether platonic or romantic) occurs. Theres little between Dempsey and his co-star Michelle Monaghan although one senses that based on the opening ""meet cute"" scene there could have been had the screenplay allowed these two to spend some quiet time together without the annoying secondary characters constantly polluting the mix. The film opens with the meeting between Tom (Dempsey) and Hannah (Monaghan) during his senior year at college. Ten years later theyre best friends but their relationship is strictly platonic. In fact Hannah may be the only woman in New York City with whom Tom has not slept. He has sex with a different woman almost every night (and never the same one twice in any week - thats one of many rules he lives by) then regales Hannah with stories of his conquests. He then reveals to his generic male posse that he has the perfect life variety in the bedroom and companionship with Hannah in other areas of his life. The stability of his existence is shaken however when she goes on a six-week business trip to Scotland. While shes there he realizes his feelings are more than friendly and vows to tell her upon her return. Unfortunately for him when she shows up in New York she has a bloke (Kevin McKidd) in tow. This man who apparently has so few flaws that Superman would be envious is named Colin and is her fiancA(c). She surprises Tom by asking that he be her ""Maid"" of Honor. Since he has a better chance to destroy the wedding from the inside than from a distant position he agrees. Made of Honors story is not dissimilar to the one told in My Best Friends Wedding. Comparing the films is useful in that it shows how frightened Hollywood has recently become by a romance that doesnt fit into a nice tidy package. Made of Honor establishes in the first scene who will end up together in the last scene. Everything that comes in between is pointless filler. Worse its not even interesting filler. For all the scenes that Hannah and Tom share together theres very little that allows us to see them as more than actors sharing the same shot. Those critical ""falling in love"" moments are too few and far between for the audience to develop a heartfelt interest in them becoming a couple. It might help if Tom was a bit less of a self-centered jerk. He drives like an ass uses women like the condoms he probably buys by the crate and believes Hannah should be available whenever he needs an ear or a shoulder. (Nitpick alerta| Theres a scene in which Tom places a phone call to Hannah while shes in Scotland. He awakens her and she informs him that its 3 a.m. Meanwhile Tom is sitting in his apartment in full daylight. How many hours difference does director Paul Weiland thinks there are between Scotland and New York? Even assuming its the middle of the summer the sun does not set in Manhattan after 10 p.m.) In order to make Tom more appealing Made of Honor makes Colin into a stuck-up White Knight stereotype. It would after all be dangerous to transform him into a multidimensional character because viewers might be more in favor of the Hannah/Colin pairing. Meanwhile despite apparently being conflicted between two men Hannah doesnt do nearly enough soul-searching until the late-innings moment when she and Tom share a lip-lock. Most of the humor in Made of Honor is tepid but thats not unusual for a romantic comedies. Unless someone like Judd Apatow is involved movies in this genre are more interested in melting hearts than busting guts. Made of Honor does neither. The movie is being touted as ""counterprogramming"" for Iron Man but this amounts to providing a stale unremarkable alternative to something thats surprisingly fresh and energetic. Made of Honor is a prefabricated example of shoddy workmanship.

"Made of Honor Not made in heaven | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMade of Honor Not made in heaven Decades ago Made of Honor would have been a perfect vehicle for Cary Grant.As the rumpled Tom ""maid of honour"" to Michelle Monaghans Hannah Patrick Dempsey is no Cary Grant.   (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. May 2 2008 Starring Patrick Dempsey Michelle Monaghan and Kevin McKidd. Directed by Paul Weiland. 101 minutes. At major theatres. PG Decades ago Made of Honor would have been a perfect vehicle for Cary Grant. The hero of this movie is Tom (Patrick Dempsey) a wealthy playboy who discovers hes deeply in love with the woman he has been friends with for many years. Now Hannah (Michelle Monaghan) is getting married to someone else and Tom must find a way to disrupt the wedding and claim her for his own. Actually Cary Grant did something very much like this in The Philadelphia Story back in 1940. But where Grant was elegant Dempsey (Greys Anatomy) is rumpled and half-awake. He looks like hes squinting all the time. Article Continued BelowToms also a bit creepier with his ""rules"" about bedmates than Philadelphia Storys C.K. Dexter Haven . ""What are you doing tonight?"" asks a blonde as Tom gets out of bed in the morning. ""I dont do back to backs"" he replies. Comparisons are odious to be sure but the moviemakers cant complain since Made of Honor is all about men sizing each other up in the most crude and literal fashion. When Hannahs Scottish fiance Colin (Kevin McKidd) visits New York Tom invites him to a basketball game with his buddies in order to test Colins athletic prowess. Unfortunately for Tom Colin demonstrates a convincing ability to slam dunk which in Toms eyes proves Colins manhood - an impression confirmed when he sees Colin in the shower with ""that monster thing of his"" as one of Toms buddies puts it. Its often a problem to determine when a movie is satirizing characters from a superior height and when its sharing the mental level of those characters. Certainly in Made of Honor there are numerous references to insecure masculinity - ""I can feel my sperm dying within me"" says one of Toms buddies when hes asked to tie ribbons and prepare gifts for Hannahs shower. Toms own title of ""maid of honour"" is an obvious occasion for other characters to question his sexual orientation.Sports provides the litmus test of these questions. Before the wedding in Scotland Tom - already symbolically castrated by being made to wear a kilt like a miniskirt - competes in tossing the phallic caber with Colin. Over the cellphone New York buddies try to buck him up with sports metaphors - ""Take a shot win the game and bring her home.""Only once does the movie provide an interesting perspective on its hero when we are shown his fathers apartment with its shelves of books. By contrast Toms apartment contains only rows of DVDs and CDs. The critical verdict on this movie is unavoidable. It is as shallow as Tom is. Theres just too much silliness - a fat girl bursting the seams of her bridesmaids dress a pompous Scottish aristocrat saying ""Were a long line of Athols"" pronounced as if she were lisping.Somewhere in the shades of Hollywood the ghost of Cary Grant is shaking his head.

Starring Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan. Directed by Paul Weiland. (PG-13. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Every decent joke in ""Made of Honor"" is contained in the trailer but thats not unusual. Whats unusual is that the trailer itself - that is a three-minute film - seems more appropriate to the story of ""Made of Honor"" than the long stretched-out thing we get when we see the movie. This is a story that should have been at the absolute most 20 minutes long A man realizes that hes in love with a woman that he has thought of only as a friend. But just as he realizes it she announces that shes marrying someone else. So he has one move Tell her how he feels. He has no reason not to tell her. And then she decides yes or no. Thats the story. Twenty minutes tops. But ""Made of Honor"" had to be feature length and so the movie contains a scene showing how the two met in college years before. It shows him playing basketball with his friends talking about all the plot developments weve seen already. We get endless scenes of them advising him to do things he should know to do on his own. And we even get a disquisition on Scottish matrimonial rights. By the end the fact that only 101 minutes have gone by comes as a surprise. ""Made of Honor"" feels like a 130-minute picture. Our hero of course is a great ladies man. Tom (Patrick Dempsey) is one of those guys who just walk into a room and beautiful women start pelting them with phone numbers. Ive never actually met one of those guys but you see them all the time in the movies. Tom goes from woman to woman - he has sex with everybody but theyre all pretty much disposable. However his awakened love for Hannah (Michelle Monaghan) is were to understand the real deal. By the way thats another myth the companion to the great ladies man myth the myth of the Disposable Woman. Romantic comedies about men are always intent on demonstrating that the heros attachment to his beloved is not the result of desperation (that he cant get anybody else) but of sincere affection. And so its common to show him going to bed with an inordinate number of women all of them so attractive as to stand as positive proof of the sincerity and rarity of his devotion to the true object of his passion. The problem is that the Disposable Women dont really seem all that disposable in ""Made of Honor"" or particularly different from the beloved. So were left to wonder if Toms inability to feel anything for other women is really evidence that his heart is elsewhere or if his romantic preoccupation is just some short-term sentimental attachment. That is maybe his heart isnt elsewhere but just doesnt exist. I mean if your real goal is to be promiscuous and detached what better way to do it than to convince yourself youre in love with a woman youll never have? As appealing as Patrick Dempsey is something in his slippery smooth demeanor makes it easy to have these suspicions about Tom at least enough to make ""Made of Honor"" less than a clear-cut rooting experience. Even if you dont think Hannah should move to Scotland to marry a fabulously wealthy scotch magnate her choices in life arent reduced to two guys. As played by the always engaging and down-to-earth Monaghan Hannah deserves better than either confinement in a Scottish castle or life with a shallow narcissist. But wait. At this point Im giving more thought to the characters than the writers did. This is silly stuff made of cardboard with one of those Gordian-knot plots that could easily be cut through by one persons simply being honest with another person for 30 whole seconds. Theres not much more to say. Yet the sad thing is that instead of complicating a simple premise ""Made of Honor"" with the same cast and a better script could have pursued a more complicated direction. For example what if Hannahs new boyfriend were someone she really should marry thus leaving Tom out in the cold? What would happen then - to Tom? To Hannah? What would the movie be saying then? But that might have been interesting and the last thing they wanted to do with this one is make it interesting. -- Advisory Sex jokes sex talk sexual situations.

Made of Honor (PG-13) Columbia (104 min.) Directed by Paul Weiland. With Patrick Dempsey Michelle Monaghan. Now playing in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS Tom is a fabulously wealthy Manhattan bachelor who loves telling people how he made his millions. (You know that crazy cardboard invention Starbucks wraps around your take-out cup of coffee? His.) He has a great loft a cool car and a different date for every night of the week. But the best day is Sunday when he recounts the weeks adventures to Hannah. Hannah is his best friend since college probably because theyve never slept together and they always tell each other the truth. But then Hannah gets engaged and Tom realizes hes been lying to her -- and himself -- for years. Shes not his best friend. Shes the love of his life. And now not only is she marrying someone else but shes asked Tom to be her maid of honor. The set-up isnt that different from ""My Best Friends Wedding"" except for the gender shift (in that far better 1997 film it was Julia Roberts who had to watch her male pal swap vows with someone else). Unfortunately its whats new here that doesnt work because the switch in focus suddenly blurs the whole story. The chief charming attraction of a femme film isnt that much different from that of a guy flick -- its 90 minutes or so of escapism with a strongly sympathetic figure at the core to identify with. The plot details are different (true love in one car crashes in the other) and so are the props (black velvet mules red Ferraris) but the vicarious lose-yourself pleasure remains the same. But who are female fans supposed to identify with here? As you can tell from the posters -- which put Patrick Dempsey front and center leave off his co-stars name and reduce all the women to half-obscured faces -- its Tom whos the main character. And frankly hes not all that interesting. The movie has some nasty fun humiliating him but the lumpen buddies it surrounds him with are no substitute for the gay-best-friends of more standard womens pictures. And the basic question of the plot -- will he finally just tell Hannah he loves her? -- reduces the heroine to an afterthought a passive patient prize in her own movie. Director Paul Weiland -- a British filmmaker whose chief American credit had been the less-than-immortal ""City Slickers II"" -- keeps things moving and its a relief to see Manhattan played by Manhattan for a change instead of Toronto. (Even though it gets some details wrong -- no Saks Fifth Avenue trousseaux do not include riding crops.) And Michelle Monaghan who plays Hannah seems pert and sweet (although she had far more to do as Casey Afflecks partner in ""Gone Baby Gone""). But Dempsey -- all his McHype notwithstanding -- isnt big enough for the movies. (Literally -- his eyes so small and close-set dont give him the commanding gaze a real big-screen star needs for close-ups.) And the script while occasionally trying for ""Knocked Up"" raunchiness just comes off as crass and crude. (Although it was rated PG-13 after a fight dont take your daughter unless you want to explain the uses of various ""rubber novelties."") Do yourself a favor Send ""regrets"" to this affair and rent ""My Best Friends Wedding"" again or even ""27 Dresses"" (or if you really must a few DVDs of ""Greys Anatomy""). Youll save a few dollars. And youll see a femme film the way its meant to be seen -- in pajamas and fuzzy slippers with plenty of pals and pints of Haagen-Dazs to share. Rating note The film contains crude sex jokes strong language and comic violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Li View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) April 19 2002 | 400am The former maid of Marlon Brando claims the screen legend sired her three kids during a 13-year love affair promised to support her forever - and then abruptly cut off the cash. Maria Christina Ruiz yesterday filed a 100 million lawsuit against Brando in Los Angeles Superior Court claiming breach of contract. Ruiz 43 said she began her long liaison with the reclusive Oscar winner in February 1988 as she worked as one of his domestic servants. At the time she was 29 and he was 63. The pair began living as man and wife at his home and a house he provided for her in Los Angeles although they never married. Over the next six years she had three children by the star of ""The Godfather"" according to court papers. The oldest Ninna Priscilla Brando was born in 1989 and is now 13. The other two kids are 10 and 8. The lawsuit did not disclose their sex. Ruiz claims their affair continued until last year when in December Brando stopped ""all support and maintenance"" to her although he has kept paying child support. Brando 78 had no comment last night said his agent. The actor has been wed three times and had a string of affairs in his heyday as a Hollywood bad boy in the 50s and 60s. In 1990 his troubled son Christian killed Dag Drollet the lover of Marlons daughter Cheyenne and went to prison. Five years later a despondent Cheyenne committed suicide by hanging herself sending Marlon into a deep depression during which he ballooned to nearly 400 pounds. Brandos kids by Ruiz are his ninth 10th and 11th.

Romantic comedy about a womanizer who falls for his engaged-to-be-married best friend. With Patrick Dempsey Michelle Monaghan. Director Paul Weiland (141). PG-13 Sexuality language. At area theaters.In the new romantic comedy ""Made of Honor"" a jealous Julia Roberts promises to help plan Dermot Mulroneys wedding while secretly intending to sabotage - oh wait. Wrong movie?Well barely. Swap the girls for the boys and youve got ""My Best Friends Wedding"" all over again. But the first time is always the best isnt it? Our green-eyed hero is Tom (Patrick Dempsey) a Manhattan playboy who never sees the same woman two nights in a row. The sole exception is Hannah (Michelle Monaghan) an art historian whos been his best friend since college. Shes his confidant his backup date Sally to his Harry. So when work takes her to Scotland for six weeks he finally realizes - with a little prodding from his dad (Sydney Pollack) - that hes ready to settle down. With her. Unfortunately she has other plans. And when she returns new fiance (Kevin McKidd) in tow she asks Tom to be maid of honor at her upcoming wedding. Naturally most of what ensues could have been avoided if shed simply asked him to be her best man. But then we wouldnt have a movie so Dempsey dutifully plans her shower shops for china and gossips with the bridesmaids over tea. All the while of course hes trying to find a way to tell Hannah how he really feels. Though Monaghan looks mildly shell-shocked throughout Dempsey handles the snickering emasculation with impressive good humor. And while director Paul Weiland tries to keep up a brisk pace theres little he can do with a lazy script from three screenwriters who take the low road every time. The cinematic equivalent of a cookie-cutter wedding ""Made of Honor"" ultimately feels a little depressing. Shouldnt any major event from getting married to making a movie inspire some hint of passion and creativity?

By Peter Rainer May 2 2008 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Patrick Dempsey goes into charm overload in ""Made of Honor"" to no avail. Hes playing Tom a ladies man with commitment issues. The real mystery however is why Dempsey chose to commit to this script which is all about how you dont know who you love until she is taken away. The love in this case is his best friend Hanna (Michelle Monaghan) who might as well be wearing a neon sign that reads ""Hey dummy I love you.""But of course if Tom picked up on this thered be no movie. So Hanna goes and gets herself engaged to a Scotsman (Kevin McKidd) while away on a business trip and Tom plots to get her back before the knot is tied. Guess how it turns out? The only surprise to me about this movie is that there no jokes about kilts - a serious omission in an otherwise entirely predictable farce. (PG-13 for sexual content and language.)

Tom accepts - but only so he can woo the bride-to-be and attempt to stop the wedding before its too late. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Does anyone ever demand a refund for a romantic comedy that looks awfully familiar? Lets hope not or the folks behind ""Made of Honor"" -- essentially the same plot as 1997s ""My Best Friends Wedding"" but with a gender twist -- will have to do some serious reimbursement. Patrick Dempsey owner of the most intriguingly crooked nose east of Owen Wilson plays Tom a New York City rogue who beds every nubile woman in town except for Hannah (Michelle Monaghan) his best friend since college. They are kindred spirits who spend lazy Sundays shopping for antiques and debating about the best pastries at Manhattans top bakery. Theyre both attractive and funny and utterly honest with each other. And because each has the other on a high pedestal theyve kept it platonic for a decade. They have kooky backgrounds. He is the rich carefree inventor of the cardboard coffee-cup cozy stocked at every coffee shop. She is an art restorer cleaning the private parts of a male nude when we first encounter her at work. But essentially theyre the Standard Cute Couple Kept Apart by Plot Contrivances. When Hannah leaves for an extended stay in Scotland Tom realizes how important she is to him stunning his basketball buddies with his vow to propose when she returns. In true Standard-Cute-Couple-Kept-Apart fashion she meets Tom for dinner with her new fiance Colin a handsome wealthy and athletic Scottish duke. Tom literally pratfalls in dismay knocking over a passing waiter and scattering arugula to the four winds. Subtle reactions are illegal in a film like this. The comedy is so weak that it has to be broad. Toms efforts to undermine the wedding ceremony by exposing Colins weaknesses boomerang as the Scot proves more athletic and accomplished at every turn. But there is a last-minute rush to the wedding chapel to halt the ceremony as we knew there must be and Tom bursts into the aisle precisely as the minister intones ""or forever hold your peace."" Just as we knew he would. MADE OF HONOR  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sexual content and language. The film is uninspired from the nonsense pun of the title to the final credits. It doesnt promise much and scarcely delivers on that.

Made of Honor is the second romantic comedy this year to use the Clinton presidency as a plot point and the Commander in Chiefs infamous dalliance with a woman named Monica. First it was Ryan Reynolds as an idealistic campaign worker in Definitely Maybe and now its Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan meeting cute on a college campus. Its Halloween 1998 and he Tom is on the prowl in a Clinton mask. She Hannah is asleep in her dorm but he thinks shes somebody else waiting beneath the sheets for the pants-dropping prez. Yelps of horror and blurts of embarrassment ensue and then so does a deep - and platonic - friendship between the serial cad and the pretty fine arts major. Flash forward 10 years and Hannahs restoring Renaissance paintings at the Metropolitan Museum and Toms a Manhattan millionaire - he invented the ""coffee collar"" the piece of cardboard that slips around a to-go cup. He gets a dime for every Starbucks cup sold. (And Starbucks gets prominent product placement.) Best friends Hannah and Tom meet every Sunday for dim sum and call each other day and night to talk about events big and small. But Tom like his oft-divorced father (Sydney Pollack) cant keep his hands off the ladies. He has systems of seduction rules of engagement. Hed be a commitment-phobe if he knew what commitment meant but he has no idea. And then Hannah heads to Scotland for work and Tom finds his life strangely empty. Youve seen it in the trailer There he is playing basketball with his buds confessing ""Its got me thinking. Theres more to life than just sleeping around."" Made Of Honor is My Best Friends Wedding by way of Four Weddings and a Funeral. Directed by the Brit Paul Weiland (City Slickers II) and scripted in part by Philadelphias rom-com power couple Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan Made of Honor finds Dr. McDreamy realizing that hes in love with Monaghans smart sassy Hannah and then doing everything he can to ""destroy the wedding from within."" There are gay jokes. There is snappy discourse about dresses crockery nuptial etiquette. And then there is the grand wedding in Scotland in the old castle on the loch belonging to Colin McMurray (Kevin McKidd) heir to a whiskey fortune and a guy whos big strong redheaded and wears a kilt. Is Hannah really going to marry this guy? Of course not. Made of Honor is the kind of formulaic fare - theres even that turn-the-car-around-and-get-me-back-to-the-church moment - that depends on the wit of the script and the spark of its stars. In those departments the film is just middling. A clever line here and there a debonair Dempsey wink a cute Monaghan nod and another Bill and Monica reference to tie things all together. Made of Honor 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Paul Weiland. With Patrick Dempsey Michelle Monaghan Kevin McKidd and Sydney Pollack. Distributed by Sony Pictures. Running time 1 hour 41 mins.

Actors Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan are trapped in the wreckage of a bad romantic comedy. Observers suggest the vehicle in which they were riding was poorly engineered and believed to be constructed of cheap recycled material. The severity of their injuries is unclear at this time. This StoryTacky Made of Honor Is Missing a Best ManFind Made of Honor ShowtimesTranscript Behind the Screen Prospective Hollywood agents are standing by thumbs on their BlackBerrys. As we await further updates from our critic on the ground -- and he really is on the ground our medical team is on top of that -- heres what weve learned so far. The vehicle is called ""Made of Honor"" -- a summer rom com clearly gone wrong. In custody are director Paul Weiland best known for television episodes of British comedian Mr. Bean and three screenwriters whom -- at this time -- weve never heard of. How did this happen? As we try to make sense of this unfolding situation we will attempt to read from our reviewers notes though theyre somewhat illegible due to his distress at what he saw . . .    ""Made of Honor"" like most any romantic comedy revisits humanitys deepest yearning to find the love of a lifetime. And the film clearly aims to explore the fun of romancing and the entertaining differences between the genders -- topics to actively engage any audience. But as presented ""Made of Honor"" turns all business of the heart into something sleazy unpalatable and even disturbing. And instead of presenting two strongly appealing characters we practically want to reach out and push together it makes us actively consider an intervention -- at least on Hannahs behalf. Thats right. We actually want to enter this fictional world and tell Hannah (Monaghan) to run screaming from Tom (Dempsey) who takes women down as if they were springboks on the veldt. Even though shes his platonic pal since college days we dont need to have sat through every Julia Roberts movie of the 1990s to know shes in trouble. Its just a matter of time before these buddies take longer and longer to pull away from their friendly hugs. What clinches it Hannahs decision to marry the impossibly wonderful rich and Scottish Colin (Kevin McKidd) and to have Tom as her ""maid"" of honor at the wedding. The icky factor starts right away when we meet Tom in his student days. (This is just moments before he ""meets cute"" with Hannah.) There he is on Halloween dressed up in a Bill Clinton mask rolling a cigar lasciviously under his nose and looking for a prearranged roll in the bed with a coed wearing a Monica mask. Whats disturbing about the movie beyond its craven cribbing of the college-into-adulthood relationship of 1989s ""When Harry Met Sally . . . "" is its winky assumption that well chuckle and tacitly approve of Toms rakish manner. Cue the ""fun""-of-romancing section as Tom continues being Tom in his adult years. But instead of seeing through his rakish ways women slip him their phone numbers often hastily scrawled on Starbucks coffee sleeves. In the filmmakers world view women get what they deserve or maybe they just dont understand the difference between a mischievous ladies man and a basic horn dog. Sure Hannah disapproves of her best friends MO but she figures thats just Tom. And how they chat endlessly -- apparently adorably -- about the best restaurants the women who arent speaking to him anymore and his ""rules"" of dating. He will not do ""back to back"" dates with the same woman. Dempsey and Monaghans ""it"" factors were high coming into this movie. Dempseys fresh from the hugely successful Walt Disney romance ""Enchanted"" and that stint as surgeon ""McDreamy"" on TVs ""Greys Anatomy."" Monaghan showed her sexy-funny side in ""The Heartbreak Kid"" and her more serious chops in ""Gone Baby Gone."" Yet they greenlighted a movie that never strays from predictability and puts them in an unflattering light. Thats why I could only assume both performers were coshed over the head spirited away to a closed set and forced at gunpoint to participate in this movie. But as the movie continues its unerring descent into oblivion all thoughts of intervention or rescue seem pointless. These characters -- and the actors who play them -- clearly deserve one another. Made of Honor (101 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content and profanity. >> This StoryRead +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Tacky Made of Honor Is Missing a Best Man Find Made of Honor Showtimes Transcript Behind the Screen",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/01/AR2008050103845.html,200,madeofhonor20,madeofhonor,washingtonpost
Made of Honor (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Made of Honor (PG-13)  For a movie clearly aimed at a female audience it has a curious attitude toward women portraying them as stupid dull and easily duped. Photo Columbia Pictures Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle Miami Herald If we held a competition among Greys Anatomy stars to evaluate who made the best adult romantic comedy in recent memory Katherine Heigl (27 Dresses) would crush Patrick Dempsey under her stilettos without even breaking a sweat. (Not that Heigl sweats; one suspects she exudes fragrant mist.) Dempsey -- McDreamy to those of you who swoon at the sight of his crooked smile McWhatever to the rest of us -- is the star of Made of Honor a film so dreadful and humiliating that its reassuring to know Dempsey can keep his day job. He stars as manwhore Tom a successful something-or-other in Manhattan who sleeps with a different woman every night but realizes hes in love with his best friend Hannah (Michelle Monaghan Gone Baby Gone) when she announces shes getting married. Tom being 30-something and so blindingly handsome that he has never had to profess love to a woman -- or so the script would have you think -- doesnt know how to tell Hannah the truth. Frankly its hard to believe that Tom would even have a female friend hes so uninterested in talking to women. He doesnt have to call them back or work to gain their interest. Beautiful Starbucks clerks slip him phone numbers and hes got his own blogger/stalker. Thus hampered by fabulousness he agrees to be Hannahs maid of honor to scuttle the wedding from the inside. Made of Honor may sound vaguely like My Best Friends Wedding but this film hasnt a subversive bone in its body; it would never allow a conniving smart often dislikable woman such as the one played by Julia Roberts to show up. It does however have plenty of misogynistic tendencies. For a movie clearly aimed at a female audience it has a curious attitude toward women portraying them as stupid dull and easily duped except Hannah of course. And even Hannah crumbles immediately when she meets a tall apparently well-endowed Scottish duke (Kevin McKidd) happily ditching her career family and friends to eat haggis wear plaid and give birth to children named Angus. The jokes are painfully obvious A bridesmaid is too fat for her dress A guy mistakenly eats potpourri The minister thinks Tom is gay The grooms relatives think Tom is gay Are you exhausted yet? You soon will be especially when Tom ends up riding to church on horseback in order to get there before the speak now or forever hold your peace bit. Im speaking now so listen Dont waste your money.

Well have to wait to find out. While he is perfectly likable in his patented cultivated-stubble way in Made of Honor Dempsey is basically McDreamy writ large. Tom Dempseys character doesnt have quite the hangdog demeanor of his Greys Anatomy character but he does have luck with the ladies. Except with Hannah (Michelle Monaghan) and thats by design. The two met in college and became instant best friends despite the rather inelegant way in which they meet. (Only in a movie.) In the present Tom is wildly rich by way of inventing the coffee collar used by Starbucks to keep your hands from being burned. As he has his way with pretty much the entire female population of New York Hannah remains his loyal and trusted friend someone he can talk to about anything - including his latest conquests. For instance shes Toms designated guest at his fathers weddings (hes a serial marrier). They dance they drink - then say goodbye for the evening. Hannah gets called away to Scotland on business. While shes gone Tom realizes how much she means to him - perhaps you recognize this particular development from the 200 or so movies in which it has appeared before - and makes up his mind to tell her when she gets home. That doesnt go so well. Difficult to express your love when she has the perfect would-be husband in tow. That would be Colin (Kevin McKidd). Hes rich hes royalty hes bigger and better than Tom in every way (every way). Whats more Hannah asks Tom to be her maid of honor. Yes. In every way except the stupid dress. This annoys the would-be female maid of honor (Phoenix native Busy Philipps) and amuses everyone else. But Tom and his pals figure its his best way to sabotage the wedding from the inside. If this sounds like a generic romantic comedy so far theres a reason. There are no surprises no jaw-dropping moments. There are however some good performances. Monaghans OK although the best-buds chemistry between Hannah and Tom is somewhat lacking. McKidd great as Lucius Vorenus in HBOs Rome is fine as Colin a guy who can do everything youd think a Scottish guy could do include play the bagpipes. (His parents own a distillery; could he be a better catch?) Sydney Pollack as Toms dad steals the few scenes hes in. Negotiating the prenup in the church lobby? Love it. But how you feel about Made of Honor depends on how you feel about Dempsey. If you like Greys Dr. McDreamy youll like Tom and the movie. If not? There are plenty of other nondescript romantic comedies out there from which to choose. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8974.

Like a shopworn wedding gown disguised with a new sash ""Made of Honor"" feels recycled from top to bottom. Thats because its essentially a gender-swapped version of ""My Best Friends Wedding"" the 1997 Julia Roberts megahit about a woman trying to sabotage her best pals nuptials once she realizes shes in love with him. The undermining duties here fall to ""Greys Anatomy"" star Patrick Dempsey in a predictably familiar role albeit one that should lure his female-dominated fan base. Theatrical honeymoon could be short however as McDreamy-obsessed fans and lonely singletons may prefer this romantic comedy as a chicks-night rental. Its the eternally optimistic unwed female population of course that explains Hollywoods seemingly inexhaustible litany of wedding comedies. With a few notable exceptions the formula is starting to resemble a dog-eared copy of Modern Bride lying around a nail salon For every legitimately hilarious and male-friendly ""Wedding Crashers"" there are a half-dozen anemic items like ""The Wedding Date"" and ""The Wedding Planner."" ""Made of Honor"" alas falls into that latter category. Scribes Adam Sztykiel Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont have generated a setup in which Dempseys confirmed bachelor Tom is at first completely blind to the long-harbored affections of his best friend Hannah (Michelle Monaghan). An aggressively cute college-set prologue explains Tom and Hannahs inauspicious first meeting. Mistaking Hannah for her roommate a drunken Tom crawls into her bed only to be doused with a bottle of perfume. Shes so appalled she insists she wouldnt sleep with Tom if he were the last man on earth. Flash forward 10 years By now theyre good pals. If the films internal logic and implied chronology are to be believed Tom would be about 31 for the remainder of the story -- a stretch considering Dempsey is in fact a handsome but weathered 42. But plausibility and verisimilitude apparently werent high on ""Made of Honors"" guest list. Its not so far-fetched that Tom and Hannah should become close friends after that initial encounter or that she despite her better judgment would develop feelings for this narcissistic Casanova. During their weekly lunches and strolls through Manhattan Hannah chides Tom about his rigid dating code no consecutive dates with the same girl no commitments -- and certainly no marriage. By now a successful entrepreneur Tom refuses to turn out like his father (Sydney Pollack) an irredeemable romantic on his sixth marriage. When an extended work obligation summons Hannah to Scotland Tom is astonished to discover how much he misses her. In a well-played scene that effectively mixes emotional awkwardness with physical pratfalls Tom plans to reveal his feelings to Hannah -- only to learn shes fallen hard for wealthy whiskey scion Colin (Kevin McKidd.) When Hannah asks Tom to be her maid of honor at her Scottish wedding just two weeks away Tom senses his only chance to intervene. And while planning a massive overseas ceremony in 14 days would be virtually inconceivable even if you have more money than Melania Trump its even harder to believe a manly guy like Tom would willingly brook the emasculating moniker ""maid of honor."" (Many real-life brides who involve close male pals in their weddings use ""attendant"" or the more anatomically correct ""best man"" -- less kitschy than ""maid of honor"" but of course far less useful as a source of double entendre.) Its pretty easy to predict the story beats from here Tom stumbles through his duties repeatedly offends the other bridesmaids and finds his way to Scotland where hell have to prove himself to Hannah if he has any chance with her. While helmer Paul Weiland maintains a grasp on the proceedings -- some of these scenes are fairly funny and pic skimps on neither acting talent nor production values -- its hard not to feel that weve already been there and done that. Thats particularly true for an actor of Dempseys caliber At his best when negotiating the fine line between pathos and comedy he should actively seek roles that demonstrate his range as he certainly deserves a better starring vehicle than this jalopy.

Hes foxy and a bit dangerous with merry dancing eyes and a way of caressing a barbed wisecrack just so. Patrick Dempsey is not quite that guy. He looks good but with a squinty gaze that doesnt radiate much light (he could be Sean Penns stockbroker brother). Hes sweet steady and likable but someone to count on rather than someone to sweep you away. All of which makes him perfect as the steadfast best-friend-whos-really-a-romantic in Made of Honor. When Tom (Dempsey) met Hannah (Michelle Monaghan) the two were at college and they ended up as buddies. After 10 years of palling around (and in Toms case sleeping around with sex bombs he treats nearly as badly as the movie does) he realizes that Hannah is the one for him. But shes gotten herself engaged -- to a towering hunk of a Scotsman (Kevin McKidd) whos like Daniel Craig on steroids -- and as a postfeminist lark she wants Tom to be her maid of honor. To win her over he seizes upon the emasculating role a process that starts out routinely but grows steadily funnier as the movie arrives in Scotland. (There are terrific running gags about brogues ghastly Scottish cuisine and DayGlo sex beads.) Made of Honor is a nice cookie-cutter comedy no more and no less but Dempsey with his relaxed charm and Monaghan with her soft and peachy sensual spark rise to the challenge of making friendship look like the wellspring of true love.
