Jason Bateman is the serious one (married kiddies lawyer stressed) Ryan Reynolds the dude (single womanising jobbing actor unfulfilled) and courtesy of a magic fountain from the Hot Tub Time Machine school of ironically dumb plot devices each gets to experience the others life. The films moralising agenda is swiftly apparent and pretty one-sided it is too since Batemans return to the bachelor lifestyle has him longing for hearth and home while Reynoldss preview of adulthood proves a wake-up call to embrace responsibility. All thuddingly obvious - though to be fair sundry outrageous comedy moments keep it lively enough in the meantime even if the spraying poo and porn-actress gags are more effortful than a spirited sequence where laidback Reynolds tackles childcare. Thanks to a likeable Bateman and a sterling Leslie Mann as his long-suffering/devoted missus it plays - though youd have to call the whole undertaking workmanlike rather than inspired.

By Peter Rainer Film critic August 5 2011 Save for later Saved Jason Bateman background and Ryan Reynolds are shown in a scene from The Change-Up. Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The ""Freaky Friday""-style premise of ""The Change-Up"" directed by David Dobkin brings together Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman as longtime buddies who end up inhabiting each others bodies and lives. Reynoldss Mitch is a gadabout slacker while Batemans Dave is an overworked lawyer with a stunning wife (Leslie Mann) and cute babies. Were supposed to accept the fact that each man secretly envies the others life even though the movie doesnt make a terribly good case for either mans existence (especially Mitchs).The switcheroo happens when after a drunken night out in which they urinate into a wishing pond the men wake up in each others bodies. (Whatever happened to ""When You Wish Upon a Star""?) From then on predictable consequences ensue leading up to the inevitable moment of realization that life was better in the original body.Bateman as always is surpassingly good even when the material isnt (as in the horrible ""Horrible Bosses""). Olivia Wilde has a slinky cameo as a legal assistant and Alan Arkin is onscreen too briefly as Mitchs exasperated father. He should be inhabiting another movie. Grade C+ (Rated R for pervasive strong crude sexual content and language some graphic nudity and drug use.)

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 5 2011 308 PM The Change-Up Ready for another icky sex comedy? By Dana Stevens After youve seen The Change-Up check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds in The Change-Up Im going to keep this short because I feel like Ive already reviewed The Change-Up (Universal Studios) at least twice this year. With slight variants this is another chapter in the epic saga of body shame gender panic and free-floating contempt for the human race that Hollywood comedies seem to be issuing piece by piece in serial format. Just Go With It Hall Pass and now this In film after grimly unfunny film men chafe at domesticity women whine about feeling neglected while displaying their near-naked gym-toned bodies and after some mishaps involving mistaken identity and feces heterosexual harmony is joylessly restored. The Change-Up directed by David Dobkin (who made the by-comparison-sophisticated comedy Wedding Crashers) isnt the worst of this recent run of anxious icky little sex comedies. The presence of Jason Bateman alone elevates it the merest notch above the abject Adam Sandler vehicle Just Go With It. Poor Bateman has been so underserved by his last few roles that his game professionalism is starting to look like saintly self-sacrifice. Before the opening credits have started to roll Bateman has taken a double faceful of projectile poo from a baby whose dilating anus gets a closeup worthy of Garbo. The joke Im about to make has probably already been made Bateman serves here as the audiences proxy; The Change-Up this opening announces is going to shit on us and well take it and like it. Advertisement Bateman plays Dave a lawyer at a white-shoe Atlanta firm who lives in a posh suburban mansion with his wife Jamie (Leslie Mann) and their three children. Daves an uptight workaholic who envies the wake-and-bake bachelor life of his childhood friend Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) a hunky aspiring actor who lives alone and entertains a rotating roster of sexually voracious women. Mitch a loner whos partially estranged from his father (Alan Arkin) covets his friends family stability ""Youre surrounded by people who give a shit about you."" Peeing into an outdoor fountain together after a night of heavy drinking the two men admit to each other ""I wish I had your life."" Body-switch premise activate. We never learn why this particular fountain possesses the ability or the desire to swap Daves and Mitchs identities--the female statue at the fountains center like the audience remains silent and expressionless throughout--but the men wake up the next morning with their respective consciousnesses lodged in each others bodies. Irresponsible Mitch must learn to diaper twins and negotiate a multimillion-dollar merger; Type-A Dave must contend with aggressive booty calls and a role in a soft-core made-for-TV porno. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I wont bombard you with all the indignities visited upon these characters by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore the writing team responsible for The Hangover. (Though it is worth noting that Leslie Mann has to play a moment on the toilet that makes the food-poisoning scene in Bridesmaids look like Chekhov.) The Change-Up might get away with being gross sophomoric and unoriginal if any of its three basic characters made a scrap of sense. Why do Jamie and Dave even associate with Mitch an awful person who leers at his supposed best friends wife and spouts nonstop profanities in the presence of their children? Why when her husband suddenly starts forgetting his childrens names and behaving bizarrely inappropriately does Jamie suspect hes having an affair--wouldnt it be more logical to wonder if he had a brain tumor or early Alzheimers? In short why are these people such blithering cretins? To call The Change-Up misogynistic would be to shortchange the equal-opportunity disgust this anal-regressive film demonstrates toward men babies old people and corporeal existence in general. Scene after scene seeks to elicit a collective cry of ""ew"" Pregnancy ew Plastic surgery ew Women with digestive tracts ew Forget about switching bodies; in this movies universe the real problem is having a body at all.

Batemans family life is at odds with Reynolds neer-do-well demeanor but you never know -- maybe theyll learn something in the process. Universal Studios hide caption toggle caption Universal Studios The Change-Up Director David Dobkin Genre Comedy Running Time 105 minutes Rated R for pervasive strong crude sexual content and language some graphic nudity and drug use With Jason Bateman Ryan Reynolds Leslie Mann Olivia Wilde Alan Arkin Watch Clips This Is A Suit This Is A Suit Credit Universal Studios Jamie Jamie Credit Universal Studios Poem Poem Credit Universal Studios The makers of The Change-Up know that youve seen this movie before. Two people spend a few days in each others shoes wacky situations ensue lessons are learned rinse repeat. Body-swapping comedies are the punctured wheel that Hollywood insists on trying to reinvent every few years and director David Dobkin with writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore want you to know right out of the gate that this ones going to be different. Their premise alone makes one change to formula doing away with the usual generational gap between the swappers and going with two men of the same age Dave and Mitch (Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds respectively). But how to really set your movie apart in the first five minutes? Digitally animated infant buttocks and projectile excrement should do the trick. With that visual The Change-Up firmly establishes itself as Freaky Friday for the Judd Apatow set and Dobkin pushes hard against the limitations -- few though they may be -- of the R-rating. As a result there are f-bombs shoehorned into as many lines as possible (no matter how awkward the context) additional excrement jokes beyond that gag-worthy opening scene and pages of homoerotic/phobic jokes relating to the fact that two male leads have not only switched bodies but are also now in possession of each others genitals. Add to that a surprising amount of nudity for a studio comedy almost all of it female and this is essentially a movie made expressly for sweaty-palmed teenage males. But dont be distracted by the dirty jokes. This is still body-swapping comedy by the numbers because despite Dave and Mitchs negligible age difference their maturity levels are easily generations apart. Dave is an ambitious career and family man a corporate lawyer about to make partner. His home life is as hectic as the office -- he and his wife Jamie (Leslie Mann) barely see one another as they juggle careers a young daughter and infant twins. Mitch is ostensibly an actor but is mostly a pot-smoker slacker and womanizer. His development was arrested at 15 while Daves has been fast-forwarded to around 55. i Daves wife Jamie (Leslie Mann) is an object of endless frustration for Dave and of barely concealed sexual longing for Mitch. For her part Mann isnt given much more to do beyond shed clothes and add to the films jokes-about-bodily-functions quota. Universal Studios hide caption toggle caption Universal Studios Daves wife Jamie (Leslie Mann) is an object of endless frustration for Dave and of barely concealed sexual longing for Mitch. For her part Mann isnt given much more to do beyond shed clothes and add to the films jokes-about-bodily-functions quota. Universal Studios The first scenes after the switch -- precipitated by each drunkenly wishing for the others life while urinating in a fountain -- rely mostly on comedy of mortification. Dobkin tries to see just how far down into your seat you can retreat as Mitch catastrophically attempts to pretend to be a lawyer and Dave shows up on the set of the soft-core porn movie in which Mitch is set to star. But the script values shock over wit so completely that every scene feels too eager for laughs even with comic actors as likable as Bateman and Reynolds doing the shocking. The movie does improve if only slightly once it settles down and finds its heart. Daves marriage really is crumbling and Mitch is watching life pass him by from his bed; both are in need of a wake-up call. But in trying to atone for its raunch The Change-Up overcompensates spending much of the final act lurching from smutty to schmaltzy as sight gags about freckled genitals exist alongside tearful monologues with cloying piano cues. Its difficult to find the unexpected in such an established template and its no mistake that the best films of this genre -- Big Being John Malkovich --are the ones that stray from the longstanding blueprints. The Change-Ups spin on the material transplants the same old house on a crumbled foundation trying to disguise its creaky familiarity with the gaudiest coat of paint possible.

JENNIE PUNTER Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 05 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Mar. 26 2014 329PM EDT Comments AA Directed by David Dobkin Written by Jon Lucas Scott Moore Starring Ryan Reynolds Jason Bateman Leslie Mann Olivia Wilde Alan Arkin Classification 14A Year 2011 Country USA Language English In The Change-Up hard-working lawyer and father Dave (Jason Bateman) and his best pal and professional slacker Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) wish they were each other while peeing in a public fountain after a night out drinking. For a moment the city lights black out. Its like the screen is winking at the audience because everyone knows what comes next. Multimedia The Change-up the official trailer Cast member Ryan Reynolds waves at the world premiere of the film The Change-Up in Los Angeles August 1 2011. Danny Moloshok/Reuters video Video Ryan Reynolds discusses The Change Up In this image released by Twentieth Century Fox Caesar the chimp a CG animal portrayed by Andy Serkis and James Franco are shown in a scene from ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes ."" The prequel ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes "" opening in U.S. theaters Friday features chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans crafted through performance-capture. Twentieth Century Fox/AP video Video Planet of the Apes rises at box office Sure enough Dave and Mitch roll out of their beds the next day and comically realize their wish has come true. It was probably inevitable that bromance would meet the body-swapping flick. The surprise perhaps is that The Change-Up is such a foul-mouthed affair.Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin and The Hangover co-writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore certainly try their darnedest to ensure The Change-Up steers clear of the family-friendly vibe typically associated with its premise. Before Reynolds gets to dazzle us with the first of his many profanity-heavy speeches for instance Bateman gets a mouthful of projectile baby poo. Freaky yes but definitely not Freaky Friday.Despite the swearing the raunchy humour and even a pair of knife-throwing babies however the movie cant help but move toward the same heart-warming conclusion as predecessors like Like Father Like Son Vice Versa and 18 Again In these movies the ""swappers"" are from different generations and spend most of their time apart gaining a deeper appreciation of each other. And the swap scenario typically plays out over one day filled with kooky comedy.But in The Change-Up Dave and Mitch discover it will take three to 30 days before they can learn the whereabouts of the magic fountain which has been removed for restoration. This frees them up to live in each others skin which requires them to consult frequently on such topics as baby care and booty calls.The filmmakers take advantage of this indefinite time span and cram the film with too many subplots. It takes forever just to get the guys to the fountain. Then of course theres the awkward early days during which the friends insult each others sexual partners and threaten each others careers (Dave is shepherding a major corporate merger while Mitch an aspiring actor has been cast in a soft-porn film).Far too gradually they begin to enjoy the rhythm of each others daily life. So much so that when its time for the movie to wrap up - because they find out where the fountain is - Dave and Mitch agree they both want to hold on for a bit longer.The Change-Up is made more tolerable by Bateman and Reynolds who squeeze more laughs out of the screenplay than it deserves. And Reynolds is particularly impressive playing Dave in Mitchs body - he makes you believe the silly ruse whereas Bateman merely adjusts the likable character he always plays. Rounding out the cast Leslie Mann ( Knocked Up) plays yet another high-strung whiny wife and mother easily given to tears. And Olivia Wilde plays a beautiful lawyer with a rocking body who likes getting tattoos drinking strong liquor and watching baseball.While theres some decent fun to be had in this fantasy world The Change-Up drags on so long you may need to ""visit the fountain"" before Dave and Mitch become themselves again.

Hilarity does not ensue.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune August 4 2011 -- 157pm Video (3305)  If theres one movie to avoid this summer its ""The Change-Up"" says film critic Colin Covert. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Following the release of its new film ""The Change-Up"" a body-swap comedy starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds Universal Pictures has filed for creative bankruptcy. ""The Change-Up"" is a comedy in which a married father accidentally switches bodies with his bachelor best friend leading to a series of zany complications. Industry observers called the film ""lame"" ""uninspired"" and ""a marathon of cliches."" The films shopworn premise familiar from films including ""Freaky Friday"" ""Vice Versa"" ""Like Father Like Son"" and ""The Hot Chick"" was only the latest warning sign that Universal had depleted its reserves of imagination. The troubled studios July 29 release ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" was seen by many as a failed effort to create a distinctive new hybrid by regurgitating stock materials from western and science-fiction films. The struggling studios plight reflects continued trouble in the wider entertainment sector which faces a continuing shortage of fresh ideas. Imagination-strapped studios have increasingly been turning to comic books action figures theme-park rides and even childrens board games for film ideas. Universal Studios president and CEO Ron Meyer speaking on condition of anonymity explained the studios strategy in releasing an uninspired film about polar-opposite friends who temporarily exchange identities. Richard Cartwright Universal Studios Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman in ""The Change-Up"" ""The guys swap bodies when they release some kind of mystical force by peeing in a public fountain. Thats new. Plus we thought it was edgy to cast Ryan as the cocky douchebag Jason as the uptight family guy and Leslie Mann as his whiny unhappy wife."" The film also features novel levels of profanity and scatology as both Reynolds and Bateman struggle with his newborn twins soiled diapers and Manns character eats too much Thai food. Torrance Calif. intellectual-bankruptcy lawyer Clove Citron said that while ""The Change-Up"" is particularly bereft of novelty all his film-studio clients are stuck in similar situations. ""The whole industry is creatively underwater. Its been generic sequels spinoffs and reboots all summer long and we havent even seen Final Destination 5 yet."" He noted that ""The Change-Ups"" screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore wrote ""The Hangover"" and its carbon copy ""The Hangover II"" adding ""you want originality hire the Coen brothers.""

"The Change-Up review What a raw deal |       NJ.com comments The Change-Up review What a raw deal Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 05 2011 at 812 AM View/Post Comments Jason Bateman left and Ryan Reynolds as friends who swap lives in aThe Change-Up.a The best rude comedies push things by being transgressive - which is different than simply being trashy. It was the face-to-face cattiness that made ""Bridesmaids"" work not the gross bathroom scene. It was the fact that Cameron Diaz was cursing out students (not just adults) that earned ""Bad Teacher"" its solid B. Movie rudeness has to have a rebellious iconoclastic spirit for it to be funny. Otherwise its just well rude. Its not a lesson that every raunchy comedy - and this is a summer overloaded with them - has learned. ""The Change-Up"" is one of those movies about two best friends who secretly envy each other. This one stars perennial nice guy Jason Bateman (as the settled married fellow) and button-eyed abs-of-marble Ryan Reynolds (as the sleep-around single character). One night they drunkenly wish aloud that they could swap lives. And before you can yell ""dude ex machina"" they have. Its a pretty obvious idea and its also pretty obvious early on that the filmmakers are in a race to the bottom. Want to see a baby defecate on dads face? Theyve got it. (Missed the shot? Dont worry theyll do it again - with dads mouth wide open this time.) And thats just in the first five minutes. Followed in short succession by scenes featuring a woman with diarrhea (that may be becoming a theme this summer) kinky sex with a colossally pregnant pervert an awful lot of porn and masturbation and vibrator jokes and plenty of references to our stars penises. At least some of this might be passable if the film were consistently funny. But like a drunk at a party its mostly just loud - and thinks thats enough. Bateman an effortlessly congenial actor does what he can with his Type-A attorney and Reynolds enjoys playing his supposedly outrageous friend (although most of what he says isnt daringly non-PC - its just appalling). And Leslie Mann a criminally underappreciated actress finds some almost-human angles to Batemans wife. But the movie has not even the slightest grounding in reality. Batemans a rich lawyer about to make partner Mann is designing skyscrapers and they dont even have a part-time nanny to help with their three kids? And when did the entire city of Atlanta get whiter than Pocatello Idaho? The films loose grasp of life as its lived might be forgivable if it had something else to offer. But Bateman and Reynolds never get into the hall-of-mirrors mimicry that Nicolas Cage and John Travolta so enjoyed in ""Face/Off."" And the script is painfully one-sided tacitly agreeing with the Reynolds character that husbands are henpecked wives are lonely shrews and family life can be a slow emasculating grind. Admirers of good acting should give Mann credit for doing a lot with a little. Admirers of Olivia Wilde should know that she shows up here and in far sexier situations than she had in ""Cowboys amp; Aliens."" But fans of good rude smartly dirty movies? Sorry. The summers best ones already came out. Ratings note The film contains nudity sexual situations strong language and drug use. The Change-Up (R) Universal (112 min.) Directed by David Dobkin. With Jason Bateman Ryan Reynolds Leslie Mann Olivia Wilde. Now playing in New Jersey.

The makers of The Change-Up tell us weve never seen the R-rated comedy version. Now its here and what The Hangover screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore have cooked up with Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin is nonstop raunch that decides too late that it needs to grow a heart. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> What The Change-Up has on its side -- and its not to be underestimated -- is a pair of livewires. That would be deadpan dynamo Jason Bateman as tight-assed Dave the family guy with three kids whose neglecting his wife (Leslie Mann always delectable) to make partner at his law firm. That would also be Ryan Reynolds (sorry about Green Lantern) who is at his loose Van Wilder best as Mitch Daves BFF -- a toking slacker softcore porn actor and perpetual thorn in the side of his dad (Alan Arkin of all Oscar winners). One night Dave and Mitch -- drunk off their asses -- pee in a fountain and wish they could trade places. Its a long pee -- was this film underwritten by Flomax? -- but the spell is cast. Thats Daves brain in Mitchs body enjoying close encounters of the kinky kind. And thats Mitch giving Daves stuffy wardrobe a makeover (""those shoes look dangerously Italian"") as he puts his career on a cliff. Its all a flimsy excuse for Bateman and Reynolds to break out of their respective boxes. Actually theyre not that different. As actors both lack the slob factor. I saw Mitch as an older Seth Rogen or a younger Bill Murray. No matter -- Bateman and Reynolds make The Change-Up seem a lot better than it is. Each earns a star in my review. The movie would be literally nothing without them.

(The change up) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday August 5 2011 400 AM Title The Change-Up An overworked lawyer and an irresponsible playboy switch bodies. With Jason Bateman Ryan Reynolds. Director David Dobkin (152). R nudity sex language drugs crude humor.  At area theaters.Did someone else temporarily inhabit Jason Batemans body when he signed the contract for ""The Change-Up""? Was Ryan Reynolds the victim of a mystical form of mind control? Because its hard to imagine a rational explanation for such a bizarre stumble from two savvy actors who should certainly have known better.The body-swap comedy can be done well as ""Freaky Friday"" has twice proved. But those instances are few and far between and this off-putting entry will be as swiftly forgotten as most of those that came before.As befits their images Bateman plays uptight family man Dave while Reynolds is the immature Mitch Daves bachelor BFF.  While relieving themselves in an apparently magical fountain one drunken night each wishes they had the others life. Lights flash thunder rumbles and our A-list stars suddenly find themselves sharing a concept previously embodied by Kirk Cameron and Rob Schneider.You already know how this goes Dave has an all-important meeting that Mitch cant screw up; Mitch was cast in a porn movie that now requires Daves er efforts. Mitch passes diaper duties off to Daves confused wife (Leslie Mann) and insults his law-firm colleague (Olivia Wilde); Dave fumbles dates Mitch has been setting up for months. Etc.The thing is this could have been funny. Its always amusing when Bateman lets loose and Reynolds is clearly ready to send up his ""Van Wilder"" roots. But director David Dobkin and his writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are primarily occupied with forcing mean-spirited gross-out humor into every possible scene. As a result the script--smug but never smart--barely scratches the surface of the movies actual potential. Both actors are game but Reynolds never even gets the chance to convince us hes become a conservative family man. And though Bateman is so reliably charming he single-handedly lifts the movie from disaster he had more opportunity to access his wild side on ""Silver Spoons.""Why Dobkin would hit the casting jackpot and then squander his winnings is a question that may never be answered. As for his leads heres hoping each regains his senses and swiftly returns to the well-planned life he was enjoying before this unfortunate mishap occurred.

Sporadically hilarious but more often just plain crass and contrived ""The Change-Up"" is a potty-mouthed update on those 80s body-swap comedies starring the overacting Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds as unlikely buddies who are magically forced into each others radically different lifestyles. Dave (Bateman) is a workaholic millionaire lawyer who dotes on his three young children -- one squirts poop in his mouth in the disgusting opening scene so you may want to skip dinner beforehand -- but neglects his beautiful long-suffering wife (Leslie Mann). Mitch (Reynolds) is a hedonistic marginally employed actor who freely indulges in sex and drugs. An improbable reunion of these childhood friends leads to a night of revelry capped by public urination in a fountain where their drunken wish for each others lives is granted -- much to their mutual horror the next day. (The film is set in Atlanta for no discernable reason except possibly a hefty tax abatement.) PHOTOS STARS BATTLING THEMSELVES AT BOX OFFICE Irresponsible Mitch is appalled at reporting for work every day at a law firm in the guise of Dave and is arguably even less well-equipped to take care of the kids. (Why such a wealthy lawyer and his wife who live in a trophy home dont have a nanny is a never-addressed issue.) A scene where computer imaging is deployed to depict infant twins imperiled by various sharp kitchen objects because of Mitch-as-Daves negligence is more bizarre than actually funny. In return uptight Dave-as-Mitch is humiliated to find himself cast in a ""light porn"" movie -- and worse discovers that Mitchs latest insatiable bedmate is eight months pregnant. The women in these episodes bare their breasts as does Ms. Mann. The guys of course get to keep their pants on. Reynolds does drop more F-bombs than in any major movie in recent memory -- possibly more than Robert De Niro in ""Raging Bull."" The biggest laughs in the erratic script (by the authors of ""The Hangover"") come from gay-panic jokes revolving around this bromantic couples handling of each others borrowed penises. The writers and David Dobkin who also directed the far funnier and fresher ""Wedding Crashers"" make us wade through a whole lot of contrived plot to get to those moments. Theres not much suspense surrounding a key issue Will Mitch-as-Dave sleep with Daves wife whom hes long crushed on? And will Dave-as-Mitch do the deed with Daves incredibly hot secretary (Olivia Wilde of ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"")? There is also a subplot involving Mitchs dad but someone unaccountably forgot to give Alan Arkin anything funny to do. As in Judd Apatows phallocentric comic fantasies the considerable raunch and implicit sexism of ""The Change-Up"" barely mask a worldview thats far from transgressive. Theres little doubt that in the end Mitch will learn responsibility while bringing home a billion-dollar merger and a promotion for Dave. And that through his bacchanals Dave will learn to be slightly less of a workaholic -- as his wife generously laughs away any suggestion of a career change that might lead to a less lavish lifestyle. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Starr report Read Next Starr report Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46764 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20339 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17970 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Starring Ryan Reynolds Jason Bateman Olivia Wilde Leslie Mann Director David Dobkin Running time 153 Release Opened Aug 5 2011  Editorial Review Trading places but staying vulgarBy Ann HornadayFriday Aug 05 2011""Freaky Friday"" meets ""The Hangover"" in ""The Change-Up"" a raunchy ode to guy-love in which Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds struggle valiantly to transcend the movie theyre in. Sometimes they do - especially Reynolds who after the disastrous ""Green Lantern"" here displays the same rom-com chops that made him so yummy in ""The Proposal"" a couple of years ago. As an arrested adolescent and incorrigible ladies man named Mitch Reynolds has most of the funniest lines in ""The Change-Up"" many of them vulgarities aimed at infants who smile beatifically at the verbal abuse. When another youngster asks Mitch if hell come to her dance recital he tells her the only dance performances he attends ""involve a big shiny pole and a broken woman with daddy issues."" Then Reynolds makes a lower-lip-out frowny face which exemplifies why hes at his best when he can keep it light and just riff. Bateman doesnt get to have nearly as much fun as Mitchs straight-laced bestie Dave a type-A lawyer with a beautiful wife (Leslie Mann) and three kids. For the most part hes called on to turn on his signature nervous grimace while being asked say to have an intimate encounter with a buxom womans nether regions on the set of a porn flick or have another intimate encounter with a woman whos nine months pregnant. Those are but two of the long series of sex- and scatology-oriented set pieces that comprise ""The Change-Up"" wherein Mitch and Dave switch bodies early on and must impersonate each other until they can switch back. Like ""Horrible Bosses"" ""Bad Teacher"" and ""The Hangover Part II"" this hard-R comedy brazenly seeks out the most rancid vulgar graphic form of lowbrow humor (not surprisingly the script was written by ""Hangover"" veterans Jon Lucas and Scott Moore). But give ""The Change-Up"" credit for making its aesthetic known early on when Dave blearily becomes the target of projectile baby poop aimed not just at his face but into his mouth. Although Olivia Wilde co-stars as Daves comely legal assistant this is primarily a vehicle for the same veiled homoerotic impulses that drive the bromantic-comedy genre (witness the recurring motif of Mitch giving Dave instructions in the care and grooming of his nether-regions). But director David Dobkin (""Wedding Crashers"") seems not to have encouraged Bateman and Reynolds to try harder to inhabit each others mannerisms and personae; once they switch they dont really change which feels like a lost opportunity for actors with their comic chops. As it is the audience must content itself with baby poop naughty words and the female anatomy at its pneumatic extreme while Bateman and Reynoldss search for transcendence continues.Contains pervasive strong crude sexual content and profanity some graphic nudity and drug use.

The latest body-swap comedy a la Freaky Friday 17 Again and fill in the blank reaches into the gutter time and again and proves remarkably efficient in coming up with slime.But the truth is I kinda liked it. So consider this review as a stab at figuring out why.Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds are actually funny as each other. Bateman starts off as Dave a henpecked lawyer who gets squirted with baby poop in the movies first scene. Reynolds plays his buddy Mitch a slacker-bachelor who picks up women at Lamaze classes. After a night of drinking they urinate into a fountain utter some magic words about trading lives and wake up the next morning with wishes granted.Bateman is a hoot as the lady-killer id sinking his teeth into a role far from his usual smirking straight man. His face loosens up his eyes open wide his arms gesticulate. Try this math Bateman + Reynolds = Charlie Sheen. I swear it works.Heres the really frustrating thing Moments after noting a despicable strain of hypocrisy in The Change-Up I found myself cozying up to its wiles. Its one of those movies that tempers its gross-out instincts with touchy-feely moments and attempts to reflect genuine emotion. Horrible right?After a while I started rooting for the characters. I wanted Dave/Mitch to comfort Daves neglected wife played by Leslie Mann used to man-child surroundings as part of Judd Apatows repertory (shes his wife). I wanted Mitch/Dave to earn the love of Mitchs dad (Alan Arkin) and charm the young hottie (Olivia Wilde).Yes The Change-Up perpetuates the all-or-nothing responsible-or-pathetic dichotomy with which the American comedy has lately saddled the male gender. Its crude. Its simple-minded. It also has a laugh-out-loud spoof of a ""lorno"" shoot (thats soft porno) and it ends up getting the gist of what it might be like to be someone else. It put me in a good mood after a long day.In other words I didnt hate it. Not even close. Even if part of me thinks I should have.The Change-UpC+ Starring Jason Bateman Ryan Reynolds Leslie Mann Olivia Wilde and Alan Arkin. Directed by David Dobkin.

"Bateman Reynolds underused in overdone Change-Up - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Bateman Reynolds underused in overdone Change-Up By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated Comments Reprints amp; Permissions The Change-Up needed a few more script revisions before hitting theaters. Like Crazy Stupid Love its an uneven comedy whose best moments offer a glimpse of its potential. By Richard Cartwright Universal Pictures Dave (Jason Bateman) left and Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) get their wish after they relieve themselves in a public fountain. EnlargeClose By Richard Cartwright Universal Pictures Dave (Jason Bateman) left and Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) get their wish after they relieve themselves in a public fountain. The Change-Up opens with a cringe-inducing scene in which Jason Bateman as a harried dad gets a mouth full of poop while diapering a baby. After the diaper change the movie has nowhere to go but up. Batemans earlier summer comedy Horrible Bosses was more consistently funny though he and Ryan Reynolds have a chemistry here that grows more pronounced as the movie progresses. Unfortunately the tired gags grow pronounced too. Dave (Bateman) and Mitch (Reynolds) grew up together but took different paths. Dave is a workaholic lawyer at a prestigious law firm and Mitch is a struggling actor/pothead slacker. Dave is married to Jamie (Leslie Mann) and the father of three young children; Mitch is an overgrown teenager. After a drunken night out they urinate in a fountain under a statue of a Greek goddess and slurringly proclaim ""I wish I had your life."" Surprise They get their wishes and wake up in each others bodies. After the predictable jokes about their divergent male anatomy the bigger conundrum is how to carry out each others daily lives until they can reverse the switcheroo. Think an R-rated Freaky Friday with dudes. The movie attempts to meld the overdone body-switch formula with raucous Judd Apatow-style comedy but doesnt fully succeed. Reynolds and Bateman are far better than the material theyve been given to work with. The Change-Up should have fired on all cylinders. Director David Dobkin helmed the very funny Wedding Crashers and screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore wrote The Hangover. What went wrong here? About the film The Change-Up   out of four Stars Ryan Reynolds Jason Bateman Leslie Mann Olivia Wilde Alan Arkin Director David Dobkin Distributor Universal Pictures Rating R for pervasive strong crude sexual content and language some graphic nudity and drug use Running time 1 hour 52 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The writers rely excessively on bathroom humor. Mitch is too extreme painted as the most irresponsible of guys. But its never explained why. He wont have a meal with his dad (Alan Arkin) but we dont know what their back story is. Its hard to believe hed be so clueless and boorish when he goes into Daves office. He stuffs his pockets with free food and acts like a 12-year-old during a formal meeting. If hes a struggling actor hed at least know how to act like a businessman. Reynolds can make almost any character likable and his Mitch/Dave has some humorous moments. Still its hard to buy his extreme persona. And by the end that character seems to have disappeared entirely replaced by a bland facsimile. Its fun to see Bateman usually the straight man let loose and embrace some aspects of his pals uninhibited wildness. Both emerge with charisma intact rising above the underlying schmaltzy message. Its one of the toughest tasks to make a consistently funny comedy but so much of The Change-Up feels lazy and familiar the bachelors refrigerator filled with moldy former foods crazed unannounced booty calls and an important presentation derailed causing officials to sputter threaten firing and stomp out in a huff. While this raunchy Freaky Friday meets Trading Places has some laughs its more often frat-boy crass frantic and formulaic. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

By Joe Morgenstern August 5 2011 ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" traces the roots of the venerable franchise back to a single resident of contemporary San Francisco a supersmart simian named Caesar. In the process the film which Rupert Wyatt directed from an audacious screenplay by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver rises above its dramatic deficits boosts the collective IQ of this summers movies and swings into flights of kinetic fantasy that blow the collective mind. (If you think youve had it with special effects wait till you see Caesar and his ape army battling our befuddled species on the Golden Gate Bridge.) ENLARGE The chimpanzee Caesar leads an army in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Twentieth Century Fox The story takes a while though an intriguing while to hit its stride. James Franco is Will Rodman a hard-charging scientist trying to find a cure for Alzheimers. The drug he comes up with seems to do the trick and then some--for his father Charles (an affecting performance by John Lithgow) whos suffering from the disease and for a baby chimpanzee whose mother was involved disastrously in the drug trials. Charles starts playing Bach like a latter-day Glenn Gould and little Caesar as Will chooses to call him shows every sign of becoming a world-class brainiac. The drug it turns out boosts intelligence exponentially though there are complications. If there werent apes might never have risen en masse and Charlton Heston whos seen in a fleeting clip on TV might have found litter on the beach instead of the Statue of Liberty. This is a Frankenstein myth for our time set at first in the gleaming laboratories of a large pharmaceutical corporation. Surprisingly though its also a family saga thats funny and intense as well as refreshingly irony-free. Will becomes the loving parent Caesar lost not to mention the cause of all sorts of grief to both species while Caesar becomes the hero of a movie that truly is about a chimp struggling to grow into the fullness of his powers. Just as the action sequences couldnt have been done without digital technology the heros nuanced characterization couldnt have been achieved without a motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis who manages wordlessly--well almost--to render unto Caesar almost as wide a range of feelings as he revealed with the help of words when he played the madly malign little Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings."" A good thing too because Wills range seems narrower notwithstanding Mr. Francos efforts and most of the other human characters are stick figures clothed in zestful cliches. Freida Pinto doesnt even get to do zest as Caroline a primatologist who falls in love with Will or maybe with Will and Caesar alike. Her role consists mainly of issuing warnings. ""This is wrong Will"" she says at one point. ""Youre trying to control things that dont want to be controlled."" And later ""There are some things that cant be changed."" Ill issue a mild warning of my own--dont judge the film on neatness. The plot keeps jumping chimplike between San Francisco and a preposterously huge primate shelter in nearby San Bruno with a lyrical interlude in Marin Countys redwood forest. The script is unconcerned with what Will and Caroline do when Caesar isnt looking and Will seems oblivious for the longest time to the question of finding a habitat for Caesar thats more suitable than a converted attic. Judged though as the action extravaganza it means to be ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" wins high marks for originality and takes top honors for spectacle. (The senior visual effects supervisor was Joe Letteri who won four Oscars for his work on ""Avatar"" ""The Lord of the Rings"" films and ""King Kong."" Andrew Lesnie was the cinematographer.) Its not just how many apes fill the screen--zombie movies marshal digital hordes as a matter of course--but what they do as a phalanx led by Caesar and as astonishingly specific individuals. The primate shelter becomes the scene of an epic jailbreak. Swarming chimps turn San Francisco into a surreal circus. The opposing forces on the bridge could be Cossacks (our side) versus revolutionaries with a superhuman--all right nonhuman--gift for martial acrobatics. The film was shot in two dimensions with no need of a third and comes and goes in not much more than an hour and a half if you subtract the extremely long closing credits. Thats revolutionary too a summer spectacular both thrilling and brief. The Change-Up Watch a clip from from ""The Change-Up"" starring Jason Bateman Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde. ENLARGE Jason Bateman and Leslie Mann in The Change-Up. Universal Studios Lets give this ghastly studio comedy a Truthiness in Advertising award if nothing else. In the movie Jason Batemans earnest lawyer and family man Dave gets a faceful of feces while changing a diaper. The trailers dont fully capture the moment but at least they suggest it with a quick cut to a brown smudge that should serve as a vulgarity alert. Or for the target audience a vulgarity guarantee since thats what the production is peddling and what it delivers. The pretext is a shopworn plot in which Dave and his best friend Mitch a heedless hedonist played by Ryan Reynolds magically switch bodies. The transfer occurs when the two men talk about envying each others lives while relieving themselves in a public fountain. This leads to reasonably clever situations every now and then--both actors do their best with hollow roles--and to some insight into how Dave and Mitch are seen by others. But the main attraction is how far the film will go in grossing us out and it goes so far that you may quickly identify with Daves baby son who keeps banging his head against the side of his crib. (Thats supposed to be funny like every other dumb and offensive thing in the movie including two ways to spoil sex with beautiful women.) The director was David Dobkin who did a raunchy and genuinely funny movie called ""Wedding Crashers"" six years ago. He worked from a script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore; they wrote the hilarious ""The Hangover"" two years ago. Olivia Wilde is Sabrina an alluring law associate. Leslie Mann suffers in more ways than one as Jamie Daves wife. Talented people all and either prisoners of the studio system which will do anything it takes to reach an audience or willing players in a soiled playpen. The Whistle Blower Watch a clip from ""The Whistleblower"" about a Nebraska cop played by Rachel Weisz who outed the U.N. for covering up a sex scandal. Ive watched with fascination and dismay as Rachel Weisz and the woman she plays Kathy Bolkovac have hit the talk-show circuit on behalf of this film about sex traffickers in wartime Bosnia. Fascination because both women are so intelligent and articulate and the story they describe is so compelling but also dismay because the screen version is so clumsily didactic and flat. Ms. Bolkovac was a police officer in Nebraska when she signed a lucrative contract to become a peacekeeper with the United Nations. Unfortunately for her the arrangement made her an employee of a U.N. contractor rather than a U.N. functionary with appropriate power and international agencies along with local cops proved to be complicit in the prostitution rings she endeavored to break up. Unfortunately for the film which describes itself as having been inspired by actual events the first-time director Larysa Kondracki and her screenplay collaborator Eilis Kirwan took their most obvious inspiration from the tricks and tropes of other films. Ms. Weisz is always a strong presence but her talents are wasted here on a naive heroine--the fictional Kathy is exceedingly slow to grasp the extent of the corruption--and a narrative style that turns the horror of the prostitutes plight into harrowing melodrama. Vanessa Redgrave is a spectral presence in the strangely truncated role of Kathys mentor. Bellflower Watch a clip from ""Bellflower"" a film about two friends who spend all their free time building flame-throwers and weapons of mass destruction in hopes that a global apocalypse will occur and clear the runway for their imaginary gang ""Mother Medusa"". A daring feature debut by Evan Glodell ""Bellflower"" looks like it was shot with the digital equivalent of a Brownie box camera and generates an almost palpable aura of anxiety. In addition to directing from his own screenplay Mr. Glodell portrays Woodrow an eerily cheerful young man who with his buddy Aiden (Tyler Dawson) plays at preparing for the apocalypse popularized by Mel Gibsons ""Mad Max."" Woodrow and Aiden arent mad in any literal sense of the word theyre simply obsessed by the scruffy mythology to the point of building their own flamethrower and modifying an old muscle car so that flames bellow forth from its stacks. Then playtime turns sinister and violent. While the flames may be an expression of repressed sexuality the movie as a whole is anything but pat. Its a dark vision neither readily described nor dismissed of friends with no stable selves living bleak lives that make no sense. DVD FOCUS Monkey Business (1931) ENLARGE The Marx Brothers of course in one of their funniest comedies. Groucho Harpo Chico and Zeppo are stowaways on an ocean liner. Theres no plot to speak of only steady-state chaos that involves among many other things rival gangsters and the brothers efforts to avoid the captain and crew. The cast includes Thelma Todd and Tom Kennedy. This was the first Marx Brothers film to be written for the screen (by S.J. Perelman of The New Yorker magazine fame Will B. Johnstone and Arthur Sheekman). The director was Norman Z. McLeod. Charly (1968) Cliff Robertson won an Oscar for his role as the mentally challenged Charly Gordon who thanks to experimental surgery becomes a genius with an IQ thats off the charts. The productions mawkishness is off the charts too. No one tells the hero that the loftiness of his intellect wont last and the movie milks the cheesy tragedy for all its worth. Claire Bloom is Charlys teacher. The cast includes Lilia Skala Ruth White and Dick Van Patten. Ravi Shankar did the music. Ralph Nelson directed from Stirling Silliphants adaptation of ""Flowers for Algernon"" a short story by Daniel Keyes. Swept From the Sea (1997) Rachel Weisz is Amy a pagan water spirit and radiant outcast in Beeban Kidrons romantic fantasy based loosely on a Joseph Conrad short story. Amy exults in pelting rain (her lipstick survives some of the worst weather since ""Wuthering Heights"") and hides humble treasures from the sea in her own secret grotto. Vincent Perez is the hot-eyed Yanko an outcast too and the seas greatest gift to Amy. Sometimes ""Swept From the Sea"" teeters on the brink of self-parody. Yet the film has the courage of its florid convictions. It sweeps you up and carries you away.

"Chicago Tribune Michael Phillips Change-Up review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Change-Up When acting isnt enoughBateman Reynolds cant self-efface their way out of this messAugust 04 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticRyan Reynolds and Jason Bateman in ""The Change-Up.""The occasion was a bedroom farce as they used to call them from a more buttoned-up era. When the comedy ""Any Wednesday"" opened on Broadway in 1964 Walter Kerr reviewed a then-unknown Gene Hackman and noted memorably the actors ""wonderfully light-footed habit of stepping off a joke before it begins to complain."" Isnt that an exquisite description of an actors timing and demeanor?Now flash forward to 2011 and the hard-R body-switching comedy ""The Change-Up"" which has nothing to do with ""Any Wednesday."" The movie directed by ""Wedding Crashers"" alum David Dobkin isnt very good. A lot of it in fact is hacky and repellent.But though neither Jason Bateman nor Ryan Reynolds -- playing a workaholic lawyer and his longtime bongaholic Lothario buddy respectively -- may be the next Gene Hackman the actors shared interest and self-effacing skill in finding the correct internal rhythm of a scene make ""The Change-Up"" tolerable. And theres your blurb quote for the DVD release ""Tolerable"" (Phillips Chicago Tribune).Peeing in a fountain one drunken evening in downtown Atlanta (whatever its not worth the sentence to explain it) the friends utter ""I wish I had your life"" in the same instant which is enough apparently at least in Atlanta to launch a fantasy wherein Reynolds foul-mouthed would-be actor switches bodies with Batemans uptight joyless family man.Leslie Mann is the neglected wife who wonders whats up with her husbands newly crass behavior; Olivia Wilde currently in ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" plays Batemans legal colleague who is everything (dishy available a Braves fan etc.) except interesting.Some comedies have the knack for affrontery and shock value; ""The Change-Up"" written by the ""Hangover"" team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore merely has the will to offend with scenes such as Bateman-in-Reynolds being forced to perform in a ""light porno"" project. I was more put off by the digitally juiced sight gag of an infant boy banging his head against his crib over and over and over and over. And over. Also does ""The Change-Up"" set some sort of record for both digitally and prosthetically enhanced breasts? If so does that distinction make the movie any funnier?No but the cast does what it can. Bateman (he of the vaguely preoccupied air always) and Reynolds (a choirboy with devils horns) hot-foot every exchange so that theres moment-to-moment pace at least in this conceptually lazy films favor.mjphillipstribune.comThe Change-Up -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (pervasive strong crude sexual content and language some graphic nudity and drug use)Cast Ryan Reynolds (Mitch); Jason Bateman (Dave); Leslie Mann (Jamie); Olivia Wilde (Sabrina); Craig Bierko (Valtan); Alan Arkin (Mitchs dad)Credits Directed by David Dobkin; written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore; produced by David Dobkin and Neal H.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies The Change-Up Body Swapping Plus Fake Boobs and F Bombs Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds trade bodies but this comedy does little to switch up a familiar movie formula By Mary Pols MaryPolsAug. 04 2011 Share Read Later Richard CartwrightDave played by Jason Bateman struggles with his twins in The Change-Up Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture After 1976s Freaky Friday Hollywood began spitting out body-swap comedies so regularly that the routine of horrified characters feeling themselves up in their suddenly older younger or differently gendered bodies has practically become an annual event. Everyone from Steve Martin to Lindsay Lohan has done it. While contributing nothing to the cause of creativity these movies hit a happy nerve dependably slapstick and guaranteed to reinforce the message that it wouldnt hurt to be either more or less whimsical that being yourself is a good thing. The Change-Up from Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin and written by The Hangover scribes Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is raucous and entertaining but unexciting. It distinguishes itself from the others by not particularly distinguished means a headlong rush to an R rating. The two disparate characters swapping places are old friends Dave (played by Jason Bateman) and Mitch (Ryan Reynolds). Mitch is an idiot who swears incessantly; every other word out of his mouth begins with f. (No one swears as gratuitously as Mitch unless he or she has a disorder.) The movie takes what is a fleeting pleasure -- seeing the typically straitlaced Bateman use that word even around children -- and makes it a lingering (and boring) theme. (Rise of the Planet of the Apes See why its chimpan-tastic) Mitch is a lot like Phil Bradley Coopers Hangover character but without the respectable job wife and kids. Successful Dave has those. Hes a lawyer on the brink of a deal that could make him partner. Hes married to Jamie (Knocked Ups Leslie Mann) and is father to a young daughter (Sydney Rouviere) and adorable baby twins. Mitch has aspirations to be an actor with a swinging sex life but hes a quitter while Dave is a workaholic who never learned to embrace quitting time. There are some gross but comically effective reveals and the movies fish-out-of-water scenes are horrible and funny at the same time. Reynolds has his moments -- the lecture he delivers (as Dave) on the rules of marriage is his shining moment. But in part because Bateman is the stronger comedian and in part because Mitchs single life is surprisingly dull the sequences at Daves house have more energy. Watching Bateman sling around a pair of insanely cute babies like bags of flour is frivolous good fun. Frivolity is the point. No one is supposed to sweat the details of The Change-Up like how or why Mitch and Dave swapped places (they expressed envy of each others lives while peeing in a fountain together). Its the reactions that matter like Mitch/Daves disgust when he wakes up to the sight of Jamie breastfeeding in bed. (Manns prosthetics may develop their own fan base.) Mitch and Dave expect that as soon as they can replicate the circumstances of the switch everything will go back to normal. Where do they get that confidence? Safe to say from the movies. ""This is freaky"" Mitch/Dave says in a tossed-off reference to the mother of the genre. Forget foul language and topless women if a filmmaker really wanted to radicalize the body-swap movie one swapper would end up in a mental ward while the other spent all his money and slept with his wife. (Box-office report See why Cowboys amp; Aliens got Smurfed.) But within The Change-Ups predictable parameters theres a kernel of truth about the worn-out friendship at its center. If Mitch and Dave were women theyd be called frenemies. They stick together out of habit even though Mitch thinks Dave is a tool and Dave thinks Mitch is a jerk. Neither meant his pronouncement at the fountain. ""I was just trying to be nice"" Dave says. Mitch suspects that his old friend is ""embarrassed of"" him. The movie would have been darker nastier -- and stronger -- if theyd taken the opportunity to toy with each others lives a bit more. Case in point what are the chances Dave will use Mitchs waxed muscular body to finally to sleep with Sabrina (Olivia Wilde) the colleague hes been lusting after? Bateman as Mitch is all for it explaining that it wouldnt be infidelity because Dave would be using Mitchs body -- ""Ive got your [penis] right here in my pants."" Still I sat through The Change-Up wishing that the characters would take more advantage of their opportunities. Movies like this and the early-2011 release Hall Pass put the boobs right in front of the guys (and the audience) and then show them backing away. All this titillation followed by the triumph of dutiful family values wears on you. The Change-Up tries so hard to be scandalous that its a shame it doesnt do more to change up the formula.

Their streams cross if not their light sabers and zap - body-swap Dudes and dudettes we give you The Marriage Crashers Trapped in Daves body Mitch gets a taste of changing diapers and showing up at work. In Mitchs body Dave gets to sleep all day and play all night. Directed by David Dobkin (The Wedding Crashers) from a script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (The Hangover) The Change-Up is potty potty-mouthed and poopier than a nursery full of toddlers fighting toilet training. On the plus side Bateman Reynolds and Leslie Mann (as Daves underappreciated wife) are reliably funny and Olivia Wilde (as Daves legal intern) actually plays a human (as opposed to whatever the heck life-forms she is supposed to be in Tron Legacy and Cowboys amp; Aliens). Like the kids in detention The Change-Up wants to offend your sensibilities. It sets new records for scatological humor and profanity. You know about the poop. Also know that the F-bomb gets fired so often you might get strafe marks. Also know that there is much stoner humor. At the same time the film drums the familiar beats of body-swap films such as Freaky Friday and body-switch films such as Big. These stories are about why the grass seems to be greener and how it feels to walk a mile in the other guys shoes. This is what Dave learns When you have to fertilize it the grass doesnt look greener. This is what Mitch learns When theyre a size too small the other guys shoes hurt your feet. The benefit of the body swap is that each fully sees himself when hes in the others skin. Naturally this gives each lead the fun of playing his character and playing his character trapped in the others. Reynolds runs the gamut from trash-talker to bashful and is as funny as he was in The Proposal. Bateman seesaws from self-effacing to scrofulous and is as out there as he is in Horrible Bosses. Too bad the performances get flushed away in the toilet humor. The filmmakers are under the mistaken impression that in order for a gag to work the audience should gag from the gross-out situation.

Why do so many Hollywood sex comedies hate sex so much? This year alone weve already had ""No Strings Attached"" ""Friends with Benefits"" and ""Hall Pass"" three movies that overtly state that all carnal relations between two consenting adults are icky and soul-crushing if they take place outside of the blessed state of matrimony or at least couplehood. These movies entice audiences with storylines that promise to be about freewheeling mature sex unencumbered by guilt or convention but by the final reel you can pretty much bet the farm that a rings going on someones finger or that chastened spouses will learn their lessons. Who needs a production code when studio movies about the humpty-hump have all the bravado and recklessness of your maiden aunt Gertrude? The latest of these morality plays ""The Change-Up"" starts out with a hard-R ""Freaky Friday"" premise -- button-down dad and lawyer Jason Bateman changes bodies with irresponsible chick magnet Ryan Reynolds -- and pretty much sucks all the potential fun out of it as quickly as possible. Batemans Dave has worked his way up from poverty but even though hes got the house three kids and hot wife Jamie (Leslie Mann) as well as a law partnership within reach he cant turn off his work ethic long enough to enjoy life or even give Jamie an hour a week devoted to actual conversation. Meanwhile Daves lifelong best bud Mitch (Reynolds) lives like a frat boy struggles to get acting gigs and purports to have an endless stream of babes coming in and out of his apartment. One drunken night the two urinate into a fountain and simultaneously wish for each others lives and wouldnt you know it the next morning theyve gone all ""Like Father Like Son"" or ""Vice Versa"" or ""Dream a Little Dream"" or whichever is your favorite body-switching movie. And then... Well not much actually. Mitch learns the usual lessons about familial responsibilities and opening himself up to love although the movie miraculously teaches him how to be a really good lawyer as well suddenly taking over Daves complicated merger deal with no legal training outside of some ""Law amp; Order"" reruns. Dave meanwhile having endured long periods of marital bed-death looks forward to the idea of responsibility-free sex but winds up choking once he realizes that he and Mitch have very different taste in women. (Suffice it to say that Mitch trawls Lamaze classes for single mothers.) The script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (""The Hangover"") is a mess -- it strives to juggle bawdy smuttiness with violin-section sentimentality resulting in unfunny incoherence. (Poor Leslie Mann gives a genuinely heartfelt and witty performance as a woman desperate to regain her husbands attention but it feels beamed in from an entirely different movie.) Worse still the writers cant even get their body-switching mechanics right Dave and Mitch have the requisite scene where they try to explain to Jamie whats happened to them but since Dave bobbles her questions about their anniversary and Jamies favorite color shes not buying it. This conversation then apparently completely flies out of her mind because hours later Mitch-as-Dave cant remember their nightly dinner song and he mispronounces their daughters name and Jamie just gets mildly peeved. Shouldnt she at least accuse him of trying to maintain the charade that bodies have been switched? Theres also at least some degree of misogyny at play in ""The Change-Up"" -- Olivia Wilde is the only actress here who gets to disrobe without being humiliated; otherwise we get Mann taking a violent bowel movement a topless pregnant woman whose babys kicks are visible through her stomach and an over-the-hill porn actress whose surgeried visage and ridiculously artificial breasts are played for laughs. Bateman and Reynolds do what they can with the material but since both actors possess such a dry deadpan comedic style the prospect of them playing each other doesnt yield the comic possibilities of one of them trading places with say Will Ferrell. Bateman seems to be having fun with the kind of crass potty-mouthed character that doesnt usually come his way and he makes the most of the physical-comedy moments involved with Mitch-as-Dave trying to figure out how to feed and diaper two yowling twin babies. ""The Change-Up"" like so many American movies feels like the product of sex-phobic 12-year-old boys whose response to the big bad world is to run back to mommys leg. And if the movie were about that panic itd be one thing but instead its the never-addressed elephant in the room -- or rather the bra and panties on the bed that get picked up giggled over and then flushed down the toilet.

Comments click to enlarge The Change-Up Video Rated R  112 minutes  2011 High-living bachelor and occasional porno actor Ryan Reynolds and his longtime best friend a straight-arrow husband and lawyer played by Jason Bateman stumble across a wish-granting statue and end up swapping bodies to frequently lewd sometimes amusing but rarely surprising effect. Though advertisers are trying to sell this as a comedy dream team of sorts with the writers of The Hangover (Jon Lucas and Scott Moore) joining forces with the director of Wedding Crashers (David Dobkin) the real summit meeting here may be between the two leads. Theyre good at their specialties--Reynoldss casual jock studliness and Batemans nervous white-collar introversion--and theyre even better at switching into the other guys shtick and mannerisms.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Richard Cartwright) Change-Up Naturally funny stars help predictable Change-Up BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Aug 5 2011 (...) Richard Cartwright In this publicity image released by Universal Pictures Jason Bateman is shown in a scene from ""The Change-Up."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Richard Cartwright) Richard Cartwright In this publicity image released by Universal Pictures Jason Bateman left and Ryan Reynolds are shown in a scene from ""The Change-Up."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Richard Cartwright) Richard Cartwright In this publicity image released by Universal Pictures Jason Bateman background and Ryan Reynolds are shown in a scene from ""The Change-Up."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Richard Cartwright) The funny thing about humor is how subjective it is. Different things are funny to different people -- or to the same person on different days.Ive seen ""The Change-Up"" twice. The first time it seemed more daring than recent misbehavior comedies like ""Horrible Bosses"" and ""The Hangover Part II."" The second time I changed identities with somebody smarter and realized that a lot of the laughs relied on redundant swear words and gratuitous nudity. I still think its a funny movie but given its genes its a bit of a slacker.As noted in the ads this body-switch comedy is from the director of ""Wedding Crashers"" (David Dobkin) and the writers of the original ""Hangover"" (Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who are not to blame for the formulaic sequel). More importantly it stars the naturally funny Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds. Bateman plays Dave a buttoned-down Atlanta lawyer with a multitasking wife named Jamie (Leslie Mann) and three kids including twin toddlers. When the first scene of the movie includes projectile poop theres reason to worry that Bateman is back in the rut of playing a put-upon Everyman. But when he sneaks away for a night at a sports bar with his bachelor buddy Mitch (Reynolds) they express their mutual envy -- and then magically exchange bodies.Once our skepticism wears off (and the guys inexplicably stop trying to tell Jamie whats happened) the pleasure of the movie is watching the two typecast actors flip the script. Bateman is especially good when idiotic Mitch masquerades as Dave to complete a big business deal. Meanwhile Dave-as-Mitch shyly dines with Daves legal assistant (Olivia Wilde) and worries whether Jamie prefers the assertive imposter whos sleeping in his bed. Bolstering the behavioral humor are some guilty-pleasure gags involving unattractive naked people and misbehaving babies. An impressive percentage of the gags hit their target on the outside edge but when they become predictable the movie makes a desperate call to the bullpen for a sentimental closer. Like too many comedies of this sort ""The Change-Up"" mistakes a late-inning lob down the middle of the plate for a curveball.""The Change-Up"" Two and a half stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 141  Content Nudity sexual content drug use and pervasive strong language Videos Watch a trailer for The Change-Up Aug 4 2011 (...)

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Before establishing Jason Batemans character as an overachiever of Obama-like dimensions the ridiculous new body-switch comedy The Change-Up feels the need to drop a giant clump of baby shit into his mouth. Before it can build Bateman up it must first tear him down. Its only the latest in an endless series of comic humiliations that have followed Batemans strange welcome evolution from has-been 80s-sitcom actor to peerless cinematic straight man. In The Change-Up Bateman has a hot wife (Leslie Mann) beautiful family great car and amazing career but he nevertheless exudes desperation. Metaphorically and otherwise life has been shitting in the mouth of what should be a perfect existence--but in the not-so-grand tradition of body-switch comedies one that could be so much more. The Change-Up lazily typecasts Bateman as a type-A coffee achiever up for a big promotion at work and Ryan Reynolds as his unlikely best friend a pot-smoking super-slacker actor leading a sweet life devoid of accomplishment or commitment presumably at the expense of loving-but-distant father Alan Arkin. For reasons far too stupid to go into the friends switch bodies and must learn how to navigate through the rocky currents of each others suspiciously eventful lives. David Dobkins film has the faults of raucous recent scatological comedies like Bad Teacher Horrible Bosses and The Hangover Part II with none of their redeeming facets. Its scattershot sexist and vulgar without being funny a masturbatory fantasy for the Maxim set with a Manic Pixie Dream Girl of a love interest (Olivia Wilde) whos all about baseball whiskey being one of the guys and no-strings-attached sex. This is only a fantasy for boys Theres a painful scene where Reynolds trapped in Batemans body callously tells Mann he isnt attracted to her any more after she unleashes a particularly explosive fit of diarrhea. (The Change-Up has shit on its mind throughout.) Its a jarringly brutal unnecessary sequence in whats supposed to be a light comedy. In moments like this the films ugliness bubbles to the surface unobscured by laughs plausible human emotion or sympathetic characters.

On the other hand familiarity with both body-switch comedies and Judd Apatow laffers is indispensable for understanding just where this raunchy Apatow imitation with a heart of Lipitor goes wrong. The anatomy swappers here are Mitch (Ryan Reynolds) a swingin irresponsible single guy and Dave (Jason Bateman) a driven lawyer/husband/dad. The switcheroo goes down because the two buddies-since-childhood do something stupid during a Guys Night Out in their hometown of Atlanta They pee in a fountain. Specifically they pee in a fountain presided over by a stony statue of the Greek goddess Metis while drunkenly declaring to each other ""I wish I had your life"" (For the record Metis is the goddess of counsel advice planning and cunning.) Dave thinks he envies Mitchs life of free sex and fiscal irresponsibility. Mitch a wannabe actor thinks he envies Daves successful career his loving home life and his cute wife (Leslie Mann). Crash lightning temporary power outage Freaky Friday The deal is done. The next day each guy wakes up in the body of the other. Discovery of genital distinctions follows. Heres The Change-Ups first mistake As set up by director David Dobkin (Wedding Crashers) and writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (The Hangover) the game is rigged. Dave may be burned-out so much so that he has stopped appreciating his squeaky Leslie Mann of a wife. He may even feel a pang or two of extramarital lust at the sight of his beautiful law associate Sabrina -- as played by Olivia Wilde who wouldnt? But no one would envy Mitchs directionless idiotic Peter Pan life -- even if Peter entertains the ladies in a playpen of an apartment. The early Mitch is so excessively unsocialized and unlikable (I blame the script and direction rather than Reynolds game performance) that theres no contest Dave may need a little kick in the khakis to realize that hes got it pretty good at home but hes clearly the movies winner. In fact early Mitch is so obnoxious that in the end when the two friends regain their own bodies having learned lessons in gratitude (oops did I give something away?) Dave is more or less Dave again. But Mitch 2.0 bears little resemblance to early Mitch. Hes still Ryan Reynolds-y but hes now someone a lot more like Dave -- reformed by the traditional values The Change-Up endorses -- than like a guy who previously kept a weekly sex date with a lady he described as a tigress. I wont give away more about the tigress in question; lets just say she bounces and veers from Hangover turf into Farrelly brothers territory. And she also personifies The Change-Ups second mistake The movies scenes of id-fueled transgression are alternately desperate trite and an off-putting color of ugly -- as if the filmmakers were given the ingredients but not the cooking instructions for a successful crude-but-cuddly frittata. Gross-outs involving poop -- kids of all ages usually love em -- are more humiliating than hilarious. (Really the old toxic-baby-diaper gag?) Freakish-looking women are easy receptacles for disgust. And when jokes give way to the ""I love you bro"" finale the tone oozes past charming happiness all the way to cloying self-satisfaction. Anyway Theres one consolation and thats in watching the stars play opposite what is ? often their type of guy. Bateman in particular is enjoyably nimble and unbuttoned when he sheds his usual persona of responsible-and-exasperated guy and lets some devil out. Quick-witted and a pro at physical shifts he finds more subtleties in his Dave Gone Wild than actually appear in his dialogue. And that resourcefulness rubs off on Reynolds a pleasant if less complex performer. Acting here as if he were a vaguely disgruntled but resigned grown-up Reynolds gets to escape the tonal confines of his boyish smile. Too bad The Change-Up has little use for such interestingness. Soon enough its back to stale jokes about spousal date nights the sight of moldy fast-food leftovers in a bachelors refrigerator and the timeless male joys of sharing a whiz in an outdoor fountain after a night of drinking and bulls--.

The Change-Up Bad to Fair Director David Dobkin. Cast Jason Bateman Ryan Reynolds Olivia Wilde. Rating R for pervasive strong crude sexual content and language some graphic nudity and drug use. This weeks new movie releases Yes the switched-identity plot has been done to death but there was a certain measure of hope involved with ""The Change-Up"" because it stars Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman. Both are funny actors enjoyable in pretty much everything they appear in. Give them a good story and a smart script and you cant go too far wrong. Ah but theres the problem. Although ""The Change-Up"" director David Dobkins film about a playboy and a family man who magically change bodies wants to be the latest in the R-rated gross-out-comedy-with-a-heart-of-gold sweepstakes the script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore ultimately goes the sappy route instead. Jason Bateman wants to direct Top 10 films about switching identities This is not to say that a sweet payoff isnt a worthy thing. It is. But when that payoff is basically the same as ""Arthurs Perfect Christmas"" a PBS childrens holiday cartoon yet not as satisfying thats a bad sign. Reynolds and Bateman do what they can and have some funny moments for sure. But eventually they like the movie get bogged down in the oddly gooey plot. Dave Lockwood (Bateman) is an attorney about to make partner in a prestigious firm as soon as he closes a deal thats all but done. He has a beautiful wife Jamie (Leslie Mann) and three children. But hes a little envious of his best friend Mitch Planko (Reynolds) a would-be actor who whiles away his days getting stoned and having all kinds of sex with all kinds of women. When contrasted with Dave one of whose kids poops IN HIS MOUTH while hes changing a diaper Mitchs life sounds pretty good. And Reynolds is particularly good at this kind of thing doing and saying anything for a laugh as the ultimate slacker. One night Dave and Mitch go out drinking and decide to relieve themselves in a fountain in the middle of a park. While bemoaning their own lives they simultaneously wish they had each others. And when they wake up Dave is in Mitchs body and Mitch in Daves. (Life lesson public urination never leads to anything good.) Too much time is spent ensuring that events will conspire to keep them this way for a while (oh you know about 101 minutes). Which means that Mitch will have to seal the deal with the law firm while Dave will have to learn to relax and if he wants to live up to Mitchs reputation have lots of deviant sex. But hell also have to go on a date with Sabrina (Olivia Wilde) who works for Dave at the law firm. So Mitch will have to grow up and Dave will have to relax. No surprise there. Nor is it a shocker that neither man is particularly good at being the other at least at first. What is surprising is how saccharine the plot grows as each man learns his lesson. If it sounds like ""Freaky Friday"" with (lots and lots of) F-bombs thats about right. Everyone in the movie is game for something better - besides Reynolds and Bateman Mann is dependably funny and Wilde has fun as the bad-girl-in-hiding. But its hard not to be disappointed with ""The Change-Up"" which in the end follows the basic conventions of the switched-identity genre if more profanely changing up not much at all.

"Change-Up The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; change-up-the ) Change-Up The (United States 2011) August 03 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Change-Up has designs of being the next big raunchy comedy of the Summer of 2011 following on the heels of Bridesmaids The Hangover Part II Bad Teacher and Horrible Bosses. However while theres sufficient profanity sex nudity and excrement to justify the R-rating its hard to argue that The Change-Up pushes envelopes. Distilled to its basics its little more than a sit-com that has been tarted up with scenes of projectile poop odd sexual fetishes and knife wielding babies. It all seems a little tired and more importantly not as funny as it should be. I have heard The Change-Up described as ""Freaky Friday for adults"" which is grossly inaccurate (accent on ""gross""). The only thing The Change-Up has in common with Freaky Friday (both the original and the remake) is that both involve body swaps. This is an old and not well-regarded genre. Most of its entries are horrible a few are watchable and its hard to come up with one that lives up to its potential. It should be noted that The Change-Up is not Like Father Like Son bad but neither does it set a new standard for this kind of movie. Tone down the profanity limit the kinky sex and this would make a passable 9 p.m. weekly network TV show. I wouldnt watch it but I dont watch much TV. The Change-Up spends a little time setting up best friends and polar opposites Mitch Planko (Ryan Reynolds) and Dave Lockwood (Jason Bateman). Mitch is a confirmed bachelor who lives in a hovel of an apartment spends his time sleeping late and smoking weed has sex with a new woman seemingly every week and is pursuing a career he loves acting. Dave on the other hand is in a stagnant marriage with Jamie (Leslie Mann) has three children (two toddlers) and works a high-profile law job that consumes his time. One night while watching a baseball game on TV at a bar the two express mutual envy. Later while pissing in a fountain they re-iterate their ""grass is always greener"" feelings and magic happens. The next morning Mitch awakens in bed with Jamie and Dave opens his eyes alone in Mitchs hovel. They spend the next hours screen time trying to figure out how to get back in the right bodies then 30 minutes wondering if thats what they really want. The screenplay credited to Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (the writers of The Hangover) is mediocre. There are some funny moments but not enough of them to justify a nearly two-hour running length. Shock humor that worked in The Hangover is not as effective here. Theres only so much mileage one can get out of the word ""fuck"" before it becomes repetitious. Director David Dobkin who is probably best remembered for Wedding Crashers (and less kindly for Fred Claus) does not have a deft comedic touch - his is more the sledgehammer variety - but hes good enough to milk a few laughs from some of the more outrageous scenes. The acting however gives some life to an otherwise unremarkable production. Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman dont merely mug for the cameras - they imitate each other in unfamiliar bodies and are entirely convincing. Mitch and Dave are consistent characters regardless of who is playing them; this is a credit to the actors. Leslie Mann also provides a solid performance that walks the tightrope between comedy and melodrama; its an affecting portrayal. Olivia Wildes part as the co-worker for whom Dave has the hots is underwritten but she fits the bill of looking great in and out of her clothing. The Change-Up may be remembered as the first movie in which the concept of ""screen nudity"" has been redefined. As this movie proves no longer is it necessary for an actress to remove her clothing to appear naked. CGI can create more ""ideal"" breasts than implants; that happens on several occasions here. How much of the nudity is real and how much was lovingly crafted on an artists computer? The filmmakers arent talking but theres an artificiality to more than one shot that reminds one of photoshopping except in this case its recreation rather than merely touching up. The Change-Up isnt a complete failure - its an adequate re-exploration of a genre that was worn out in the 1980s - but the lack of an edge is its undoing. A barrage of profanity is not inherently funny. Tastelessness does not equate to comedic genius. The film takes chances but pulls back unwilling to venture too far into the dark territory where The Hangover wallowed. The ending wraps everything up in neat packages complete with bows and ribbons. The attempts at drama - especially regarding Daves growing recognition of how much his family means to him and his reaction to Jamies tearful confession when hes in Mitchs body - are half-baked. We grow to care about the characters but no so deeply that were likely to remember them after the end credits have rolled. The Change-Up is a comedy and were in the audience to laugh. To that end it delivers but with limitations. Its sporadically funny but the humor isnt consistent. As a harmless forgettable throw-away night out this is adequate but as a Big Summer Movie its a disappointment.

"The Change-Up is an Infantile Mess of Frat House Fantasy | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movie The Change-Up is an Infantile Mess of Frat House Fantasy The incompetent and filthy offspring of <i>Freaky Friday</i> and <i>Hall Pass</i>. By Rex Reed  08/02/11 732pm Bateman and Reynolds. The charm versatility and charisma of Jason Bateman and the camera-ready good looks of Ryan Reynolds should add up to more than a piece of crummy amateurish junk called The Change-Up. But what else can a discerning filmgoer (I naively presume perhaps foolishly there are a few of those left) count on from bogus director David Dobkin (Wedding Crashers) and sub-mental screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (The Hangover)? Expect an overwhelming surfeit of incompetence and filth. In this one-joke frat house masturbatory fantasy about two guys who exchange bodies for no reason except to keep a DOA movie going for almost two hours even the title makes no sense. There is no such thing as a ""change-up."" I could understand ""change-over"" or ""trade-off"" but the invasion of one persons persona into another persons frame is not a ""change-up."" Never mind. Nothing else jells in this farrago of idiocy either. Mr. Bateman is Dave a battered but responsible lawyer husband and father of three including a pair of twins who hasnt had a good nights sleep in months. Mr. Reynolds his best friend since the third grade is Mitch a pot-smoking womanizing free-spirited bachelor-model-actor (a nice 21st century way of saying ""irresponsible unemployed jerk""). He is a symbol of a former life Dave would like to re-live. Dave hasnt had time to have sex with his own wife while Mitch says things to trashy women like ""Id like to strap you to my face and say the alphabet."" One night after a ball game and a few joints they pee in a fountain and wish they could trade places. Miraculously they wake up the next morning in each others bodies. Now it is gentle responsible family man Dave who is talking like a drunken Marine and hangover king Mitch who is forced to attend law firm briefings and burp babies covered with vomit and diapers filled with what looks like chocolate pudding but isnt. The conceit is they look like themselves but talk and act like each other. Dave arrives on a movie set looking like Mitch but to his conservative button-down horror it turns out to be a porno film with another mans finger up his orifices. When the kinky Mitchs sexy new squeeze shows up for wild uninhibited sex with Dave who looks like Mitch she is nude and nine months pregnant. Meanwhile Mitch in Daves body tries to keep from sleeping with his best friends wife Jamie played by Leslie Mann wife of no-talent Judd Apatow and one of the worst actresses in B-movies. Remember her opposite pardon-the-expression Adam Sandler in the abominable Funny People? I couldnt understand a word she said in that fiasco and she hasnt learned a thing since. She sounds like shes got a mouth full of cotton swabs stuffed in sideways. The Change-Up drags on endlessly held together with scatology flatulence and masturbation. Everybody gets a chance on the toilet with all the noise and disgust that graphic bathroom scenes entail. When Mitch tries to teach Dave how to be Mitch by shaving everything off below his Speedo line and Dave feeds Mitchs ego with more penis-envy jokes than a bunch of sailors in a locker room the contrivances pile up like a tower of dominoes. Here is a minor idea with minimal possibilities for mistaken identity routines plummeting into mind-numbing confusion.  Sooner than you can search the second hand on your watch to see how much more of this you can take you forget if you are watching Dave in Mitchs body or vice versa. Its worth a chuckle or two to see Mr. Bateman get a chance to be crazy and gregarious but when will somebody give him a role with some stature? In this sorry waste of time his energy gets all mixed up with Mr. Reynolds pecs and who cares? I finally threw in the towel when Dave in the body of Mitch and Sabrina the sexy law intern in Daves office (played by Flavor of the Month Olivia Wilde) who thinks shes on a date with Mitch both get their genitals tattooed.

If ""Freaky Friday"" had an impudent foul-mouthed little brother it would be ""The Change-Up"" an often needlessly crass bromance-oriented spin on the body-swap comedy. While the reliable Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman wring some laughs from a creaky but durable setup playing polar-opposite buddies who find themselves by stepping outside themselves the script takes R-rated gross-out humor to such forced extremes that its later bid for sentimental sweetness feels disingenuous and unearned. Easily marketable cast and concept should help this Universal release shake some change out of moviegoers not yet exhausted by this summer of gratuitous vulgarity. The generally bottom-feeding nature of the material here should come as little surprise to those who recognize the raunchy imprimatur of ""Wedding Crashers"" helmer David Dobkin and ""The Hangover"" scribes Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (though the writing duos more salient credit may be the supernatural-tinged 2009 comedy ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past""). At various points ""The Change-Up"" seems intent on setting a new record for F-bombs dropped per minute and it hits a nadir early on with the image of a principal character getting hit in the face with projectile poop while changing his kids diaper. The guy performing that thankless task is Dave (Bateman) a straight-laced family man struggling to raise three kids make his wife Jamie (Leslie Mann) feel appreciated and desired and seal a major deal at the firm where he works as a corporate attorney. By convenient contrast Daves closest friend Mitch (Reynolds) is a pot-smoking sexually hyperactive layabout with no job and little relationship with his disappointed father (Alan Arkin). After a night of booze-soaked commiseration Dave and Mitch relieve themselves in a public (and magic) fountain an act of minor desecration with major consequences. After the unpleasant shock of realizing theyve switched bodies wears off the mutual benefits of the arrangement come into focus Dave will get to relax and have sex with one of Mitchs many girlfriends while Mitch will have to handle some responsibility for a change and have sex with Jamie (despite Daves protests). Since neither scenario would square with the films eventual endorsement of monogamous commitment multiple instances of pre-coitus interruptus ensue. Throughout ""The Change-Up"" one senses the filmmakers revived this hoary chestnut of a tale so they could deliver the crudest version possible -- a bawdy-swap comedy if you will -- more to satisfy presumed market demands than to maximize the storys potential. Thus along with the expected farcical moments of topsy-turvy romance and job-performance catastrophe we get a monologue about genital electrocution a bizarre fetish involving pregnant women a scene of noisy gastrointestinal release and a few whose-penis-is-it-anyway jokes that are admittedly pretty funny. Far more repugnant is a scene that grotesquely exaggerates the perils of parenthood using fake-looking CGI to place sharp instruments in the hands of not one but two toddlers. Its awfully hard to swallow family values from a film whose idea of humor frequently borders on child abuse. While superior entries in this subgenre have tackled the battle of the sexes (""All of Me"") or the generation gap (the various versions of ""Freaky Friday"") ""The Change-Up"" is less-than-hilariously predicated on a clash between opposing lifestyles. In order for this particular dichotomy to work the two leads would have to be convincing as buddies to begin with; as it is Mitch comes across as the sort of overgrown frat boy Dave would have ditched eons ago on his road to social respectability. The fact that Reynolds is seven years younger than Bateman and looks it only reinforces the sense that these two are somewhat mismatched their amusing back-and-forth rapport notwithstanding. Bateman usually cast as the straight man (as in the recent ""Horrible Bosses"") has fun unleashing his id in a few indulgently coarse pep talks; by contrast Mitchs transformation lets Reynolds stick with his familiar smart-and-sensitive persona. But because the actors are not especially dissimilar comedic types to begin with swapping identities doesnt allow them the sort of virtuoso displays of physical comedy this sort of material typically affords. On the distaff side Mann whines and scolds in roughly the same unhappy-wife role she played in ""Knocked Up"" and ""Funny People"" though she bares more of her body here if not her comedic gifts than she did in either of those pics directed by her husband Judd Apatow. Giving the material an unexpected jolt is the exquisitely beautiful Olivia Wilde (also in the current ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"") who brings a tart breathily self-assured presence to an underwritten role as Daves legal assistant. Pacing is brisk and tech credits are fine with nary a single pop-scored character-development montage out of place.

TWITTER Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds star in director David Dobkins R-rated comedy. Other than Big back in 1988 and the two Freaky Friday films body-switching comedies rarely pan out. All those plot mechanics and far-out magic just to deliver a foregone conclusion that the grass isnt necessarily greener yada yada yada. The Change-Up bravely attempts to revive the dormant subgenre but its a lame effort that grows increasingly frantic and foul-mouthed as the realization sets in that the gimmick isnt working. With Ryan Reynolds Jason Bateman the lovely Leslie Mann and current ""It girl"" Olivia Wilde co-starring the R-rated comedy from Universal should enjoy a solid opening weekend and may wind up with the positive box-office numbers of Batemans other R-rated comedy this summer Horrible Bosses. What entertainment the film offers is that of the familiar and inevitable. Audiences can anticipate every plot turn well in advance and the outcome is never in doubt. The fun if you will lies in seeing Reynolds and Bateman playing each others characters in the wrong body and thereby fouling up their respective lives. If they met today Mitch (Reynolds) and Dave (Bateman) would never strike up a friendship. But they grew up together and although they also grew apart -- hugely apart -- the bond sticks. Mitch is a man-child frat boy who refuses to mature. He does claim to be an actor but this clearly isnt a lucrative pursuit. Dave is an anal-retentive overachiever a hard-working attorney closing in on a partnership with a grand home in Atlanta an adoring wife Jamie (Mann) and three great kids -- although the infant twins assure him of steady sleeplessness. During a night of inebriated revelry the boys do what needs to get done in a body-switching comedy Each grows envious of the others life. Mitch longs for a loving family and stable career while Dave realizes he has worked so hard he missed out on all the ""drugs sex and bad choices."" While urinating into a public fountain late that night -- there is more pissing and defecating in this movie than in a teen comedy -- they wish they could switch lives and a somewhat malevolent looking fountain grants the wish. The following day Mitch (as Dave) wakes up lying next to Jamie while Dave (as Mitch) awakens amid the rubble and half-eaten takeout food strewn about Mitchs bachelor digs. Panic ensues as the two desperately try to fit into a bewildering new life style. Mitch takes over high-stakes merger talks with a Japanese firm that blow sky high when he clearly knows nothing about the deal and insults the other side. Dave finds himself acting all right -- in a porn film. Each does discover some compensation in his new life Mitch is aroused by Daves incredibly sexy colleague Sabrina (Wilde). Dave once he extricates himself from that porno finds he actually has time to read a book and visit the aquarium. The film engineers scenes in which the men learn what people really think about them as well as situations that prompt re-examination of values. But writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore never find a way of making these predictable developments funny. Their overused escape route is wildly inappropriate behavior and potty-mouths. That an irresponsible Mitch would demean women and endanger childrens lives is perhaps understandable. But that Ivy League grad and top lawyer Dave would emulate his immature pal defies credibility. Yet as the writers grow increasingly insecure about their dialogue situations and characters the f-bombs multiply and the juvenilia escalates. Director David Dobkin who deserves credit for instigating the modern R-rated comedy with Wedding Crashers in 2005 aims for a similar vibe here by directing scenes as broadly as possible while enrolling his male stars in the Jerry Lewis School of Overacting. But Wedding Crashers had a unique premise and somewhat original characters. The Change-Up suffers from a trite story and rote personalities. It even manages to utterly waste one of the best comic actors alive Alan Arkin in a throwaway role as Mitchs perturbed dad. The use of the urban playground of present day Atlanta is banal It looks like the location scout picked up a tourist map at the airport. Theres no sense that this story is taking place in the new South. All sites are nondescript the actual setting depending entirely on what city offered the best incentives. Productions values therefore are professional but unremarkable.

When sober Dave begrudgingly tolerates Mitchs wild-animal routine. One night when both are drunk Dave admits hes secretly jealous of Mitchs life of reckless indulgence. Grass greener etc. ""You come home every day and youre surrounded by people who give a shit about you"" Mitch exclaims not for the first time betraying his soft spot for Daves wife Jamie (Leslie Mann). ""What more could you ask for?"" Ask a stupid question etc. Daves answer ""I want to have sex with strangers""This mutual envy established Dave and Mitch wake up the next morning having exchanged bodies thanks to some mechanics involving a stroke of lightning and public urination--all of it hazy enough that it makes one long for the comparative narrative clarity of the magic Native American Tabasco sauce of Like Father Like Son.Directed by David Dobkin (whose workmanlike brand of broad Dudes Gone Wild comedy can also be seen in The Wedding Crashers and Fred Claus) The Change-Up might not be terribly interested in explicating exactly how pissing can activate the transfer of a soul from one corporeal vessel to another but then its also not terribly interested in souls. What it is interested in is piss not to mention corporeal vessels--the ugly realities of bodies and the fluids they excrete.This is hit-or-miss stuff. For every genuinely productively strange conversation between Dave and Mitch about one or the others penis (one of which happens simultaneous to a legitimately gonzo set-piece involving two toddlers running amok in a spectacularly un-baby-proofed kitchen) there are seemingly three gags centered on the simple fact that shit literally happens. But at least this scatological focus undeniably unexpectedly tweaks the basic tropes of the switcheroo flick (such as the WTF? moment of recognition here made literal when Bateman looks into a mirror and exclaims ""What the fuck??"") with a kind of horror-comedy built around men in their late 30s confronting the basic facts of bodily function as if for the first time.A rare R-rated entry in a genre usually geared to teens The Change-Up pivots on the discrepancy in life experience and hipness between an adult and an adolescent and uh distinguishes itself by maintaining an extreme puerile worldview while finding a way to wedge ""adult language"" into virtually every sentence. Also theres at least one instance of nudity for every actress with more than one or two lines. For the trouble of disrobing all of these female characters are rewarded with sexual rejection in two cases because their male partners are horrified to learn that women have working assholes. One of these women persecuted for defecating is played by Mann who as usual is so naturalistic that her characters humiliation is actually heartbreaking.That essentially is The Change-Ups trajectory from shit to schmaltz. ""We have to use this"" Mitch says through Daves mouth. But par for the course attempts to capitalize on their mystical accident turn the two bros into Better People. Dave and Mitch use one anothers bodies to launch journeys of self-discovery. Their involuntary disguises allow them to learn what people really think of them and instead of the restoration of manhood each hoped for--sexual for Dave professional and familial for Mitch--the men get their egos further bruised and are reminded of their manly deficiencies in ways that make them desperate to redeem their real lives.Once Dave and Mitch work out all their shit (metaphorically speaking) and some kind of order is restored the only thing left to do is confront their latent longing for one another. The films final dialogue exchange reveals The Change-Up to be one long setup to a bromantic joke that in a roundabout way maybe comes closer than any previous film to fulfilling that woebegone subgenres implicit homoerotic endgame. In a film about two straight men coming to terms with their true selves while being forcibly confronted by their fear of anal function its almost a surprise these guys stop just short of actually Doing It.
