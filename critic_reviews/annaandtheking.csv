Foster has never been particularly drawn to romantic roles but here speaking in a clipped British accent her small-boned beauty swathed -- at times buried -- in lush Victorian finery she spars nimbly with the outrageously charismatic Chow Yun-Fat who plays the King as a tender if lordly matinee idol. Foster seems to be working hard to swoon and to hold on to her dignity at the same time. To a degree she succeeds. The scene in which Anna and the King twirl across the ballroom floor scandalizing a diplomatic dinner as they gaze into each others eyes hits just the right note of refined desire. Yet Anna and the King isnt structured to bring this famous cross-cultural attraction to a sumptuous romantic payoff. Stuffed with period detail and deep-dish political intrigue as if it were trying to be a prestige American version of The Last Emperor the movie is intelligent vividly shot and weirdly remote. Its a painstakingly correct update of what is lets face it one of the least culturally correct love stories ever to be mythologized by Hollywood. In The King and I Yul Brynners statuesque monarch with his staccato brusqueness and shockingly virile chrome dome was a stern barbarian tamed by (Western) love as embodied by Deborah Kerr. In Anna and the King the two title characters dont quite fall in love; they fall into deep mutual respect a state that for the audience at least proves deeply unsatisfying. We need to feel the passion simmering beneath Annas feisty schoolmarm facade but Foster as always acts from the head more easily than the heart. By the end the King with Annas help has stanched a military invasion and thrown off the shackles of colonialism. For all I know that gets closer to the real story so forgive me if I prefer the fake one.

Starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat. Directed by Andy Tennant. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As ""Anna and the King"" passes the two-hour mark a viewer cant be blamed for hoping that Chow Yun- Fat the cigar-puffing king will break into an energizing chorus of ""Shall We Dance."" The ambitious film comes close but no cigar. Before it runs off track this latest nonmusical saga of the strong-willed English widow who teaches the king of Siam a thing or two does have some spectacular moments. The re-creation of the Grand Palace is a wonder and so is Jodie Foster as Anna. Former Hong Kong action superstar Chow (""A Better Tomorrow"" ""The Corruptor"") is a dignified and warm presence as the king. The irony is that the story is weakest when it takes a ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" turn and requires him to leap into action. Foster a famously single mother plays a widow alone with her son in an alien culture in the mid-1860s. Clear-browed but narrow- lipped and rather plain Anna is principled and uptight and feels she has been tricked into coming to tutor the kings son and heir. Not only does it appear she will not get the house outside the palace she was promised she must tutor all of the kings school- age children -- and he has 58 with 10 more on the way if all his wives and concubines are keeping track. She is called ""sir"" because no other woman dares stand in the presence of the king. He is accustomed to kowtowing and total obedience. Anna not only considers herself an equal but is also subversive. She introduces the prince to Harriet Beecher Stowes abolitionist novel ""Uncle Toms Cabin"" -- half a world away there is civil war in the United States. Anna also perhaps unwittingly passes along a message to the kings newest concubine from the girls lover now a monk. This battle of wills is familiar to anyone who has seen Rodgers and Hammersteins ""The King and I"" or even 1946s ""Anna and the King of Siam"" with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison -- based on the diaries of Anna Leonowens whose actual experience has been highly fictionalized in all these versions. What makes this one different -- apart from a degree of spectacle not seen before -- is that more is made of the king as a shrewd political strategist protecting his countrys interests. Siam (now Thailand) had never been colonized like its neighbors Burma (by the British) and Indochina (by the French). In one particularly effective scene an oafish Englishman a representative of the East India Company publicly insults the king. There is another bloody difference from the musical Death squads from Burma are a constant threat and the Siamese suspect they are backed by the British. But this story is essentially a romance including its exotic locale. The presentation of the palace its rituals and the cultural clash are all fascinating leading to a platonic affair that can never amount to more than an exchange of looks between Anna and the king. When political treachery is added to the mix it makes for an awkward fit -- and a long one. The emotional climaxes come and go before the film finally winds down. Annas reaction when the king offers her the gift of a ring is extraordinarily handled by Foster but the ending when in finally arrives doesnt carry similar weight. The simulation of the Grand Palace is surely spectacular even if it does look brand new. If it seems not to be part of Bangkok but to rise out of the jungle its because the film was shot in Malaysia. Thailand refused to cooperate. ""Youre an interesting mix of fact and fancy"" the king tells Anna which is also true of this movie and one of the reasons it will likely be banned in Thailand. There the monarchy is held in greater respect than probably anywhere else in the world -- certainly more so than in England. No version of this story has ever been commercially shown in Thailand although in this video era tapes of ""The King and I"" are circulated. In ""Anna and the King"" a clear effort has been made to present the historical King Mongkut in a respectful light played by an esteemed Asian actor and avoiding the simplifications of the musical. Well know shortly if doing the right thing will be enough for audiences. ..

But her performance is contained in a schmaltzy ultra-elaborate overly long production. The lovely Jodie Foster makes a valiant effort at bringing a contemporary edge to the role of 19th century schoolteacher Anna Leonowens in ""Anna and the King"" the third version of the popular tale previously filmed as a black-and-white drama ""Anna and the King of Siam"" in 1946 and as a Rodgers and Hammerstein film musical ""The King and I"" in 1956. But her performance is contained in a schmaltzy ultra-elaborate overly long production all too consciously conceived as an old-fashioned family entertainment. Critics will squabble over this hodgepodge of a movie which diffuses several of the storys racial sexual and political tensions but pics flaws and undemanding nature will work in its favor at the box office. This Fox Christmas release should score high with large audiences and may turn out to be one of the most commercially successful films of the holiday season. The most notable element of this production is its large cast of Asian actors beginning with Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat as King Mongkut a role formerly played by the severely miscast Rex Harrison and by Yul Brynner in his Oscar-winning and most iconic performance. Foster too is well-cast giving a different interpretation to the role of the young widow and governess previously assumed by the graceful Irene Dunne and the ladylike Deborah Kerr. Its too bad that with the exception of animated movies the concept of family entertainment hardly exists anymore in America for each element of this epic-scale production from its lush visuals wide-screen format and PG-13 rating to its uncritical nature middlebrow sensibility and positioning of children at the center is designed to soothe and gratify everyone in a manner of 50s and 60s big-budget epics. Indeed watching Andy Tennants mishmash of a movie is like leafing through a catalogue of Hollywoods popular adventures of the last four decades with ideas and images borrowed from ""King Solomons Mines"" ""The Robe"" ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness"" ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" ""Doctor Zhivago"" ""Out of Africa"" and perhaps least successfully an effort to evoke the allure of the Forbidden City in ""The Last Emperor."" Framed by a brief voiceover narration from the Kings eldest son tale begins with the arrival of Anna (Foster) and her son Louis (Tom Felton) in Siam in 1862. The young British widow whose husband had died as an officer has traveled thousands of miles from India to an exotic country largely unknown to the Western world. Assisted by a Siamese primer which superficially details the regions history and customs she is bound for culture collision. Indeed as in the previous renditions the essence of the story is in the dichotomy between East and West. While impatiently waiting for the King to see her Anna wanders around the city which gives helmer and the technical crew an opportunity to engage in pageantry and record in a manner of an extravagant anthropological essay its ""bizarre"" mores and customs. Viewers are treated with sweeping vistas of crowded marketplace exteriors and interiors of the grand Palace boat rides and picnics by the river costume balls and festive banquets. Unbeknownst to Anna the Kings family consists of numerous wives and concubines and no less than 58 children whom she is meant to educate in a ""scientific"" way one that will help place Siam among countries of the modern world. As co-scripted by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes this version brings to the surface humor particularly in issues of love and sexuality as when Louis asks his mom why the King has so many wives. However explicit as these themes are they are posited from a childs point of view in a precious manner hence neutralizing their potential provocation. Annas prejudices against the King who suffers from a barbarian reputation are matched by the rulers own misconceptions about the West in general and women in particular. Upon arrival Anna is addressed as ""sir"" because women in Siam are stigmatized as inferior. Nonetheless Anna insists on getting her own house outside the Palace a promise violated by the monarch. As played by Foster Anna comes across as a more stubborn and critical woman than either Dunne or Kerr did. Predictably Anna and the King begin to share a growing affection realizing how deceptive appearances and first impressions are. Anna discovers that Mongkut is a visionary leader astute politician and humanist sadly observing his young daughter dying in his arms. For his part the King recognizes that Anna has shined a light not only on him and his offspring but also on the monarchy itself interfering when a slave runs away from her owner and demanding justice when a concubine is accused of treason. Since the validity of Annas diaries has long been contested by historians new script not only takes liberties but also calculatingly reps naive filmmaking that recalls Hollywood of yesteryear. In its dramatically weak and leisurely paced moments which are plentiful pic comes across as cute particularly in the interaction between the children and moralistic with life lessons absorbed by both Anna and the King. Hence Anna is told that she is a good teacher and a mother but an unfulfilled woman who has neglected her personal needs. It takes exactly 45 minutes for Anna and the King to exchange their first ""meaningful"" look. From then on romantic interludes are periodically inserted with at least three nocturnal occasions in which the duo dance cheek-to-cheek. Undiscriminating viewers will relish the more explicit romantic angle which in the former versions was delayed to the very end. Both the previous versions were structured around a ""mystery"" -- will Anna stay or will she leave Siam? -- a question that hardly matters in this simplistic account. Foster who here collects her biggest paycheck to date (15 million) moves gracefully in period costumes and commands the screen charismatically; her stab at a Victorian accent is respectable if not perfect. She enjoys strong chemistry with Yun-Fat who in his first non-action role in an American movie impresses with his handsome presence and dignified stillness avoiding the campy buffoonery that defined Yul Brynners performance. Tennant who last directed ""Ever After"" the Cinderella story set in sixteenth century France gives his new pic a similarly luxuriant treatment with overwhelming landscapes massive battles and parades of elephants. Caleb Deschanels widescreen lensing in Malaysia (standing in for Thailand) is eye-popping and probably a reflection of helmers conception. Luciana Arrighis lavish design Jenny Beavans sumptuous costumes and George Fentons melodic score contribute to an extremely sentimental but undeniably gratifying diversion.
