The film seems to exist solely to lampoon the modern sci-fi literature community - a very easy target. Enter Benjamin (Michael Angarano) a novice author who wants to publish a space epic Yeast Lords - but his first draft is stolen and rehashed by Dr Ronald Chevalier (Jermain Clement pictured) a terracotta leatherwear-loving sci-fi luminary. Hess likes to throw all sorts of ironic tat on to the screen and the cluttered production design obscures anything approaching an identifiable character. For every gag that works (like one on the names of sci-fi characters) rest assured something involving snake diarrhoea is close behind.

At one level it is pretty bad. Then on the other level it is downright horrible. Unless youre an entertainment masochist neither is very much fun. Gentlemen Broncos Bomb to bad Director Jared Hess. Cast Michael Angarano Jemaine Clement Jennifer Coolidge. Rating PG-13 for crude humor. Note At Harkins Valley Art. Benjamin (Michael Angarano) is a Utah teenager who writes science-fiction stories in which ghastly things happen to the heros testicles. Benjamin heads off to writers camp where his manuscript called ""Yeast Lords The Bronco Years"" falls into the hands of his idol pompous sci-fi writer Ronald Chevalier (Jemaine Clement). Chevalier has fallen on hard times so he winds up pilfering Benjamins story. Thats one level of the film and director/co-writer Jared Hess lets it play out with the kind of quirkiness that worked better in his ""Napoleon Dynamite."" The movies realism is absurdly heightened - Benjamin lives in a dome for example - and the dialogue unfolds in weirdly timed rhythms. Its very self-consciously strange and too dependent on gags about vomiting and defecation. The movie also visualizes Benjamins story and we see it through his eyes as well as Chevaliers. In those sequences a thoroughly unfunny Sam Rockwell plays the hero sporting ridiculous wigs and annoying dialects. Rockwell is just plain obnoxious like a drunk at a Sunday afternoon church social. The movie builds up goodwill at times Angarano is quite appealing and his plight is not without interest. But the film comes to a complete and deadly halt whenever Rockwell and the fantasy sequences take over. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune November 12 2009 -- 640pm Seth Smoot Associated Press - Ap In this film publicity image released by Fox Searchlight films Sam Rockwell is shown in a scene from ""Gentleman Broncos."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Once upon a time there was a weird little thrift-shop comedy called ""Napoleon Dynamite."" It came out of nowhere (well almost nowhere Utah) with a no-name cast adhered to no known comedic formula and became a smash. While it captured lightning in a bottle it had unfortunate aftereffects. It gave its giraffe-like star Jon Heder a subsequent acting career that defines the term ""sophomore slump."" And it empowered writer/director Jared Hess to keep making movies where eccentricity outweighs humor. First there was the disappointing ""Nacho Libre"" starring Jack Black as a Mexican monk who moonlights as a masked wrestler. Now theres ""Gentlemen Broncos"" a tedious and unfocused concoction involving science fiction plagiarism and the nightgown industry. Where ""Napoleons"" characters were oddly adorable ugly ducklings ""Gentlemens"" are merely awkward. Benjamin (Michael Angarano) is a solitary kid who lives in a dome house with his doting single mom (Jennifer Coolidge). Its a creative home She designs hideous fashions and he fills notebooks with lurid sci-fi novellas. At Cletus Fest ""the best writers camp in Utah"" Benjamin meets bossy Tabatha a shameless tease and his idol Dr. Ronald Chevalier (Jemaine Clement of TVs ""Flight of the Conchords"") a pretentious fantasy author on the skids. The flimsy plot revolves around Chevalier plagiarizing Benjamins manuscript ""Yeast Lords The Bronco Years"" and changing the he-man hero into a lisping sissy. The film dramatizes both writers versions with Cyclops soldiers flying battle stags and bald space babes. Sam Rockwell (""Moon"") earns a lifetime Good Sport merit badge by playing both bearlike Bronco and delicate hair-swishing Brutus. The story blows here and there like a tumbleweed with Benjamin discovering his manhood by standing up to his false idol. Angarano whose odd hangdog face has a winsome solemnity is one of the few performers to emerge unscathed. The films grotesque violence extends to firehose-caliber projectile vomit laser-firing bra cannons and a poisoned dart shot into Bens mothers chest. When shes struck you think Look on the bright side -- she may get to miss the rest of the movie.

Where do you go after rocket-propelled deer statuary cyclops warriors in golf carts and Mike White with a dubbed Irish accent?A sad-sack portrait of a home-schooled aspiring fantasy scribe (Michael Angarano) whose weekend at a writers camp turns into a twisted tale of plagiarism and movie adaptation rights Gentlemen Broncos is less about intellectual property than it is about introverts spreading their wings - or their stag antlers.Set in Utah where the sky is vast and the architecture hideous Hess movie begins with a title sequence of paperback pulp sci-fi cover art - and goes into cheesy reenactments of the prose of teen hero Benjamins latest novella Yeast Lords. Sam Rockwell in a wild wig and beard is the star of these sequences - heroically coping with hijacked reproductive organs (his own) and bringing down aerial attackers with his super-powered purple vomit spew. (Throw-up and poop are recurring motifs.)Teeming with socially awkward misfits Gentlemen Broncos is not without its absurdist charms although Hess (who co-scripted with his wife Jerusha) pushes the envelope in ways it doesnt need pushing.The real reason to see the film however is for the inspired pomposity of Jemaine Clement the Flight of the Conchords star here playing a revered author by the name of Dr. Ronald Chevalier. From the lectern and the book-signing desk his advice is priceless.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Nov. 05 2009 133PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Gentlemen Broncos Directed by Jared Hess Written by Jared Hess and Jerusha Hess Starring Michael Angarano and Jemaine Clement Classification PG Theres a lesson behind Gentlemen Broncos  the new film from director Jared Hess Dont try to mock above your talent level. Hesss attempt at parodying the world of cheesy sci-fi feels like it was made by a hack amateur director. Perhaps only really good filmmakers can parody bad filmmaking (think of Tim Burtons Ed Wood or Paul Thomas Andersons Boogie Nights ). Hesss work is more in keeping with Kevin Smiths efforts in Zack and Miri Make a Porno  Smith got the inept part right but without the distance of parody. Hesss story (co-written with his wife Jerusha) follows a moping teenaged fantasy writer Benjamin (Michael Angarano) who lives in rural Utah with his widowed mother Judith (Jennifer Coolidge) who designs garish nightgowns for a living. What made Napoleon Dynamite work was that the protagonist was so irrepressibly oblivious to his status as a social misfit He was out to win. By contrast Benjamin is whipped before he begins Its as if Napoleon Dynamite were built around the mouth-breathing Pedro. At a writers camp Benjamin meets his idol the pompous Dr. Ron Chevalier (Jemaine Clement of HBOs Flight of the Concords ). Later Benjamin learns that Chevalier has stolen his latest opus Yeast Lords The Bronco Years . Before he discovers Chevaliers plagiarism Benjamin gets involved with a group of oddballs who set out to make a movie of Yeast Lords . They include sadistic tease and producer Tabatha (Halley Feiffer) her cross-dressing filmmaker friend Lonnie (Hector Jimenez) and Dusty (Mike White) Judiths burned-out mullet-headed boyfriend who carries about an incontinent albino python. Throughout Gentlemen Broncos were exposed to different versions of the Yeast Lords movie or the plagiarized version ( Brutus and Balzaak ) both starring Sam Rockwell either as a hillbilly cracker or a simpering castrato. The films are incontestably weird - animatronic stags with rockets blasting from their rear ends pink vomit bombs and women warriors with mammary cannons - without being particularly imaginative. Gentlemen Broncos Official trailer from Fox Searchlight The geek comedy that worked in Napoleon Dynamite - the flat shooting style off-beat timing and cast of misfits - falls flat here. Hess seems to know it because he compensates by ratcheting up the crudity casting extras with malformed faces and filling the screen with enough flying vomit and poop to suggest a really bad day at the daycare. The one almost pleasant surprise is the performance of Clement as the dandyish pompous Dr. Chevalier. With his deep chocolate tones and purple vocabulary (""So many juvenescent ripe minds"") hes the one sign of intelligent life in this Hess universe.

The entire concept of the quirky-cum-heroic outsider -- which in modern times has evolved from the Brandoesque antihero into the Jon Heder-ish uber-nerd -- has finally had its metaphorical hall pass revoked.A study in dweebishness-without-redemption ""Gentlemen Broncos"" isnt a real independent film any more than the airless ""Amelia"" is an independent film. But both seem to confirm the suspicion that Hollywood simply doesnt know what its doing anymore assuming it ever did. What seems more pronounced of late is a sense that a lawyerly aesthetic has finally pushed anything human out of the way of the camera and that even a company like Fox Searchlight -- part of an evil empire sure but up till now a beacon of hope -- has surrendered to its corporate DNA.Theres a sadness to ""Gentlemen Broncos"" because it illustrates one of the golden rules of our culture-as-commerce. Namely that one must be able to repeat oneself ad nauseam even in the case of a charmingly goofball movie like Hesss ""Napoleon Dynamite"" which cannot be replicated because its singularity is its charm. But tell that to a roomful of suits who are deciding what the kids will think is groovy.Tell it to Benjamin Purvis (Michael Angarano) the home-schooled sci-fi geek who lives in a geodesic dome and whose only friend seems to be his mother (Jennifer Coolidge) who spends her time designing chaste nightgowns for a line she calls Decent Beginnings. (All the details apparently are digs at Hesss home turf of Utah and its dominant religion.) When Benjamin heads off for a weekend writers camp called Cletus Fest he meets the untrustworthy Tabatha (Halley Feiffer) and his hero the insufferable author Dr. Ronald Chevalier (Jemaine Clement). To salvage his failing career Chevalier steals Benjamins book and passes it off as his own. In an effort to be ridiculous Tabatha and the perpetually grimacing Lonnie (Hctor Jimnez) buy the rights to Benjamins novel so Lonnie can adapt it for the screen.If you havent figured it out already the only thing ""Gentlemen Broncos"" has in common with cowboys is its apres-rodeo bouquet.It has been said that you cant parody parody but Hess and his wife/co-writer Jerusha Hess apparently havent heard because they take everything one misguided step further laying on so many layers of spoof its impossible to find anything funny. Benjamins imaginings of his ""Yeast Lords"" story are enacted in cheesy sci-fi style with a game Sam Rockwell playing Bronco the studly savior of a futuristic civilization. After Lonnie gets hold of the book we have to watch his version roll out with Tabatha and Dusty -- Benjamins moms long-haired slack-jawed suitor played by Mike White -- portraying Bronco and his sidekick. Chevaliers ripoff version also features Rockwell as an effeminate spaceman in a platinum bob. One version is worse than the other; the jokes all seem to involve digestion and genitalia and between Lonnies characterization and the bewigged Rockwell there is a bit of homophobia mixed in with the space dust.On the bright side Clement (""The Flight of the Conchords"" ""Eagle vs. Shark"") is occasionally hilarious as the posturing gasbag Chevalier. And Angarano despite a profoundly ungratifying role shows that he is really a wonderful actor one with range and sensitivity. What he needs now is a new agent.Anderson is a freelance reviewer.At Landmarks Bethesda Row. Contains adult content and crude humor.

"Gentlemen Broncos Director puts the irk in quirk | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGentlemen Broncos Director puts the irk in quirkThe sci-fi themed Gentlemen Broncos doesnt just visit Planet Quirk it crash lands upon it.Jemaine Clement plays a pompus sci-fi hack in this off-beat comedy.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 6 2009(out of 4)Starring Michael Angarano Jemaine Clement Jennifer Coolidge Sam Rockwell and Mike White. Directed by Jared Hess. 90 minutes At AMC Yonge amp; Dundas. PGThe sci-fi themed Gentlemen Broncos doesnt just visit Planet Quirk it crash lands upon it.Alas the fine sense of the absurd that enlivened Jared Hess previous films Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre is in scant supply on this third mission.Article Continued BelowReturning to home base Utah after his Mexico sojourn with Nacho Libre and writing again with his Napoleon co-scribe (and wife) Jerusha Hess unwisely takes the same anything-goes approach as his morose teen protagonist Benjamin (Michael Angarano).A wannabe author with great ambition but no discernible talent Benjamin pens an elaborate space oater called Yeast Lords featuring a hero named Bronco (a very game Sam Rockwell) who loses his testicles to kinky aliens.In real life only a psychiatrist might be interested in this book. In the achingly quirky Gentlemen Broncos there are two sets of idiots fighting for it pompous and plagiarizing sci-fi hack Dr. Ronald Chevalier (Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords); and Benjamins erstwhile pals Tabatha (Halley Feiffer) and Lonnie (Nacho Libres Hector Jimenez). Chevalier slaps a new title on Yeast Lords turns Bronco into a transsexual named Brutus and flogs it as his latest cosmic emission. Tabatha and Lonnie keep the Yeast Lords title and film it as a pulpy video that may have been filmed using a Fisher-Price camera.None of this approaches hilarity and Hess sabotages a potentially potent satire on the ownership of ideas by cluttering the frame with excessive distractions and characterizations that verge on misanthropy.Hess seems deaf to his own flatulence. The script is larded with increasingly gross jokes (including one destined to be called the ""vomit kiss"") and childish references to male genitalia. Hess may be attempting to ape the penile antics of Judd Apatow whose own star in on the wane but hes well past the peak of the gross-out film fad. Angarano is lumbered with a script that keeps him virtually inert until well past the point of interest. His characters self-appointed defender Dusty played by Mike White Hess producer and Nacho co-writer has the opposite problem of being all intensity and no subtlety. Dusty brandishes an albino boa constrictor that has a vile bowel problem.Just two players survive this landing on Planet Quirk Jennifer Coolidge who plays Benjis eccentric (what else?) mom with sweet love and devotion; and Clement whose narcissistic Chevalier shows moments of genuine comic inspiration.Clement sports a telephone earpiece that he never uses. In this way hes much like Hess who is currently tuned into a frequency that few others can hear or understand.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Gentlemen Broncos Comedy. Starring Michael Angarano Sam Rockwell and Jennifer Coolidge. Directed by Jared Hess. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Setting out to make a cult movie is almost as strange as setting out to make a camp movie. Or setting out to make a movie thats so bad its good. If you know youre doing it youre not really doing it. ""Gentlemen Broncos"" from the maker of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" attempts to reach an audience who is in on the joke but this time were all in on the joke and its not much of a joke. With aching slowness - slow like you feel you can count the sprocket holes of the film as it goes through the projector - it tells the story of Benjamin (Michael Angarano) a shy teenager with unwashed hair who wants to become a science fiction writer. Thats an ambition that usually indicates one of two things A talent for science fiction or an inability to get a date. In Benjamins case it may be a little of both. In pursuit of his dream he goes to a sci-fi convention and enters a contest judged by his favorite writer an incredibly pretentious stuffed shirt with a bizarre unplaceable accent. The comic performance of Jemaine Clement as the writer is the one thing to salvage from this experience. The creation of the writer character and a few stray moments of muted comedy indicate a sensibility on the part of writer-director Jared Hess thats not immune to getting a laugh. But in ""Gentlemen Broncos"" Hess repeatedly relies on the same kinds of bits to little effect. In some cases he shows his young hero getting put upon. In other cases he shows something gross Our hero throws up and a girl kisses him getting vomit on her lips. This is as funny as it sounds. In still other cases characters are presented as utterly pathetic. For example theres our heros mom (Jennifer Coolidge) a clueless dreamer who creates hideous nightgown designs. Hess doesnt seem to know whether he wants to be sadistic toward his characters or sympathetic. He tries a little of both. Throughout Sam Rockwell appears in a series of sci-fi sequences. Some sequences represent a story as channeled through Benjamins mind. Others represent the same story as channeled through the mind of the pretentious writer. The sequences are equally excruciating whatever they represent. Dashiell Hammett once said that its a dangerous thing for a writer to realize he has a style. Hess has made three movies and hes already imitating his style rather than finding his own truth. Hes taking the wrong lesson from the success of ""Napoleon Dynamite."" But hes only 30 years old and has plenty of time to figure out what he wants to say. -- Advisory This film contains crude humor.

BY Joe Neumaier Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITICS Thursday October 29 2009 517 PM Title Michael Jacksons This Is It4 starsDocumentary-rehearsal footage of the late pop star fine-tuning a performance. At area theaters (151). PG Suggestive dances. For fans wondering whether to see this much-touted documentary-memorial-concert film reportedly only in theaters for two weeks -- take note The late King of Pop delivers.This odd hybrid of a movie -- as much a feat of editing as it is showmanship -- is made up of raw footage filmed earlier this year for what was to be Jacksons final show. Its more effective than a straight-ahead concert movie would have been. To see the 50-year-old pop star working hard in the hopes of sending shivers down a future audiences spine one last time gives closure to the festival of mourning that followed his death last June. Thanks to velvet-smooth postproduction work full performances of ""Thriller"" ""Gonna Be Startin Somethin"" ""Human Nature"" ""Ill Be There"" and ""I Just Cant Stop Loving You"" among others are successfully even movingly culled together. Weeks from death Jackson appears in complete control and often in good humor and executes old and new dance moves stunningly. If concert films by their very nature are artificial events that try to meld a you-are-there quality with a magnified sense of connection between performers and their fans ""This Is It"" benefits from the intimacy of its backstage-rehearsal atmosphere. The film makes up for its grainy look with a terrific sound. In its own quirky way it captures an artist obviously most alive while onstage. (A full review of ""Michael Jacksons This Is It"" ran  on Wednesday.) Joe NeumaierThe Boondock Saints II All Saints Day2 starsSequel about vigilante brothers. At area theaters (157). R Violence language nudity.Those who love good trash have a hero in Troy Duffy whose original ""Boondock Saints"" was just outrageous enough to earn a small but passionate cult. Both movies could be fairly derided as imitation Tarantino a complaint that wont bother fans one bit.Wry Sean Patrick Flanery and bland Norman Reedus return as the MacManus brothers Irish vigilantes determined to safeguard Bostons streets when the cops cant. The sequel adds some flavor with sidekicks Clifton Collins Jr. and Julie Benz both experts at B-movie cheese. (Mafia leader Judd Nelson emotes primarily through flared nostrils.)The only truly ugly side to this self-consciously grimy movie is the streak of Neanderthal humor. Operatic overacting is funny. Racist and homophobic jokes? Not so much.Elizabeth WeitzmanGentlement Broncos1 starComedy about competing versions of a sci-fi tale. At the Sunshine (130). PG-13 Crude humor. Is there no end to the parade of patronizing ""Napoleon Dynamite"" knockoffs? ""Broncos"" may be the worst yet -- perhaps because it was made by Jared Hess the guy responsible for this trend in the first place.Yep Hess wrote and directed ""Dynamite"" and heres proof we shouldnt have rewarded him. The hollow ""Broncos"" is even more cruelly disdainful designed primarily to scorn the pathetic lives within. The only laughs come from Jemaine Clement whos amusing as a sci-fi writer with no qualms about stealing his next story from a teenage fan (Michael Angarano). You can see Clement in the trailer now online; watch that and then rent ""Napoleon"" if youre really in the mood to laugh at losers drowning in their own quirks. Elizabeth WeitzmanLabor Day2 starsDocumentary about how the service workers union played a part in the 2008 presidential election. At the Quad (116). With Barack Obama John McCain. Unrated.Director Glenn Silbers look at how window washers public employees janitors and other working men and women played a role in 2008s political events is heartening and yet a year after being filmed unintentionally aggravating. As the various primary candidates courted the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) we watch Barack Obama John McCain and their Democratic and Republican rivals participate in the unions ""Walk a Day in Our Shoes"" program see various states groups grill candidates and hear why the people who make up this countrys backbone invested so much in that election specifically and Obama in particular. Though its viewpoint is straightforward and partisan listening to the service workers anticipate great change is a reminder that a year after that historic November a lot of distractions and obstructions are keeping many of their goals from being met. J.N.Skin3 starsA couple in apartheid-split South Africa insist their black daughter is in fact white. At the Sunshine Cinema and the Beekman (147). PG-13 Sexuality violence. This unadorned but affecting drama about Sandra Laing who attracted media attention in the 1950s when her white parents fought the South African system suffers from a one-note script but still does right by its tricky subject. As Sandra (played affectingly as an adult by Sophie Okonedo) suffers the indignities of South African apartheid in the 1960s and 70s her mother (Alice Krige) and stern father (an intense Sam Neill) insist that Sandra the middle of their three children is like them white. But her appearance classifies her as black until policy change states familial descent will dictate the barriers of South Africas government-sanctioned racism. Life forces Sandra to make her own choice splitting her from her father. Director Anthony Fabians low-key style is admirable and Okonedos beautiful careworn face is heartbreaking. A little more variation in the script though might have yielded something truly great.J.N.

BASHING ""Gentlemen Broncos"" feels like taking a bat to a bag full of kittens so Ill try to be gentle about the latest geekfest from the husband-and-wife team that gave us ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Nacho Libre."" To start with the positive Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"" is very funny -- mostly -- as Dr. Ronald Chevalier a pompous famous writer of fantasy novels whose latest effort is turned down by his publisher for being out of touch with his teenage market. A panicked Dr. Chevalier simply picks up the manuscript of ""Yeast Lords The Bronco Years"" submitted to him by high school student Benjamin Purvis (Michael Angarano) for a competition. The good doctor changes character names and the title (to ""The Chronicles of Brutus and Balzaak"") before shipping it off to the delighted publisher as his own work. Benjamin is blissfully unaware of this having sold ""Yeast Lords"" to the sexually ambiguous filmmaker/performer Lonnie (Hector Jimenez of ""Nacho Libre"") for a no-budget VHS adaptation that ramps up the already blatant homoeroticicm of Benjamins story. While ""Gentlemen Broncos"" is not without its charms -- Sam Rockwell plays Benjamins hero who loses his gonads and prances around in pink latex amid low-tech special effects -- it tests your patience even at 90 minutes. The film centers around the ultra-passive Benjamin who makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a bundle of energy by comparison. Filmmakers Jared and Jerusha Hess endless ridicule of Benjamin and his single mom (Jennifer Coolidge) -- who hand-crafts hideous rayon nightgowns and giant popcorn balls in their geodesic-dome home -- seems a lot less than affectionate. ""Gentlemen Broncos"" is fitfully amusing especially when Benjamin finally gathers up enough energy to confront Dr. Chevalier. But mostly its content to coast along on quirk. Mike White plays Benjamins beyond-weird ""guardian angel"" who fondles a white snake in one scene. Amateur psychologists will have a field day with the endless scene in which Benjamins chaste love interest (Halley Feiffer) offers him a generous squirt from a giant bottle of hand lotion. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Sting Obama best person to handle worlds mess Read Next Sting Obama best person to handle worlds mess Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 16888 How Hillary blew her big moment 9924 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 7062 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Gentlemen Broncos Too many hitches in its giddyap - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Gentlemen Broncos Too many hitches in its giddyap Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Seth Smoot Fox Searchlight Pictures Lost in space Michael Angarano left and Jemaine Clement look for the humor in Gentlemen Broncos. ABOUT THE MOVIEGentlemen Broncos  1/2 (out of four) Stars Michael AngaranoJennifer Coolidge Jemaine Clement Mike WhiteDirector Jared HessDistributor Fox SearchlightRating PG-13 for some crude humorRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY If you didnt know otherwise youd swear that Gentlemen Broncos was made by a disaffected high school student - and not a particularly talented one. VIDEO Watch the trailer But this hodgepodge of an absurdist comedy laden with bathroom humor and pathetic characters was directed and co-written by Jared Hess the filmmaker responsible for the sleeper hit Napoleon Dynamite (2004) and the sweetly funny Nacho Libre (2006). The only bright spot in this otherwise cringe-inducing comedy is Jemaine Clement one-half of the hilarious two-man novelty band in HBOs Flight of the Conchords. He plays Ronald Chevalier a pompous pompadoured twit of a fantasy writer and every scene hes in is a comic delight. But thats where the delight begins and ends. Screenwriters Jared and Jerusha Hess enjoy mocking the freakish the marginal the awkward the peculiar-looking and the woefully earnest. In Gentlemen Broncos - and also to a lesser extent in Napoleon Dynamite- characters exist solely to be objects of derision. Too bad they dont exist to be comical. But with the exception of Clements character no doubt bolstered by the actors improvisational skills Gentlemen Broncos is a humor-free experience. A motley crew of uninteresting and unsympathetic misfits parade through lacking even the eccentric appeal of the oddball cast in Napoleon Dynamite. Hess has managed something noteworthy draining the humor from Jennifer Coolidge. Despite the uneven caliber of the movies shes in Coolidge reliably generates laughs. But not here. She plays the nurturing daffy mom to teenage Benjamin (Michael Angarano) a sad-eyed home-schooled sci-fi fan. Holed up in his geodesic dome of a house Benjamin has been writing bizarre fantasy yarns for years. As the film begins he trudges off to a sci-fi fest presided over by the ridiculously self-aggrandizing Chevalier. Among the funniest bits Chevaliers smug rant about what its like to be in his brain and his inane process of devising names for his characters. But there is a surfeit of humorless ill-conceived and disgusting scenes to contend with from a vomit-speckled kiss to a dart packed with a lethal mixture of rat poison and human excrement. Talent is squandered throughout including the versatile Sam Rockwell as the buffoonish lead character in Benjamins overwrought fantasy novel. Some of the movies most leaden moments are the enactments of Benjamins story Yeast Lords The Bronco Years and its plagiarized version Brutus and Balzaak. Its meant to be ridiculous but not to flog a dead bronco its simply not funny. TVs Mystery Science Theater did a much better job of satirizing schlocky sci-fi tales. Clement deserves a better movie.

""Gentlemen Broncos"" Movie Review -- The movies are all the same. The hero is a pathetic loser at whom we are encouraged to laugh. The people surrounding him are also pathetic losers and mean too. Finally the pathetic loser beats the mean ones; hes still a jerk of course but now at least hes a winning loser. I call them Moron Movies. Gentlemen Broncos (PG-13) Fox Searchlight (89 min.) Directed by Jared Hess. With Michael Angarano Jemaine Clement Jennifer Coolidge. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING ONE AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains comic violence and mild sexual references. Will Ferrell made half a dozen pictures like this and although people eventually got tired of him the formula caught on. ""The Foot Fist Way"" was another Moron Movie. So was in a more extreme way ""Observe and Report."" So is anything with Rob Schneider. ""Gentlemen Broncos"" is the latest although its actually a kind of Mormon Moron Movie as it was made by Jared and Jerusha Hess the Salt Lake City husband-and-wife team who created the goofball comedies ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Nacho Libre."" Admittedly theres less swearing in their movies (people here say ""darn"" a lot). Nor is there any drinking or much sex (unless you count a lot of limp-wristed gay jokes). But just because their movies are ""clean"" doesnt make them innocent. Theyre still geek shows like all the others putting ""Kick Me"" signs on peoples backs and encouraging us to smirk. In this one Michael Angarano (""One of the most gifted actors of his generation"" according to the credulous production notes) is Benjamin a home-schooled teenager who writes bad sci-fi novels. Benjamin is thrilled when his idol the best-selling hack Ronald Chevalier reads one of his manuscripts. Then hes shocked when a desperate Chevalier steals the thing and publishes it as his own. Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"" plays Chevalier and is the best thing in the movie a boorish bearded homunculus full of self-love and self-deception. Hes a pompous fool and fun to hiss at. The question is who here are we not supposed to hiss at? Is it Benjamins callous girlfriend Tabitha (played by Halley Feiffer who according to the notes is ""fast becoming an indie darling known for her skill on set and kind nature off "")? Or is it Jennifer Coolidge playing a bloated caricature of her typical screen persona as Benjamins smothering mom? The rest of the characters are mere stereotypes -- heavily accented Hispanics and screaming-queen gays (or both). But then the Hesses seem to think that just saying the word ""gonads"" is funny which is presumably why they have characters say it a lot. True Clement is great as the foolish author; along with the reliably weird Mike White who shows up as a would-be actor with a blonde perm and a giant snake Clement provides the best laughs in ""Gentlemen Broncos"" apart from the publicity material. But the rest of the Hesses humor is content to simply sit back and snidely mock everyone. (The filmmakers must have been the most sophisticated wits in the BYU cafeteria. I bet they did really funny impressions of the foreign-exchange students behind their backs.) But if everything is ridiculous why should we care about anything? And if Benjamins novel is so awful (and it is) and his mothers dreams of becoming a designer are so absurd (and they are) then why should we root for either of them? After all not every book needs to be published. Not every fashion line needs to be produced. And not every movie needs to be made.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As any fashion magazine can tell you the trick to retro kitsch is moderation. And for director Jared Hess whose zeal for Goodwill grotesquerie knows no bounds the contrast between his cultishly adored Napoleon Dynamite and Gentlemen Broncos is the difference between wearing a perfectly faded concert T-shirt and draping yourself in double-knit polyester. Every frame of Hess new film--the wood-paneled walls coated with winking unicorn posters its characters high-waisted-jean-shorts-and-turtlenecks ensembles the gaunt-faced extras straight out of R. Crumb--is crammed with so much deliberate tackiness that it borders on exhausting self-parody. And much like thrift-store scavenging Gentlemen Broncos yields scant few returns to make digging through all that mysteriously stained ugliness worthwhile. Whereas Napoleon rooted for its socially retarded protagonist Broncos just pities its underdog a round-shouldered doormat (Michael Angarano) who idles away the hours in the geodesic home he shares with his widowed mother (a gamely bedraggled Jennifer Coolidge) crafting sci-fi tales about a yeast-loving redneck space warrior named Bronco. At a fantasy writers camp Angarano meets a pushily flirtatious girl (Halley Feiffer) and her best friend an amateur filmmaker (Hector Jimenez) whose mouth is frozen in a toothy rictus every bit as strained as the efforts to make his character loveable. They encourage Angarano to submit his story to a contest judged by his hero a washed-up author played by Flight Of The Conchords Jemaine Clement; in a fit of deadline-driven desperation Clement steals Angaranos story tweaking minor details and turning it into a bestseller. Meanwhile Jimenez takes his own considerable license in adapting Angaranos ravaged opus and the film volleys between scenes from the competing versions--with Sam Rockwell clearly having a ball playing ""Bronco"" (and Clements swishily effete update ""Brutus"") while zipping around on rocket-powered reindeer--as Angarano slowly works up the courage to reclaim his creation. The film hints at a Rushmore-esque showdown between Angarano and Clement that never really materializes. Instead Clement spends his too-few scenes in regrettable isolation from the rest of the cast--and while hes likeably odious as a pretentious gasbag he isnt enough to save a film that wrings its biggest laughs from diarrhea-afflicted snakes hideous sweaters and Mike White (as a burnout ""guardian angel"") in a David Coverdale wig. Most damning of all--and in stark contrast to Napoleon--Broncos doesnt have a single memorable line of dialogue. Its most lasting impression is its overbearing gaudiness and that isnt a look anyone should try pulling off.

Gentlemen Broncos. So do badly homemade garments and especially badly homemade science fiction written by Benjamin (Michael Angarano) a fantasy-obsessed home-schooled Utah teen who titles his proudest manuscript Yeast Lords The Bronco Years. Yet even as filmmakers Jared and Jerusha Hess wallow in the comedic possibilities of kitsch the husband-and-wife duo dare their audience to pass judgment on the worth of those balls those clothes and those really bad stories. As they did in Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre the Hesses claim to celebrate the amusing qualities of misshapen people and their misshapen dreams insisting that amateurism and bad taste (both in filmmaking and in life) are intentional artistic choices. The audience may have bought the act in Napoleon Dynamite. But this time the act bombs. The one saving grace of such a relentlessly unappealing movie may be that the emperors-new-clothes moment has arrived Bad taste is sometimes just a vice and amateurism in filmmaking is no virtue. In Broncos Benjamin is sent to a teen writers camp by his warmhearted but tasteless mother (Jennifer Coolidge -- ?even she looks depressed by the role). And there his manuscript winds up in the hands of competing plagiarists. A pompous formerly best-selling fantasy novelist (Flight of the Conchords Jemaine Clement) steals the plot for his own book while blithely untalented young artistes (Halley Feiffer and Nacho Libres rubbery Hector Jimenez) cannibalize Yeast Lords as a movie. Gentlemen Broncos then degenerates into an aggressively crappy dramatization of Benjamins original dorky tale with Sam Rockwell as the hero. Its hard to distinguish between the awfulness of the character and the crudeness of the performance. So why bother?

There are moments in Hesss third self-conscious cult film Gentlemen Broncos that exude a fetishistic low-fi splendor as Hess envisions the Buck Rogers-meets-Barbarella fantasy world of an introverted Utah teenager (Michael Angarano) writing a pulp science-fiction opus. But both Yeast Lords The Bronco Years and the life of its author are subject to so much projectile vomit animal flatulence and innumerable plays on the word ""anus"" that even first-graders may find their tolerance tested. ""You took my nads"" and ""Eat the corn out of my crap"" vie for their place in the catchphrase canon and an animatronic deer fires missiles out of its ass though its Flight of the Conchords Jemaine Clement who handily steals the show as a bestselling fanboy scribe sky-high on his own pomposity. Hess deserves credit I suppose for so effectively channeling his inner seven-year-old. Personally I preferred spending two hours in the company of Spike Jonzes.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Female Trouble Lars von Triers highbrow horror show. Plus The awkward joys of Gentlemen Broncos. _ By David Edelstein Published Oct 26 2009 ShareThis (Photo Christian Geisnaes/Courtesy of IFC Films) Props to Lars von Trier for managing to revive an idea that Judeo-Christian teaching the Enlightenment and feminism have helped us to suppress that misogyny is a sound religious position. In his latest cinematic mugging cheekily titled Antichrist the baleful Dane confines a man He (Willem Dafoe) and a woman She (Charlotte Gainsbourg) to a cabin deep in the woods (its called Eden). There He attempts to heal Shes psychic wounds with that most paternalistic of tools psychotherapy. Dont run away from your pain he says gently. Let it out. This goes on for some time (the film is divided into four chapters) with He laying Freudian hands on She She mocking Freud and Von Trier serving up horror-movie visions like the talking fox that announces Chaos reigns. Since the film begins with the couple having (hard-core) sex while their toddler toddles out the window (in lyrical slow-motion his stuffed animal bouncing and coming to rest beside his dead body) its tough to care about either of these self-centered people the psychobabbling prat or the bad slutty mother. Its only in the last chapterwhen She plunges a butcher knife into his crotch and He realizes what his therapeutic plumbing has loosed upon the worldthat the movies true monster (and faith) is revealed. Von Trier has said he made Antichrist after a depression and for all its artiness its revealing It should clear up any doubts about his attitude toward the fair sex. Its true that in most of his movies women are punished unjustly even martyred but its hard to shake off the feeling that he digs putting his female characters (and the actresses who play them) through the wringer. They might believe theyre innocent. They might not mean to be demonic. Its just their natureor more precisely their connection to what Camille Paglia calls chthonian Nature in all its wild primal force. (Paglia celebrates the chthonian goddess; Von Trier gravitates toward burning her.) See Also  A Squeamish Persons Guide to Seeing Antichrist  Lars von Trier Reviews His Reviews  The Ten Most Brutalized Wangs in Movie History Should you see Antichrist? Its good for a few bad laughs but you have to be up for a castration a clitoridectomy and a lot of symbolism. You have to be up for watching Dafoe and Gainsbourgthe latest in a line of masochistic stars to submit to this high priest of cinema and film-festival darlinghumiliate themselves. Von Trier has said he wanted to make a genre horror picture but he couldnt even come up with a decent metaphor The climax is out of a Grade C hack-em-up with people chasing each other through the woods with axes and knives. David Cronenberg explored a similar theme in The Brood in which a male psychiatrists est-like exhortation to a woman to go all the way through her trauma produces not inner peace but deformed psychotic babies that hammer people she doesnt like to death. Now thats entertainment There is one poignant aspect of Antichrist. He pleads with She not to blame herself for the death of their son but it turns out that it was her fault that mothers can be creatures of chill narcissistic indifference. When Von Trier appeared via a teleconferencing link at a New York Film Festival press screening (hes also travel-phobic) a questioner expressed skepticism that any mother could be so cold. You didnt know my mother the director replied. I liked him at that moment. He looked quasi-human. Unlike von Trier Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite) makes gross-out Freudian body-horror movies full of tender sympathy. The world of the flesh is icky but oh the spirit soarson even the tackiest wings. Gentlemen Broncos is the atrocious title of an enchantingly freakish comedy that centers on Benjamin (Michael Angarano) a teen who writes Dune-like sci-fi tomes (The Yeast Lords) in which he sublimates like mad to relieve his sexual discomfort. No Hess doesnt spell it out but by the third or fourth time Benjamins fictional hero (Sam Rockwell)in garish Pop Art fantasy sequencesloses his gonads and faces off against giant laser-blasting mammaries he doesnt really need to. Theres enough weird breast imagery in this movie to make Robert Crumb murmur This guys got issues. Angaranos Benjamin moves through the world on the verge of tears looking as if he wanted to will his body out of existence. Ive never seen a teen hero so stricken but then everyone in Hesss movies appears to be suffering from some unspecified gastrointestinal distress. Gentlemen Broncos is best when Hess doesnt force the grotesquerie but casually lets you observe. Theres a bit when bodice-ripper writer Tabitha (Halley Feiffer a whiz with deadpan) squirts lotion all over her hand and asks an aghast Benjamin to rub it in as her rictus-faced friend Lonnie (Hector Jimenez) leans into her ear issuing moose calls and crunching potato chips; David Lynch would murmur This guys got issues. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Napoleon Dynamite seems perfectly well-adjusted (not to mention downright charismatic) compared to homeschooled mamas boy Benjamin Purvis in ""Gentlemen Broncos"" the latest oddball character portrait from one-trick helmer Jared Hess. This time the misfit in question is an aspiring science-fiction writer easily upstaged by his idol a pompous (but published) fantasy author played by ""Flight of the Conchords"" star Jemaine Clement like the cosmic love child of Tim Curry and Orson Welles. Pic tickled its target demo at Fantastic Fest though its hard to imagine Fox Searchlight reaching enough geeks in theaters to come anywhere near ""Nacho Libres"" 80 million. Returning to Utah co-writers Jared and Jerusha Hess have concocted a fresh batch of socially awkward characters to do their comic bidding. Benjamin (Michael Angarano) inhabits a geodesic dome home with his widowed mother (Jennifer Coolidge) and desperately tries to keep his fathers memory alive by writing over-the-top stories about an intergalactic hillbilly named Bronco (whose exploits we see enacted in classic 70s B-movie style by Sam Rockwell). Benjamin has one heck of an imagination but no life experience to draw from making for strange sexually frustrated tales of yeast harvesting and gonad extraction (excrement and testicles being the pics two predominant motifs). At a writers camp for like-minded shut-ins Benjamin meets Tabatha (Halley Feiffer) and her best friend Lonnie an androgynous ""Pat""-like character played by ""Nacho Libres"" Hector Jimenez (whose unisex wardrobe and generally inappropriate conduct offer contradictory clues as to his/her actual gender). With this pairs encouragement Benjamin submits his ""Yeast Lords"" manuscript to a contest judged by his personal hero washed-up sci-fi sensation Dr. Ronald Chevalier (Clement) who changes a few names and details before submitting it as his next bestseller. Now called Brutus Rockwells character re-emerges as a tranny space cowboy in several campy cut scenes that reflect Chevaliers ""improvements"" to Benjamins original vision. Without these frequent Bronco/Brutus digressions Hess would hardly have a feature on his hands. Plot is hardly the priority in the hour or so that remains with fanciful comic digressions (including the appearance of Mike White as an ill-advised but much-needed male role model in Benjamins life) filling the time until he inevitably confronts Chevalier about the plagiarism. Not unlike ""Napoleon Dynamite"" ""Gentlemen Broncos"" serve as a study of acute social retardation. But Jon Heder brought something to that character thats missing from Angaranos performance which more closely resembles the slack-shouldered apathy of Napoleons wingman Pedro. As fate stacks up against him Benjamin merely smolders in anger -- not an easy character for an audience to root for. Chevalier may amount to little more than a caricature but hes infinitely more compelling onscreen. The novelty then is Hess eye for kitschy detail evident in everything from the sweater Benjamin wears while hawking his mothers ""country balls"" to Lonnies endearingly amateur camcorder adaptation of ""Yeast Lords."" While the effect is caustically misanthropic the helmer appears to feel genuine affection for these tacky reflections of his Midwestern upbringing (much as he does for the inbred-looking extras who populate the films supporting cast). But with no message beyond the superficial absurdity of it all Hess is in a precarious position to be critiquing the intellect or artistry of anyone else. The creative team has taken great care in replicating the hand-painted pulp book covers (showcased in a terrific opening credits montage) devoting a good chunk of the budget to making the special effects look as lo-fi as possible the retro vibe echoed in such vintage tune selections as Zager amp; Evans ""In the Year 2525."" After upgrading to a rich visual look for ""Nacho Libre"" Hess returns to the flat cinema stylings of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" d.p. Munn Powell.
