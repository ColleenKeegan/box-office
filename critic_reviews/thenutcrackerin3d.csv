Daily Edition Login to download The Nutcracker in 3D -- Film Review 605 PM PST 12/3/2010 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS This bizarre adaptation of the classic Tchaikovsky ballet is no holiday gift. TWITTER Delivering the cinematic equivalent of a lump of coal in a Christmas stocking ""The Nutcracker in 3D"" is an apparent Scrooge-like attempt by Russian filmmaker Andrei Konchalovskyto ruin forever childrenas associations with the classic Yuletide ballet. Stripping the story of any dancing and most of Tchaikovskyasmusic and filling the screen with less than jolly Holocaust imagery this misbegotten effort should be gone from theaters well before Christmas. Loosely adapted from the E.T.A. Hoffman story the film is set in early 20th century Vienna the better to feature both a cameo by Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein as one of the supporting characters. The latter as played by a hammy Nathan Lane is here seen as adorable Uncle Albert who shows up bearing the titular gift for his young niece Mary (Elle Fanning) and nephew Max (Aaron Michael Drozin). Mary neglected by her self-absorbed parents (Richard E. Grant Yulia Visotskaya) is thrilled with the wooden nutcracker (voiced by Shirley Henderson) who she promptly dubs NC. But when the toy comes to life he embroils the young girl in his life-and-death struggle to save his kingdom from the evil Rat King (John Turturro wearing a Phil Spector fright wig and horrific fangs). With the chief villain and his goose-stepping minions bearing no small resemblance to Nazis the ensuing plot developments are uncomfortable to the extreme. One can imagine the unease of parents escorting their tykes to what they imagine to be a holiday treat only to find them exposed to images- including the burning of toys into ashes- that are often arresting but seemingly straight out of ""Schindlers List."" Tchaikovskys classic score along with snippets from other compositions is somewhat present here albeit chopped up into background music and bland songs featuring nondescript lyrics by Tim Rice (who previously enjoyed far more felicitous collaborations with the likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Elton John) that are haphazardly dropped into the confusing narrative. The film which has clearly been sitting on the shelf for several years (Fanning looks much younger here than in the upcoming ""Somewhere"") has been gussied up with post conversion 3-D that only further dampens the already muddy visuals while successfully jacking up ticket prices. The 73-year-old veteran filmmaker whose career has ranged from extreme highs (""Siberiade"") to lows (""Homer and Eddie"") displays undeniable ambition with this attempt to reinvent a beloved classic. But that will be of small comfort to its younger audience members battered if not bored psyches.

Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 26 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 311PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Although its based on the same story as the popular Tchaikovsky Christmas ballet The Nutcracker in 3D is anything but a seasonal treat. This special-effects-heavy big-budget musical from expatriate Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky ( Runaway Train Tango amp; Cash) ranks as one of the most misguided childrens films ever made. Set in 1920s Vienna the story follows nine-year-old Mary (Elle Fanning whose confident performance is the films one bright spot) who is unhappy that her parents (Richard E. Grant and Yulia Visotskaya) are going out for the evening leaving her with the housekeeper and her younger brother (Aaron Michael Drozin). Before the parents depart jolly Uncle Albert (Nathan Lane) arrives with a thick-as-strudel Austrian accent and a Don King wig. Apparently hes Uncle Albert Einstein which is why hes inspired to sing Its All Relative with lyrics by Tim Rice set to the melody of Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Despite problems ranging from the mishmash of accents to the stilted performances and Fannings questionable off-the-shoulder nightgown the movie doesnt turn entirely hideous until the arrival of John Turturro as the preening Hitler-like Rat King. Adorned in an SS-style military uniform and a Phil Spector wig he leads an army of goose-stepping rat-faced soldiers on a mission to incinerate the childrens toys leaving the skies over Vienna darkened with their smoke. Director and co-writer Konchalovsky was eight years old when the Second World War ended which might help explain his urge to merge historical atrocities and fairy-tale scares but really - The Nutcracker as Holocaust allegory? That must be about as low as a high-concept film idea can get.

The Nutcracker 3D screws up the classic story in every conceivable way. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 25 2010 820 AM The Nutcracker 3D This movie screws up the classic story in every conceivable way. By Dana Stevens The Nutcracker 3D The holiday season always brings multiple iterations of the Nutcracker story the childrens tale by E.T.A. Hoffmann that became a beloved Tchaikovsky ballet. This year in New York alone theres the Balanchine version at the New York City Ballet choreographer Mark Morris dysfunctional-family take ""The Hard Nut"" and an adults-only burlesque entitled ""Nutcracker Rated R."" But it never occurred to me--nor after seeing The Nutcracker 3D (Freestyle Releasing) have I been convinced--that we needed a Nutcracker with a Nazi allegory. This non-balletic adaptation by the Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky is something gnarled and stunted and wrong something that should never have been allowed to see the light of day. Hows that for a holiday-ad pullquote? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Call to mind some of the famous melodies from Tchaikovskys Nutcracker which you know by heart even if you dont know you do the Russian dance or the Waltz of the Snowflakes. Now imagine these brief wordless bursts of musical bliss supplied with achingly banal and unmemorable lyrics by Tim Rice (Evita Jesus Christ Superstar). And then further imagine them sung by non-dancing non-singers in a green-screen void to be superimposed later over a murky CGI background converted to 3D in post-production. Even before weve gotten to the Nazis that should give you an idea of what a denatured aberration this Nutcracker became. It was created by a group of people who confoundingly assembled somewhere and agreed that all the Tchaikovsky ballet needed was less dancing and more doggerel. (If my ears heard right theres also a last-act song based on a different Tchaikovsky piece which will strike classical music listeners as the final indignity at least desecrate one of the guys works at a time) Advertisement We begin in what appears to be between-two-wars Vienna (recreated on a Hungarian soundlot where tax breaks made it cheaper for Konchalovsky to shoot). Its Christmas Eve. As in the original the young heroine here named Mary (Elle Fanning) gets a wooden nutcracker doll as a gift from a magical relative--in this version a kindly uncle played by Nathan Lane with giant Einstein hair and an even more outsized Austrian accent. (""Vot do you sink of zis Mary?"") That night after everyone is asleep the doll comes alive and tells Mary his story hes really a prince (Charlie Rowe) whos been put under a spell by the evil Rat King (John Turturro) a rodent dictator whos taken over the princes peaceful homeland and filled it with belching smokestacks and gloomy Third Reich architecture. I suppose I shouldnt push the Nazi/rat analogy too far for fear of bringing down Godwins Law upon my head. But Im not the one who outfitted the rat army in Prussian-style spiked helmets and vaguely fascist uniforms or gave them lines alluding to ""an empire that will last a thousand years."" The scenes in the underground headquarters of the Rat King are ill-conceived to a staggering degree scary and confusing for small children grindingly tedious for adults. Heartbreakingly the ballets second act in the Land of Sweets--the fantasyland where the heroine and her prince admire dances by personified goodies from all over the world--has been eliminated entirely theres no Sugar Plum Fairy no Arabian coffee dance no Mother Ginger with a row of children stashed under her voluminous skirt. After all why would kids want to visit a brightly colored world of dancing candies when they could be battling Nazi rodents in a CGI steampunk helicopter? This version also saddles poor Mary with neglectful parents (Richard E. Grant and Yulia Visotskaya) who casually dash out on her and her brother (Aaron Michael Drozin) on Christmas Eve creating an abandonment-issues subplot thats resolved in a hasty unconvincing coda. This is especially sad given that both Richard E. Grant (Withnail) and Elle Fanning bring all theyve got to their underwritten roles. Fanning Dakotas 12-year-old sister is a wonderfully fresh uncloying young actress and my longtime pick for Best Fanning. Elles not to blame for this movies spectacular failure; she remains a bright spark amid the squalor. The Nutcracker 3D was scheduled for release last Christmas but held back for another year of tinkering after pre-screening audiences wisely recoiled. But whatever was done to the film in the interim wasnt enough to overcome the projects foundational incoherence. Its an awful thing to say about a childrens classic at Christmastime but this Nutcracker should have been strangled in its crib. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

By David Edelstein Published Nov 28 2010 ShareThis Natalie Portman on the set of Black Swan.  (Photo Ray Lewis) In The Wrestler Darren Aronofsky crafted a battering ode to male masochism to the notion that one is truly ecstatically alive on the brink of self-obliteration. And now for the perfect insanity-inducing double bill comes that films female counterpart Black Swan. The protagonist is Nina a New York ballerina played (and largely danced) by Natalie Portman. She is still in essence a girl sexually immature living with an infantilizing mother (Barbara Hershey) surrounded in her pink bedroom by stuffed animals. Shes also a serial puker who scratches herself until she bleeds a spirit in limbo. Nina is a candidate to play the Swan Queen in Tchaikovskys Swan Lake but her companys artistic director (Vincent Cassel) maintains shes suited only for half the double role. She is the very embodiment of the innocent White Swan who kills herself for love. But for the dark demonic twin Nina is sadly lacking in life experience. Like a Method-acting guru he lectures her on letting go losing herself surrendering completely to her sexuality. Watch the Video A Drunken Winona Ryder Accosts Natalie Portman in Our Exclusive Clip Black Swan dramatizes that surrender and its overpowering side effects and it plays like a Roman Polanski remake of Showgirlswith dollops of other Gothic/Grand Guignol filmmakers David Lynch (lifes a dream) David Cronenberg (lifes a dream that makes icky things sprout from your flesh) Brian De Palma (lifes a voyeuristic tracking shot) and even that Italian giallo maestro Dario Argento (lifes a dark mirror that will shatter and slash you). The camera follows about a foot behind Ninas slender neck as the settings change and doppelgangers pop up left and right. The movies epitaph could be Double double toil and trouble. Although Nina tells the director that her goal is perfection she doesnt really mean artistic perfection. In The Company Robert Altman moved back and forth between physical (and emotional) punishment and sublime ballets but Aronofsky isnt remotely interested in celebrating the Dance. Black Swan is full of scary-looking emaciated women their dark hair severely pulled back twisting and cracking their limbs and toespuppets of a tyrannical male deity. Even before Nina begins to unravel the dances are shot by a camera that seems to be shuddering in horror. Aronofsky has one overriding aim to get past the blood-brain barrier and give you a drug experience. In his first feature Pi an obsession with a mathematical equation caused a stroke while pills and smack dictated the fractured syntax of Requiem for a Dream. In The Fountain he even made love a lethal intoxicant. Aronofsky is enough of a virtuoso to bring that aesthetic off but its a painfully constricted vision and like most drug experiences it leaves little behind but a hangover. At their worst his films suggest that theres a thin line between the hypnotic and the stupefying. Portman gives the kind of performance that wins awards largely because youre so aware of her sacrifices to play the part. She looks as if she trained hard and for an actress she dances wellalthough not brilliantly or distinctively enough to convince you that the company director would single her out. Toward the end of Black Swan her face is all bone and hollows like a shrunken head; it comes as a relief to gaze (too briefly) on the full rounded features of Mila Kunis as Ninas insinuating fake-solicitous rival. Meanwhile Hersheys tight face emblemizes another more Hollywood brand of female insecurity and masochism. Aronofsky cast Winona Ryder as the aging prima ballerina whom Nina replaces and I couldnt help but think he was exploiting her reputation as an increasingly unstable ingenue who crashed and burned. The movie is full of casualtiesthey could all win awards. Black Swan is crushingly obvious from its first frame to its exultant final whiteout with poor Cassel having to utter variations of the same exhortation in every scene. (When he directs Nina to go home and touch herself Aronofsky makes sure we see the giant stuffed bunny near her bed.) But this is no doubt about it a tour de force a work that fully lives up to its directors ambitions. It takes a long time to purge Tchaikovsky from your head You exit pursued by a swan. Theres not enough Tchaikovsky in Andrei Konchalovskiys The Nutcracker in 3D which has so many terrible ideas that the terrible execution is almost irrelevant Even if the film were well done it would still be a travesty. Start with the notion of reducing the amount of dance to about 45 seconds axing most of the score and writing lyrics for whats left which is mostly iterations of Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy. Go on Try singing somethinganythingto Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy and see how awkwardly it sits (or stumbles) on the tongue. The lyricist Tim Rice squeezes two songs out of that overfamiliar piece the first Its All Relative sung by a miserable-looking Nathan Lane as the childrens mysterious uncle. Said uncle is now for no reason I can discern Albert Einstein. Nothing like trimming the Christmas tree with your Jewish relatives. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Credit Freestyle Releasing There are a few things that ""Nutcracker"" fans need to know about the new holiday extravaganza ""The Nutcracker in 3D"" which according to the production notes was ""inspired by the beloved ballet."" First theres no ballet though there is a rudimentary waltz on ice skates.Second Tchaikovskys ""Nutcracker"" music is chopped up and used as background here and there in Edward Artemievs score. Sometimes it receives the further indignity of being turned into songs with lyrics by Tim Rice the master of high-class doggerel (""Evita"" ""Aida""). Uncle Albert (Nathan Lane channeling Einstein in a fright wig and a frightening Viennese accent) sings a ditty called ""Its All Relative"" to the tune of ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" ""Whos to say what/Is or is not?/Who writes your plot?/You""Last but not least elements of the ballet and the E.A. Hoffmann story on which its based have been subsumed into a new story set in a candy-cane early-20th-century Vienna which begins with a young brother and sister a big Christmas tree and a magical nutcracker before veering into a full-blown Nazi allegory with goose-stepping rats in steel helmets. Things become even more oddly unfestive when we see shuffling lines of people forced to throw their childrens toys into huge piles on the street an image clearly meant to evoke the Holocaust.""The Nutcracker in 3D"" is the latest curiosity in the career of the 73-year-old Russian-born director Andrei Konchalovsky (""Runaway Train"" ""Shy People"" ""Tango amp; Cash"") who also wrote the screenplay with Chris Solimine. Its a dystopian fantasy masquerading as a childrens story with weird things popping up like a bit of kung fu wire work by the Rat King (a hammy John Turturro) or a scene involving an electrocuted shark that appears to be a homage to or a dig at Damien Hirst. Theres a surprising level of bloodless violence and a propensity to uncover a bit more of the body of its 12-year-old star Elle Fanning than is strictly called for. Advertisement Continue reading the main story On the brighter side the talented Ms. Fanning gives a capable performance and Mr. Konchalovsky and his camera and special-effects crews put a few arresting images on screen including some frightening metal rat-dogs. But even there they fall short of obvious models like Jean-Pierre Jeunets ""City of Lost Children"" and the 3-D treatment adds nothing. (The Viennese scenes shot on Budapest soundstages give a new dreary meaning to ""workmanlike."") Bits and pieces of ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" films are thrown into the pot in an attempt to achieve some fairy-tale flavor but you may find yourself responding most strongly to the occasional recognizable fragment of Tchaikovsky on the soundtrack.""The Nutcracker in 3D"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). No blood but quite a bit of suspense and violence including an electrocuted shark and a decapitation.THE NUTCRACKER IN 3D Opens on Wednesday nationwide.

Tchaikovskys glorious music is the only thing that survives in Andrei Konchalovskys spectacularly misconceived bloated and incredibly ugly fantasy epic ""The Nutcracker in 3-D."" For his first major film since ""Tango and Cash"" more than two decades ago the Russian director of ""Runaway Train"" offers a CGI-loaded filmed-in-Hungary goulash thats part Holocaust allegory part ""Alice in Wonderland"" part ""The Wizard of Oz"" -- and entirely stupid. E.T.A. Hoffmanns classic story may have survived a ballet film with Macaulay Culkin but here its up against poorly executed Michael Bay-style pyrotechnics on hideous massive sets that look like theyre left over from ""The Golden Compass."" Tchaikovskys music is paired with inane lyrics by Tim Rice that defeat even a trouper like Nathan Lane who in this version is playing a benevolent Uncle Albert whose last name is apparently Einstein in 1920s Vienna. The less vocally gifted (to put it kindly) Elle Fanning plays his niece Mary (nee Clara) who dreams that a nutcracker her uncle gives her is really a prince (the appropriately wooden Charlie Rowe) cursed by the Rat Queen (Frances de la Tour who doubles ""Oz""-style as Marys nanny). Through the efforts of the Sugar Plum Fairy (Yuliya Vysotskaya the directors wife also cast as Marys mother) they all end up in the princes former kingdom. There the Hitler-like Rat King (John Turturro who also makes dubious vocal contributions) burns toys in what look alarmingly like concentration-camp crematoria. None of this frantic random cultural rummaging -- at one point Marys father actually says ""remember what Dr. Freud said about child psychology"" -- is remotely entertaining much less charming. As for the other supposed selling point of ""The Nutcracker in 3-D"" -- if you dont get a headache from the script and the explosions the blurry stereoscopic cinematography will certainly do the trick.

Hoberman The Nutcracker in 3D Nathan Lane and Nazi Rats Wednesday November 24 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Announced at Cannes in 2007 and scheduled to shoot that summer Andrei Konchalovskys version of The Nutcracker arrives several Thanksgivings past its due date--CGI-enhanced 3-D-retrofitted and bizarrely high-concept. As co-scripted by Konchalovsky The Nutcracker 3D is closer to the E.T.A. Hoffmann story ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" than to Tchaikovskys snowflake-dusted Sugarplum Fairy fest; nominally set in 1920s Vienna its less a dance-film than an operetta with Tim Rices lyrics put to Tchaikovskys music. Nathan Lane wearing a gray fright wig and mimicking Walter Slezaks Sachertorte accent is the kindly godfather; the little heroine is Elle Fanning noticeably more childish here than she will appear next month in Sofia Coppolas Somewhere but nonetheless rivaling big sister Dakotas knack for the sudden shrill scream. John Turturro plays the villainous Rat King in make-up that makes him look alarmingly like Phil Spector. Sigmund Freud is repeatedly name-checked but the influence of another onetime Vienna resident is far more evident The evil rodents who take over the city in a bit of 9/11-evoking terror are nothing less than Ratzis--they even operate an extermination camp for childrens toys complete with crematoria. Konchalovsky not only anticipated Toy Story 3s dump truck to hell sequence he exceeded it. In one fantastic bit of business Turturro (or his avatar) dances an exultant flamenco amid toys heaped in the street like bundles of confiscated clothing. The wildest thing about this movie is its faith that what kids (and parents) really want for Christmas is a Nutcracker version of the Final Solution.

In this film publicity image released by Noisette Film Productions Elle Fanning is shown in a scene from ""The Nutcracker in 3D."" Photo AP The Nutcracker in 3D review Like a bad trip 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Nutcracker in 3D Fantasy adventure. Starring Elle Fanning Nathan Lane and John Turturro. Directed by Andrei Konchalovsky. (PG. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Nutcracker in 3D"" will be barely recognizable to fans of the beloved holiday classic. Imagine watching Tchaikovskys ballet after taking a handful of peyote - on a day when all of the dancers call in sick and the orchestra decides to play a different set of the composers works. You can blame or credit Andrei Konchalovsky depending on your feelings about a ""Nutcracker"" with new characters name changes a mechanical helicopter with robot legs a rat king that rides a motorcycle with machine guns mounted on it and some too-obvious Holocaust references. Very young children might be too terrified to sit through the film. Terry Gilliam fans may think the whole thing is brilliant. This ""Nutcracker"" is two years delayed which is rarely a good sign. Elle Fanning (sister of Dakota) is Mary the mostly ignored daughter of a performing mother (Yuliya Vysotskaya) and an uptight aristocratic father (Richard E. Grant). Stoked by the imagination of her Uncle Albert (Nathan Lane) she wakes from a dream to befriend an animated nutcracker boy named ""NC."" From there its a battle between good and evil with dolls that come to life toy-eating furnaces parallel realities and John Turturro as the Rat King - wearing a Phil Spector wig and rodent teeth that sometimes morph nightmarishly into an ""American Werewolf in London"" special effect. The movie can also be quite stunning. Marys trip up the expanded Christmas tree is filmed with incredible scope and beauty. Fanning is mostly perfect in the movie showing a sense of wonder without the precociousness that sometimes marred her older sisters early performances. The first act of ""The Nutcracker in 3D"" is the best part filled with details and slightly surreal surprises that are often delightful. The first appearance of the Rat King marks a shift in the movie and along with the bleakness comes a visual muddiness. The action scenes - many of which take place in sewer tunnels - are unremarkable and repetitious. ""The Nutcracker in 3D"" is a family-unfriendly 110 minutes from beginning to end and feels a half hour longer. Its easy to understand why a studio might be nervous to promote Konchalovskys film. But with all of its abstract strangeness its also possible to imagine a strong following 30 years from now. Audiences didnt know what to think about the unsettling weirdness of Jim Hensons ""The Dark Crystal"" or Walter Murchs ""Return to Oz"" either when they came out in the 1980s. As for the 3-D this is one more example of studios sabotaging the future of the medium with a second-rate effort. Its mostly unimpressive looking as if it was added late in the production. Not as bad as the ""Clash of the Titans"" 3-D treatment but definitely not worth the added expense. -- Advisory This film contains scary images and dark themes.

"Movie review The Nutcracker in 3D - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review The Nutcracker in 3DThe 3-D was added post-production. Tim Rices prefab-seeming lyrics dont add anything. But the biggest problem The result is gassy when its not outright nightmarish.November 24 2010|By Gary Goldstein Special to the Los Angeles Times Your Thanksgiving turkey has arrived on schedule and its called ""The Nutcracker in 3D."" Director Andrei Konchalovskys gassy spectacle inspired by Tchaikovskys classic ballet score and its fairy tale source material (E.T.A. Hoffmanns short story) comes off like a wan mash-up of ""The Wizard of Oz"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""Toy Story"" and frankly ""Willard"" but with a manufactured sense of wonder and tension. Worse trying to hip up this retro-tinged package with post-produced 3-D proves pointless and merely undermines the films otherwise OK special effects. Konchalovsky and Chris Solimines script set in 1920s Vienna revolves around Mary ( Elle Fanning curiously unengaging) a precocious well-off child drawn into a chaotic fantasy world by a new Christmas toy a wooden nutcracker doll (voiced by Shirley Henderson) given to her by her jovial uncle ( Nathan Lane in forced Teutonic accent and Einstein fright wig). But turns out this doll is actually a child prince (Charlie Rowe) who needs Marys help to save his kingdom from the grotesquely evil Rat King ( John Turturro in a staggeringly ill-conceived turn) and his nasty Rat Queen mother (Frances de la Tour). Younger kids will likely find the pervasive rat business either nightmarish or a turn-off while parents might wish theyd just stayed home and played Tchaikovskys gorgeous music for their children without the burden of the prefab Tim Rice song lyrics tacked on here. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESIndias night rat killers Hunting shadows that scurrySeptember 5 2011Andrei Konchalovsky builds a strange maze with The...November 26 2010A Wacky Computer-Animated NutcrackerDecember 23 1999MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentNutcrackerCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-nutcracker-20101124,0,6722776.story",200,thenutcrackerin3d9,thenutcrackerin3d,latimes

Share Tweet The catastrophically clumsy Hungarian/British co-production The Nutcracker In 3D isnt the first project to add lyrics to Tchaikovskys Nutcracker ballet or to assume that the presence of dancing fairies snowflakes and toys requires the most cloying cutesy interpretation possible. But Nutcracker In 3D doesnt just compound past errors in re-imagining the story. Thanks to a big budget huge staging massive overacting and the non-wonders of post-production 3-D conversion it adds a wide bevy of new errors. At best its a dully lavish overblown fantasy a companion piece to The Golden Compass in finding ways to overstretch thrilling material and turn it into a random mishmash of limping setpieces. At worst its a joke an exercise in treacly bad taste a 90 million pain in the retinas. The problems start with the titular 3-D which rivals The Last Airbender for muddiness when the camera is moving and distracting planar confusion at all other times. Characters in partial profile appear to have one eye on an entirely different visual plane from another; its often hard to tell where objects are relative to each other or where they are at all during the frequent pans. But even in 2-D the film would have such distractions as Nathan Lane breaking the fourth wall to absolutely no purpose (playing a dotty Einstein-like uncle who occasionally offers meaningless comments to the audience) and horrifically stiff similarly purposeless songs sung/chanted to some of the Nutcrackers most memorable tunes. Elle Fanning is suitably charming as a girl drawn into a vividly designed fantasyland of fairies and talking toys where a boy prince (Charlie Rowe) attempts to escape the curse that transformed him into a wooden nutcracker. His adversary is an evil rat king played by John Turturro whos sometimes a hoot to watch when in his hammiest mode. But here he looks like Andy Warhol trying to play Cabarets emcee and the embarrassing songs do him no favors either. Theres often some enjoyment in watching stars gamely take on ridiculous material but Nutcracker In 3Ds random assemblage of underdeveloped characters half-baked-then-abandoned subplots and empty character vamping induces more yawns than gapes. Add on a needless creepy series of references to Freud and to the Third Reich--Turturros Nazi-uniformed heavies round up their ragged subjects and force their toys into giant smoke-belching furnaces in the most twee retelling of the Holocaust imaginable--and the entire thing joins the ranks of Dune and Super Mario Bros. in the annals of films so obsessed with visual design that the ridiculousness of all other aspects of production somehow went unnoticed.

The Nutcracker turns into a prince whose handle is NC. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Nutcracker in 3D 1/2 out of four Stars Elle Fanning Nathan LaneJohn Turturro Frances de la TourDirector Andrei KonchalovskyDistributor Freestyle ReleasingRating PG for thematic material scary images action and brief smokingRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Who had the lamebrained idea for a post-apocalyptic 3-D Nutcracker that is lacking any trace of ballet? Reimagining the Christmas classic with broken burnt toys tricked-out motorcycles fiendish rats bent on world domination Nazi overtones and banal lyrics sung to Tchaikovskys score was an inane notion. Whatever happened to sugar plums? Its not that the holiday ballet is sacrosanct. The simple Nutcracker tale could use some creative amplification. But this particular reinvention is embarrassingly bad contrived convoluted amateurish and tedious. The 3-D is hardly worth bothering with and the acting is either ridiculously over the top or unspeakably wooden. The dialogue is worse. Nathan Lane as Uncle Albert (Einstein) -- its set in Vienna after all -- performs the forgettable song Its All Relative to the signature tune of The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Inexplicably he sports a tall gray wig that recalls Don Kings iconic coif. As the Rat King John Turturro comes closest to having fun (he wants to ""rat-ify"" the world) as does Frances de la Tour who plays the Rat Kings overbearing mother at one point channeling Liza Minnellis Sally Bowles in Cabaret. But their enthusiasm is not enough to save this debacle. Its astounding that Oscar-winning lyricist Tim Rice responsible for the songs in Aladdin The Lion King and Jesus Christ Superstar came up with these bland pseudo-uplifting songs. Nine-year-old Mary (Elle Fanning) receives a gift from her Uncle Albert a wooden Nutcracker that looks startlingly like Pinocchio. He turns into a boy prince (Charlie Rowe) but the story obscures any human element by crowding it with special effects frenetic chases and explosions. There is one visually arresting scene in which Mary and the Nutcracker magically travel up her familys bedecked Christmas tree amid falling snowflakes. Non sequiturs pad the script. Marys mother (Yuliya Visotskaya) tells her ""I have to go to the little girls room."" Isnt this TMI for a family-oriented holiday tale? The sense of period is an anachronistic mash-up. Visuals range from turn of the century to 1920s to World War II era. Contemporary cliches abound as in Uncle Alberts admonition to his nephew ""I would tell you but then Id have to kill you."" And Nutcrackers handle is NC. Characters accents are a jumble Lanes is German Marys fathers (Richard E. Grant) is British and the children are American. Mostly the story suffers from holiday-inspired ADD and insipid cheerleading. Theres a lot of prattling about believing anything is possible. A more fitting title might have been ""Rats v. Toys."" Guess who wins? As far as rodents go the vermin are far more engaging in Ratatouille. Toys coming to life and striking up friendships with children is hardly new. Toy Story enlivened a whole toy chest with infinitely more amusement and originality. Audiences would be better off watching any of the three Toy Story movies or attending a live performance of The Nutcracker. Time or money spent on this charmless mishmash will be sorely wasted.

Seemingly predicated on the idea that nothing says ""the holidays"" quite like the Holocaust ""The Nutcracker in 3D"" owes as much to Art Spiegelmans ""Maus"" as it does to Tchaikovsky. Like the traditional ballet Andrei Konchalovskys musical extravaganza has its share of tinsel and snowflakes and draws from E.T.A. Hoffmans ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" -- except here the mice are Nazified rats herding the people of old Vienna into labor camps. Audience bewilderment could turn to anger given the dire contrast between the storys seasonal associations and what Konchalovsky has fashioned from it which is assuredly not ""Merry Christmas."" Music fans will have their own complaints Tchaikovskys score which ranks among the most beloved in the classical repertoire has been modified into very conventional songs by Disney house lyricist Tim Rice and Konchalovsky collaborator Edward Artemiev. (They dont stop at ""The Nutcracker"" either When the Prince played by Charlie Rowe sings ""Life Begins Again"" auds will hear a melodic line snatched from Tchaikovskys Piano Concerto No. 1.) The familiarity of the music may actually be a disadvantage; the ear wants the melodies to conform to ones memory of them but instead theyve been tortured into compliance with the needs of a standard movie musical. Its Christmas in 1920s Vienna   -- someone early on acknowledges Sigmund Freud gliding by on ice skates -- and Mary (Elle Fanning) is bright-eyed and expectant. Unhappy that her parents (Richard E. Grant Yulia Visotskaya) are going out for the evening shes nevertheless thrilled that she and brother Max (Aaron Michael Drozin) will be babysat by their Uncle Albert -- Einstein naturally (Konchalovksy having suspended the time-space continuum). As played by Nathan Lane Albert is a schnitzel-accented Santa Claus who brings gifts for Max and Mary including what will become Marys most cherished possession -- a mechanical wooden nutcracker (with the voice of Shirley Henderson). So far so good until it soon becomes evident the Nutcracker is involved in a battle for world domination against the Rat King (John Turturro wearing a platinum wig he might have borrowed from Phil Spector) who is enslaving the population with his Rat Queen mother (Frances de la Tour). Turturros performance is too over-the-top to be taken seriously although there are some transformation scenes in which his teeth take on nightmarish proportions that could frighten tykes. Add to this the slave-labor elements and ""Metropolis""-inspired imagery and its all a lot less First Noel than Third Reich. In Spiegelmans graphic novel the Nazis were cats the Jews were mice and the rats were ... rats. Even still the films anthropomorphic aspects seem strongly reminiscent of those in ""Maus"" which like the original ""Nutcracker"" was a fairy tale with a tragic foundation. But ""The Nutcracker in 3D"" is too much of a burlesque to create many resounding moral echoes. Konchalovsky the veteran Russian helmer whose films have ranged from ""Runaway Train"" to ""Tango and Cash"" (he also co-wrote ""Andrei Rublev"" with Andrei Tarkovsky) has been at this project for several years and its clear enough that the film has been on the shelf for a while Fanning who makes the proceedings far more bearable than they should be is obviously years younger than the actress who appears in the current ""Somewhere."" The 3D isnt much of a visual asset here but it might have served as a commercial kickstart for a project that was unmistakably a labor of love of the sort the French would call lamour fou. Tech credits are mixed The production design is first-rate but not surprisingly the music is inferior to the original.
