Comments (28) click to enlarge X-Men Days of Future Past Video Rated PG-13  131 minutes  2014 Dont let the title scare you there are no Moody Blues songs in the latest X-Men romp the seventh in the franchise. There are however plenty of fine actors buried under the usual avalanche of digital effects Michael Fassbender James McAvoy Jennifer Lawrence Hugh Jackman and new to the series Peter Dinklage as an evil scientist who wants to kill all the superhuman mutants in the world. Much of this takes place in the early 1970s which gives the filmmakers an excuse to haul out lots of vintage kitsch and make some rather tasteless references to the Vietnam war. Bryan Singer who directed the first two X-Men movies is back behind the camera though this looks virtually identical to the previous installment X-Men First Class directed by someone else.

"X-Men Days of Future Past - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire X-Men Days of Future Past Posted by Christy Lemire on May 28 2014 5 Comments 20th Century Fox Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action some suggestive material nudity and language. Running time 131 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. The ""X-Men"" movies are for the most part a giant blur for me.  I know Ive seen them all -- theres got to be a good solid half-dozen of them at this point right? -- and probably even enjoyed myself from time to time. Last years ""The Wolverine"" which essentially functioned as a stand-alone film outside the ""X-Men"" universe was both thrilling and emotionally weighty. But not being a comic-book aficionado these movie adaptations dont really matter to me. They provide no nostalgic allure. They are to borrow one of my kids favorite phrases not my favorite. And truly such massive superhero fatigue has set in by now between all the various Batman and Superman and Avengers movies that the prospect of spending two-plus hours with these mutants inspired a shrug and a bit of dread. All of which is why ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" is such a wonderful surprise. Actually its more than that Its a kick in the ass. Director Bryan Singer returns to the series he launched with 2000s ""X-Men"" and 2003s ""X2 X-Men United"" with a sure hand on both the relationships between his characters and the enormous set pieces youd expect from a summer blockbuster. The results are both dazzling and intimate clever and -- during one tour-de-force sequence -- spectacularly funny. Yes there are too many X-Men. There are always too many X-Men. And things get especially crowded here because ""Days of Future Past"" (which I keep wanting to call ""In Through the Out Door"") features the characters from the original ""X-Men"" trilogy as well as their younger selves from 2011s ""First Class."" Plus theres a bunch of other random mutants who get a moment to show off whatever cool thing it is they can do for a second or two during a massive battle. A superstar like Halle Berry for example is a mere blip in her nearly dialogue-free performance as Storm. But the cast is so strong and so present the actors bring great meaning to their interactions with each other. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender have such a lively and fraught brotherhood as former close friends Professor Charles Xavier/Professor X and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto that it lends a touching poignancy to the later exchanges between the elder statesmen in those roles Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. ""Days of Future Past"" is a time-travel movie but its a time-travel movie that actually works. The logic and logistics snap into place and make sense and at times theyre even mind-blowing. In great and challenging ways the film is reminiscent of Christopher Nolans ""Inception"" how it moves through layers of time and the communication that takes place between those layers with Ellen Page serving as both conduit and guide. (Theres also the destruction of a football stadium during a major set piece which calls to mind Nolans ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg were feeling truly ambitious here and it pays off.) But it begins as so many action extravaganzas do these days in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future. Major world cities have become bleak war zones overrun by giant flying robots called Sentinels created to seek out and destroy all mutants. (One of the first images Singer shows us is of corpses being dumped off the back of a truck in case youre considering bringing young kids to the theatre). Professor X and Magneto team up to send Hugh Jackmans Wolverine back in time -- or at least send his consciousness back in time through the telepathic powers of Pages Kitty Pryde -- to change history in 1973. Wolverine was chosen because his self-healing ability makes him the only one who could withstand such a journey. Plus he looks particularly groovy in the fashion of the time. The costume and production design are beautifully evocative of the period without veering into full-on parody. Jennifer Lawrence as the shape-shifting Raven/Mystique may even have brought a few of her sexy get-ups from the ""American Hustle"" set. (Lawrence whos such a juggernaut these days doesnt get to do much beyond slink about and kick butt in that unforgiving blue body paint but shes a formidable sight to behold nonetheless.) Speaking of Mystique stopping her from doing something drastic is the whole reason Wolverine goes back in time. But hell need help from the younger versions of Charles and Erik who are estranged at this point and will require some coaxing as their elder versions acknowledge ruefully. This includes breaking Erik out of a prison deep below the Pentagon (the reason hes there is very amusing) which sets up the most imaginative thrilling sequence of the entire film. I wont spoil it for you -- Ill just say it involves the mutant Quicksilver (a scene-stealing Evan Peters) and the beautifully staged and edited manipulation of time. If nothing else see ""Days of Future Past"" for this segment alone. Peter Dinklage also stands out -- as he always does with his resonant voice and inspired choices -- as the scientist whose development of the Sentinel program has the potential to eradicate mutants once and for all. (We could have used more of Dinklage actually. He has such a compelling screen presence.) What this means to us as viewers -- metaphorically historically - is crystal clear without being didactic or heavy-handed. Like everything that preceded it in the  ""X-Men"" series ""Days of Future Past"" is about the marginalized and the disenfranchised and the sense of unity that binds and strengthens them. But being an effects-laden summer blockbuster it also has to unify the various people who like to eat popcorn in the dark. It morphs between both of these modes seamlessly.

There wasnt any particular scene that I didnt like or lose interest in like the other X-Men and their spin off movies. Also that Quicksilver scene is indeed awesome. Im looking forward to X-Men Apocalypse. Bring it on Reply June 27 2014  by  Aaron     Very well written review. Nailed it Reply July 17 2014  by  Jake S.     Good Film but again highly overrated.

But it is a testament to the remarkable tenacity of the superhero genre--a genre that has more than once seemed utterly spent--that Im referring not to an Altman but to an X-Men.Related Story The Gay Rights Parable of X-Men Now its true that X-Men Days of Future Past has achieved this milestone in part through arithmetic sleight of hand by essentially combining the cast of the first three X-Men films (Hugh Jackman Halle Barry Ian McKellen Anna Paquin--here present only in minute cameo--Patrick Stewart Ellen Page etc.) with that of its subsequent pre-boot X-Men First Class (Jennifer Lawrence Michael Fassbender James McAvoy Nicholas Hoult...) Still it is an impressive accumulation of talent one reinforced by the return of director Bryan Singer who masterfully helmed the first two installments of the franchise.As he demonstrated in those earlier films Singer has a particular aptitude for taking narratives that teeter on the precipice of preposterousness and imbuing them with unexpected moral resonance and gravity. Its a skill set in notable demand over the course of this exceptionally ambitious new chapter which interweaves not only casts but storylines time periods and dramatic moods.Singer opens in the dystopian near-future with a shot of a post-apocalyptic Manhattan presided over by an Empire State Building with a hole punched through its upper floors. Intelligent robots called the Sentinels have conducted a decade-long war to eradicate mutants a war that they have unilaterally expanded to include human beings suspected of helping mutants as well as those who might produce mutant offspring down the road. In practice this seems to mean ""pretty much all humankind."" (Yes the echoes of Skynet rumble loudly.)A few familiar franchisees (Professor X Magneto Wolverine Storm) and assorted minor mutants (Bishop Blink Sunspot) take sanctuary in a remote Himalayan monastery where they adopt a plan to save the future by altering the past. Kitty Pryde (Page) will project the consciousness of Wolverine (Jackman) back to his semi-ageless 1973 self. There he will enlist the aid of the younger versions of Professor X (McAvoy) and Magneto (Fassbender) in an effort to prevent Mystique (Lawrence) from killing the Sentinels inventor Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage)--a murder that precipitated the all-out war against mutants that has wrought such global havoc.Still with me? From this conceit the movie proceeds in relatively straightforward fashion with a slumbering future Wolverine (shades of The Matrix) trying to accomplish his mission in the past (a whiff of Austin Powers) before time runs out and the Sentinels hunt down the last remaining mutants in the monastery.There are missteps here and there. The Sentinels are a disappointingly familiar hybrid of the T-1000 Terminator and (especially) the Destroyer from Thor. Even by blockbuster standards the movie plays awfully fast and loose with the consequences of time travel. And the climactic sequence in which the Nixon White House is encircled by--nope its a detail too good to reveal--seems like an event far more likely to have started a war against mutants than to have averted one.This film belongs principally to the triangular affections and antipathies of the younger Xavier Magneto and Mystique.But given the scope and audacity of the film Singer does a masterful job of keeping his many balls in the air. The 70s-era storyline has fun not only with the fashion and the cultural touchstones (lava lamps Roberta Flack) but neatly conjures the look of period film. A central sequence takes place in the midst of the Paris Peace Accords and there are cunning references to the Kennedy assassination (what could have accounted for the magic bullet?) as well as the introductions of a few characters who appeared earlier (which is to say later) in the franchise.Jackman once again seems more alive when playing Wolverine than he does in any other role though the habitrail-diameter veins in his herculean arms are becoming a matter of concern. (In one of the movies many nice touches were reminded that even though he looks the same on the outside the pre-admantium-ized Logan is a more fragile hero altogether.) Stewart lends his customary air of gentle authority to the proceedings as (the elder) Professor X and McKellen--well honestly McKellen looks a bit bored which is understandable enough after four tours as Magneto and five (and counting) as Gandalf.The torch in any case is being handed off. This film like X-Men First Class belongs principally to the triangular affections and antipathies of the younger Xavier Magneto and Mystique. Much has happened since the prior film and McAvoys Professor X in particular has borne the brunt of it losing his powers and his faith. His doubts as ever find their antithesis in the heedless certainty of Fassbenders Magneto. Which leaves Lawrences Mystique as--if youll forgive the phrase--the x factor the weight that can tip the scales one way or the other. Mystique is the principal moral axis around which the film pivots and Lawrence handles this responsibility with a precise balance of strength and vulnerability.X-Men Days of Future Past is in other words not a particularly lighthearted entertainment. That said I would be remiss not to note that tucked away amid all the existential melodrama is perhaps the most hilarious set piece ever to grace a superhero film. The subject is a jailbreak and the instigator is Quicksilver (Evan Peters) the first significant character to be jointly claimed by the X-Men franchise (the rights to which are owned by 20th Century Fox) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The latter managed to get their version (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) onscreen first in a brief credit-sequence coda to Captain America The Winter Soldier. But it will be awfully tough for Marvel (and Joss Whedon who will be directing Taylor-Johnson in the Avengers sequel next year) to contrive a more memorable Quicksilver than Peterss. The overall role may be small but the rewards of this one sequence--which lasts perhaps two minutes--are borderline incalculable. Just sit back and prepare to enjoy yourself when you hear the opening chords of Jim Croces ""Time in a Bottle.""Who knew that saving the world from Armageddon could be such a gas?

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox Professor Xavier and Magneto scheme to send Wolverine back to the Nixon-era past to avert a devastating war in X-Men Days of Future Past. Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox The final ""X"" in the 20th Century Fox logo glows for an extra second as X-Men Days of Future Past gets started but what follows is darker than dark -- a bleak dire future in which all of Manhattan is a mutant prison camp. The Sentinels (soldier-robots crafted with shape-shifter mutant DNA and therefore adaptively lethal) are hunting down the few mutants still on the loose while Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) are hatching a scheme with Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) to send Hugh Jackmans Wolverine -- or at any rate his consciousness -- back in time to the Nixon years to stop the mutant war before it starts. ""Whats the last thing you remember?"" wonders the professor in a whisper at one point and though hes addressing Wolverine thats not an idle question where the audience is concerned at least those of us whove stopped reading comic books. Kids who maybe cant memorize state capitals have no trouble keeping straight the names and powers of dozens of mutants in this series not to mention the twice as many actors whove played them in six pictures across 14 years. Me not so much so when I went to see the movie I took along a 16-year-old and when I had problems Id whisper ""Whos that?"" and shed whisper ""Quicksilver"" and Id be OK. Quicksilver (Evan Peters here though the vagaries of studio contracts mean that hell be played by Godzilla-chaser Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Disneys Avengers 2) is the coolest of this pictures new guys zipping around so fast in a niftily conceived enjoyably prankish slow-mo sequence in the Pentagon kitchen that he can taste soup rearrange guards limbs and nudge bullets off their trajectories all in the time it takes to blink. Everything about him is crystal clear. But X-Men Days of Future Past is as that title suggests deliberately tricky -- designed by director Bryan Singer to allow the audience to geek out as comic-book tropes get rejiggered and previous movies sidestepped through time-travel. Its all but impossible to talk about the plot without spoilers so Ill just say that everybodys acting up a storm (not to be confused with Halle Berrys briefly seen character Storm) that someone shouldve thought of more for Jennifer Lawrence to do that the special effects while spectacular have nothing on Mark Camachos terrific Nixon impersonation that the film is awesomely urgent and utterly forgettable all at once and that it left the 16-year-old I went with bouncing with adrenaline even as she snorted derisively at what she regarded as crazy plot missteps. She has let me just say the makings of a fine critic.

"This Movie Everybody (and Nobody) Dies << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The NBA Self-Mailbag  Next Supermans Kryptonite Facebook Twitter Print Movies This Movie Everybody (and Nobody) Dies X-Men Days of Future Past. Oy. by Alex Pappademas on May 23 2014 ""Its good to see you Charles"" somebody says near the end of Bryan Singers X-Men Days of Future Past. ""Its good to see everyone."" The movie banks on the idea that well all feel the same. Theres something like a story here -- a gloss on a fan-favorite two-parter from X-Men comics published in 1981 -- but its really an excuse for a family reunion as well as the hurried introduction of new characters aimed at some Pokemon-collectorish segment of the audience that just wants to see as many X-Men as possible represented onscreen. If youve been waiting for live-action versions of Bishop Blink Sunspot and Warpath your movie has arrived. If youd like to see them do more than demonstrate their mutant powers and then die better luck next sequel. I know thats a spoiler but lets be adults here. This is a franchise superhero movie thats also a time-travel movie produced by a studio that has to keep cranking out these films in order to hold on to the rights. Its also the de facto sequel to a film whose subtitle was ""The Last Stand."" No one ever really dies nerds. But Future Past doesnt even manage to make us think otherwise. It begins postapocalyptically enough in a devastated New York where humans are herded into camps and all litter appears to be comprised of about 15 percent skulls. ""The future -- a dark desolate world"" says Patrick Stewarts voice-over in case anyones watching this on the radio. But as soon as the Sentinels a squadron of generic liquid-metal CGI-bots finish murdering a bunch of new mutants weve just met the clock winds back a few minutes and their deaths are averted thereby establishing the lowest possible stakes for the rest of the movie. Even the mutant redshirts have nine lives. The time warp is courtesy of Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) who was the main character in the original comic-book issues this film is based on. Her role here is much smaller but (as a kind of consolation prize from the screenwriting gods) shes been granted the noncanonical but highly useful ability to shuttle another persons consciousness back in time. Soon the remaining X-Men -- including Professor Xavier (Stewart never more stentorian) Wolverine (Hugh Jackman never veinier) and their former nemesis Magneto (Ian McKellen never older) -- rendezvous at a mountain temple somewhere in China to lay narrative pipe while Halle Berrys Storm makes concerned faces. Berry gets maybe five lines of dialogue over the next two hours really straining the ""glory"" component of the phrase ""glorified cameo."" Somehow Professor X who has apparently never seen even one of the Terminator movies has only just now come up with the idea of having Kitty send someone back to prevent the Sentinels war on humankind which began in the 70s with the assassination of their inventor Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) by the shape-shifting mutant Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). And somehow Wolverines mutant healing abilities make him the only man for the job because his psyche can repair itself after the strain of time travel. Sure why not? The real reason hes the chosen one of course is that the X-Movies have spent three films and two spinoffs building up Jackmans Wolverine as a character allowing no one else so much as a quotable line. Hes the right man for the job because hes the protagonist. But at least the movie gives him a chance to demonstrate why. After time-tunneling back to 1973 Wolverine wakes up in a water bed staring at a lava lamp with Roberta Flack on the radio and an attractive young lady draped across him; within minutes he has perforated some thugs and made off with their sweet 70s Buick. Badass-antihero status confirmed via the kind of economical character introduction this movie could have used more of. The bell-bottomed production design of the 70s flashbacks is an improvement on the blue-gray drabness of Singers first two X-Men films. The scene where Russian and Vietnamese military brass celebrate the impending Paris Peace Accords by partying in a French discotheque to ""Stop in the Name of Love"" en francais recalls Matthew Vaughns 60s-set X-Men First Class whose groovy first half is still the most enjoyable X-Men movie ever made. Vaughn was set to direct this one too but pulled out in 2012 due to other commitments and what hed later admit was a lack of interest in returning to a series he saw as having always been ""Bryans machine."" But the charismatic younger versions of Mystique Xavier (James MacAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) that lead this film along with Jackman are essentially Vaughns and you have to wonder what Future Past could have been had he stuck around. Ill concede that nobody apart from Vaughn has made a better X-Men movie than Singers X2 but could no one else be trusted to try? Like maybe a director with a strong visual sensibility a sense of humor or some idea of how to stage a dynamic action scene? In a pre-Batman Begins pre-Iron Man world the two Singer films felt like breakthroughs because they werent actively offensive and didnt seem ashamed of their source material. But try sitting through them today. Theyre dour and sterile stiffly acted and curiously earthbound and in the course of two whole movies theres not one memorable image apart from Rebecca Romijn in blue body paint -- although if you liked the scene in 2000s X-Men where Magneto moves police cars around with his mind youll love the scene in this one where Magneto moves police cars around with his mind. The Singer movies did succeed in capturing the allegorical dimension of the comics -- the way ""anti-mutant hysteria"" has served through the years as a go-to metaphor for real-life racism and homophobia. When Bobby ""Iceman"" Drake reveals his abilities to his parents in X2 its written unambiguously as a coming-out scene even before Bobbys mom asks him ""Have you tried not being a mutant?"" Theres nothing allegorical about Days of Future Past and the movies weaker for it. The post-Vietnam setting is just an excuse to set a couple of action scenes in a Paris that might as well be Toronto. The plot is about a fearful society whose expansion of its security apparatus (via the deployment of giant robots) has unintended consequences but Singer doesnt even touch the storys topical resonances. I didnt find the muddled NSA-surveillance themes in Captain America The Winter Soldier as subversive as everyone else seemed to but at least the movie was thinking about something outside the bubble of its own mythology. Theres also no real moral quandary to be grappled with. Dinklages charisma aside Trask is a two-dimensional Science Asshole character -- who must nonetheless be saved for the good of all mankind. A better movie would have actually made him sympathetic then required the X-Men to kill him themselves to save the future or at least forced them to weigh the value of his life against countless others. (Not to keep harping on this point but in this case that ""better movie"" is Terminator 2 Judgment Day in which the Trask figure is Joe Mortons Miles Dyson unknowing would-be father of Skynet.) So whats left? A few amusing period jokes about acid and the Kennedy assassination and Jim Croce. Cool-looking 70s Sentinels like the offspring of Cleatus the Fox Sports Robot and a grape iMac. Plus lots of mutants doing mutant things. The so-and-so-is-actually-Jennifer Lawrence-in-disguise reveal gets old after the first time it happens but Fassbenders imperious standing-up flying style never stops being funny. The fact that Fassbenders far too good to be in this movie actually makes him more effective as a character whos developing a haughty disdain for mere mortals; his Magneto is the kind of archfiend whose first order of business after escaping a maximum-security prison is to tie himself a dope ascot. Simon Kinbergs script doesnt give the equally overqualified Lawrence as much to play but she kicks a lot of people in the head and walks through an airport dressed like shes flying to Morocco to chill with Jimmy Page. That counts for something in a movie that doesnt exactly honor the X-Mens long-standing tradition of fully realized female characters. Storm aside the fate of the world ultimately rests with three white dudes. Chris Claremont and John Byrnes original ""Days of Future Past"" story was effective in part because it came out of nowhere. The issue of X-Men that preceded it was about Wolverine and Nightcrawler teaming up with Alpha Flight to fight a Wendigo in Canada; the one after it is a Kitty Pryde Christmas story that flagrantly rips off Alien. But in between for two issues things got really dark in a way they rarely did for superheroes back then. Issue no. 142 actually made good on its instant-classic cover blurb ""This Issue Everybody DIES"" Almost everybody did even future-Wolverine who had hair like Paulie Walnuts. The story ends in the present with Kitty having saved both today and tomorrow but on the last page we see the mutant-hating Senator Robert Kelly striking a deal with recurring X-antagonists Henry Peter Gyrich and Sebastian Shaw to build new and improved Sentinels. Everybody lived but the notion that the X-Men might actually be doomed in the long term has reverberated through the comics ever since; the Darkest Timeline story would become one of the riffs every X-Men writer plays at least once from the 90s crossover ""Age of Apocalypse"" to Grant Morrisons ""Here Comes Tomorrow"" arc from 2004. Singers Days of Future Past builds to an everybody-dies climax complete with sad slow-motion impalements then undercuts it with a happy ending. No spoilers but lets just say Wolverine kind of wakes up to find that his novel A Match Made in Space has been published and Biff Tannen is detailing his car. Nothing about these last moments suggests theres more story to be told although the obligatory post-credits scene -- featuring our first look at a villain whose identity the announced title X-Men Apocalypse has already revealed -- promises there will be. Maybe ""En Sabah Nur"" is ancient Egyptian for ""It is what it is.""

And so we leave the space-time nuances of ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" for Marvel aficionados to deconstruct. Instead lets celebrate the philosophical ambitions of this fifth sequel in which gravitas and a kind of gallows humor glint like Wolverines claws -- once they are metal that is. But we digress. Its not just the distinguished cast that makes the ""X-Men"" franchise so entertaining. Though its hard to ignore the genius of having James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender once again portray Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr (""X-Men First Class"") and Sirs Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as their adult selves. The elders have been arch frenemies at best. Here they unite to enlist their younger selves in a mission to alter the past. Like 2011s tremendous ""First Class"" (which lived up to its title) this sequel waste little time plunging us into the dire. The future is a dark miserable place for mutants and their human allies. No matter where we go -- New York Moscow or China -- the giant robots known as Sentinels wage utterly effective war on them. The opening sequence finds a group of mutants holed up in a subterranean bunker fighting valiantly the seemingly indestructible robots. The only way to turn the tide on the unwinnable war is to cease it before it begins to stop the Sentinels from ever being invented. This installments twisted genius arrives in the form of Dr. Bolivar Trask -- ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage -- yet another tinkerer in genetics with no qualms about experimenting on mutants in the name of research. Since last we saw her Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) has set out on her own as a mutant avenger. It is her DNA that acts as a catalyst. And her transformation to Mystique reflects the moral tussle at the heart of ""X-Men."" What is the best way to protect mutants engage humans or kill the most dangerous ones? Its the source of Xavier and Erics split but also that of Xavier and the young woman who was a sister to him. Ellen Page plays Kitty Pryde who teleports Logan/Wolverines (Hugh Jackman) mind into the past -- 1973 to be exact. The era allow for some larks. Bring on the lava lamps and Top 40 hits by Roberta Flack and the late Jim Croce. But its not all popcorn-light. ""X-Men"" also introduces the Vietnam War into the narrative. ""First Class"" made narrative use of the Holocaust and the Cold War. A number of superhero movies poke at but dont actually engage history. What director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg are saying about Vietnam isnt entirely clear but theyre laudably intent on weaving mutant fates with those of non-mutants. Perhaps more than any other superhero franchise ""X-Men"" captures the overlapping fantasies of being unique yet not alone and of being a hero but also being saved. Contrary to the claims of Trask when young Charles Xavier argued in his Oxford thesis that mutations made the world evolve it was not to sever mutants from humans but to set the foundation for kinship. These are wounded and exceptional beings. Sure it takes more to get to Logan/Wolverines hurts and hopes but hes got em. Thanks to Jackmans wry and grim depiction of Logan/Wolverine theres a lot of humor as well as ache here. When Logan locates Xavier the school he founded for mutants is in near ruins and empty save the disheveled professor and Hank/Beast (Nicholas Hoult). Xavier has lost his telepathic powers seemingly to addiction. Eric/Magneto occupies a different abyss. Hes imprisoned deep beneath the pentagon having committed a lethal treasonous act. One of the finest scenes has Logan Hank and Xavier enlisting the help of the speedy and mighty petty thief Quicksilver (Evan Peters) to free Magneto from the Pentagon. Its nearly as masterful a set piece as Christopher Nolans choreographing of the van crash in ""Inception."" Only its funnier and easier to grasp.

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 23 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 23 2014 945AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Bryan Singer Written by Simon Kinberg Starring Hugh Jackman and Jennifer Lawrence Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English Blame Richard Nixon. Thats the satirical thrust of X-Men Days of Future Past an enjoyably convoluted time-travel adventure that takes place mostly in a mildly anachronistic 1973 after the end of the Vietnam War and before Watergate with the President trying to figure out what to do about Americas potentially insurgent mutant population. Convinced by ambitious scientist Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) that the solution to the problem is to green-light a line of mutant-targeting drones called Sentinels Tricky Dick acts with predictably self-serving expediency - and inadvertently triggers a series of events that leads to a dystopian future in which humans and mutants alike teeter on the verge of extinction. Its in this greyed-out apocalyptic scenario that Bryan Singers film lays out its basic plot line with their backs against the wall in the present tense the X-Men (or whats left of them following a series of Sentinel raids) opt to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) - or at least his consciousness - back in time 50 years so that his younger self can try to alter this chronology - a scheme that nods to H.G. Wells and Harlan Ellison (as well as the X-Men comics series). The plot details here are so ludicrous and complicated that youd need some really good actors to put them across and luckily Days of Future Past has two fine ensembles at its disposal not only Jackman and the original X-Men cohort (including Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen) but also the sleeker more contemporary models last seen in the mediocre prequel X-Men First Class.The big news since that films release in the summer of 2011 is that Jennifer Lawrence has gone on to become the biggest movie star in the free world and so Days of Future Past has upped her role. Her shape-shifting Mystique has gone from an alienated outsider to a would-be assassin whose actions will dictate the whole of human history.Wolverines mission is to convince the younger versions of Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to help him stop Mystique from murdering Trask (and inflaming anti-mutant hysteria) and Jackman is in fine form bouncing off his pedigreed co-stars His scenes with McAvoy replicate his tender rapport with Stewart in the early instalments. And Fassbender is reliably fabulous fully inhabiting Magnetos arrogance and ambivalence (its a compliment to say that as played the character might convincingly age into Ian McKellen).Unfortunately Lawrence doesnt register as strongly which partially has to do with her roles malleable particulars (Mystique spends a lot of time being other people) and also her status in the storyline - as both the hunter and the hunted she spends most of her time in motion and doesnt get too many character moments. Thats also true of the film as a whole which is so elaborately plotted - crosscutting between past and future while keeping a good half-dozen subplots spinning in the air - as to seem more like a contraption than a movie.Having already directed the first two (and superior) X-Men films Singer shows a level of comfort with both the material and the cast and he contributes at least one brilliant comic set piece in which new mutant Quicksilver (Evan Peters) lays waste to a kitchen full of security guards in languorous Matrix-style bullet time (it looks gorgeous and has the slapstick choreography of a Three Stooges routine). Simon Kinbergs script is awash in banal expository dialogue - the characters having to keep explaining the plot to each other - but people dont go to X-Men movies for naturalistic exchanges a few pithy one-liners will suffice and Jackman puts the ones he does get across with the gruff brio of an old pro. (Among the films principals Wolverine alone suffers the torment of having his consciousness exist in two time frames at once but the actor seems to be having fun).Like Captain America The Winter Soldier and Godzilla Days of Future Past tries to use real-world history and iconography to prop up its storyline and while its allusions arent particularly deep the attempts at contextualizing its fantastical action at least evince a little bit of ambition. It doesnt take a lot of wit or imagination to use Richard Nixon as a bad guy but its still satisfying to watch a climatic showdown between two supervillains - one brought back from out of the past and the other from off the comic-book page - and wait to see who blinks first. Seems like well always have Nixon to kick around after all.

Consider the challenge from a business perspective. You have a stellar property -- a team of superhero outcasts or ""mutants"" led by the telepathic Profession Xavier -- that is firmly linked to a cast thought (rightly or wrongly) to have reached its sell-by date. A prequel that features new actors representing the characters younger selves makes heaps of money but doesnt supplant the original films in the public imagination. Why not throw in time travel and unite the streams? The gimmick works splendidly enough to make even that clunky pretzeled title sing. You know the drill Theres a catastrophic present in which all is lost and the fatal development can be traced back to a single event. The sole hope is to bound back in time and keep said event from happening. You and I cant but were not superheroes. Faced with the extinction of mutantkind via shape-shifting machines called Sentinels Xavier (Patrick Stewart) confers with his old friend turned enemy turned friend turned enemy turned friend Magneto (Ian McKellan) and then directs Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) to grip the temples of Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) hard enough to send his mind into his body in 1973 the week of the Paris Peace Talks that ended the Vietnam War. Why then? Xavier generates great gobs of exposition that can be condensed as follows Blue shape-shifter Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated a doctor (Peter Dinklage) doing Nazi-like experiments on mutants and thereby pissed off humans who got hold of her DNA and built Sentinels. So if you stop the assassination you stop the Sentinels and not incidentally encourage Mystique to give up her snotty militant persona and revert to the much more amenable ""Raven"" -- whom Xavier loved with all his heart. Director Bryan Singer never had the lightest touch but his Superman Returns was unusually ponderous and sadistic and his Jack the Giant Slayer lethargic as if he didnt care anymore. Hes reborn -- deft elegant spring-heeled -- in X-Men Days of Future Past. The special effects dont bog him down They lift the movie to a surreal and more emotional dimension. The Sentinels come in what look like flying coffins a poetic expression of doom. And theres nothing casual about the way in which the human-looking characters transform into their true mutant selves Its triumphant but with a touch of melancholy -- confirming that theyll always be ""different."" After Wolverine jumps through the predictable hoops (Im from the future It was you who sent me etc.) and enlists the sad drug-dependent Xavier (James McAvoy) the duo plus the faster-than-a-speeding-bullet Quicksilver (Evan Peters) slip into the Pentagon to liberate the royally resentful metal-bender Magneto (Michael Fassbender) from his nonmetallic cell -- whereupon Singer executes the movies show-stopping set-piece which is like The Matrixs famous ""bullet time"" number reconceived as a slow-motion slapstick ballet. Bravo Related Stories X-Menas aDays of Future Past Is One of the Most Influential Comics Stories Ever. Hereas How It Happened. Have You Forgotten What Happened in the Previous 6 X-Men Movies? Hereas a 3-Minute Recap This is obviously a hell of a high-priced ensemble and not all the stars are well used. Halle Berry as Storm sleepwalks through her battle scenes Page does little besides squat next to Jackman and squinch up her face and Anna Paquin is virtually invisible (seriously -- where in the movie is she?). But the others have their affecting moments. Stewart and McKellen insert the requisite Pinteresque pauses into their elderly reminiscences and flood their exchanges with feeling. McAvoys Xavier has gone adorably to seed and its fun to watch him find his inner Patrick Stewart. Fassbender cunningly holds back putting all his anger in his eyes and wolfish teeth. Jackman is the one who holds the whole ramshackle construction together His Wolverine now has gravitas. But the jewel of the movie is Jennifer Lawrence. In her human guise she wears a smile that suggests she has dirty secrets (she does). When she goes blue shes even better. She swivels from the waist with robotic precision (shes an excellent mime) and her eyes evoke the chill fury of a blood-drenched Sissy Spacek incinerating teens in Carrie. For all the superb work X-Men Days of Future Past is still a product It doesnt feel as if it has a reason to exist apart from its studios determination to preserve a ""tentpole."" Even on its own commercial terms it has lapses chiefly the climax (featuring Dick Nixon) in which the X-Men attempt to change history The whole idea is kind of lame. As I watched I thought back to more ingenious treatments of the same conceit several of them featuring Patrick Stewart. Theres a classic Star Trek The Next Generation episode called ""Yesterdays Enterprise"" thats dark and scary and makes you sad to see how obviously bummed Denise Crosby was to have bailed out on Tasha Yar in the shows first season for a movie career that never happened. For that matter TNGs two-hour finale ""All Good Things ..."" had a wittier ""unite the streams"" construction. A further damper I admit was my extra-cinematic knowledge of Singers alleged sexual misdeeds -- a scandal that whatever the legal outcome has stopped his comeback in its tracks. Once again viewers will have to struggle to separate the artist from the art. And while Singers work is not in the same league as Roman Polanskis or Woody Allens the X-Men films (in particularA X2) have a potent gay-rights (""Mutant and Proud"") subtext that Id hate to see certain segments of the population link to his behavior off-camera. That subtext is the part of Singers legacy that soars -- like his X-Men -- above the mean world.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 22 2014 Save for later Saved X-Men Days of Future Past stars Michael Fassbender (r.). Alan Markfield/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of I was pleasantly surprised by ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" Given that these Marvel superhero franchise movies are not going to go away anytime soon - not in this millennium - I suppose we should be grateful for the few that actually deliver the goods.Time travel is the centerpiece for this new Bryan Singer-directed installment initially set in the future. A government army of Sentinels mutant-killing robots have forced Prof. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) Lehnsherr/Magneto (Ian McKellan) and some others of their ilk into a Chinese safe house. Their only hope is to transport Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) - or to be exact his consciousness - back to 1973 in order to undo the Sentinel program and make the world once again (sort of ) safe for mutants.The young Charles is played by James McAvoy Magneto by Michael Fassbender. The plot hinges on liberating Magneto from the subterranean Pentagon prison where he is being held for a particularly heinous crime (not to be revealed here). Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) shape-shifty as always snarls into view threatening to take down the scientist (Peter Dinklage) whose relationship with mutants is not unlike Ahabs with Moby Dick. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time What elevates this film above most of its predecessors is the dynamic action filmmaking and above all its wit. (The script is by Simon Kinberg.) The 70s scenes with their period references to lava lamps and waterbeds and Tricky Dick Nixon provide the requisite chortles. The best scene in the movie is actually relatively free from mayhem Quicksilver (Evan Peters) intercedes in a shoot-out with such celerity that he has time to rearrange the scene to the advantage of Team Mutant while everyone remains frozen in superslow-motion. Its a classic sequence worthy of audience applause. The 50 best movies of all time Video X-Men Days of Future Past (trailer) Monitor Movie Guide I couldnt follow many of the ins and outs of the time-travel scenario and Im not altogether sure that the filmmakers could either. It doesnt really matter. Its enough that the movie is fun. We shouldnt also expect it to make sense. Grade B+ (Rated PG- 13 for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action some suggestive material nudity and language.)

"X-Men Days of Future Past | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; x-men-days-of-future-past ) X-Men Days of Future Past (United States 2014) May 22 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli X-Men Days of Future Past doesnt feel like a superhero movie at least not in a traditional sense. There are action scenes but many are suffused with a sense of futility. Battles turn into massacres with the ""good guys"" on the wrong side of the carnage. A whiff of the apocalypse hangs in the air ready to descend and blot out everything. Not since The Dark Knight Rises has a movie featuring familiar heroic figures taken such a grim and unconventional path. To reboot the X-Men franchise director Bryan Singer who first gave these characters screen life fourteen years ago has crafted a continuity-lovers nightmare. X-Men Days of Future Past is more science fiction than comic book action. The Terminator influences are immediately obvious as are those of the Doctor Who adventure ""Genesis of the Daleks."" Trapped in a war-ravaged 2023 the X-Men face annihilation by The Sentinels creatures of war created for one purpose terminating mutants and all those who aid or abet them. Earth has turned into a giant killing field. The X-Men unable to defeat The Sentinels place all their hopes in one last-ditch effort send one of their own back in time to avert the creation of The Sentinels. The choice is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and his greatest challenge proves not to be stopping twisted Sentinel creator Boliver Trask (Peter Dinklage) but getting the 1973 versions of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to work together to save the future. In the cross-hairs is blue-skinned shapeshifter Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who must be prevented from killing Trask lest the future be set. For Xavier that means convincing her not to commit the deed. For Magneto it means eliminating her so she cant do it. For Logan caught in the middle the situation becomes increasingly desperate. It would be fair to characterize the storyline of X-Men Days of Future Past as ""dense."" Its not one of those plots that caters to intellectual laziness. Time travel stories even those that play by an established set of rules are always challenging. There are battles and action scenes aplenty but with exception of a playful sequence featuring a lightning-fast mutant called Quicksilver (Evan Peters) most are steeped in a sense of desperation. There are no grand moments of heroic triumph and victory comes from something more existential than beating the crap out of a bad guy. There is no single readily identified villain. In 2023 The Sentinels wear the mantle but they are implacable terminators - machines without soul or conscience. In 1973 depending on the moment one could see Trask Magneto Mystique or even Xavier as the antagonist but all have legitimate reasons for their behavior. Trask seeks peace; Magneto fights for the salvation of his species; Mystique want vengeance against someone who slaughtered her friends; and Xavier desires freedom from pain. Theres a message to be found in X-Men Days of Future Past as well. Benjamin Franklin once said ""Those who surrender freedom for security will not have nor do they deserve either one."" The creation and acceptance of The Sentinels represents a desire to cede liberty for safety and it has tragic consequences. This isnt a unique message especially in science fiction films (The Robocop remake most recently addressed this) but Singer does a good job conveying it without becoming preachy. If theres a weakness to be found in X-Men Days of Future Past its in the special effects. There are times when the computer generated imagery becomes sloppy and artificial. This is evident in the scenes featuring RFK stadium and The White House. Those look like video game cut scenes rather than photorealistic images of real locations. In a lower budget lower profile motion picture this sort of thing might not be noticeable but it stands out in a film of this caliber. Singer returning to the X-Men after a ten year absence (his last venture with them was 2003s X2) has been given the task of completing a reboot that was begun in X-Men First Class. To do this he has taken a page from J.J. Abrams Star Trek handbook - use time travel and the concept of multiverses and have a familiar presence provide the linkage. In Star Trek that was Leonard Nimoys Spock Prime. In X-Men Days of Future Past its Wolverine. As a bonus we also get Patrick Stewarts Professor X and Ian McKellans Magneto as well as a bunch of other familiar faces. For those who felt The Last Stand was a poor exit for many of these characters X-Men Days of Future Past should at least salve the wound in part. Its difficult to guess how this movie will fare with audiences. In many ways its almost too smart for a summer blockbuster but intelligence isnt always a detriment as Christopher Nolans Batman series proved. X-Men Days of Future Past is the third superhero film in less than two months and even though this one is demonstrably different than its predecessors superhero fatigue could diminish its box office potential. That would be unfortunate because this is the most unique and audacious genre entry in a couple of years and on those terms alone it deserves to be seen.

"X-Men Days of Future Past a superlative sequel review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesX-Men Days of Future Past a superlative sequel reviewThe latest time-hopping X-Men installment has great action stunning visuals and enough solid performances to make it a worthy addition to the series.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. May 22 2014X-Men Days of Future PastStarring Hugh Jackman James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Halle Berry Peter Dinklage and Patrick Stewart. Directed by Bryan Singer. 131 minutes. Opens May 24 at major theatres. PGWith its two-timing plot and double-timed pace the newest X-Men outing is sure to be a crowd-pleasing thriller.In the capable hands of director Bryan Singer who helmed the first two X-Men films its a nearly seamless adventure ride despite a plot that at times strains credulity.Article Continued BelowThere are also some great performances and generous helpings of levity in a storyline that might otherwise have been too heavy for those seeking pre-summer superhero escapism.Jennifer Lawrences nuanced acting even in a blue form-fitting body suit helps push X-Men Days of Future Past beyond typical action fare.  (Alan Markfield / 20th Century Fox)  Were introduced to the grim world of 2023 courtesy of the gravely ominous voice-over of Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) where an army of robotic Sentinels are laying waste to mutants and humans alike.On the verge of extinction and holed up in a remote Chinese monastery the last vestiges of the X-Men have one last slim hope when they send the consciousness of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to 1973 in the hope that he can inhabit his younger self and prevent the invention of the lethal Sentinels.This provides an opportunity to revisit the young Xavier (James McAvoy) and his nemesis Erik Lehnsherr a.k.a. Magneto (Michael Fassbender) whom we first met in the last X-Men film First Class and more critically a younger Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) whose assassination of the Sentinels inventor Dr. Bolivar Trask has disastrously unforeseen consequences.The first thing we see is a lava lamp as the younger Wolverine wakes up in the arms of a mafia moll on a roiling waterbed. Cue Roberta Flack singing ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" and soon were immersed in a nostalgia-filled blast from the past that shifts the mood from downcast to playful.The story then alternates between past and future as complications ensue and tension mounts leading to an edge-of-the-seat climax that is sublimely satisfying.Jackman who has played Wolverine throughout the X-Men series is once again a great protagonist a gruffly genial and wry presence who anchors the film. A superlative actress Lawrence invests the critical role of Raven/Mystique -- torn between good and going rogue -- with just the right balance of subtlety and grit despite the constraints of frequently appearing in a blue form-fitting body suit.Nicholas Hoult reprising his role from First Class as the young Hank/Beast is an engaging and endearing presence and Evan Peters (American Horror Story) is wonderfully cheeky in the small but pivotal role of Quicksilver.As the ostensible villain Dr. Trask Game of Thrones diminutive Peter Dinklage is the ideal mad scientist playing him with a restrained and cool calculation rather than over-the-top theatricality which makes his character all the more menacing.Singer handles the action with typical aplomb making scenes like the break-out of young Magneto from an impregnable Pentagon prison sizzle with energy and panache.The film offers loads of marvelously inventive set pieces though the decision to shoot in 3D seems rather pointless. Theres only one scene where it really matters in the surreal dreamscape that appears when Dr. Xavier dons his Cerebro helmet and makes contact with his fellow mutants around the globe.First-timers to the series are going to find the complexity of the plot and the relationships between the characters difficult to follow. The plot itself -- like most involving time travel -- also contains some glaring inconsistencies that sticklers will be sure to seize upon.But the film is certain to please X-Men fans and lovers of sci-fi and superhero action fare in general. That should be welcome news for the beleaguered Singer whos recently been forced to deal with allegations of sexual abuse.Its Singers return to the directors chair that makes the newest X-Men a worthy addition to the canon sure to stoke audience expectations as he prepares to helm the next in the series X-Men Apocalypse due for release in 2016.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

That I think is going to be the deciding factor in how much you enjoy ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" But not in the way its been for many other comic-book films. Previously the more connected you were with the original material the more flaws you saw in the movies. What the hell did they do to the Mandarin? Superman would never do that The more you cared -- well often the less you enjoyed. ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" though not only reaches back to a favorite storyline but brings together every character it can think of - some of them twice as in one scene the old Prof. Xavier even gets to give a pep talk to his younger self. And the script works hard to knit together the expanding ""X-Men"" movie universe with clips allusions and perhaps a few answers to not just the other main ""X-Men"" films but even offshoots like the roundly disliked ""X-Men Origins Wolverine."" So if youre the sort of fan who is immediately in touch with all that -- who sees a character pop up onscreen and doesnt need to be told what her name is let alone what her powers are -- then ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" will give you a lot to enjoy or at least tweet about. Michael Fassbenders Magneto returns and hes ticked off in X-Men Days of Future PastFOX If youre less hardcore though -- if youre the sort of moviegoer whose ""X-Men"" connection is limited to thinking that Wolverines cool and that blue naked shapeshifter is kind of hot -- then this overstuffed time-travelling epic may be just too much. The complicated story is set in an undefined future (the year the original comic was set in 2013 is apparently still too horrifying to put on screen) in which giant robots have waged war on the mutants and their allies reducing much of the world to rubble. Its very ""Terminator"" in fact and holed up in some Chinese temple the elderly (but now-allied) Prof X. and Magneto have a similar plan - use Kitty Prydes time-travelling mentalism to send Wolverine into the past to keep Mystique from triggering this genocide. Stop the hate and maybe youll stop the war. Marvel true-believers may already be grumbling at some changes -- in the original story it was Kitty who went back not Wolverine -- and casual fans may be a bit confused but once old knuckle-knives gets back to the 70s things take off. Much of that is thanks to Bryan Singer -- director of the first two ""X-Men"" films but also of several disappointing films since -- who returns to juice things up laying waste to Washington and introducing a slew of new and old characters. Frankly theyre a mixed bag. Fun as it is to see the bratty faster-than-sound Quicksilver Evan Peters plays him like a younger even more precious Johnny Depp. Other X-Men are hardly there or sadly wasted (Beast acts like Prof. Xs butler while Rogue barely registers.) But Jackman once again proves himself the driving force in this series and no one looks better in molting blue scales than Jennifer Lawrence. And while Peter Dinklage doesnt make much of a villain (hes that old go-to bad guy the Ruthless Weapons Manufacturer) Fassbender brings a spookily godlike grace to Magneto. So is this movie for you? Again if youre the sort who mixes up your mutants (wait which one is Havok again?) -- well probably not. The modern scenes are a little overheated and the flashbacks require some backstory knowledge you might not have at your fingertips. But if you are an ""X"" maniac Singers given you the movie youve been hoping for. There are easily half-a-dozen new mutants to spot (Toad Ink). The mood is apart from Quicksilvers comic relief quite serious and several scenes (including a shoot-out that Quicksilver mockingly disarms) are terrific. And best of yet if we can take this change-the-course-of-history idea seriously? It might mean ""X-Men The Last Stand"" never happened at all. Ratings note The film contains violence and brief nudity. X-Men Days of Future Past (PG-13) Fox (131 min.) Directed by Bryan Singer. With Hugh Jackman James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence.

"Review X-Men Days of Future Past revives mutants fighting spirit - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES X-Men Days of Future Past revives mutants fighting spirit X Men review Alan Markfield / Twentieth Century Fox Logan/The Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) finds himself in the distant past ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" Logan/The Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) finds himself in the distant past ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" (Alan Markfield / Twentieth Century Fox) Wolverine Mystique and the rest of the mutants have a field day in X-Men Days of Future Past Time travel Peter Dinklage and 1970s kitsch top a very long list of what makes ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" such a blast.Allowing one of the mutant corps to travel back to save a perilous present paves the way for all of the X-Men to find their better selves. And who wouldnt want a chance to do that? The massive top-drawer cast -- basically anyone whos ever had a walk-on in an X-Men movie shows up -- has never been better employed either. It is amusing and at times moving to see the older and younger versions of key characters as they rewrite a bit of X-Men history. And when they talk to themselves well it makes for some special meta moments.Directed by Bryan Singer the adventure is led as it should be by Charles Xavier a.k.a. Professor X with James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart portraying his past and present selves. There is action galore but ""Future Past"" is a deeper richer more thoughtful film more existential in its contemplations than earlier ""Xs"" all rather nicely embedded in the mayhem churned up by the mutants altered states. ""Days of Future Past"" is Singers first time back in the ""X-Men"" directors chair since 2003s ""X-Men 2."" Though hes slated to handle 2016s ""X-Men Apocalypse"" the sexual abuse lawsuit that surfaced this spring make that less certain. If this should be the directors last ""X-Men"" it will stand as his best. X-Men Days of Future Past ups the ante on super-sequels Oliver Gettell As Hollywood studios continue to mine existing properties and milk their blockbuster franchises moviegoers have grown accustomed to a seemingly endless parade of sequels prequels and reboots.

As Hollywood studios continue to mine existing properties and milk their blockbuster franchises moviegoers have grown accustomed to a seemingly endless parade of sequels prequels and reboots. Now the superhero epic ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" opening Friday is taking character crossovers and... (Oliver Gettell) Meanwhile screenwriter Simon Kinberg was clearly just getting warmed up with 2011s ""X-Men First Class"" which expanded the mutant gene pool and polished up plotting which had gotten tedious in the 11 years since 2000s ""X-Men"" hit the big screen in a big way.Kinberg not only reenergizes the X-idea in the new film he erases most of the damage done by the disappointment of 2009s ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" giving Hugh Jackman a real chance to make Logan/Wolverine more than good hair and slinging blades. Jackman steps up. Video X-Men Days of Future Past trailer X-Men Days of Future Past trailer including Hugh Jackman Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. X-Men Days of Future Past trailer including Hugh Jackman Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. See more videos As the one chosen to make the journey back in time Logan is also the one charged with persuading Professor X and Erik/Magneto (Michael Fassbender the younger Ian McKellen the elder) to consider a little course correcting. A tall order since neither is inclined to follow orders. Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) uses her powers to handle the transporting -- only the consciousness need make the trip. Logans job is to stop a single event that involves Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) revenge a gun and the assassination of a scientist. This allows us to watch Lawrence work wonders as her character morphs through the best and worst looks of the 70s in clothes and politicians. The music from the era chimes in too making otherwise everyday moments into ironic observations.As the film opens the mutants are under siege. The 18-foot-tall Sentinels a robotic fighting force is aiming to wipe them out. The scientist who designed the Sentinels is long dead and therein lies the rub. Wolverines conversations with the younger Xs need to ensure that Dr. Bolivar Trask (Dinklage) will survive. It is a good thing to hope for if for no other reason than to possibly see the actor do even more with this complicated villain in the coming ""Apocalypse.""Though the mutants have always had a range of issues that accompany their particular gifts -- Nicholas Hoults bookish Hank also a blue Beast the storms that Storm (Halle Berry) conjures -- X-Men villains at least on screen are rarely interesting. Perhaps it is the motivation that makes the man in this case. Rather than world domination or money its the mutant gene that piques Trasks scientific curiosity. Hes eager to get his hands on some DNA believing it would better equip the Sentinels to save the human race.The idea of intolerance and discriminating against differences has always been a central theme. Yet ""Future Past"" lets the discussion and debate about the mutants status play out across time in fresh ways. Creating two eras essentially requires creating two movie sets. Production and costume design make the most of the details the exceptional special effects have a grand time taking Washington down while the sound -- from score to effects -- is spot-on.There are too many tricks up ""X-Mens"" sleeve to begin to mention but do watch for Quicksilver/Peter (Evan Peters). Its a toss-up whether it is more fun to not see him zip from here to there or when the filmmakers slow the action down long enough to let us see what a card Quicksilver is.It must be said that the director melds the past and the future together mixing eras and metaphors in ways both hard-core fans and the completely uninitiated can enjoy and understand. More significant -- the films emotions are as transformative as the mutants.The actors have a field day unleashing all of those pent-up feelings. McAvoy and Fassbender in particular are electric fighting and joining forces and then fighting again. As it always has been the fate of the X-Men ultimately lies in the health of their relationship. I think the future is safe.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com------------X-Men Days of Future Past MPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action some suggestive material nudity and languageRunning time 2 hours 11 minutes Playing In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Column Reviews Entertainment Hugh Jackman Bryan Singer James McAvoy X-Men Days of Future Past Peter Dinklage talks villainy 70s style Hugh Jackman spoofs Wolverine The Musical plugs new X-Men Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-x-men-days-review-20140523-column.html,200,x-mendaysoffuturepast14,x-mendaysoffuturepast,latimes

Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice is the official name of the Man of Steel sequel The story is thin but Godzilla is roaring good fun (B+) The next time-travel movie to make sense wont be the first but itll be pretty close. Screenwriters jump through hoops to explain how Action A will affect Outcome B or why a trip through the ages is mandatory for mankinds survival. The biggest casualty is usually logic.For the bulk of its running time X-Men Days of Future Past combats such concerns with a wicked sprinkling of wit and a surprising level of structural integrity. If youre going to visit 1973 you might as well take in a little Sanford and Son. Maybe say hi to Nixon. Stretch out. Enjoy the impending apocalypse.It seems mankind is once again at war with the mutants those gifted folks who scare the bejesus out of us mundane mortals. As Days begins a crew of X-Men is huddled near a dark Chinese temple doing battle with some formidable flying robots. For reasons that would take far too many words to explain they determine that their best course of action is to send the mind of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to his 73 body. His task Persuade earlier X-Men to keep one of their own from committing a world-altering assassination.Director Bryan Singer who got this X-party started back in 2000 conjures the recent past in a sepia haze and even manages to work in a bunch of 8 mm home-movie footage. Thats only appropriate for a back story that implicates Magneto (Michael Fassbender) in the Kennedy assassination. He controls metal. There was a magic bullet. Yes Days of Future Past has arrived just in time for the 51st anniversary.The X-Men series has always boiled down to one big question What happens when fear of the other is amped up to cataclysmic proportions? Beating the war drums in Days is a military scientist played by Peter Dinklage. Fans of the franchise will know Magneto welcomes the battle and his old friend Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) would rather foster peace. In between stands Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). Shes like the undecided voter who can sway a really important election.Thats all well and good but the movie earns its keep with inspired one-off moments that showcase a mischievous sense of humor. Days comes to life with the appearance of an impish teen in a Pink Floyd shirt played by Evan Peters. His power is his blinding speed; one day hell answer to the name of Quicksilver. For now hes happy to assist in an elaborate jailbreak sequence that features the most inventive slow-motion sequence Ive ever seen set to Jim Croces ""Time in a Bottle.""When it stays light on its feet X-Men Days of Future Past goes down like a frothy pop confection. Its self-aware without crossing over into self-parody and respectful of the franchises roots and mythology. Then the time comes to change the course of history and save the world and that good humor calcifies into something muddled and familiar. Note to blockbuster architects of the future When your grand finale gets this long busy and convoluted it also gets considerably less grand. Not to worry; things are sure to lighten up with the next installment X-Men Apocalypse in 2016. X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST (B+)Directed by Bryan Singer.

Photo Credit AP / Alan Markfield advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The mutant Wolverine travels into the past to prevent the start of a genocidal war. Rated PG-13 BOTTOM LINE A nifty plot dazzling action and some enviable 1970s jackets make this superhero movie stand out from the pack. CAST Hugh Jackman Jennifer Lawrence Nicholas Hoult LENGTH 210 In ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" a mutant race must prevent its extinction by traveling back in time to 1973. Cultural landmarks like Vietnam and the Watergate hearings play a part in ""X-Men"" but theres a more important reason the filmmakers chose that year The leather jackets back then were awesome. For all its sociopolitical smarts and coded subtexts the ""X-Men"" franchise based on the Marvel comics is primarily about entertainment and this seventh installment is no different. Its a winning combination of wham-pow action and some truly enviable thrift-store fashion. For fans and nonfans alike the sight of Hugh Jackman wearing tight jeans and a saucer-sized belt buckle or of Jennifer Lawrence dressed like a member of Fleetwood Mac will be worth the price of admission. advertisement | advertise on newsday An opening setup involving the genocidal Sentinel robots sets a doomy tone but the fun starts when Jackman as the mutant Wolverine wakes on a water bed next to a lava lamp and last nights conquest. Hes been sent here by the time-shifting Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) to stop Raven (Lawrence) from igniting a future war by killing the Sentinels inventor Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage in a poop-brown suit with hair to match). But Wolverine must first persuade two enemies Charles Xavier (James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender and Ian McKellan) to work together for a common good. Though somewhat scattered and overstuffed -- Nicholas Hoult as Beast is front and center but Halle Berry Anna Paquin and other notables get short shrift -- ""X-Men"" benefits from a consistently sharp script by Simon Kinberg and the energetic direction of franchise veteran Bryan Singer. He uses Lawrence for maximum potential dressing her shape-shifting Raven as everything from a military commando to a femme fatale though the movies best set piece is a prison break spearheaded by Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who moves so fast he can rearrange bullets in midair. It all gets a little illogical and confusing at least to those without the comics at their bedside. Still ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" is fast-paced and cleverly executed not to mention enviably dressed.

And maybe full of ... holes? Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox As the seventh X-Men movie begins New York City is in ruins its residents nearly annihilated. Yet X-Men Days of Future Pasts true plight is overpopulation. The film is so stuffed with characters that including twin versions of Professor X and Magneto scarcely boosts the confusion. The first X-flick directed by Bryan Singer since 2003s X2 clicks in its middle section which mostly focuses on the younger crew of heroes introduced in 2011s X-Men First Class. But that story set in 1973 is framed by another tale that transpires 50 years later and is both ponderous and overcrowded. Very loosely based on a 1981 Marvel Comics series Days uses a sort of time travel to dovetail the two casts. In the future robotic mutant-hunters called Sentinels murderously pursue the X-folks around the globe. Hiding at a ruined mountain temple in China -- cant ignore the largest cinema market outside North America -- a tentatively allied Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) discuss a plan. Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) can transfer the 2023 consciousness of the near-immortal Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to his pumped 70s body. Then he can rally that eras Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing mutie-hating inventor Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) whos about to get Nixon administration funding for his Sentinels program. By killing Trask you see Mystique has intensified -- or will intensify -- fear of mutants. If that premise werent complicated enough most of the characters sport multiple names. The Prof calls Mystique ""Raven"" and he and Magneto address each other as respectively Charles and Erik. And dont even think about catching the handles of the globalized new recruits who make their first X-bows in this episode. One exception to that advice Quicksilver (Evan Peters) a hyperactive adolescent mutie who carries the movies niftiest set piece. He helps Wolverine and the Prof rescue Magneto from a super-secure cell under the Pentagon -- dont ask -- in a sequence that uses slo-mo to depict how the speed demon views everyone elses snails pace. Then the kid has the good taste to vanish and not further congest the story. The filmmakers riff on 1973 with lava lamps simulated 8mm film and a Roberta Flack ballad and also enlist in the Vietnam War. Mystique flits from a Mekong Delta battlefield to the Paris Peace Talks and finally to the White House where she tangles not only with Sentinels but also Richard Nixon (comically impersonated by Mark Camacho). As the younger Prof whos rejected his mutant powers McEvoy gets to be soulfully despairing and Lawrence has a few frisky moments when shes not in her blue-reptile-skinned Mystique getup. Most of the time though theyre as confined as the other actors trapped in their supersuits upstaged by the CGI and buffeted by editor/composer John Ottmans sub-Wagnerian score. At least the droning Teutonic music befits the movies heavier themes. The first X-Men movie opened at a Nazi death camp where the young Magneto was imprisoned; this ones introduction dumps piles of corpses in a scene that emulates archival footage of Auschwitz. Such self-importance is a perennial problem with superhero movies. But Days of Future Past is lively enough to mostly overcome it. With characters like the impish Quicksilver the movie recaptures something of the spirit of the comics early days. Back then The X-Men was all about that persecuted minority that knew the world hated it for being smarter faster and just plain cooler than everyone else the teenager.

MCT MCT MCT MCT MCT X-Men Days of Future Past     Director Bryan Singer Cast Patrick Stewart Michael Fassbender Hugh Jackman Rated PG-13 (sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action some suggestive material nudity and strong language) Running time 131 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1138pm on Thursday May. 22 2014 Thursday May. 22 2014 Thursday May. 22 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram There are many superhuman feats on display in the latest installment in the X-Men saga Days of Future Past.Time travel. Saving the world from big angry robots. A beautifully restored 1973 Buick Riviera.But the nod for the most stunning accomplishment goes to director Bryan Singer and writer Simon Kinberg for taking what could have been a formulaic superhero sequel and giving it humor and life -- while remaining true to the original X-Men message of the outcasts finding strength in their differences. The plot mechanics grow increasingly creaky in the latter half as the special effects grow bigger but theres still enough residual energy to keep it from lapsing into being say X-Men Origins Wolverine perhaps the most reviled of all the recent Marvel Comics-related films.This X-Men installment begins in an alternative near-future where humanity -- mutants and regular Joes alike -- has been pushed to extinction by the rise of superbots originally designed by mad scientist Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage) to wipe out the mutants. But Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Ian MacKellen (Magneto) have a plan.Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) is a mutant whose special power is the ability to send people back in time. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is selected to travel to the early 70s when Dr. Trask was first peddling his ideas before a skeptical Congress and the mutants were disorganized and unknown to the general population. His mission is to stop the robots called sentinels from being created in the first place -- and change the future. No biggie right?But Wolverine only has a limited amount of time in the past because a battalion of sentinels is bearing down on our heroes in the apocalyptic future.In order to succeed Wolverine must convince the younger versions of X and Magneto (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively) both of whom dislike each other at this point to put aside their differences for the sake of humanity and mutants. X known as Charles Xavier back then is especially dubious as hes living in disheveled seclusion (with another mutant The Beast played by Nicholas Hoult) and his school for mutants (seen in X-Men First Class) has been shuttered.Wolverine has to convince them to reel in rogue mutant Raven -- aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) -- who is planning to assassinate Dr. Trask. Its that action which sparks mass panic that ultimately prompts the government to greenlight the production of the sentinels.Everyone got that? Well it doesnt really matter as its a cool excuse for Singer to have fun with the 70s. Its superhero muscle meets American Hustle. From Roberta Flacks The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face to America admitting defeat in Vietnam from Richard Nixon to Sanford amp; Son Singer makes inspired use of the decade as a cultural backdrop.The high point is the introduction of the mutant Quicksilver (Evan Peters) whose special power is to move at the speed of light -- though to him its everyone else who seems to be in slow motion. His big action scene set to Jim Croces Time in a Bottle is the movies showpiece.The time-travel scenario proves to be a clever way for Singer to meld the two X-Men universes -- the veterans introduced in X-Men in 2000 and their younger selves first seen in X-Men First Class in 2011 -- into one coherent world.As the film moves to its conclusion theres predictably less fun and more effects. But even here the acting abilities of McAvoy Fassbender Stewart and MacKellen can make even the most cliche comic-book dialogue pulse with importance. McAvoy and Fassbender work off each other especially well.And if nothing else theres always that Buick Riviera. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Grade A+ The most exciting big-studio release so far this year is ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" It tops even ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" another bold Marvel superhero film for ambition emotion and thrills - the kind that arrive in waves of pleasure and terror. ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" injected the paranoid suspense of 1970s conspiracy films into the contemporary comic book universe. ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" which time-jumps between 2023 and 1973 jolts the 1970s to life as a tide-changing era. This ""X-Men"" audaciously evokes America during the wind-down of the Vietnam War and the Nixon presidency and it lovingly reconstructs a pop-culture epoch that melded kitschy devices like lava lamps with transporting musical hits like Roberta Flacks ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face."" Blending the fighting spirits of a spectacular cast while cogently executing a bifurcated story (based on a beloved Marvel Comics narrative arc) director Bryan Singer revives the go-for-broke gusto of 70s movies. In this film even the particles in a lava lamp forming and reforming into unpredictable globules are more than a period joke - they comically extend the theme of mutation that enriches the storytelling and imagery. With virtuoso ease and emotional commitment Singer revamps devices as old as the crosscutting between centuries in D.W. Griffiths ""Intolerance"" as recent as the ""bullet time"" of ""The Matrix"" movies and as specific to the Vietnam era as the simulation of home movies and news footage in Philip Kaufmans ""The Right Stuff."" The hook is simple; the way Singer fleshes it out is anything but. We re-meet the X-men in 2023 as they prepare for a final battle against formidable robot warriors called Sentinels who track down mutants and alter themselves to combat any mutants superpower. Scientist-tycoon Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) was the Sentinels original creator. Trask had tried to convince political leaders like Nixon that mutants would seize the earth from Homo sapiens as surely as the first modern humans had taken it from Neanderthals and he promoted the Sentinels as humankinds best defense. His program took off only after Jennifer Lawrences rogue mutant shape-changer Mystique seeking revenge for slaughtered friends assassinated Trask. Authorities jailed her; Trasks colleagues analyzed her biochemistry. Then they used it to endow the Sentinels with transformational abilities rendering the mechanical gladiators unbeatable. Fifty years later the Sentinels lay waste to the earth their liquid flexibility making their fire-breathing wrath catastrophic. Under the Sentinels threat Charles Xavier/Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Eric Lehnsherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) - friends turned enemies turned friends again - decide that Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) must send an X-Man back in time to stop Mystique from killing Trask thus severing this apocalypse from history. Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is chosen because he can always heal himself if the process proves too hazardous. One more good reason He hasnt aged. When Kitty throws his 2023 consciousness into his 1973 body - thats how time travel works here - the two are a perfect fit. The X-Men movies have always pitted Magnetos violent Mutant Power politics against the mutant liberalism of Xavier who intends to find ""a better way"" for mutants and humans to integrate and work together for the planets betterment. Big X-Men themes like intolerance toward minorities and their resulting alienation from society have resonated with gay rights advocates as well as older civil rights groups (at some point in every X-Men movie mutants are urged to ""come out""). In ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" everything gets simultaneously more personal and more universal. In the 1970s - the decade Tom Wolfe called ""The Me Decade"" - dealing with mutation becomes a metaphor for individual growth. The younger Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and the Beast/Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) as well as Mystique will achieve genuine maturity if they can surmount despair and embrace their ""most human"" feeling hope. The duel between selfish instincts and the better angels of our nature is superbly enacted by McAvoy whose Xavier takes a serum that enables his paralyzed legs to walk but also numbs his super-telepathy. He thinks hes fortunate to be able to ignore other mutants pain and live only for himself but flopping around his shuttered School for Gifted Children hes one unhappy hedonist. McAvoy is tremendous at suggesting the ravages of empathy and the pull of conscience but he can be light and funny too as when Wolverines mind becomes unmoored and Xavier inquires gently whether hes taken some bad acid. Jackman acts with devastating aplomb as Wolverine - in a world quaking with uncertainty hes usually so sure of himself that the simple sight of him chewing his cigar becomes reassuringly funny. And no one simmers with ambivalence better than Fassbender. He gives a one-of-a-kind action film performance. He does more with upswept hands and knitted brow than conventional stars do with six-pack abs and pumped-up biceps. Few recent movies contain pleasures as varied as the sight of Fassbenders Magneto levitating and moving an entire athletic stadium and Mark Camacho waving his arms in a right-on caricature of Richard Nixon. Camacho captures Tricky Dicks five o clock shadow of the soul. With flame-eyed resolve and tripwire reflexes Lawrence is amusingly matter-of-fact as the ultimate quick-change artist. Shes also honest and subtle as an incomplete adult who has run out of father figures and cant find anyone to trust. The fate of the planet rests on Mystiques blue shoulders and Lawrence soars to the occasion. She inhabits the role so fully that her moments of doubt set off seismic tremors. Simon Kinbergs script rarely lets up on twists or complications but theyre tied to the superheroes powers which in turn are rooted in their characters. To take one small example it makes sense that Magnetos metal-bending capacity will start warping the jets skin if you get him upset during a plane ride. A master impresario Singer assembles a packed bill thats equally breathtaking in its kinetic and quiet moments. The director engages us on the run unveiling the heart-stopping skills of fighting mutants as he puts them through teleportation hoops or rings of fire. But hes downright hypnotic in intimate scenes. When Xavier pleads for restraint with Mystique through the mouths of fellow travelers at an airport his choice of mouthpieces is mysteriously touching from a white-haired older woman with a worried look in her eye to a blooming stewardess no older than Mystique. Lawrence dares to be fragile revealing herself stirred or shaken with little more than a downward glance and a tilt of her floppy hippie hat. In a movie full of visual showstoppers the best one parodies a ""Mission Impossible""-style infiltration. It features an uproarious supporting performer Evan Peters as the ultra-speedy Quicksilver a dude who cant do anything at a normal rate and always finds ways to entertain himself even in moments of jeopardy. Singer films the sequence from Quicksilvers accelerated perspective. The director freezes the other characters as Quicksilver jauntily whooshes around a room preparing clever burlesques of action-movie gags. They pay off in regular speed - and pop like a string of firecrackers. In ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" the wonders never cease.

Starring Patrick Stewart Ian McKellen Hugh Jackman Jennifer Lawrence Michael Fassbender Shawn Ashmore and Halle Berry. (Photo/Video Fox) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated May 22 2014 624 p.m. ET 9 COMMENTS The most striking thing about ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" is its generosity. Huge franchise installments are rarely as enjoyable as this one. They arent as inventive richly detailed surprisingly varied elegantly crafted or improbably stirring. This production which turns on the tantalizing intricacy (or intrinsic illogic) of time travel didnt have to lavish money on an elaborate time-freezing sequence for the sake of pure delight. It did though in keeping with the prevailing copiousness. The film isnt flawless; sometimes too much of a good thing becomes a sprawl. But the new ""X-Men"" directed by Bryan Singer from a script by Simon Kinberg feels urgently important while its happening and thoroughly satisfying once its over. Thats my definition of a really good time. Speakeasy X-Men Days of Future Past A Guide to the Mutants The temporal trip is from a grim future to the not so distant past. In that future Manhattan is a ragged ruin Moscow is a frigid wreck--snow even falls in the auditorium if you see the film in stunning 3-D IMAX as I did--and persecuted mutants plus some humans who tried to help them trudge through subterranean tunnels that make Apples ""1984"" Superbowl commercial look like a walk in the park. As for the X-Men and their desperate band theyre fighting and losing a war of survival against giant machines called Sentinels so Hugh Jackmans Wolverine is sent back in time to enlist the X-mens younger selves in changing human history and improving the odds for our species. ENLARGE Ian McKellen as Magneto. Twentieth Century Fox Wolverines destination is 1973 when certain events involving Raven and her very special DNA became (or become depending on the time frame) a pivot point for humanity. The protean Raven aka Mystique is played once again by Jennifer Lawrence. That prompts me to wonder yet again if theres anything this protean star cant do well and to say that the X-Men ensemble--Mr. Jackman Ms. Lawrence and among others James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Nicholas Hoult Ellen Page Halle Berry Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart--constitute the finest repertory company in all of contemporary moviedom. The 1973 setting a decade after the tumultuous events of the previous installment proves to be a dismaying one for Wolverine. Eager to rally his comrades for a mission that will demand their full powers he finds them in various states of decline or distress. In one sense that is standard time-travel stuff but theres a twist. Instead of the mature famously explosive and all-too-experienced Wolverine going back physically his mature consciousness is inserted into his younger self. This gives him and therefore us a poignant sense of the others--particularly Mr. McAvoys shattered Charles--who trapped in their slice of time lack a full sense of themselves and how they may change the future. In a film thats always willing to leaven deadly serious drama with cheerful changes of pace the 1973 setting provokes plenty of laughs at cultural artifacts--Lava Lamps Pong Ding Dongs sloshing water beds. Peter Dinklage is Dr. Bolivar Trask the villainous inventor of the Sentinels; its good to see this excellent actor in a role of genuine stature. President Richard Nixon is part of the proceedings; played wittily by Mark Camacho he comes off better and worse than you might suppose. (You never knew about Nixons role in putting the Sentinels into production but then you probably didnt know that JFK was a mutant.) And in a film thats as remarkable for depth of feeling as it is for action Roberta Flacks ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" resonates with a haunting scene in which the convenient wonders of time travel bring Mr. McAvoys younger Charles face to face with Patrick Stewarts grave embodiment of the old man Charles will become. At moments like that whats gone before and whats to come merge so powerfully that its easy to believe--to choose to believe--in these mutants with singular gifts as figures in a larger plan. (A plan whose next installment ""Apocalypse"" has already been announced.) But an action adventure stands or falls on its action and the set pieces here rank with the best of the genre busting a prisoner out of solitary confinement in the bowels of the Pentagon; repurposing RFK Stadium into a corral around the White House (its overachieving as such feats go but impressive all the same) and that wonderful time-freezing sequence in which Evan Peterss Quicksilver not only stops a screenful of people and objects in their tracks but rearranges them ever so carefully with an artists eye for composition. A small army of artists has contributed to the films near-seamless vision chief among them the cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel; the production designer John Myhre; the film editor John Ottman (who also composed the score); the visual-effects supervisor Richard Stammers; and the costume designer Louise Mingenbach. What theyve done is distinctive in its own right but particularly so when compared to many of todays big-budget spectaculars that ask audiences to settle for semicoherent stories muddy photography erratic color timing and digital effects so variable if not shoddy that many of them must be played out under cover of darkness. No settling is required in this one. Everything is of a piece and its dazzling. Watch a clip from the film ""Cold in July."" Starring Michael C. Hall Sam Shepard and Don Johnson. (Photo/Video IFC Films) Cold in July Richard Danes a husband and father in the East Texas of 1989 isnt meant to be Everyman but he could be almost any man in similar circumstances--terrified by an intruder who has broken into his home in the dead of night distraught after shooting the man dead. But thats only the beginning of the violence in his life. By the end of Jim Mickles taut seductive thriller Richard who is played brilliantly by Michael C. Hall has been plunged into enveloping darkness and transformed into someone else. ""Cold in July"" adapted by the director and Nick Damici from a novel by the Texas novelist Joe R. Lansdale is one of those movies that arrives every now and then with no fanfare but a canny sense of how to grab our attention and hold it in a tightening grip. The first grabber the home invasion leads to a second the onset of a revenge plot. The dead intruders father newly paroled from prison shows up to exact an eye for an eye on the Daneses young son. Sam Shepard plays the grizzled father Russel with a malevolence thats all the more chilling for its bizarre detachment; you wonder how the tension will be sustained. Yet revenge is only one part of a larger plot that involves suspicious behavior by local cops and monstrous behavior by members in bad standing of the Dixie Mafia. (As you may have begun to suspect this is not a tale for the squeamish.) A couple of weeks ago I saw Mr. Hall on Broadway in Will Enos meditative comedy ""The Realistic Joneses"" and was struck by the emotional range he was able to convey through the casual non sequiturs of his complex character. In speaking of his brilliance here I should note that his performance isnt showy like that of Don Johnson who is engagingly and appropriately flamboyant in the role of a private eye named Jim Bob. The changes in Richard Danes--from fearful to something else from passive to something else--come so slowly and subtly that Richard himself seems unaware of them at least at the outset. In a way thats reminiscent of the mild-mannered hero of ""Blue Velvet""--except that the lure in Richards case isnt sex but the threat or promise of violence--this ostensibly ordinary man just goes where his curiosity which is to say his inner nature leads him. Watch a clip from the film ""Words and Pictures."" Starring Clive Owen Juliette Binoche and Bruce Davison. (Photo/Video Roadside Attractions) Words and Pictures Its easy to spot whats wrong with this fable of dueling teachers and conflicting values--the script which is devoid of spontaneity though full of itself; the script which keeps selling its rigid scheme at every opportunity; and the script which seems out of sync with the times or just plain out of date. Yet whats right with the film is more obvious still the easy charm of its two stars Clive Owen and Juliette Binoche. Mr. Owens Jack Marcus a sorry drunk of an English teacher is a partisan of words and uses them as weapons. (Ten minutes into the movie youre already weary of an insufferable word game that he inflicts on teachers and students alike.) Juliette Binoches Dina Delsanto a partially disabled art teacher is devoted to pictures and paints good ones too. (The paintings seen on screen were done by Ms. Binoche some of them in real time.) The scheme of Gerald Di Pegos script is an argument started by Jack and joined by Dina--are words or pictures the superior mode? Any teacher worth his or her tenure would say that the question is too silly to warrant a response; human expression doesnt cleave into binary categories. Nevertheless the argument grows into a school debate as well as a Jack vs. Dina war in a movie that struggles with occasional success to function as a romantic comedy. (The director was Fred Schepisi.) In the end the only question of consequence that the story poses is whether superior acting can prevail over inferior writing. The answer lies not in the stars. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE The Station Agent (2003) Peter Dinklage plays the title character Finbar McBride in this droll and affecting debut feature by Tom McCarthy. Fin is dwarfed by the trains and locomotives he loves but hes also just plain dwarfed since Mr. Dinklage stands 4 feet 5 inches from the ground or from the railroad tracks Fin often walks first alone and then with friends. The film is about Fins physical and spiritual solitude giving way to friendship even love after he inherits then inhabits an abandoned train depot and tries with diminishing success to shut out the life around him. ENLARGE Inside Man (2006) Clive Owen is Dalton a brainy criminal who strides into a banks Wall Street branch and announces that he and three friends ""are making a very large withdrawal."" Denzel Washington is an unflappable hostage negotiator and Christopher Plummer is a banker with a secret in this film directed by Spike Lee thats partly a police procedural and partly a comic fantasy that revels in the richness of New York Citys polyglot culture. The screenplay by Russell Gewirtz is always willing to pause for an oddball encounter a rambling story or a great tossed-off joke. ENLARGE Cache (2005) Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil star in Michael Hanekes mysterious thriller which finds profundity beneath deceptive surfaces. This demanding quietly breathtaking film in French with English subtitles presents us with one surface after another--videotapes on flat-tube televisions ambiguous expressions on affectless faces--only to reveal that what we think weve been seeing isnt whats there. ""Cache"" is at once a series of puzzles a mystery that only seems to be solved halfway through and a human drama with much to say about the consequences of arrogance and repression.

This back-to-the-future problem is handled with a high degree of ingenuity in Bryan Singers 250 million action spectacle ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" a movie about the erasure and/or replacement of the past that combines the casts of the original and rebooted X-Men franchises rather like whichever ""Star Trek"" movie it was where Capt. Kirk met Capt. Picard.I basically really enjoyed this movie even while lamenting that I was enjoying it under mendacious premises and that there was something fundamentally cynical about its elegiac retrospective tone. In reality this is a middle-chapter movie in an apparently endless saga; if youre not habituated to this franchise and its universe the first 15 minutes or so will be utterly bewildering. But in between the whiz-bang action scenes and the high-flown moral debates - Singers films have excelled at capturing the adolescent moral gravity of actual comic books - ""Days of Future Past"" thrives on the sunset mood of a grandiose final chapter a story of godlike beings facing the end. It feels like the ""Gotterdammerung"" of this particular Marvel story-stream but of course we can never have such a thing or at least not on purpose. (Singer plans to direct at least one more X-Men movie and after that another Wolverine film along with a spinoff X-Force franchise are both contemplated.) These franchises may exhaust themselves commercially in the fullness of time but they are designed to go on forever morphing and reshaping rewriting the past and birthing new offspring.My objection is a silly one on some level the residue of a generation who were taught to buy the album because of one great song and who cling to the charming idea that movies are supposed to be self-contained stories with beginnings and endings. No such things can be said to exist in a cultural stream that consists entirely of fragments. The fan-bait ""stingers"" or micro-teasers for future chapters found after the end credits in every Marvel movie fall somewhere between a promise and a threat Its never over By making an old-fashioned trilogy (on 35mm film) and then getting out of the superhero game Christopher Nolan revealed himself as a man of the past. We can experience ""Days of Future Past"" as a moment of closure and a story about mortality while understanding that in the pop-culture sphere those things are endlessly and instantly reversible. Thats also a genuine legacy of comic books; no other cultural form has emulated the pattern established by Arthur Conan Doyle - killing off a beloved character and then bringing him back - on such a grand scale.Lets see Im supposed to give away almost none of the movies events while still providing some sense of the frame; is that about right? I trust its no spoiler to reveal that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen beloved senior statesmen of pop culture and the stars of Singers first two ""X-Men"" movies in 2000 and 2003 are back albeit in glorified cameo roles. This movies present tense - always problematic in a time-travel story - is somewhere deep into the 21st century when the war between human society and mutants has gone really really bad. Evil human scientists have used stolen mutant DNA to craft terrifying robot warriors called the Sentinels who are not only impervious to most tricks of mutant warfare but can also absorb the talents of mutants as they fight them. Prof. Charles Xavier (Stewart) and his longtime foe Magneto (McKellen) give shelter to one last band of mutant rebels who have only survived thanks to the nifty time-shifting abilities of Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) whos able to undo disaster at the last minute by flinging Bishop (Omar Sy) a few days backward with foreknowledge of a coming assault. Its all very ""Matrix Reloaded"" - ragtag multicultural hipsters vs. the gray crushing forces of conformity - but I dont say that like its a bad thing.Somebody must volunteer to be projected way way back into the past - into the waterbed grooviness of 1973 to be specific - in order to stop the blue demented blur of hotness known as Raven and/or Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence aka She Who Is Cast in All Movies) from perpetrating an act of vengeance that will launch this entire concatenation of apocalypse. That someone of course is Hugh Jackmans Wolverine whose impressive physique can recover from any degree of injury or trauma. And thats where this movie turns into a sequel to the entertaining but exhausting reboot ""X-Men First Class"" in which the young Xavier (James McAvoy) and the pre-Magneto Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) do battle with each other the Russians the Americans and the overcooked early-60s ambience. Im curious by the way Can we use this technique to send somebody back to 1983 and pass some serious energy legislation under President Walter Mondale or whomever? Because its for damn sure too late now. You Might Also Like Theres certainly some color and comedy in the way Singer screenwriter Simon Kinberg cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and production designer John Myhre capture the early 70s milieu especially a delightful scene in a chic Paris nightspot where Mystique ensnares a North Vietnamese officer. But they avoid the ham-handed stereotypes that made ""First Class"" feel borderline unbearable and much of the action takes place in and around an important historical event few people remember the Paris Peace Accords that ended American involvement in the Vietnam War. This moment of Cold War rapprochement offers a key marketing opportunity to Dr. Bolivar Trask (played by ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage) the pioneer of anti-mutant research. Like all true villains this mild-mannered mini-Mengele is convinced that his cause is noble; Trask tells an underling he does not hate mutants but admires them and that the threat they pose will unite the rest of humanity and bring an era of everlasting peace.Jackmans Wolverine is kept extremely busy in this chapter He has to rouse McAvoys Xavier from bitter isolation figure out how to spring Fassbenders Magneto from an ultra-secure underground prison cell and then convince these two sworn enemies to work together against a woman (or she-mutant anyway) with whom theyre probably both in love. There are some truly dazzling effects sequences in this portion of the film the most exhilarating of which involves a guest appearance by the lightning-fast young mutant who will later be known as Quicksilver (Evan Peters) - and whose simultaneous existence in this universe and the Joss Whedon ""Avengers"" universe has been a matter of extended legal wrangling. Meanwhile back in the Stewart-McKellen future-present darkness is falling and the deadly Sentinels are closing in. McAvoy and Fassbender both get considerable chances to shine in the less frenzied parts of ""Days of Future Past"" and the conflict between Xaviers faith in human-mutant reconciliation and Magnetos nihilistic drive toward evolutionary warfare becomes a lot clearer. With human society apparently headed by Richard Nixon (amusingly impersonated by Mark Camacho whos also ready to play Chris Christie if anyones interested) its tough not to side with Magnetos appetite for destruction which is played out on the physical landscape of Washington D.C. to satisfying effect. No doubt Im a sap for finding the manipulative redemption at the conclusion of their struggle as emotionally affecting as I did since it necessarily will be undone in whatever chapter follows. Still the note of backward-forward Marvel nostalgia struck at the very end of ""Days of Future Past"" is lovely and you can leave right after that. (Ive grown increasingly immune to the allure of the post-credits stinger and this one is particularly useless.)""Days of Future Past"" is a massively expensive film with somewhere around the fifth- or sixth-highest budget of all time. It may or may not mark McKellen and Stewarts swan songs in these roles - both are in their mid-70s though they show no obvious signs of slowing down -- and it may or may not ultimately disappear into the general icing-without-a-cake sameness of the superhero genre. If you want to argue that theres something immoral about spending all that money to make a disposable entertainment you might be right. But with this and Gareth Edwards ""Godzilla"" (which I did not claim was the best action movie since ""Jaws"") packing the multiplexes Memorial Day moviegoers have two popcorn-friendly options that absolutely positively do not suck.

X-Men Days of Future Past is maximalist Hollywood filmmaking at its best. By Dana Stevens Nicholas Hoult as Beast and Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique in X-Men Days of Future Past. Photo-illustration by Slate. Photos by Alan Markfield/Marvel and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation If the various Marvel movie superheroes all went to high school together--please development executives do not run with this idea--the Avengers would provide both the jocks (Thor Captain America) and the nerds (Iron Man the Hulk--well I guess the Hulk/Bruce Banner is more of a jock/nerd hybrid). The X-Men would be the outsider kids--goths maybe or drama people smart semi-dropouts who smoked cigarettes and other things out by the temporary buildings. Theres something about the members of this rebel mutant subculture that instantly marks them as grittier sexier and more grown-up than their comparatively wholesome Avenging brethren. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The glamor of the most recent incarnation of the franchise Bryan Singers X-Men Days of Future Past is difficult to separate from the luxuriant excess of its cast. Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Hugh Jackman James McAvoy Patrick Stewart Ian McKellen Peter Dinklage--the credits overflow with an almost comical abundance of bona fide movie stars hugely charismatic performers currently riding waves of critical and popular acclaim. And everywhere you look even in small parts theres an A-list actor flexing her superpowers Halle Berry as the weather-controlling Storm Ellen Page as the consciousness-altering Kitty Pryde Anna Paquin as the appearing-only-in-a-cameo Rogue. Days of Future Past lays on the abundance visually and technologically as well. Shot in deep crisp 3-D with loads of super slow motion battles and shape-shifting transformations its maximalist Hollywood filmmaking at its best the kind of extravagant production that like a Wagner opera can sweep you up in a sense of mythic grandeur even as you struggle to follow whats going on. Days of Future Past is the kind of extravagant production that sweeps you up in a sense of mythic grandeur even as you struggle to follow whats going on. Advertisement Adapted by Simon Kinberg from a 1981 comic series of the same title (with a story by Kinberg Jane Goldman and X-Men First Class Matthew Vaughn) Days of Future Past tells a story in two timeframes that run simultaneously throughout the film. In an unspecified but not too distant future Earth will have been laid waste by wars waged against the stigmatized mutant population. Putting their heads together mutant elder statesmen Charles Xavier aka Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Ian McKellen) contrive a plan to send their colleague Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to 1973. There he must find a way to stop the Nixon administration from successfully developing the Sentinel program a high-tech anti-mutant initiative involving gigantic robots that can target and destroy mutants from the air. Once back in the 70s--where he wakes up amusingly in an earth-toned room next to a naked stranger with Roberta Flack warbling on the clock radio--Wolverine sets out to locate and mobilize the past versions of Magneto and Professor X played respectively by Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy. These two once-dear friends have fallen out for a variety of reasons including their shared love for Raven (Jennifer Lawrence)--who when she turns blue and scaly and fierce is known as Mystique a master shape-shifter who can assume any face or voice instantly. Together with the werewolf-like Beast (Nicholas Hoult) the three men team up to stop Mystique from carrying out her plan to kill Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) the anti-mutant scientist behind the Sentinel program. If she kills him and is captured (as happened in the version of history Wolverine is being sent from) they know a series of events will be set off that will one day put an end to the entire mutant race. This summary is getting lengthy and I havent yet gotten to Quicksilver (River Phoenix look- and sound-alike Evan Peters) a saucy teenage mutant whose specialty is moving at such supersonic speeds that he can play puckish tricks on his fellow X-ers. In the movies best comic action set piece Quicksilver speeds up in order to change the outcome of a gunfight in of all places the kitchen of the Pentagon. As Jim Croces ""Time in a Bottle"" plays on the soundtrack Quicksilver bounds casually around the room adjusting the angle of bullets in midflight and setting up pranks (e.g. a cops fist is poised to strike his own face). Its a thoroughly silly but immensely satisfying burst of visual and conceptual whimsy not to mention a whiz-bang piece of special-effects staging--a scene that at the screening I attended earned a spontaneous round of applause for its sheer virtuosity. Its awkward to talk about the sexual politics of X-Men Days of Future Past while its director is being sued for alleged sexual transgressions with underage men. (Singer has denied the charges and filed to dismiss the first of these lawsuits on Wednesday.) But even if I had never heard a word about Singers legal troubles this film would strike me primarily as a fable about the torments and pleasures of being an outsider in a world that hasnt yet come around to embracing difference. It isnt even quite right to say that the movie functions as an allegory about gay culture or gay rights--its more of a full-on gay romance with every other relationship taking a backseat to the stormy lifelong bond that links the destinies of Erik and Charles (civilian names seem suitable here since they spend relatively little time helmeted up in full Magneto/Professor X regalia). The mens love for the dangerous and unpredictable Mystique--who was raised alongside Charles as a kind of adopted sister--seems sublimated to the point of abstraction in comparison with the immediate physical connection the two of them share. For example since we last saw him the hypersensitive mind reader Charles has become a heavy drinker and IV-drug user a cynical wastrel addicted to a concoction that affords him the temporary use of his legs despite his bodys structural weakness. Its only when Erik intervenes locking eyes with his friend in a you-can-do-this-goddamn-it stare down that Charles is able to put down the needle accept his physical limitations and move forward as a paraplegic secure in the knowledge that he will one day age gracefully into Patrick Stewart (a happy fate indeed). These are the moments Ill remember most from X-Men Days of Future Past not the monster robot battles or dazzling scale-to-flesh transformations but the intimate exchanges between flawed and fragile characters who experience their genetic difference and rejection by society as a source of both pride and shame. A lot of the praise for this unusual degree of complexity goes to the cast all of whom--especially Jackman McAvoy and Fassbender--throw themselves into their occasionally absurd roles without a hint of smirking or slumming yet somehow also without the somber self-seriousness of say Christopher Nolan heroes. But some of the credit must go to Singer too. Hes created a big swirling mess of a movie that nonetheless makes sense where it matters--in its relationships its characters and its heart. Correction May 22 2014 This review originally identified the location of this gunfight as being in the kitchen of the Nixon White House. (Return.)

To wit Hugh Jackmans Wolverine musclebound and muted; James McAvoys Charles Xavier bleary and broken; and Michael Fassbenders Magneto controlled and calculating. And since the story here is to fix the past in order to save the future it has the added advantage of actually taking place in the 70s. (Cue the lava lamp and waterbed.) Theres all sorts of old-school drama on display a prison break multiple assassination attempts a drug problem even juvenile delinquency. (Evan Peters has the most fun of anyone here as a superfast shoplifter.) Also a surprising amount of relationshippy rending and mending.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Alan Markfield) Alan Markfield This image released by 20th Century Fox shows Peter Dinklage right in ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Alan Markfield) Some sequels have such a complicated back story they should come with printed footnotes. The latest sequel in the ""X-Men"" series requires an encyclopedia that can be read in a fun-house mirror.Even if youve seen the other six ""X-Men"" movies you might need a refresher course before you see ""Days of Future Past."" And the course should include 20th century American history.Two summers ago ""X-Men First Class"" flashed back to the early 60s when the super-powered mutants who live in human society divided into two factions. The separatists aligned with Eric Lensherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender). The peacemakers aligned with Charles Xavier aka Professor X (James McAvoy). The battle for the future of their race was waged against the backdrop of the Cuban missile crisis. In the spectacular new movie the aging Professor X and Magneto (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen) are allies in a fight against robots that have decimated both the mutant and human races. The only way to defeat them is to send razor-clawed curmudgeon Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to 1973 to stop government scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) from synthesizing the robots with the DNA of angry mutant Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The old and young versions of Professor X and Magneto will have to work together on opposite sides of the looking glass.If you didnt follow that synopsis youll get another chance when history repeats itself. Or you could just sit back and enjoy one of the loopier superhero flicks of recent memory. How could you not marvel at a movie that includes a revisionist explanation of the JFK assassination a football stadium floating over the White House and the sight of Richard Nixon firing a .45 at a villain in a Christ-figure pose? And your hormonal nephew knows that Lawrence spends most of the movie doing kung-fu in a form-fitting blue body suit. Shape-shifting Mystique gets to strut her stuff from Saigon to Paris where shes fated to whack Dr. Trask as an enemy of the mutants. But in the rebooted version of history her former friend Charles sends psychic signals saying ""Stop in the name of love""Which raises the question If a mutant butterfly flaps its wings at the Watergate hearings will the future see another ""X-Men"" movie? The Magic 8-Ball says We hope so.What ""X-Men Days of Future Past""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 131  Content Sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action some suggestive material nudity and language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Photo Alan Markfield Twentieth Century Fox Image 9 of 9 X-Men Days of Future Past review Its time for a thrill 1 / 9 Back to Gallery X-Men Days of Future Past Action. Starring Hugh Jackman Jennifer Lawrence Michael Fassbender James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart. Directed by Bryan Singer. (PG-13. 131 minutes.) The future as we all know from movies is either murky green or murky blue and so we begin ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" in murk - a murk exacerbated by dark 3-D glasses. The war between humanity and the mutants is coming to the end and now the mutants are down to a skeleton crew. For some reason this is presented onscreen as something really sad even though the movie was made for an audience not of mutants but of human beings. For the first 10 minutes the new ""X-Men"" doesnt look promising. A mix of gloom and commotion its dark and colorless with an opening battle scene between ""Sentinels"" and mutants that takes place long before we have any reason to root for either. But then very quickly the movie locks into a time-travel story that accomplishes two very welcome things simultaneously (1) It gets us out of the murky blue future and back to the sunlit vistas of 1973; and (2) It takes the aging characters and rejuvenates them. It gives them entirely new bodies. Thanks to his physical resiliency - time travel is like air travel only a thousand times more punishing - its Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who gets the task of going back in time to alter the pivotal event in mutant-human relations the assassination of an anti-mutant scientist (Peter Dinklage) by Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). Other incarnations Wolverines assignment is to meet up with the earlier incarnations of the mutant sages Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) and persuade them to help him find and stop Raven. Before he goes he gets instructions from the older men on how to deal with their younger selves who like a lot of younger selves can be jerks. From the point that Wolverine opens his eyes and finds himself staring at a lava lamp ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" is on solid ground. One could quibble about the efficacy of arriving in 1973 to prevent a 1973 event. Wouldnt it be easier to nip things in the bud a few years earlier? But in movies characters always land at the point in the past that provides the most drama not the easiest solution. A character out to kill Hitler for example would never show up at his crib but at a Nuremberg rally. For years now X-Men movies have pushed the idea that the mutants serve no intrinsic threat to humanity and that peaceful coexistence is possible. But this notion has always seemed purely fanciful until now. In ""Days of Future Past"" the 1973 assassination is not just a catalytic event - like say the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 - but a moral pivot point. And the young Charles Xavier played by James McAvoy embodies the possibility of a moral peaceful path. Mind reader The importance of McAvoy cant be overestimated. Charles particular gift is that he can read everyones thoughts and in this early stage of his abilities he cant filter them out. Its as though he were walking through a field of competing radio signals. McAvoy conveys the torment of this - how it might as easily break him as make him. At the same time McAvoy lets us know without ever stating it Charles Xaviers privileged grasp of the living world and its inevitable consequence which is empathy. If he could only instill that vision in others there might really be peace. As the young Magneto Michael Fassbender is more of a hard guy and much of the movie involves Wolverines effort to corral the competing interests and impulses of the various mutant factions before they destroy themselves. As the impetuous Raven Jennifer Lawrence goes through the film in a blue form-fitting second skin that leaves little to imagine except how flexible the MPAA can be when assessing major summer releases. The role itself is something of a cheat - Raven can take the form of anyone which means she is the ultimate version of the hoary action movie device where someone takes off a rubber mask and is revealed to be someone else. At times ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" goes in directions that are far-fetched and unlikely even within its own exaggerated world. But for the most part it entertains. The 1973 art direction is impeccable - not just the cars but the storefronts and the fonts in the signage - and even the songs on the soundtrack are from that particular year. Sense of meaning Most important there is an emotional undercurrent in this installment that the earlier films only aspired to. When for a brief moment the younger Charles Xavier meets the older there is the sense of times mystery - and also of the long magnificent slog of a purpose-driven life. To his credit even in his younger incarnation Charles is too serious a man to exclaim ""Oh no I went bald?"" or even to ask how old he was when it happened. I know my younger self would not have had such restraint. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

But the first thing that strikes me both times is how genuine Ellen Page is. And more gorgeous than before. Her angst over the main predicament amp; subsequent injury pops out of the screen easily shadowing Jackman. Not much air time for Page but those few minutes were worth it. Damion Gibsonsaid on Thursday June 12 2014 73630 PMYoure right Richard this one is the total package Not a dull moment in it from start to finish ""Edge Of The Seat Action"". You have to wonder how many people have gone back to watch the previous versions to try and figure out what weve been watching all this time. Days Of Future Past is a game changer..Nothing will ever be the same. josesaid on Sunday May 25 2014 32752 PMamazing movie love it saw it twice already THE BEST XMEN MOVIE in my opinion. besides x2. first class and the wolverine. Jimsaid on Friday May 23 2014 100900 PMSpoiler Warning It was a great movie but by the end it left me scratching my head wondering what was erased. Like does that mean X-3 The Wolverine and Wolverine Origins never happened in the new time line ? Since Mystique as a lot younger Stryker might have different plans for Wolverine. So many new questions were raised. Gregsaid on Thursday May 22 2014 11358 PMAlways enjoy your reviews. My only ""geek time"" critique is that you say they borrow from the Terminator. However the comic source material appeared before the first Terminator movie. CJJsaid on Thursday May 22 2014 125531 PMI had to comment here because I am sick and tired of interspersing trailer footage within interviews and discussions. And now REVIEWS What the hell Richard? When Im listening to you review a film I want to hear you talk about it not to see footage and even hear lines from the film. Im very disappointed in you (although Im glad you were positive about it). POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

Critic Stephanie Merry suggests 40 options perfect for whiling away a summer day or night. For showtimes trailers and reviews click the bold text in each item. (Opening dates may change.) The Fault in Our Stars (June 6) Dont forget the tissues. The movie based on a bestselling young adult novel by John Green follows a teenager stricken with cancer (Shailene Woodley) who falls for a free-spirited boy (Ansel Elgort) set on teaching her how to live while she still can. James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Michael OSullivan May 22 2014 The subtitle of the latest X-Men installment ""Days of Future Past"" -- a bit of wordplay inspired by the Moody Blues album ""Days of Future Passed"" -- may not mean too much literally without a toke of wacky weed to enhance its time-trippy poetry. But the phrases evocation of chronology folding in on itself is an effective metaphor for the dual settings of the film which takes place both in 1973 on the eve of the Paris Peace Accords that ended the Vietnam War and 50 years hence when the world of tomorrow has become embroiled in another battle this time between giant robots and human mutants. You dont need drugs to appreciate the cosmic parallels of the situation but you might want an aspirin or two to calm your head while trying to iron out all the logical paradoxes inherent in this latest installment in the long-running Marvel Comics saga. The new film centers on the efforts of the mutant superhero Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to forestall World War III by traveling back in time -- from the 2020s to the 1970s -- to stop the assassination of an industrialist that leads to our dystopian future. The plot alone which is drawn from two issues of ""The Uncanny X-Men"" comic book series from 1980 is enough to make you want a drink. On second thought just say no. Not to the movie -- its a gas -- but to mind-altering substances of any kind. ""Days of Future Past"" is in itself as intoxicating as a shot of adrenaline. Its what summer movies are meant to be. Does it answer the nagging question of how Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) can possibly still be alive after exploding into bits at the end of 2006s ""X-Men The Last Stand""? Or how Wolverine has metal claws again after having them amputated at the end of last years ""The Wolverine""? No it does not. And so what? The movie provides enough of a buzz that by the end you just wont care anymore. Plus it wipes out all those bad feelings left by ""Last Stand"" which is widely reviled by fans as one of the worst films in the franchise (next to of course ""X-Men Origins Wolverine""). Because it involves time travel ""Days of Future Past"" can set many things right that for so many fans went so wrong with ""Last Stand."" And it does. Stars of the ""X-Men"" film franchise greet fans at the movies world premiere in New York. (Reuters) ""Days of Future Past"" opens in the future when an army of mutant-hunting automatons called Sentinels have all but exterminated the lovable genetic freaks or X-Men at the center of the comic-book mythology. Discovering that one of their number (Ellen Pages Kitty) has developed the ability to send people back in time the X-Mens elder statesmen -- Xavier and his perennial frenemy Magneto (Ian McKellen) -- elect to rewrite history as myriad movies have done before in the hope that it will change the present. Wolverine is just the man for the job. His mission? Stop fellow mutant Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing robot-designer Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) whose death fueling anti-mutant sentiment precipitated the rise of the machines. Of course this is easier said than done (and it aint all that easily said). Wolverine not only has to persuade the younger versions of Xavier and Magneto (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender) to help him but it also turns out that everyone has their own petty agenda. One more thing Back in 1973 Magneto is in jail charged with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Its a nice touch if a little ghoulish. Recruited for the necessary breakout is a mutant called Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who can move faster than the speed of sound. He steals the whole film in a thrilling and hilarious sequence depicting just how molasses-like the world feels to someone who can get around as fast as he can. The stop-time effect utilized here is a triumph of modern movie-making and will set a high bar for action movies for years to come. ""Days of Future Past"" is not a perfect movie thanks mostly to time-travel anomalies that spring leaks in an otherwise airtight construction. While the 1973 action appears to take place over several days for instance the parallel action in the future seems to take only several hours. But Im not kidding when I say this doesnt matter. Theres a certain amount of compensation that goes on with any X-Men movie. The franchises fans expect certain characters to look and behave in certain ways. Some Im sure will quibble about the appearance of Quicksilver who looks like a surf punk or the fact that Kitty whose mutant ability was previously limited to walking through walls can suddenly conjure up time travel. Yet for many of these fans -- myself included -- the disappointment eventually dissipates not because we get the movie we want but because we get the one we need.    PG-13. At area theaters.

Gone are Brett Ratner and Matthew Vaughn replaced by the director who smartly and smoothly launched the franchise Bryan Singer. The cast combines fan favorites from the first round of ""X-Men"" films brings in the better players from ""X-Men First Class"" and includes some new faces. The script by Simon Kinberg turns the 1980s classic comics storyline of the same name into a time travel cause-and-effect tale that also clearly allows for future movies in the franchise to continue unfettered by the chains of what has gone before. Its actually surprising that ""Days of Future Past"" works as a film at all considering that its really just Fox spending something like 250 million to shake a comic-book franchise canons etch-a-sketch. But as far as summertime comic-book blockbusters go ""Days of Future Past"" has a lot going for it. Its cleanly and clearly shot and cut with wit and humor lightening the bombast and ballast that can weigh these films down. Its also an appeal to our better selves -- a call for tolerance co-existence and pacifism an appeal made by characters who can hurl a baseball stadium at you with their minds or pop scary animal claws out of the back of their hands. And its also a film about yes moral choice and its ramifications -- where a characters decisions matter and matter a lot for what comes next among the widescreen action set-pieces and fantastic fights. The film starts in a bad future -- this was one of the most seminal ""darkest timelines"" from 80s pop culture so its not like its ripping anyone off in 2014 -- where mutants and potential mutants and human sympathizers are rounded up and exterminated by huge autonomous robots called Sentinels who are close to putting all humanity under their metal heels. A rag-tag group of our mutant heroes survives but cant possibly defeat the adapting malleable robots. A last-ditch plan will send the consciousness of long-lived franchise stalwart Wolverine (Hugh Jackman enjoyable as ever in a character he wears as easily and tightly as his own skin by now) back to his own body in 1973 where he can prevent both the murder that made the Sentinel program a priority for the U.S. Government and help stop the stolen scientific breakthrough that made the Sentinels unstoppable conquerors... So hurled back to an afro-and-Wranglers-heavy 1973 Jackman tries to guide that eras X-Men like Professor Xavier (James McAvoy good as a man ruined by fate) and Beast (Nicolas Hoult) as well as enemies like Magneto (Michael Fassbender imperious and magnificent) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) in an effort to re-shape the future by changing the past. The brain behind the Sentinels is Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage mostly wasted) but the ""bad guy"" here is less important than the conflict within the group -- which is all part and parcel of the X-Men tradition in the comic books where world-shattering exterior drama always took a back seat to tortured expositive internal conflicts. Theres still fun here with all the sturm and drang -- theres a great 70s decor joke and a better James Brown one. Evan Peters plays a new character Quicksilver a super-speedster whos young dumb and born to run and his sequence is full of wit and off-kilter charm in both the dialogue and the shooting. Much as the original X-Men comics storyline is changed here this version of the character is different from the comics version and thank goodness for that; as the recent disastrous ""Amazing Spider-Man 2"" proved its hard to find much joy in a 2014 3-D movie that spends hundreds of millions to recreate beat for beat a 25-cent 2-D comic book that came out in 1973 or 1986 or 1962. When ""Days of Future Past"" isnt swaggering though it can and does stumble. One familiar character apparently has a new mutant ability clearly glued on without rhyme or reason to make the plot move so lazily and badly you can see the welds; there are unnecessary scenes; and great actors like Dinklage are squandered. Yet even when it seems mercenary and muddled ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" is enjoyable and well-made and actually about character a necessary shot of adrenaline born of both inspiration and desperation for a franchise that desperately needed one. The great irony is that you could close out the franchise here on a story level but thats the last thing thats going to happen in a moviegoing business environment where selling audiences the next big sequel youre planning on releasing two years from now is just as (if not more) important as selling them the one released here-and-now. ""Days of Future Past"" has the storytelling and the spirit to be entertaining and engaging but that feels more coincidental than anything compared to what the studios trying to do. Its a brilliant gameplan for a studio Manipulate time and space so you can finally make your big money-making series infinitely re-bootable infinitely re-castable and assuredly profitable until it sounds like and is a kind of prayer Forever and ever X-Men.

In the course of three months she has managed to graciously lose an Oscar (her third nomination in four years) swan above the mansplaining condescension of a male pundit who tsk-tsked her for getting drunk in public and burst into the summer blockbuster X-Men Days of Future Past as a politicized 70s soul sister grimly fighting for mutant equality by any means necessary. Its no coincidence that in a scene where she embarrasses herself before a crowd of normals her shapeshifter changes her skin from blue to black and holds her head high under the weight of a righteous afro. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - What fun there is slips in through director Bryan Singers visuals.When we first met her in 2011s X-Men First Class Lawrence played a well-behaved do-gooder named Raven. Radicalized by the murder of her mutant friends (including January Jones plot-haltingly wooden Emma Frost) Raven ditched her establishment name and rechristened herself Mystique.Film Details X-Men Days of Future Past RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time130 min. More Info Trailer When we meet her again in 1973 the setting of most of Days of Future Past Mystique is plotting to assassinate anti-mutant activist Dr. Bolivar Trask (an eerily calm Peter Dinklage). That act of aggression will lead 50 years later to the total destruction of life on our planet.How do we know? Because thats where the film starts in a present-day apocalypse made of gray rubble with jolts of neon purple lasers yellow mind-control pogs and piles of lime-green corpses some fresh and some already artistically mulched. The last of our aging X-Men -- Patrick Stewarts Professor X Ian McKellens Magneto and Halle Berrys Storm i.e. those actors who are happy to collect another X-Men paycheck as long as it doesnt require anything more strenuous than stalking across a room -- are days away from death.

Sep. 13 600pm With help from Ellen Page as pocket-size quantum physicist Kitty Pryde (Im giving names because the film itself doesnt bother) the X-Men seize on a Hail Mary last hope Send Wolverines (Hugh Jackman) consciousness half a century back in time into his younger body so he can find Mystique before the pivotal murder and you know very nicely ask her not to do it. For kicks he must enlist the Professors and Magnetos earlier selves even though the former (James McAvoy) is a depressive addicted to painkillers and the latter (Michael Fassbender) is locked in a dungeon 100 stories beneath the Pentagon for killing JFK.Wait JFK? ""What else explains a bullet miraculously curving in the air?"" glowers McAvoys bitter mentalist who still hasnt forgiven the once-powerful Magneto for crippling him in the last film during the Bay of Pigs. Now in the Nixon era their tensions mirror the real-life fallout of the Vietnam War The Professor is the martyred peacenik Ron Kovic Magneto the unrepentant Kissinger and Mystique the guerrilla soldier who answers to no one but her own conscience.You have to admire X-Mens audacious rejiggering of history to fit fiction. Stan Lee launched the series in 1963 the dawn of the civil rights movement and even at their clangiest the films have never forgotten that these metal ice claw and magma brawls are really metaphors for acceptance. Luckily for the franchise weve marginalized so many groups that each generation can layer over the mutants struggles its own struggle be it black power brown power gay rights or God help us acceptance for bronies.Still all this good-intentioned selflessness means that the movies dont have room to enjoy themselves. Future Past starts fast and never slows down. Theres not a line of dialogue that isnt exposition as though screenwriter Simon Kinberg feared that if he ever stopped drilling home his messages about peace love and social panic we might think we were simply in the theater to have fun. Its like discovering your box of Milk Duds is really chocolate-covered vitamins.What fun there is slips in through director Bryan Singers visuals. When Wolverine wakes up in the 70s the first thing he sees is a lava lamp. Everyones a fashion disaster from Professor Xs wide floral lapels to Magnetos bell-bottoms.As for Jackman himself over the 14 years hes played Wolvie he has somehow gotten more ripped. Now 45 hes so lean that when the sun dapples his veiny shoulders they look like tree bark.Wolverine has always factored into the franchise as an apathetic demigod an Achilles roused to fight only when war gets personal. Here hes stuck in the unusual role of moral compass the Freak of Christmas Future while the younger mutants get the good fights.The best of the gang is Quicksilver (Evan Peters) a fast-moving teenager who cant resist hotdogging as he saves the day. In one showdown while swatting away bullets aimed at his friends he takes a few short breaks to sample some soup steal a hat and rearrange the bad guys so that when the clock catches up they punch each other in the face like the Three Stooges. Hes so entertaining that its a disappointment when Wolverine and co. choose not to bring him along for the rest of the film.Quicksilver will return in The Avengers 2 but the rigmaroles of multistudio Marvel contracts require he be recast with a different actor.

"X-Men Days of Future Past (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review X-Men Days of Future Past (PG-13) The X-Men cross paths with their younger selves in this epic time-travel adventure. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/22/2014 Editor rating 3 X-Men Days of Future Past opens with a worrisome dump of exposition and backstory -- so much information that you start to wonder if there may be a quiz later. Heres the Cliffs Notes version In a near dystopian future a breed of super-robots known as Sentinels designed by a scientist named Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage) have killed most of the planets mutant population (and a big chunk of mankind along with them). Among the remaining survivors are Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) Magneto (Ian McKellen) Storm (Halle Berry) Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) and of course Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) without whom this film franchise would not exist. With an army of Sentinels bearing down on them the few heroes left decide to send Wolverine back in time -- specifically to 1973 the year that Trask invented the Sentinels and Wolverines muttonchop sideburns were still in style to try to change the course of history. This will require the help of the younger incarnations of the Professor (James McAvoy) Magneto (Michael Fassbender) the Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). In other words anyone who hasnt seen the previous X-Men pictures especially X-Men First Class will have a tough time figuring out whats going on in this dual-timeline comic-book adventure. There is no quiz but some homework is required. For the initiated though Days of Future Past feels like a celebration for their tenacity with the series through its highs and lows mixing the older versions of the superheroes with their younger selves (there are lots of funny shout-outs to the previous films). Director Bryan Singer returning to the reins of the series he launched with the first two movies understands these characters better than most. He knows the secret to the X-Mens popularity is watching the group work together each member doing their part respective to their abilities and he stages the action with an elegance and clarity that is rare to comic-book pictures (a standout American Horror Storys Evan Peters shining moment as a teenage Quicksilver whose power is super-speed like the Flash; he practically steals the movie from his more famous co-stars). Comic fans consider the Days of Future Past storyline first told in issues 141-142 of The Uncanny X-Men by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne in 1981 as sacrosanct so shouts of ""Blasphemy"" may be heard upon learning that screenwriter Simon Kinberg has preserved the spine of the tale but tossed out most of its details. (Brief nerd detour In the books Kitty Pryde not Wolverine traveled back in time and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants is nowhere to be seen in the movie.) Those who obsess over plot holes in time-travel movies too will find plenty to write about here. But by staying true to the events depicted in First Class Days of Future Past manages to streamline a complicated plot without losing its essence -- and to bring Fassbenders Magneto one of the most formidable and enjoyable villains in the genre to the forefront. Fassbender takes to the character with the same gravity and seriousness he displayed in 12 Years a Slave and Shame Hes the anchor that grounds this potentially preposterous vessel and gives it weight and importance. By contrast McKellens Magneto now looks frail and feeble like a powerless Gandalf after a haircut and a shave. Most of the near-future sequences in Days of Future Past embrace the worst aspects of superhero pictures An over-reliance on CGI unconvincing sets and major deaths that dont really mean anything because you know everyone will be OK by films end (thats one way in which the underrated Amazing Spider-Man 2 differs from the pack). Fortunately the bulk of the movie is set in the past where the filmmakers have fun toying with history (the JFK assassination finally and definitively solved) and decking out Lawrence in cool 1970s getups at least when shes not sporting her natural blue skin and fire-red hair. The movie incorporates Nixon Vietnam and vintage rock into the story and although the Sentinels look nothing like their purple-and-blue counterparts from the comics they are perfect in terms of what the film needs. The deep cast (look out for a slew of crowd-pleasing cameos) plays this borderline-silly stuff so well there isnt a single unintentional laugh in the entire thing. X-Men Days of Future Past wont convert those who have resisted the previous movies but its their loss really Even more than The Avengers this is the best most entertaining and mature comic-book Hollywood franchise currently in existence. Bring on the Apocalypse.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For better or worse X-Men Days Of Future Past is the first Marvel movie to truly embrace comics-style storytelling. Context-less and origin-story-free it presumes that its audience is familiar with all relevant character traits continuities and fantastic elements. It returns the genre to its geek roots; depending on the viewer it has the potential to be the most narratively satisfying and fluid entry in the X-Men film series or the most alienating. Its a loose adaptation of one of the all-time great Marvel storylines with Professor X and Magneto using Shadowcats powers to send Wolverines consciousness back in time to 1973 so that he can help their past selves set aside their differences and avert a dystopian Sentinel-run future by preventing Mystique from assassinating Bolivar Trask. Readers who are confused by any or all parts of the preceding sentence should take it as a warning. Not to say that the movie is a fans-only affair through and through. Director Bryan Singer--whose original X-Men from 2000 jumpstarted the current superhero-movie boom--has become a more confident stylist and Days Of Future Past is distinguished by several extravagantly designed effects sequences including a slow-motion shoot-out set to Jim Croces ""Time In A Bottle"" and an opening battle that pits space-warping Blink (Fan Bingbing) against a gaggle of Sentinels with combatants leaping through portals that appear as different spatial planes on the surface of the 3-D screen. The period signage--lava lamps shearling coats wocka-wocka guitars Sanford And Son Pong--is broad enough to occasionally register as parody and like its predecessor X-Men First Class the movie has a lot of fun integrating historical events into its fictional universe. The Paris peace accords the JFK assassination and the missing 18 minutes from Nixons Watergate tapes all get an X-Men spin. It doesnt take a specialist to enjoy any of these things but understanding the plot the characters and their actions is a different matter. No blockbuster sequel in recent memory has put so little effort into involving first-timers; it requires a familiarity with X-Men The Last Stand and X-Men First Class (as it functions as a sequel to both) and a working knowledge of the source material. Viewers who dont know that Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is supposed to have an adamantium skeleton or that Quicksilver (Evan Peters) is Magnetos son will be confused by certain scenes. Those unfamiliar with the X-Men--the differing personas of the older Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) and their younger selves (James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively) or their relationship with shape-shifting Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence)--are likely to be confounded for the most of the movies 131 minutes. The satisfaction of watching any given actor comes half from performance half from interpretation. At its laziest this kind of extra-textualism ends up producing something like the final act of Star Trek Into Darkness in which the only entertainment comes from rephrasings of Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan. Days Of Future Past on the other hand is geek storytelling done right more or less. Rather than leaning on references for fan entertainment value--what critic Pat Graham writing about the original Star Trek movies once called ""the ritual appreciation of familiar iconography and themes""--the movie uses the audiences presumed fandom to move faster and go further than it could if it were continually stopping to reintroduce characters and explain the setting. Its not a coincidence that in addition to being the least newcomer-friendly big-budget movie of the year so far Days Of Future Past is also the most narrative-driven. Juggling (and reconciling) different versions of the same characters across multiple timelines it produces something akin to the sprawl of a decades-old superhero universe.For thoughts on and a place to discuss the plot details we cant reveal in our review visit X-Men Days of Future Pasts Spoiler Space.

Director Bryan Singer (211). PG-13 Comic-book violence. Area theaters. In 3-D where available. Brief nudity language violence. Time travel can heal all wounds. But it also can be a real killer. Skipping between eras ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" fights a war on two fronts. The movie finds a lot of success largely due to solid work from a lot of extraordinary actors. They maneuver around a jam-packed plot that in lesser hands could have left you looking at your watch. This seventh X-Men adventure the previous being the successful ""X-Men First Class"" (2011) does have an overly cerebral story. The fact that it engages an audience is in itself an accomplishment. Things start in the year 2023 in an apocalyptic future world in which amazingly powered mutants are being hunted down and exterminated by giant robots called Sentinels. Things dont look good for those who can flick their tongues like a toad. In a remote stronghold aging Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) his foe-turned-ally Erik aka Magneto (Ian McKellan) Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) have sought out Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) for a dangerous untested last-ditch effort. Kitty a telepath must send someones consciousness back into the past to stop the Sentinels from being created. Logan volunteers since his healing power will help his brain regenerate while its being messed with. Logans 2023 mind wakes up in 1973. Now in his Nixon-era physical self Logan has to find the thirtysomething Xavier (James McAvoy) free the young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) from prison and stop Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing a scientist named Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). Trask is the inventor of the Sentinels and after Raven shoots him her shape-shifting DNA will be harvested and injected into the Sentinels to make them indestructible. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique in X-Men Days of Future Past. (Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox) Hugh Jackman returns as Logan/Wolverine. (Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox) Peter Dinklage is Dr. Bolivar Trask in X-Men Days of Future Past. (Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox) Members of the X-Men include (from left) Sun Spot (Adan Canto) Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). (Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox) Theyre joined by Hank (Nicolas Hoult) who becomes the furry blue Beast and Peter (Evan Peters) a kid who can move fast as quicksilver. But for all the transplanting of football stadiums and theorizing about ""the immutability of time"" what ultimately can change the future is a single moment of individual decision. Thats a powerful concept. And the talents behind ""Days of Future Past"" know it. Previously this franchise relied on the mutants as metaphor. Indeed their stories begged us to overcome the fear and distrust we have of anyone different. Here thats all just part of the fabric of the tale. The ""one act can change the world"" notion is the driving force. Its also a roadblock. The movie sometimes has the feel of an Olympic sprinter running in place. Theres so much energy expended to get to one spot. Constant searches beget more searches. It all gets exhausting. Still the strength of the ""X-Men"" movies has always been in the actors and the way they and the filmmakers effortlessly ease us into a world where some people are born with superpowers. (It helps that theres never the burden of telling any one characters origin story.) The central quartet -- playing two characters young and old -- is McAvoy Stewart Fassbender and McKellan. This is about as strong a team as you could want. The dissolute 70s Xavier -- able to walk again thanks to a drug that heals his spine but numbs his powers -- must hint at the gravitas of his older self and McAvoy is up to the job. Stewart meanwhile fine-tunes his persona as the cinematic avatar of humane intelligence and leadership. Fassbender makes sure we never really know where Magnetos motives and madness lie. Ian McKellan as Magneto (top) and Patrick Stewart as Xavier reunite in X-Men Days of Future Past. (Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox) Beast (Nicholas Hoult) lashes out at Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) in X-Men Days of Future Past (Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox) Lawrence is able to maintain dignity while running around naked and painted blue. Shes a gorgeous kick-throwing Manchurian Candidate. Dinklage adds nuance where its least expected. And Jackman who has made the clawed ageless Logan into a Hamlet for moviegoing millennials makes a welcome return. Their efforts here are never for naught. But the biggest villain ""Days of Future Past"" fights -- and never really vanquishes -- is our collective memory of all their yesterdays.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 759 p.m. EDT May 22 2014Nicholas Hoult left James McAvoy and Hugh Jackman in a scene from the motion picture ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" CREDT Alan Markfield 20th Century Fox [Via MerlinFTP Drop](Photo Alan Markfield 20th Century Fox)The most ambitious and ingenious of the long-running series X-Men Days of Future Past keeps the key crew of mutants busier than ever.Between globe-hopping time-traveling and employing their various powers early and often these superhuman folks are non-stop in this riveting sequel (   1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).They pretty much have to be given that the survival of mutant-kind is at stake.A quartet of X-Men must stop the shape-shifting Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from a deed that will change the course of their lives. X-Mens multigenerational cast is slyly funny and thoroughly compelling. The intricately plotted Marvel Comics-based tale is full of spectacle but also playful and powerfully emotional.Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is sent back five decades from 2023 to change the course of history and alter the future. Hes sent by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen) at a time when the world is ravaged and annihilation looms.The action toggles between a dystopian future and 1973 vaulting across continents from Moscow to Washington D.C. to Saigon.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare After six X-Men films theres a lot to keep track of in the new Days of Future Past. USA TODAYs Brian Truitt tells Carly Mallenbaum what you should know before heading to the theater. Its been 14 years since the first X-Men film and the power of the series lies in how it has embraced the characters distinctive other-ness. Unlike such venerated superheroes as Superman and Spiderman whose general physicality remains unchanged as they perform heroic feats this legion has been marginalized even reviled for the physical abnormalities and vulnerabilities that accompany their superpowers.The series has always been about the characters humanity and that resonates even more powerfully with this richly detailed installment. Audiences get a visceral understanding of the mutants emotional experience.The film opens with Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) using her mental powers to transport Logan/Wolverine back 50 years from a remote hideout in China to bustling New York City during the Nixon years.His mission is to save mutants from annihilation by robotic ""sentinels"" created by Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage). Wolverine must stop Mystique from killing Trask and keep Mystique from being captured and having DNA extracted to further the cause of mutant genocide.Its a labyrinthine dance that may or may not line up with every detail in past X-Men sagas. But dont worry about fitting all the pieces together. too hard to Just sit back and enjoy.Wolverine enlists the help of the 50-years-younger Xavier (James McAvoy) and Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) as instructed by their older versions. He is also assisted by Hank/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and briefly Peter/Quicksilver (Evan Peters).McAvoy and Fassbender inhabit their parts almost as superbly as veterans Stewart and McKellen. Wolverines sardonic wit is established just after hes sent back in time and wakes up sloshing on a water bed gazing at a lava lamp. Hes both brawny and soulful.Lawrence takes to her amplified role nimbly --its hard to imagine anyone better suited to the part.Several scenes leave an indelible impression especially one involving Quicksilver whose speedy powers can stop time. Amid perilous goings-on inside the Pentagon he freezes everyone and runs around mischievously to the tune of Jim Croces Time in a Bottle stopping bullets and turning a bad guys hand into a fist so he can punch himself. Its an inventive blend of visuals and musical score.And then theres the surprising connection between the X-Men and a past President.In its exploration of differences this character-driven X-Men blends emotional resonance with grand spectacle humor and intimate storytelling.Think of it as a thrill ride with gravitas. 276 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1gQTUh6",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/21/x-men-days-of-future-past-review/9392745/,200,x-mendaysoffuturepast38,x-mendaysoffuturepast,usatoday
"Review X-Men Days of Future Past is timeless - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview X-Men Days of Future Past is timelessBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News correspondentPosted 05/21/2014 030000 PM PDTUpdated 05/22/2014 062631 AM PDT Captain Kirk and company tinkered with time travel to help out the whales in ""Star Trek IV The Voyage Home."" Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fought with an older version of himself (Bruce Willis) to change the future in ""Looper.""Now its Wolverines turn. In ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" the mutant with anger issues tight-fitting jeans and talons that could rip your heart out (played by Hugh Jackman in fine form) must go back in time to prevent Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from committing a game-changing mistake.Fresh off 2011s terrific Cuban missile-crisis-themed ""X-Men First Class"" Marvels mutant characters are back in action for their biggest most daring adventure yet. This time the younger and older versions of these complex characters wrangle with what fear-mongering scientist Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage of ""Game of Thrones"") has whipped up in 1973 -- robots called Sentinels that pose a grave threat to humans and mutants alike.The movie opens in 2023 with a gripping doom-and-gloom mood reminiscent of the first ""Terminator."" Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Storm (Halle Berry) are holed up with other mutants -- some new to the film franchise -- as the seemingly unstoppable Sentinels advance. Its up to Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) to use her special abilities to whisk Wolverines consciousness back to the 70s so he can alter the future.Advertisement Already thats a lot of characters and a star-studded cast so bear with me here because there are more big names to come. When Wolverine returns to 70s America he hustles over to explain whats going down with younger versions of Xavier (James McAvoy a standout) whos lost his will and ability to read minds and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) whos imprisoned in the Pentagon. When hes not hanging out with Beast (Nicholas Hoult) Wolverines most entertaining adventures come when hes with Quicksilver (Evan Peters who steals every scene hes in) a lightning-fast teen with twitchy fingers and a Red Bull jumpiness.This set-up should sound familiar to ""X-Men"" comic book fans since the film draws inspiration from the story arc created by comic writer Chris Claremont who has a cameo. And if your eyes glazed over at that last sentence and plot synopsis stay with me. Even those suffering from superhero burnout after the release of ""Captain America Winter Soldier"" (fantastic) and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" (feeble) should give this witty thrill ride the benefit of the doubt.Largely responsible for turning the fifth ""X-Men"" film (not counting those two Wolverine spinoffs) into a comic-book movie with vision and smarts is filmmaker Bryan Singer who directed 2000s ""X-Men"" and 2003s ""X2."" Once again in the directors chair Singer delivers not only numerous ""wow"" moments like an ingenious slow-mo sequence in a kitchen that involves bullets and Quicksilver but makes the whole massive production not only cerebral and symbolic but so much fun to watch. (Be sure to stay through the end credits for more). Remarkably all parts do come together from the massive slate of characters that never gets unwieldy to the ambitious production design and special effects. The material Singers working with was adapted with high spirits by screenwriter Simon Kinberg with story input from Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman.Singer and Kinberg take thorough advantage of the time period bringing up Vietnam and going further back to revisits JFKs assassination (heck even Richard Nixon played by Mark Camacho pops up). They also expand on ""X-Mens"" themes on the wrongness of racism homophobia intolerance and war. And therein lies what separates ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" from the tag-the-bases likes of ""Spider-Man 2."" ""Days of Future Past"" toys with history but stays true to its outsider roots expressing them with conviction and a sense of narrative sure-footedness.

Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) must return to the past to prevent an event that will set disaster in motion. Its smart and fun.Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique in X-Men Days of Future Past.(Photo 20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics review 4 starsSinger returns to the franchise with a sure hand.Jackmans performance is the most intriguing with a new take on Wolverine.Fassbender always provides an air of mystery and perhaps danger.""X-Men Days of Future Past"" does just about everything youd hope an all-star time-traveling summer blockbuster should.Better still Bryan Singers film does it all quite well. Or mostly well lets say -- with a packed cast a few characters are bound to get short shrift and as with any movie that moves back and forth in time there are going to be some rough logistical patches. But this is a smart movie a treat for fans of the comics and the franchise. And its a lot of fun.RELATED James McAvoys biggest fight Bill HaderThe film begins in a (what else) dystopian future where the mutants and their human allies are fighting a losing battle against Sentinels giant lethal robots invented by Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) that even the X-Men cant conquer.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare In X-Men Days of Future Past the mutants must enlist the help of their younger selves to save their future. Thanks to Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) and her power of ... well who knows helping peoples consciousness go back in time is close enough the mutants are able to live to fight another day. But time is dwindling with Sentinels in pursuit. So Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lehnsherr (Ian McKellen) -- yes working together -- decide to send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to a key moment in 1973 to prevent an event that will prove disastrous for their and everyone elses future.Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique in X-Men Days of Future Past. (Photo 20th Century Fox)This of course means working with the 1973 versions of Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender). This is difficult because the former is addicted to a serum that gives him the use of his legs but blunts his powers and the latter is jailed deep below the Pentagon for his supposed role in one of the centurys more-momentous crimes.Also they hate each other.But this is all for a higher calling as Xavier keeps trying to convince Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who has gone rogue. Along the way in the future or the past well also see Beast (Nicholas Hoult) Storm (Halle Berry) Bishop (Omar Sy) and many more. This is an all-out war for survival after all so all hands are on deck.RELATED Stewart donates X-Men costumes to museumThe best set piece takes place in the past with a young Quicksilver (Evan Peters) using his superspeed during a high-risk prison break. Singer slows everything down (except Quicksilver naturally) so that we see things from the mutants perspective.And the choice of musical accompaniment is hilariously spot-on.Of all the performances Jackmans is the most intriguing which is not surprising given that he is the only actor playing the same role in both time periods. The normally impulsive Wolverine is toned down here. Hes seen the future after all so he brings a built-in wisdom to his visit to the past. Jackman seems to be having fun.But if you want mystery you have to love Fassbender. You can never be quite sure what Erik is up to and his face-to-face confrontation with Xavier is another of the films highlights.Hugh Jackman as Wolverine from the film X-Men Days of Future Past. (Photo 20th Century Fox)So whats missing? For a non-fanatic the witty banter of an Avengers get-together. Granted this is supposed to be serious stuff but if you pull back its still grown men and women romping around in costumes and the Avengers bring a self-awareness of this to the screen.But thats a minor quibble. With ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" Singer has advanced the summer season nicely.RELATED Top 10 time-travel moviesReview X-Men Days of Future Past 4 starsDirector Bryan Singer.Cast Hugh Jackman Patrick Stewart Ian McKellen.Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action some suggestive material nudity and language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"X-Men Days of Future Past Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review X-Men Days of Future Past  Video Latest fast-paced X-Men film loaded with mutants Chicago Tribune entertainment reporter Christopher Borrelli reviews ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" and wonders if he himself is an X-Man. Chicago Tribune entertainment reporter Christopher Borrelli reviews ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" and wonders if he himself is an X-Man. Christopher BorrelliContact Reporter About midway into the latest X-Men flick Bryan Singers generous delightfully convoluted ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" there is a prison break so exuberant and uncharacteristic of superhero movies that you sit up a bit in your seat. You feel the audience around you snapping to. Not because Singers return to the 14-year-old film franchise feels undernourished (it doesnt). Or what comes before seems perfunctory (its not). But because the sequence -- Wolverine the Pentagon and ""Sanford amp; Son"" -- is so eccentric youre reminded that a little charm has been in the contract between audiences and superheroes all alongOh right its supposed to be fun. For more than 50 years the Marvel Universes innovation grounding its characters with relatable everyday problems has been its calling card. But in 2014 that back and forth between metaphorical angst and CGI spectacle played out several times a year in 3-D and heralded with ongoing marketing maelstroms lapses into an insistent schematic ho-hum-ity. The superhero genre like the Western before it is in serious danger of becoming too familiar. Peter Parker has love troubles (but first another throwdown in Times Square) Iron Man is full of hubris (but the suit is cool) Hulk prefers to smash (but Hulk depressed). I enjoy many of these films but like soap operas without end over-determinism settles in and air gets sucked out. That prison break though.It features Jim Croce. Also a coffee tasting. And duct tape steely Michael Fassbender aviator goggles some slapstick and the fastest most cheerfully annoying man alive Quicksilver (an excellent Evan Peters from TVs ""American Horror Story""). As much as a pricey box-office-savvy international franchise can indulge in fun anymore it does here. And the audience perhaps more obligated to than elated over superhero movies lately brightens. Because Singers own innovation while not straying so far from Marvels playbook is subtle Stay light without being frivolous remain emotionally committed without lapsing into imaginary gravitas. In a genre in which cities are flattened and worlds destroyed with offhanded frequency ""Days of Future Past"" -- despite yes flattening our world -- walks a rare line between casual and urgent. Since the outcome for the bad guys is not promising and the audience instinctively understands this Singer looks for curlicues gags expressions always keeping the drama between the X-Men themselves.Which is wise.There is so much plot in ""Days of Future Past"" that slavish reverence for the material (or the grander Marvel game plan) would verge on the morbid; the film is adapted from a beloved deeply confusing early 1980s X-Men storyline by Chris Claremont. Indeed when the lights came up in the theater and the credits rolled the person beside me leaned over ""I didnt know the Fantastic Four were going to be in this."" This person was serious. I assured her that the Fantastic Four were not in the X-Men. But I sympathized There have been so many X-Men spread over seven movies now so many alliances and machinations a moviegoer should receive flashcards at the door. There are approximately 5621 X-Men in this film There is the guy with black eyeballs the guy who shoots tattoos the guy with a toad tongue the woman who can rip the fabric of the universe. Theres a character named Warpath whose power is staring off meaningfully into misty canyons; a character who is his own toboggan; a character who transforms into a campfire and another who generates fire balls.Theres a lot of redundancy in the X-Men locker room. And those are just the secondary characters.You can almost understand why Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage with a B-movie flair for villainy) is so eager to thin the herd. Problem is when the film opens hes thinned the herd a lot Its the future and mutantkind (and mankind) are endangered because Trask created killer robots to seek out the mutant gene that allows fireballing and such. The war got away from everyone. Trask is nominally the bad guy but mostly the plot motivation. After an opening salvo of quasi-Holocaust imagery -- a nod to Singers first X-Men film which established Ian McKellens anti-villain Magneto as an Auschwitz survivor -- the remaining X-Men retreat into a temple at the top of a mountain in China. There a patient Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and ornery Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) -- and Halle Berrys Storm and Ellen Pages Kitty Pryde and several others (seriously no flash cards?) -- decide (stay with me now) to send Wolverine back to 1973 and the origin point of their extinction.Can they change history? And if so dear God the ramifications ... The Captain might never meet Tennille.As for that plan Kitty whose powers include an ability to send a consciousness back in time must place her hands on the side of Wolverines head and work her magic. She does this seemingly for days -- hands on a hard body indeed. Once safely metaphysically in 1973 Wolverine in his younger self has to find the younger Professor X (James McAvoy) and younger Magneto (Fassbender) and convince them to work together to locate well-meaning blue-skinned shape-shifter Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). If she succeeds in assassinating Trask the U.S. government and Richard Nixon not about to be pushed around by some hippie freaks will weaponize her cells and initiate Trasks plan to hunt capture and destroy the X-Men.Whew.A lot of plot. The film brings together the cast of the original X-Men films and the upstarts of the clever 2011 reboot ""X-Men First Class"" -- effectively teaming up several generations of X-Men (and ensuring that someone seated behind you will be asking ""Wait OK who is that again?""). And yet Singer keeps what matters clear and snappy enough. And what matters here aside from a handful of impressive (albeit warily inevitable) special-effects smack-downs are merely four actors McAvoy Fassbender and Lawrence with Jackman serving more or less as the connector between casts and time periods. The core of the movie is a triangle of strong wills and the fragile alliance between Magneto and Professor X plays out with poignancy particularly between their older selves who wonder why they spent those years bickering. Fassbender seems to retreat a bit too coldly into Magneto (the playful warmth of McKellen barely registers) and Lawrence a cog in a gigantic pastiche struggles to work up her usual spunk and urgency. Strutting through an airport in a floppy suede hat and Joni Mitchell garb shes relegated to Instagram J-Law. The film belongs to McAvoy.Aside from the funny use of Wolverines leather bomber a lava lamp and a water bed Singer doesnt have as much fun with the 70s setting as say Lawrence did in ""American Hustle."" That ""Days of Future Past"" barely acknowledges here the civil rights subtext of early X-Men comics is an especially lost opportunity. But McAvoy who plays Professor X as a 60s washout in the first half charts a convincing archetypal 60s-70s path. He goes from early idealism to burnout and disillusionment then back again. He lives isolated in a castle taking a special drug to numb the pain of being able to listen in on the thoughts of the entire world. When he shoots up (tying off his arm in a soft 70s light) the drug allows him to regain the use of his legs. But the drug also dulls his powers including his ability to read thoughts to sympathize. Its a remarkable invention a superhero whose directive is empathy first butt-kicking second. The needle and the damage done indeed. cborrellitribune.com""X-Men Days of Future Past"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG- 13 (for sequences of intense sci-fi violence and action some suggestive material nudity and language)Running time 211Opens Thursday night Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Reviews Latest movie reviews X-Men Days of Future Past Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-x-men-days-future-past-20140522,0,372558.column",200,x-mendaysoffuturepast41,x-mendaysoffuturepast,chicagotribune

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert When last we visited the X-Men Marvels mutant franchise was finding its bearings after a couple of bad-to-wobbly entries. Begun in confident fashion the story of the shunned superhero subculture veered astray before righting itself with the retro prequel ""X-Men First Class."" That 1960s-set prologue featured fresh energetic talents playing youthful versions of established characters. The Bond-inspired rouser gave us James McAvoy subbing for Patrick Stewart as benign telepath Professor X Jennifer Lawrence replacing Rebecca Romijn as blue-skinned shape-shifter Mystique and an appropriately magnetic Michael Fassbender stepping in for Ian McKellens destructive Magneto. Now comes another blast from the past. ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" is a sequel to the prequel that unites the new and original casts in a time-traveling extravaganza. It ranks as one of the best. Director Bryan Singer who originated the series in 2000 returns to the helm building on the rejuvenated energy of the previous installment while pushing the scenario to ambitious new extremes. The story begins in doom-laden end times. Invincible robots patrol a dead future Earth about to exterminate the final few gifted mutants. Weary Professor X (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) are trapped in a deserted Chinese monastery with Hugh Jackmans bellicose brawler Wolverine and a few others. The only way to prevent the mechanoid killers from completing their mission is to send Wolverine back through time to stop the war before it begins. Well yeah it sounds easy. But following the events of the previous film young Professor X is a powerless drug-addicted recluse. Magneto at this point his mortal enemy is in an impenetrable lockup for a political assassination. Mystique has gone rogue on a vendetta of vengeance. And the character who must bring them together is the least diplomatic personality in the Marvel universe. Thats a lot of plates to keep spinning but Singer who made his breakthrough with the similarly tricky ""The Usual Suspects"" never falters. Theres a sense of genuine peril in the dystopian future scenes and breathless action beats that elevate Lawrence from eye candy to game changer. Theres a canny grasp of Watergate-era Washington chicanery in the 1973 scenes and the films humor never descends to broad satire. Waterbeds Pong boss-looking muscle cars and ""Star Trek"" all get affectionate nods. Pre-PC technology not so much. Fox Mct - Mct Jennifer Lawrence stars in ""X-Men Days of Future past."" The film is visually exciting aping the look of period camerawork effectively in several 1970s scenes. The actors arent overwhelmed by effects for the most part. The troubled profane McAvoy is outstanding especially in a sequence when his older and younger selves have a meeting of the minds. Theres so much going on in this rich story that some of the excellent cast is underused. Id have liked to see more from McKellen and Peter Dinklage as the technocrat lobbying Congress to fund his mutant-killer machines. Im thrilled however that the film found the time to introduce a terrific new mutant character. Evan Peters makes a grand entrance as super-swift teen Quicksilver whos crucial to breaking Magneto out of prison. A smug nuisance well on his way to juvenile delinquency hes part Road Runner part wiseguy Bugs Bunny. Running rings around the guards he flicks away their bullets swipes their hats and gives one a world-class wedgie. Like Hulk in ""The Avengers"" hes the movies breakout surprise. Lets hope this speed demon is part of the team working on the next sequel.

In the interim through seven films weve been treated to sequels prequels sidequels and requels. Whether youre a rabid comic-book collector or a casual fan of mutant mayhem thats a lot to wrap your skull around. Singers return in the pretzel-logic pop fantasia X-Men Days of Future Past is so triumphant because of how effortless he makes connecting the dots seem. Its an epic that couldnt be more Byzantine on paper but scans with ease on screen. Ever since Singer left the fold after 2003s excellent X-Men 2 to direct Superman Returns things have been pretty hit-and-miss. Brett Ratners X-Men The Last Stand was a dud and both Wolverine spin-offs despite Hugh Jackmans gruff mutton-chopped charisma were underwhelming. Only Matthew Vaughns X-Men First Class duplicated Singers cocktail of gravitas and merry-prankster fun. First Class introduced new actors in familiar roles namely James McAvoy as the young Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr (a.k.a. Magneto) and the fizzy dynamic between these characters felt so fresh and emotionally resonant that it seemed inevitable the audience would demand to see the powerhouse actors in those roles again. Not surprisingly the best thing about Days of Future Past is that its heavier on the days past than future. In that sense its a lot like 1994s Star Trek Generations where even the most fervent fans of the USS Enterprise were waiting for William Shatners Kirk to bite the dust and pass the phaser to the Next Gen posse. The Star Trek parallel isnt an idle one. In Singers new film one of the key themes is traveling back in time to change the course of the present. Its a movie about violating the Prime Directive. The nerdy irony is that its Picard himself Patrick Stewart whose Xavier is most gung ho about rewriting history. The film opens in a bleak future that finds the mutants and their human sympathizers cordoned off in an eerily glowing Central Park detention camp. The mutants who have managed to survive a xenophobic government (and their numbers are rapidly dwindling) are on the run from the Sentinels a robot race of exterminators gunning to wipe out the freaks for good. Stewarts Xavier and his longtime frenemy Magneto (Ian McKellen) have sought refuge at a Chinese monastery where several other mutants are hiding out. Cue Blink Sunspot and Iceman (but dont get too attached; they mostly pop up during the films Sentinel-fueled bookends). Theres also Ellen Pages Kitty Pryde. Thanks to her ability to transport a persons consciousness through time she helps execute Xaviers scheme to zap Wolverine back to the pivotal moment in 1973 when Jennifer Lawrences blue-skinned shape-shifter Raven/Mystique assassinated the Sentinels mastermind Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). If Wolverine can prevent the murder then the Sentinel program might be aborted. Or so Xavier hopes. I know all of this sounds like a tangled thicket of cosmically Big Ideas. But Simon Kinbergs marvelous script makes it all move with a Swiss jewelers precision and hum with internal logic. Its complex without being confusing. When Wolverine wakes up in a waterbed next to a lava lamp as Roberta Flack plays on the radio and President Nixon attempts to bring an end to the Vietnam War the film takes on a giddy time-warp thrill. Wolverine has to persuade the reluctant Xavier and Lehnsherr to team up for the common good -- no easy feat considering Magneto is in a high-security prison cell 100 floors below the Pentagon. So Wolverine enlists a new mutant to the celluloid series Evan Peters Quicksilver whose brief turn as the ultimate jailbreaker is the highlight of the film. Its also proof that Singer really gets what makes these movies such smart -- and smart-ass -- fun. The central conflict in Days of Future Past is between the young Xavier and Lehnsherr. Can they trust each other? Who has the stronger hold on Mystique? And once again McAvoy and Fassbender prove that just because a movie is huge doesnt mean you have to ham it up -- that its possible to make a superhero flick feel as intimate as a piece of theater. I do wish that Dinklages Trask had more layers to his villainy and Lawrence had more to do. But these are minor complaints. The main one for fans of the comics I think will be that with so much ground to cover certain mutants get shortchanged. But you cant have it all. Plus theres always the next sequel.

That he can look leading-man cool in silly headgear? First it was Frank Sidebottoms grinning papier mache mug in Frank. Now hes back in Magnetos Samp;M-meets-Viking helmet for Bryan Singers time-hopping new instalment of Marvels X-Men series - a bouncy and fun but brain-achingly confusing blockbuster. Seriously if you dont know your X-Men dont make this your starter film. Or at least take a geek to whisper the backstory as you watch. Singer doesnt hang about. He kicks things off in the apocalyptic future with humanity under attack from giant man-made robots called Sentinels - invented by brainiac scientist Bolivar Trask (nice work from Peter Dinklage playing it straight rather than all scheming Dr Evil). Its the end of the world as we know it. So Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) patch up their differences and dispatch Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to the 1970s to throw a claw in Dr Trasks masterplan. Most of the action takes place in the 1970s where Logan has never looked more at home - in the thick of all those sideburns and bare man-chests. The Vietnam War is over and mutants are soon to become Public Enemy Number One. Logan finds the young prof Xavier (James McAvoy) drunk. Meanwhile naughty Magneto (Fassbender) is in maximum-security lock-up again. Theres a brilliantly inventive set-piece as the gang busts him free cocky teenage mutant Quicksilver (Evan Peters a keeper) whose superpower is lightning speed outfoxes the military police. Time appears to crawl to a standstill around him glass shattering in a slow-motion ballet as he changes the direction of bullets. It all trots along at a brisk pace with genuinely impressive special effects and decent gags. Bryan Singer really cares about his mutant outcasts weaving just enough drama into the superhero shenanigans. When youre asking actors to spout nonsense quantum physics while dressed like backing dancers at a gay club it helps if theyre an A-team cast of heavyweights like this. Best of all is shape-shifting assassin Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) slipping from her snakey-blue skin into any form she chooses - a one-woman mutant army. Its through her character radicalised by the human attacks on mutants that Singer explores his theme of mutants as a metaphor for minorities. Just dont expect to have a clue whats going on. You wont need to by the end anyway - at which point Singer wipes the slate clean for the X-Men films of the future. Talking of which dont leave before the credits have run if you want a taste of whats coming next.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW X-Men Days of Future Past Running time 131 minute. Rated PG-13 (superhero violence). Bryan Singers whip-smart and witty time-travel romp ""X-Men Days of Future Past blows a breath of fresh air through the musty Marvel universe which increasingly is all about pandering to hard-core fans rather than trying to make good movies for everybody. Returning to the franchise he launched 14 years ago for Fox Singer sure-handedly offers up a soaring adventure thats far more dramatically and thematically potent than the increasingly formulaic movies Marvel has been churning out on its own since being acquired by Disney. Ian McKellan (left) and Patrick Stewart reprise their roles as Magneto and Professor X respectively in ""X-Men Days of Future Past.""Photo Twentieth Century Fox It doesnt hurt that this film brings together his three original stars -- Patrick Stewart Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman -- with the younger equally formidable ensemble leaders in Matthew Vaughns ""X-Men First Cast from 2011 James McAvoy Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence. Thats quite an acting lineup and Singer gives them all a chance to shine in Simon Kinbergs clever adaptation of a 1981 comic book set in a dystopian future where mutants are being hunted down and killed by giant robots. Former adversaries Professor X (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) are reunited in old age hiding out in a castle in China. Theyre barely able to keep one step ahead of their pursuers because Kitty Pryde (an excellent Ellen Page) can send Bishop (Omar Sy) back in time for two days to spy on them. The only hope for the mutants is a much longer trip into the past -- back to 1973 when Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) assassinated the inventor of the robots (Peter Dinklage very good) -- who is allied with the young Stryker (Josh Helman) -- at the Paris peace talks for the Vietnam War. She was captured and vivisected by the inventors colleagues and her shape-shifting abilities were incorporated into the robots to lethal effect. Only the hot-tempered and fast-healing Wolverine (Jackman) is hardy enough to make it to the past -- where hes awakened in a Times Square hotel by the strains of Roberta Flack singing ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face. Wolverine of course is probably least qualified of the mutant proteges to persuade the younger Professor X (McAvoy) -- whos been hitting the bottle after giving up his powers for a chance to walk again -- to put aside his differences with 1973 Magneto (Fassbender) to stop Raven/Mystique. Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine.Photo Twentieth Century Fox Of course any attempt to change the past -- especially one with lava lamps -- can have all sorts of unforeseen consequences. Its a very complicated plot that Singer delineates with admirable clarity while juggling a vast array of other mutants -- some with larger roles (Nicholas Hoults Beast Shawn Ashmores Iceman) and others who are barely glimpsed (Halle Berrys Storm Anna Paquins Rogue). Jennifer Lawrence is back as blue beauty Mystique.Photo Twentieth Century Fox Most notable is newcomer Evan Peters who nearly steals the film as the fast-moving Quicksilver whose extraction of Magneto from high-security captivity in a sub-basement of the Pentagon combines visionary action and slapstick comedy in a brilliant sequence. There are many reasons to like ""X-Men Days of Future Past including working in Presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon (a very funny Mark Camacho) as well as Singers refreshing willingness to disregard strict fidelity to the source material. This is a superhero movie for those who dont like superhero movies -- as well as those who do.

No skyscrapers blow up no cities are leveled and while the White House and a football stadium suffer some serious structural damage the wholesale destruction of human civilization is kept to a refreshing minimum in ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" -- just one of several respects in which this strikingly ambitious yet intimately scaled entertainment distinguishes itself from so much of its comicbook-movie kind. Back at the helm of the Fox/Marvel franchise he successfully launched 14 years ago director Bryan Singer stages a stealth reboot by introducing a playful time-travel element to the ongoing saga bringing two generations of mutantkind together in a story that toggles cleverly (if not always 100% coherently) between the political tumult of 1973 and a not-so-distant dystopian future. Singers scandalous recent headlines are unlikely to impact the commercial fortunes of this keenly anticipated tentpole attraction whose B.O. haul stands to rival and perhaps exceed that of the series top earner to date ""X-Men The Last Stand."" Its 459 million worldwide gross notwithstanding that 2006 smash marked the beginning of a severe lapse in quality for the franchise as Singer having directed the excellent first two pictures left the third one in the singularly ill-suited hands of Brett Ratner. (""The Last Stand"" was followed but not much improved upon by Gavin Hoods ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" in 2009.) Fortunately the overall series has been on the creative upswing in recent years buoyed by Matthew Vaughns terrific prequel ""X-Men First Class"" (2011) and James Mangolds unexpectedly fine ""The Wolverine"" (2013). And given that Singers own career hasnt exactly flourished in the meantime with ""Superman Returns"" ""Valkyrie"" and last years bomb ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" its not especially surprising to see him make his long-overdue return to blockbuster form here Not since 2003s ""X2 X-Men United"" has this filmmaker tapped so effortlessly into his talent for comicbook gravitas his ability to mine emotional resonance pop poetry and (crucially) sly humor from material that could otherwise have veered into strained seriousness or high camp. Just as the first ""X-Men"" opened with a flashback to the Holocaust so the new film commences with a grim evocation of death and warfare this time set in a fictitious future. A government army of killer robots known as Sentinels has almost succeeded in wiping out all mutants and their human supporters leaving Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his longtime friend/nemesis Erik Lensher/Magneto (Ian McKellen) to seek refuge with their few remaining allies in a remote Chinese safe house. Their last hope is Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) whose powers include the curious ability to transport a persons consciousness through time Professor X and Magneto propose that she send Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to the year 1973 in order to undo certain key events and thereby erase the Sentinel program from history. (With his superhuman powers of bodily regeneration Logan is the only one who could withstand such a journey -- a handy justification for keeping the series defining character front and center.) Hurled back to the heyday of lava lamps and waterbeds Richard Nixon and Alice Cooper Logan must convince the younger hipper version of Charles (James McAvoy) that a dark future awaits if they dont act immediately. This turns out to be easier said than done. The 60s were an especially rough decade for Charles leaving him a mental and emotional wreck His school for young mutants has been abandoned (only Hank McCoy/Beast played once again by Nicholas Hoult has stuck around) and hes addicted to a serum that restores his ability to walk yet stifles his telepathic powers -- which is to say his gift for empathy. Still Logan proves sufficiently persuasive and Charles reluctantly agrees to help him infiltrate the Pentagon and free Erik (Michael Fassbender) from the subterranean prison where hes being held for past crimes. Its a dangerous but necessary step thats pulled off with smashing aplomb by Logans old pal Peter (Evan Peters) a leather-jacketed silver-haired mutant known as Quicksilver for his incredible agility and one of the few Marvel crossover characters who can claim membership with the X-Men and the Avengers. While Aaron Taylor-Johnson is playing the character in Disneys concurrent Marvel franchise (hell be seen at length in 2015s ""Avengers Age of Ultron"") the bar has been set remarkably high here Peters Quicksilver steals every scene hes in especially one brilliant deliriously fun action sequence that reveals how everything seems to advance in slow-motion from his perspective. In order to stop the Sentinels devised by the mutant-mutilating Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage) the latest in a long line of ""X-Men"" villains creepily modeled on Mengele the uneasily aligned Charles Erik and Logan must first head to France where the Paris Peace Accords are about to take place. Their goal is to track down the renegade shape-shifter Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who doesnt realize that her plot to assassinate Trask will only accelerate the governments mutant-extinction program. ""We can show them a better path"" Charles intones more than once cutting to the moral and thematic core of a series that has always expressed its solidarity with the oppressed and misunderstood predicated on the sincere notion that the honorable deeds of an embattled few can indeed alter the hearts minds and fortunes of many. Working from Simon Kinbergs screenplay (very loosely adapted from an ""X-Men"" comicbook storyline by Chris Claremont and John Byrne) Singer unspools these intricate developments in a smooth carefully controlled style that while hardly skimping on expertly choreographed action and lavish f/x spectacle puts a gratifying premium on psychological depth and delineation of character The story effectively becomes a platonic triangle with Professor X and Magneto (who as always has his own surprising agenda) waging war for Mystiques soul. Nearly all the moral conflicts at play -- will Mystique abandon her murderous agenda? Can Charles overcome his crippling anguish and fight the good fight? -- are resolved in fairly foreseeable fashion dovetailing neatly with the tales overarching themes of individual and collective redemption. But if the characters quandaries at times feel overly circumscribed theyre also advanced with a bracing emotional directness devoid of either cynicism or sentimentalism that touches genuine chords of feeling over the course of the films fleet 130-minute running time. While not as brassy in its period stylization as Vaughns 60s-set ""X-Men First Class"" ""Days of Future Past"" embraces its specific historical moment with similar revisionist gusto from an early subplot that sends Mystique off to Saigon to rescue a squad of mutants from Trasks clutches to a borderline-tacky plot point concerning Magnetos suspected role in the JFK assassination. Given the popular Hollywood practice of depicting real-life U.S. presidents as obliquely as possible (""Lee Daniels The Butler"" notwithstanding) its refreshing to see an actor (Canadian thesp Mark Camacho) actually dare to inhabit the voice and visage of Nixon and inhabit them well in a movie that uses the former POTUS post-Vietnam flop sweat to smart narrative advantage. Stylistically the decision to give certain public moments the grainy bright-colored look of 70s newsreels adds a touch of verite immediacy although the Super 8 and 16mm footage looks rather odd in 3D (much of the film was shot stereoscopically and makes fine if not exceptional use of the format.) As they did in ""First Class"" McAvoy and Fassbender make an electrifying duo here doing full justice to the emotionally complicated swirl of love anger kinship and betrayal that binds Charles and Erik and rendering the kinder gentler interplay between Stewart and McKellen all the more poignant by comparison. In a picture grounded by a number of richly involving two-character dialogue exchanges one of the most moving sequences finds Charles older and younger selves mysteriously communicating across the space-time continuum. While Lawrence looks fetching enough in Mystiques blue birthday suit the actress registers with less impact than one might have hoped; coming off her explosively entertaining turn in the much more elaborate Me Decade re-creation of ""American Hustle"" she has relatively little to do here other than glower snarl and let the f/x artists do their thing (though its fun to hear her speaking Vietnamese at one point). With Wolverine playing the unusual role of mediator this time around Jackman is in unusually restrained cool-headed form; the actors slightly disoriented appearance throughout is entirely appropriate to the characters journey and may well be shared by a few fans in the later reels when the storys time-travel logic gets especially raggedy. By the end however its clear that the ""X-Men"" series has effectively opened a temporal loophole that should lead to fresh adventures down the road -- namely ""X-Men Apocalypse"" which is set to be released in 2016 although its unclear whether the embattled Singer will return to the directors chair. The films intense focus on its four leads -- plus the excellent Dinklage easily beating out McAvoy for most conspicuously 70s hair -- leaves little room for the rest of the ensemble with its surfeit of new and familiar faces. For all the ways in which the material fits Singer like a glove the filmmaker still hasnt figured out a way to make Halle Berrys Storm a compelling presence; Shawn Ashmores Iceman pops up in welcome but somewhat truncated fashion; and its a mystery why Anna Paquin retains such prominent billing given Rogues blink-and-you-miss-it appearance. Speaking of Blink the mutant who goes by that name is one of the more memorable ""X-Men"" newcomers due more to her nifty powers of teleportation than to Chinese star Fan Bingbings muted performance. Other fresh additions to the mutant ranks who register briefly here include Bishop (Omar Sy) Sunspot (Adan Canto) and Warpath (Booboo Stewart). Costume designer Louise Mingenbach has fun outfitting roughly half the cast in an array of period duds without going overboard. Like many of Singers prior pics the production benefits from the dual contributions of versatile editor-composer John Ottman -- particularly evident in the storys clean pacing and construction despite some busy cross-cutting in the action-heavy final stretch.

Because kitty prydes powers never happen upon the telepathic/time travel ability nor would they ever. Why didnt they just use a machine and send her back too?? there was a signifcant reason to send her back in the comics and have her work with magneto. Not to mention how stupidly underused storm has been and the whole mess up of mystiques power set. her ability is to shift in physical ways not take on different powers. a sentinel wouldnt get that from her blood but would have from say.. copycat?? wtf. this movie sucked. Reply John Tait (IsleFreeThinker) says May 24 2014 at 925 pm I viewed X-Men DOFP this afternoon and was surprised how quickly the time passed. Thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. The 3D wasnt overdone but was done very well. Storyline was excellent; acting top notch. I dont go to the theatre that often but Im glad I did for this. Great afternoon Reply PhilG says May 27 2014 at 140 pm Quicksilver is one of the ""few"" who bridges the X-Men and Avengers...? Presumably thats meant to be ""one of the few Fox and Disney/Marvel could agree to share"" given that Wolverine is the most prominent person with a foot in both camps.. Personally I hope the ending allows for an Apocalypse/Post-Apocalypse() film starring the ORIGINAL cast rather than another necessarily-period piece. Or parallel projects a Mystique spin-off (since Fox is supposedly keen); a real X-Men sequel and a First Class sequel. And a Quicksilver TV series (even if it would wind up being against The Flash... having a hero speedster vying with a putative villain with similar powers for ratings would be interesting. Two sides of the coin).. Reply Henk van Ess (henkvaness) says May 22 2014 at 912 am After seeing Godzilla yesterday I hesitated to see the world demolished once more in glorious 3D and with DTS 12-Track Digital Sound. But to my surprise no planets were hurt in making this movie. I did not encounter awkward moments where the villain or even the hero sais ""I will destroy you. I must save the world"" Its almost an intimate film at least in this genre. Young Xavier played excellent denying the fact that he IS a comic character. Good escapism even for intellectuals. Reply Tim says May 20 2014 at 1130 am I saw the movie last Night. Its a great movie. Good acting good pace good story... Its always a shame when the credits start. Cant wait for the next one. Fassbender McAvoy and Jackman are just fantastic. Enjoy the movie. Singer still is a fantastic director and storyteller. Reply Becks says May 13 2014 at 624 pm Can anyone confirm that no children where anally-raped in the filming of this project? Need to know for sure. Reply Muhammad Islam says May 13 2014 at 941 am Man Im getting pumped for this movie now Reply Travis says May 13 2014 at 233 am Hey Give Me A Break X2 is a great film in the eyes of most and its social commentary isnt really ""lite"" its just not used to beat you over the head either. However movies are a subjective form. What Ive just said is how I experience it what you said is only how YOU experience it. So when in the process of bashing this film that most people either like or love you act like you can tell us what it is ""in truth"" you just make yourself seem like a contrarian narcissist. You dont know THE truth about this or any film because there isnt one. You only know YOUR truth about it. Have a nice day. Reply Gobias Bluth says May 13 2014 at 446 am You do know that this dude is just doing his job right? Reply Mikael. says May 13 2014 at 653 am Pretty sure he was talking to the guy who uh.. was called Give Me a Break. The critique above was mostly if not completely in a positive light. John Wheeler says May 13 2014 at 230 am The latest in this sector of Marvels comic-book empire is a film of two halves. It takes place in two different eras which means two different teams of superheroes battling to save humanity in their own ways. These superheroes might be able to transcend the laws of nature but the logic of the franchise proves to be immutable even if it means spoiling the audiences fun. Reply Give Me a Break says May 12 2014 at 704 pm You sure are reaching with your assessment of X2 when in truth its nothing more than a popcorn flick thats candy coated with its lite-social commentary. Reply Joe (WTTSP) says May 12 2014 at 640 pm These comments suck. Glad to hear the movie is good. Cant wait to see it. Reply Jack Scoggins says May 12 2014 at 625 pm Anna Paquin is an Oscar winner and her role was originally written to be more substantial than what ended up in the final cut. Her billing was determined by her contract which was signed long before the movie was shot and edited. Reply Stephen S. says May 12 2014 at 444 pm In America you are innocent until you are PROVEN guilty. We dont know right now if he guilty or innocent. Besides you have to be able to separate the art from the artist. Reply Luluinhollywood says May 13 2014 at 154 pm Oh PLEASE. Its pathetic that you would compare the two to make an argument. It just makes you sound biased amp; stupid. Singer is only ACCUSED of a crime. In civil NOT criminal court. He has not even been arrested let alone charged. LET ALONE CONVICTED. He is being sued. HITLER orchestrated the murder of millions of people. Get a life. Reply cadavra says May 12 2014 at 430 pm Lets hope they do a better job of re-creating 1973 than FIRST CLASS did of 1962-which is to say not at all. Reply therealeverton says May 12 2014 at 359 pm Good news... Reply Bob Nunnally says May 12 2014 at 354 pm Blah blah blah... stick to the review. Glad you liked it but your review is chocked full of the kind of unnecessary fat even you hate.

TWITTER Original franchise stars Hugh Jackman Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart join reboot recruits Jennifer Lawrence James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender in this latest foray into the iconic Marvel Comics universe. Matthew Vaughn and a superb cast reinvigorated the franchise with cool retro style and globetrotting intrigue in 2011s X-Men First Class. The series original director Bryan Singer continues that momentum in the vigorously entertaining X-Men Days of Future Past. While its more dramatically diffuse than the reboot and lacks a definitive villain the new film is shot through with a stirring reverence for the Marvel Comics characters and their universe. And it ups the stakes by threatening nothing less than the genocide of the mutant population among them faces old and new. Huge worldwide box office seems guaranteed. Since its first screen appearance 14 years ago this exciting series has been driven by the theme of ostracized outsiders empowered to fight against their social stigma in ways both good and evil. That vein remains front and center here with the mutants humanity amplified by their extreme physical vulnerability. Hardcore followers will have a geek field day dissecting the challenging pretzel logic of writer-producer Simon Kinbergs screenplay from a story by Jane Goldman Kinberg and Vaughn who had originally planned to direct. The central premise comes from the 1981 Uncanny X-Men comic Days of Future Past in which Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) uses her consciousness transference powers to go back from a dystopian future and rewrite history. PHOTOS X-Men Days of Future Past Premiere Jennifer Lawrence Hugh Jackman Hit Black Carpet In dumbed-down pop-cultural terms that functions like the dream of Bobby Ewings death in Dallas. While its a far less outrageous plot gambit it calls into question many events from the original three movies - specifically 2006s X-Men The Last Stand - providing a blanket license to erase continuity lapses among the films and usher in fresh developments moving forward. The screenplay ponders whether time is immutable while raising the possibility of infinite outcomes. But spend too long trying to align what happens here with earlier developments and your head will explode. Echoes of the Holocaust have rippled throughout the series and Singer opens with present-day scenes of a desolate burnt-out New York where mutants and mutant-sympathizing humans have been rounded up in internment camps. Jumping to a similarly devastated Moscow we watch Kitty Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and a small band of mutants face an attack from the deadly Sentinels. Dropped in from airborne carrier ships these robots are designed to track and destroy the mutant gene. They resemble towering muscular versions of the aliens from Close Encounters of the Third Kind constructed out of magnetic plates that allow them to change shape and adapt to whatever force is unleashed against them. STORY X-Mens Ellen Page on Life After Coming Out the Bryan Singer Case and Her Battle With Depression The mutants escape and regroup in the rubble of an ancient Chinese monastery with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) Magneto (Ian McKellen) Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry). The movie is missing an explanation of how traditional adversaries Professor X and Magneto reached a collaborative truce. But within the elastic boundaries of comic-book mythology that seems no big deal and its nice to see their bromance rekindled. Threatened with extinction the mutant holdouts hatch a plan to return to the post-Vietnam Paris Peace Accord of 1973 when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) killed Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) a U.S. military scientist developing the Sentinels program. Mystique was captured and experimented on with the transformative powers of her DNA tapped to perfect the Sentinels. Wolverines ability to heal makes him the only one able to withstand the 40-year time jump. Kinbergs script milks welcome humor out of sending the least diplomatic of the X-Men back to convince the younger Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to join forces and stop the assassination that triggered anti-mutant hysteria. Having Wolverine awaken on a waterbed staring at a lava lamp and listening to Roberta Flack lightens the mood at just the right moment. STORY X-Men Days of Future Past Premiere Jennifer Lawrence on Mystiques Undetermined Future"" James McAvoy on a Different Xavier Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and production designer John Myhre provide marked contrasts between the two periods - brooding darkness in the present; a softer more naturalistic look in the past - that helps as the action progresses and cross-cutting increases. In the same way the 1960s Cold War setting gave a distinctive vibe to Vaughns franchise entry this one offers maximum enjoyment in the extended central action that unfolds roughly a decade later. Its also where the series refreshing emphasis on character is strongest. Looking Christ-like with his 70s mop and scruffy beard McAvoys Charles Xavier couldnt be less like that of Stewart with his steely but benevolent authority. Disillusioned Charles is addicted to a serum produced by Beast (Nicholas Hoult) that gives him the use of his legs but strips him of his telepathic powers. Professor X is the one character whose younger and older selves actually meet in a scene that is among the movies most emotionally resonant. There are also affecting moments when Wolverine encounters Major Bill Stryker (Josh Helman) triggering traumatic flash-forward memories of his painful physical transformation and his love for Jean Grey. But the midsection includes thrilling action set pieces too. One involves the chaos that ensues when the X-Men thwart Mystiques initial attempt to kill Trask spilling from an official building out into the crowded square below. Just as connections to the Cuban missile crisis enlivened First Class historical references to the Nixon era add dramatic traction here not to mention mutant links - both grim and amusing - to JFKs assassination. Singer flips back and forth during the Paris clash between widescreen format and footage from bystanders home movies that evoke the Zapruder film. Perhaps the films standout sequence features the much-discussed new addition of Peter Maximoff aka Quicksilver (American Horror Story regular Evan Peters). The rights dispute that kept the character out of previous films has been resolved allowing him to appear in both the X-Men and Avengers franchises albeit without cross-referencing. His super-speed skills are conveyed by shooting at 3000 frames per second notably when Peter runs around the walls during a fabulously staged Pentagon break-in whimsically accompanied by Jim Croce singing ""Time in a Bottle."" With his silver shag Pink Floyd T-shirt and mischievous sense of humor Peter is a terrific character who breathes playfulness into the movie and many will be sorry he doesnt stick around longer. Other new recruits are more limited in scope like portal-punching Blink played by Chinese beauty Fan Bingbing who has virtually no dialogue but is nonetheless a vivid presence. Among the returnees from the series origins Berrys Storm sticks to the sidelines until kicking up a tempest during the climactic action sequence and as has been reported scenes involving Anna Paquins Rogue were cut for pacing reasons reducing her appearance to a cameo. Other unbilled stars of the pre-reboot X-Men pop up briefly. Fassbenders young Erik/Magneto was the revelation of First Class and the actor again shows riveting self-possession and charisma to burn - not least when hes standing astride the roof of a moving train in bellbottoms while tearing up railway tracks. But this movie belongs to Jackman and Lawrence. Logan/Wolverine has possibly never been more compelling. In his seventh turn in the role Jackman brings powerful physicality laconic humor and depths of sorrow beneath his gruffness that make him an unusually nuanced figure for a sci-fi action movie. Switching from her honorable Hunger Games heroine into badass mode with supreme ease Lawrence is sensational whether slinking around in Mystiques body-hugging blue reptilian skin displaying the shape-shifters balletic fight skills or adopting seductive human form. Her romantic friendship with Charles stretching back to their childhoods adds poignancy to Mystiques struggle notably in a wonderful airport scene during which Professor X gets inside her head via random people in the terminal. As the nominal villain the always excellent Dinklage brings gravitas but the characters ambiguous morality makes him a less commanding nemesis for the mutants than Kevin Bacons Nazi war criminal in First Class. Trask also gets somewhat overshadowed by the relentless robotic weapons of destruction he created. Visual effects and CGI work unsurprisingly are top-notch throughout and the Sentinels attacks are rendered with a chilling visceral charge. The classy use of 3D is a model of restraint yielding visual rewards particularly with Magnetos handiwork. Editor John Ottman keeps the pace satisfying but never rushed. Doubling as composer he supplies a score that ranges over many distinct moods giving a winking nod to fat blaxploitation beats during the initial shift to the 70s. Its hard to imagine fanboys having too much to grumble about here as Singer has pulled together an ambitious suspenseful screen chapter that secures a future for the franchise while facilitating continued reinvention. Audiences should sit tight through the end credits crawl for an enigmatic signoff scene that provides a taste of the next installment X-Men Apocalypse.

Do some light streaming dig out the DVD box sets browse the Wikipedia pages or consult the cashier at your neighborhood comic store but make sure you come into the theater with a fairly confident grasp of what went down in ""X-Men"" ""X2"" ""X-Men The Last Stand"" and ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" -- ""The Wolverine"" oddly not so much -- since the screenplay by Simon Kinberg (""Sherlock Holmes"") assumes you already know mutant chapter and verse. See video X-Men Days of Future Past Final Trailer Reunites Wolverine Xavier and Magneto Theres a healthy amount of exposition to walk you through all of this admittedly but given that the story also involves multiple time streams and alternate futures its best not to stop and ask too many questions; here be dragons. Bryan Singer thankfully is back in the directors chair for the first time since ""X2"" (still the gold standard of this franchise) and he keeps things moving along briskly enough that you can just go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down in the labyrinthine plotting if you dont want to. ""Days of Future Past"" opens in a terrifying dystopian future where cities are in ruins and the streets are littered with corpses. (One of the first shots we see is of a bulldozer dropping dozens of human bodies into a mass grave just in case you were planning on bringing any very young children.) The devastation is the result of a years-long war between the mutants (and their human allies) and the Sentinels near-indestructible robots created by Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) now fighting together against the Sentinel threat with Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) meet up with a crew of X-Men -- including Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) Bishop (Omar Sy) Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) Blink (Fan Bingbing) Sunspot (Adam Canto) and Warpath (Booboo Stewart) -- who have remained alive only because Kitty can send Bishop back in time a few days to warn them of the impending attack. Also read Hugh Jackman 99.9 Percent Sure Wolverine Sequel Will Be His Last X-Men Movie Exhausted and near defeat the only hope for the remaining X-Men to defeat the Sentinels is to go back to 1973 and stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing Trask at the Paris Peace Accords; that murder not only cemented the humans anti-mutant sentiment it also allowed her to be captured and having her shape-shifting DNA incorporated into the Sentinels themselves. Before you can ask ""Wait what about those earlier movies where Mystique was played by Rebecca Romijn?"" its decided that Wolverine is the only one who could physically withstand being sent that far backward in time. To stop Mystique hell have to rally the younger incarncations of Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) which is no easy feat -- a drunken self-pitying Professor X is taking an experimental serum from Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) that gives him the use of his legs but suppresses his mental powers while Magneto is being held prisoner beneath the Pentagon for the assassination of JFK. (At last a plausible explanation for the ""magic bullet"" theory.) Singer clearly revels in getting to portray the whacka-chicka early 1970s but never goes as far as ""American Hustle"" even though he too gets to put Jennifer Lawrence into some stunning Qiana ensembles. ""Days of Future Past"" occasionally feels the burden of juggling this many characters and timelines and events; fans of the series should know that apart from Wolverine its the ""First Class"" incarnations of the X-Men that get the bulk of the screen time. See video Jennifer Lawrence Kicks Evil Soldier Ass in X-Men Days of Future Past Teaser They even manage to add a few more mutants into the mix; springing Magneto involves the assistance of a teenaged Quicksilver (Evan Peters) whose high-speed shenanigans provide some of the films most exciting moments particularly a slo-mo bullet time sequence thats a great mix of action and comic slapstick. Singer wisely doesnt overload us with gigantic set pieces saving most of his chits for Magnetos grand climactic gesture; Abbie Hoffman would be disappointed that Magneto doesnt levitate the Pentagon but he does the next best thing. While there are fun moments and a continuation of the franchises main idea -- Professor Xs peace love and understanding vs. Magnetos fight the power -- ""Days of Future Past"" ends up feeling more exhausting than exuberant. Also read Bryan Singers Lawyer Claims the X-Men Director Was Not in Hawaii During Alleged Abuse Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel a frequent Singer collaborator helps delineate the sunny mustard-colored early 1970s from the dark bleakness of the films horrifying future but those future segments are such a bummer (and then so quickly shunted to the background) that they throw off the balance. Theres not a lot of time and space for acting here but the cast wisely gets the most out of each brief moment theyre allowed to stop and talk. Josh Helman as the younger version of one of the X-Mens most ferocious enemies is particularly well cast since his smug expression is hissable even when hes just standing in the background. Still this is the best ""X-Men"" movie since Singer went off to other pursuits and it puts enough of a whammy onto the mutant narrative to allow future sequels to veer off in any number of directions. Too bad that in doing so it like ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" often feels more like a set-up for movies to come rather than a satisfying experience in and of itself. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
