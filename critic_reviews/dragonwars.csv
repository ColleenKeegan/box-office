(FREESTYLE RELEASING) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / September 15 2007 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + You dont have to hand the folks behind ""Dragon Wars"" much (the acting directing costumes editing props music etc Theyre all off). But when they decide to sic that giant snake and those prehistoric dino-birds on downtown Los Angeles the movie turns shockingly watchable. Until that sequence there was no evidence that anybody involved with this laughable fantasy knew what he or she was doing.The computer-generated birds breathe fire on people. The helicopters empty round after round on the relentless snake. The snake lunges at cars and slings them 200 feet. The cameras whoosh between skyscrapers and plummet with burning helicopters and dying birds. Its not quite Michael Bay gangbusters. But its exclamatory anyway. The seasoned sci-fi/ action writer and director Shim Hyung-Rae should sell Bay the sequence of the movies boy and girl caressing on a rooftop while bullet casings rain down on them. That is truly special.Nothing else in ""Dragon Wars"" - or ""D-War"" as the films opening titles announce - is as preposterously fun. In the opening minutes a narrator explains that 500 years ago a girl was born who can turn a serpent into a dragon. The first girl a Korean lass in the 16th century has been reincarnated as a dull Southern Californian named Sarah (Amanda Brooks). The snake and some crypto-medieval army are after her; yet as befits some certain pretty Los Angeles girls shes clueless. Her dreams of doom get her institutionalized but a young reporter named Ethan (Jason Behr) - reincarnated himself maybe from the 16th-century Korean Tom Cruise - knows whats up and tries to keep her alive. Beachfront make-outs and mysterious clothes changes ensue.Presumably Shim was going for an adventure with a ""Godzilla"" feel. The arbitrary final sequence - good serpent versus bad - bears this out. But the camp panic and mock seriousness are marred by a woeful lack of professionalism. Meanwhile that action sequence is way too professional for anything ""Godzilla""-esque. And some of the dialogue suggests a John Hughesversion of ""Lord of the Rings"" ""The fate of the world rests on your shoulders"" says wise old Robert Forster to Ethan. ""Deny this. And you will deny yourself everything. Even the girl."" Aww. Cue the Psychedelic Furs.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/movie nation.

After some eight years in planning production and post and just over two years since live-action shooting wrapped South Koreas biggest-budget production by far looks likely to end up the most expensive cult movie on DVD. Bad-mutha Korean serpents trash downtown L.A. in Eng-lish-language monsterfest ""D-War"" a feast of A-grade f/x married to a Z-grade irony-free script. After some eight years in planning production and post and just over two years since live-action shooting wrapped South Koreas biggest-budget production by far (reportedly 70 million) looks likely to end up the most expensive cult movie on DVD. Though often visually entertaining and supe-rior to helmer Shim Hyeung-raes last monster outing (1999s ""Yonggary"" aka ""Reptilian"") pic looks to have an uphill fight in the hardtop arena. Much-delayed movie is now looking at a July local release maybe in a version different from that unspooled in the Berlin mar-ket. A U.S. distrib said to be vital to pics international release strat-egy had yet to be announced as of early February. Writer-director Shim did all the visual effects via his own studio Younggu Art set up after the debacle of ""Yonggary."" Judging by some of the footage sneaked over the years the CGI has been reworked several times to a present level that is perfectly acceptable (and frequently in-your-face impressive) for a pure genre movie. Judging by some of the crater-like plot lacunae pic has also been cut to the bone making ""D-War"" at least an unabashed thrill ride once the vfx really kick in. Early reels criss-crossing be-tween contempo L.A. and Koreas Chosun Dynasty some 500 years ago contain a lot of over-detailed exposition. Most is put in the mouth of antiques dealer Jack (vet Robert Forster) when young kid Ethan Kendrick (Cody Arens) is exposed to something radiating from an old Korean chest in his shop. Jack explains (via flashbacks) that Ethan has been impregnated with the spirit of an ancient war-rior apprentice who once saved his beloved from the massive army of Buraki a bad Imoogi (serpents who want to morph into dragons). Jack gives the kid a powerful pendant and tells him to seek out the modern equivalent of the apprentices beloved recognizable by a red-dragon tattoo on her shoulder. When that young woman reaches 20 says Jack the pair will have the power to reincarnate Imoogi as dragons. And after half a millennium Buraki is due to have another try at harnessing that power. Cut to Ethan as an adult TV news reporter (Jason Behr) at a time when L.A. has been shaken by a mysterious quake -- a signal for Burakis return. Through a series of unlikely coincidences Ethan meets Sarah (Amanda Brooks) who received the spirit of the apprentices beloved at birth and is now feeling distinctly queasy. At the 55-minute mark pic turns into a full-fledged f/x ex-travaganza-cum-chase movie as the ornery 600-foot-long Buraki hunts the pair down in the streets of downtown L.A. and up the sides of its buildings laying waste to most of the area. Dialogue is either strictly functional or Sarah exclaiming ""None of this makes sense"" Perfs are equally func-tional. Its strange that Shim a former comic actor didnt seize the chance to make a more ironic movie -- maybe one playing off Korean-U.S. relations (a la ""The Host"") or simply one with more wit. Instead ""D-War"" seems concerned only with cracking the U.S. and international market on a tech level with the characters and their development an afterthought. Serpents dragons and assorted monsters (especially a sloth-like creature loaded with revolving cannons) are well imagined -- as are Burakis foot soldiers -- though with nods in the direction of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings.""
