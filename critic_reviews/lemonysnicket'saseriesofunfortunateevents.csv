Pic portrays a mood of inevitable mortal gloom in its view of the AIDS epidemic in NYC and seems rooted in a mid-80s to mid-90s ethos that feels dated. The script for ""The Event"" purportedly kicked around for years in development hell before director Thom Fitzgerald came on board and a production deal was finally sealed. To put the best spin on a disappointing end result project -- which portrays a mood of inevitable mortal gloom in its view of the AIDS epidemic in NYC -- was delayed beyond the era of its most urgent relevancy. This middling drama about euthanasia worked out through a sprawl of underdeveloped characters will almost certainly end up as cable offering. People still die from AIDS but pic seems rooted in a mid-80s to mid-90s ethos that feels dated particularly since its earnestly instructive (if wobbly) tenor recalls such then-groundbreaking prestige-cast yet pedestrian telepics on the same theme as ""An Early Frost"" ""And the Band Played On"" and ""Our Sons."" Parker Posey is Nick an investigator for the district attorneys office whos assigned to check out a series of suspect deaths -- AIDS patients who died under similar circumstances immediately following invitation-only parties. DA thinks the patients may have opted for assisted-suicide which illegal by N.Y. state law. First stop for Nicola (aka Nick) is the Chelsea district HIV support clinic presided over by Brian (Brent Carver) who was late cellist Matts (Don McKellar) best friend caregiver and lover. Brian resents the bureaucratic intrusion but Nick pushes forward. Why was Matt cremated so quickly? Did family and friends help him plan out a painless demise? Did he (as well as several other recently deceased patients at the clinic) throw a big farewell bash designed to end with his own drug overdose? Nicks interviews with Matts stereotypically tough-loving Jewish mama (Olympia Dukakis) his argumentative younger actress sister (Sarah Polley) and defensively square-homemaker elder one (Joanna P. Adler) raise more questions than they answer. Meanwhile the investigators ambivalence about this case is exacerbated by suspicion that her own very-Jersey family might harbor a similar death-with-dignity secret. Flashbacks show Matts increasing debilitation and his move back under his moms roof for full-time caregiving. Dramaturgical climax is the Manhattan party at which he says goodbye before retiring to a bedroom for fatal intravenous-drip overdose -- which goes awry enabling pic to yank tear ducts further. Last half-hour piles on far too many such lump-in-throat moments their contrivance amplified by the portrayal of Matts purported closest-friend circle as a very p.c.-movie-ish ""rainbow"" of banal types Despite its grittier surface ""The Event"" comes off as the East Coast equivalent to Randall Kleisers ""Its My Party"" which similarly offered an artificial air-kiss-festival sendoff for a terminal AIDS patients premeditated suicide. Amply talented cast is not seen at its best. Polley and Posey strain for woiking-class-Joisey feel; Carver and McKellar substitute prickliness for fully-dimensional characters; Dukakis is indulged with the kind of conventional but showy role that can lead to an Emmy Award. Perfs dont benefit from pics uncertain tone which wavers between quasi-hardboiled ""black"" comedy and guilt-tripping sentimentality. Thomas M. Hartings HD vid lensing has the past swimming in earth tones and the present in a soft-focus bluish cast; neither is very appealing. Soundtracked retro rock/pop/disco songs and Christophe Becks original score lack appeal as well. Other design and tech aspects are adequate. Local-color exteriors aside pic was primarily shot in Halifax Nova Scotia. ""The Event"" is particularly disappointing in the wake of hit-and-miss Canadian helmer Fitzgeralds (""The Hanging Garden"" ""Beefcake"") as yet little-seen fall Toronto preem the Romania-set-and-shot ""Wild Dogs.""

Comments Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events Like Roald Dahls stories the Lemony Snicket books by Daniel Handler fascinate children by reveling in the morbid. None of them is long enough to sustain a feature however so screenwriter Robert Gordon has combined three titles for this episodic but entertaining fantasy. A grandstanding Jim Carrey plays the vain and greedy Count Olaf who uses a variety of disguises as he tries to steal the inheritance of the three Baudelaire orphans (Liam Aiken Emily Browning and twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman). The young leads play straight to a parade of zany adults (Timothy Spall Catherine OHara Billy Connolly Meryl Streep Luis Guzman Cedric the Entertainer) and the script toys wittily with storytelling conventions.

Nevertheless theres a generation of kids who clearly know all the details of this fictitious(?) authors dark and disturbing Gothic tales. And rather handily I had two with me at the screening. According to the experts the film isnt as good as the first two books its based upon - too many bits are missing - and neither thought much of Jim Carreys Rocky Horror-esque portrayal of the books evil uncle hes just not scary enough and too funny. I thought so too although he surely knows how to strike a funky Gothic pose. Still there are no misgivings about the look of the film its grubby mix of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings-style locations filled with dark mansions rats snakes and lots of backlit silhouettes presents a desirably foreboding atmosphere. The three kid stars too are perfectly cast as the books trio of astute orphans who are left in the care of their scheming uncle Olaf (Carrey) following the horrific death of their parents. The film basically documents the series of unfortunate events that befall these plucky siblings while they go about solving the mystery of their parents demise. Even Meryl Streep Billy Connolly and Dustin Hoffman chip in with a scene or two while Law narrates throughout. Its all a bit superficial but highly entertaining wickedly funny and alluring enough to make you want to start reading the books.

Bats. Two-headed cobras and Tibetan three-eyed toads. A runaway train. A violent hurricane. A count who screams with gleeful wickedness ""You are so deceased"" (then frequently attempts to make good on the promise). And some truly dreadful leeches looking to suck blood. The Baudelaires -- played by from left Kara (or Shelby) Hoffman Emily Browning and Liam Aiken -- and Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) in ""A Series of Unfortunate Events."" (Francois Duhamel -- Paramount Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  Lemony Snicket Showtimes  Watch the Trailer  More Movie Trailers  Holiday Movie Guide  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now These my children are some of the ""unfortunate events"" that befall the poor Baudelaire orphans in the deliciously dark and eccentric world created by Lemony Snicket whose riveting tales now span 11 books worth of misery and misfortune. ""Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events"" plucks its story from the first three volumes and is narrated by the deadpan Snicket who repeatedly cautions his readers -- and now viewers -- that life in the Baudelaires world rarely if ever turns out as one would hope. ""The movie you are about to see is extremely unpleasant"" warns Snicket (Jude Law) at the start. He then ticks off many of the monstrosities to come and recommends a relocation to another theater if perchance you are the sort of person who would prefer ""happy little elf"" tales. Do not take his advice. ""Lemony Snicket"" is a gem of a movie all its adversity and wickedness a backdrop for a story about the remarkable resilience of children who trust in their own knowledge and inventiveness. Perhaps ""no one listens to children"" as they are told in the film and perhaps their world is exceptionally calamitous but the Baudelaires intrepidly toil on nonetheless. Violet (Emily Browning) Klaus (Liam Aiken) and baby Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman) learn of the first ""extremely unfortunate event"" to befall their lives at the start of the film when family banker Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall) informs them that their parents have perished in a fire that burned the family home to the ground. Now orphans the three children are packed up and taken to a dreadfully dirty and dilapidated mansion to live with their distant relative Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) who declares with a flourish ""I will raise these orphans as if they were actually wanted."" What the bizarre and diabolical count truly wants however is the Baudelaire fortune. What follows is a series of daunting and dangerous moments as the children escape Olaf only to find themselves moving from guardian to guardian with the count -- in mad disguise -- stalking them at every turn. Directed by Brad Silberling the film has a Tim Burton-like visual feel which is unsurprising given that the production designer is Rick Heinrichs a frequent Burton collaborator (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" ""Sleepy Hollow""). The visuals are dark and ominous without getting totally terrifying -- the characters feel real but their environment is off-kilter enough to remind you that this world is one of imagination. As Olaf a failed thespian Carrey plays his part with far more comedy and character than the actual count in Daniel Handlers books which is both a good and bad thing. At times he is wickedly amusing; at other moments he becomes a distraction co-opting Olaf into so much of a Jim Carrey vehicle that its impossible not to summon up memories of prior Carrey roles (""The Mask"" ""Ace Ventura"") -- at least for those viewers old enough to have seen him as something other than the Grinch. The children on the other hand seem naturally at home in the Lemony Snicket world. Browning and Aiken consistently wonderful come across as neither too dark nor too earnest; instead they are perfectly like siblings just trying to get through whatever befalls their day. Violet is an ingenious inventor Klaus ferociously well-read; together they use their gifts to extricate themselves from mayhem with spunk and smarts. Baby Sunny whose chief skill is biting is mainly a prop though an amusing one -- since she is unable to speak in anything but gibberish her utterings (translated through subtitles) are used for some laugh-producing one-liners ""Back off parrot face"" (Sunnys reaction to Count Olaf). ""Shes the mayor of crazy town"" She would be Meryl Streep who is terrific as highly neurotic Aunt Josephine who lives in a house perched perilously over the aptly named Lake Lachrymose. Aunt Josephine is fearful of everything radiators the refrigerator doorknobs (which she says could shatter suddenly and put out an eye) even real estate agents. What happens to Aunt Jo we shall not reveal just as we shant say what happens to warmhearted reptile-loving Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) or even to the orphans themselves. Suffice to say that there is much thats unfortunate. Truly enthrallingly unfortunate that is. Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events (108 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for implied violence and well a series of unfortunate events.

Photo by Franois ... more Come closer. Count Olaf wont hurt you. Hell make you laugh. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events Fairy tale/ nightmare. Starring Jim Carrey Emily Browning Liam Aiken Jude Law Meryl Streep. Directed by Brad Silberling. Written by Robert Gordon from three books by Daniel Handler. (PG. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events"" has reached the screen with author Snickets (a.k.a. San Franciscan Daniel Handler ) humor and gloom intact. Much credit for this delightfully morose childrens film must go to director Brad Silberlings careful orchestration. Please note in the vocabulary-building spirit of the Snicket books that the word ""orchestration"" here means ""coaxing good performances out of child actors and keeping Jim Carrey in check."" Carrey finds his perfect role in Count Olaf the scheming guardian trying to remove the orphaned Baudelaire children from a fortune bequeathed by parents who perished in a mysterious fire. Carreys got the bod for the looming Olaf with long dirty fingernails extending a long dirty frame. He ad-libs but never to distraction and generally seems to be having a ball. The wily counts alter egos (""My name is Stefano and I am ... an Italian man"") allow Carrey to stretch without muting his personality as he tends to do in dramatic parts. If Olaf is funnier and less threatening than he is in the Snicket books thats just the price of attaching a big star to a project. In every other way the film based on the first three books and written for the screen by Robert Gordon brings Handlers words to life -- or more precisely to a hyper-real cinematic life enhanced by a buffet of digital effects. The fat gray clouds that follow young inventor Violet (Emily Browning) avid reader Klaus (Liam Aiken) and champion biter Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman) look stagey as do a house teetering on the edge of a cliff and a giant menacing cobra. The word ""stagey"" here means ""in the pleasing manner of a storybook."" Movie versions of childrens books can disappoint youngsters in making concrete what had been left to their imaginations. But the Snicket books lend themselves a little more easily to adaptation because of their timeless quality. Brett Helquists illustrations for the books evoke the 1920s but only vaguely and the film is just as imprecise. The city could be any city the fashions stem from the Victorian era or perhaps the 1940s and Olafs bulky car phone from a time before there were car phones. All we can be sure of is that bad times lie ahead. The narrator Lemony Snicket appears to be living in the 21st century but its hard to tell because hes in silhouette toiling on a manual typewriter. But we recognize the velvet voice and strong profile. Jude Laws appearance in the role suggests that Handler had final say in casting. The word ""casting"" here means ""finding the best-looking man possible to play you in a movie."" The film stays relatively faithful to the books with the notable exception of a subplot involving Olaf and Violet. This bit has been toned down and moved in sequence to make it less creepy. The orphans have landed with Olaf a vain theater actor and stranger because he is their closest relative -- geographically. His house is filthy and he puts the children in peril especially when train tracks are near. His devious plans usually are foiled by Violets ability to invent solutions on the spot via brainpower enhanced by fiddling with her hair ribbon. This emphasis on kids self-reliance has a flip side. ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" like many childrens tales paints most adults as idiots. Two potential Baudelaire guardians played by Billy Connolly and a hilariously neurotic Meryl Streep (her greatest fear? Realtors) make bad decisions and other adults dismiss the kids concerns about Olaf without hearing them out. Young actors Emily and Liam help sell this contrivance by playing Violet and Klaus as smart but also exceedingly polite. The Baudelaires good breeding lets them go only so far in challenging authority figures. Also impressive are the Hoffman twins playing little Sunny who isnt letting her four teeth go to waste. Silberling either has a real way with children or he used special effects in scenes with the tiny actors. Sunnys nonsense baby talk translated into sentences in the books are translated into subtitled sentences here and the kids expressions amazingly seem to match the words. By the time the tot calls someone ""the mayor of crazy town"" however the gimmick has been spent. The word ""spent"" here means ""exhausted to the degree that the film starts to resemble another unfortunate sequel to Look Whos Talking. "" -- Advisory This film contains scary moments and children in danger.

"Artful direction makes Snicket a most fortunate event - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Artful direction makes Snicket a most fortunate event By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  December 17 2004 Lemony Snicket has sold out -- and his movie is better for it.This may not be what fans of A Series of Unfortunate Events"" want to hear but its true The inevitable Hollywood version of author Daniel Handlers poisoned kiddie-book bonbons inevitably lets a little light into the darkest corners of the Baudelaire orphans lives. Theres the occasional sentimental moment a smile or two a conventional mystery plot; theres even -- gasp -- a happy ending. And of course theres Jim Carrey galumphing all over the place braying his merry idiot laugh. What on the page reads as an intermittently inspired pastiche of Charles Addams Edward Gorey and Roald Dahl has been retooled into the latest megaplex bombasto-tainment.Heres the catch The movies good.Director Brad Silberling (Moonlight Mile"") has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain The woeful tale of the Baudelaires their orphaning and subsequent journey from one hapless guardian to the next -- chased all the while by the venal stick-figure Count Olaf (Carrey) -- is sad but not tragic here a story of resourcefulness and fortitude in the face of amusingly grim events narrated by the silhouetted figure of Snicket (Jude Law) with the tact of a first-year undertaker.At the same time Silberlings not a hack like Chris Columbus and Snicket"" has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The films no masterpiece but at least youre in the hands of people who know what theyre doing.So the dire occurrence that opens the books -- the death of the childrens parents in a terrible fire -- is dealt with obliquely the parents never seen the whole thing a fairy-tale intimation of darkness. Were left with the serious inventive Violet (Emily Browning a perfect name for a young actress who seems poised between the Brontes and goth) Klaus (Liam Aiken) of the furrowed brow and many books and infant Sunny (played by twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman) who as readers of the series know bites. Everything. She also speaks in subtitled baby gabble that is generally cruder here than in the books but is still undeniably funny. If theres a problem with this movie its that theres not enough Sunny -- this criticism comes not only from me but from my 7-year-old junior reviewer so it carries weight.The children are taken under the wing of their parents lawyer Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall all muttonchop and Colonel Blimp mumble) who shunts them to their nearest geographical relative Count Olaf. Now comes Carrey; some in the audience sit up expectantly while others duck and cover recalling the comedians elephant-gun approach to the Grinch. But the genius of Snicket"" is to cast Carrey as an actor -- a vain eye-rolling snorting aesthete of the old Edmund Kean school. He lives in a desiccated mansion has a gang of awful actor friends (Jennifer Coolidge Luis Guzman and Jane Adams among them) and is aching to get at the childrens inheritance. Thus the kids find themselves stranded in a locked car on the train tracks the 1215 bearing down fast. Having fun yet? Well yes because how the Baudelaires get out of that fix is clever and engaging and because Silberling cameraman Emmanuel Lubezki and production designer Rick Heinrichs have created a world you cant take your eyes off. Snicket"" unfolds in a tinted alternate universe of gray Gorey-esque skies where cars have reel-to-reel dashboard tape decks and mansions perch perilously on the edge of cliffs. (Look closely at the envelope the children receive in a scene toward the end by the way. The Baudelaires are nearer than you think.)That teetery mansion is where the kids eventually find themselves the wards of Aunt Josephine played by Meryl Streep as a neurasthenic Gibson Girl. Josephines the sort whos afraid the doorknobs might somehow explode -- with good reason it turns out -- and shes susceptible to the wooing of a manly sailor no matter that hes Count Olaf in Popeye disguise. Already weve seen Carrey play a prissy nerd in an effort to get the children away from another foster parent the jolly herpetologist Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) and the repetitiveness of his appearances may start to wear on you and your kids (junior reviewer found him funny but enough already). But by and large Carrey earns his laughs without getting overly splattery.Speaking of kids is this really for them? Not for the youngest obviously but for my money its less traumatic than Polar Express"" or a crass grab bag like Shark Tale."" If the changes made by the filmmakers will tick off purists they honor a medium that craves resolution and (reasonably) happy endings unlike books which can string a good black joke on forever.True the subplot in which Olaf tries to marry the teenage Violet gets into issues the movie has no idea what to do with (this was true of the book too and in fairness it seems to go right over kids heads) and theres one misstep into the seriously scary -- a nighttime attack of carnivorous leeches that had junior reviewer hiding her face in my shoulder. The rest of Snicket"" is a dank clockwork pleasure from its fake-out beginning (as a cheery Claymation film called The Happy Elf"") to the gorgeous paper cut-out credits that will keep you in the theater to the end. (A word of praise too to Thomas Newmans spooky/lovely score.)More to the point the movie like the books flatters childrens innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a 125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals.

A miserable life Jim Carreys disguises and overblown efforts are a hoot. Paramount Director Brad Silberlings film covers the first three of the 11 novels by Daniel Handler aka Snicket. While Snicket is the books narrator the movie occasionally shows Jude Laws Snicket as a shadowy figure typing away. He stops the action interrupts the dialogue and temporarily leads the audience astray. Its a clever device. However the other characters dialogue doesnt always crackle with the wit of the stories which are a hit with kids and their parents. Snicket opens teasingly as a Disney-style ultra-sweet childrens movie but it abruptly changes into a Gothic tale of avarice and deception. The three Baudelaire children are orphaned when their parents perish in a fire and an evil relative they have never met Count Olaf jumps in as their guardian. Hellbent on getting his hands on their fortune Olaf metes out all manner of verbal abuse and villainy. The goings-on often are absurdly funny but theyre also melodramatically grim. The world they inhabit is a melding of Edwardian England with 1950s technology. Its style seemingly is influenced by the films of Tim Burton. (Production designer Rick Heinrichs worked on Burtons Sleepy Hollow.) About the movie Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events   1/ 2 (out of four) Stars Jim Carrey Meryl Streep Liam Aiken Emily Browning Billy Connelly Director Brad Silberling Distributor Paramount Pictures Rated PG for thematic elements scary situations brief language Opens Friday nationwide Jim Carrey as the villainous Olaf looks the part with his beady eyes scraggly unibrow jutting chin and hawk-like nose. His disguises and overblown efforts are a hoot. But when hes being evil he seems more snide than sinister. The two older Baudelaire orphans Klaus and Violet played by Liam Aiken and Emily Browning do a fine job as children who outwit the clueless adults around them. Their baby sister Sunny played by 21/2-year-old twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman utters gibberish translated to clever subtitled asides. Sunny Violet and every other character in the movie wear Victorian-era garments but 12-year-old Klaus inexplicably sports preppy-style cords and sweaters. Its as if the filmmakers feared turning off young males by putting him in costume. Meryl Streep plays Aunt Josephine a widow who in her youth tamed lions but as a dowager is deathly afraid of household appliances and visits by real estate agents. Billy Connolly plays the unlucky Uncle Monty who studies snakes and entertains the children with serpentine tales. Both succumb to Olafs dastardly deeds. Carrey has said he improvised a good deal on the set and it shows. He has a more modern way of expressing himself than Olaf does in the books. The filmmakers might say that concessions need to be made for a contemporary audience but the movie would have been better served and tonally more consistent by staying truer to the letter and spirit of the books. Though the movie is a literate adventure story the series dark tone is lightened up in the film just enough to make one yearn for the darkly twisted witticisms and pervasive anxiety that made Handlers books uniquely appealing.

It was a four-person jury consisting of three erudite Lemonites Andrew 12; Joanna 10; Charlotte 13 who are all avid fans of the Lemony books; the fourth member was a gray-haired film critic with poor posture who was obviously suffering from a low attendance rate at his overpriced gym. As the driver his role was clear. Sour Patch candy popcorn and soda were consumed to assist the adjudication. And the verdict was issued immediately afterward. A curt nod and positive mumble from Andrew indicated a thumbs-up. The same came from Charlotte who has read all 11 of Daniel Handlers books thank you but has grown too old to be goofily enthusiastic. Joanna who hasnt read all the books yet was the lone dissenter. Well get to her reasons later. But Fat Boy the Driver-Critic loved it. And he gets to write this. The aggregate result good movie great fun. Jim Carrey is wickedly funny as Count Olaf evil guardian of the Baudelaire children Klaus (Liam Aiken) Violet (Emily Browning) and baby Sunny (played by twins Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman).

Reasons abound. But first this The three Baudelaire children the teenage Violet (Emily Browning) her slightly younger brother Klaus (Liam Aiken) and baby sister Sunny (Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman) have suffered a heartbreaking calamity. Their parents have perished in a house fire and the palatial homestead is a heap of charred remains. As the narrator Lemony Snicket (Jude Law the British actor who has apparently agreed to appear in every movie released in 2004) tells us ""this is not a film about a happy little elf."" This is grim classic fare -- far more compelling. The children are informed they are now under the charge of a distant relative the magnificently repulsive Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) whose contempt for children is palpable. (He calls Sunny a monkey with the same distaste one would use for ""rat."") His agenda is clear He intends to steal their substantial inheritance which the children cannot enjoy until Sunny is 18. So Olaf will abide these loathsome squirts for now while he figures out how to dispose of them and reap their fortune. The children realize what hes up to but they cant convince banker Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall) or anyone else about their uncles intentions. Thats their eternal predicament Adults never believe them. Adults never believe children. Without getting into the whole saga -- after all thats the fun of it -- lets talk about the various grown-ups the Baudelaires encounter. After (temporarily) escaping Olafs clutches the children are dispatched to another relative Uncle Monty Montgomery (Billy Connolly) a snake enthusiast who plans to take the three sibs on a snake-procuring adventure in Peru. That is until a certain gentleman with a strange resemblance to Olaf comes calling. Escaping again the children move in with their Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep) whose hypochondria and paranoia are constant. ""Come away from the fridge"" Josephine warns Klaus nervously. ""If it falls itll crush you flat."" Director Brad Silberling who made the quirkily smart ""Moonlight Mile"" has created a deftly dark and amusing tale about beleaguered but spunky children and the eccentric morally compromised adults who confound them. Its the kind of family movie that parents and children (at least the ones able to handle this kind of material) can enjoy without either party feeling compromised or bored. The children are wonderfully distinctive personalities. Violet is deeply resourceful as she demonstrates when Olaf locks the children into a car parked (accidentally on purpose) on a train track. Klauss wealth of knowledge based on deep reading habits also comes in handy. And Sunny well she likes to bite. (We meet her hanging from a dining table feet off the ground holding on to the tables edge with her viselike teeth). Although she seems to be all goo-goos and gagas she has a piquant response (signaled in subtitles) for any adult who underestimates her. But the star not too surprisingly is Carrey. Hes grim and menacing but also hysterical. When Mr. Poe first brings the children to Olafs front door he bids them enter with a booming ""Intrude"" And pretending to be a loving uncle he assures Poe he will ""raise these orphans as if they were actually wanted."" Which brings us to Joannas criticism Count Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. Hes not amusing like Carrey at all. And admittedly there is no scene in which the children are trapped in a car in front of a rushing train. To which I would counter If you cant let Carrey be Carrey put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises as a fake snake expert and a salty dog with a long pipe hes rubbery inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur. He may be embellishing madly but its entertaining stuff indeed. Those walking into the film with purist expectations may be setting themselves up for some disappointment but I daresay most viewers will enjoy themselves. I already look forward to the next one. After all there are 11 books worth of material. LEMONY SNICKETS A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS (PG 108 minutes) -- Contains danger and suspense and dark material. Area theaters.

This may strike adults who believe that family life is going straight to hell as a theme peculiar to our times but such tales which have shown remarkable resilience all the way from the Brothers Grimm through Dickens to Roald Dahl speak to a fundamental human loneliness of which kids are far more aware than we imagine.Thats why being an orphan is a common fantasy of many children and its at least part of the reason why all 10 Lemony Snicket novels have made a tidy fortune for their reclusive author Daniel Handler whose closely guarded privacy has been blown by the arrival of a big-budget movie that collapses three of his books into one. Brad Silberling who made only one childrens movie Casper before taking on the cumbersomely titled Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events faithfully follows the adventures of the three Baudelaire siblings -- Violet (Emily Browning) an inventor; Klaus (a very good Liam Aiken) a budding scientist; and baby Sunny (played by twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman at 2 years old already alumni of General Hospital) who has a useful talent for biting -- who were orphaned when their loving parents died in a mysterious fire. Now they spend their time being shunted from one kindly but dubiously qualified caretaker to the next while fending off their distant relative and legal guardian Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) a monster bent on stealing their considerable family fortune.Silberling has done an admirable job translating the Victorian-Gothic ambiance of Handlers novels. Lemony Snicket which may be the worlds first German Expressionist horror caper for kids is a triumph of scary housing from the gutted Baudelaire mansion to Count Olafs filthy packrats abode to a shack jutting precariously over a churning ocean. But Silberling and writer Robert Gordon have made the fatal error of trying to jolly up the novels which are often funny but never ever cute. The childrens hapless would-be protectors -- Billy Connolly as the snake-festooned Uncle Monty; Meryl Streep as their nervous Nelly of an Aunt Josephine; and Catherine OHara as Count Olafs kindly neighbor Justice Strauss -- are played more for farce than pathos. The biggest culprit of course is Carrey who uses Count Olaf as an excuse to mug his way through several other disguises. Hes as funny and inventive as ever but hes constantly winking at his audience. This is something that Handler never does in his books which for all their celebration of childrens creativity in hurdling obstacles that stand in their way also trust kids to stay the course of his bleak existentialism. In the Lemony Snicket books of which theres a wonderful audio version read by Tim Curry the life of a child is largely about putting out fires and staying afloat on a sea of uncertainty and hostile takeovers. The Victorians may have liked their children more compliant than was necessary but they never placed upon them as we selfishly do today the insufferable burden of being constantly happy.LEMONY SNICKETS A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS | Directed by BRAD SILBERLING | Written by ROBERT GORDON Based on novels by DANIEL HANDLER Produced by LAURIE MacDONALD WALTER F.

If you are familiar with the series of beguiling and morose books by the fabulously glum (but never glumly fabulous) author who calls himself Lemony Snicket on which this slack and hedging movie adaptation is built then you already know how frustrating such a turn of events is. And if you arent already a fervent admirer of the orphaned but resourceful Baudelaire siblings Violet Klaus and their infant sister Sunny or if you dont enjoy being pleasantly concerned about the woeful predicaments in which the children repeatedly find themselves at the hands of Count Olaf the dastardly would-be guardian angling for their fortune then you cannot possibly imagine the opportunity that has been lost in translation. The movie combines bits of the first three Snicket books (from a library currently totaling 11 tragedy-laden volumes) into a representative selection of ill-starred occurrences with movie-only plot elements added in presumably to make the story nicer for quaking adults squeamish about awfulness in the world. And it is my sad duty to report that director Brad Silberling (Moonlight Mile) and screenwriter Robert Gordon have managed quite remarkably to leech most of the essential reader-respectful seriousness of Snickets lugubrious literary style out of the thing. In signing many cool actors to participate with outsize energy (among them Billy Connolly Catherine OHara and Cedric the Entertainer) the filmmakers have overlit the matter-of-fact darkness that is the authors greatest contribution to entertainment for smart and perceptive young people. If on the other hand you have an affection for the Silly Putty character stylings of Jim Carrey then you are in luck because the man of a thousand rubbery faces turns the rococo Count Olaf into a florid goofball more joke than menace. From the moment their oblivious estate executor (Timothy Spall) deposits the Baudelaire orphans with Olaf in his ornately creepy house through all the crises that accumulate in the course of the childrens efforts to survive unprotected in a parentless world (including Violets possibly binding forced marriage to the much older gold-digging Count) Carrey sells Olafs shticky side at the expense of inhabiting the characters more deeply chilling contours. Olaf is a threat to the children one who just wont go away; Carreys biggest threat is that hell never stop clowning around. And since the children themselves are so well-behaved and somber -- Emily Browning as Violet Liam Aiken as Klaus and twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman as little Sunny who likes to bite things -- Carreys Olaf is quite quite energy-consuming. Only great dame Meryl Streep having a galloping good time as the Baudelaires phobic Aunt Josephine knows how to tame this he-shrew. Curiously although the plot additions are simplistic and the ending too happy and regrettably uplifting there is one delicious Lemony element uniquely to be enjoyed in the movie production The enthusiastically pessimistic narration by hard-working Jude Law as Snicket himself is all an enthusiast could wish for. Suitably precise businesslike and charming enough without drowning you in charisma his voice-over is a most fortunate event indeed.

"Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lemony-snicket-s-a-series-of-unfortunate-events ) Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres a little Roald Dahl in Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events and that leads one to wonder what a twisted director like Danny DeVito (Dahls Matilda) or Tim Burton (Dahls Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) could have made out of this film. Its not that Brad Silberlings approach is bad but it lacks a certain zing - the quality that would have elevated Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events from the level of passable Hollywood entertainment to inspired. This film will probably grip children more than adults and while there is enough material in the movie to keep the over-18 crowd interested this is not the best family motion picture currently playing in multiplexes. As almost anyone in the age 8-14 age bracket will tell you the Lemony Snicket books are second in popularity only to Harry Potter (and some would argue that they are more popular). For this first movie the filmmakers have elected to cobble together elements from the first three Lemony Snicket tales (The Bad Beginning The Reptile Room and The Wide Window) resulting in a fast-paced but episodic motion picture. In case a sequel is warranted theres still plenty of untapped material remaining. To date there are eleven Lemony Snicket books and writer Daniel Handler isnt done yet. The title character is played by the ubiquitous Jude Law whose only real contribution to the movie is to provide a voiceover narrative. (Hes also occasionally seen in silhouette.) The real star is Jim Carrey who as the nefarious Count Olaf plays his most sinister character since the Grinch. Although Olaf is not a member of the undead parallels with Dracula arent hard to identify. The name could be an homage to ""Count Orlock"" which was the name of the Dracula character in Nosferatu and Olafs first scene borrows heavily from the meet-and-greet with the Lugosi vampire. Throughout the film its hard to shake the feeling that Olaf isnt quite human. How much of this kids will get is anyones guess... Carrey plays three charactersa| sort of. In addition to Olaf hes also a scientist and a seafarer both of whom are actually Olaf in disguise. The multiple roles give Carrey the opportunity to spread his wings a little. Now that he is pursuing serious projects using his own features the only times when he goes off the deep end a little (showing signs of the flamboyant ""old"" Carrey) is when he is buried under layers of makeup. The story relates Olafs various often elaborate attempts to get his hands on the fortune of the Baudelaire orphans 14-year old Violet (Emily Browning) pre-teen Klaus (Liam Aiken) and infant Sunny (Kara amp; Shelby Hoffman). These three are left on their own when a house fire claims the lives of their parents. Just when things seem their darkest in steps Olaf claiming to be either ""a fourth cousin three times removed or a third cousin four times removed."" Olaf thinks of the childrens arrival as a godsend - free labor and access to a huge sum of money - until he learns that he cant legally touch the money unless the children die. But before he can ensure their demise he is stripped of guardianship. The orphans are given first to Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) then to Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep). All the while however Olaf is plotting to once again get his hands on the Baudelaires and their money. The film features three winning child performances. Emily Browning who plays Violet bears a passing resemblance to Kirsten Dunst and has no trouble convincing us that shes a teenage MacGyver. Likewise Liam Aiken is effective as bookworm Klaus who would probably be a good opponent for Ken Jennings on ""Jeopardy"" The tiny Hoffman twins are delightful although I wonder how much of their characters appeal is the result of the snarky subtitled translations of Sunnys baby-speak. Those comments offer some of A Series of Unfortunate Events biggest laughs. To start this review I mentioned Roald Dahl and its an appropriate connection. Dahl wrote dark warped stories that were ostensibly for children and the Lemony Snicket books are in the same vein. As the movie warns in Mr. Snickets clever opening monologue this isnt a happy movie. Bad things happen. People die (and dont come back from the dead) and children are mistreated. (Perhaps the most shocking moment in the movie occurs when Olaf slaps Klaus across the face - theres no comedy in that blow.) The film is first and foremost a fantasy but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling (Moonlight Mile) credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout. Coupled with its fast pace and occasional cliffhangers that makes it a candidate for an easy recommendation regardless of whether you have previous experience with the books or not.

Snickets macabre tale of three newly orphaned siblings has been lavishly visualized. A correction was made to this review on Dec. 13 2004. ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" adapted from the long-running (11 so far) and enormously successful (27 million copies sold) series of childrens books by the pseudonymous Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) is set in a Dickensian dystopia populated by wise children and menacing grownups. Intended as catnip for ""Harry Potter"" fans Snickets macabre tale of three newly orphaned siblings has been lavishly visualized. But for all its elaborate splendor production pic lacks the feeling and imagination that have distinguished the best recent kidpics. Nevertheless Snickets rabid fan base will stuff Pars stockings with B.O. dollars throughout the holiday season. In keeping with the playful tone of Snickets/Handlers books and their constant pleading with the reader to ""read something else"" pic opens with a mock title sequence for a musical cartoon entitled ""The Littlest Elf"" before Snicket himself (here played by Jude Law) appears to advise viewers the film they are about to see is decidedly unpleasant. ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" then introduces the three Baudelaire siblings Rube Goldberg-like inventor Violet (Emily Browning) voracious reader Klaus (Liam Aiken) and teething infant Sunny (twins Kara and Shelby Hoffman) whose incomprehensible baby talk is amusingly subtitled into English throughout. When the Baudelaire home is destroyed by a mysterious fire killing both parents the children are entrusted to the care of their closest relative -- closest referring to distance rather than bloodlines. And so the tykes end up in the deceptively welcoming arms of Count Olaf (Jim Carrey) an alleged ""actor"" whose chin narrows to a dramatic point and whose tufts of wiry hair dart from his head as if trying to flee. Soon Olaf subjects his young relations to Cinderella-like chores while plotting to defraud them of their inheritance money. ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" gets bogged down here with Carrey in the kind of hyperactive mode where a little goes a long way. In a turn that couldnt be further from his subdued everyman in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" Carrey is turned loose by director Brad Silberling and permitted to vamp up and down the screen in whatever way he sees fit. The more pic indulges in these antics the more it starts to feel less like ""Harry Potter"" and more like ""Ace Ventura."" Pic picks up again when the kids having momentarily escaped from Olafs sinister machinations find themselves in the care of their herpetologist uncle (Billy Connolly) who hints that the death of the Baudelaire parents may be tied to a larger conspiracy. A warm welcome presence whose constant adornment with snakes may trigger memories of ""Alexander"" in some Connolly gives the kind of eccentric but controlled comic turn thats like Carrey turned down by 50%. Olaf inevitably surfaces again this time disguised as an ""Italian gentleman"" who before long has finagled a way to wrest the children back into his ""care."" As before while its initially hilarious to see Carrey under elaborate prosthetic makeup peddling an accent thats closer to Rome Wis. than Rome Italy this routine too becomes tiresome. The Baudelaires ricochet between Olaf (in a variety of loopy guises courtesy of makeup artist Bill Corso and costumer Colleen Atwood) and other potential foster parents including Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep) who was once a great adventurer before becoming a timid prisoner in her dramatic cliffside home. Clearly inspired by the work of Roald Dahl and the Brothers Grimm Snickets novels are targeted at children with a hearty appetite for the dark gruesome and mysterious. The film version is at its best when it allows Klaus Violet and Sunny to work their way out of perilous predicaments using only their wits and their special talents -- particularly in one spectacular set piece involving Aunt Josephines house. But as with the first two ""Harry Potter"" entries ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" ultimately feels like the triumph of literal-mindedness over lyricism. It also has a hollow emotional core. At no point in the film do the Baudelaire children seem truly mournful over the death of their parents nor does Silberlings imagery eye-grabbing as it may be ever truly transport viewers into a fully fleshed-out meta-reality. While kids are certain to be entertained by the sheer accumulation of incident parents may well find themselves checking their watches. Set in Boston in an unspecified time that is all moody fog and gloom ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" suggests what ""Mary Poppins"" might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly Burtons longtime production designer Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets while ace d.p. Emmanuel Lubezki (Burtons ""Sleepy Hollow"") contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes.
