Teenager Richard Karlsen (Jack Reynor) has it all hes charming privileged loved by his friends and family ready to head out to university and a glittering career. But when his flirtation with Lara (Roisin Murphy) turns serious Richard incurs the wrath of her ex Conor (Sam Keeley). Its not long before things turn ugly.Filmed simply and centred around improvisation and naturalistic dialogue What Richard Did stands or falls on its performances. Luckily Abramson has discovered something remarkable in 19-year-old Reynor whose Boyzone blue eyes mask true acting chops. Grabbing hold of a very tricky role he offers a precise beautifully modulated performance shifting from a self-assured but always likable teen to a conflicted cornered young man staring down the barrel of a bleak future.At only 87 minutes What Richard Did feels a little slight the ending in particular comes as an abrupt surprise - but maybe thats because weve come to care deeply for these characters. Abrahamson has pulled off something quietly remarkable a study of morality which never feels like a treatise a bracingly realistic film about teenagers which never becomes patronising and a gripping melodrama which swerves sentiment. He may also have unearthed a genuine star.

By Anthony Lane The grandeur of ""Les Miserables"" may have confused the directors sense of scale.   Credit Illustration by Istvan Orosz The long and thunderous film of ""Les Miserables"" arises from the stage musical which itself was adapted from Victor Hugos enormous novel. Yet the story at heart is an intimate one. Valjean (Hugh Jackman) serves nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread a punishment that he regards as unjust though in fact it reflects well on the status of French baking. Had he taken a croissant it would have meant the guillotine. In 1815 he breaks parole vanishes and emerges eight years later as a respectable factory owner and the mayor of Montreuil. There he is dimly recognized as a former convict by Javert (Russell Crowe) the local police inspector. These two cross paths for the rest of the film with Javert in panting pursuit. Would it be too fanciful to suggest that they have a thing for each other to which they never confess? That would explain why Crowe and Jackman both tough Australians are made to sing at so agonized a pitch. Crowe launches into his lusty anthems as if a platoon of infantry stationed in his immediate rear had just fixed bayonets without giving sufficient warning. Then there is a layer of lesser plots. A poor wench named Fantine (Anne Hathaway) one of Valjeans workers loses her job becomes a prostitute and dies though not before summoning enough puff to sing ""I Dreamed a Dream."" She leaves a daughter whom Valjean raises as his own. We jump to 1832 with Paris in a rebellious mood and the child Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) all grown up. She draws the gaze of Marius (Eddie Redmayne) a young hothead who in turn is the idol of his neighbor Eponine (Samantha Barks). And so the action gathers steam and comes to the barricades--or to be exact to a single barricade with an anti-monarchist uprising represented by a small group of students sitting on a pile of furniture. The director is Tom Hooper fresh from ""The Kings Speech"" and you cant help wondering if this shift into grandeur has confused his sense of scale. The camera soars on high the orchestra bellows and then whenever somebody feels a song coming on we are hustled in close forsaking our birds-eye view for that of a consultant rhinologist. The actors were recorded live as they belted out the big numbers and Hathaway in particular takes full advantage turning in precisely the sort of performance down to the last sniff that she would be the first to lampoon on ""Saturday Night Live."" Not that you can blame her. She probably took one look at the material and realized that the only way to survive it was by the naked power of oomph. I was unprepared having missed ""Les Miserables"" onstage for the remarkable battle that flames between music and lyrics each vying to be more uninspired than the other. The lyrics put up a good fight but you have to hand it to the score a cauldron of harmonic mush with barely a hint of spice or a note of surprise. Some of Hoopers cast acquit themselves with grace notably Redmayne and its a relief to see Sacha Baron Cohen in the role of a seamy innkeeper bid goodbye to Cosette with the wistful words ""Farewell Courgette."" One burst of farce however is not enough to redress the basic inflationary bombast that defines ""Les Miserables."" Fans of the original production no doubt will eat the movie up and good luck to them. I screamed a scream as time went by. The new Quentin Tarantino picture ""Django Unchained"" stars Jamie Foxx as a slave named Django and mid-nineteenth-century America as the chains. Our hero is freed by Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a bounty hunter posing as a dentist who appears to have escaped from a Bunuel film; trim of beard and florid of rhetoric he would rather die than act uncivilly and would rather kill than prolong an unsavory argument. He needs Django as a witness to identify potential targets and the pair become a team dispatching wanted men and handing over the corpses for cash. The first half of the tale is skillfully balanced the best thing that Tarantino has done since ""Jackie Brown"" and its comedy bristles with barbs. To watch a posse of marauding Klansmen hooded with white bags complain that they cant see through the eyeholes is to wish dearly that D. W. Griffith who lauded the Klan in ""The Birth of a Nation"" were at ones side. But something happens to the pace and the poise of ""Django Unchained"" as the hunters head South and the screen fills with the word ""Mississippi."" Here resides Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) slave owner brocaded fop and master of Candyland the plantation estate where his subjects toil among them Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) Djangos wife. But is Tarantino truly engaged with those subjects? He is happy to film whippings in unstinting detail or the incarceration of Broomhilda whom Django has come to save. Yet she barely exists as a character and even Django seems to morph from a near-silent sufferer into an avenging angel grinning in glory without passing through the usual stages of personhood. What really grips Tarantino is the chance to bait us as he has done before with metronomic mentions of the N-word--uttered with especial relish by Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) the majordomo of Candyland and the most terrifying of Uncle Toms. The reason for the crawl and slither of these later scenes is plain the director is coiling himself as is his wont for an apocalypse of blood. Dr. Schultz triggers it with one brief deed. ""I couldnt resist"" he says and that mix of mock-apology and merry boast is purest Tarantino. He has such a fine eye and his travelling shots of horses and riders are a hint of what tremendous cowboy flicks he might have made in a straighter age but his films continue to be snared in a tangle of morality and style. Tarantino is dangerously in love with the look of evil and all he can counter it with is cool--not strength of purpose let alone goodness of heart but simple comeuppance issued with merciless panache. That is what Django delivers and its the least that Candie deserves together with other defenders of the Southern status quo such at any rate will be the claim of Tarantinos fans although I was disturbed by their yelps of triumphant laughter at the screening I attended as a white woman was blown away by Djangos gun. By the time Tarantino shows up as a redneck with an unexplained Australian accent ""Django Unchained"" has mislaid its melancholy and its bitter wit and become a raucous romp. It is a tribute to the spaghetti Western cooked al dente then cooked a while more and finally sauced to death. Apart from a short scene at a piano recital and a bus ride home the whole of Michael Hanekes ""Amour"" unfolds inside that home. Far from being claustrophobic it is a place where happiness has taken root and bloomed a placid Parisian apartment lined with bookshelves and inhabited by Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and his wife Anne (Emmanuelle Riva). If there is a prison here (and we should expect no less from the director of ""Funny Games"" and ""The White Ribbon"") it is that of the human body. The couple are elderly and when at breakfast Anne stops still--freeze-framed we learn by ""obstruction of the carotid""--the moment marks the start of her entrapment. In vain will she beat against the bars. To give away what happens in ""Amour"" is no big deal because it happens to everyone. It is the coming attraction that we dread and from which cinema by and large has turned its face just as Anne her condition worsening flinches from a mirror. To an extent she is lucky--she is not alone in her decline and after an operation she returns in a wheelchair to be looked after by Georges. Her movement is restricted on one side; speech falters and dies to a moan; diapers are required. He gives her spoonfuls of pureed food as if she were a child. Their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) comes to visit and the mere clop of her heels on the wooden floor spells drama and distress which exasperates her father who never weeps and who occupies himself solely with the duties of care. ""Your concern is no use to me"" he says to Eva. You know that hes right yet there is a discernible thread of steel in his attitude as sharp as the cutting of the film and what makes ""Amour"" so strong and clear is that it allows Haneke to anatomize his own severity. Anne for example used to teach piano and for a few tender seconds we see her play Schubert in Georgess imagination. Then we think of ""The Piano Teacher"" (2001) in which Hanekes heroine was led by a musical rapport into a lethal amour fou. Does the new film redeem such horror or is all beauty fated to be ominous and frail? It was a masterstroke to cast Riva whose sweetness of face and manner is as unfaded as that of any actress alive. We instinctively believe as Georges does of Anne that she should abide forever. But she will not. There have been many invasions in Hanekes work and there is indeed an attempted break-in at the start of this film but nothing compares with the looming approach of mortality. Even Georgess resources are of no avail and that is why he is forced to consider at the last gasp what love requires him to do. All amour is fou.

Starring Hugh Jackman Russell Crowe Anne Hathaway Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne. Directed by Tom Hooper. (PG-13. 157 minutes.) At the heart of the ""Les Miserables"" movie was a good idea that just didnt work out this time. The idea was that the actors should sing their songs live on camera. In almost every other musical youve ever seen the actors lip-sync to a recorded track but singing live offers the possibility for more risk and excitement along with spontaneous acting moments that simply cant happen if an actor has to think about moving his lips a certain way. To some degree director Tom Hooper (""The Kings Speech"") got what he was looking for. Anne Hathaways version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" for example is very in-the-moment with an emotional freshness you rarely see in musicals. But with every gain there is a loss. Most of the songs in ""Les Miserables"" are contemplative - internal monologues that translated to film lend themselves to close-up. In close-up the actors sing as they would speak to someone close by quietly and naturalistically. In the case of Hathaway the close scrutiny takes the grandeur out of her big song and though the quality of her acting is indisputable she sobs through half of it. You know what they say on Broadway When there are tears on the stage there are dry eyes in the house. Yet Hathaway thrives compared with Hugh Jackman on whose performance as Jean Valjean the entire film turns. As anyone who has ever heard him knows Jackman when he sings in full voice has a high pinging pleasing tenor thats a precision instrument. Its a voice that can thrill an audience. But for most of ""Les Miserables"" he is in half voice singing in close-up and in half-voice Jackman is a disaster. His voice quavers and wobbles in and out of tune. There are times in ""Les Miserables"" where you might think the music is an experiment in atonal composition. But no thats Jackman. One measure of just how unmanned Jackman is by this restraint is that Russell Crowe as Valjeans nemesis Inspector Javert often sounds no worse than Jackman does and Crowe cant sing to save his life. Crowe can act however and he can treat ""Les Miserables"" as though it were just another dramatic film albeit with singing which it is. Thats a problem. An adaptation of the stage musical which was in turn adapted from the eponymous Victor Hugo novel ""Les Miserables"" tells the story of Valjean who is released from prison having done time for stealing a loaf of bread. After he breaks the law again he spends the rest of his life on the run living under an assumed name and trying to escape the reach of Javert who isnt cruel so much as infuriatingly unimaginative. His plodding dogmatic adherence to the law is contrasted with Valjeans impulsive compassion with Valjean emerging as the true (unconscious) Christian and Javert as the true (unconscious) monster. Such a metaphysical story cries out for a heightened atmosphere one that you might find in a stage musical. Unfortunately the transplanting of material from one medium to another is always a delicate procedure and sometimes the patient dies. In the case of ""Les Miserables"" film literalizes the story and makes maudlin or ridiculous that which might have seemed poetic on the stage. The notion of Valjeans having served time for stealing bread loses its metaphorical significance and seems more like a hard luck story that Valjean just wont stop harping on. Likewise the young revolutionaries in Act II - hiding behind barricades and fighting the entire French army - dont seem like heroes so much as idiots getting themselves slaughtered for no good reason. The cast is more than adequate - Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried as the young lovers Samantha Barks as the forlorn Eponine - but theyre trapped within a design in which the characters seem to care more about their problems than the audience. Likewise we might say nice things about Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as lowdown cockney innkeepers but the real conversation we should be having is whether those characters should have been included in the movie at all. We also might want to ask why all these French characters not only have English accents but are presented as stock British types. The French and the English are not exactly interchangeable as we all know from the Middle Ages. When Bob Fosse made ""Cabaret"" he completely reimagined it for the screen. He threw out songs and added a song - ""Maybe This Time"" - and the result was a classic film. Hooper by contrast essentially blows out the stage ""Les Miserables"" into a big gorgeous blockbuster but its a straight conversion such that you can still see the act break. He doesnt account for inconvenient details for example that on screen its not wise to play the same scene over and over (e.g. Javert shows up Valjean escapes). Nor is it a good idea to have three ballads in a row. Fans of ""Les Miserables"" wouldnt have minded if the movie were different but better or just as effective. The screen version demanded some reconception some vision to make sense of its existence. Instead were left with a film that is conscientious in all its particulars and yet strangely and mysteriously dead. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Maybe both? Universal I dreamed a dream in time gone by in time gone by so very...slowly.The words (at least the first eight of them) are from the fallen Fantines mournful aria in the first act of Les Miserables. In Tom Hoopers new cinematic adaptation of the beloved musical the song is sung by Anne Hathaway and your response to it will likely be a good barometer of your response to the film overall. Hathaway gives it everything she has beginning in quiet sorrow before building to a woebegone climax she gasps she weeps she coughs. If you are blown away by the scene--as many will be; it will almost certainly earn Hathaway her first Oscar--this may be the film for you. If however like me you feel that its poignant plaintive beginnings give way to an overwrought ostentatious conclusion--well you have a long 157 minutes ahead of you.

As anyone whos seen the films oddly infomercial-like theatrical trailer will be aware Hooper has taken the innovative step of having cast members sing their numbers live on film rather than lip-synching to pre-recorded tracks. Its a genuine breakthrough As the performers lift their voices the camera holds them in intimate closeup; the experience is about as close to live theater youre likely to find onscreen. Alas like so many innovators Hooper falls rather too much in love with his innovation. The second or third time we watch a face fill the screen with notes tender or tragic the effect is genuinely arresting. The 22nd or 23rd time...Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe star as Victor Hugos ages-old antagonists Jean Valjean the saintly ex-con and Javert the pious obstinate policeman intent on returning him to prison. The actors offer a fascinating contrast in styles. Jackman is a veteran of musical theater with a Tony (and an Emmy for hosting the Tonys) under his belt; Crowe is an actor one doesnt generally envision singing at all--unless its in a pub with several pints under his belt. But Jackman appears slightly confounded by the possibilities of Hoopers up-close cinema; like Hathaway (who also has a strong voice) he often seems as though hes trying a little too hard to act his way through his songs with slightly disappointing results. Crowe by contrast though possessed of a thin reedy instrument (indeed one presumes because of it) focuses intently on his singing and somewhat outperforms his humble gifts. There is an odd unexpected dignity to the sight of a man so obviously out of place and yet trying so hard to make the best of it.Hooper has cast members sing their numbers live on film rather than lip sync. Alas like so many innovators Hooper falls rather too much in love with his innovation. Amanda Seyfried plays Cosette daughter of doomed Fantine and adopted daughter of Jean Valjean; and Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter lend the proceedings a Sweeney Toddish air as the comically villainous M. et Mme. Thenardier. But the greatest treats on offer are Samantha Barker as Eponine (also doomed life in 19th century Paris being no picnic) and especially Eddie Redmayne as Marius whose lament-filled ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" is the best number in the film. Like Hugos famously commodious novel Hoopers film begins in 1815 and concludes in the proletarian rebellion of June 1832 with the intervening years stuffed full of love and loss hardship and hauteur ardent revolution and heartbreaking defeat. Javert stares out at Notre Dame from the roof of the Conciergerie; the proletarian rebels crawl about the towering moldering Elephant of the Bastille (a painful reminder no doubt to Baz Luhrmann that hes not the only director who can kill off his pretty heroines with tuberculosis). The music ebbs and swells as the story rolls through its epic climax and into an extended denouement of such hokey theatricality--featuring the ascent and descent respectively of its principal antagonists--that it might better have been viewed from a distance so viewers could focus on the music rather than on Jackmans old-man makeup.Les Miserables is a big impressive film and committed fans of the musical are likely to have their affections reaffirmed. The less devout however may conclude that in this case more is less and fidelity not always a virtue.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Starring Hugh Jackman Russell Crowe Anne Hathaway Director Tom Hooper Release Opened Dec 25 2012  Editorial Review More is more and every songs a showstopper By Ann HornadayFriday December 28 2012There are moments early on in ""Les Miserables"" when viewers may feel like theyre about to witness a bona fide disasterpiece one of those spectacular miscalculations that can be almost as entertaining -- almost -- as a superbly executed work of audacious ambition and scope. For better or worse though this adaptation of the mega-hit Broadway musical fits neither description largely because it lives in that kinda-sorta okay-not-great this-worked-that-didnt in-between for which words like ""better"" and ""worse"" fall woefully short. Less a fully realized film than a strung-together series of set pieces showstoppers diva moments and production numbers ""Les Miserables"" contains multitudes -- not only in the form of a huge cast but in its own contradictions. If by the films inescapably stirring final half hour even the most inured audience members find themselves weeping openly for the storys tragic heroines plucky revolutionaries and idealistic young lovers its less a testament to Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublils strident music and lyrics or Tom Hoopers wildly uneven direction than to the fact that somehow the wheels dont come off entirely. But enough faint praise. Theres plenty to cheer in ""Les Miserables"" not the least of which is the presence of some genuinely astonishing breakout performances. Eddie Redmayne -- most recently seen as the eager young production assistant in ""My Week With Marilyn"" -- delivers by far the most moving and memorable performance in the film as the young firebrand Marius who along with his fellow students is caught up in Frances political upheavals in the 19th century. Based on Victor Hugos novel ""Les Miserables"" juxtaposes Mariuss fight for political justice with the more personal struggle of Jean Valjean whom we meet in the films opening scene as an enslaved prisoner played by an unrecognizably emaciated Hugh Jackman. We also meet Valjeans nemesis Javert (Russell Crowe) the vengeful police inspector who when Valjean breaks parole will pursue him obsessively even when the former convict becomes a respectable businessman and mayor. Its during these introductory sequences that ""Les Miserables"" is at its most wobbly with Hooper editing frantically between and within scenes. Once he calms down he finds the films rhythm which at its most gratifying finds Hooper simply resting the camera on individual singers as they deliver the tunes the shows fans came to hear. Its at just such a moment when Redmayne swings for the rafters singing the mournful ballad ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" an agonizing tribute to his fallen brothers that eerily conjures more recent losses whether by way of the AIDS epidemic or more literal wars. Earlier Redmayne sings a delightful trio with Amanda Seyfried and Samantha Barks who as love interests Cosette and Eponine display superb command of the upper registers the composers favor. (There are moments when Redmayne and Seyfried resemble a modern-day Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald in their fluting bird-like lyricism.) The centerpiece of a movie composed entirely of centerpieces belongs to Anne Hathaway who as the tragic heroine Fantine sings another of the memorable numbers in a show of surprisingly few hummable tunes. Her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" -- delivered in shattering close-up the better to accentuate her haggard face violently shorn hair and angular half-starved body -- is a melodramatic tour de force of vocal and physical expression a Picasso-like abstract of voice mouth and tears. Ever since Hathaway and Jackman performed a fake-impromptu number on the Oscars a few years back the prospect of them doing ""Les Miserables"" together has been the subject of anticipation if not outright salivating. But their performances -- while undoubtedly impressive -- arent the high points of the production. Hooper made the commendable decision to have the cast perform the score live rather than lip-synch to pre-recorded music which lends ""Les Miserables"" a welcome air of spontaneity and excitement (its more an opera than a musical lacking any spoken dialogue of note). But there are times when Hathaways and Jackmans Broadway-baby voices -- groomed to project from the proscenium arch -- sound brassy and labored especially when Jackman shares a number with Crowe who possesses the mellow earthy tones of a crooner rather than a belter. When he sings alongside Jackmans practiced nasal vibrato (wow can he nail that high note on ""two-four-six-oh-ooooone"") its as if Elvis Costello had unexpectedly crashed an Ethel Merman musical with predictable chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter results. Show-tune purists may prefer Jackmans and Hathaways styles; I preferred Crowes moodier more soulful delivery. But everyone will be cheered by the arrival of Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as Mr. and Mrs. Thenardier the slatternly tavern keepers who leaven the unrelenting grimness of ""Les Miserables"" with welcome dashes of slapstick humor and crass bad taste. Those moments of levity are sorely needed in a production weighed down by a crushing sense of bombast and self-importance. Theres little sense of dynamism or pacing a fault both of the original score and Hoopers unimaginative staging and camera work which tend to underline italicize and boldface every emotional beat. Its all Very Big All the Time -- which may serve the shows die-hard fans well but may not persuade those who have been immune to its hysterically pitched charms until now. Theres no denying that ""Les Miserables"" ultimately succeeds in gathering up the audience -- even its most resistent members -- and transporting it on a stirring swelling wave of feeling. But even when theyre dabbing away tears during the last of the big numbers they might wonder whether theyre feeling less uplifted than run over.Contains suggestive and sexual material violence and thematic elements.

RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Jackman Hathaway This Les Miserables will get up close and personal Qamp;A Seyfried Redmayne With Les Miz a new kind of speech for Tom Hooper By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Mon Dec 24 2012 1150 AM If you like your musicals enormous over the top and bang-on-the-head manipulative ""Les Miserables"" is the movie for you.Based on the mega-successful musical which is in turn based on Victor Hugos massive novel the film comes at you with all cylinders firing from the start with a trumped-up intensity that after awhile MAKES WATCHING IT THE CINEMATIC EQUIVALENT OF READING ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.Some people enjoy that kind of thing evidently.Where to begin? (I feel like I should be singing.) If youre not a fan of the musical or havent read the book heres a quick synopsis to the extent that anything about this production can be done quickly which includes watching it (its two hours and 37 minutes long).In 19th century France Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) stole a loaf of bread to feed his starving sister and her child and was imprisoned. After 19 years which included a few escape attempts he is freed. But the sadistic Javert (Russell Crowe) sees to it that Valjean is branded a dangerous man which pretty much shoots down any chance of future employment or any future at all.Valjean breaks parole and embarks on a new life becoming a factory owner and mayor of a town years later. In director Tom Hoopers version of the story we see the plight of the poor up close. Meanwhile Javert pursues him doggedly. Valjean inadvertently causes the ruin of Fantine (Anne Hathway). He takes in her daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen as a child the big-voiced Amanda Seyfried as an adult) but Javert catches up to him again so Valjean disappears with Cosette again.When next we see them years have passed. Cosette has fallen for Marius (Eddie Redmayne) a revolutionary. Valjean worries about Cosette both because she is growing up and because he fears for Marius safety. And Javert is still lurking around out there on the hunt.OK now imagine all this sung at top volume.Hooper makes an interesting choice He didnt prerecord the actors singing but had them sing live. Which is all well and good but doesnt mean much unless it brings an immediacy to the performances. On that front it varies.Jackman is a seasoned stage actor and a good singer. Hes not astonishing as Valjean or anything not particularly moving but plenty good. Redmayne is better breathing life into the character beyond mere lyrics. Hathaway is best of all the best thing about the movie in fact. Her performances introduce an ingredient found almost nowhere else in the film restraint. You probably wont mistake her for an opera singer but there is such heartbreak and disappointment in her voice it doesnt really matter.Which leaves us with Crowe. He sings in rock bands hes a really good actor and when hes standing around looking menacing hes perfectly believable.And then he opens his mouth and. ...Its not that hes awful. Its that hes overmatched. This is not a deal-breaker. Hes in there swinging giving it his all. But hes not quite up to the task.There is a reason ""Les Miserables"" is such an astounding success as a musical. Its melodrama thats fun to chew on with overly obvious references to humanity and depravity to law and its trickier cousin justice. All that is on display here. Boy is it ever. How much you enjoy the film is going to depend greatly on your capacity for having these ideas pounded against your head time and again set to catchy tunes.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(UNIVERSAL) In the world of Broadway musicals ""Les Miserables"" would seem to have it all - a solid literary property a strong conflict a love triangle and plenty of epic sweep. And certainly something won it fervent fans several decades ago - and has kept them ever since. But to the still unconvinced its operatic wall-to-wall score seems to be missing some melodies. And its new movie adaptation is definitely lacking the musical performers it needs to put all of those songs over or a cinematic approach that would make any of it new. Like the show the film follows the plot of Victor Hugos (often filmed) ""Les Miserables"" the story of a poor Frenchman sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread. After his hard time is served he falls into trouble again and is pursued by the relentless policeman Javert even as Valjean rises to become a respected member of society. Its very ""I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang"" - but with baguettes. Also with a call for violent revolution against a totalitarian government -- and a meditation on how true peace only comes from forgiving your enemies their injustices. Those last two ideas seem to be in odd opposition - why would it be wrong for Valjean to kill a vindictive policeman but right that the young revolutionaries kill oppressive soldiers? Its a tricky distinction the musical chooses not to explore. But thoughtfulness is in short supply in Tom Hoopers direction which consistently paints the plot with broad strokes and seems determined to ram the camera down his stars throats. Everything is writ large. A love scene gets the CGI addition of a sparkling butterfly; a dying character falls back against a banner that helpfully reads ""Mort."" (Although the story itself is overdone - with not one but two characters suddenly dying of Convenient Movie Disease.) Exaggerated too is the supposed comic relief provided by Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen as a pair of thieving innkeepers. Neither has ever been accused of underselling a scene; here they basically hold us down and shout in our faces. Theyre lowpoints in the film seeming refugees from ""Sweeney Todd"" (and Helena please - give the fright-wigged characters a rest would you?) Anne Hathaway though is perfectly cast as Fantine an innocent on a greased slide into hell who quickly slips into a nighttown world of vice and violence that even Fellini might have drawn back from. Shes terrific in the part which should be a surprise only to those who didnt see her ""Carnival"" in New York in 2002 (or any of those musicals she did back at old Millburn High). A supporting-actress Oscar nomination would seem to be a lock. But Russell Crowe whose voice never rises above a rumble is more problematic as Javert and even Hugh Jackman occasionally struggles with the score particularly Valjeans higher notes. And Im not sure its a fight worth winning. Composer Claude-Michel Schonberg has a fondness for short endlessly repeated musical phrases; rather than building to a soaring conclusion many of his songs just seem to peter out. That didnt keep ""Les Miserables"" from being a huge hit onstage of course. But so was the same teams ""Miss Saigon"" and can you remember anything from that musical now besides the helicopter? The music was never the show; the show was. Whats impressive on a small Broadway stage though is less impressive in a movie where spectacle comes cheap and attention spans grow small. And if all that you remember of the original ""Les Miz"" experience was the big cast and the inescapable merchandizing - well a few hours watching this adaptation and you may be one of the miserable ones too. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations and violence. Les Miserables (PG-13) Universal (160 min.) Directed by Tom Hooper. With Hugh Jackman Anne Hathaway Russsell Crowe.

Handout photo Laurie Sparham Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean in ""Les Miserables."" If you agree with the ads that say ""Les Miserables"" is ""the most loved musical of all time"" its conceivable that youve never heard the word ""Hammerstein"" and might get swept into the emotional maelstrom of this film adaptation. If on the other hand youve read the novel on which it was based seen a musical that predates ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" or actually experienced hunger in your life this ugly edifice at the corner of Hollywood and Hugo will feel like prison.A French prison camp is where we meet Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman). It is 1815 26 years after the revolution that briefly deposed the cruel monarchy. As recounted in the first of the turgid story-songs that substitute for dialogue Valjean has served 19 years of hard labor for stealing a loaf a bread and then trying to escape his punishment.On the day he is freed Valjean is warned that he will never escape the scrutiny of the state as embodied by the guard Javert (Russell Crowe). But although Valjean struggles to find a job with the help of a kindly monk he breaks parole and starts a new life under a new name. Flash forward eight years and Valjean is a sweat-shop owner and mayor of a small town where Javert is the suspicious new police inspector. When Valjeans employee Fantine (Anne Hathaway) is driven from the factory by jealous co-workers the young mother is forced to sell her body (literally and figuratively) to send money to her daughter Cosette who is living with cruel innkeepers (Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen).Stricken by conscience Valjean is too late to save Fantine but he vows to find and raise Cosette. Just when Javert deduces the mayors true identity Valjean and the girl escape.Flash forward another nine years. Valjean and Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) are living large in Paris with no visible means of support. In the blink of a blue eye Cosette catches the attention of anti-royal revolutionary Marius (Eddie Redmayne). To save his adopted daughters true love Valjean must join Marius and the other protesters at the bloody barricades alongside a spy -- Javert Victor Hugos beloved socially conscious novel ""Les Miserables"" is one of the longest works in Western literature. Compressing it into a movie is a challenge that has daunted many screenwriters. But though this adaptation is a grueling 21/2 hours long it still suffers badly from the inherent limitations of musical-theater plotting. Fantines tragic demise is demoted to a short subplot and Cosette and Marius fall in love at first sight (with a revolting song to prove it) while significant swaths of Valjeans life are consigned to on-screen footnotes.Thats typical of many musicals of course but director Tom Hooper (""The Kings Speech"") has deviated from the theatrical norm in some significant ways. Most notably the actors sing live instead of lip-syncing to a pre-recorded track. Hooper has said he was aiming for realism. Thats a rather dubious goal for an inherently artificial genre and Hoopers gambit merely exposes the weak voices of several cast members. Although Jackman is a stage-trained singer and Hathaway is a trouper Seyfried Redmayne and especially Crowe are woeful vocalists who try to disguise their flat voices with trilling crescendos. On the plus side pedestrian singers Carter Cohen and young Daniel Huttlestone (as pint-size provocateur Gavroche) add a needed seasoning of humor. And although Hooper is prone to repulsive wide-angle close-ups of street dwellers he also opens up the proscenium with scenic vistas.Fans of the franchise will greet ""Les Miserables"" as a feast for the senses but the rest of us are left with crumbs.What ""Les Miserables""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 237  Content Suggestive material violence and adult themes Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

I reply with a hearty yes it is certainly all of those things -- in the best possible ways.Its also gorgeously filmed almost perfectly acted and one of the most emotionally devastating and gratifying movies Ive ever seen. If that doesnt qualify as ""true art"" Im not sure what would.Director Tom Hooper has crafted something of a Christmas miracle with his adaptation of the stage musical by Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil which has been running pretty much continuously around the world since its Paris premiere in 1980.Hooper both stays utterly faithful to the original and also astonishingly makes the story entirely his own.Like the musical this take on Victor Hugos 1862 novel is nearly completely sung with perhaps 100 words of spoken dialogue. Also like the stage production it narrows the books enormous range to home in on the tale of Jean Valjean (the extraordinary Hugh Jackman) who spends 20 years as a hard-time prisoner for stealing a loaf of bread and his foe Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) who pursues Valjean after he breaks parole and changes his identity his profession and his heart going from fiercely bitter thief to God-fearing businessman and mayor.A student uprising Valjeans adoption of Cosette the daughter of one of his factory workers and a romantic triangle add layers amid the storys central tension.Where the movie differs from the musical and surpasses it is in its intimacy.Here you not only imagine the blood smoke and sweat at the barricade you witness it in visceral close-up -- including the brutal death of a child that will strike some viewers especially hard given the tragedy in Connecticut.You watch the droplets falling on the pained face of Eponine (Samantha Banks) as she meets her fate in ""A Little Fall of Rain."" You take in the agony in Marius (Eddie Redmayne) eyes as he mourns his friends in ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables.""Foremost you get gut-punching glimpses into the tormented hearts of Fantine (Cosettes mother played by an angelic Anne Hathaway) Valjean and Javert.Much has been said about Hathaways performance and if she doesnt win an Oscar for her choking desperate version of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" there is no justice. Put all thoughts of Susan Boyle out of your mind.The real revelations here are Jackman and Redmayne. Both sing like Broadway gods (in fact Jackman sounds a lot like Colm Wilkinson Broadways original Valjean who appears in the movie as a kindly bishop). Jackmans transformative ""Valjeans Soliloquy"" in which the character turns to God scorches with its power and pathos.Crowe isnt as good a singer as the others but he makes up for it with haunting insight into Javert who ultimately is as much a victim as anyone else in the story.Yes the film is depressing -- think about the title after all. But it does have a touch of comedy courtesy of over-the-top Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as Cosettes disgusting conniving foster parents.Les Miserables is also gloriously uplifting heartening and hopeful.

Shes that good. Its also Hathaways last big moment in the movie as the single-mother-turned-prostitute Fantine who dies early in the story. Its a testament to the performances delivered by the actors in the films bigger roles that the remaining two hours arent spent wishing for more Fantine. Its also a testament to the strength of Claude-Michel Schonbergs music that everything after the show-stopping lament of Fantines ""I Dreamed a Dream"" doesnt come across as so much padding. Watch Clips Parole Parole Credit Universal Pictures My Daughter My Daughter Credit Universal Pictures Who Am I? Who Am I? Credit Universal Pictures On My Own On My Own Credit Universal Pictures Schonbergs diverse songwriting has always been the shows greatest asset matching the impressively epic scope of the story -- adapted from Victor Hugos gargantuan historical novel about the lives of a number of interconnected characters in the years leading up to the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris -- with an equally impressive range of musical styles. Huge patriotic anthems coexist alongside wistful love songs comic barroom pieces with tragic laments the joints smoothed over by the composers habit of frequently echoing themes and familiar bits of melody. Theres plenty of opportunity for those musical quotes too as the work is nearly devoid of spoken dialogue through-sung with recitative sections connecting the larger pieces. Hooper makes some interesting casting decisions blending accomplished musical theater actors with some not known for their voices. Broadway veteran Hugh Jackman takes on the central role of Jean Valjean the honorable ex-con around whom all these other lives seem to revolve. Samantha Barks is the only actor here to reprise a role she played onstage as Eponinethe daughter of two crooked innkeepers -- Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen in excellently conceived comic casting. Hathaway stands out as an actor not generally associated with musicals; others in that category not so much like the slightly too-warbly Amanda Seyfried as Fantines daughter Cosette and thin-voiced Eddie Redmayne as the revolutionary romantic Marius who falls for her. Then again their love-at-first-sight romance is the least interesting subplot of the film so its difficult for them to rise above the blandness of their story. i Jean Valjean and young Cosette (Isabelle Allen) two of the most iconic characters in contemporary musical theater come to the big screen. Laurie Sparham/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Laurie Sparham/Universal Pictures Jean Valjean and young Cosette (Isabelle Allen) two of the most iconic characters in contemporary musical theater come to the big screen. Laurie Sparham/Universal Pictures The biggest surprise though may be Russell Crowe as Javert the dogged inspector who tracks Valjean over the 17 years covered by the film. At first listen Crowe sounds miscast a barroom singer put on a stage too large. Yet his brutish vocal presence tends to fit Javert who is in many ways the movies most fascinating character a man who plays an instrument of blind justice when hes really carrying out a lifetime of revenge for the sins of his parents. His transformation from emotionless oppressor to penitent man is the films most significant character journey and a fitting personal face for the political strife that forms the storys backdrop. Part of the success of the performances in the film owes greatly to Hoopers decision to record the actors singing on set rather than have them lip-sync to pre-recorded tracks the usual method for filming musicals. The technique works exactly as intended The actors freed from having to match a vocal performance from weeks or months prior are able to live in the moment. The impact on the emotional immediacy of the songs is striking. Unfortunately if Hooper is to take credit for what that technique adds to the film he also takes the fall for failing to match that innovation visually. Too many songs are shot in long single-shot close-ups of the actor singing; the intent may have been to further showcase the performance (and to keep the actors from running out of breath -- witness Redmaynes dodgy vocal performance while forced to walk and sing during ""In My Life"") but in practice it makes the movie visually static when everything about it is constantly moving. It takes an expansive epic and stuffs it into a too-restrictive frame. The movie also suffers somewhat from the obvious skimping on digital effects. Digital backdrops and establishing shots are used frequently and none look convincing. When Javert walks the edge of the Parisian rooftops during ""Stars"" its difficult to take the danger seriously when its so obvious hes only at risk of falling onto a green screen covered over with digital images. Luckily its hard to concentrate on anything but Crowe in that moment as he delivers one of his best performances in recent memory here. Thats how it goes with the rest of the movie too as the music and the magnetic performances make many of the directorial missteps fade into the background.

"Movie review Les Miserables - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Musical epic Les Miserables runs out of steam Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 12.24.12 | 406 PM In 1862 when Victor Hugos masterpiece was published the term ""les miserables"" was meant to represent societys impoverished underdogs. They were outcasts and rebels who were rejecting societys rejection of them. But ever since 1985 when the English-language musical version began devouring the world nobody says ""Miserables."" Now its just ""Les Miz"" and that evokes an altogether different state of despair. The miz dont need food shelter or clothing -- there are catering and production crews for those. They need good lighting a stirring arrangement and an ecstatic audience. Miz is a condition of abject showmanship. Its walking to downstage and belting out your torment. Its still the same human condition that took up 1200 pages in Hugo but with razzmatazz. Whats great about the first half of Tom Hoopers gigantic film of the musical is the balance it strikes between the miserable and the miz. Hooper graduates from the tasteful and triumphant modesties of ""The Kings Speech"" to a musical that for a generation of people was a kind of first kiss. In the opening scene which is set in 1815 two decades after the French Revolution row upon row of chain-gang prisoners are pulling an enormous ship. The camera swoops to and fro taking all the gaunt hairy and chewed-up faces as they bellow their work song (""Look down Look down"") the water pouring out of their mouths as they sing. Despite some digital-production assistance this isnt a pantomime of drudgery. It feels like the real thing. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Hooper has decided that realism is the way to go with ""Les Miserables."" The singing has all been done on the spot. So if after hes been given his leave prisoner 24601 -- also known as Jean Valjean and now permanently consecrated in the movie-musical firmament as Hugh Jackman -- sounds winded as he muscles out a song in rags and clogs amid freezing temperatures at vertiginous altitudes he is. This might be the way to capture the noble suffering in Hugos novel more suffering. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below A series of benevolent events change Valjeans fortunes. Hes broken his parole (the original crime was stealing bread) changed his name and become a successful industrialist. A crisis of conscience forces him to give himself up and spend the rest of his life on the run from the beefy monomaniacal inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) but not without keeping a vow made to one of Valjeans employees the virtuous but doomed Fantine (Anne Hathaway) to find her daughter Cosette and give her a good life. Thats the first 65 minutes or so of the movie and once theyre over the action skips ahead to 1832 and things become repetitive and shallow. Some of this has to do with Hugos book whose assorted digressions in the second half are almost ruinous. But Hugo was a lyrical idealist who could pull you along with the sweep of moral principle. Neither the original French musical (by Claude-Michel Schonberg Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel) nor the English adaptation (by Herbert Kretzmer Trevor Nunn and John Caird) cares much about the greater social good. The hard decay and demise in the the first third disappear truculence and romance take over and frankly the quality of the songcraft withers. This is a sung-through musical and by the time the student revolt occupies the drama you always get the sinking feeling that the show is just spinning its wheels until the next great number. Hooper inherits the musicals problems and runs out of creative solutions. The mix of vastness and intimacy long shots and close-ups that served the film so well in the early going doesnt work as well here. Its committed to comparative trivialities the student revolt and the would-be anarchist and aristocrat Marius (Eddie Redmayne) who falls in love with Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) and breaks the heart of his pal Eponine (Samantha Barks). At this point weve already experienced the emotional payoff of Hoopers strategy of filming the solo numbers in long takes as portraits and are still mourning for Hathaway who during ""I Dreamed a Dream"" shatters apart an inch away from the camera. That moment is the implosive equivalent of the house Jennifer Hudson brought down in ""Dreamgirls."" Redmayne Seyfried and Barks whos making her movie debut are all fine. Aaron Tveit is even better as the student revolts leader. But they dont have songs that give you much to feel -- well Barks does -- and a lot of people have started singling her out. But for me her pretty singing was upstaged by her costume How does she manage to do anything with her belt that tight? The musical not unlike the book becomes guilty of Mariuss privileged sense of romance and Redmayne spends another movie looking as if hes been touched for the very first time. What makes Jackman such an astonishment is that hes not afraid to show you all the work. The live singing elevates the sense of hardship. Jackmans a star whose charisma the movies have wasted but musical theater and award shows have kept in business. Hooper often puts the camera up close to Jackman looking down upon him. What the actor reveals as he spits and weeps and strains to perform say ""What Have I Done?"" or ""Who Am I?"" is a kind of reverse showmanship. The charismas been stripped to the bone and its a thrilling confirmation of the other kind of star Jackman is. Come the second half hes just as good but theres nowhere for all the anguish to go. His hairs gone big. Hes breeches and suspenders. Its like watching ""Little House on the Prairie""-era Michael Landon tackle a supermusical. After 21/2 hours the movies become a bowl of trail mix -- youre picking out the nuts you dont like and hoping the next bite doesnt contain any craisins. All the carefully crafted miserables turns into a pile of miz. Through it all the person who breaks your heart in scene after scene is Crowe. Not because hes good. Its quite the opposite problem. Again this is a sung-through musical which means he might speak two words the entire film. He doesnt sing here so much as carry tunes -- across the desert in his bare feet. This strong virile actor is giving the songs everything he has yet still sounds like one of the orphans in ""Oliver."" The entire performance is like a car that wont turn over. His braverys commendable. But theres nothing miz about him just miserable. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris.

"Review Vive Les Miserables in all its over-the-top glory - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ActorsReview Vive Les Miserables in all its over-the-top gloryTom Hoopers Les Miserables lands with such epic scale its hard to object to the operatic-sized sentiments voiced by the compelling Hugh Jackman and others.December 24 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Hugh Jackman stars as Jean Valjean in the movie ""Les Miserables."" (Universal Pictures )The people who put ""Les MisA(c)rables"" on screen dreamed a mighty dream they really did. They dreamed of filming one of the most popular of modern theatrical musicals a 60 million tickets sold in 42 countries and 21 languages since its 1980 Paris debut a in a way that had not been done before enhancing the emotion of what was already a hugely emotional piece. And despite some built-in obstacles they succeeded to a surprising extent.The biggest obstacle to their success paradoxically was the show itself a whopper of a tale wrestled from Victor Hugos massive novel. Though the productions songs are celebrated the dialogue between them is not while the plot veers toward shameless and the characters can come off as one-dimensional.To counter all this director Tom Hooper (in his first film since the Oscar-winning ""The Kings Speech"") has doubled down on the pieces greatest strength finding ways to magnify the musicals ability to create those waves of overwhelming feelings in an audience. So if unashamed operatic-sized sentiments are not your style this ""Les Miz"" is not going to make you happy.PHOTOS Les Miserables | New York premiereWorking from a script by William Nicholson and the creators of the English-language version (Alain Boublil Claude-Michel Schonberg and Herbert Kretzmer) Hooper has first of all fearlessly opened the play up convincingly placing it in an indisputably real world. From its first scene a fantastic image of a horde of French convicts circa 1815 trying to pull a floundering ship into an enormous dry dock in the midst of a mighty storm this production is visual to the max with an epic physical scale and grandeur the play couldnt possibly have.The second strategy employed was to sign the best most convincing actors for these unsophisticated roles and to assist them in making the characters real by investing in them heart and soul. For protagonist Jean Valjean that meant the protean Hugh Jackman initially unrecognizable as a full-bearded emaciated convict a No. 24601 to be precise a who is part of the crowd wrestling with the struggling vessel.Jackmans lean and hungry look was no accident the actor has said relating that director Hooper told him ""I need you to get to where your friends stop you and ask Are you OK? Are you sick? Until you get to that point you havent gone far enough.""Also front and center in that initial scene is Javert the cold-hearted representative of the law here played by Russell Crowe an actor who pretty much defines implacable. Once the boat is safely hauled in Javert tells Valjean that after serving 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family he is being released albeit to a life of constantly being marked as a dangerous ex-convict. ""Do not forget my name"" Javert says to the man as if that were even an option.VIDEO The Envelope Screening Series | Les MiserablesExcept Crowes Javert doesnt say it he sings it right there in front of us. Perhaps the key change Hooper made in the way movie musicals are usually put together is his insistence that the singing the audience hears is the actors performing live on the set at the time of filming not weeks earlier in a recording studio. That allows them to bring the rich emotion of their entire performances to celebrated songs such as ""Who Am I"" and ""One Day More.""Hooper believes as he told an early Los Angeles screening audience that ""singing gives access to a deeper emotional range"" but that doesnt mean that this was in any way easy. The director revealed that the actors wore two radio microphones outside their costumes so that no matter which way their heads turned the sound would be accurately recorded. All that remained was to ""digitally paint them out"" frame by frame by frame.All that painstaking work was definitely worthwhile making the singing as intense and personal as possible something that pays off as ""Les MisA(c)rables"" way melodramatic plot gets increasingly wild and crazy.The scene now shifts to 1823 and a town in France where helped by a kindly bishop (Colm Wilkinson the original London and Broadway Valjean) and his own decision to break parole Valjean has taken on a new identity and become a wealthy factory owner. Easy street however is about to end.For one thing Javert turns up in town and he smells a rat. For another one of Valjeans female employees Fantine is wrongfully sacked and ends up selling her hair and her teeth and becoming a prostitute. Though this series of events practically defines over-the-top plotting Anne Hathaway who plays Fantine does such a knockout rendition of the showstopper ""I Dreamed a Dream"" that objecting is out of the question.PHOTOS Hollywood back lot moments1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESLes Miserables headed back to Broadway in 2014February 20 2013Golden Globes 2013 Hugh Jackman Daniel Day-Lewis win...January 13 2013Les Miz Hugh Jackman prepped with weights washcloths...December 27 2012Oscar 8-Ball Tom Hoopers Les MiserablesDecember 20 2012Les Miserables Scary undertaking for Hugh Jackman Anne...December 18 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTActorsMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-les-miserables-20121225,0,7403253.story",200,lesmiserables(2012)12,lesmiserables(2012),latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a great meta moment early in Tom Hoopers film adaptation of the 80s Broadway musical Les Miserables based on Victor Hugos 1862 French novel. After 19 years of hard labor for stealing a loaf of bread and trying to escape his sentence convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is paroled but starving because no one will hire or help a known criminal. Then a bishop at a rural church takes him in and shows him profound kindness getting him back on his feet and imbuing him with a moral code that profoundly shapes the rest of his life. The bishop is played by Colm Wilkinson who originated the Jean Valjean role on Broadway and played him for more than 15 years including on both the original London cast album and the original Broadway cast album. The scene between them--where the older man surrenders the most valuable things he owns to give the younger one a fresh start in life--is highly symbolic a generous respectful passing of the musical torch. But in spite of this clever bit of theater Les Miserables the movie is unlikely to supplant the long-running stage show in the minds of anyone whos seen both. While not a disgrace to Wilkinsons good name Hoopers film is critically flawed in a variety of ways. The story follows Valjean beginning with his prisoner days when hes watched over by the morally uncompromising Javert (Russell Crowe) who believes once a criminal always a criminal. When Valjean decides to break his parole and assume a new identity he becomes a wealthy successful man but Javert remains on his trail distracting him at a moment that proves critical for Valjeans workshop employee Fantine (Anne Hathaway). Later Valjean adopts Fantines young daughter Cosette after dealing with her ruthless innkeeper caretakers the Thenardiers (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) and moves with her to Paris. Years later all these players meet again amid the tumult of a student uprising led by the hot-blooded Enjolras (Aaron Tveit). Enjolras friend Marius (Eddie Redmayne) falls for the grown-up Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) the Thenardiers daughter Eponine (Samantha Barks) pines for Marius and a great deal of angst and anger is expressed through song on the way to a series of bloody confrontations. Theres a great deal of grandeur and emotional sweep to all this painful emotion and Hoopers greatest failure in directing it is an intermittent unwillingness to trust the raw power of the material or his richly appointed setting. Content with steadier soberer camera work in The Damned United and The Kings Speech (which won him a Best Director Oscar) he repeatedly chops Les Miserables setpieces into disorienting fragments seen from a crazed variety of angles. Its most irritating on ""At The End Of The Day"" an early ensemble number meant to establish the desperate circumstances of the poor and the apathy or outright malice of the wealthy. Hooper stages the first half of the song in a corridor full of ragged filthy peasants but cuts rapidly around his staging seemingly at random abandoning the songs meter and zooming through a variety of angles and POVs jumping in on faces and then away never establishing a rhythm or a sense of space. It isnt dazzling just distracting and visually confusing. On other songs his camera swoops and soars over the performers with giddy show-offy abandon. But for some of the musicals signature numbers the evocative weepies that most often get pulled out for performances and auditions he zooms in uncomfortably close and leaves the camera to sit still and intimately explore the singers faces always positioned on the right of the screen for some reason. It would be an effective tactic if he didnt repeat the same idiosyncratic move over and over. Hooper has gotten a lot of publicity for his tactic of live singing letting his cast act their way through scenes at their own pace songs and all then later adding an orchestra timed to their recorded performances. Its a daring experimental tactic that pays off with some performances and becomes embarrassing with others. Crowe looks like hes concentrating hard to make it through Javerts two character-defining numbers with dignity and he never makes the musical numbers work for his role. He delivers them forcefully at an unseen audience like hes performing in concert onstage rather than expressing an integral part of his characters being and his limited voice doesnt help. Jackman is a fine singer and performer but shades into drawn-out hamminess in a role thats already sometimes parodically bombastic. And he too often falls into recitative as he tries to push emotions past the song instead of bringing them into the song. But for others the method pays off brilliantly. Barks a longtime Eponine stage vet making her film debut brings across her character handsomely and with just the right air of sweet sad resigned longing. Seyfried is appropriately syrupy as Cosette and Redmayne (the male ingenue of My Week With Marilyn playing a similarly doe-eyed naif with just a bit more spine here) works with both of them extremely well with a perfect blend of bravado and vulnerability. Theater vet Tveit plays Enjolras with passion and clarity in particular turning the second-act number ""Red And Black"" from an expository tool into a war of ideals in which he repeatedly wins over his less-committed brethren. Given that all this talent is concentrated in the second act when the story focuses less on Valjean and Javert the film does build in strength and focus through the second half though Redmayne makes more of a climax out of ""Empty Chairs At Empty Tables"" than Hooper does with the stirring reprise of the final number. But for better and worse the film belongs to Hathaway who sobs her way through the now-standard ""I Dreamed A Dream"" almost entirely in a single mesmerizing take thats guaranteed to get her attention when Oscar season rolls around. Her raw gasping version does the songs beauty no favors but her emotion is so unprotected so wrenching and desperate that it feels like the crew filming her was holding its collective breath the entire time aware they were seeing something authentic and afraid to break the spell. The sequence has a naked ugliness that nothing else in the film can match but while it doesnt fully integrate it sets a high bar for performance that the film only periodically reaches again. The problem is that so little about Hoopers Les Miserables feels integrated. The cast feels like a grab bag of talented stage vets and garish stunt-casting choices particularly Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter who perform the fan-favorite comic number ""Master Of The House"" as a jerky staccato series of show-off moves and attempted but inadequate scene-stealing. (The worst choice in the entire film is Baron Cohen inexplicably adopting an exaggerated French accent even though the story takes place in France and no one else has an accent let alone an erratic silly comic one.) They both resemble Eddie Izzard in Across The Universe flailing without respect for the music or comedic timing. Meanwhile Jackman is performing in a drama Crowe on his concert stage and Hathaway alone in her room. Its a collection of performances rather than a story. All of which raises the question of whether Hoopers live-singing method went too far in letting the actors make their own choices at the films expense or whether Hooper was focusing so much on making each number into a definitive experience that he lost track of the big picture. Interviews with Hooper and the cast have emphasized the methods freedom and spontaneity but freedom in the moment clearly isnt the most important factor in building a consistent world. What Hooper wound up with isnt definitive or coherent but at least it has some elegant and memorable high points and a new opportunity to work on its own merit with every new segment. As with the old saw about the weather viewers who dont like it only need to wait; theyll get something new and different within a few minutes.

Matt Gillmer Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint After decades of promises and delays the musical version of ""Les Miserables"" has arrived and it was worth every minute of the wait. Tom Hooper (""The Kings Speech"") marries propulsive character-driven drama to scenes of jaw-dropping spectacle and tender intimacy. The Broadway scores indelible songs recorded live on set by a dream cast have a dizzying electric immediacy no studio-tuned rendition could equal. Victor Hugos tale of abject squalor and undying love calamitous mobs and barricades idealistic self-sacrifice and cold moralism has become a film of almost inexpressible beauty. We know the story of course. In 19th-century France fugitive convict Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) brutalized by two decades at hard labor for stealing a loaf of bread reforms after a soul-stirring encounter with a kindly priest. He becomes a pillar of his community and when his onetime worker Fantine (Anne Hathaway) dies in disgrace he takes her faraway daughter Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) as his own. But he lives in fear that implacable Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) will see through his respectable new identity and return him to prison. The movie isnt a tear factory. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter have a boisterous music-hall energy as Cosettes cunning guardians tearing up the scenery with irresistible comic brio. The overall tone though is drama played straight. Valjean has to crawl through a lot of sewage literal and moral to survive. The duets between Jackman singing high from the head and Crowe rumbling from the chest define their characters swiftly and powerfully. Each man is sealed off one by secrets the other by rigid ethics yet the actors convey volumes with a glance or a note. The cast is inspired delivering showstopping arias in tight sustained closeups. The death scenes here are fulsomely emotional -- shattering frankly -- but never cross the line into kitsch. Its a high-risk/high-reward gamble that pays off handsomely. The players never milk the moment for pathos. They dont need to. The piercing sincerity of this stupendous heart-wrenching epic would move even the most jaded cynic. See it and weep.

"Les Miserables (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Les Miserables (PG-13) Director Tom Hooper does justice to the grand insanely popular musical stage play. Share Print Save to your profile By Christine Dolen cdolenMiamiHerald.com12/24/2012 Editor rating 3 Transforming a hit musical into a movie is never simple even if the show is as beloved as Les Miserables. Producer Cameron Mackintosh tried in the late 1980s after Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublils musical version of the classic 1862 Victor Hugo novel became a massive hit in London and on Broadway. But the cameras didnt start rolling until last March 27 years after Les Miz first hit the London stage. Hard to say how an earlier Les Miz movie might have worked out but for fans director Tom Hoopers interpretation of a theater classic is worth the wait. The movie is visually stunning expansive yet intimate. Its true to the style and spirit of the musical in telling the story of Jean Valjean the hero who transforms his life after 19 years of hard labor for stealing a loaf of bread. William Nicholson (Shadowlands Gladiator) gets credit for the screenplay along with Herbert Kretzmer who transformed Boublils original French lyrics into the now-familiar English ones. Theres even a new song Suddenly sung by Valjean to reflect his altered life after he rescues the waif Cosette. The story of Valjean and the socio-political turmoil of early 19th century France is told through song. Star Hugh Jackman Oscar winner Russell Crowe as his dogged pursuer Javert and the other actors have little or no spoken dialogue. One song leads into the next more in the style of an opera than a musical. And as on stage the actors sing the music live. Les Miz evokes the grandeur and grittiness of France from Valjeans release in 1815 to the aftermath of the student rebellion of 1832. The opening sequence is a stunner with dozens of men singing Look Down as they trudge through frigid water to haul a massive ship into dry dock. The imperious Javert (Crowe) hands a worn-out Valjean (Jackman) paperwork granting him freedom but in truth hes branded for life. The story becomes an extended cat-and-mouse chase once Valjean breaks his parole and Javert begins his deadly pursuit. Javert the ""righteous"" man follows the letter of the law (and Valjean) to extremes; Valjean transformed after an act of mercy by the Bishop of Digne (Colm Wilkinson the original stage Valjean) has become a righteous compassionate man. His life intersects with myriad others throughout Les Miz. Fantine (a radiant and heartbreaking Anne Hathaway) who toils to support her illegitimate daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen) sheds her dignity bit by bit finally turning to prostitution. Valjean assures the dying woman hell look after her daughter and after retrieving Cosette from the clutches of abusive innkeepers Monsieur and Madame Thenardier (a grime-covered Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter) he raises the little girl as his own. Nine years later as the rebellion is brewing in a majestic Paris a love triangle forms. Eponine (earthy newcomer Samantha Barks) the Thenardiers once-pampered daughter is mad for the handsome student Marius (Eddie Redmayne). But he falls instantly in love with the grown Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) who is equally smitten. Marius begins using Eponine as a go-between and the Heart Full of Love trio sung by Seyfried Redmayne and Barks is exquisitely beautiful. The climactic battle at the students hodgepodge barricade is bloody and shocking. Closeups are part of the difference as we watch the predictable results of soldiers mowing down the rag-tag band and their leader Enjolras (Aaron Tveit). The sad fate of plucky little Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone) becomes almost unbearable. Jackman is almost wizened-looking yet convincing as Valjean hitting the right acting notes. He has plenty of stage singing experience but hes best when he sings full out as he does on the confessional Who Am I?  The softer prayerful passages of Bring Him Home arent nearly as effective. Musically Valjean demands an operatic strength and range that the appealing Jackman doesnt possess. Likewise Crowe who has fronted his own rock band brings a strong baritone to Javerts Stars and Soliloquy but his acting trumps his singing. Hooper has honored a much-loved stage musical while opening it up visually and casting it with names that should help sell tickets. Les Miz purists may not be happy and those who dont dig classics and/or musicals wont go. But the director delivers an engaging version of a sweeping epic an enduring tale of romance sacrifice and heroism.

Universal Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1121 a.m. EST December 26 2012A tender transcendent and powerfully stirring adaptation of the longest-running stage musical is both old-fashioned and daring and an ideal holiday season offeringAnne Hathaways I Dreamed a Dream is a showstopper.(Photo Laurie Sparham Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourRated PG-13 for suggestive and sexual material violence and thematic elementsOpens Christmas Day nationwideVictor Hugos grim but redemptive classic novel is given resplendent new life on the big screen.Les Miserables (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Christmas Day nationwide) is sweeping as would be expected given the scope of the hugely popular stage musical from which it is adapted. But its also wonderfully intimate thanks to Tom Hoopers deft direction.Hooper (The Kings Speech) was a perfect match for the material making exquisite use of a much bigger stage and impeccable production design for a wonderfully epic effect juxtaposed with stirring tight close-ups.Theres a heightened accessibility to the iconic story in the way that Hooper zeroes in on the emotional performances of Anne Hathaway superb as the tragic Fantine and Hugh Jackman masterful as Jean Valjean imprisoned for almost 20 years for stealing a loaf of bread. Its far and away Jackmans finest screen role.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) questions his own actions. Both Hathaway and Jackman strike perfect notes in their performances which are nearly entirely sung. The film is essentially an operetta with every character singing his or her lines in predominantly live vocals done on set -- not dubbed in later. The result is a collection of astounding voices.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) and Marius (Eddie Redmayne) meet for the first time.

Newcomer Samantha Barks is heartbreakingly soulful as Eponine whose love for Marius is not returned. Russell Crowe as the self-righteous police inspector Javert strains somewhat with the singing but his portrayal is appropriately forbidding.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Le Miserable actress Samantha Barks answers five questions for USA TODAY. By Rene Alston and Todd Plitt STORY Samantha Barks is odd one out in Les Mis love triangleINTERVIEW Seyfried and Redmayne talk about playing star-crossed loversThe story which spans 1815 to the French rebellion of 1832 is a simple but enthralling tale of love idealism and sacrifice. Valjean is released from slave labor and inspired to turn his life around after a priest treats him with kindness and dignity. He becomes a successful businessman and mayor but the relentless Javert is hot on his trail for violating parole. Valjean is deeply moved by the plight of Fantine who works in his factory but loses her job and is forced to sell her hair teeth and body.

But all the while Javert lurks eager to bring down Valjean.What distinguishes Les Mis and makes it so vibrant on-screen is Hoopers risky choice to have the cast sing live wearing earpieces so they could hear a piano for tempo. (The orchestral arrangement was added later.) The singing is often appropriately raw (particularly in Fantines dying scene) which intensifies already poignant performances.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Tom Hooper director of the film Les Miserables answers five questions for USA TODAY.

The Kings Speech a runaway success. Slideshow Les Mis will please its legions Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Les Miserables >> There is certainly no stammering to be had or heard in Les Miserables Hoopers sweeping adaptation of the Broadway musical and destined one suspects for box-office glory too. Based on Victor Hugos hefty classic and given an operetta treatment that can be soaring and glorious - or when the lyrics slip into anachronistic vernacular wincingly lame - this big-budget movie musical summons the mighty forces of CGI to create vast tableaux of castles and monasteries shipyards and slums France in the tumultuous first half of the 19th century. Les Miserables also summons the mighty tonsils of Hugh Jackman the multitasking Australian in the role of Jean Valjean. A prisoner hounded for decades by Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe another Aussie) Valjean undergoes a spiritual transformation - and a change of identity - becoming a successful factory owner and all-round benevolent guy. When one of his workers Fantine (the scene-stealing Anne Hathaway) loses her job and ends up on the street and then in a brothel Valjean belatedly tries to make amends promising to watch over Fantines waif of a child Cosette. Cue ""Come to Me"" ""Fantines Death"" and ""The Confrontation."" No Javert will not go away With its scenes of rebellious throngs mounting barricades to fight off army troops and with its roving beggars and emaciated citizens dodging rats in the streets Les Miserables can be read - and observed - as the June Rebellion version of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The music is catchier though. Hooper had his actors - Jackman Crowe Hathaway Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) Eddie Redmayne (Marius) Helena Bonham Carter (Madame Thenardier although she could just as well be Mrs. Lovett from Sweeney Todd) and all - wailing their numbers as they act and recording them live on the set which isnt usually the case with Hollywood musicals. There does seem to be an extra edge of immediacy to the performances though Crowe - who moonlights in a rock band from time to time - has a range thats as limited as his facial expressions here. That is he scowls. If you love Les Mis the stage musical my guess is you will love what Hooper and his bustling company have done. But when you hear ""Master of the House"" and you think of the Seinfeld episode with Elaines gruff dad belting the tune before you think of those shifty innkeepers the Thenardiers then you may want to steer clear of this grand endeavor.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The smash-hit musical about love law and the Paris Uprising comes to the big screen. BOTTOM LINE Jackmans powerhouse performance carries this movie which hits emotional heights but skimps on spectacle and grandeur. Its about three-quarters of the big event it should be. CAST Hugh Jackman Russell Crowe Anne Hathaway LENGTH 238 The place is France the year is 1815 and Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is one of several dozen men grunting in chorus on a massive prison ship. The music swells the waves pound and ""Les Miserables"" clearly promises to deliver a grand glorious widescreen version of the long-running stage musical. That however is the last scene of its kind in ""Les Miserables"" which steadily diminishes in scale as it goes along. This is a big story with big themes based on Victor Hugos really big novel about love law and revolution in 19th-century France. Yet somehow ""Les Miserables"" isnt the major movie event it should be. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? You cant blame the all-singing all-great-looking cast. Jackman is flat-out incredible wringing every drop of agony from numbers like ""What Have I Done?"" while Anne Hathaway as the battered seamstress Fantine uses her shimmering eyes as much as her voice to conquer the shows signature song ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried as young lovers mesh nicely; Samantha Barks as third-wheel Eponine movingly reprises her London stage role. Theres only scant comic relief from Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as scurrilous innkeepers but the weakest link is Russell Crowe as the merciless law enforcer Inspector Javert. Crowes physical intensity is impressive but his airy voice is noticeably weak -- odd for an actor who has fronted a couple of rock bands. The main problem is director Tom Hooper who films each musical number almost without exception in close-up. Hooper bets everything on his actors a strategy that earned him an Oscar for ""The Kings Speech."" But he forgets the overall sense of well theater needed to adapt a musical like this one. ""Les Miserables"" works fine as a movie but falls just short of spectacle. 137 VideoTrailer Les Miserables PLOT The smash-hit musical about love law and the Paris Uprising comes to the big screen. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (brief sexuality mild violence) CAST Hugh Jackman Russell Crowe Anne Hathaway LENGTH 238 BOTTOM LINE Jackmans powerhouse performance carries this movie which hits emotional heights but skimps on spectacle and grandeur.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""Les Miserables"" Victor Hugos 19th century historical novel and the behemoth long-running musical based on it the question raised again and again is not an obvious one. Because it doesnt really concern the heros transformation. No the question isnt will the ex-convict Jean Valjean remain a changed soul? Instead the quandary is will Javert the man who hunts him obsessively recognize in Valjeans transformation an opportunity for his own redemption? Director Tom Hoopers lavish yet gritty big-screen adaptation of the Tony-winning musical opening Tuesday stars Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe as Valjean and Javert respectively. And the British director wields a decidedly visual language -- vast and intimate -- to tell the story of the nemeses the ill-fated factory worker turned prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway) and her wee daughter Cosette. Jackman is in his element here mastering the space where acting and singing meet head on. He brings depth to Valjeans tale of offense and grace of taking responsibility for a child and then letting go. Jackman makes Valjeans epiphanies aches and doubts real. Late in the movie his rendition of ""Bring Him Home"" has narrative heft moving Valjean from fatherly rival to champion of his daughters true love. We meet Valjean shortly before his release from a chain gang. It is a few years since the French Revolution and its quickly clear that little wealth has trickled down to the masses the poor les miserables. Valjean was imprisoned for failing (or not) the sort of dilemma rudimentary ethics classes like to pose Would you break the law to help your starving sister and her child? He would and did. And so Valjean served five years for stealing a loaf of bread and another 14 for escape attempts. As he departs head of the guards Javert promises him hell if he violates parole. Like so many ex-convicts Valjean returns to a suspicious society. A bishop (Colm Wilkinson) shows him compassion. Valjean disappoints us more than the bishop when he steals from the convent. If you wonder how this often-grim adaptation of Hugos socially thoughtful if romantic novel finds itself opening in theaters on Christmas Day you need look no further than the meeting of Valjean and the bishop who strikes a subtle Christian bargain with Valjean. ""Why settle for these trinkets my son have you forgotten these valuable candlesticks? Use them to better yourself and live a generous life"" is the Christian bargain. ""What Have I Done?"" sings an anguished and renewed Valjean. Only no one sent Javert the memo. So begins one of the great hunts in literature. Valjeans every decency is met by Javerts righteousness. The inspectors singleminded adherence to the law becomes its own form of villainy. They first meet again in Montreuil-sur-Mer where Valjean owns a factory and has become the towns benevolent mayor. He has taken the name Monsieur Madeleine. Hathaway brings a radiance and sorrow to Fantine the onetime employee Valjean aids too late to save -- but not too late to become caretaker to her child. When the action relocates to Paris nine years later Amanda Seyfried plays Cosette. Its a wan performance amid more robust turns. Its as if Valjean protected his beloved ward so much she lacks any signs of the hard-won grit of her dead mother or her adoptive father. Indeed you may find yourself rooting for the more destitute Eponine (Samantha Barks) who hankers for Marius the student revolutionary. Marius and Cosettes love-at-first-sight story rings tinny next to Hugos grander themes of justice and grace. Eddie Redmayne with his smattering of freckles and wide inviting mouth appeals as the well-off radicalized student Marius. But his object of affection seems less inspiring than the ideals that send he friend Enjolras (Aaron Tveit) and their fellow students to the barricades. The students provide two of the films finest songs the gorgeous anthem ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" and the ballad of camaraderie sung on the eve of a bloody street battle ""Drink With Me."" When Marius returns to the scene of so much carnage he sings the lovely and mournful ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" Through out the saga Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter take sleazy delight in their roles as Thenardier and Madame Thenardier the innkeepers who fleeced Fantine as they cared for the child Cosette. Hooper and his team which includes the original creators of the musical behemoth (producer Cameron Mackintosh and composer Claude-Michel Schonberg among them) have hewed to the sung-through form. Further adding to the challenge and texture of the undertaking Hooper had the actors sing live.The result is not always pretty. Far from being a problem this adds to the movies force. There is real exertion going on here. Much will be made of Crowes capable but hardly astounding singing. The notes the actor doesnt hit in song he captures in his face. Javert is the only one that doesnt know how wounded he is by his past how out of tune with Frances future he is.

Les Miserables By Peter Travers December 21 2012 More News The Best Movies of 2012 All Stories >> No one expects gutsy filmmaking in a musical. But thats just what Kings Speech Oscar winner Tom Hooper delivers in Les Miserables. The massive 1980s stage smash is adapted from Victor Hugos even more massive 1862 novel spun around the 1832 Paris student uprising. Theres no spoken dialogue Everyone sings All the time For nearly three hours Think rock opera like the Whos Tommy. If that drives you nuts screw off and see the stupid Twilight finale again. More News The Best Movies of 2012 All Stories >> What helps make Les Miserables so vibrant and thrilling onscreen is Hoopers daring decision to have his actors sing live. No mouthing the words to prerecorded songs. The actors wore earpieces to hear a piano give them tempo. A 70-piece orchestra was added later to bring out the beauty and thunder in the score by Claude-Michel Schonberg Alain Boublil and Herbert Kretzmer. The risk pays off. The singing isnt slick. It sometimes sounds raw and roughed up which is all to the good. It sure as hell brings out the best in the actors. A never-better Hugh Jackman stars as Jean Valjean locked up for nearly 20 years for stealing a loaf of bread. The convict known as 24601 escapes and makes a respectable life for himself as a small-town mayor. But he cant rest. Hunted relentlessly by the policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) Valjean is almost caught again when he tries to help poor doomed Fantine (Anne Hathaway) a factory girl who sells her hair her teeth and her body to support her child Cosette. A dynamite Hathaway shatters every heart when she sings how ""life has killed the dream I dreamed."" Her volcanic performance has Oscar written all over it. Its up to Valjean to save Cosette from the clutches of the Thenardiers greedy innkeepers who treat Cosette like a slave while spoiling their daughter Eponine. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter play this gruesome twosome with delicious mirth and malice. But Valjean has a job to do raising the grown Cosette (a sublime Amanda Seyfried) and worrying about her falling for Marius (Eddie Redmayne) a handsome student rebel who also has Eponine (a wondrous Samantha Barks) pining vainly for his love. Look Im out of breath squeezing in all this plot and sometimes so is the movie. Plot exposition is even harder when you sing it and I havent even gotten into the student revolt yet or the heroic part played in it by the street urchin Gavroche (scene-stealing 12-year-old Daniel Huttlestone) and the student leader Enjolras (a stirring Aaron Tveit). But Hoopers cast is up for every challenge. Jackman and Hathaway are Academy all the way. And Crowe who did The Rocky Horror Picture Show onstage in his youth brings lonely grandeur to Javerts anthem ""Stars."" Redmayne also deserves a piece of the awards pie for the soulful ache he brings to the love story and his lost brothers (""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables""). Besides being a feast for the eyes and ears Les Miserables overflows with humor heartbreak rousing action and ravishing romance. Damn the imperfections its perfectly marvelous.

"Les Miserables review More desperate than miserable | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLes Miserables review More desperate than miserableLes Miserables sings desperately for its Oscar supper.A harrowing Anne Hathaway and a strained Hugh Jackman in Les Miserables.  (Universal Studios)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 21 2012 Les Miserables (out of 4) Starring Hugh Jackman Russell Crowe Anne Hathaway Eddie Redmayne Amanda Seyfried Sacha Baron Cohen Helena Bonham Carter and Samantha Barks. Directed by Tom Hooper. 151 minutes. Opens Christmas Day at major theatres. PG Les Miserables sings so desperately for its Oscar supper it makes you want to scoop it up in your arms like Jean Valjean cradling the wretched Fantine. Almost every member of the cast wails for dear life and for Academy honours. Has there ever been a movie that so nakedly sought the comfort of the little golden man? Im sure there has been but the thought has been momentarily blasted from my brain by director Tom Hoopers assault to the senses his follow-up to The Kings Speech being more appropriately thought of as The Ka-chings Screech. Multiplexes will doubtless be filled come Christmas Day when this latest of many iterations of Victor Hugos 150-year-old drama of post-Revolution 19th-century France once again sends Kleenex sales soaring. And youd be a fool to bet against the Oscar chances of Les Miserables packed as it is with A-list stars and aching tonsils Hugh Jackman Anne Hathaway Russell Crowe Amanda Seyfried and Helena Bonham Carter among them. The Academy loves a good agony. At least one golden kiss would be richly deserved. Hathaways all-too-brief turn as the ill-fated Fantine the single mom who turns prostitute to save her sweet daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen as a child Seyfried as an adult) is both an eye dabber and eye opener. Hathaways quavering soprano take on ""I Dreamed a Dream"" the one true show-stopper amongst the earnest tunes by composer Claude-Michel Schonberg and lyricists Alain Boublil and Herbert Kretzmer is one rare moment when the film seems more blessed than bombastic. She momentarily justifies Hoopers much-ballyhooed decision to have his players warble straight to his probing camera without resorting to overdubs and other sonic tricks. This is a sung-through musical that is also intended to be suffered through and Hathaway delivers on that in all the best ways. Her performance could bring a tear to a glass eye and will surely be amongst Best Supporting Actress nominees when Oscar greets the new year. But alas its just a few scant ticks of the 151-minute tock of Les Miserables. Most of the rest of the Les Miz cast as game as they all surely are will have to rely on Oscars mercy getting ""A"" for effort rather than execution. Chief among this lot is Jackman whose acting and singing skills are great yet who visibly strains his natural tenor to hit the high notes of some difficult and unmelodic tunes. The film begins almost immediately on a false note with Jackmans emaciated and water-logged Valjean toiling in a prison ship conjured by lousy CGI. The year is 1815 some 26 years after the start of the French Revolution and noble unfortunate Valjean is finishing a 19-year stint in the slammer -- five years for stealing a loaf of bread to feed starving family members another 14 for repeated attempts at escape. The latter has earned him the lasting ire of warden Javert (Crowe bravely braying) who vows to keep an eye on him. Hooper is stingy with the escape action scenes foregoing a chance to open the picture up and relieve the relentless close-ups he indulges in possibly to save money on sets rather than as any kind of artistic statement. Jump eight years to 1823 and the city of Montreuil where Valjean is now a prosperous factory owner thanks to the assistance of a wise old bishop (Colm Wilkinson who first played Valjean on Broadway). Valjean wants to do right by his workers but momentary inattention leads to a cascade of problems for a host of characters and renewed scrutiny by Javert who is now a police inspector. Unlucky Fantine is cast into the cold and grimy streets where she struggles to reclaim Cosette from the greedy mitts of her childs supposed caregivers M. and Mme. Thenardier (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). The Thenardiers run a filthy inn that is straight out of Tim Burtons Sweeney Todd -- a film that not so coincidentally Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter co-starred in. These two grand hams provide one of the few comic moments of Les Miserables as they duet on ""Master of the House"" as Grand Guignol by way of Oliver But this is not a movie about fun nor is it much about romance. Valjean develops paternal and platonic love for Cosette who grows into a beauty sought by the determined Marius (Eddie Redmayne) an upstart toff who will help lead the 1832 Paris uprising in the films final abrupt shift of time and place -- and also volume. Marius doesnt realize that hes the unrequited heartthrob of the Thenardiers tragic daughter Eponine who is played by Samantha Barks returning to a role she played for a year in a West End version of Les Miz. Barks is easily the best singer in the film and not a bad actress besides and watching her ace her rain-drenched lament ""On My Own"" makes you wonder if Hooper might not have been wiser to just do a quality lensing of a good stage production of Les Miserables. Why reinvent the guillotine? Its not like Hooper wants to stray that far from the stage anyway having declined to use any of the widescreen advantages that cinema offers. Instead he gives us a film thankfully not in 3D containing oceans of tears trickles of blood tonsils of tension and eyes aimed beseechingly at tiny golden Oscar begging his pardon and his pity. Will Oscar turn away those who are so desperately needful of his love?

"Les Miserables (2012) | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; les-miserables-2012 ) Les Miserables (2012) (United Kingdom 2012) December 21 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Les Miserables believed by some to be the best novel ever penned in French has been adapted in nearly every form imaginable including dozens of movies television mini-series in French and English loose ""thematic reworkings"" and comic books. But Victor Hugos epic historical drama is perhaps best known for its musical version which opened in the West End in 1985 and bowed on Broadway two years later. A motion picture interpretation of this lavish production has been in the works since the early 1990s but as it churned in development hell no less than three major non-musical adaptations of Les Miserables were made - Claude Lelouchs remarkable 1995 re-imagination a major 1998 English-language version directed by Bille August and starring Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush and a celebrated 2000 French mini-series featuring Gerard Depardieu and John Malkovich. The musical motion picture finally gained traction in 2011 when The Kings Speechs director Tom Hooper came on board. Now twenty years after the earliest attempts to make the movie it has reached the screen. Fans of the stage version will not be disappointed. While successfully ""opening up"" the musical far beyond the limitations of a theater-bound production Hooper retains its heart and soul. In many ways the movie is more opera than musical. Theres very little dancing and even less spoken dialogue. Most of the lines are sung recitative-style and the arias often focus in close-up on the singers face. Les Miserables understandably cuts some of the stage productions numbers but all of the major anthems are intact and wonderfully presented. There is one new song included in large part for Oscar eligibility. Visually Les Miserables is a splendid spectacle with set and costume design unparalleled in any 2012 period piece including its chief rival in those categories Lincoln. Hooper does an excellent job recreating 19th century France and its in this area that the motion picture separates itself from the live version. What it lacks in the intimacy of singers performing directly to an audience it gains in cinematic achievement. When Les Miserables debuted in the West End in 1985 many Hugo purists were horrified. Of necessity the narrative was stripped down and condensed. To the extent that this can be considered a flaw it is maintained in the movie. Pacing is also uneven with the first two-thirds (up to what would have been the intermission if there was one) more emotionally involving than the final third. The battle at the barricade is not Les Miserables most compelling sequence. The story begins in 1815 France where Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is being freed from prison after serving a 19-year sentence for the theft of a loaf of bread. After breaking his parole and deciding to live a good life he changes his name to avoid the dogged pursuit of Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) who is obsessed with bringing Valjean to justice. Eight years later he has become a wealthy factory owner and mayor in the town of Montfermeil. While there he risks exposure to Javert by saving a prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway) from arrest. Fantine is mortally ill however but before she dies Valjean agrees to care for her young daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen). When Javert gets close Valjean must again disappear this time with Cosette posing as his adopted daughter. Nearly a decade later back in Paris a now-adult Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) falls in love with a revolutionary Marius (Eddie Redmayne). Their chance at happiness however is complicated by three factors the interference of Eponine (Samantha Barks) a young woman who suffers unrequited love for Marius; a city-wide uprising that is ruthlessly crushed by the military; and Valjeans own misgivings about losing Cosette to marriage. The performances are as good as advertised and even the weakest singers Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are better than one might expect. Everyone sings their own lines and Hooper employs the unconventional approach of having the songs recorded live (rather than pre-recording them and having the actors lip synch during filming). Considering how little spoken dialogue there is this makes abundant sense. None of the actors suffers the indignity of being overdubbed by a more accomplished performer. Marni Nixons participation was not required. Two performances are locks to receive Oscar consideration. Hugh Jackmans work as Jean Valjean a good man who has done bad things and is seeking redemption is multifaceted and arresting. He plays Valjean successfully as the scraggly thin prisoner we see in the opening scene and as a much older man. He has the pipes for the songs. Anne Hathaway has a strong chance in the weak Best Supporting Actress category for her work as Fantine. Not only is her singing better than expected but this is the most accomplished acting she has ever done. This is an instance in which an actor has raised her game to meet the demands of the role. As Javert Russell Crowe is surprisingly understated. His singing is workmanlike but not likely to be overpraised. Amanda Seyfried and Eddie Redmayne (the male lead in My Week with Marilyn) are also good although both are better singers than actors at least insofar as this production is concerned. The two weak spots are Cohen and Carter who play Monsieur and Madame Thenardier. Their voices are not up to the high standards set by the rest of the cast. And although both are excellent at oozing odiousness their overly broad interpretations of the characters seem a little out-of-place. (This is the kind of thing that works better on stage than on screen.) The filmmakers have made every attempt to pay homage to Les Miserables long screen history. The ""original"" Jean Valjean Colm Wilkinson has a not insignificant part as The Bishop of Digne. Another initial cast member Frances Ruffelle has a cameo as a prostitute. Samantha Barks who was Eponine for a year in the London stage production (as well as in the 25th Anniversary concert) reprises the role here. Additionally many of the tertiary characters are played by those who appeared at one time or another on stage. In keeping with the storys serious tone Hooper does not attempt to ""out-spectacle"" other recent high profile musicals like Chicago Dreamgirls and Nine. Instead he draws inspiration as much from the source material as from the musical. The result is an engaging production that is guaranteed to enthrall audiences and become a holiday season commercial success. 20 years may have been a long time to wait for this motion picture but with this result who can dispute that it was worth it?

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 21 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 20 2012 454PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Tom Hooper Written by William Nichols Claude-Michel Schonberg (music) Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel (libretto) with Herbert Kretzmer (English lyrics) and Victor Hugo (novel) Starring Hugh Jackman Anne Hathaway and Russell Crowe Classification PG Country USA Language English ""Look down Look down"" intone the prisoners in the opening musical number of Les Miserables a scene that begins underwater and moves to a crane shot of hundreds of inmates pulling ropes to haul an up-ended ship to dock.The same phrase could describe the condescension many filmgoers and serious theatre buffs held for bloated eighties supermusicals (Cats The Phantom of the Opera Miss Saigon) that were turned into a global brand by English producer Cameron Mackintosh. Each musical features a story of love and sacrifice a handful of memorable tear-jerking tunes and a ponderous stage trick a falling chandelier; a descending helicopter; a revolving turntable stage. Hugh Jackman Movies Video Hugh Jackman takes a risk with Les Miserables Watch Les Miserables official trailer Les Miserables (the one with the revolutionary turntable) is the most enduring and best pedigreed of the lot. In the past 150 years Victor Hugos 1862 novel has spun into stage adaptations radio dramas and more than 60 large and small-screen adaptations. Hugos novel provides the mine of source material starting with a rattling good man-hunt tale (The Fugitive is one of its offshoots) it throws in dollops of pathos and a call to the barricades that at once thrills the jewellery-rattling 1-per-centers and inspires the passion of the Occupy Movement. As historian Mark Traugott wrote in The Insurgent Barricade the actual 1832 Paris rebellion ""would doubtless have been dismissed as just one more unsuccessful 19th-century insurrection"" had Victor Hugo not chosen it as the setting for the climactic scene of his epic novel.Adapting hit stage musicals for film is always a risky business with far more getting it wrong than right (witness Evita The Phantom of the Opera Rent Nine etc.) so give Mackintosh (the producer here) director Tom Hooper (The Kings Speech) and the cast full credit for commitment to the cause. As filmed musicals go its no Singin in the Rain but then you wouldnt expect an elephant to do a dainty pirouette. The filmmakers know their audience (60 million have seen the stage show Its the Emotions stupid.) The emphasis here is raw demonstrative performances using stars who are also strong actors (Hugh Jackman Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway) and not fussing unduly about musical and cinematic finesse. Its not subtle but it works.Even at a running time of close to two hours and 40 minutes the musical has condensed Hugos five-volume narrative to a series of expressive punctuation points. A prisoner Jean Valjean (Jackman) is freed after the fall of Napoleon and dodging parole takes a new identity as a small-town mayor and factory owner. After encountering the prostitute Fantine (Hathaway) he adopts her daughter Cosette. Chased for years by the relentless policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) Valjean ends up with the now adult Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) in Paris where they become enmeshed in the 1832 rebellion.Hoopers strategy is to suggest the monumental (a handful of overhead shots against massive 19th-century sets) but he also gives attention to the close-up intimacy of the performances. In its approach Les Miserables is essentially the opposite of Glee and not just in title. Theres no lip-synching here. LesMiserabless numbers are all sung live to the camera often in intense close-ups in long single takes. With the exception of Peter Bogdanovichs disastrous 1975 Cole Porter tribute At Long Last Love this approach hasnt been used since the early sound era. You can see the performers struggle for control and despite the artifice around them it feels vital and immediate.This technique straight from the heart and tonsils works most effectively on the musicals famous number I Dreamed a Dream by Fantine the factory worker turned prostitute to support her out-of-wedlock daughter. Emaciated and with her hair shorn Hathaway is shown sobbing and the cracks in her voice are less about conventional singing than delivering a deathbed soliloquy.Her performance though brief dominates the films first half though Jackman does more of the musical heavy-lifting. Hes a stage-musical veteran (The Boy from Oz) with a good vibrato-heavy baritone. Jackmans occasional quavery strain at the upper registers of the song Bring Him Home wont make anyone forget Colm Wilkinson who inaugurated the 1985 English version of the musical but then theres no need to Wilkinson has a cameo as the kindly bishop who turns Valjeans life around. As with Hathaway Jackman appears to have starved himself to emaciation so that in early scenes he is all gaunt cheekbones hollow eyes and open-throated singing.Otherwise its a mixed bag vocally. Seyfried (who sang in Mamma Mia) as Cosette has a pretty but light voice though she too is challenged on the high notes. Eddie Redmayne as her lover Marius has a surprisingly full sweet tenor on his big song Empty Chairs at Empty Tables. Crowes somewhat thin baritone undermines the glowering conviction of his performance. But theres one stage ringer here The full-voiced Samantha Barks British musical-contest winner and Les Miz stage singer plays Eponine the earthy love-struck daughter of the sleazy innkeepers who performs the popular tune On My Own.Sacha Baron Cohen as the venal and larcenous Thenardiers along with a blowsy Helena Bonham Carter serve as comic relief. Although Baron Cohens wheedling vocals and random French accent are distracting their boisterous nastiness is a break from the wall-to-wall despair and sacrifice. The busy camera work also occasionally gets in the way of the Paris-set final act where the narrative sprouts a raft of subplots a love triangle between Cosette Marius and Eponine; Javert still chasing Valjean; and finally the plucky little revolutionary urchin Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone) facing the military cannons to sing of hopes for the future.You dont have to go to the barricades for Hoopers film to appreciate it for what it is - a productive experiment an epic-scaled weepie an exercise in sincere kitsch and perhaps too easily dismissed a rare modern movie about the wretched poor a traditional subject of interest at this time of year. As Hugo wrote in his novels preface ""... so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth books like this cannot be useless."" Well they do and in any form Les Miserables isnt.

((c)Universal/courtesy Everett / E) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday December 20 2012 222 PM Title Les Miserables Film Info PG-13 Sexuality violence. Opens Christmas Day at area theaters. Generally speaking moviemaking is a formulaic endeavor -- even if youre working with the highest-caliber components. So lets give Tom Hooper credit for breaking out of his safety zone in such bold fashion. Just last year Hoopers reserved drama ""The Kings Speech"" earned a Best Picture Oscar. Next Tuesday his extravagant ""Les Miserables"" will become a leading contender for the 2013 Academy Awards. To be clear this is an adaptation of the venerable stage musical not the original Victor Hugo novel. Hooper has chosen to embrace the theatricality of his project -- in which there is almost no spoken dialogue -- with full enthusiasm. After all how many fans of Cameron Mackintoshs long-running landmark are looking for tasteful restraint? As every Times Square tourist knows the story begins in 1815 France where Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) vows to start a new life after years in prison. Perpetually chased by the cruel Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) Valjean recreates himself as a God-fearing factory owner and mayor. He also promises the dying prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway) he will rescue her daughter Cosette from two grifters (Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen going all out as our comic relief). As Valjean Hugh Jackman lends a helping hand to Fantine (Anne Hathaway) a dying prostitute. ((c)Universal/courtesy Everett / E) Years later the now-grown Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) and Valjean move to Paris but their lives are far from settled. Javert is on their trail and Cosette has fallen in love with a revolutionary (Eddie Redmayne). At 157 minutes the film is overlong but how else to pack in so many songs and stories? Fortunately this sprawling epic is well-anchored. There cannot be a better big-screen showman than Jackman. Valjean must be so many different men over the years and the actor does an outstanding job in transforming himself repeatedly. Crowe alas is less successful. He is so outmatched by the musical requirements of his role and imbues Javert with so little passion one wonders why he was hired. As for Hathaway she devours the screen in her brief appearance as if the picture were hers for the taking. Many will be impressed by this forceful approach though others may detect a brash -- and likely successful -- Oscar grab. (If that assessment seems unfair watch the film and ask yourself this Do you genuinely see a weak and pitiful outcast or do you see Anne Hathaway?) The rest of the cast meshes together well from the children (including Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche) to stage vets like Samantha Barks (who plays the lovesick Eponine). As Valjean Hugh Jackman lends a helping hand to Fantine (Anne Hathaway) a dying prostitute. (James Fisher/(c)Universal/courtesy Everett / E) Singing live on camera the major players make the most of their anthemic moments. There are a few missed notes but the songs elicit the emotions required. We gasp we sigh we cry. Subtlety in other words is not a priority. The artificiality of the sets the insistent closeups the broadly choreographed showstoppers are all designed for maximum impact. And because this outsized spectacle is tempered by Jackmans humane complexity it works. Who could blame Javert for following him to the ends of the earth? eweitzmannydailynews.com Click for video Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The best of times here include a perfectly cast Hugh Jackman a veteran song-and-dance man onstage in his greatest screen performance as the persecuted Jean Valjean. Anne Hathaway is even better as the doomed Fantine who will tear your heart out with her film-stopping rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream which is enough to make anyone forget Susan Boyle (if they havent already). Its worth seeing the movie for Hathaway alone. Its the worst of times though when Hooper repeatedly traps his stars in tight close-ups during the musical numbers -- practically shoving the camera down the singers tonsils. This is particularly scary in the case of Russell Crowe whose husky rock-style baritone is far more frightening than his character the relentless Inspector Javert is supposed to be. Hooper did a fine disciplined job directing the Oscar-winning ""The Kings Speech. But for some reason he decided he needed to turn the volume up to 12 -- and leave it there -- for William Nicholsons subtlety-free adaptation of the musical by Claude-Michel Schonberg Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel. This works sometimes astoundingly well for much of the movies first hour as prisoner Valjean (an emaciated Jackman) escapes in 1815 after 14 years of hard labor for stealing a crust of bread. After singing his heart out on a mountaintop for some reason -- hey its a musical -- Valjean with the help of a sympathetic priest begins a new life under the first of several assumed identities. Years later former prison guard Javert shows up and recognizes Valjean whos become mayor of a small town. Just as Javert is about to collar him another man the authorities mistakenly believe is Valjean is arrested. The conscience-stricken Valjean admits his ruse to avoid sending an innocent man to the gallows. Because of his confession Valjean is tragically powerless to save former employee Fantine whos been forced into a life of prostitution and worse. She dies of tuberculosis leaving her little girl Cosette (Isabelle Allen) an orphan. Valjean flees from Javert and after a decade in hiding is forced to emerge again to save the now-grown Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) whos been adopted by a pair of small-time Parisian swindlers the Thenadiers. Theyre played by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter who provide much-needed comic relief in what amounts to a variation on their roles in ""Sweeney Todd. By this point ""Les Miserables has become far less compelling. Its hard to get terribly excited about Cosettes romance with student rebel Marius (Eddie Redmayne an unexpectedly wonderful singer) whos fancied by the Thenadiers coddled daughter Eponine (Samantha Barks who sings rings around Seyfried). The movie climaxes with the anti-monarchist Paris uprising of 1832 -- but theres no political context whatsoever to explain exactly whats at stake. It all comes off as a picturesque 19th-century version of Occupy Wall Street -- except with the authorities using real bullets. By this point (unlike in Victor Hugos novel) the ubiquitous Javerts unending pursuit of Valjean has become almost as monotonous as Crowes singing. When the fighting begins Cooper finally pulls the camera back for some of the big crowd shots and shows off the impressive period detail -- but far too much of the movie is shot in stultifying close-ups. And exactly what is the point of filming the numbers live -- instead of the usual practice of having actors sing to playback -- if youre going to Cuisinart many of the songs in MTV-style editing? The utter lack of modulation -- and the near-complete absence of spoken dialogue just like onstage -- makes for pretty wearying viewing as the movie works its way into its third hour. ""Les Miserables finally rallies for a really wow finish -- I wont spoil it but many around me at the screening including my wife were weeping.

"Les Miserables Review Looks like the front row - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Les Miserables Looks like the front row  1/2Tom Hoopers Les Miz cameras come in tight to capture the tonsils of his actor/singers when theyre not weaving like inebriates. The effect isnt good.December 19 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticI wouldnt be surprised if ""Les Miserables"" became the most popular movie musical since ""Mamma Mia"" On stage both diversions were and are easy to enjoy in their diametrically opposed ways. ""Mamma Mia"" revels in Greece glitter and ABBA; ""Les Miz"" wallows in France sewers good evil and revolutionaries with fabulous hair.Realizing many eager filmgoers will cry big leaky wooden buckets of tears over director Tom Hoopers film version let me state that I have reviewed the stage version of the musical many times from London to New York to various touring companies and I like the show. I do. Its the only 80s blockbuster of its ilk (""Cats"" ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Miss Saigon"" being the others) that I really do like. Its big but not entirely reliant on spectacle. Its compression of the Victor Hugo novel musicalized by Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil with English-language lyrics by Herbert Kretzner is a pretty piece of theatrical craft.You get the right singers for the roles and a couple of tolerable comic-relief types for the sleazy innkeepers who lead the chorus in that infernal tune ""Master of the House"" and youre more than halfway to the barricades.Now the movie.I didnt like it.Why?Theres no genre I cherish more than film musicals. Hugh Jackman (who plays sings mutters and roars his way through the role of saintly Jean Valjean) has the stuff the training the voice and ability to express 101 percent of whats needed in a fervent close-up. Anne Hathaway a fairly sure bet for a supporting actress Oscar as Fantine grabs ahold of her big song ""I Dreamed a Dream"" like someone with an Oscar to win. Russell Crowes voice may be wrong for Inspector Javert -- he spends most of the score straining in his upper register while sounding like an amalgam of all four Beatles -- but already hes taking the rap for single-handedly dragging ""Les Miz"" down which is silly. The movie drags itself down.Hooper directed two films I very much admire ""The Kings Speech"" and ""The Damned United"" and now he has made his largest and worst. He films a great deal of it in eyebrow-to-lower-lip close-up. Or else he cuts like a maniac raised on too many Ken Russell biopics shaping each individual set piece as a blur of noise and chaos. Theres no breathing room in his approach visually or otherwise.The musical is ""sung-through"" as the theater people say crammed with nattering recitative i.e. dialogue that is sung either in earnest or on the fly. The camera bobs and weaves like a drunk frantically. So you have hammering close-ups combined with woozy insecurity each time more than two people are in the frame. Twenty minutes into the retelling of fugitive Valjean his monomaniacal pursuer Javert the torch singers Fantine and Eponine and the rest I wanted somebody to just nail the damn camera to the ground.The years pass; Valjean becomes a respectable and wealthy man with a dangerous secret and an adopted daughter Cosette who grows up to be Amanda Seyfried while Javert keeps almost nabbing the ex-con continually eluding his grasp and vexing him to his very soul with his goodness. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter mightve worked as the innkeepers under a different director and with funnier bits but they come off like third-raters here. Eddie Redmayne (Marius) does well by ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables"" but too little in this frenzied mess of a film registers because Hooper is trying to make everything register at the same nutty pitch. With the camera an inch away from everybodys noses you worry about catching a cold or something.Many will adore it. But how you film a musical number (and this material is essentially a three-hour musical number) matters when youre doing a musical on film to state the obvious. ""Les Miz"" appears destined for many Oscar nominations. Until that nomination announcement day Ill just dream a dream of musicals gone by directed by people who could create a rhythm and establish a style that complemented the story the performers and everything in between.mjphillipstribune.com MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesJust A Minute With Hugh Jackman on Les MiserablesDecember 26 2012Broadway Review Les MiserablesMarch 23 2014Marriotts Les Miserables still emotionally stirringFebruary 23 2008`Les Miserables Looks Lovely But Lacks TurmoilMay 1 1998Les Miz isnt the only film to catch its singers actually...November 29 2012Find More Stories AboutJean ValjeanTom HooperTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1221-les-miz-20121220,0,6890419.column",200,lesmiserables(2012)26,lesmiserables(2012),chicagotribune

I loved it. The live singing was groundbreaking and made this seem lisa live musical in a huge setting. HUGE difference from recording and lip syncing that is done all the time now. I was astonished at Amanda Siegfrieds voice - it is lyrical and brilliant and rings like bells or like a waterfall in the morning sun. I thought Russell Crowe carried his role perfectly even though his singing voice is very plain. In a way he reminded me of Rex Harrison who was a phenomenal musical theater actor even though he ""spoke"" his singing. The one voice I wondered about Hugh Jackman. I know hes been in lots of musical theater. It seemed like he had difficulty reaching the notes. But I loved it. There was so much happening so much heavy emotion that when the movie ended I felt very tired from the emotion. My friends had the same experience. I give my heartiest recommendation to this film. Jovissaid on Saturday April 27 2013 51206 PMOnce again Richard we kindly disagree with you. Les miserables more like we were all miserables. We all dreamed a dream that Russell Crowe would take a cue from Anne Hathaway and cease his whale like pipes and jump off a bridge a lot sooner preferably before he started singing. I didnt need to see him get his butt handed to him by a bunch of 14 year olds. Anne hathaway should of worked more on her dancing and less on her crying. Where were the dancing parts in this musical movie? Just because youre dying of starvation and venereal disease doesnt mean you cant throw in a jaunty jig every now and then. The ending was very confusing. I didnt know they were doing a prequel to what dreams may come minus the american treasure Robin Williams. He has a veneral disease and he still manages to fly. Why was wolverine in a jail cell when everyone knows he has metallic claws? Richard this movie left more questions than answers. Janicesaid on Thursday January 24 2013 94331 AMIve seen it twice and loved it both times of course. Hugh Jackman was amazing. Russell Crowe was better than most reviews give him credit for. Samantha Barks was great. I dont understand all the praise for Anne Hathaway though. I think she was doing some major scenery chewing--""look at me ACTING"". I didnt find her performance real at all. I was glad the character was hardly in the film. Tonysaid on Wednesday January 16 2013 91612 PMEnjoyed the movie but stronglyIidsliked Hooper overuse of close ups. Why expand the scope and show repeated closeups? Philip Hemingsaid on Sunday January 06 2013 115507 AMIve seen Les Mis twice now in London separated by a 2 year period. I cant imagine that the film will enhance my experience. Like so many stage shows often transfer to the big screen proves very disappointing. In a theatre so much is left to your imagination which is usually a better experience than someone elses representation on a film set. Whilst opening up this experience to none theatre go-ers may give them some insight I think that stage musicals should be left as just that stage musicals Jsaid on Saturday January 05 2013 90252 PMGood review and I agree with much of the comments made. However this is NOT the first movie musical to use live singing as opposed to lip-synching. A lot of people think that but its just not true. Reply from Richard Roeper J Can you give us some other examples? Best RichardJohnsaid on Saturday January 05 2013 14033 PMGreat review I took my 8 year old grand daughter to see it She loved it I didnt like it would of left 30 minutes into it on a 0 to 10 grampa 3 grand daughter 10 Vivian Rittersaid on Monday December 31 2012 90355 PMThank you Richard for your thoughtful comments. I am so tired of reviewers who tout their ""superior"" taste but to me they only reveal that they are clearly not fans of popular musicals. Hey if you dont like musicals dont review them. Everyone in my audience applauded at the end of this one. Andrew Y.said on Friday December 28 2012 124127 PM""Les Miserables"" is NOT the first musical film to record singing live. This was common practice as early as the 1930s. In fact ""Love Me Tonight"" (1932) recorded a full orchestra and vocals simultaneously live on set. Hoopers ""Les Mis"" is ambitious sure but it really isnt as innovative as the filmmakers would like you to believe. Jonathan Gsaid on Wednesday December 26 2012 35850 PMSaw this movie on Tuesday when it hit theaters if I was hosting ""At the movies"" with Ebert and Roeper id say I just give it a regular thumbs up. Jackman and Hathaway are sensational and deserve oscar nominations but the movie just went on and on and on and on until finally as the movie is about to end I was just waiting for it to finish. It drags on way to long. I also wasnt to crazy about Russel Crowes performance. I liked this movie..... but frankly I was expecting more and I wasnt expecting it to go on for as long as it did.

Countering the standard practice of having the actors in a film musical lip-synch their songs to prerecorded tracks (a/k/a ""playback"") director Tom Hooper (The Kings Speech) insisted that all of the singing in his Les Mis happen live on the set in the moment with hidden earpieces allowing the actors to hear the orchestrations. The result is a movie musical unlike any youve heard before Real voices emerge in real time complete with assorted tremors gasps for breath and other ""imperfections"" of the sort typically smoothed away in the studio. The quality of the sound recording is exceptional too as crisp as in the best concert films and live albums. Inevitably you wonder what the likes of My Fair Lady West Side Story and The King and I would have sounded like if theyd been made this way and without the reassuring soprano of Marni Nixon emanating from their leading ladies.The live singing is but one part of Hoopers concerted effort to inject grit and verisimilitude into Les Mis--a lofty strategy that has become folly by late in the film when the proletarian hero Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) sloshes through the sewers of Paris with the body of the wounded revolutionary Marius (Eddie Redmayne) slung across his mighty shoulders both men caked in human excrement. For the more Hooper tries--and oh how he tries ratcheting the filth amp to 11 and shooting almost everything with an arsenal of wide-angled handheld cameras--the more the moist-eyed storybook romanticism of the source material proves resistant to his efforts.Its doubtful after all that realism--or any semblance of it--is what audiences were seeking when they turned British uber-producer Cameron Mackintoshs 1985 stage production into one of the biggest of all musical-theater blockbusters. Liberally inspired by Victor Hugos 1862 novel Les Miserables the musical first entered the world as a French-language concept album by composers Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg--and a concept album it very much remains. Hugos panoramic study of the underclasses between the end of the French Revolution and the failed Paris uprisings of 1832 is here boiled down to a series of noble peasant heroes cardboard villains and star-crossed lovers belting out sound-alike anthems about the resilience of the human spirit. Developed by Mackintosh into a full-scale English-language production that premiered on Londons West End in 1985 (where it is still running) Les Mis arrived in New York two years later on the heels of the Mackintosh-produced Cats and just ahead of his Phantom of the Opera--the ""British Invasion"" trifecta that at a low ebb for original American musicals revitalized Broadway as a tourist mecca.Film Details Les Miserables RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time157 More Info On stage Les Mis has about as much to do with Hugo as Rent has to do with Puccini but it has undeniable kitsch appeal with its own literal piece de resistance--an enormous rotating barricade--in lieu of Phantoms plummeting chandelier. On screen there are fewer pleasures though the opening moments are undeniably impressive in an old-fashioned epic-monolithic way as the camera drifts up from underwater to reveal Valjean and a chain gang of prisoners hauling an enormous ship into port under the crash of waves and the glower of the police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe). Later when a paroled Valjean jumps bail and flees through a snow-capped mountain expanse (actually Gourdon in the South of France) the film exudes a wide-open physical grandeur not often seen in musicals--save for the few like Fiddler on the Roof shot on real locations instead of studio sets. There are a handful of other show-stopping moments along the way though Im not sure if the most discussed of them--Anne Hathaways rendition of the tortured ballad ""I Dreamed a Dream""--stops the show for the right reasons. The impassioned lament of Fantine a fired factory worker forced into prostitution to support her illegitimate daughter ""I Dreamed a Dream"" is already emotional pornography of the first order made more so by Hathaways borderline hysterical interpretation all bulging eyes and hyperventilation as if Hooper were shouting ""More More"" into her earpiece. Is this realism or the precursor to spontaneous combustion?Yet its hard to place too much fault on the direction of a movie that feels less like an exercise in filmmaking than in careful brand management. Once upon a time directors entrusted with bringing some popular work of theater or literature to the screen were allowed to be creative to reshape and adapt as they saw fit. And the audiences that lined up for Cabaret and The Godfather and The Exorcist instinctively understood that they wouldnt be seeing a scene-for-scene page-for-page translation of the source.But in todays Hollywood where ""pre-awareness"" reigns supreme and the rights-holders of underlying properties retain ever more say in the adaptation process writers and directors are increasingly reduced to the level of corporate lackeys. Occasionally a filmmaker will still be given major leeway to reinvent a well-known character or franchise (as Christopher Nolan was for his Batman films) but more often--whether its Twilight or The Hunger Games or The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo--the clear mandate is to cater to the base and Les Mis is no exception. Try as Hooper might to make the movie his own the only real changes he has been allowed are cosmetic and stylistic and even smeared in shit Boublil and Schonbergs gleaming icons cannot be dulled.

A confluence of bad decisions and worse performances make this a punishing endurance test -- and Anne Hathway is so singularly awful shes got the Oscar wrapped up In the early 1990s I accepted an invitation from a friend to go see the national touring company of ""Les Miserables"" even though it was being mounted at Dallas Music Hall at Fair Park (before its eventual renovation the venue was acoustically iffy at best) and despite my trepidation over the then-popular ""Miserable Cats of the Opera"" mega-musicals. And while the show is not without its gimmickry and manipulation I found it genuinely moving and exhilarating with the showstopping 11 oclock number ""Bring Him Home"" (which had been played to death in the constant TV ads for the production) giving me chills. I mention this only to fend off complaints that I have no soul or no affinity for the material at hand because it is my duty to inform you that ""Les Miserables"" the movie is a catastrophe of epic proportions. Director Tom Hooper (""The Kings Speech"") piles one terrible decision upon another with the result being a movie so overbearingly maudlin and distorted that its one of 2012s most excruciating film experiences. Mistake number one comes in the way he shoots whats happening -- its one thing to give us singing prisoners and gendarmes and prostitutes and soldiers and revolutionaries with the accommodating distance of the stage but to have these same entities with the camera going right up their nose just accentuates the bizarre counter-intuitiveness of having these characters singing virtually every word of dialogue. (There are in fact three basic camera positions in the film Too Close Rapid-Fire Figure 8 Around the Action and Helicopter View of 19th Century Paris.) By now you know the tale Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread is paroled from his sentence of hard labor even though brutal prison guard Javert (Russell Crowe) is convinced that Valjean will inevitably return to crime. The desperate Valjean steals from a kindly priest and when the priest tells the authorities the silver had been a gift the newly redeemed Valjean attempts to rebuild his life. Under a new identity he becomes a mayor and the owner of a rosary factory but a visit by an unsuspecting Javert distracts Valjean while poor Fantine (Anne Hathaway) is fired under false pretenses. Too late to save the woman who turns to prostitution and hair-selling to support her daughter Valjean vows to raise the child Cosette (Isabelle Allen then Amanda Seyfried) as his own. And then theres the second French revolution and Cosette falls in love with rich student/slumming revolutionary Marius (Eddie Redmayne) and Javert still hovers in the background obsessed with bringing Valjean to what the officer believes is justice. One of the nefarious powers of ""Les Miserables"" the movie is its ability to reduce Victor Hugos novel considered one of the great achievements in world literature to a hacky melodrama that even a young D.W. Griffith might have found overly precious. Oh the performances Jackman and Hathaway are both playing to the back balcony rather than to the camera lens thats just inches away. Jackman over-articulates over-gesticulates and pretty much over-everythings. Worse still are those moments where rather than singing all his dialogue he has to transition from speech to song within the same line. (""Were leaving now PACK YOUR THIIIIIIINGS"") Even his ""Bring Him Home"" paled next to the version performed by that actor who came to Dallas 20 years ago raising nary a hair on the back of my neck. Hathaway meanwhile takes every opportunity to suck all the oxygen out of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" the number that is this shows ""And I Am Telling You Im Not Going."" Earlier in the film Fantine sells some of her back teeth to a shady dentist who promises to leave her ""enough to bite."" Clearly he also left her enough to gnash. Its a ghastly eyelid-fluttering self-serving sympathy-begging performance; Oscar voters are guaranteed to eat it up. And then theres poor Russell Crowe whos had success as a vocalist with his bands 30 Odd Foot of Grunts and the Ordinary Fear of God but singing in a bar band and belting quasi-operatic Broadway songs are two very different things. Hes giving it his all but falling short throughout; you can tell from the strain that hes singing on his tippytoes. The one performer who stands out is Sasha Baron Cohen who cuts through the rest of the films noble masochism with the grungily cynical ""Master of the House."" (Helena Bonham Carter is lazily cast as the innkeepers shrewish wife.) But even Baron Cohen wears a bit thin by the fourth reprise or so. Admittedly I sat in the screening room surrounded by people who were sniffling if not outright bawling so this movies clearly working for someone. And to some extent I empathize Im always left a soppy wreck by Claude Lelouchs 1995 version in which Jean-Paul Belmondo plays both Valjean and a truck driver transporting Jews out of France during World War II. For me though this was the kind of movie where I started rooting for the French soldiers only because every time they shot someone that meant one less singer on screen. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Review Les Miserables short on subtlety but big on sentiment - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Les Miserables short on subtlety but big on sentimentBy Karen DSouzakdsouzamercurynews.comPosted 12/23/2012 053543 PM PSTUpdated 12/24/2012 040822 AM PSTGrab some tissues and head back to the barricades The long-awaited Hollywood version of ""Les Miserables"" storms movie theaters Christmas Day.Based on Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublils blockbuster musical which has been seen by nearly 60 million people worldwide since its 1985 debut this ambitious big-screen adaptation may be short on subtlety but it comes up huge for sheer gobsmacking sentiment. While the film has many flaws from sloppy pacing and imperfect vocals to a miscast Russell Crowe as the vile inspector Javert theres no denying its devastating emotional ferocity. And if you are in the mood for a good cry (or three) rejoice. Your eyes may well be red for days after this relentless tear-jerker. Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper (""The Kings Speech"") stays very true to the muckraking spirit of Victor Hugos 1862 novel its harrowing denunciation of a society that oppresses the many to benefit the few. Indeed one of the most visceral aspects of this gorgeously shot epic is its embrace of grittiness. Panoramic shots of the poor faces encrusted with sores and grime begging for pennies from the rich drive home the desperation of 19th-century France. This unflinching depiction of the brutal nature of squalor gives the film its bite. Advertisement But there is also a price to be paid for all that realism. Sometimes the sprawling melodrama is so dire and grim that its hard to find comfort in the rousing score and comic interludes.The garish antics of the thieving Thenardiers fall flat here. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter generate no zest in scenes that should be outrageously funny. Cohen who was such a hoot as ""Borat"" in particular comes off quite drab. Eponine (the gifted Samantha Barks) also loses some of her sauciness because there is no mischievous glee lurking beneath the tragedy. ""The Lovely Ladies"" number is so horrific its hard to sit through. That lack of comic relief can make the picture seem bombastic instead of sweeping.That said its hard to resist the movies wrenching sense of intimacy.The real revelation is Anne Hathaway. While some have brought better pipes to the part no actress has made the ill-fated Fantine more believable. Here she is not a simpleton or a saint just a real woman degraded by an uncaring world. Her hair savagely shorn the haunting Hathaway seems a natural for an Oscar nod. Cheated out of her youth Fantine slaves away in a factory in backbreaking drudgery. When she loses her job through no fault of her own she is reduced to the gutter. Desperate to support her small child she sells all she has -- her hair her teeth and finally her body as one of the Lovely Ladies. Hathaway radiates her broken spirit but also her steel. Fantine would gladly die to save Cosette (Amanda Seyfried). Her shattering rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" will reduce many to sobs. Its all the more beautiful for the imperfections captured by the live singing technique. For his part Hugh Jackman a Broadway baby at heart carries the rest of the picture as the ultimate underdog Jean Valjean who languishes in prison for 20 years after stealing a single loaf of bread to feed a starving boy. Once he is released from the clutches of the dastardly copper Javert (a one-dimensional turn by Crowe) he finds himself tainted by his conviction hounded like a dog roaming the country in search of salvation. If some of the actors sound strained reaching for the high notes in this classic score such as the shaky Seyfried in Cosettes duets with the college radical Marius (Eddie Redmayne) Jackman sounds like he is having the time of his life. He gilds the forgettable new song ""Suddenly"" with a sense of dawning redemption. Unfortunately ""Les Miz"" cant shine as brightly as it should without a proper villain to torment Valjean and Crowe seems tame as the menacing Javert. Hes a decent actor but he cant emote and sing at the same time -- and that undercuts many of the films pivotal confrontations. Perhaps if the score had not been recorded live this flaw would be less grating.While the antagonism between Valjean and Javert never cuts as deeply as it should Hooper magnificently captures the throb and pulse of revolutionary Paris. He and cinematographer Danny Cohen open up the action of the play in sweeping scenes of pageantry such as peasants hurling furniture out of garret windows to make a barricade. These live-action shots are far more eye-popping than the movies CGI interludes because they humanize the spirit of revolt the thrilling seduction of anthems such as ""One Day More"" and ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" The real love story coursing through ""Les Miz"" after all isnt about any one man or woman -- its about the yearning of the people to be free. Contact Karen DSouza at 408-271-3772.

In Fortins case he helps a Jewish family escape both the Gestapo and the anti-Semitic collaborators all too keen to sell them out and its Lelouchs unflinching depiction of Frances shoddy wartime treatment of the Jews that puts a little iron in the movies abundant soul. You could argue that such hard-edged drama sits ill beside the generally light-hearted tone of Belmondos picaresque adventures and the imaginative dips in and out of Hugo but its part of the magic Lelouch has worked that his story-of-all-stories theme matches the catch-all inclusiveness of his old-fashioned celluloid showmanship. Although Boujenahs portrayal of the hard-pressed Jewish father Ziman sails close to caricature elsewhere Leotard and Girardot make a marvellously grizzled rural couple while Belmondos performance sweeps the whole thing along with undemonstrative charisma.

Singing in images so close-up You can count the peoples pores? Singing loud as if youre deaf Singing it live. This truly is Tom Hoopers YouTube Karaoke Film of Les Miz. The movies first shot begins underwater beneath a tattered French flag. Then it surfaces and ascends high above a ship being dragged into its dock by hundreds of rope-pulling convicts. Finally it swoops into a closeup of one of the prisoners the emaciated Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) exerting himself in the chorus of the condemned ""Look down look down/ Upon your fellow man"" Ordered by the warden Javert (Russell Crowe) to lift a heavy spar that carries another flag Valjean does so demonstrating tremendous strength and in a brief tableau proving he is a human Jesus selflessly bearing a cross for the sins of humanity he has suffered all his life -- and will suffer until his death. This impressive opening scene of the movie Les Miserables kindles the hope that Tom Hooper who won an Oscar for directing The Kings Speech will find reserves of ingenuity to bring one of the worlds most popular stage musicals to potent life onscreen. He certainly has the material for it. Based on Victor Hugos 1400-page novel the musical follows Valjean from his 1815 prison parole after he served 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and for several attempts at escape. His worldview is changed by the intervention of a kindly bishop (Colm Wilkinson) but his luck remains rotten. By 1823 having fled Javerts obsessive pursuit he earns wealth and standing under an assumed name as a factory owner and mayor. Unknown to him one of his employees Fantine (Anne Hathaway) is unfairly fired and forced into prostitution to support her daughter Cosette raised by the predatory innkeepers M. and Mme. Thenardier (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter). Valjean adopts and raises Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) who during the 1832 Paris uprising falls in love with the rebel aristocrat Marius (Eddie Redmayne) as does the Thenardiers plaintive daughter Eponine (Samantha Barks). Passion and politics are dirty work nearly everyone ends up in the sewers. (READ Robert Hughes on that ""sublime windbag"" Victor Hugo) Filmed a couple dozen times the 1862 novel became a sung-through show a pop opera with music by Claude-Michel Schonberg and a libretto by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel that opened in Paris in 1980. It found the form that launched its worldwide success in the 1985 London version that was anglicized by Herbert Kretzmer and directed by Trevor Nunn and John Caird. That production -- boasting an epic scale and revolving turntables that made the student revolt literally revolutionary -- is still playing in London. Sibling editions ran on Broadway (for 16 years) and in 40 other countries in 20 other languages. The plight of Jean Valjean of Fantine and Cosette and Eponine and perhaps even of Javert has led millions to the barricade of tears. Despite what the young Cosette sings crying is definitely allowed. One can debate whether Les Miz is superior musical drama but as millions can attest its a great weep. (READ William A. Henry IIIs 1987 review of the Broadway Les Miserables) The new Les Miz whose script by William Nicholson is faithful in most particulars to the show remains a grand sob story on a noble plane -- a tale of justice outraged as Valjean marches in song up his 40-year calvary and a silent God looks down without intervening in the cruelties man perpetrates on man and woman. The Schonberg anthems retain their kick smartly arranged for the screen and performed by a cast that is nothing if not game. (Jackman lost weight to play the part of the emaciated convict then put on 30 lb. during the production; Hathaway whom no one would call flabby lost 25 lb.) Sensitive souls in search of wrenching emotion can be guaranteed their Kleenex moments; you will get wet. But aside from that opening scene you will not be cinematically edified. This is a bad movie. (READ a review of the 1927 film of Les Miserables by subscribing to TIME) You would have seen this coming if you paid attention to my early review of The Kings Speech which went on to win Oscars for Best Picture Actor Screenplay and for Hooper Direction. There too the central emotion -- of a monarch crippled by his stammering -- was strong yet Hooper felt obliged to hammer home the feelings in case anyone missed them. He amplified to rock-concert level every pained plosive in the royals diction and pushed certain characters dangerously close to caricature (so we knew who were natures nobles and who were the knaves). Hoopers emotional grandstanding forced some viewers who prefer nuance over a poke in the heart to juggle their response tsk-tsking the florid directorial gestures even as they tried surrendering to the poignant story and acute performances. These viewers now face a greater challenge for The Kings Speech was a model of subtlety compared with the excesses of Les Miz. (READ Corlisss full review of The Kings Speech) ""The fox knows many things"" goes the ancient Greek maxim cited in the last century by Isaiah Berlin ""but the hedgehog knows one big thing."" Hooper is a hedgehog. The one big thing he knows about Les Miz is that the songs should be performed live -- recorded on the set not in a studio before the shoot -- as was the custom in Hollywood in the early sound era and was revived not too fruitfully in Peter Bogdanovichs 1975 At Long Last Love. Beyond that Hooper shot whenever possible in closeup and with no cuts. (READ Jesse Dorris on ""a whole new kind of musical"") This tactic works brilliantly -- once in Fantines solo ""I Dreamed a Dream."" Her head shaved her huge eyes welling up in the skull of her emaciated face her clear soprano voice swooping into gritty gravity Hathaway gives a bravura performance that is also the definitive reading of the text idealism and disillusionment life and death all in one shot. At 19 the actress wowed the City Center Encores audience as Lili in a 2002 revival of Carnival. At 30 she rescues ""I Dreamed a Dream"" from Susan Boyle and makes one wish that the Weinstein Company would exhume its notion of putting Hathaway on Broadway as Judy Garland. (READ Corliss on the Encores musical revival series) All right. Well grant that the single-take closeup strategy works twice Barks making her film debut after playing Eponine in the West End locates the waifish pining in a superb ""On My Own."" Like ""I Dreamed a Dream"" this is a chanson des regrets amoureux in the French pop tradition; it could have been sung by Edith Piaf or Juliette Greco and is suitable for intimate visual treatment. (READ Richard Schickel on the Piaf biopic La vie en rose) The problem is that Hooper extends the ploy far beyond its usefulness to virtually every aria. In Valjeans ""Soliloquy"" and ""Who Am I?"" the camera strenuously backpedals as Jackman strides toward it. His voice goes fortissimo with the songs emotion as if he needs to be heard by someone in the third balcony yet hes nose to nose with the viewer. So many of the numbers in Les Miz have the impact of a stranger shouting in your face. That might be forgivable if the screen were of YouTube size but this is for movie theaters. (Worst news of the month an Imax version is planned meaning that the screen the faces and the aural assault will be larger still.) (READ Schickels review of the 1995 Les Miserables film) Of course performers in stage musicals sing live eight times a week. And most of the prominent names in this Les Miz have sung in public Jackman in a West End revival of Oklahoma (also directed by Nunn) and on Broadway as star of The Boy from Oz Crowe with numerous rock bands Seyfried as the soubrette in the Abba Mamma Mia movie. But you know what? Singing Les Miz is hard. And some members of the cast dont sound their best here. (READ Corlisss review of the Mamma Mia movie) Crowe who has poured his intelligent machismo into two decades worth of movie roles is surprisingly timid in his big number ""Stars""; for once you may want the volume turned up. His tentative approach to his character turns what should be a battle of titans -- the saintly suffering Valjean and his unshakable demon Javert -- into a lopsided contest of star and supporting player. (READ Josh Tyrangels profile of Russell Crowe) Jean Valjean is a role of imperious vocal demands which Wilkinson who originated the role in London conquered with a strong voice of wide supple range. Jackman perhaps encouraged to sell the drama of each song and not worry about the technique throws a lot of vibrato into his solos and occasionally translates Valjeans agony as vocal strain. For lovers of the musical the tensest suspense comes in Valjeans Act II ""Bring Him Home"" with its two-octave stretch. Will Jackman get to that last high note without exploding? He does but the effort registers more than the emotional effect. As so often occurs in this movie the song has become about the singer. Viewers should be rooting for the characters not for the actors to do their jobs well. (READ Lily Rothman on the vocal chops of the Les Miz stars) The earlier movie versions of the Hugo story exploited its epic sweep and that should be the central advantage a film of the musical has over its stage incarnation. But when Hooper pulls back for the big view his camera style switches from mesmerized single takes to catch-as-catch-can choppiness. The barricade scenes are filled with rapid indiscriminate vignettes of the protesters; the shots dont build they just pile up. The same randomness is applied to the cynical would-be-rollicking production number ""Master of the House"" at the Thenardiers inn; the shots of the principals and the bit players are a grab bag of gross reactions cut with no heed to the rhythm of the music. Baron Cohen who can be a daring movie comedian is no help here. He turns in a sloppy interpretation singing the first chorus with a French accent (perhaps because it contains the phrase bon viveur) before settling on a sneering English vocal stereotype. (READ Joel Steins tribute to Sacha Baron Cohen) People near me at the Les Miz screening I attended may step forward to testify ""I saw you cry. In fact I heard you cry."" Its true. Im an easy weep. I get misty at beer commercials and puppy videos and when Chris Christie talks about his love for Bruce Springsteen. Ive sobbed the four or five times Ive seen Les Miz on stage. And a few times during this movie I wiped away tears. Thats my problem and I can live with it. Tom Hoopers problem is soiling good projects with bad direction. Even if his Les Miserables wins as many Oscars as The Kings Speech did its a habit he really needs to correct.

He doesnt want you to forget the momentousness of his grand design either. When an actor begins to sing the camera rushes in and fastens on the performers face positioning itself just below the head somewhere between the navel and the Adams apple--and canted from 30 to 45 degrees although the angle changes as the performer moves and the operator scampers to keep up. I imagined the cameraman to be small fleet and extremely high strung like Gollum. The actors must have had to cultivate an inner stillness to keep from recoiling from him/it. A Zen forbearance would also have kept them from grimacing at all their missed notes. The tasteless bombardment that is Les Miserables would under most circumstances send audiences screaming from the theater but the film is going to be a monster hit and award winner and not entirely unjustly. After 30 or so of its 157 minutes you build up a tolerance for those its-alive-alive-alive close-ups and begin to admire the gumption--along with the novelty of being worked over by such a big shameless Broadway musical without having to pay Broadway prices. The authors (there are four credited screenwriters) have pared down Victor Hugos great wallow of a novel to its dumb pious moral (Christian forgiveness always wins though you might not live to break out the Champagne) but the show has been audience-tested for decades and defiantly holds the screen much like its French revolutionaries at the barricades. Hugos hero Jean Valjean is played by Hugh Jackman who is shockingly emaciated in his first scenes as a prisoner--I mistook him for Ron Moodys Fagin. Jackman is of course an old hand at musicals and looks great when allowed to grow his Wolverine sideburns. He can play Valjeans unwavering goodness without being a simp. But hed have come off better if he hadnt been forced to sing at the tippy-top of his register--and higher. On the other hand no transposition would have helped Russell Crowe as the lawman Javert Valjeans unyielding antagonist His voice is tight and comes from the head the sound of a foghorn ending in a wheeze. But he stands and delivers his numbers--I cant believe Im using this adverb--manfully and I salute him. It cant have been easy for an untrained singer to handle Claude-Michel Schonbergs awful recitativo which does not--unlike Schonbergs near namesake Schoenberg--have the excuse of being purposefully atonal. ""And Im Javerta /a Do not forget my name"" would have crumpled a lesser man on the spot. That music has its adherents but I must cast my lot with the late Nora Ephron who resisted Susan Boyles thunderous debut on Britains Got Talent singing the shows most famous song ""I Dreamed a Dream"" ""That song is worse than all of Andrew Lloyd Webber and its worse than Its a Small World After All. [Its] the all-time most horrible song ever in history and the reason is simple It sticks in your brain and never stops playing ... And just when you think its gone you see the title in print and it starts playing again."" Here it comes at you via Anne Hathaway after her character the unwed mother Fantine is persecuted (""You play a virgin in the lighta /a But need no urgin in the night"") shorn of her locks and raped. She does it in a single take in a ghoulishly tight close-up and although her plucked-chicken appearance is frightful I was filled with admiration when she hit the big notes and stole the song back from Boyle. I even joined in the applause. Hathaway will win many awards for this performance if for no other reason than the image of her giant mouth will imprint itself indelibly on millions of brains some belonging to Oscar voters. Another problem with that camera is that it films every actor--heroic villainous beautiful ugly--from the same vantage which Id chalk up to the democratic spirit of Les Miserables if I thought Hooper knew what he was doing. He loves his actors to death. Amid the large cast Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter as the scoundrel comic-relief types buttonhole the camera before it can buttonhole them Samantha Barks makes an agreeably plaintive Eponine and Eddie Redmayne has a surprisingly strong tenor as the lovelorn revolutionary Marius. Little blonde Isabelle Allen has a sweet voice as Fantines little daughter Cosette but theres something not so attractive going on in the top notes of her older incarnation (Amanda Seyfried). Seyfried put over Abbas ""Honey Honey"" in Mamma Mia but mamma mia is this pseudo-operatic soprano part hard on a natural alto. If you dont know Les Miserables and are thinking of taking young kids you should be aware that in addition to the rape a lot of characters expire of consumption or old age and many more get shot full of holes. But the whole cast--the living and the dead--are back on the barricades for the closing anthem. The actors appear visibly relieved to have gotten through it and not to have to do it again eight times a week. Or perhaps its because for the first time all evening theyre not being charged by a rampaging camera. They can be joyously martyrific.

Because I could cover it in fewer than 50 Call me Bessie cos Ive been thoroughly milked. ""Les Miserables"" is a sprawling splashy musical shellacked with appropriate levels of grimy grandeur. Its designed to make us feel every emotion fortissimo - because pianissimo is so 1862. Its probably not the fault of Victor Hugos novel Exploring just one of the storys themes - the need for forgiveness in a world where injustice and lack of compassion are the order of the day - could easily fill more than 1000 pages. So why not make a bulky doorstop of a musical out of the thing as Claude-Michel Schonberg Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel did in France in 1980? (Herbert Kretzmer would later supply the English-language libretto.) The show went on to thrill audiences on 86 continents bringing in 982.3 trillion - or thereabouts - in revenues. Now Hoopers film adaptation looms even larger. Plus it stars Hugh Jackman Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway all looking much larger than life. Jackman is the hero the peasant Jean Valjean who as the movie opens is just being sprung from 19 years of toil and torture in prison. His crime? Stealing a loaf of bread to feed his relatives. But Russell Crowes Javert a man of the law who adheres to the rules 101 per cent declares that Valjean is ""a dangerous man"" and decrees that he must be ""on parole forever."" Jean almost succumbs to that self-fulfilling prophecy before doing a complete turnaround and becoming the mayor of the town of Montreuil-sur-Mer though he continues to live under cover lest Javert smoke him out. Which of course he eventually does. All of this takes place in an era of political upheaval and social injustice Hooper and cinematographer Danny Cohen show us lots of impoverished toothless citizens huddling in the sewers dressed in rags; in overscaled musicals like this one thats what you call hobo chic. Lots of stuff happens in ""Les Miserables"" Theres a failed revolution in which the most idealistic - and the most innocent - are killed. And theres Jackmans Jean Valjean singing valiantly through most of it One of the tragedies of this hunk of whale blubber is that Jackman really can sing - he does the best he can with the nearly unbroken stream of sung dialogue that constitutes this damn thing. Others attempt with varying degrees of success to hit all the high highs and the low lows though emotionally speaking theres not much in between - everything in ""Les Miserables"" is turned up to 11 and if Hooper achieved some degree of mainstream-pitched subtlety in his last feature the pleasingly polished ""The Kings Speech"" hes lost the magic touch here. Amanda Seyfried makes a serviceably waifish Cosette; Eddie Redmayne is clumsy but earnest as her true love Marius. When Samantha Barks as the spurned Eponine makes her ultimate act of self-abnegation she spreads out every color shes got in a peacock display of sacrificial misery. Its too much and yet not enough. And Crowe having taken a wrong turn from a community-theater production of ""H.M.S. Pinafore"" belongs in a special category by himself He looks so uncomfortable trussed into an assortment of stiff brass-buttoned coats that I began to feel sorry for him. But then I came to my senses and stopped. Only Hathaways defeated and demoralized tragic heroine Fantine in the killer show-stopper tearjerker ""I Dreamed a Dream(tm)"" manages to claw her way toward anything resembling true emotion. Her features - the Paul Klee eyes those pillowy cracked lips - are large enough to stand up to the hyperbombast that surrounds her. For some ""Les Miserables"" may be harmless enough fun Theres something to be said for going to the cinema and getting thoroughly cleaned out having every surface emotion flushed right out of you. And still theres something that makes me uncomfortable about the picture. Here in New York this week a man was killed when he was pushed from a subway platform and couldnt climb up from the tracks fast enough There wasnt apparently time to save him from the train bearing down on him but there was time for someone to snap a picture of his terror and desperation. (The New York Post which ostensibly had time to decide whether or not to run the picture predictably took the low road.) In the context of this event - a moment in which no one stepped in to help even if no one was genuinely able to help -- I should appreciate the themes of ""Les Miserables"" even more. Crimes against humanity are often delicate small and brutal; their effects are long-lasting. Victor Hugo probably could have written 10000 pages on that subject but ""Les Miserables"" just turns it into a cinematic enema. Its garishness is no damn fun.

As a faithful rendering of a justly beloved musical ""Les Miserables"" will more than satisfy the shows legions of fans. Even so director Tom Hooper and the producers have taken a number of artistic liberties with this lavish bigscreen interpretation The squalor and upheaval of early 19th-century France are conveyed with a vividness that would have made Victor Hugo proud heightened by the raw hungry intensity of the actors live oncamera vocals. Yet for all its expected highs the adaptation has been managed with more gusto than grace; at the end of the day this impassioned epic too often topples beneath the weight of its own grandiosity. The Universal release will nonetheless be a major worldwide draw through the holidays and beyond spelling a happy commercial ending for a project that has been in development for roughly a quarter-century. Since its 1985 London premiere the Cameron Mackintosh-produced tuner (adapted from Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schoenbergs French production) has become one of the longest-running acts in legit history outpaced on Broadway only by ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Cats."" ""Les Miserables"" has aged far more gracefully than those two 80s-spawned perennials owing largely to the lush emotionalism of Schoenbergs score the timeless sentiments articulated in Herbert Kretzmers lyrics and the socially conscious themes arguably more relevant than ever set forth in Hugos much-filmed masterwork. In an intuitive yet bold scripting decision scribes William Nicholson Boublil Schoenberg and Kretzmer have fully retained the shows sung-through structure with only minimal spoken dialogue to break the flow of wall-to-wall music. Not for nothing is ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" the pieces signature anthem; song is the characters natural idiom and the storys lifeblood and the filmmakers grasp this idea firmly enough to give the music its proper due. Even with some of the lyrics skillfully truncated this mighty score remains the engine that propels the narrative forward. In visual terms Hooper adopts a maximalist approach attacking the material with a vigor and dynamism that suggest his Oscar-winning direction on ""The Kings Speech"" was just a warm-up. At every turn one senses the filmmaker trying to honor the material and also transcend it to deliver the most vibrant atmospheric physically imposing and emotionally shattering reading of the show imaginable. Yet the effect of this mammoth 158-minute production can be as enervating as it is exhilarating. Blending gritty realism and pure artifice shifting from solos of almost prayerful stillness to brassy clunkily cut-together ensemble numbers its an experience whose many dazzling parts seem strangely at odds. The films ambition is immediately apparent in a muscular opening setpiece that hints at the scope of Eve Stewarts production design In 1815 Toulon France a chain gang labors to tow a ship into port. Among the inmates is Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) overpunished for having stolen a loaf of bread nearly 20 years earlier now being released on parole by Javert (Russell Crowe) the prison guard who will persecute him for years to come. With his scraggly beard sunburnt skin and air of wild-eyed desperation Valjean looks every inch a man condemned but through the aid of a kind bishop (Colm Wilkinson who originated the role of Valjean in 1985) vows in his soul-searching number ""What Have I Done?"" to become a man of virtue. In this and other sequences Hooper (again working with ""Speech"" d.p. Danny Cohen) opts to bring the camera close to his downtrodden characters and hold it there. Its a gesture at once compassionate and calculated and its never more effective than when it touches the face of Fantine (Anne Hathaway) a poor unwed mother ejected from Valjeans factory into the gutters. Hathaways turn is brief but galvanic. Her rendition of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" captured in a single take represents the pictures high point an extraordinary distillation of anguish defiance and barely flickering hope in which the lyrics seem to choke forth like barely suppressed howls of grief. Hathaway has been ripe for a full-blown tuner showcase ever since she gamely sang a duet with Jackman at the Oscars in 2009 and she fulfills that promise here with a solo as musically adept as it is powerfully felt. This sequence fully reveals the advantages of Hoopers decision to have the thesps sing directly oncamera with minimal dubbing and tweaking in post. As carefully calibrated with the orchestrations (by Anne Dudley and Stephen Metcalfe) in Simon Hayes excellent sound mix the vocals sound intense ragged and clenched with feeling in a way that at times suggests neorealist opera. A few beats and notes may be missed here and there but always in a way that serves the immediacy of the moment and the truth of the emotions being expressed giving clear voice to the dramas underlying anger and advocacy on behalf of the poor marginalized and misunderstood. Hathaways exit leaves a hole in the picture which undergoes a tricky tonal shift as Valjean rescues Fantines young daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen) from her cruel guardians the Thenardiers. Inhabited with witchy twitchy comic abandon by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter not terribly far removed from the grotesques they played in ""Sweeney Todd"" these innkeepers amusingly send up their venal disreputable and utterly unsanitary lifestyle in ""Master of the House"" a memorably grotesque number that also marks the point barely halfway through when ""Les Miserables"" starts to splutter. As it shifts from one dynamically slanted camera angle to another via Melanie Ann Oliver and Chris Dickens busy editing the picture seems reluctant to slow down and let the viewer simply take in the performances. That hectic cluttered quality becomes more pronounced as the story lurches ahead to the 1832 Paris student uprisings where the erection of a barricade precipitates and complicates any number of subplots. These include Javerts ongoing pursuit of Valjean their frequent run-ins seeming even more coincidental than usual in this movie context; the blossoming romance between Cosette (now played by Amanda Seyfried) and young revolutionary leader Marius (Eddie Redmayne); and the noble suffering of Eponine (Samantha Barks) whose unrequited love for Marius is heartbreakingly exalted in ""On My Own."" As the characters voices and stories converge in the magisterial medley ""One Day More"" the frequent crosscutting provides a reasonable visual equivalent of the nimble revolving sets used onstage. Yet even on this broader canvas the visual space seems to constrict rather than expand and the sense of a sweeping panorama remains elusive. From there the film proceeds through an ungainly pileup of gun-waving mayhem before unleashing a powerful surge of emotion in the suitably grand finale. Devotees of the stage show will nonetheless be largely contented to see it realized on such an enormous scale and inhabited by well-known actors who also happen to possess strong vocal chops. The revelation here is Redmayne who brings a youthful spark to the potentially milquetoast role of Marius and who reveals an exceptionally smooth full-bodied singing voice particularly in his mournful solo ""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables."" Jackmans extensive legit resume made him no-brainer casting for Valjean and he embodies this sinner-turned-saint with the requisite fire and gravitas. Whether hes comforting the dying Fantine or sweetly serenading the sleeping Cosette (in the moving ""Suddenly"" a song written expressly for the screen) Jackman projects a stirring warmth and nobility. Hes less at home with the higher register of Valjeans daunting two-octave range; theres more strain than soul in his shrilly delivered performance of ""Bring Him Home"" usually one of the shows peak moments. Crowe reveals a thinner less forceful singing voice than those of his co-stars robbing the morally blinkered Javert of some dramatic stature although his screen presence compensates. Barks a film newcomer wisely retained from past stagings more than holds her own; Seyfried (who previously flexed her musical muscles in ""Mamma Mia"") croons ever so sweetly as the lovely passive Cosette; Aaron Tveit cuts a dashing figure as the impulsive student revolutionary Enjolras; and young Daniel Huttlestone makes a delightful impression as the street urchin Gavroche bringing an impish streak of energy to the proceedings.

TWITTER Anne Hathaway Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe sing -- and wage a Sisyphean battle against musical diarrhea -- in Tom Hoopers adaptation of the stage sensation. A gallery of stellar performers wages a Sisyphean battle against musical diarrhea and a laboriously repetitive visual approach in the big-screen version of the stage sensation Les Miserables. Victor Hugos monumental 1862 novel about a decades-long manhunt social inequality family disruption injustice and redemption started its musical life onstage in 1980 and has been around ever since a history of success that bodes well for this lavish star-laden film. But director Tom Hooper has turned the theatrical extravaganza into something that is far less about the rigors of existence in early 19th century France than it is about actors emoting mightily and singing their guts out. As the enduring success of this property has shown there are large emotionally susceptible segments of the population ready to swallow this sort of thing but that doesnt mean its good. PHOTOS Les Miserables Anne Hathaway Hugh Jackman Pose for THR The first thing to know about this Les Miserables is that this creation of Claude-Michel Schonberg Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel is with momentary exceptions entirely sung more like an opera than a traditional stage musical. Although not terrible the music soon begins to slur together to the point where youd be willing to pay the ticket price all over again just to hear a nice pithy dialogue exchange between Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe rather than another noble song that sounds a lot like one you just heard a few minutes earlier. There were 49 identifiable musical numbers in the original show and one more has been added here. Greatly compounding the problem is that director Hooper in his first outing since conquering Hollywood two years ago with his breakthrough feature The Kings Speech stages virtually every scene and song in the same manner with the camera swooping in on the singer and thereafter covering him or her and any other participants with hovering tight shots; there hasnt been a major musical so fond of the close-up since Joshua Logan attempted to photograph Richard Harris tonsils in Camelot. Almost any great musical one can think of features sequences shot in different ways depending upon the nature of the music and the dramatic moment; for Hooper all musical numbers warrant the same monotonous approach of shoving the camera right in the performers face; any closer and their breath would fog the lens as in this instance the actors commendably sang live during the shooting rather than being prerecorded. With Hoopers undoubted encouragement the eager thespians give it their all here for better and for worse. The ""live"" vocal performances provide an extra vibrancy and immediacy that is palpable though one cannot say that the technique is necessarily superior in principle as it was also used by Peter Bogdanovich on his famed folly At Long Last Love. PHOTOS Inside the Fight to Bring Les Mis to the Screen One of the chief interests of the film is discovering the singing abilities of the notable actors assembled here other than Jackman whose musical prowess is well-known. Crowe who early in his career starred in The Rocky Horror Show and other musicals onstage in Australia has a fine husky baritone while Eddie Redmayne surprises with a singing voice of lovely clarity. Colm Wilkinson the original Jean Valjean onstage in London and New York turns up here as the benevolent Bishop of Digne. On the female side Anne Hathaway dominates the early going belting out anguish as the doomed Fantine. Playing her grown daughter Cosette Amanda Seyfried delights with clear-as-a-bell high notes while Samantha Barks as a lovelorn Eponine is a vocal powerhouse. The problem then is not at all the singing itself but that the majority of the numbers are pitched at the same sonic-boom level and filmed the same way. The big occasion when Hooper tries something different intercutting among nearly all the major characters at crossroads in the Act 1 climax ""One Day More"" feels like a pale imitation of the electrifying ""Tonight"" ensemble in the film version of West Side Story. Its entirely possible that no book has been adapted more frequently to other media than Hugos epic one of the longest novels ever written. About 60 big- and small-screen versions have been made throughout the world beginning with a representation by the Lumiere brothers in 1897 and Orson Welles did a seven-part radio version in 1937. In 1985 five years after the Paris debut of the French musical the English-language production with a new libretto by Herbert Kretzmer and directed by Trevor Nunn opened in London to less-than-stellar reviews and is still playing. The New York counterpart packed houses from 1987-2003 and at 6680 performances ranks as the third-longest-running musical in Broadway history (it reopened in 2006 and played another two years). PHOTOS Les Miserables World Premiere Hugh Jackman Anne Hathaway Celebrate Musicals Big-Screen Adaptation At the storys core is Jean Valjean (Jackman) a convict who has served 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and trying to escape and upon his release redeems himself under a new identity as a wealthy factory owner and socially liberal mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. But his former prison guard Javert (Crowe) now a police inspector finds him out and over a period of 17 years mercilessly hounds him until their day of reckoning on the barricades in Paris during the uprising of June 1832. Woven through it is no end of melodrama concerning Valjean raising Fantines beautiful daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen as a tyke Seyfried as a young woman); the latters star-crossed romance with Marius (Redmayne) a wealthy lad turned idealistic revolutionary; his handsome comrade-in-arms Enjolras (Aaron Tveit) and the earthy Eponine who woefully accepts that her beloved Marius is besotted by Cosette. Well and truly having rumbled in from the film version of Sweeney Todd Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen gallumph through as small-time swindlers in very broad comic relief. Startlingly emaciated in his initial scenes while still on strenuous prison work detail Jackmans Valjean subsequently cuts a more proper and dashing figure after his transformation into a gentleman. His defense of the abused Fantine and subsequent adoption of her daughter represent the fulcrum of Hugos central theme that a man can change and redeem himself as opposed to Jalverts vehement conviction that once a criminal always a criminal. The passions of all the characters are simple and deep which accounts for much of the works enduring popularity in all cultures. PHOTOS Behind the Scenes of THRs Les Miserables Cover Shoot But it also makes for a film that when all the emotions are echoed out at an unvarying intensity for more than 2 1/2 hours on a giant screen feels heavily if soaringly monotonous. Subtle and nuanced are two words that will never be used to describe this Les Miserables which for all its length fails to adequately establish two critical emotional links that between Valjean and Cosette and the latters mutual infatuation with Marius which has no foundation at all. Reuniting with his Kings Speech cinematographer Danny Cohen and production designer Eve Stewart Hooper has handsome interior sets at his disposal. However with the exception of some French city square and street locations the predominant exteriors have an obvious CGI look. His predilection for wide-angle shots is still evident if more restrained than before but the editing by Melanie Ann Oliver and Chris Dickens frequently seems haphazard; the musical numbers sometimes build to proper visual climaxes in union with the music but as often as not the cutting seems almost arbitrary moving from one close-up to another so that scenes dont stand out but just mush together. The actors are ideally cast but with a couple of exceptions give stage-sized turns for the screen; this bigness might well be widely admired. Jackman finally gets to show onscreen the musical talents that have long thrilled live musical theater audiences Hathaway gamely gets down and dirty and has her hair clipped off onscreen in the bargain and Redmayne impresses as a high-caliber singing leading man but there is little else that is inventive or surprising about the performances. Still there is widespread energy passion and commitment to the cause which for some might be all that is required.
