If you can see only one film this year about guys who barf on camera attach electrodes to their private parts relieve themselves in public places and demolish a putt-putt course -- and very nearly each other -while riding golf carts then it might as well be ""jackass the movie"" an aggressively and egregiously gross spin-off from the notorious MTV series that famously outraged Sen. Joseph Leiberman (among others) and delighted a thrill-crazed cult aud. Quite possibly the most exuberantly distasteful hodgepodge of beery anarchy and death-wishing irresponsibility ever unleashed by a major Hollywood distrib pic likely wont remain in megaplexes long enough to generate organized protests. But its guaranteed to have a long vid shelf life in frat houses and slacker domiciles everywhere. Cobbled together with breathtakingly brazen haphazardness -- the filmmakers dont even bother to provide capital letters or a colon for the title -- pic is little more than a feature-length version of the TV series showcasing semi-celebrity Johnny Knoxville and his party-hearty associates (Bam Margera Chris Pontius Steve-O Dave England Ryan Dunn Jason ""Wee Man"" Acuna Preston Lacy Ehren McGhehey) in various modes of exhibitionism and judging from the amount of alcohol freely consumed possibly variegated levels of inebriation. Its plotless shapeless -- and yet it must be admitted not entirely humorless. Indeed the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions. As Steve Martin has sagely noted comedy is not pretty.Except for intro and epilogue most of ""jackass"" is filmed in muddy messy digital video. The overall grunginess of tech values is altogether appropriate for a pic in which one plucky fellow consumes a snow cone soaked with his own urine -- and then of course throws up -- and another guy blithely defecates in a toilet on display in a home supply store. Bits range in length from a few seconds to several minutes and in dementia from sadomasochism to arrested development. Many gags are nasty tricks on relatively innocent bystanders but to their credit the ""jackass"" boys are crueler to themselves than they are to any outsider. They pole-vault into walls give themselves paper cuts drive rental cars in demolition derbies skateboard down banisters use their heads as bowling balls attempt to roller-disco while tossed about the back of a speeding truck -- and periodically visit hospital emergency rooms. Occasionally the ""jackass"" crew springs ""Candid Camera""-like stunts with hidden camcorders. A few too many of these involve Steve-O prancing about in a silver-lame jockstrap while identifying himself as ""Party Boy"" to unsettling passersby. (Hidden-camera bits shot in Japan indicate that Japanese passersby are less susceptible to unsettlement than their American counterparts.) But theres something undeniably (albeit perversely) hilarious about an extended sequence in which a ""jackass"" stalwart lubricates a small toy car shoves it up his own anus-and is then x-rayed by a doctor whos not in on the gag.Certain analytical critics doubtless will discern a homoerotic subtext in the many many stunts that revolves around the use and abuse of male rectums and genitalia. Those same analysts may also detect a strain of misogyny in a segment titled ""Ass Kicked by Girl."" Sure enough Ryan Dunn steps into the ring with a female Japanese martial artist looks at the camera and grimly predicts ""Im about to get the shit kicked out of me by a girl."" Which of course he does. Much like the TV show ""jackass the movie"" comes with a disclaimer Dont try this at home kids.
