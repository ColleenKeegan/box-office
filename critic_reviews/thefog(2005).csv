Comments The Fog Maggie Grace (Lost) replaces Jamie Lee Curtis in this remake of John Carpenters 1980 horror movie. Returning to her coastal hometown she finds that her beau (Smallville eye candy Tom Welling) has been two-timing her with the local disc jockey (Selma Blair); all three are descended from the communitys founding fathers which makes them targets for vengeful spirits. The production values are above par but as in Carpenters original seeing ghosts is less scary than imagining them. Rupert Wainwright directed. PG-13 100 min.

On the anniversary of the founding of small Oregon island community Antonio Bay a sinister glowing fog bank rolls in from the sea bringing with it a long-sunken ship the Elizabeth Dane and its crew of ghostly lepers returning to wreak revenge on the modern day ancestors of those founding fathers who were responsible for their deaths. So far so vengeful with Cooper Laynes over-cooked screenplay adhering closely to the blueprint laid down by Carpenters film lifting whole scenes and lines of dialogue (Theres something in the fog). Its only when he tries to add backstory humour or a modern twist that it comes hopelessly adrift. Not that hes entirely at fault. While Carpenter channelled the spirit of Val Lewton bringing a spare lean menace to his spookshow Wainwright director of the lousy Stigmata couldnt raise a scare if his career depended on it relying instead on a surfeit of CGI fog cheap laughs and lazy shock moments. Meanwhile the game Grace is required not only to prowl around in her panties but indulge in a PG-rated shower scene with Wellings hunky charter boat captain whos less a hero than a piece of flotsam. Even more depressing is Selma Blairs lighthouse-bound DJ whos rendered all but inconsequential in this version and alas is no substitute for the originals husky-voiced Adrienne Barbeau.

At once slicker and blander than John Carpenters 1980 shocker of the same title this low-voltage remake drifts rather aimlessly through scenes of mayhem sufficiently subdued to ensure a PG-13 rating. ""The Fog"" crept in on little cat feet without benefit of press previews but likely will move very quickly from megaplex screens to homevid haunts. At once slicker and blander than John Carpenters 1980 shocker of the same title this low-voltage remake drifts rather aimlessly through scenes of mayhem sufficiently subdued to ensure a PG-13 rating. Unfortunately interest lags between the grisly deaths and worse none of the characters generates rooting interest. Dutifully riffing on elements introed in the original scenario by Carpenter and producer Debra Hill helmer Rupert Wainwright (""Stigmata"") and scripter Cooper Layne (""The Core"") paint by the numbers while fashioning a melodrama that is equal parts ghost story and slasher pic. Action is set in the small Oregon community of Antonio Island where civic leaders led by mayor Tom Malone (Kenneth Welsh) and historian Kathy Williams (Sara Botsford) plan a celebratory unveiling of a statue honoring the towns legendarily heroic founding fathers. Trouble is the truth is far nastier than the legend The founders actually financed the growth of their community by seizing a schooner carrying wealthy lepers in search of safe haven. The ship was set ablaze the lepers were horribly killed -- and descendants of the founding fathers prospered. As ""The Fog"" begins however restless spirits are ready to return for the settling of scores. Dark clouds periodically roll through Antonio Island and across the waters surrounding the town to cloak the appearance of ghostly avengers. (Wainwright offers only fleeting glimpses of wraith-like decaying corpses until pics climax.) Various townspeople are stabbed incinerated and otherwise manhandled though its never entirely clear just who is being served just desserts and who is an innocent bystander. Pic often appears to be adrift in spookiness for its own sake unmoored by consistency or internal logic. It runs nearly 10 minutes longer than Carpenters version -- which doesnt rank among directors best work -- and every extra second makes itself felt. Its typical of pics adherence to rigid genre conventions that the very first victims are brazen hotties who are shown drinking dancing and wearing revealing attire prior to their deaths. Another unfortunate meets a gruesome end when shes infected with quick-spreading leprosy while washing dishes. Latter scene doubtless will inspire jokes about a pic that hits audience with everything including the kitchen sink. Theres conspicuously little chemistry between nominal leads Tom Welling (as a hunky charter boat captain pressed into service as a ghostbuster) and Maggie Grace (as a prodigal daughter whos drawn back to Antonio Island by confusing visions of the long-ago murders). Selma Blair fares slightly better while evidencing some spark as a lighthouse keeper who operates her own radio station. (Adrienne Barbeau memorably played the same role in 1980 original.) Other supporting players earn their paychecks without embarrassing or distinguishing themselves. Tech values are routine. In addition to Barbeau original pic also starred Hal Holbrook Janet Leigh Jamie Lee Curtis and John Houseman. For the record new edition is dedicated in closing credits to Debra Hill who also produced 1980 pic and died shortly before the remake started production.

"Teenagers wont mind getting lost in this Fog - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Teenagers wont mind getting lost in this Fog By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 15 2005 It came back"" says someone in The Fog"" to which another character responds Sooner or later everything does."" Theyre talking about an antique watch that has washed up on the beaches of Antonio Bay. Theyre also talking about the shambling leprous corpses that are about to invade their Pacific Northwest village. Theyre also talking about horror movies that get remade like clockwork every couple of decades. This new Fog"" floats in on the fumes of the 1980 John Carpenter original but the surprise is that its arguably better.Not that it has to work too hard. Carpenters follow-up to his 1978 smash Halloween"" has its defenders but its really little more than a decent campfire tale about a coastal mist that serves as cover for vengeful 19th-century ghosts. The new version lacks the eccentricities of the first film but under the direction of Rupert Wainwright (no relation to Rufus Loudon or Martha) its more slickly effective. Its also light on bloodletting so gorehounds will probably hate it. Teens looking for a good scare could do a lot worse.The best part of this Fog"" is that Selma Blair has the role of lighthouse radio DJ Stevie Wayne and shes a definite improvement over Adrienne Barbeau in the original. Stevie warns the town as the deadly mist rolls in and since this is the 21st century watches via webcam as the wraiths dispatch one of the characters. Maggie Grace (Lost"") plays Elizabeth -- the Jamie Lee Curtis part -- but the role has been expanded into an actual character and its she who roots out the nasty village secret that motivates the undead. Tom Welling (Smallville"") has the job of standing around looking handsome and occasionally doing something heroic. DeRay Davis is the African-American comic relief. Kenneth Walsh and Sarah Botsford are zombie bait.The best part of the 1980 Fog"" was how much it left to the imagination a tactic the new film forgoes during the climax when we get a good look at the suddenly unimpressive specters. On the other hand advancements in computer graphics mean that haze has rarely looked so menacing. After 25 years of post-Carpenter horror movies this Fog"" lacks the one thing the original had -- originality -- but it qualifies as more than a mist opportunity.
