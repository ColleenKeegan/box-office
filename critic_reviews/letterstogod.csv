Though it is first in education spending New Jersey has an abysmal dropout rate and equally dire testing scores; director Bob Bowdon cites what a former school superintendent calls ""rampant pervasive institutionalized"" budgetary corruption and a deeply entrenched self-interested teachers union as the culprits. Bowdon a former local television reporter and anchorman pulls together a familiar repertoire of talking heads man-on-the-street interviews remedial graphics and stilted B-roll and ultimately this information-packed indictment plays like a feature-length ""in-depth"" news segment. Moving loosely from angle to angle -- the tenure system the plot against voucher programs the stonewalling of charter schools -- The Cartel makes up for what it lacks in style and structure with selective but stone-cold facts. Although a school-district president rolling up to a budgetary hearing in a white limo and an administration parking lot clogged with luxury cars are undeniably good gets Bowdons strength as a documentarian is more evident in the patience and logic with which he makes an argument for a state and a system in desperate need of reform. (Michelle Orange) (Sunset 5) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - DANCING ACROSS BORDERS When 16-year-old Sokvannara Sar a charismatic Cambodian with a gift for his native folk dances arrived in New York City in 2001 as the protege of the unbelievably rich Manhattan socialite (and generous dance patron) Anne Bass he had never seen ballet -- and wasnt that stoked about it. ""This ballet thing is going to turn me into a duck"" he remembers thinking. ""I dont think I want to do this."" Its a sentiment Sar repeats throughout Dancing Across Borders and it is to first-time director Bass credit that she marked his ambivalence in this otherwise blithely tone-deaf ode to her own generosity and that of dance instructor Olga Kostritzky. Several uncomfortable factors are at play in the story of Sars success -- the clear class and culture shock; the pressure to compress 10 years of ballet training into three lest he lose his patrons attention -- but Bass enamored of his talent and determined to shape it to her liking (""I hope hes going to be what I want him to be"" Kostritzky says) elides every one. Instead we get white folks ruminating lyrically on the peasant Asians role as a kind of grand jete bridge between East and West and long performance sequences that are dazzling to behold but quite troubling to contemplate. (Michelle Orange) (Nuart)DEATH AT A FUNERAL It doesnt take much to improve the first Death at a Funeral the flat Frank Oz-directed Britcom of 2007; a few tossed-off references to Jet and sickle cell anemia will do it. Though the plot of Dean Craigs original script remains almost entirely intact (he receives the sole writers credit) the tweaks by star-producer Chris Rock -- who replaces the pallid ninnies of London with a mostly African-American extended clan gathered in Pasadena to say goodbye to a deceased patriarch -- yield some particularly sharp specifics. Rock plays elder son Aaron whose successful-writer younger brother Ryan (Martin Lawrence) has made his riches off books titled Mamas Secret Black Hurt and Rhondas Tiny Box. Eulogizing Dad before learning about his life on the ""waaaaay down-low"" (Peter Dinklage reprises his role as the extorting secret boyfriend) Aaron refers to his fathers ""love of Golden Girls especially when it went into syndication."" But Rocks interventions cant compensate for excessive fealty to dumb gags involving watery poop and designer hallucinogens. Some cast members bring welcome controlled mania Tracy Morgan as a hypochondriacal friend of the family further hones his logorrheic outbursts. Others like Luke Wilson as a scorned suitor of Zoe Saldana are such null presences that they should have been in the original. (Melissa Anderson)GO  EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP Exit Through the Gift Shop is not just the definitive portrait of street-art counterculture but also a hilarious expose on the gullibility of the masses who embrace manufactured creative personas. Though its credited as a Banksy picture -- as in the ever-elusive U.K. graffiti ninja -- the film began with him as its on-camera subject. Banksys talking head appears faceless under a dark hood to help explain how the role reversal occurred. The real ""director"" of most of the footage herein is Thierry Guetta an eccentric French expat in L.A. who began videotaping his cousin -- the mosaic artist Space Invader -- on his night bombing missions. From there Guetta earned the trust of DIY art notables Banksy Swoon and Shepard Fairey whom Guetta meets on camera at a Kinkos as Faireys printing out enlarged copies of his notorious ""Andre the Giant Has a Posse"" designs. The irony of creating art with tools from a commercial franchise is not lost on Fairey who admits that his logos ""gain real power from perceived power."" Without ruining the late-breaking surprises the impact of Faireys quote sharply resonates after Guetta rechristens himself as the artist ""Mr. Brainwash"" exploiting his connections for his first solo exhibition an inexplicably successful event aided by an L.A. Weekly cover story that inspired frothing among gallery patrons. Too clever to dismiss as another recycled joke on the inanity of modern art Exit is strangely inspirational. Go on pick up an aerosol can paint yourself an empire and see if we call your bluff. (Aaron Hillis) (ArcLight Landmark) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm GO  HANDSOME HARRY A fixture of New York Citys No Wave scene of the late 70s and early 80s -- an era of prolific DIY filmmaking when everybody seemed to be collaborating with everyone else -- Bette Gordon continues her exploration of desire with Handsome Harry. A road movie ensemble piece interrupted by Fireworks-like flashbacks HH finds its hero (played by Jamey Sheridan) reconciling with the unpalatable notion that to paraphrase Oscar Wilde each man maims the thing he loves. Harry a well-liked long-divorced middle-ager capable of only the most awkward interactions with the diner waitress who clearly wants him and the 20-ish son whos driven hundreds of miles to visit him in upstate New York takes off suddenly for Philadelphia to visit Tom (Steve Buscemi) a dying Navy buddy. ""We became men together"" Tom reminisces in his hospital bed -- rites of passage that torment Harry who continues to seek friends from the service to assuage his guilt over a heinous act of betrayal and cruelty. Each visit serves as a set piece for the particular pathologies of white midlife manhood entitlement repression rage self-pity. Gordon films every encounter -- some of which droop under too much hectoring (the script is by first-timer Nicholas T. Proferes) -- with a hesitant empathy maintaining just the right tone before Harrys lushly romantic final reunion. In Gordons films eros capacity to disturb and disrupt is celebrated as its greatest quality. (Melissa Anderson)THE JONESES For a while at least a pitch-black (and therefore pitch-perfect) tale of our times Four business partners masquerading as a happy family move into seven-figure suburbia and sell their friends and neighbors -- which is to say contacts and customers -- on their early-adopter newer-than-brand-new layaway lifestyle. David Duchovny Demi Moore Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth are the client-sponsored grifters; they bait their prey with the latest and greatest gadgets and flash-frozen sushi rolls fresh off the assembly line. But sadly the audience is conned most of all. What plays hard and dark for the films first half goes squishy and blindingly bright as calamity and then outright tragedy lead to the saw-it-coming resolution writer-director Derrick Borte thinks is more sincere than it actually plays. Duchovny is alternately (and suitably) confident and befuddled as the ex-car salesman newly hired to play ""Dad""; Moore as the crews boss out to make numbers and not friends is as icy as the Pomtinis shes pushing on commission; and the ""kids"" one closeted gay and one slutty arent dopes. But for whatever reason the movie goes soft Business turns to pleasure turns to hurt and the moral of the story becomes the story shrug. Still theres Gary Cole as the next-door neighbor who buys the sales pitch he cant afford. Thats recommendation enough. (Robert Wilonsky) (Citywide)LETTERS TO GOD The latest offering in Evangelical-oriented entertainment Letters To God tells the story of an 8-year-old boy who copes with cancer by sending heartfelt epistolary prayers through the mail which in turn inspire his entire suburban community. ""Write a letter to God"" an ailing Tyler (Tanner Maguire) advises his older brother. ""Its like texting your best friend."" Like most fundamentalist fare the film works unapologetically in the style of sloganeering after-school specials. In dramatic terms the problem with devotionals is that the end point is always fore-ordained; theyre all about answers (the answer in fact) not questions. But this weakness is also the genres promise. One doesnt turn to these movies for escapism or suspense but for comfort and affirmation. Letters To God performs this service adequately even pleasantly -- save for the morbid teasing out of Tylers demise. Yet spirituals also have an Evangelical imperative which pushes them beyond benign antidrama to hard-sell propaganda. Tyler doesnt just die a good boy a believer and a saint He dies a crusading missionary his cancer exploited to convert everyone from the mailman to his 8-year-old classmates. With little in the way of story or spectacle to offer nonbelievers the film itself just preaches to the choir. (Eric Hynes) (Citywide)THE PERFECT GAME Obstructing the potential of a legacy he had begun in the 80s by collaborating on Michael Nesmiths eccentric sketch-comedy movies (Elephant Parts Doctor Ducks Super Secret All-Purpose Sauce) director William Dear now appears to be your go-to guy for forgettable family-friendly baseball flicks. Following his Angels in the Outfield and The Sandlot Heading Home is this Downy-soft by-the-numbers biopic with Christian undertones -- adapted by W. William Winokur from his book -- about nine poor kids from Monterrey Mexico who became the first non-U.S. team to win the Little League World Series back in 1957. In an uncomplicated role Clifton Collins Jr. barely has to flex his typical sad-eyed humanism as Cesar Faz a former St. Louis Cardinals janitor who never got his big coaching break because he was Mexican. Laid off for the same reason and now embittered Cesar winds up back down South where hes convinced by a doting young ragamuffin -- and encouraged by Cheech Marins humble priest -- to guide an underdog team on the road to victory. Barely dramatizing off-the-field struggles like visa problems and the boys first taste of good ol American racism the film does a disservice to the community it depicts by rendering an inspiring cultural story entirely uninspired. (Aaron Hillis) WHO DO YOU LOVE The life and times of Chess Records founder Leonard Chess and the outsize personalities of his signees -- Muddy Waters Willie Dixon Howlin Wolf Bo Diddley Chuck Berry -- would make a terrific movie. In fact it did and it was called Cadillac Records. Well who wants leftovers? There was obvious wrangling over rights between the dueling Chess biopics Cadillac got Chuck and Who Do You Love got Bo. Etta James is herein rechristened ""Ivy Mills"" (Megalyn Echikunwoke) and cruelly dispatched with a plot-handy heroin overdose. Chess played by Jon Abrahams is now a far more central figure -- or does everyone else just seem more marginal? -- while Loves restoration of redundant brother/partner Phil Chess shows exactly why he was written out of Cadillac. Abrahams plays Chess self-assurance as off-putting clamminess and a running gag that requires him to greet everyone as ""Motherfucker"" -- supposedly this endlessly bemuses black musicians and lets them know hes not like other white guys -- goes from awful to insufferable. Also free with its facts Cadillac understood the complex tangle of personal racial and familial loyalties that were behind putting electric blues on wax. Who Do You Love solves segregation with a harmonica duet suggesting its proclivity for hot air.

In Letters to God nine-year-old Tyler (Tanner Maguire) suffers from brain cancer (hes had 30 radiation treatments) but hes as upbeat as Shirley Temple. He fuels his spirit by writing letters to God which inspires an alcoholic mailman (Jeffrey Johnson) to rediscover his faith.

A cancer-stricken boy reaches out and touches the life of a hard-drinking mailman -- and for good measure the lives of everyone else around him -- in the clunkily earnest Christian-themed tearjerker ""Letters to God."" Bearing echoes of ""Pay It Forward"" ""My Sisters Keeper"" and even ""Miracle on 34th Street"" this faith-based/fact-based inspirational weepie allows no one to escape the saintlike glow of its terminally ill protagonist. While only the converted will likely see the redemption behind the manipulation pic delivers a strong enough dose of spiritual saccharine to yield solid if not heavenly returns from its trusty target audience. In sending ""Letters"" out to 900 theaters nationwide Vivendi Entertainment clearly hopes to repeat the success of ""Fireproof"" the Kirk Cameron-starring marriage-in-crisis drama that grossed a surprising 33 million in 2008 reminding the industry that a significant number of moviegoers also happen to be churchgoers. The more family-friendly ""Letters"" was helmed by ""Fireproof"" producer David Nixon though its true auteur may be co-director Patrick Doughtie who based the script (credited to himself and three other writers) on his sons battle with a rare brain tumor called medulloblastoma. The same illness afflicts the movies Tyler Doherty (Tanner Maguire) a sweet-tempered 8-year-old adoringly fussed over by his widowed mom Maddy (Robyn Lively) and mildly resented by his teenage brother Ben (Michael Christopher Bolten). Confined to his bed at home when hes not getting chemo treatments or hanging out with irrepressible best friend Sam (Bailee Madison ""Brothers"") Tyler spends his free time addressing letters to God. These epistolary prayers fall into the possession of the Dohertys mailman Brady (Jeffrey S.S. Johnson) a troubled soul whose Irish name is perhaps meant to function as convenient shorthand for ""alcoholic."" Unsure what to do with the letters Brady casually checks out the local church while building the sort of close friendship with the Dohertys (and others along his mail route) that occasionally gives the picture the feel of a homespun 50s suburban drama with evangelical overtones. Awkwardly scripted and staged pic veers from infernally perky feel-good moments and pre-packaged life lessons to lump-in-throat melodramatics while forcing its talented cast to contend with huge swaths of exposition (though Brady gets some helpful flashbacks to a shameful DUI arrest). At various points Brady Ben and even Maddy serve as stand-ins for the skeptical viewer and ""Letters to God"" is at its most effective when it deals directly with the challenge of not just finding faith but keeping it. Scenes of wise mentor figures praying aloud for others may prove discomfiting for some auds but productively so; for the open-minded they should register as honest unabashed expressions of Christian devotion in practice. Considerably less honest is the films treatment of Tyler a pint-sized prayer warrior scrubbed clean of character flaws personality shadings or anything else that might make him an especially interesting or believable person; hes merely there to edify and inspire others to greater depths of faith. The filmmakers desire to pay tribute to Tylers real-life counterpart is understandable and wrenching but its more wrenching than the film itself which reduces its hero to a beaming totem of noble suffering. Result might prove more distancing than bracing to nonbelievers The God of ""Letters"" is one who punishes the young so as to teach the old a lesson. Thats not just clumsy dramaturgy; its bad theology. Pic boasts fairly slick production values in line with its 3 million budget (about six times as much as ""Fireproof""). Colin OMalleys twinkly score has all the insistence of a preacher bent on getting a reaction.
