Its enormous success has prompted multiple sequels which have made a ton of money around the world (with Fox cannily hiring well-known actors and comedians to provide the voices for their individual countries). This money machine with its sure-fire kid appeal makes the fourth entry in the series Ice Age Continental Drift virtually critic-proof. But it doesnt stop me from saying that everything I liked about the original movie has been worn down. Even Scrat and his continuing quest for the perfect acorn seems overly familiar (in part because some of his material was already used in a short subject last year that was packaged with Rio). The artists and writers at Blue Sky studio recognize this problem. Thats why the new Ice Age focuses largely on new characters like Peaches Manny the woolly mammoths teenage daughter (voiced by Keke Palmer) and her desire to fit in with the cool kids (voiced by hip hop artists Drake and Nicki Minaj). Other newcomers include a nasty orangutan pirate (Peter Dinklage) his slinky saber-tooth tiger second mate (Jennifer Lopez) and Sid the Sloths feisty granny (Wanda Sykes). Their misadventures take place against the backdrop of the Earths prehistoric growing pains causing seismic shifts and eruptions that separate our heroes from their families. The result is a script thats jam-packed with jokes relatable story ingredients and large-scale action which is well-staged in 3-D. I dont think kids will have a chance to get bored. Never mind that the freshness of the original Ice Age and its main characters Manny (Ray Romano) Diego (Denis Leary) and Sid (John Leguizamo) has dissipated. How many series could sustain themselves at all through a fourth iteration? But the fact that there is a fourth Ice Age instead of something novel and different from a creative team like the one at Blue Sky is another sign of the times for Hollywood. As long as families around the world pay to see sequels like this Im sure there is no end in sight.

In an era of remakes stereoscopic 3D and countless book adaptations the well for anything innovative has surely run dry.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jul 13 2012 Culture Continental Drift left me numb. My children though had stronger feelings. Ive recently learned a few things about ice ages. First owing to the endurance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets we are still technically in the midst of an ice age that began toward the end of the Pliocene epoch a hair over two-and-a-half million years ago. But ice ages have colder periods (called ""glacials"") and warmer ones (""interglacials""). What we typically refer to as ""the ice age"" is the most recent glacial period which ended some 10000 years ago.I bring this up because cinematically speaking the interglacial period we have enjoyed for most of the last three years ends today and a new glacial is upon us in the form of Ice Age Continental Drift. And while scientists are not predicting mass species extinctions it never hurts to prepare for the worst.What can be profitably said of Ice Age Continental Drift? That it is the franchises fourth installment? That I would have been perfectly content if the interglacial period following the third had lasted 10000 years?Tom 8 said the film was ""the best ever."" I should note though my kids tend to believe that any recently concluded activity was ""the best ever.""Ice Age Continental Drift is an Ice Age movie and those who have seen any of its predecessors will have a reasonably good idea of what to expect. Manny Sid Diego and the rest of their burgeoning ""herd"" take a journey encounter predators and natural disasters engage in wacky antics and learn valuable lessons about friendship and family. Im sorry to report that Simon Pegg who was a pleasant vocal surprise as the one-eyed weasel Buck in the last movie has only a miniscule cameo in this one and the many new celebrity talents assembled for this outing--Jennifer Lopez Peter Dinklage Wanda Sykes and others--do not make up for his absence. The animation has continued to advance as it is wont to do and a few early scenes of avalanche tidal wave and tornado are pretty spectacular. But put the metaphorical gun to my head and Id say Ice Age Continental Drift is worse than the first and third franchise iterations and probably on a par with the second. And thats really all Ive got to say on the topic. In an animation era in which making kids movies that also appeal to adults is all the rage the Ice Age franchise is pretty resolute about making kids movies for kids. And as it happens I had two companions at the screening--Tom 8 and Alex (as in Alexandra) 6--who had considerably stronger opinions regarding the film than I did. Yes this is the part where I outsource my critical role to my children. If you are the kind of person who (quite understandably) abhors this particular gimmick you may wish to stop reading now. So how does this movie compare to the previous Ice Age movies? Tom The best ever.Alex The best. Funny and very adventurous.[I should note here that the views expressed by my children are solely their own and do not express my views or those of The Atlantic. Also though my kids are discerning in many respects--for example when it comes to what they will contemplate eating for any given meal--they have a powerful tendency to believe that any recently concluded activity was ""the best ever.""]Who was your favorite character?Alex Granny [Sid the sloths dyspeptic grandmother voiced by Sykes] because shes so funny.Tom I really liked Captain Gutt [the villainous simian pirate voiced by Dinklage]. He was good at fighting but maybe a little crazy.What didnt you like about the movie? MORE ON MOVIES Does It Matter If the Heroine of Brave Is Gay? Whos Left to Defend Tom Cruise? The Amazing Spider-Man A Swing and a Hit Male Strippers Reveal the Naked Truth About the Recession Our Picks for Which Film to Catch Each Week of Summer Alex The head of the pirates shouldnt have been a monkey. He should have been a bear. Tom There should have been more with Sids family.Favorite moments?Tom I liked it when Scrat was bouncing up and down on the core of the Earth.Alex Thats how they made the continents from his running and bouncing. They were just pretending of course. Thats not how it really happened.Is it just me or were there echoes of Un Chien Andalou scattered throughout the film?Tom [Stares.]Alex [Rolls eyes.]How did the movie compare to Madagascar 3?Alex I think theyre tied.Tom Maybe this was a little bit better.What do you think would happen if the Madagascar characters showed up in an Ice Age movie?Tom I liked Vitaly in Madagascar 3. Hes grumpy because hes a circus tiger who loses his fame and his act when he jumps through a flaming hoop wearing olive oil and catches on fire. If Vitaly were to go into Ice Age well hes really good at throwing weapons. So hed probably be like Im about to throw a battle-axe at your face Sid. And Sid would be like Yeah thats a good one not thinking he was really going to throw it. And then Vitaly would throw the axe about an eighth of a millimeter in front of Sids face and it would be funny.But what if it actually hit him?Tom What if Obi-Wan really died in Star Wars? Of course the battle-axe misses. Theres supposed to be a happy ending.What about you Alex?Alex I would like it if Alex the lion and the jaguar from Madagascar could go into Ice Age. And while they were on the ship there would be trapezes all across the ocean so they could trapeze back to dry land and the ship would follow them.But what would hold up the trapezes?Alex Theres a rope across the ocean from the ship to the land and the trapezes are hanging from that rope.What do you think the story for the next Ice Age movie should be? Tom Theyre stranded on an island. Theres a giant whale sleeping nearby and it snores louder than usual causing a tidal wave that knocks out most of the island. Then they learn that an asteroid is headed for Earth and is going to land next to the island knocking out the rest of it. So they ask a seabird--a pelican--if he knows anyone who might be able to help and he tells them about a stargazer named Billy whos a molehog. [Dont ask.] So they go looking for the star-gazing molehog Billy and when they find him he has a plan. He can predict exactly where the asteroid will hit and its near the sleeping whale. So they need to wake up the whale so it will swallow the asteroid. Manny can hold his breath for a long time so he swims down and wakes up the whale by poking it with a tusk and it leaps out of the water just as the asteroid arrives and swallows it.Alex?Alex The characters find another tunnel to go back underground to where there are still dinosaurs. Buck joins them and then they go through another tunnel that takes them forward in time past the ice age to modern times. And they start exploring the country going to amusement parks and county fairs. Then they go to New York and see the Statue of Liberty. But when they want to go back they cant remember the way and its kind of hard because New Yorks a big city. But they find this train station where if you go there it transports you back to the dinosaur times.That sounds kind of like Prince Caspian. There might be copyright issues.Alex This time you have to get on the train and close the doors and then it will take you back to dinosaur times in like ten seconds. And then they can just go back through the tunnel to the ice age times.I adore my children but in the unlikely event that Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Fox opt for either of these plotlines in any ensuing sequels Id like to offer my apologies in advance. In any case do your best to enjoy the intervening interglacial.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.)

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

What keeps this improbably extinction-resistant series alive must be the Sisyphean tenacity of its mascot the acorn-chasing prehistoric squirrel Scrat. As is revealed in a Looney Tunes-worthy prologue (formerly the freestanding short Scrats Continental Crack-Up) its thanks to this one dotty varmint that the supercontinent Pangaea first went to pieces. Thereafter filler a family divided by tectonic upheaval with mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) smilodon Diego (Denis Leary) and sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) plus Sids feisty grandma (Wanda Sykes) adrift and imperiled on an iceberg while on land Mannys wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) monitors their teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) newly more into fellow-mammoth cool kids (Drake Nicki Minaj Heather Morris) than her doting mole hog pal (Josh Gad). And because thats not yet plotty enough Diego too gets a love interest a big kitty with the voice of Jennifer Lopez. Directors Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier do up the stuff of oceanic epic--pirates sirens perfect storms--and seem attuned to their performers not least an aptly knavish Peter Dinklage as the pirates primate captain. But the best bits are basic and all but voiceless those Scrat-intensive set pieces still inspiredly squirrelly if much too far apart. Poignant then to see Continental Drift preceded by a Simpsons short thats also dialogue free--and more dolefully funny and narratively controlled than that series has been in years.

They offer a distinct visual style a brisk narrative pace and a handful of chuckles for the parents. In short these films are generally good at being good enough and the fourth installment ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" doesnt deviate from that modest tradition. Still a tight-knit group woolly mammoth Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) saber-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and bumbling sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) are thrown into adventure once again when the separation of Pangaea splits Manny from his wife and daughter (""Joyful Noise"" co-stars Queen Latifah and Keke Palmer) and pits all three against an equally unlikely assembly of sea scoundrels led by ""primate pirate pioneer"" Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage). Fairly routine subplots follow Manny has to get back to his family his rebellious teen daughter gives into peer pressure and dismisses a loyal friend (Josh Gad) Diego falls for an equally stubborn saber-toothed tigress (Jennifer Lopez) and Sid has to contend with a grandmother (Wanda Sykes) who annoys him as badly as he annoys everyone else. Feel free to extrapolate every third-act moral from there. Is it the fault of the Blue Sky team that they failed to capitalize on ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" fever before Aardman beat them to it? That the glacier-fleeing panic and themes of inter-species teamwork happen to evoke last Novembers ""Happy Feet Two"" or that the romantic rivalry between fierce felines echoes that of last Octobers ""Puss in Boots""? No in fairness they couldnt have known but when Sid befriends a bevy of fluffy little friends it brings back Part 2s own army of sloths and when he off-handedly apologizes for the last films prehistoric indulgence -- ""We fought dinosaurs in the ice age. It didnt make sense but it sure was fun"" -- it also feels like a passive admission that the series is treading water until its heroes have to go extinct. Until then we get ice pirate songs a quasi-freaky encounter with sirens some remarkably dynamic tectonic action Nick Frost following in Simon Peggs footsteps as an elephant seal Aziz Ansari rather perfectly cast as a restless rabbit hip-hop artists Drake and Nicki Minaj needlessly rounding out the ranks before singing an end-credits song with the cast that then renders one-time bad boy Denis Leary the odd man outand now-dusty ""Braveheart"" references. The films single worst half-joke -- ""Silly rabbit piracy doesnt pay"" -- stands as a mutant aberration of the screenplays ""laugh if you recognize this"" formula a stale pop culture reference fused with weak wordplay just because. But given a moment the beat passes in a flurry of climactic gags and as always at least theres Scrat. The ""Looney Tunes""-flavored antics of everybodys favorite saber-toothed squirrel are as enjoyable as ever initially kicking off the plot (you may have already seen the opening as a short in which Scrats efforts to bury his beloved acorn tear the entire world quite literally asunder) and often serving as something of a reprieve in a sea of sitcom dilemmas and familiar lessons. For that poor rodent its always the end of the world but so long as hes around the ""Ice Age"" films will never rival such depths of despair.

"Thaw at your own peril Ice Age Continental Drift |       NJ.com comments Thaw at your own peril Ice Age Continental Drift Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 13 2012 at 645 AM View/Post Comments Blue Sky StudiosScrat (Chris Wedge) and his acorn in ""Ice Age Continental Drift."" The latest ""Ice Age"" sequel opens today. Can anyone out there honestly say theyve been looking forward to it? The original movie was a mild entertainment a decade ago but since then the franchise has fallen into the category of dull but safe time-wasters -- a fallback strategy for divorced dads and fed-up au pairs. In fact the movies have all become a bit of a blur; I was surprised to realize this is the fourth film in the series. Somewhere along the way I forgot about one of them entirely. I fear ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" will soon join it. Even at its best the series never had a strong approach or point of view. The main story always had a woolly mammoth a saber-toothed tiger and a sloth pushing some friends-and-family-are-important message which is intercut with the silent slightly sadistic trials of an acorn-hungry saber-toothed squirrel. Add to that an extremely loose approach to history -- no ones expecting a National Geographic special here but one episode even brought in dinosaurs -- and you get the whole sloppy picture. ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" continues in the same cavalier vein with far too many characters and an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink plot that drags in the birth of the continents ancient Greek mythology and some Beethoven symphonies on the soundtrack. Also pirates. They are at least animal pirates. And provide the highlight of the entire movie -- a ferocious monkey buccaneer voiced with obvious great relish by Peter Dinklage. (He even gets his own rousing old-fashioned Disneyesque sort of song). But theres too much going on here -- father/daughter conflicts grandson/grandmother bonding a be-true-to-your-friends lesson and a teen love story. Plus some sirens out of Homer and a crowd of chipmunk-like creatures who seem to have memorized ""Braveheart."" And what all that excess signals isnt a surplus of invention but a lack of a single clear idea. The central voice actors -- Denis Leary Ray Romano Queen Latifah and John Leguizamo -- go through their paces with Leguizamo as usual working the hardest as the sputtering sloth Sid. The animators handle texture particularly well the 3-D is used nicely and Dinklage is a welcome addition. But in the end this latest ""Ice Age"" movie is about as surprising and unpredictable as a glacier. And not much more fun. Ratings note The film contains some vulgar humor and violence. Ice Age Continental Drift (PG) Fox (94 min.) Directed by Steve Martino Mike Thurmeier. With the voices of Ray Romano Queen Latifah Denis Leary John Leguizamo Peter Dinklage Jennifer Lopez Wanda Sykes. Now playing in New Jersey.

CAST Ray Romano Denis Leary Queen Latifah John Leguizamo LENGTH 127 Whenever I watch an ""Ice Age"" movie I understand how my mother felt whenever I zoned out in front of the television after school. ""Speed Racer"" and the ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoons looked like mind-rotting junk to Mom but in the end I turned out fine -- gainfully employed functionally literate -- and most likely so will the millions of kids raised on ""Ice Age."" But boy do these movies bug me. Partly its because theyre so loud incoherent and sloppily conceived that they make ""Scooby-Doo"" seem like ""Great Expectations."" The fourth ""Ice Age"" installment subtitled ""Continental Drift"" begins like a family sitcom with woolly mammoths Manny (voice of Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) hovering over their teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer). But then Pangaea starts to crack and Manny is stranded on an iceberg with saber-toothed cat Diego (Denis Leary) Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) and Sids doting Granny (Wanda Sykes).

I havent even mentioned the franchises constantly screaming mascot Scrat an acorn-chasing squirrel-rat whose interstitial segments are designed to add nothing to the plot (two have been distributed as stand-alone theatrical shorts).

New Ice hot at foreign box office Ice Age Continental Drift"" is melting the hearts of foreign moviegoers. The animated film already has grossed 198 million overseas. The fourth installment in 20th Century Foxs popular franchise doesnt hit theaters in the United States until Friday but the 3-D movie is on its way to becoming a global hit. This weekend the film about three Paleolithic mammals played in 48 foreign countries and collected 80.6 million. The film performed especially well in Germany where it had the biggest opening of the year in that country with 14.5 million in ticket sales. The picture continued to do strong business in Mexico and France where it debuted last weekend with ticket sales falling only 27 percent in the European country. The family film was the No. 1 option in a number of international markets beating ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" in 14 locations such as Argentina and Colombia. Next weekend the film will open in an additional 29 foreign countries including the United Kingdom and Russia. It appears the fourth ""Ice Age"" movie will prove to be as popular abroad as its predecessors. The third installment in the series grossed an impressive 690.1 million internationally in 2009 -- accounting for roughly 78 percent of its worldwide tally. -- Los Angeles Times MoviesOur critics top 20 favorite movies Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Photo 20th Century Fox Licensing/Merch Diego (left voiced by Denis Leary) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez) are in love in the fourth ""Ice Age."" ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" does accurately convey a sense of prehistoric times. Carbon-dating techniques peg its inspiration to approximately 2006 when movies about pirates and Tyler Perry still seemed relatively new. In the fourth installment of the comedy series that is mainly loved by countries that arent very funny (Denmark Austria Russia) Manny the mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) frets about his teen daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) as she tries to arrange a date with a boy mammoth (Drake). Just after wishing she didnt have a dad she doesnt as she and her mom Ellie (Queen Latifah) watch Manny drift away/escape from them on an ice floe that breaks off and floats out to sea. Joining Manny on his ice raft are Diego (Denis Leary) the saber-toothed tiger Sid (John Leguizamo) the neurotic sloth and a new character Sids ratty granny (Wanda Sykes). Shes dirty of mind as well as body (when she takes a swim in the ocean an oil slick of her corporal juices forms around her). Sykes has a funny voice but Granny is just a sassy-talking comedy cliche who would be right at home in a Madea movie. Peaches and her crew get stuck in a dull subplot that amounts to her chatting with her friends and mildly offending one of them. Mildly more diverting is the main story in which Manny and friends run into a gang of pirates commanding an iceberg like a ship. The leader is a homicidal giant ape voiced in a bit of puckishness that will be lost on the kids by subcompact-size actor Peter Dinklage. Dinklage gives it his all but his voice isnt all that interesting (and that of Jennifer Lopez as Diegos love interest is utterly bland). Also the apes hair which is supposed to resemble a pirate-y tricorn hat looks more like a mortarboard leaving an impression of a slightly weird math professor from Oxford instead of a dangerous maniac. His fellow scurvy buccaneers are given nothing to do except be background idiots. The quality of the series is fairly con-sistent and the last episode brought in 900 million worldwide. But the international nature of the property for that is what it is means a bias toward dull simple slapstick (or in the case of the squirrel Scrat the ever-hopeful pursuer of acorns scratstick). About the fourth time someone makes a false move and ends up sliding down an enormous icy slope as though on a roller coaster I checked my watch and the movie was still only 20 minutes old. Fortunately that meant only 60 minutes to go not including credits. (Dont be late though The best part of ""Ice Age 4"" happens before it begins with a funny five-minute short featuring the Simpsons). Though the movie also contains bright references to ""The Odyssey"" and ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" its habit of stopping the action for sight gags means that to an adult or a native English speaker it feels longer than it is. Popping from one silly set piece to another is all that really concerns the screenwriters. A chipmunk army appears for no reason except to amp up the cuteness and Sid turns out to speak fluent chipmunk because this yields a silly scene of him dancing madly and speaking gibberish. At best the film serves up mild chuckles with occasional cute jokes (Manny worries that his daughter is growing up too fast -- ""the next thing you know shes piercing her trunk"") and wordplay (the pirate captain Gutt is so named because he likes to slice open his enemies so that ""your innards become your outards""). Scrats quest for an acorn-laden paradise (called ""Scrat-lantis"" which to me sounds more like something youd put on jock itch) provides a funny climactic moment. Yet though the cast includes some talented people -- and also Joy Behar -- too much of the dialogue theyre working with consists of slightly dated attempts to sound hip ""How sick was that?"" ""Yo that was insane"" I do hope this is the last time anyone ever thinks hes being clever because he sets up his two-word riposte by saying ""Two words.""

Starring Ray Romano Denis Leary John Leguizamo Wanda Sykes Director Steve Martino Mike Thurmeier Running time 134 Release Opened Jul 13 2012  Editorial Review A franchise that avoids extinctionBy Sean OConnellFriday July 13 2012Five minutes into ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" kindhearted but accident-prone Sid the Sloth (voice of John Leguizamo) riffs a joke that summarizes the franchise. Hes telling a new character how he and his glacial mates fought dinosaurs in the previous installment summarizing ""It didnt make sense but it sure was exciting."" No truer phrase has ever been said about this lucrative animated series. Logic may be extinct but boy do these movies whiz by like ice cubes zipping across a linoleum floor. Much like ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" the fourth ""Ice Age"" freshens up the 10-year-old franchise by shunning easy pop-culture jokes and embracing its weird side. Critics are quick to praise the venerable Pixar studio for pioneering new territory with the feminist spirit of ""Brave."" But their creative rivals at DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox should be similarly championed for thinking outside the box with their established franchises particularly when such abstract thought works as well as it does here. ""Continental Drift"" doesnt contain anything as zeitgeist-defining as ""Madagascars"" catchy earworm ""Afro Circus"" (polka dot polka dot polka dot afro). But it does sling an assembly line of head-scratchingly strange and consistently funny jokes at its audience as it rockets along. Monkey pirates? Check. A lost continent made up entirely of acorns? Check. A thrilling action sequence set in the belly of a whale that dares to mimic Walt Disneys 1940 classic ""Pinocchio""? Sure why not. Previous ""Ice Age"" installments drew inspiration from our planets climate changes and ""Continental Drift"" is no different. Here fissures caused by volcanic fault lines separate franchise regulars Sid Diego (Denis Leary) and Manny (Ray Romano) from the latters family -- wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) and teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer). Efforts to reunite at a sinking land bridge force Manny and crew to battle Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) a menacing ape who rules the Seven Seas from his pirate-ship-shaped iceberg. ""Continental Drift"" does fall victim to an avoidable sequel trap by adding too many new faces at the expense of existing characters. Jennifer Lopez brings romantic chemistry as Shira an albino tiger in Gutts crew who ends up being a feisty love interest for Diego. And Wanda Sykes creates the funniest character in ""Ice Age"" history as Sids Granny a seemingly confused sloth whos far more intelligent than she lets on. But we spend so much time deciphering these new characters that Latifahs Ellie and even Romanos Manny are all but left in the dust. Longtime ""Ice Age"" screenwriter Michael Berg and newcomer Jason Fuchs make passing swipes at standard emotional messages about the bonds of friendship and family but these life lessons are reduced to bite-size bon mots were asked to rapidly digest en route to the next action sequence. What ""Continental Drift"" lacks in character development however it makes up for in visual wizardry. The animation is spectacular and the 3-D is some of the best Ive seen this year. Animation lends itself to creative 3-D trickery and co-directors Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier tweak their visuals so that every tusk trunk and saber tooth extends into our laps. The team also does more with ice and water than they ever have before. One long fight sequence against a giant crab in the middle of a choppy ocean alone justifies the price of a 3-D upgrade. From a studios perspective ""Ice Age"" sequels are no-brainers. Each new chapter manages to improve on the box-office fortunes of its immediate predecessor. But that doesnt mean the sequels have to be dumb. ""Continental Drift"" is energetic inventive and frequently amusing. And in Hollywoods current age of remakes and reboots thats pretty cool. Contains mild rude humor and action/peril.

"Movie review Ice Age Continental Drift catches new wave - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Ice Age Continental Drift catches new waveAfter the problematic Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs Continental Drift is on uh firmer footing as the animals try to find each other after being separated by the creation of the continents. This 3-D installment is still visually appealing and easy for children to follow.July 12 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Manny (Ray Romano) Diego (Denis Leary) and Sid (John Leguizamo) return... (Blue Sky Studios 20th Century...)When a woolly mammoth cops an attitude and smirks ""Its not like its the end of the world"" there is certain to be trouble ahead. Or in the case of the 3-D animated""Ice Age Continental Drift""a whole lotta trouble.A whole lotta shakin too especially after Scrat that acorn-obsessed saber-toothed squirrel (voiced by Chris Wedge) manages to crack the ice which creates the continents and triggers the breakup of the polar icecaps. So much for global warming.The film was co-directed by Steve Martino (""Robots"") and Michael Thurmeier (""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs""co-director) from a screenplay by Michael Berg who co-wrote the original ""Ice Age"" and Jason Fuchs making his feature debut. The fourth edition in this solid if not overly scintillating franchise is an improvement over No. 3 2009s ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" which completely lost it when the Ice Age went tropical.In ""Continental Drift"" the filmmakers have gone a little crazy too but in a good way. Smack dab in the middle of things theres a big Broadway-style number involving pirates. Its a frivolous but fabulous bit that seems one-part homage to Disneys animated musicals and one-part nod to Disneys ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies yet it works as an excellent diversion and not just because of the music. The real kick thank you ""Game of Thrones"" is that Peter Dinklage has come aboard as the fiercest baddest pirate captain ever and he sings.Captain Gutt is a crusty old orangutan with a sinister grin seriously lethal fingernails (""thems what do the gutting arrr"") and a motley crew a except for the silver saber-toothed babe Shira (Jennifer Lopez). For those wondering why there are suddenly pirates in prehistoric times well this is probably the wrong movie for you.The old standbys are back but thanks to Scrat things are a disaster. Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) and his truculent teenager Peaches (Keke Palmer) are at odds over her dating. A hunky Ethan (Drake) is the apple of her eye something her best friend Louis (Josh Gad) a mole hog gets mopey over. Sid the sloths (John Leguizamo) estranged parents have stopped by long enough to drop off Granny (Wanda Sykes sounding like her stand-up self but G-rated). Macho saber-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary) is having a midlife crisis wondering if being a bachelor is really all its cracked up to be.Before anything can be resolved everything literally cracks up. Mountains start crumbling icebergs start breaking apart and within moments Peaches and mom Ellie (Queen Latifah) are left on land while Manny Diego Sid and Granny are clinging to a chunk of iceberg on the high seas. Captain Gutt with his cold heart soon rides out of the mists and the fun begins.""Ice Ages"" stories are fundamentally all about family and there is no messing with that principle at this point in the game. Its all geared to be easily consumed by little ones there are morals to the story and the jokes are built on the animation antics rather than double entendres or pop culture cleverness. That means Mannys raison detre is simple a get back to Ellie and Peaches because that is what good dads and husbands do we are told in case there was some confusion on those responsibilities.Captain Gutt has other ideas in mind. Schemes and more schemes follow as do sirens in various prehistoric guises. There are many standoffs and sword fights planks to walk and 3-D pranks to play.From its 2002 beginning the look of the film franchise has always been one of its strong points and ""Continental Drift"" takes it up a notch. The high-seas action and the way in which old Mother Earth is falling apart are very cool in their execution and make for great watching. The dialogue is sometimes too sluggish and definitely too preachy the ending is a little too sappy yet somehow this strange collection of prehistoric critters and their completely illogical life are consistently likable if not quite lovable.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--------------------Ice Age Continental DriftMPAA rating PG for mild rude humor and action/perilRunning time 1 hour 27 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESIce Age Dawn of the DinosaursJuly 1 2009Setting climate for comedy and issuesNovember 21 2006Fame snowballs for Ice Ages Scrat on new DVDNovember 25 2002MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-ice-age-continental-drift-20120713,0,1407969.story",200,iceagecontinentaldrift8,iceagecontinentaldrift,latimes

No one seems to be piloting the boat which is an apt metaphor for the film.Blue Sky Studios/20th Century FoxManny (Ray Romano) left Diego (Denis Leary) and Sid (John Leguizamo) are joined by new characters Granny (Wanda Sykes) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez).EnlargeCloseBlue Sky Studios/20th Century FoxManny (Ray Romano) left Diego (Denis Leary) and Sid (John Leguizamo) are joined by new characters Granny (Wanda Sykes) and Shira (Jennifer Lopez).Sponsored LinksThis fourth installment featuring the computer-animated prehistoric critters is aimless and derivative. While the first Ice Age movie in 2002 was inventive and cute theres far too little here thats fresh.This sequels premise -- the cataclysmic rift that tore apart the prehistoric super-continent Pangaea -- rarely satisfies viewers of any age. The filmmakers seem to be banking on the notion that familiarity breeds contented kids. But the key here is banking. Ice Age is one of the most successful film franchises ever so its understandable that studio execs would want to milk it. But they shouldnt keep feeding audiences the same old story modified slightly with just a few new voices added.Returning are Ray Romano as Manny the dependable woolly mammoth and his mate Ellie (Queen Latifah). They are the parents of rebellious teen Peaches (Keke Palmer). Also back is Sid the bumbling sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the slick saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary).Some hip-hop stars have joined the vocal mix including Drake as a cool mammoth and Nicki Minaj as a member of his airheaded coterie. Jennifer Lopez has a dull role as Shira a tiger who falls for Diego.Scrat the squirrel-rat remains focused on tracking his errant acorn. This time he triggers a continental divide that spurs the adventures. The 3-D effects seem to be trying to make up for the lackluster plot aggressively deployed during extended chase scenes.About the movieIce Age Continental Drift out of fourStars Ray Romano Denis Leary John Leguizamo Jennifer Lopez Queen Latifah Director Steve Martino and Mark ThurmeierDistributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for mild rude humor and action/peril Running time 1 hour 27 minutes Opens Friday nationwideMuch of the humor is targeted at very young kids. And for a film that is all about family bonds it is surprisingly mean-spirited toward Sids grandmother (Wanda Sykes) who appears to have the prehistoric animal version of Alzheimers. Fox has attached a hilarious Simpsons short feature prior to this film. Sans words and set largely in the Ayn Rand School for Tots the brief tale is far more clever and whimsical than any sequence in Ice Age.

The gang goes on another adventure this time battling sea creatures and pirates after their continent breaks loose in ""Ice Age Continental Drift."" Photo 20th Century Fox Ice Age Continental Drift review mostly nutty 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Ice Age Continental Drift Animation. Directed by Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier. Starring the voices of Ray Romano Denis Leary and John Leguizamo. (PG. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Somewhere near the nutty start of the nutty ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" Sid the Sloth (voiced as usual by a nutty John Leguizamo) delivers the movies most charming and self-aware bit of dialogue. Not to say the nuttiest. Describing his similarly nutty adventures in the previous installment of the franchise he tells his toothless granny ""We fought dinosaurs in the Ice Age It didnt make sense but it sure was exciting"" And that says it all about the fourth installment of the animated series that follows a rambunctious band of multi-species buddies as they encounter all sorts of excitement in the distant past. No dinosaurs this time but something even more ludicrous occurs Pangaea breaks apart about 200 million years late. As dramatized in the opening sequence its snapped into pieces by Scrat the squirrel in pursuit of an acorn at the Earths core thus driving plate tectonics into an unstoppable centrifugal frenzy. Meanwhile up on the crust woolly mammoths Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) bicker with teen daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) over a cute proboscidean with frosted hair (Drake) and his clan of snotty friends (among them Nicki Minaj). When the super-continent cracks cataclysmically beneath them Manny Sid and Diego the saber-toothed cat (Denis Leary) get separated from the gang bobbing away on an ice floe. Then pirates appear. The good stuff Wanda Sykes as the aforementioned gummy grandma her innate crustiness finding a perfect match in this small cranky animated leaf-eater. The less-good stuff the pirates who are so blandly and predictably drawn that they sap all the personality out of Peter Dinklage (as an ugly ape skipper) which isnt easy. And the plot which just barrels forward with very few surprises. ""Continental Drift"" also includes a short that is a hilarious and silent ""Simpsons"" tale tracking baby Maggies day at the Ayn Rand School for Tots where she encounters a paste-eating loser and a butterfly assassin. Its only a few minutes long but those few minutes boast more imagination pathos and suspense than the entire film that follows. Amy Biancolli is a Hearst movie writer.

"Shivering their timbers in Ice Age - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Shivering their timbers in Ice Age Share Tweet Share Tweet By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent | 07.12.12 | 402 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters for Ice Age Continental Drift Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Early on in ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" the animated franchises fourth entry John Leguizamos Sid the sloth has a quick funny aside about the dinosaur-themed preceding installment. ""It didnt make sense"" he says in his familiar goofball lisp. ""But it sure was exciting."" The line might as well be the filmmakers cheery mantra for the entire enterprise here as they drop Sid Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) and saber tooth Diego (Denis Leary) into a pirate tale that couldnt feel any more arbitrarily conceived. And whos got time to give the prehistoric trio genuinely engaging new business to tend to when theres a whole crew literally of new characters to introduce? It makes you wonder if the series animators who took time out for ""Rio"" just before this arent so secretly yearning to sail different creative waters. The story opens with acorn-fixated Scrat the squirrel wreaking planet-core havoc that comically ends the world as the group knows it. Put another way goodbye Pangea. (Oh Scrat youre the closest thing weve got these days to classic Looney Tunes.) Soon Manny Sid Diego and Sids tag-along granny (Wanda Sykes sassing exhaustingly) find themselves cast adrift on a broken-off ice shelf violently knocked about in a sequence thats a 3-D dazzler. Manny gives his paternal neuroticism a rest the group bickers with renewed situationally charged zing and they generally remind us why weve enjoyed their bonding and bumbling for a decade. Their goal is to get back to Mannys mate Ellie (Queen Latifah) and their restless-teen baby girl Peaches (Keke Palmer). But first they have to spend a while - a looong while - tangling with those pirates notably simian Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage ""Game of Thrones"") and his tigress first mate Shira (Jennifer Lopez). Dinklage works hard and his gold-toothed monkey mariner is amusingly designed but its not nearly enough to shake the sense that were watching elaborate filler. (J. Los conflicted character is completely generic and wedged-in bit players like Nicki Minaj and Drake are similarly disposable.) When Manny and pals finally head off in a chiseled-glacier getaway ship - another swell visual sequence incidentally complete with trippy Sirens - it feels less like theyre escaping the bad guys than a bad middle act. Speaking of arbitrary ""Ice Age"" corporate stablemate ""The Simpsons"" supplies an opening short a 3-D look at baby Maggies misunderstood life at day care. Its weird wonderful and virtually wordless. Its also a welcome throwback to the days when ""The Simpsons"" had more sentiment at its core and wasnt so much about the latest batch of newbie Ivy League writers taking their cues from ""Family Guy.""

Blue Sky Studios photo Blue Sky Studios From left Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) Diego (Denis Leary) and Sid (John Leguizamo) in ""Ice Age Continental Drift."" Blue Sky Studios photo A buddy comedy with a geological-history twist the original ""Ice Age"" was a slick alternative to the weightier toons produced by Pixar. Although the third sequel violated logic by introducing dinosaurs that had been extinct for 65 million years it left Fox sitting on a mountain of cold hard cash. With this unfunny fourth installment the ""Ice Age"" franchise has skidded so far into kiddie land that adults who tread there risk extinction.Wooly mammoth Manny (voice of Ray Romano) is now the Ice Age equivalent of a suburban dad with part-possum wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) and teen daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer). His next-cave neighbors include jaded Diego the saber-tooth tiger (Denis Leary) and witless Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo).While Sid is dealing with the surprise arrival of his hillbilly grandmother (Wanda Sykes) Peaches is dealing with her crush on a popular pachyderm (Drake) and dissing her best friend molehog Louis (Josh Gad). But more serious matters are literally beneath their feet as hungry squirrel Scrat causes a rift in the tectonic plate splitting the territory in two. Manny and his mates are on the other side of the divide from Ellie and Peaches and stuck on an ice floe. When Mannys crew is captured by pirate ape Capt. Gutt (Peter Dinklage) all pretense of a sweet fable has been jettisoned. This already-manic movie degenerates into gibberish as Manny battles the buccaneers to steer a ship back to his family. Many talented performers lend their two cents including Jennifer Lopez as Gutts reluctant sidekick tiger and the object of Diegos affections but theyre stooping to the lowest level of baby-sitter cinema. Beside the wordless scenes with Scrat the only thing that will engage grown-ups is the appended Simpsons short in which Maggie enters daycare and tries to save a butterfly from a bully. Ironically theres more artistic maturity in that brief kiddie caper than in the entirety of ""Ice Age Continental Drift."" In a world where family flicks are split between the inspired and the insipid its time to let Manny and his mates drift out to sea.

Ice Age Contintental Drift Fair Directors Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier. Cast Ray Romano Denis Leary John Leguizamo. Rating PG for mild rude humor and action/peril. Thats certainly true of ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" the fourth film in the franchise directed by Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier. Nothing new under the prehistoric sun here really -- the same guys having another adventure facing down danger with some pretty big stars delivering some pretty funny lines (and some not so funny) along the way. At one point recapping some previous adventures a character says ""And we fought dinosaurs. It didnt make any sense but it was fun."" And thats about the size of it. Top 10 animated voice actors This time around Scrat the little creature forever chasing an acorn in all of the films sets the plot in motion -- and returns throughout. Since hes the worst thing about the ""Ice Age"" movies thats not a good thing. His lust for the acorn leads however improbably to the creation of the continents. And while on the long-term evolutionary scale thats a good thing for the ""Ice Age"" gang its not. The cracking earth separates Manny (Ray Romano) Diego (Denis Leary) and Sid (John Leguizamo) from most of their family and friends shipping them out to sea on a piece of ice along with newcomer Granny (Wanda Sykes) Sids addled grandmother. The trick is to get back difficult enough on a rudderless hunk of ice. But its made even more so by a band of pirates using an iceberg as their ship. Theyre led by Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) who did not get his name because of his belly; the reasons are more nefarious. Among his motley crew is Shira (Jennifer Lopez) a saber-toothed tiger. Just like Sid Wonder where this might lead.... There is a nod to Homers ""Odyssey"" with the quick inclusion of the Sirens but dont get your hopes up -- its just one of many plot elements tossed out along the way not part of a larger narrative. Meanwhile back on land or whats left of it Mannys wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) has to not only take care of their daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) but nurse her through her first crush. She likes Ethan (Aubrey Graham better known as Drake) one of the cool mammoth kids ignoring the obvious affection Louis (Josh Gad) a molehog has for her. Other new additions include Nicki Minaj as a shallow mammoth friend of Ethans and Patrick Stewart as Ariscratle the top of the evolutionary scale of whatever Scrat is with Scrat evidently occupying a much lower place. Its all well done and cute and forgettable. Dinklage has a lot of fun as Gutt -- he even gets to sing -- and the returning cast of characters is reliably solid. One of these days extinction will win out but dont be surprised if there arent a couple more ""Ice Age"" movies before that happens. In a move that shows either confidence or a lack of good sense every showing of ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" is preceded by ""The Longest Daycare"" a short film starring Maggie Simpson of ""The Simpsons."" Its terrific -- sweet sad funny surprising. If youre running late youre safe watching that first and getting your popcorn once ""Ice Age"" has started.

The earth did not move for this reviewer By Mary Pols MaryPolsJuly 12 2012 Share Read Later Fox Ice Age Continental Drift Year 2012 Director Steve Martino Mike Thurmeier Studio 20th Century Fox Actors Ray Romano Denis Leary John Leguizamo Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Ice Age Continental Drift is the fourth film to feature the adventures of the post-dinosaur pre-caveman pals Manny the wooly mammoth Sid the sloth and Deigo the sabertoothed tiger but Fox has been smart enough not to put a number in the title. Without the number how are parents to realize how much of their and their precious childrens precious time has already been spent with these annoying creatures? The good news is were moving right along in terms of natural history. In this film thanks to continental drift caused by the earths shifting plates Manny (Ray Romano) Sid (John Leguizamo) and Diego (Denis Leary) are separated from their friends and family and cast adrift into the ocean on a chunk of ice along with Sids shrewish long-lost grandmother (Wanda Sykes). Obnoxiousness runs in the sloth family. Meanwhile Mannys wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) and their daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) now a hormonal teenager are left behind on uncertain ground. (Whether it is Pangaea or the Earth has already subdivided is unclear.) The rest of the movie involves their attempts to reunite against considerable odds including pirates water spouts and giant waves for Manny et al. and crumbling cliffs and traversing land masses for the ladies. (READ TIMEs review of Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs) Directed by Steve Martino and Mike Thurmeier (the latter of whom also co-directed Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs) this Ice Age features a bounty of new voice talent. Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones The Station Agent) plays Captain Gutt a chimpanzee who leads the scurvy band of pirates. Jennifer Lopez gets to follow in Angelina Jolies Kung Fu Panda feline footsteps playing Captain Gutts first mate a slinky sabertoothed tiger named Shira. (Ways you can tell this is a J.Lo character accessories. Shira wears two turquoise earrings in one ear that play up her eye color.) Parks and Recreations Aziz Ansari Bridesmaids Rebel Wilson and Glees Heather Morris are all in the voice cast but thanks to the constant din of shrieking shrill animals I couldnt match their voices with any of the dozens of irritating characters on either the pirate ship or back on land. Not that it particularly matters; your kids dont care whether that funny lady from The View (Joy Behar) is in their animated flick or who shes playing. They might not mind the visual overload either but the frenetic pace masks an emptiness; this Ice Age is just a collection of slapstick moments and fisticuffs with pauses for Sid to regurgitate food into his paw and show it to everyone. The franchise is just going through the motions at this point and even the animation feels by-the-numbers. (The Ice Age movies are not known for their great animation but even in the third movie Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs there were some beautiful nature sequences whereas there is nothing memorable here.) The usual premise that friends stick together no matter their species has been extended to include lessons for both parents and children. Before plate tectonics intervene Manny is a helicopter parent who spends an inordinate amount of time following Peaches as she attempts to hang with the cool crowd at their gathering place a waterfall. ""Thats a gateway"" Manny frets. (Drug references they mean so much to small children.) Peaches is in the throes of her first crush on another wooly mammoth--""Hes not cute. Hes hot"" she says. At the very moment she shouts ""I wish you werent my father"" the earth begins to shake and the continents start to break apart-daddy is just gone. Talk about your wish fulfillment. While Peaches learns to regret her harsh words Manny comes to realize he needs to trust his capable child more just as Marlin did in Finding Nemo even if Ice Age lacks the wit and loveliness of spirit that made Nemo so special. (READ TIMEs take on why Ice Age was hot in 2002) So mammoths theyre just like us and not just while at loggerheads with offspring. Sid the sloth has to deal with the responsibility of aging grandparents (Grandma has dementia). And Diego the crotchety saber-toothed tiger (Learys voice work is the best in the film) finally finds love with sleek Shira. Everybody makes personal progress in this movie. All this anthropomorphizing is commonplace in movies for kids obviously but in Ice Age its particularly grating because it reflects not so much real human behavior as human behavior as put forth by our pop culture. The pirate business is pulled straight from Pirates of the Caribbean and the teen tantrums feel ripped from a Nickelodeons sitcom. ""Stress is so stressful"" one of the teen mammoths says. That profundity is so profound. Needless to say I am looking forward to Ice Age Dawn of Meat-Eating Man. Also needless to say kids are likely to judge this Ice Age far less harshly. And they will ask you what continental drift means so there is at least that modicum of learning involved.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Preceded by a Simpsons short shot in 3-D--perhaps the only thing more superfluous than a fourth Ice Age movie--Ice Age Continental Drift finds a retinue of vaguely contemporaneous animals coping with life in the post-Pangaea age. The core Ice Age cast--wooly mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) sabertooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and sloth Sid (John Leguizamo)--are set adrift sailing the high seas on a chunk of ice until they collide with a bellicose primate (Peter Dinklage). Meanwhile on land Mannys daughter (Keke Palmer) trudges toward a land bridge as the continental shelf bears down on her family and friends with alarming geologically improbable speed. The matter of whether the world needs a fourth Ice Age movie pales beside the question of why there were three before it but Continental Drift feels less like an extension of a theatrical franchise than an episode of a middling TV cartoon lolling around on territory thats already been settled. Jokes are recycled so frequently its as if comedy writing was eating a hole in the ozone layer If the audience had a nickel for every time a character on one side of the frame says something could never happen as it simultaneously happens on the other side of the frame theyd have enough to pay the surcharge for the movies badly implemented 3-D. On paper Continental Drift boasts a jaw-dropping voice cast including but not limited to Jennifer Lopez Patrick Stewart Wanda Sykes Aziz Ansari Simon Pegg Nick Frost Nicki Minaj Drake and Alan Tudyk. But in practice the overstuffed ensemble leaves the cast no room to distinguish themselves and directors Steve Martino and Michael Thurmeier dont seem interested in coaxing performances that might render their money stars less identifiable. With the help of some low-end boosting Dinklage musters a decent amount of kid-appropriate menace--although he never does explain his gift for finding chunks of ice shaped like pirate ships--but Romano and Leary mainly sound bored droning through their lines as if theyre simultaneously texting the contractors building the additions on their houses funded by their fat sequel paychecks. But the only person who earned their keep on Ice Age Continental Drift is the MPAA flunky who shoehorned in the line ""Silly rabbit--piracy doesnt pay"" Share Tweet Filed Under Film The Simpsons More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Alps Next Movie Review The Imposter Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

This featurette stars Maggie making her way through the psychological minefield that is the Ayn Rand School for Tots where that creepy unibrow baby makes sport of smashing pretty butterflies with a mallet. As Maggie gets passed over for the ""gifted"" section and plopped down with the ""nothing special"" kids she looks over and sees a glassy-eyed urchin slurping down library paste with gusto. The nothing-special ""Ice Age Continental Drift"" is the library paste of movies -- smooth and flavorless kids eagerly consume it despite its total lack of nutritional value. And while swallowing paste wont do children any harm attentive parents should offer a tastier alternative that might actually do them some good. Also read Ice Age Continental Drift Debuts to 78M at Foreign Box Office Scrat the one moderately amusing character to emerge from the franchise accidentally kicks off the separation of Pangaea into separate landmasses by chasing his precious acorn down to the earths core and causing continental drift. This historical event separates mammoth Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) saber-toothed Diego (Denis Leary) and sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) from their animal companions. And while this trio -- along with Sids batty old Granny (Wanda Sykes) -- battle primate pirate Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his feline first mate Shira (Jennifer Lopez) in their effort to return home Mannys wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) tries to lead everyone to safety while also dealing with the adolescent growing pains of daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer). Life lessons are learned new loves are discovered and cliffs menacingly move closer and closer to the shoreline but almost nothing makes an impact here. Its insulting to think that a movie aimed at children has to be this stultifyingly dull and simplistic and there are certainly enough examples of great kids movies that prove you dont have to. Just look at ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" or ""Spirited Away"" or ""Toy Story 3."" Also read Ice Age Continental Drift Trailer Packs Comedic Heat (Video) Will small children be entertained by ""Ice Age Continental Drift""? Yes. Will they want to watch it over and over again on DVD? Probably. Does that make it any good? Nope. Even next to something like ""Madagascar 3"" the voice cast here feels completely disengaged and one-note. Romano does the exasperated put-upon dad routine Leguizamo plays it dopey and disconnected Leary snarls in a superior tone; lather rinse repeat. Probably the worst of the lot is Queen Latifah whose idea of playing motherly and nurturing is to do the tone of unctuous honey-coated voice that people put on around poodles and three-year-olds. She might as well end every declamation with ""Whos a good boy? WHOS A GOOD BOY?"" Youll find yourself pining for the return of the non-speaking Scrat. So by all means check out ""The Longest Daycare"" which has all the laughs and suspense and wit that this new ""Ice Age"" sorely lacks. And when the short is over you can always ""Continental Drift"" off for a nice air-conditioned nap. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Ice Age Continental Drift | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ice-age-continental-drift ) Ice Age Continental Drift (United States 2012) July 11 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli With the Ice Age movies you get what you expect. This is the fourth installment of a franchise that has been around since 2002. (In this case it was decided against recasting all the voices and re-telling the first story with only a few cosmetic changes.) It is as comfortable and predictable as any Saturday morning cartoon although with higher production values and a spiffier look. Theres nothing in any way offensive about Ice Age Continental Drift just as theres no particular reason to recommend it. As family offerings go its perfectly mediocre. Kids will enjoy themselves and adults wont feel the urge to spend the duration hiding out in the restrooms. Some of the jokes are funny. Some of the action is if not exciting then at least colorful and lively. And as always Scrat the sabertooth squirrel steals the show even though the Wiley Coyote-inspired neer-do-well is only in a handful of segments. This is the second animated movie of the year to take to the high seas (following in the wake of Pirates Band of Misfits). In this case our old friends Manny the Mammoth (voice of Ray Romano) Diego the Sabertooth Tiger (Denis Leary) and Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) run afoul of Pirate Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) when he boards an iceberg theyre using to escape the effects of a continental upheaval. Mannys overriding goal is to get back to land and re-unite with his wife Ellie (Queen Latifa) and teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) but that doesnt coincide with Gutts intentions. The leads to a musical number a tussle a shipwreck a chase and a love story for Diego involving the female tiger Shira (Jennifer Lopez) who is Gutts first officer. On a purely technical level Ice Age Continental Drift is a step behind both of 2012s big budget summer animated offerings Brave and Madagascar 3. This is unsurprising since Pixar and Dreamworks have always produced more visually pleasing efforts than 20th Century Fox. So theres a lot more detail in Brave and Madagascar 3 than in Ice Age Continental Drift although this film is by no means sloppily or haphazardly produced (and it has the best 3-D of them all although as is often the case its an unnecessary frill). Story-wise however its the most pleasing of the three trumping Madagascar 3 in how it employs familiarity and exceeding Brave in pacing and character arcs. Manny finds out a few things about being a dad Peaches learns about friendship and Diego falls in love. The Ice Age vocal mainstays return to lend their talents to this latest installment. They are joined by enough new blood to liven things up including Peter Dinklage Keke Palmer Jennifer Lopez and Wanda Sykes. Of those only Sykes leaves an impression. Playing Sids Granny she has all the best lines and delivered in the actress inimitable sarcastic voice Granny becomes instantly memorable. Almost as memorable as Scrat. Theres little to be said about Ice Age Continental Drift that I havent mentioned in my reviews of Ice Age (2002) Ice Age The Meltdown (2006) or Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009). The sameness of the movies defies deep analysis much as the films themselves fail to do anything significantly different from their predecessors. The films exist as much to sell toys and Happy Meals as to be seen and enjoyed by children. They are what they are and for those who enjoy this kind of thing thats enough. The equation regulating whether or not to see Ice Age Continental Drift is simple. Those who enjoyed one or more of the previous installments are encouraged to go. Those who didnt should stay far away. Ice Age Continental Drift is preceded by a Simpsons short which it must be said shows more genuine humor in its five minutes than the full feature does in seventeen times that much screen time.

Theres a mild educational spin too especially during the films opening gambit about how our planets tectonic plates shifted to create todays continents. Its during one of these drifts that the films unlikely lads Manny the mammoth Diego the sabre-toothed tiger and Sid the comical sloth find themselves separated from friends and family.As on previous occasions Blue Sky Studioss lust for cruel subversive Chuck Jones-style humour and mortality-related quips is very much to the fore and there are some fabulous incidental delights along the way especially a scene involving a disruptive new character called Captain Gutt (the voice of Peter Dinklage) who appears to have been modelled on Tim Currys Frank-N-Furter.

As most of the good jokes have already been told in the first three films the writers and directors seem to have followed the Happy Feet 2 trend of upping the ""gangsta"" and reducing the humour. There is lots of getting down with kids and very little genuine humour. There is enough irrelevant moving to the front and swooping of images to try to justify the extra APS 2 a ticket for a 3D but it really isnt worth it. If I had paid APS 10 for a 3D ticket I would have felt seriously ripped off. Even a APS 6 bargain matinee strikes me as too much for 90 minutes of a very average film. Wait for the DVD because APS 30 plus for a family ticket is not good value.

TWITTER The fourth entry in the animated prehistoric franchise features improved visuals but trades in familiar shtick. Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel gets a well-earned promotion from series mascot to plot catalyst in Ice Age Continental Drift the anticipated fourth entry in the hugely successful computer-animated franchise. As Scrats star rises however the series momentum stalls. Faced with the prospect of deviating from the well-trodden tracks of its predecessors the scriptwriters clearly got cold feet merely substituting kid-friendly pirates for the kid-friendly dinos of 2009s Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs as Manny the woolly mammoth and his prehistoric cohorts embark on yet another epic journey studded with sentimental bromides. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies None of this will matter to the young target audience who will giggle along with the helter-skelter action sequences and the fusillade of wisecracks and sight gags. The last of three animated tentpoles to roll out this summer -- after DreamWorks Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted and Pixars Brave Foxs technically assured 3D offering still can expect a warm reception and successful box office ride. With the core trio of Manny (Ray Romano) Sid the goofy sloth (a hilarious John Leguizamo) and the tiger Diego (Denis Leary) getting a bit long in the tooth -- its nearly 10 years between the first Ice Age and this one -- scriptwriters Michael Berg and Jason Fuchs corral a menagerie of newcomers and shoehorn in several subplots to distract from a musty storyline. In this go-round the world literally falls apart as Scrats (Chris Wedge) Sisyphean pursuit of his prized acorn results in a seismic shift that tears asunder Earths prehistoric supercontinent Pangea. (The filmmakers have as little regard for geological history as they did for paleontology in the previous installment.) VIDEO Ice Age Continental Drift Trailer Teases Peter Dinklages Orangutan Pirate Our mismatched heroes are set adrift on a chunk of ice with Manny separated from his mate Ellie (Queen Latifah) and their now-teenage daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer who also sings the end-credits song ""We Are""). Theyve picked up a troublesome stowaway in the form of Sids Beverly Hillbillies-like granny (Wanda Sykes) while back on shore Peaches is trying to keep up with the cool-kid mammoths (hip-hop star Drake rapper Nicki Minaj and Glee cheerleader Heather Morris) and managing to alienate her best friend Louis a molehog voiced by Josh Gad (star of the Broadway hit The Book of Mormon.) Peter Dinklage voices the best of the new recruits a simian pirate king with very bad teeth named Captain Gutt. His ragtag crew of high-seas marauders which includes a love interest for Diego in Shira the white tiger (Jennifer Lopez) join Mother Nature at her crankiest in trying to thwart Manny and companys journey home. STORY Animation Smackdown Madagascar 3 Brave Ice Age Crowd the Summer Schedule Its familiar drawn-out shtick and the humor lacks the subtlety of the first and best Ice Age but there are some visually inventive high points. The wordless interludes featuring Scrat as slapstick comedian nonpareil not only generate the biggest laughs but provide little oases of aesthetic delight. And theres an unsettling journey through the land of the Sirens where the atmosphere turns dark and weird for just a moment before Steve Martino (Horton Hears a Who) co-directing with Michael Thurmeier steers it back into safer waters. The animation by Foxs Blue Sky Studios improves with each installment and here it is vividly rendered with the design of each prehistoric critter a marvel of state-of-the-art technology down to the last hair.
