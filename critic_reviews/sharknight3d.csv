Their agenda of beer pong water sports and performing in its-great-to-be-young-and-lithe music video montages is interrupted however by an attacking CGI Jaws aided and abetted on land by a Last House on the Left-type conspiracy of peckerwood psychos and backwoods law enforcement. Compounding the abject lack of invention in its choice of villainy is Shark Nights obvious trailing in the wake of the modest success of last years Piranha 3D. But where Alexandre Ajas film made deviant use of the 3D gimmick and piled the atrocities on until reaching an apocalyptic floridity--a biblical plague unleashed on the entirety of Girls Gone Wild/ spring break culture-- Shark Night handled with impersonality by Snakes on a Plane pilot David R. Ellis aspires to nothing more or less than carrying along an audience through a string of unremarkable kills often involving high-jumping fish. The torpor briefly lifts for Donal Logues Sheriff to deliver a madman monologue so shamelessly cut-and-paste (""Theres no such thing as sickness anymore its all moral relativism..."") that it achieves a measure of sublimity.

"Movie review Shark Night 3D This Shark is no Snakes - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Shark Night 3DThis Shark is no SnakesSeptember 03 2011|By Robert Abele | Los Angeles Times Staff Writer Sara Paxton stars in ""Shark Night 3D."" (Steve Dietl / Relativity...)Sharks have it bad enough as endangered misunderstood predators with a terrible public relations image without seeing their serial-killing stardom drowned out by hammy acting and torture-porn villainy. But thats the take-away from ""Shark Night 3D"" a disposable hard-body-count B movie in which party-hearty college students (including ""American Idol"" alum Katharine McPhee) hit the Louisiana bayou for a weekend of looking tan and beautiful so moviegoers can hit the multiplex for low-rent ""Jaws""-knockoff carnage. Writers Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg introduce nefarious hillbilly-accented locals using carefully cultivated sharks in their saltwater lake as a private snuff film factory a ""Deliverance""-meets-""Hostel"" lurch that a pardon the pun a feels like creature-feature bait and switch. Director David R. Ellis gamely tries to bring the same hucksterish energy to the feeding-zoo genre that he did to his notoriously hyped yet sporadically amusing ""Snakes On a Plane"" but apart from an appropriately shark-like keep-moving-or-die filmmaking ethos the shocks are weak (see ""Deep Blue Sea"" for the original and freakier airborne kill). The comin-at-ya 3-D feels more than ever like a vestigial gimmick and theres no Samuel L. Jackson. Stay past the credits though and youll find a tongue-in-cheek rap video recap with the cast a and directed by star Dustin Milligan a that carries the kind of spoofy insouciance missing from the main attraction.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The PG-13 rating serves as a warning for exploitation-horror-hounds Shark Night 3D features no sex no nudity (apart from one guys exposed ass) and surprisingly little gore. But the rating isnt nearly warning enough. It also lacks the tension of a good horror film or the self-aware humor of a fun bad one. It doesnt even live up to the minimal promises of the title There isnt enough shark action it mostly takes place during the day and the 3-D only asserts itself in a couple of shots. By definition a cast-attrition horror film where toothy fish eat attractive people is setting its own bar mighty low. But even so Shark Night 3D barely bothered to show up let alone deliver the minimal goods. After a round of the requisite halfhearted interactions--just enough so audiences can identify The Smarmy Jerk The Shy Hero The Frisky Hottie etc.--seven Tulane University students head to a vacation home on a Louisiana salt-water lake unaware that every time someone dips a toe in the water the ominous underwater shark-cam sequences begin. From the setup to the execution (or more literally executions) director David R. Ellis--who had similar problems with Snakes On A Plane and The Final Destination--seems tonally rudderless and uncommitted to any particular pacing. Simple shots of a boat on the lake two women donning bikini tops or even a character walking to a chair are hacked into jittery music-video mini-montages to spice up the pace. And yet character interactions drag out into excruciatingly dull filler filled with awkward pauses flat acting and laughably portentous looks. When the shark attacks finally start they alternate between campy Piranha 3D-style kills extended Jaws-style stalkings and bafflingly vague bloodless disappearances. (Some deaths feel like they were edited out to maintain the PG-13 rating; how else to explain major characters who silently vanish?) Theres actually a plot reason behind the animal attacks one with a little potential for social commentary but like the rest of the film its brought across in an uncommitted distracted draggy way that zigzags between comedy and torture-porn without handling either mode well. To top it all off Ellis rarely achieves a sense of real threat toward his one-dimensional idiot characters which is amazing given that theyre dying left and right. Its common enough for modern horror films to never provide characters worth caring about but the shark-snacks here are particularly baffling Theyre hyperbolic caricatures one minute and dewy-eyed deliverers of serious melodramatic monologues the next. Worse yet the film tries to invest viewers in their deep internal pain then giggles over their messy demises. Everything about the storyline the shooting the acting and the editing seems like it was determined on the set via a spin on the What Kind Of Film Are We Making Today? wheel. Which ultimately landed on ""One not worth sitting through even for the short length of a couple of shark meals.""

Ellis; Release Date Wide 09/02/2011; Distributor Relativity Media Rogue Pictures Posted September 12 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT A bunch of zero-body-fat co-eds are chum for a shark-infested lake in this uninventive attempt at a B-movie screamer. If youve ever watched a big scary thing attack a scantily clad thing (the fundamental pleasure of schlock cinema) there wont be any thrills left in the well-worn tricks that director David R. Ellis (Snakes on a Plane) pulls out here -- especially since a PG-13 rating keeps things strictly TV-safe. Instead Shark Night 3D is a ho-hum series of kills and lulls so predictable that it doesnt even look like much fun for the sharks; when they open wide they might as well be yawning.

Nobody was expecting ""Shark Night 3D"" to be another ""Jaws"" but with ""Snakes on a Plane"" director David R. Ellis at the helm Id at least hoped for some shameless trashy entertainment. But this limp teens-in-peril fright flick doesnt even deserve to swim in the same bloody waters as ""Piranha 3D""; frankly there were more genuine jolts in ""Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer."" And its not just the gore-and-nudity-unfriendly PG-13 rating to blame either -- apart from the occasional shark leaping toward the 3D camera theres nothing scary going on here so what were left with is a bunch of blandly photogenic and indistinguishable characters taking turns getting eaten up in Louisiana swamp country. The friends who become chum all go to Tulane University where the Introverted Rich Girl (Sara Paxton) invites a bunch of people to her conveniently isolated beach house on a secluded island in the middle of the bayou. Her motley crew of cohorts includes the Nice Guy (Dustin Milligan) the Jock (Sinqua Walls) and his Girlfriend (Alyssa Diaz) the Vain Stud (Chris Zylka) the Bad Girl (Katharine McPhee) and the Nerd (Joel David Moore). Yes these characters actually have names in the movie. But theyre such sketchy outlines of human beings that they dont deserve to have them listed here. Throw in the random-girl-gets-chomped opening from ""Jaws"" the shark-chases-a-water-skier bit from ""Jaws 2"" some mean-looking local bumpkins (Joshua Leonard -- whos quite good in the current ""Higher Ground"" incidentally -- and Chris Carmack) and a feckless local sheriff (Donal Logue) and youve got a thoroughly bland jambalaya of familiar ideas and waterlogged horror conventions. ""Shark Night 3D"" has a grain of a fun idea when it comes to explaining how the sharks got there and what the ulterior motive behind the slaughter is -- hint its got something to do with everybodys favorite week of themed cable TV content -- but by the time the plot gets explained weve already yawned our way through so much by-the-numbers carnage that its hard to care. Director Ellis really should know better in addition to the wonderfully ridiculous ""Snakes on a Plane"" hes the guy behind ""Final Destination 2"" arguably the best of that gimmicky and over-the-top series of mayhem-based thrillers. How can such a master of grade-A junk make sharks in 3-D so utterly unengaging? ""Shark Night 3D"" is the kind of experience that makes returning to school or work seem less grim by comparison.

(Steve Dietl/Everett) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday September 2 2011 1116 AM Title Shark Night 3D Thriller about college kids at a shark-infested lake. With Sara Paxton Donal Logue. Director David R. Ellis (131). PG-13 bloody violence sexuality language. At area theaters.When a studio refuses to screen a film for critics in advance it usually means one thing the movies terrible. Thats okay though; theres often nothing more fun than watching trashy action. But the one crime a B-movie should never commit is boring its audience. By even these low standards ""Shark Night 3D"" is dead in the water.Unlike David Elliss previous forays into the genre like ""Final Destination 2"" and ""Snakes on a Plane"" theres no sense of self-awareness no humor and barely any ""gotcha"" moments. What we get instead is a joyless trudge towards eliminating a bunch of attractive college students (including Joel David Moore Dustin Milligan and ""American Idol""s Katharine McPhee). Sara (Sara Paxton) has brought her Tulane friends to her family vacation house on a giant lake that is inexplicably deserted. But this does make it easier for the two local psychos (Chris Carmack and Joshua Leonard) to release some toothy monsters into the water in order to create their own hillbilly version of ""Shark Week."" When the first victim (Sinqua Walls) has an unpleasant encounter while water-skiing the others have to venture back out on the lake to find the sheriff (Donal Logue) and get help. You can imagine how that goes.With the exception of an utterly blank Paxton Ellis has assembled a better-than-average cast for this kind of thing. Carmack Leonard and Logue in particular are ready to chew more scenery than their aquatic costars. So its especially frustrating that screenwriters Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg give them almost nothing to work with. And frankly it seems like even Ellis gave up early the interpersonal scenes are unmemorable the visuals inept and the action inert. As for those poorly-shot sharks lets just say youll have no qualms about hitting the beach this weekend.If youre expecting a ""Piranha""-type goof or ""Jaws""-style jolts forget it. With the exception of one amusing rant from Logue theres nothing funny or scary or even stupid enough to enjoy here. Really the most defining trait of this movie is that its obscenely expensive.A perfect example of how Hollywood is trying to rip you off with 3D ticket prices ""SN3D"" has exactly two cool scenes each of which lasts about two seconds. So instead of wasting 17 wait for this one to hit DVD bargain bins. It shouldnt take long. Magic Moment Who knew sharks could jump so high?
