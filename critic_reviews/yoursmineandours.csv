To put it simply Yours Mine and Ours is socko family entertainment. Based on actual characters the film is marked by uniform excellence. Literate scripting excellent performances and superior direction are underscored by topnotch production. Based on the human interest story of the early 1960s when Frank Beardsley naval officer and widower with 10 children married Helen North a widow with eight kids director Shavelson and Mort Lachman have fashioned a firstrate script which intermingles adroitly the amusing as well as dramatic angles of mature second love raising a family and adolescence. Lucille Ball plays the widow old enough to know her responsibilities but young enough to want male companionship. Henry Fonda is cast perfectly as the widower. Thereafter the sometimes-awkward always-loving melding of the two families proceeds and many of the children come to the fore. In particular Balls eldest daughter Jennifer leak and Fondas eldest son Timony Mathieson project admirably. Yours Mine and OursProductionUnited Artists/Desilu-Walden.

It stars Lucille Ball as a widowed mother of 8 in San Francisco Henry Fonda as the widowed father of 10 Van Johnson as a bachelor friend of the family and 18 not altogether saccharine children. When Miss Ball is free to cut loose with voice and facial expression from the demands of the script--in a flirting or a drunk scene for example--she is very funny; and when Mr. Fonda has pins in his mouth--hemming the skirt of his 5-year-old--he brings the calm of his presence to the infinite incompetence that keeps buffeting the entire movie. Van Johnson also does his best. But nothing can keep this old-fashioned comedy all right. For one thing although it is only an inflated ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" superimposed on a spoken ""Sound of Music"" and variations on a scene from ""Divorce American Style"" it keeps peeking out from behind its fingers into modern times--drawn to the serious realities of the present in a schizoid pretentious and hypocritical way. Mr. Fonda who is by profession a Navy officer goes on a merry little off-California cruise for example on of all things the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Enterprise his 18-year-old son is drafted; yet there is absolutely no indication in the film that the country is not at peace. There are serious little sermons--pro virginity anti long hair--and a scene with a nun in a parochial school; and yet the film cant resist all sorts of sleazy dirty lines and coy bedroom scenes and smily hesitant conversations about puberty which would (one hopes) alienate just that audience that might enjoy a good old-fashioned comedy about the logistical problems of raising 18 children in a middle-class modern American family. Strangely enough though the film lingers with infinite patience on the things it ought to drop although the pacing is slow and every punchline declares itself a mile away there are one or two swift absurdist touches a scene in which a little boy shakes his siblings ant farm shouting ""I hate ants"" passes almost before one realizes what he is shaking. A piece of dialogue in a crowded bar in which Miss Ball keeps rehearsing the line ""I have eight children"" and an absolute stranger turns to her and says ""Dont look at me. I just got here"" goes by very fast. Then the camera dwells drearily and forever on the fact that Miss Ball is losing her slip. By the end Miss Ball has delivered her 9th child Mr. Fondas 11th and their 19th (""ours""); and the movie is entering its 112th minute. YOURS MINE AND OURS screenplay by Melville Shavelson and Mort Lachman based on a story by Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll Jr.; directed by Mr. Shavelson and produced by Robert F. Blumofe; a Desilu-Walden Production released through United Artists. At the Astor Theater Broadway and 45th Street and the 86th Street East Theater at Third Avenue. Running time 111 minutes.
