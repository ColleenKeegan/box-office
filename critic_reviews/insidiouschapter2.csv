Facebook Twitter Print General topics Horror Show Prisoners Insidious Chapter 2 mom-swapping and more things that go bump in the night by Wesley Morris on September 20 2013 Fear at the movies is like water earth or air. Its elemental. Horror movies are the ideal format to exploit that fear. They make their living off the worst-case scenario death. Often that fear feasts on adolescents and the horny. But its most relentlessly focused on the family. ""Obsessed"" might be the more accurate word. A child fears losing a parent -- to Satan to bogeymen to ghosts to insanity. The parent fears losing a child. Sometimes one simply fears what the other has become -- a child demon and an ax-swinging monster. Scary movies dramatize that terror and exploit that dread -- with tales of possession and abduction and backstabbing literal and otherwise. This month is a bonanza for that kind of family horror movie. There are at least four variations playing in movie theaters right now. Prisoners is the starriest of them and the least convincing by a wide margin (and thats with one of the four movies -- Adore -- being about two mothers who sleep with each others sons). Prisoners concocts a classic nightmare scenario. Two married couples in a sleepy Pennsylvania town celebrate Thanksgiving together. After dinner each couples younger child -- little girls 6 and 7 years old -- go off to play and never return. The police are brought in and a young detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is put on the case. A suspicious young suspect named Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is taken into custody and released. Alex wears windowpane glasses doesnt appear to have washed his hair in weeks and mumbles so softly that I actually found myself leaning forward whenever he opened his mouth. Even the cops know this kid is too obvious to be true. Surely theyve seen Peter Lorre in say M Kevin Spacey in Se7en and whatever it was that Stanley Tucci was doing in The Lovely Bones. For the father of one of the girls letting Alex go must be some kind of farce. His name is Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman). Hes some kind of carpenter-survivalist-truck driver and hes in-effing-tense. Outside the police station Keller incites an altercation with Alex upsetting the boys aunt (Melissa Leo) and causing a scene. When Alex continues his movie-lunatic tribute and whispers something to his assailant Keller explodes some more. With Alex free Keller decides to kidnap him and chain him up inside an abandoned apartment building across town where his plan is to torture him until he breaks. Jackman is still in his phase of high-masculine misery. He has snuffed out the joy that made him a star. He just wants to brood now but its unbecoming. Jackman lacks the lightness that say Mel Gibson could bring to despair. Hes drawn to this idea of vengeance and suffering as rites of maleness. So its good-bye to subtlety and hello to growling in every single scene. The entire performance is an exclamation point and he swings it like a baseball bat. Kellers captive is a secret he keeps from the police his teenage son (Dylan Minnette) and his wife (Maria Bello) who spends the movie depressed on a diet of prescription pills. He chooses to share his poor decision with Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) his friend and the father of the other missing girl. (Viola Davis plays Mrs. Birch.) Theyre men of so many ostensible differences (in class temperament and taste) that youd really like to know what binds their families close enough to make them the sole participants of the biggest meal of the year. The director of Prisoners Denis Villeneuve furnishes this movie with just the right balance of ominous atmosphere and gingerly pacing -- it lasts a highly watchable two and a half hours. He gets considerable help from Roger Deakins whose cinematography gives smoothness and art to the prevailing sense of doom. He can really do wonders with the motif of framing images through windows. A character is photographed seated beside a broken sink so that the sink comes to resemble his head and state of mind. Villeneuve is much better when the images speak than when the characters do. He shares David Finchers affinity for fraying soundscapes and chic-looking apocalypse. He also shares the indifference to being human that made Fincher such a frustrating filmmaker for the first half of his career. The people in Prisoners arent props but they arent entirely people either. Some of the matter is Aaron Guzikowskis screenplay. If you happen to be unlucky enough to figure this movie out after 30 minutes youre stuck rolling your eyes at bad behavior and red herrings. The film is a horror procedural that thinks its an emotional drama. A lot of the action involves Gyllenhaals Detective Loki poking around town and sitting around thinking. You in turn are free to take in his slicked-back hair assorted tattoos and dress shirts buttoned up to the neck and wonder how this hipster wound up a detective in Nowhereville PA. Gyllenhaal appears to know who this guy is and that is almost enough. (""Loki"" though shouldnt be a name that inspires confidence but were assured that he has never not solved a case.) Theres just not enough dramatically on the other side of this movie. Howard and Davis and Bello dont have anything rewarding to do. These are actors too good for their underwritten roles especially Howard and Davis who when asked to complicate the movies moral muck do so with moving complexity. The problem is that you dont believe any of it. We dont know who any of these people are before the girls go missing and the suspense of their absences clarifies little. Keller hunts animals (the film opens with him and his boy shooting the Thanksgiving deer). Daviss character a veterinarian saves them. Theres one moment in which those competing roles threaten to create tension but its dropped. Prisoners is a nutso thriller that inadvertently extends the cable-news narrative that more highly values suffering caused by missing white children than suffering over missing black ones. That imbalance becomes all the more untenable once Keller invites Franklin to accompany him to his homemade jail. Howard is the wrong actor for this kind of reluctant complicity. He can perform it but youre always thinking hed have to know that Jackman must be stopped. That or hed have to go further in than he does. But could we handle a movie in which a black man tortures a white kid until he gets his daughter back? At a relatively cheap 30 million Prisoners can afford to be a little crazy (the finale pulls a hamstring straining for ""nuts"") but not that crazy. You can tell this is a marketplace movie. The more audacious film would have put Davis and Howard in Jackmans and Bellos roles. Theyre the stronger actors. I might have rolled my eyes at that idea before seeing Prisoners because going in itd be hard to believe that a movie could go out of its way to underuse them. Each couple loses a daughter but the story turns into a vehicle for Jackmans rage. This could very easily have been the story of the hole a missing child leaves in two homes. It just applies spackle. Adore is nuts too. Its just as subtlety-averse as Prisoners. But the movie resigns itself to the ludicrousness of its situation and thats actually more chilling. Adore doesnt have a genre to hide in -- or many clothes for that matter. Its just two longtime best friends -- Lil (Naomi Watts) and Roz (Robin Wright) -- in a New South Wales beach town. They find themselves in love with each others sons and the sons (Xavier Samuel plays Lils; James Frecheville plays Rozs) find themselves hopelessly obsessed too. The movie feels shorter than it is. You have the inherent juiciness to thank for that. Christopher Hampton took this plot from Doris Lessings novella The Grandmothers and director Anne Fontaine turns the sexiness up all the way to ""schwing."" This is trash that doesnt care to be more. Lil is the unstable one. Roz is altruistically devoted. The friends affect some mock panic about their sexuality (""Were not lezzos. Are we?""). The possibility exists that the exchange of sons is really the closest these two can get to sex with each other. And yet whatever psychology there is comes exclusively from Wattss heat and Wrights cool. Fontaine tries for insinuating Ingmar Bergman framing and lands at ABBA. Would Fontaine have made this film if the mothers looked like and were as old as Barbra Streisand and Kathy Bates and the sons werent built like surfers? Of course she wouldnt have. She knows that the all-around hotness of the participants settles your stomach. It just leaves her with an enjoyably shallow movie. The boys wind up marrying other women and the movies lack of transition or developed characters lets the truth come as a shock to everyone but the predators -- I mean perpetrators. The movie which is in theaters and available on demand hooks you because the fear it awakens is dumb and plausible at the same time. Now a wifes oedipal nightmare can include her mother-in-laws BFF That was the gist of Lessings story. Here its an afterthought. The movie doesnt care about the wives. What youre left with is a horror film with the helium heartlessness of a nighttime soap opera The Carnality of Evil. Supernatural horror movies usually dont make any sense. Half the time Im not sure their makers even know what theyre up to. But the director James Wan and the screenwriter Leigh Whannell have made enough horror thrillers separately and together (the first Saw and Dead Silence were theirs; Wan made this summers sleeper hit The Conjuring) to have figured out how to keep improving them. Insidious Chapter 2 works according to its own logic and its fun watching the movies hokey premise come together in the final act. You stick with it in part because Wan is confident enough with his staging to actually use the camera frame to tell a story. Most of his peers shoot a bunch of scenes and let the editor make a smoothie. Wan no longer relies on visual gibberish. He has become a classicist in that sense. This is a possession movie starring the characters from the original hit from two years ago. This time focus is on Josh (Patrick Wilson) and the killer ghost that wants to take him over and use him to slay his wife (Rose Byrne) mother (Barbara Hershey) and sons (Ty Simpkins and Andrew Astor). Josh and his elder boy Dalton both have some kind of extrasensory perception which the father has suppressed and the boy is struggling to ignore. But this movie argues that the problem with ESP isnt seeing the dead its the dead seeing you. Theyre so needy. Chapter Two is a good time and a cheesy one too. Red blares from all the decor like a siren. Its in the ironwork the sofas the lampshades and the walls. You cant believe that a home this rife with unhappy souls would also have a pane of scarlet stained glass in a staircase window but thats the kind of movie this is. Theres also the acting of Steve Coulter and the wonderful Lin Shaye as a couple of veteran paranormal experts. These two give this movie its earnest late-70s 1980s soul. I appreciate the ongoing teamwork required of Hershey who has scenes with Byrne and Wilson but also with Angus Sampson and Whannell as ghost-hunting geeks. Oh and theres indoor floor fog too Whats confusing about most possession thrillers is confusing here as well Why? How? Who? Who else? Whos that? But the movie uses humor production design and horror allusions to keep the nonsense within the realm of its own logic. It doesnt quite scare you but its got some not-entirely-cheap moments that goose you. At some point Byrne puts her hands over her mouth and pretty much over her ears. I didnt see her put them over her eyes. But the night I saw this some easy-to-scare girls to my left did that for her. By a wide margin Chapter 2 was no. 1 at the box office last weekend which isnt saying much. Horror films are the cat videos of the U.S. film industry They cant be denied. But this is one of the few whose popularity makes sense. The most terrifying movie now playing has no chance at that kind of success not only because it doesnt have the clever marketing of the Insidious movies but because its transparency feels too real. Blue Caprice reenacts the killing spree of the so-called D.C. sniper and imagines the year or so before two men sat in a cobalt-blue Chevy and killed 10 strangers. Alexandre Moorss film proceeds with a steadily ominous air. It uses music to foster an atmosphere of dread that starts on Caribbean sands and ends with a prison interview. Moors opens with panicked calls to 911 and footage of the crime scenes. The film sums up the entire arc in minutes then jumps backward to Antigua where Lee Boyd Malvo (Tequan Richmond) meets John Allen Muhammad (Isaiah Washington). More than an hour passes before they begin picking off strangers in parking lots and at gas stations. During that time youre watching an apparently mentally ill man seduce a sullen virtually parentless child into a life of crime by dangling the promise of paternity. Washington works with a commanding magnetism. Richmond performs with a difficult blend of innocence menace and steel. Presenting a pair of demons in a manner that doesnt demonize black men is a delicate achievement. It puts us inside their heads but doesnt dare ask us to walk in their shoes. The shootings on Monday at a Washington Navy installation probably make this the wrong time for a director to ask you to remember similar wickedness. But theres a respectful ominousness in the films beauty. I wrote about that after seeing Blue Caprice in January and havent forgotten it. Its the scariest thing Ive seen in a theater in a long time and one of the best films of the year. This is Moorss first feature and he knows what hes doing. The observational coolness has a gathering force. The movie speculates that Muhammad was angry about an ex-wife keeping him from his children. But it doesnt build a bridge from his domestic woes to his act of terror because it cant. Moors instead just allows the images to speak on their own. None speaks more chillingly than those of that title Chevy. Whether its dancing on gravel like a bull about to charge or its taillights are glowing satanically on the interstate you feel its evil. Moors seems to be working from a sense of moral duty more than conventional artistry. He amplifies your sense of fear. You spend the movie afraid of the viciousness both on the screen and beyond it.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Insidious (2011) was a refreshing gearshift from horror director James Wan and screenwriter/actor Leigh Whannell. The pair let the grimy and slapdash Saw series loose upon the scary-movie landscape only to chase it away with the deliberate pacing and careful compositions of Insidious ghost story about a comatose child coveted by evil spirits. Wan followed Insidious with two more haunted-house pictures starring Patrick Wilson this summers critically acclaimed smash hit The Conjuring and now right on its heels Insidious Chapter 2. In light of The Conjurings success the first Insidious now looks both underappreciated (Wan did it there first on a smaller budget and without religious overtones) and inconsequential (its like a sillier dry-run for the later movie). Similarly this sequel feels like both a good-faith effort to further develop the first films story and a hasty continuation no one realized The Conjuring would render irrelevant. Wan revives The Conjurings period-horror flourishes with 80s-set flashbacks that fill in all of the unnecessary details of the Insidious-verse. The follow-up splits up the first films cast into two teams Barbara Hershey as Wilsons mother leads an investigation into her sons haunted past with the help of paranormal investigators who also provide middling comic relief. Meanwhile Wilson himself has just returned from saving his son in the ""Further"" a netherworld between life and death--and his wife Rose Byrne begins to suspect that hes come back not quite right. Wilson surely the Jimmy Stewart of suburban hauntings to Wans carnie-barker Hitchcock has displayed remarkable range in his horror career. He and Byrne make a dream domestic-horror couple; he usually looks stricken with guilt and she usually looks just plain stricken. Here Wilson flips his wheelhouse role from the first Insidious--the slightly ineffectual yet well-meaning husband--into a figure of restless menace. One memorable shot frames his darkened figure against a doorway blocking out natural light and the movie uses subtle make-up effects to mess with Wilsons handsome face. The techniques of the movie then are sound. Wan still moves his camera and composes his shots with a patience that belies his dank Saw origins. But the cinematography isnt as virtuosic this time around--or maybe theres just a limit on how many unbroken shots traveling down a dark hallway can summon the requisite dread. The movie also undermines its own technical grace with ugly words; characters in Whannell/Wan screenplays speak with the first-draft expository bluntness of a cheap 50s thriller letting the characters step on some of the best reveals. While the climactic scenes set within the Further were a weak spot of the original the complicated mechanics of this netherworld (and how it threads into our world) provide some of the sequels cleverest elaborations. Chapter 2s Further is a tricky melange of memory dreams ghosts and time travel--almost like something out of Terry Gilliam or Charlie Kaufman though Wan and Whannell never push it that far. They could have distinguished their sequel by going crazier; instead the movies best and weirdest moments are overpowered by respectability.

That line is uttered during Insidious Chapter 2 James Wans follow-up to his genuinely creepy 2011 hit about a haunted little boy. If it seems familiar it should The big payoff line in the previous film was ""Its not the house that is haunted. Its your son."" So the new version is pretty much the same only slightly less elegant and less impactful.The same could be said of Chapter 2 in general which suffers much the same fundamental problem as horror sequels for time immemorial They go back to wells that just arent that deep.Related Story The Shocking Movie That Had Critics Fleeing Venice Film Fest Theaters Cinematic history is littered with classic horror films throwaway sequels (and sequels of sequels) that are so bad that they nearly sully the memory of their forebears. The greater the heights attained by the initial installment the farther the sequel tends to fall. Take two of the greatest horror films of all time The Exorcist and Rosemarys Baby. Their follow-ups are not only terrible examples of the genre; they may be among the worst films ever made.Exorcist 2 The Heretic offered up a bunch of science-fiction hokum about synchronizing subconsciouses a confused jumble of Christian and Assyrian mythology badly rendered locust plagues and Richard Burton doing the worst B-movie slumming of his career. Its only redeeming moment is the unintended hilarity of watching Burton yell at a Washington D.C. metrobus driver for eating a sandwich instead of driving. And all one really needs to know about the Rosemary sequel is that it was a TV movie of the week starring Patty Duke titled Look Whats Happened to Rosemarys Baby. Those are two of the worst but the list of other offenders is long and undistinguished. Jaws 2 practically remade the original providing evidence that telling essentially the same story with the same characters in the same setting doesnt guarantee that youll have the same success. In Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 director Tobe Hooper decided the best way to follow up the grim grindhouse realism of the original was to make it into a comedy. Poltergeist 2 offered an expanded glimpse into the netherworld that trapped Carol Anne during the first film and added in a creepy skeletal old man and bunch of patently offensive stereotypes about Native American mysticism.Why do these films tend to be so terrible? A few reasons. If its true that shorter means scarier then it should come as no surprise that dragging a horror tale out over multiple installments dilutes its power. Where economical slasher flicks and ghost stories hit quickly and efficiently ending before the viewer can find the invisible strings that good directors use to manipulate their audiences like marionettes sequels tend to open the curtain and show too much. Mystery and uncertainty fuels frights; complicated mythologies and explanations of backstories that were only ever meant to be veiled references dispel those mysteries and work against the forces that made the first movie suspenseful to begin with.But those are artistic concerns which are no match for financial ones. Just try telling a studio exec that theres no more story to be told to follow up a horror flick that made 100 million on a 1.5 million investment--as was the case with Insidious. Those are rates of return thatll give any investor excited goosebumps so who cares if the sequel induces a similar reaction for audiences or not?The fact that the industry makes sequels with no motivation other than avarice is hardly news but horror resists success in that treatment more than any other genre. Part of the issue is that studios treat horror as a genre as an ATM to begin with. The films are cheap to make and provide solid returns even if theyre not big hits. When landmark horror films get made its often an accident of someone lucking out and throwing some money at a director who happens to have vision that extends beyond profits. Horror depends on scares scares depend on surprise and surprises are a rapidly diminishing commodity when dealing with the same characters and the same story. Frankenstein Night of the Living Dead Last House on the Left Halloween Texas Chainsaw Massacre Jaws The Blair Witch Project These are all films made by relative unknowns at or near the beginning of their careers. To be sure some of these films had sequels and not all were bad. Bride of Frankenstein is as much as classic as the original as is Dawn of the Dead. Its probably worth noting that in both of those cases the directors of the originals (James Whale and George Romero) stuck around for the follow-ups which usually isnt the case with the worst sequels.Another influential horror flick made by a then-unknown was Saw directed by James Wan who also made both Insidious movies. And following the usual pattern for Saws sequel Wan stepped back to an executive producer role and the series quickly began its (very long) downward spiral. So Insidious Chapter 2 represents Wans first true foray into making a sequel--as well as yet another example of the many the ways in which films like these are often dead well before arrival. Wan and his usual screenwriter Leigh Whannell are obviously still invested in this story so it at least has the mark of a project that isnt a naked cash-in. At the same time though its the continuation of a story that should be over. After the admirably dark ending of Insidious continuing the narrative undercuts the power of that films final shot by giving seemingly doomed characters an out. More problematic is that in order to make the story work viewers have to spend much of the first half of Chapter 2 killing time with unconvincing interactions between the first films primary characters (anchored by Patrick Wilson) while the originals comic-relief supporting characters (Whannell and Angus Sampson) do more to move the plot along.But heres the main problem Though theres some admirably clever plotting to interweave the films second half with events in the original Insidious its simply not as scary. Despite sharing plenty of DNA with the original and with Wans excellent other 2013 release The Conjuring Wans trademark tricks--the slow tracking shots spooky figures flitting through the background the careful telegraphing of scares--just seem off here.Horror depends on scares scares depend on surprise and surprises are a rapidly diminishing commodity when dealing with the same characters and the same story. Horror sequels are so frequently doomed because their options are so limited. If they try to change things radically like The Exorcist 2 or Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 they strain so ardently to be different that they wind up as embarrassing parodies. Or they can try to offer up more of the same and suffer from the loss of tension that comes with knowing too much. Wan doesnt have to tell us its not the house thats haunted the second time around--we already know.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

"Insidious Chapter 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; insidious-chapter-2 ) Insidious Chapter 2 (United States 2013) September 13 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Insidious Chapter 2 illustrates that regardless of his past success in the horror movie field James Wan is not infallible when it comes to the genre. The second installment of what is likely to become a franchise is disappointing precisely because of Wans recent track record. Insidious was two-thirds of a great movie and The Conjuring was three-thirds of one. Insidious Chapter 2 is not only unnecessary but it commits the cardinal sin of devaluing its predecessor. Since this movie is presented not just as a sequel but as a continuation (at one point it re-creates a scene from the first film from a different perspective) the first Insidious no longer stands alone. It is now weighed down by a second half thats equal parts incoherent tedious and repetitive. The primary purpose of Insidious Chapter 2 is to get the filmmakers out of the corner they wrote themselves into when crafting the end of Insidious. Although the kid Dalton (Ty Simkins) is free from the weird dark ""Further"" the psychic (Lin Shaye) who facilitated his escape is dead and Daltons dad Josh (Patrick Wilson) is trapped with a demonic creature having taken possession of his body. Joshs wife Renai (Rose Byrne) quickly figures out something isnt right but its left up to his mom Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) to pick through the bones of the past and determine whats happening. The goal of Insidious Chapter 2 is to free Josh from the ""Further."" This involves a lot of stumbling around in dark decrepit rooms and corridors and enduring long rambling flashbacks. Not only does Insidious Chapter 2 lack tension (due in large part to its uneven meandering pace) but even the scares are generic and obligatory. Wan who has in the past shown the capability to develop and sustain high levels of suspense falls back on the repeated use of ""boo"" moments with things jumping in front of the camera and Joseph Bisharas score striking loud discordant notes. There are lengthy segments when Insidious Chapter 2 seems unduly influenced by the supernatural aspects of the defunct David Lynch/Mark Frost TV series Twin Peaks. There are demons that cross over and inhabit human bodies for the sole purpose of murder. Theres a freaky other dimension that exists between life and death where spirits can become trapped. That place is ruled by demons and inhabited by strange creatures. The only things missing are dwarfs cherry pie and damn fine cups of coffee. The stakes were elevated in Insidious by the ""child in peril"" element but thats absent here. Until the last act Dalton is all-but-forgotten. In Insidious Chapter 2 its dad in peril which is a less compelling situation. The characters are not well-served by the screenplay (written by Leigh Wannell who was also credited with Insidious). It relegates Josh to the role of an impotent shadow for most of the running time. Renai is marginalized; her sole purpose is to act freaked out and serve as a punching bag for demon-Josh. The actors unsurprisingly seem less invested. Wan has indicated Insidious Chapter 2 might be his last horror film. Regardless of whether or not he returns to this series its clear the studio wants it to continue. The cliffhanger at the end of Insidious was designed to tweak the audience; it didnt demand a follow-up and in fact the need to resolve it is one of the major failings of Chapter 2. Not so with the ending of this movie. Yes theres another cliffhanger but on this occasion its clearly a hook for a Chapter 3. Considering the bad taste left over from installment 2 I have no interest in revisiting this franchise again in the near future. Horror is supposed to be scary and suspenseful (or at least creepy) not confusing and sleep-inducing. The most dispiriting thing is that we know Wan understands this; in this case he just doesnt execute it.

Before moving on to bigger and better things though Wan has cranked out ""Insidious Chapter 2"" guaranteeing another franchises surefire box-office legacy with a hearty helping of convoluted mythology and familiar frights. After a 1986-set prologue plants the seeds for much retcon silliness we pick up right where the first film left off Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) have rescued eldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) from the otherworldly realm of ""the Further"" but Josh didnt return alone as evidenced by the gruesome death of psychic medium Elise (Lin Shaye). Now as the Lamberts home is being investigated the family crashes with Joshs mom (Barbara Hershey) only to discover that things are not as settled as they would seem. From there on out the usual supernatural hijinks ensue. Doors creak open on their own ghostly apparitions appear in corners childrens playthings come to life etc. Did you like it before when Renai was startled by a baby monitor and had to hurry upstairs? How about when nursery rhymes earn an eerie rendition from sources unknown? Then youre in luck. In fairness ""The Conjuring"" sourced its spookiness from a similar bag of tricks but even with Wans clear command of the material the harsh digital lensing makes those gags feel hoarier and the increasing amount of metaphysical backtracking dilutes the few simple jolts that do work this time around. Similarly no one in the cast -- which includes the return of dorky paranormal investigators Specs (co-writer Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) -- steps out of their wide-eyed comfort zone save for Patrick Wilson clearly having a ball in rare creep mode. As the first film tapped into sick-kid woes for some semblance of subtext ""Insidious Chapter 2"" lunges at spousal abuse to carry the same sort of dramatic weight but the maneuver more effectively reminds one of ""The Shining"" which doesnt do any favors to a film that is already tied up with constantly reminding us of its own prologue its own predecessor and by extension ""Poltergeist"" all over again. Wan and Whannells screenplay is bound to the same mythological wheel-spinning that sunk the ""Saw"" and ""Paranormal Activity"" franchises fleshing out backstory at the expense of suspense. The mood suffers with every explanation of why that particular door opened itself that one time and despite a bigger budget (seemingly allotted strictly for the purchase of white sheets and fog machines) even real-world nighttime scenes carry the same chintzy look of adventures occurring within ""the Further."" The addition of some lightly homophobic jokes between Tucker and Specs would be more easily forgiven were the chief villain not then saddled with a regrettably retrograde set of gender issues. With that said everything thats backwards about this sequel cannot keep me from looking forward to where James Wan goes from here. Having clearly established his horror chops I look forward to seeing him try his hand at something new for a change -- that is to say ""Fast amp; Furious 7.""

Grade D The ""Insidious"" filmmakers call the sequel to their 2011 haunted-boy smash ""Insidious Chapter 2"" because they say these movies tell continuous ""back-to-back stories."" They should have called it ""Insidious Chapter 11"" because of its creative bankruptcy. This film lands on a crowded spot in show-biz hell - the circle reserved for sequels that renege on their pledges to the audience. The moviemakers dont even honor the promise that theyll begin right at the point where ""Insidious"" ended. At the close of ""Insidious"" heroic exhausted mother Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) celebrates the return of her young son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) from a gruesome netherworld. Her exultant mood cracks in minutes when she discovers the corpse of paranormal sleuth Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye). Renai suspects that her husband Josh (Patrick Wilson) killed this feisty ghostbuster. The audience knows that a ghost inside Josh made him do it. Instead of immediately putting audiences back in that room with the troubled couple and dead Elise ""Insidious Chapter 2"" kicks off with a clumsy flashback. The episode mostly repeats what we already know - that Josh like Dalton is adept at ""astral projection."" While his spirit traveled through the dimension called ""The Further"" back in 1986 he attracted a parasitic ghost and this creepy old woman still hopes to use his body to re-enter physical life in 2013. The introductory sequence lacks tension humor and pizzazz - so the movie goes instantly off the rails. And the action fails to get on track after a police interrogation that simply recaps Elises death. Is there anything more frustrating than characters who cant learn from past calamities? When Renai Josh and their three kids flee to the sprawling Victorian home of his mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) the victims willful stupidities are as irritating as James Wans bombastic direction. The first night Renai hears a baby-walker go haywire and a piano play itself; the next day she sees an eerie woman in white glide through the house. Why doesnt Renai sweep everybody up and run to the nearest motel? It wouldnt cure Josh but a bright modern room would give ghouls from another dimension fewer places to hide. After rehashing the first film the moviemakers serve up nothing but genre retreads. Those eccentric paranormal-science geeks Specks (screenwriter Leigh Wannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) press Lorraine into helping them contact dead Elise. They want to solve the mystery of who killed her and to find out whats happening to the Lamberts. Unfortunately the script grafts on a hopelessly derivative serial-killer subplot. Think ""Idiots Guide to Psycho."" Compared to ""Insidious Chapter 2"" a Ouija board functions logically. The story degenerates into ugly orgies of crosscutting. While Renai fends off evil spirits at the Lambert house Lorraine Specks and Tucker along with a lower-key savant named Carl (Steve Coulter) make grisly findings in decrepit buildings. In an awkward frenzied climax the movie hops crazily in and out of multiple time spans and dimensions. ""Chapter 2"" neither establishes new rules for paranormal horror nor casts fresh light on old ones. Wan underlines each shock with blaring music and sound effects. He once admitted ""What I like to do with the soundtrack is set you on edge with a really loud ... atonal scratchy violin score mixing with some really weird piano bangs and take that away and all of a sudden youre like What just happened there? "" Wan repeats that ploy ad nauseam. He inflates all his effects aural and visual. Instead of a single creaking rocking horse we get a whole row of them rocking so quickly they could be training for a derby. Many TV ads for movies include lobby interviews with ""real"" filmgoers but ""Insidious Chapter 2"" may boast the first commercial to feature a focus group of collegiate kids wearing finger monitors to check their heartbeats. This movie is a giant step backward for Wan from ""The Conjuring"" and the first ""Insidious."" He doesnt stay on top of his bouncing ball of a narrative and he allows his actors to flounder. He must have directed ""Insidious Chapter 2"" with one eye on those monitors and the other on the box office. Maybe thats why it looks like a film made by someone who couldnt see straight.

As before director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannells wannabe-scary story indulges in innumerable demonic-possession tropes before closing with a ridiculous finale set on an ""astral plane"" known as ""The Further"" where evil spirits lurk. Thats also where paterfamilias Josh (Patrick Wilson) finds his soul trapped at outset leaving his earthly body to be controlled by a mommy phantom who likes to scare the rest of Joshs family--including wife Renai (Rose Byrne) and son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) the latter gifted with the ability to travel in his sleep to The Further--with loud jolt scares involving a noise-making baby walker. Two goofy mediums (Whannell and Angus Sampson) offer deliberate comic relief but most of Chapter 2 is unintentionally hilarious. Characters routinely behave in absurd ways none more so than a team of ghost-hunters nonchalantly rummaging around an abandoned hospital at night with flashlights and shaky-cams. Before a reunion with dead psychic Elise (Lin Shaye) the characters must first uncover the secret of their pesky--and as Renai learns slap-happy--specter which is revealed in a finale that like Wans The Conjuring equally comprises classic horror cliches and mythological mumbo jumbo.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 13 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 13 2013 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by James Wan Written by Leigh Whannel Starring Patrick Wilson Rose Byrne Barbara Hershey Angus Sampson Steve Coulter Classification PG Genre horror Country USA Language English Continuing directly from where 2010s Insidious left off Insidious Chapter 2 follows the further misfortunes of the Lambert family with diminishing insidious rewards.This time schoolteacher dad Josh (Patrick Wilson) songwriter wife Renai (Rose Byrne) and their three kids relocate to the overstuffed Victorian home of Joshs mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) where the sudden onset of fleeting apparitions piano sounds and baby-monitor noises indicate that trouble has returned. Multimedia Insidious Chapter 2 The official trailer video Saw 3D promises in your face gore Clearly Josh who previously ventured into a supernatural realm called the Further (which resembles a big sound stage) has caught a bad case of demonic possession. Despite Joshs glassy homicidal glare and tendency to transport himself abruptly into rooms Renai is slow to recognize the problem.Marginally more astute is Lorraine who once again hires bumbling unfunny ghostbusters Specs (writer Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with a new medium the professorial-looking Carl (Steve Coulter).Though complications are numerous (time travel cross-dressing the return of a character killed in the first movie) theres a dearth of narrative coherence or fresh scares as director James Wan and writer Whannell (creators of the Saw franchise) seem to have succumbed to sophomore sequel lethargy.Whats left is for genre fans to pass their time checking off the filmmakers borrowings (Stanley Kubricks The Shining Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho Steven Spielbergs Poltergeist) while home-renovation buffs can ogle the bizarre clutter of Lorraines residence. Theres an idea here for a cross-genre TV reality show This Old Evil House.

"Insidious 2 movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Insidious Chapter 2  1/2September 12 2013|Michael PhillipsScene from ""Insidious Chapter 2."" (Matt Kennedy)With the crafty ""Insidious"" (2011) and this years exceptional ""The Conjuring"" director James Wan asserted the reliability and profitability of old-school suggestive horror haunted-house division easy on the sadism.Now comes ""Insidious Chapter 2"" which picks up mere moments after the first one. That one ended with Patrick Wilsons demon-possessed family man Josh Lambert throttling fatally the kindly hypnotist played by Lin Shaye. From the hard-working actors perspective its a handy thing being cast in a movie such as ""Insidious"" You get killed off but you can come back as a limbo-dweller or a spirit. Life goes on even when its over.And thats a working definition of most Hollywood film franchises -- theyre something to keep going even when theres no creative need to do so. Director Wans recent comments in interviews about wanting to leave behind the horror genre at least for a while make some sense now that Ive seen ""Insidious 2."" The sequels not bad; its not slovenly. Some of the jolts are effectively staged and filmed and Wan is getting better and better at figuring out what to do with the camera and maneuvering actors within a shot for maximum suspense while letting his design collaborators do the rest. But Leigh Whannells script is a bit of a jumble interweaving flashbacks and present-day action setting up parallel action involving ""real"" world hauntings and simultaneous nightmarish goings-on in the supernatural limbo known as ""the further."" To which the logical follow-up question is the further what?Has Josh gotten rid of his demon self? Hardly Hes like a motel perpetually vacant so that somebody might check in and stay awhile. Rose Byrne returns as his justifiably paranoid wife who keeps losing her children and who runs afoul more than once of that new/old horror trope the insidious baby monitor. Barbara Hersheys also back as Joshs mother who opens her doors to the haunted Lambert family only to find the spirits come with the package.Reliable gotchas are brought out for mini-sequels of their own within this sequel. The bit with an invisible someone playing the family piano? We get that three times at least. Closet doors opening on their own revealing pitch blackness containing...something...in the space between the neatly hanging shirts twice? Three times?Whannell once again writes himself a comic-relief supporting role that of one half of a pair of eager-beaver ghostbusters opposite Angus Sampson. Theyre moderately entertaining. The movies moderately tense though Wan is smart to want to get out of the old dark houses for a while. Until something hideous pulls him back in that is.mjphillipstribune.com""Insidious Chapter 2"" -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of terror and violence and thematic elements)Running time 145Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesInsidious Haunted house or haunted boy?March 31 2011`Saw a nice slice of serial killer horrorOctober 29 2004Too Crowded for Convention Center?

And on the matter of the title theres nothing remotely subtle or sly about this lazy movie ( out of four; rated R; opening Friday nationwide).Coming well after the Saw movies The Conjuring proved Wan is more than capable of making a truly frightening horror film centered on a creepy old home. But this reboot just seems to be going through the motions hoping for undiscriminating and insatiable fans of the genre to lap it up.On top of the movies general incoherence it induces Patrick Wilson fatigue as the second movie in less than two months to star Wilson as an off-putting father drawn to haunted houses. Its a strange niche to be typecast in.With his all-American good looks its clear why Wan would cast Wilson as an incongruous subject for ghostly habitation. And Wilson seems as drawn to ghost stories as they are to him. That may be the spookiest thing about this movie.The story itself is more laughable than chill-inducing.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersPredictability lurks in every dusty nook of this sequel. It incorporates hackneyed tropes --pianos suddenly starting to play childrens toys coming to life the sound of infant screams emanating from baby monitors and that creaky old staple terrifying monsters lurking in the closet. Children are the targets and a malevolent old hag is behind the mayhem. (The killer that does her evil bidding was once a tormented child.)But despite its endless string of cliches Insidious 2 is convoluted illogical and unintentionally stupidly funny.Josh (Patrick Wilson) pops in and out of a parallel demonic spirit realm known as ""The Further."" His wife Renai (Rose Byrne) spends most of the movie aghast and stricken. Its an understandable emotion -- especially when she realizes what a stinker shed signed up for. Spirits are plaguing her family. Rose and Joshs son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) has been overtaken and rendered comatose. Her husband initially saves him by going into ""The Further"" but pops out and may have gruesomely killed kindly ghost-buster Elise (Lin Shaye). Josh seems pretty unmoved by the womans death. But then no one seems particularly troubled by her passing -- though if it werent for her Josh might never have grown up to get married and have kids. In any case Josh has definitely brought back some sort of evil presence from his stint in the great beyond.This time Joshs mom Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) is around in a thankless role that mostly consists of hand-wringing.The movie splits off and follows Lorraine and nerdy ghost-busters Specks (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson). Wilson is divided into ordinary dad Josh and pallid demon-controlled Josh.A medium uses lettered dice to spell out clues in a kind of diabolical Boggle word game.Could that be the next Insidious spinoff? 99 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/19LKPybFall Movies Calendar SeptemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this September.

Photo FilmDistrict MOVIE REVIEW Insidious Chapter 2 Running time 103 minutes. Rated PG-13 (disturbing images violence). At the E-Walk 34th Street others. At the start of ""Insidious Chapter 2"" a young woman opens her mouth to speak and someone elses voice comes out of her. Demonic possession? Nope just some inexplicable dubbing to kick off this clunker of a horror sequel The husky voice of actress Lin Shaye is quite obviously superimposed on a 20-something playing a younger version of her character. Why? Who cares? It wont be the last time these queries come up. I rather liked James Wans original occasionally silly ""Insidious"" -- its creepy use of Tiny Tims ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" still haunts me. But this is one of the more pointless follow-ups ever just an assortment of scary-movie tropes randomly doled out with unavoidable jolts at regular intervals. Its main inspiration seems to be those YouTube prank videos wherein a seemingly placid scene is cut short by a ghoul screaming in your face. We begin where the last film left off Having just rescued their young son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) from the clutches of the ""spirit realm"" parents Renai (Rose Byrne) and Josh (Patrick Wilson) Lambert are dealing with the strangling death of Elise (Shaye) the medium who helped get him back. We know from the first movie that a possessed Josh was the killer but Renai doesnt. Spirits continue to haunt the Lambert family in ""Insidious 2.""Photo FilmDistrict Straightaway cliched supernatural antics start up again. The piano plays on its own baby toys throw themselves around -- then a shrieky ghost woman just ups and punches Renai in the face hilariously belying Joshs advice that ""all you have to do is ignore them and theyll go away."" Dalton meanwhile is perhaps not totally recovered as hes having tin-can-telephone conversations with a shadowy presence in the closet. A question Has no one in this film heard of WD-40? Every door without exception creaks. This is a typical feature of the ""Scooby Doo""-derivative plotting which sees a team of supernatural experts (Steve Coulter Angus Sampson and screenwriter Leigh Whannell) -- and Barbara Hershey as Joshs long-suffering mother -- traipsing from seance to abandoned hospital to haunted house as they track down an Old Man Withers type (Tom Fitzpatrick) who may be the key to solving the Lamberts troubles. Logic reaches its low point when after discovering a room is full of corpses the intrepid investigators make their real find in the corner a trunk full of damning newspaper clippings. Huh? As game as he is the capable Wilson should maybe give the horror movies (he was also in this summers ""The Conjuring"") a rest. Even he looks a little bored by the time he ends up back in the spirit realm which resembles a high school play that went too heavy on the dry ice. A small amount of comic relief is provided by Whannell and Sampson reprising their roles as the late medium Elises snarky sidekicks Specs and Tucker; their juxtaposition of quippy and terrified is the only enjoyable thing about this sequel. Id like to see Whannell pen the two of them a spin-off about these hipster ghost hunters -- ""Insidious 3 Williamsburg.""

"Insidious Chapter 2 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Insidious Chapter 2 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Insidious Chapter 2 Bad 2 stars Director James Wan. Cast Patrick Wilson Rose Byrne Barbara Hershey.Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of terror and violence and thematic elements. By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Sep 12 2013 1037 AM Horror-movie maestro James Wan has had the business side of his craft on lock since he made ""Saw"" in 2004. Since then he and writer partner Leigh Whannell have overseen a parade of sequels and have launched potential blockbuster franchises in ""The Conjuring"" and ""Insidious."" They keep an incredible pace populating the multiplexes with horror films like so many possessed baby dolls rolling off the factory line. At that pace youre bound to get the occasional bum baby doll. And thats what ""Insidious Chapter 2"" amounts to -- a defective product that bypassed inspection as it was rushed to shelves. ""Chapter 2"" starts where 2010s ""Insidious"" left off with the Lambert family fending off evil forces as father and son struggle with their ability to astral project to a spirit realm known as the Further (and their unfortunate proclivity to become vessels for evil spirits). They leave their own spooky house where psychic medium Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) has been found dead under mysterious circumstances and head to grandma Lorraines (Barbara Hershey). There husband and wife Josh and Renai (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) find no respite with poltergeist activities that seem to have followed them. On top of that Josh is acting strange a bit twitchy and plastic which kicks off a deranged transformation orders of magnitude less subtle than Jack Nicholsons descent in ""The Shining"" if you can even imagine such a thing. Renai whos had suspicions from the beginning that Josh brought something back with him from the Further ignores all the telltale warning signs. How many times does your husband have to freak you out? How many ghosts do you have to see with your own eyes? How many times do you have to find your baby screaming before your grab the kids and hightail it out of there? The film shows far more terrors than it suggests which is a shame when its terrors are so tired. All the standard spooks pop up creepy baby toys a piano that plays itself a lady in white roaming the house predictable jump-scares galore. Part of what makes the film such a disappointment is that it arrives fresh on the heels of Wans excellent ""The Conjuring"" which is essentially the same movie malevolent spirits possess a parent a good family is threatened a house is haunted Patrick Wilson shows up and does stuff. Except where ""The Conjuring"" invigorated horror-movie tropes with inventive application and strong characters ""Insidious"" only wallows in them. When you finally get a good long look at the spirits the Lambert family is up against the effect is risible they look about as convincing as the spooks at your local haunted house. It all adds up to a movie thats more funny than it is frightening. And those laughs are largely unintentional.

After launching his career with the cleverly gory first installment in the Saw franchise in 2004 hes continued to crank out effectively lean low-budget chillers like 2007s Death Sentence 2011s Insidious and this summers white-knuckle sensation The Conjuring. Not surprisingly the studio suits took notice Next up the 36-year-olds hot hand will be grabbing the wheel on The Fast and the Furious 7 in which Vin Diesel no doubt will be forced to slice Paul Walkers Achilles tendon before he can step on the gas pedal. Before Wan could segue over to grease-monkeyland though he apparently had one more obligation to scratch off his to-do list the shambling so-so possession sequel Insidious Chapter 2. Picking up where the first movie left off Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannells follow-up reunites us with the unlucky Lambert clan. Mom and dad (Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson) have rescued their son from a demonic netherworld thanks to Lin Shayes smilingly spooky medium Elise. The voyage back from the beyond cost Elise her life and also seems to have let another evil genie out of the bottle. Could that be why Wilsons Josh is acting so strangely? It turns out that he has a haunted past of his own. So his mother (Barbara Hershey) calls in Elises old ghost-busting partner (Steve Coulter) who uses a set of what looks like old Boggle dice to communicate with the spirit world in an attempt to get to the bottom of why this family is such a juicy target for unhappy souls on the other side. A pair of nerdy paranormalists straight out of a lesser Scooby-Doo episode lend a hand. The problem is Wan is reaching into the same old grab bag of shock scares creaky-door sound effects and ominous baby monitor voices he used in the far better original Insidious. Hes recycling the same old tired tropes with diminishing returns. Here the messy story and cartoony performances seem to be the result of the films overriding commercial imperative to wring more bucks out of a franchise that should have begun and ended with the first film. Its lack of both originality and any real memorable moments feels shameless and lazy. Adding insult the movie ends on a cliffhanger guaranteeing that Insidious Chapter 3 will soon be coming to a theater near you. They should quit while they still have some audience goodwill left.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins) the elder son in ""Insidious Chapter 2"" can take heart in knowing that his visitors arent hiding under the bed. (Matt Kennedy) By Michael OSullivan September 12 2013 When we last left the Lamberts the family whose eldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) had been trapped in a comalike state in ""Insidious"" the boy had awakened from his supernatural trance thanks to a rescue mission by his intrepid father. Like a paranormal Navy SEAL Daddy (Patrick Wilson) had metaphorically rappelled under hypnosis into the spirit realm where his son was being held captive by ectoplasmic terrorists. ""Insidious Chapter 2"" picks up the story there. Where do you go with a tale that ended so over the top in a fog-shrouded netherworld called ""The Further""? Apparently even further. Although ""Insidious"" had built up a nice head of suspense for much of the film its final act was absurdly out of proportion to the delicious sense of dread that had been created by director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell who since collaborating on the 2004 ""Saw"" have made a name for themselves as horror auteurs. Here they try to outdo what they did in ""Insidious"" piling on plot twists borrowed from a host of other movies that while in some cases are genuinely creepy turn ""Chapter 2"" into a bustling overly busy mess. Remember ""Poltergeist""? Its essentially the model for both ""Insidious"" films which presuppose a parallel universe beyond the physical one inhabited by malevolent entities who can drift in and out of our world and into whose world we -- or at least some of us -- can also enter willingly or not. That 1982 film posited an alternate ""sphere of consciousness"" that could be entered quite literally by spiritual spelunkers tethered to a rope. Similarly ""Insidious Chapter 2"" features a visit to the Further by someone tied to -- I kid you not -- a piece of string. Talk about String Theory. Just contemplating the physics of this will make your head explode. ""I suppose I should have explained something"" says one of the spirit mediums (Steve Coulter) who is called in to assist the Lamberts when they discover that their nightmares are far from over. ""This isnt an exact science."" No kidding. Those who missed the first film will get a recap in ""Chapter 2"" which centers on the father Josh Lambert who now appears to be haunted instead of Dalton. ""Is something wrong with Daddy?"" the boy asks after Josh starts talking to himself and pulling rotten teeth out of his mouth. Yes kid but its the movie you should be worried about and not your old man. In addition to ""Poltergeist"" ""Insidious Chapter 2"" cribs from ""The Shining"" ""The Exorcist"" ""Psycho"" and other films. If it has to steal at least its from some of the best. The problem is its also reminiscent in parts of ""Mommie Dearest"" and as a friend of mine pointed out ""A Reflection of Fear."" (Yeah I had to look up that 1973 B movie too. Dont Google its plot twist if you dont want a major spoiler.) Certain scenes in ""Insidious Chapter 2"" look like outtakes from a zombie movie with ghouls staggering around in the dark arms outstretched. And you thought this was a simple ghost story? Stick to Wans ""The Conjuring"" (also starring Wilson) for that. Unfortunately that exquisitely restrained fright-fest which is still in theaters is starting to look more and more like a fluke for the filmmaker who seems to be running out of ideas even as he amps up the demand for them. Get ready for even less of them in ""Insidious Chapter 3"" a sequel whose inevitability is ensured by the teaser ending of ""Chapter 2."" But theres only one number that matters here. Considering how creatively bankrupt and stylistically profligate this second installment of the franchise is the new movie should really be called ""Insidious Chapter 11."" 1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains frightening sequences violence and brief crude language. 90 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Malevolent spirits continue to plague the Lambert family. Rated PG-13 (scary imagery) BOTTOM LINE More gruesome acting and ghastly writing in this abysmal sequel from the makers of ""Saw."" CAST Patrick Wilson Rose Byrne Barbara Hershey LENGTH 143 There are some good things to be said about ""Insidious Chapter 2"" though none of them have to do with the acting directing writing lighting sets costumes or effects. As a business model however this burgeoning horror franchise is some kind of masterpiece. It began with 2011s ""Insidious"" a haunted-house story about a father who ventures into a spirit realm called The Further to rescue his son. A clumsy hash of ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" and produced for a visibly low 1.5 million the movie nevertheless benefited from a wide-reaching PG-13 rating and earned 97 million. Thats a return on investment even Bernie Madoff couldnt promise. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? So here comes the sequel ""Insidious Chapter 2."" Josh Lambert is again played by scream king Patrick Wilson (also of ""The Conjuring"") while Rose Byrne returns as his wife Renai. But their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) still has nightmares and the house is still plagued by strange goings-on. Actually the same goings-on crackling baby monitors self-moving toys glimpses of women in Victorian gowns. Grandma Lambert (Barbara Hershey) starts to wonder What if it isnt Josh who came back from the afterlife? The demon-dad angle gives ""Chapter 2"" a chance to rip off ""The Shining"" but it also goes after ""Psycho"" and -- why not? -- ""Mommie Dearest."" All of which might have been wackily entertaining if the whole thing werent so sluggishly paced poorly lit and dispiritingly unoriginal. At times ""Chapter 2"" almost seems like a knowing parody of a lousy horror flick. Its directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell (also playing the ghostbusting assistant Specks) who created the ""Saw"" films; Oren Peli and Jason Blum of the wildly successful ""Paranormal Activity"" series are producers. Clearly these people know what theyre doing. 248 MoviesInsidious Chapter 2 trailer PLOT Malevolent spirits continue to plague the Lambert family. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (scary imagery) CAST Patrick Wilson Rose Byrne Barbara Hershey LENGTH 143 BOTTOM LINE More gruesome acting and ghastly writing in this abysmal sequel from the makers of ""Saw.""

Still if youre a fan of the post-""Poltergeist"" shocks and scares offered up by the first ""Insidious"" then youll be thrilled to hear that ""Chapter 2"" manages to jolt and unsettle without merely repeating itself. Teaming again with writer Leigh Whannell -- who also co-stars as Specks half of the series Frick-and-Frack team of ghost chasers alongside Angus Sampson as Tucker -- Wan picks up right where ""Insidious"" left off. Haunted dad Josh (Patrick Wilson) returns from a parallel dimension full of restless spirits with his son Dalton (Ty Simpkins ""Iron Man 3""). Like Josh Dalton can astrally project while he sleeps and travel to a place between our world and the afterlife where the dead sometimes choose to follow the living back home. ""Insidious"" fans will recall that the earlier film ends with the realization that Josh has become possessed by a ghost so this time around its all about his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) and mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) figuring out whats living in Joshs body and how to get it out. Also read Insidious 2 Social Media Surge Signals Strong Friday Box-Office Debut To get too deeply into the plot details would be to ruin much of the fun that ""Insidious Chapter 2"" has to offer but suffice it to say that Whannell and Wan get the most out of secret rooms abandoned hospitals boarded-up houses creepy basements and dark and foreboding bedroom closets to keep the scares coming. And even if the film never offers the armrest-clutching terror that ""The Conjuring"" did its spooky and funny enough to make for a briskly entertaining experience. Taking a page from ""Paranormal Activity 2"" -- and doing it much much better -- ""Insidious Chapter 2"" uses its predecessor as a jungle gym and unpacks its prepositions going in front behind around about alongside and through the plotline of the first movie to embellish and inform the second one. Wans definitely playing things more tongue-in-cheek here -- he loves framing Wilson in a shadowy way that makes the possessed Josh look like evil incarnate -- but hes also adept at the sudden noises and abrupt appearances and creepy-crawlies that make movies like this date-night staples. Also read Insidious Chapter 2 Trailer Well This Looks Terrifying (Video) This is no actors showcase since the characters have already been established and now its just a matter of learning things screaming reacting in horror fighting off spectral menaces and then screaming some more but Wilson Byrne Hershey and company throw themselves into it with nary a raised eyebrow to be found. They may not be given much to do here but they certainly commit to what theyve got. ""Insidious Chapter 2"" has clearly been designed to appeal to the viewers who loved the first go-round but its a sequel that ventures into enough new and challenging directions that it might even win over a nay-sayer or two.

Starring Patrick Wilson Rose Byrne Barbara Hershey and Steve Coulter. Directed by James Wan. (PG-13. 105 minutes.) Malevolent demons never have been known as early adopters of new technology. When youre busy possessing young souls who has time to drop by the latest Apple product unveil? (Billion-dollar idea The iOuija - a tablet computer that allows users to communicate with the dead. Youre welcome Tim Cook.) The throwback horror genre travels beyond the limits of time and space in ""Insidious Chapter 2"" where one evil spirit haunts a family using two tin cans connected with a string. A videocassette recorder and rocking horses also fit prominently into the plot. Rarely has a film set in the present day used so many products from an old Sears catalog. ""Saw"" co-creator James Wan continues his mission to distance himself from the torture-porn genre by making scary movies that rely on practical effects smart direction and an unapologetic first-date-friendly PG-13 sensibility. ""Insidious 2"" has a few memorable frights a willing cast and a professional crew behind the camera. But even as it succeeds in the moment its hard to get around the fact that the sequel is entirely unnecessary. Wed rather see Wan and his co-conspirators put out something new. Something like ""The Conjuring"" the Wan-directed release that was the biggest unexpected pleasure of the summer movie season. That film set in the 1970s was even more retro capturing the feel of a movie from ""The Exorcist"" era without seeming like an outright theft. ""Insidious 2"" is just more of ""Insidious"" minus the element of surprise. Were reintroduced to the Lambert family whose father and eldest son have the ability to ""astral project"" - entering a limbo-like zone filled with dry ice and angry demons. This time we also learn about Josh Lamberts past discovering his childhood possession captured on video that was surprisingly high-def for 1986. The cans-on-a-string haunting is part of the fresh hell for eldest son Dalton and didnt he take enough abuse in the last film? Fans of the first ""Insidious"" will walk into the theater knowing (1) which family member is possessed and (2) the nature of the supernatural forces. Screenwriter Leigh Whannell tries to compensate by simultaneously adding backstory and new drama. But it feels a little like sandwiching a cupcake with two waffles sprinkled with powdered sugar. (Billion-dollar idea the Belgian Waffle Cake. Youre welcome Jack in the Box.) If ""Insidious 2"" exists solely because ""Insidious 1"" made a ton of money then at least credit Wan for making quality control a priority. A lesser filmmaker would have farmed out the project to a protege with limited talent and raked in a boatload of executive-producer cash for doing minimal work. Wan once again stays engaged and helps his cause with some excellent hires. Much like ""The Conjuring"" the camera work becomes more urgent and threatening as the horror builds as if one of demons were handling the cinematography. Joseph Bisharas piano-heavy score is appropriately menacing and ties into the plot in a subtle but meaningful way. Production design is vital for a good horror film and Jennifer Spence does some exemplary work. Even if there werent a single ghostly presence in this film the green-and-black paisley wallpaper would have brought chills to the steeliest moviegoer. The extra effort extends to some of the actors particularly Patrick Wilson who is convincing as the possessed dad. Barbara Hershey is the resourceful Grandma Lambert. And the people playing evil spirits actually have to act since Wan shuns computer-effect demons in favor of real people with too much lipstick and not enough melanin . Linda Blair would be proud. None of the above should make us look forward to ""Insidious Chapter 3."" (Which will have to come after Wan directs ""Fast amp; Furious 7"" and presumably ""The Conjuring 2."") But if we must live with unnecessary sequels its always better when a pro is in charge. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

TWITTER The filmmaking team behind the original supernatural horror film returns with Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne again co-starring. An unapologetically derivative approach proved no obstacle at the box office for 2011s Insidious so Chapter 2 should equally appeal to undiscriminating audiences although the series would not appear to have franchise potential comparable to director-producer James Wans Saw films. Genre-wise Chapter 2 has the iconic Friday the 13th weekend all to itself among debuts which might boost returns but also might send expectations unrealistically high. In the L.A. area the theatrical run should get a boost from Universal Studios incorporation of an Insidious ""maze"" in its annual Halloween Horror Nights attraction opening Sept. 20. Chapter 2 picks up immediately after the concluding events of Insidious just as Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) Lambert discover the death of family friend and gifted psychic Elise (Lin Shaye) after shes guided Josh on the retrieval of their son Daltons (Ty Simpkins) spirit from the netherworld of some evil astral plane that Elise refers to as ""the Further."" STORY Insidious Chapter 2 Cast Goes Back to the Further at L.A. Premiere Renai and Joshs mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) are just glad that Dalton has recovered from a prolonged coma failing to notice Joshs escalating derangement which only worsens with persistent headaches and sleeplessness. Extended flashbacks predating the first installment establish that Josh was much like his son as a child having fallen victim to evil spirits that haunted his mind and made off with his soul before Elise was able to bring him back to reality apparently unharmed. Even after Elises repeated interventions evil entities continue to bedevil the Lamberts causing havoc in the creepy old family home theyve recently moved back into as Josh slips deeper into paranoia and violence. Lorraine decides to call on Elises former co-investigator Carl (Steve Coulter) as well as her mismatched assistants Specs (screenwriter Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) to root out the source of the haunting. Through a series of highly unlikely coincidences the ghostbusters improbably connect the Lamberts afflictions to an old acquaintance of Lorraines and the malevolent consequences of his traumatic childhood all in an effort to drag Josh back from the precipice of impending catastrophe. VIDEO Insidious Chapter 2 Trailer Patrick Wilson Rose Byrne Are Still Haunted In Chapter 2 the filmmakers essentially replicate the same derivative approach employed in the original stringing together ideas and associations from The Exorcist Poltergeist and numerous other haunters this time with a generous dose of The Shining incorporated as well. Setting aside the movies tediously lame dialogue self-conscious performances and frequently predicable scares the narratives compulsively shifting chronology intermittently manages to engage although it does little to obscure the distracting shortcomings of both plot and character development. Chapter 2s many similarities to Wans The Conjuring -- another haunted-house horror tale that displays many of the same narrative and thematic elements as Insidious -- may have some wondering if hes cannibalizing his own material even though the latter is a far more elegantly accomplished film. (Released earlier in the summer it crossed 100 million in only its third week of release.)  Unflattering comparisons aside the driving force behind a Chapter 3 sequel will likely be determined by ticket sales rather than the intrinsic quality of the material.

With his last helping of old-fashioned ooga booga ""The Conjuring"" still scaring up business in a few hundred theaters James Wan returns with two more hours of seat-clenching scares in ""Insidious Chapter 2"" a modestly scaled and highly pleasurable sequel to Wans low-budget (1.5 million) 2011 smash that should have genre fans begging for thirds. Indeed with a clever coda that suggests how this franchise might easily continue even without the involvement of stars Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne theres no reason to doubt that ""Insidious"" could rival Wans own ""Saw"" series for sheer longevity. In the short term opening in a relatively low-wattage early fall market the PG-13 pic should easily meet or exceed its predecessors 54 million domestic gross without conjuring up ""Conjuring""-sized biz.This story first appeared in the September 17 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. If weve learned anything from Wans two previous films its that evil spirits haunt people not houses. In the first ""Insidious"" that imperiled party appeared to be young Dalton Lambert (Ty Simpkins) son of Josh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) who landed in a coma after being entreated into a spirit world known as ""the further"" by a demonic old hag intent on possessing his soul. Only as a last-minute twist revealed it was actually Josh himself who had been pursued by said demon for decades -- and there was no guarantee she was gone just yet. Fittingly ""Chapter 2"" (again scripted by longtime Wan collaborator Leigh Whannell) begins with an extended flashback to Joshs own childhood and his first encounter with the hypnotist and medium Elise (Lin Shaye) who appeared to die at Joshs strangling hands in the first films final moments. With this new piece of the puzzle in place we jump back to the present picking up (a la ""Halloween II"") exactly where the previous pic left off. Looking to make a fresh start the Lamberts have packed their bags and moved in with Joshs mom Lorraine (Barbara Hershey getting a welcome expanded role this time) who lives in just the sort of draughty Victorian fixer-upper that allows Wan and Whannells imaginations to run wild. It quickly becomes apparent that the Lamberts have not arrived unaccompanied. If the first ""Insidious"" often felt like an affectionate hat-tip to ""The Shining"" with its gifted child able to commune with the undead (via the nocturnal art of astral projection) ""Chapter 2"" continues the homage by having Wilson go full Jack Torrance on us as the seemingly upstanding Josh starts to seem less and less himself and possibly turning into something quite dangerous. That plus the appearance of some very unwanted house guests -- like a ghoulish bride who gives Renai a good thrashing about the living room -- prompt Lorraine to enlist some backup in the form of Elises erstwhile sidekicks Specks (Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson). Eventually joined by another blast from the past -- the paranormal investigator Carl (a very good Steve Coulter) who first investigated the Lambert case with Elise all those years ago -- further into the further they go. Wan and Whannell once again spin a ripping good ghost story here populated by lots of restless spirits who ended their time among the living badly a mother only Norman Bates could love and a lyrical bit of time travel borrowed from Proust. Theyre terrific pastiche artists freely raiding our collective storehouse of horror-movie memories and arranging them in fresh unexpected ways. Even their own work is up for grabs since ""The Conjuring"" in many ways resembled a period inversion of ""Insidious"" with Wilson as ghost hunter rather than hunted. But where so many sequels seem like mere remakes of their predecessors with bigger budgets and less imagination ""Insidious"" Chapter 2"" feels like a genuine continuation of characters we enjoyed getting to know the first time around and wouldnt at all mind returning to again. If Wan is better than most genre directors when it comes to actors  hes even better with mysteriously possessed inanimate objects bringing the audiences neck hair to attention with each creaking doorjamb swaying chandelier and squawking transistor radio. He understands the innately creepy value of antiques -- objects that we know were quite literally touched by the dead -- and anything associated with childhood that other irrecoverable past. Here that simplest feat of sandbox engineering a tin-can telephone becomes perhaps the movies most accursed object -- and something of a metaphor for Wans joyously analog thrill-making in the digital era. Working again with cinematographer John Leonetti (who shot both ""Insidious"" and ""The Conjuring"") Wan makes artfully eerie business out of a Steadicam slowly prowling its way 270 or 360 degrees around a subject. Sound designer and editor Joe Dzuban also deserves kudos for his invaluable contribution to the pics pervasively unsettling atmosphere.

"Review Insidious Chapter 2 adds nothing to the story - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Insidious Chapter 2 adds nothing to the story Insidious Chapter 2 Matt Kennedy / EPK Danielle Bisutti as Michelle in FilmDistricts ""Insidious Chapter 2."" Danielle Bisutti as Michelle in FilmDistricts ""Insidious Chapter 2."" (Matt Kennedy / EPK) Robert Abele If ""The Conjuring"" and ""Insidious"" director James Wan ever made a romantic comedy one imagines hed still set it in a creaky old two-story with dark corners and foreboding armoires. For his latest hauntfest ""Insidious Chapter 2"" were back with the possession-afflicted Lambert family -- nervous mom Renai (Rose Byrne) and astral-projecting dad Josh (Patrick Wilson) -- trying to regroup from the spirit realm trauma that almost took their son Dalton.But theres still the unresolved matter of what happened to supernatural whisperer Elise (Lin Shaye) at the end of the first film and that decamping to Joshs childhood Victorian home -- filmed from the trademark Bates House low angle of maximum ominousness -- might not be such a good idea. Also why is Daddy suddenly acting so strange? Wan and co-writer Leigh Whannell (also back as one half of the comic-relief ghost-hunting duo) confidently line up their ducks in a row for more of the same half-shocks fraught wanderings horror-repurposed items (toys piano baby monitor Patrick Wilson) and garish PG-13 apparitions. But after the pleasurable free fall into old-fashioned nightmare artistry that was last summers ""The Conjuring"" this busy-yet-dull sequel feels like Wan robotically flexing his manipulation of fright-film signposts an exercise more silly than sinister.--------------------------- ""Insidious Chapter 2""MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of terror and violence and thematic elements.Running time 1 hour 46 minutes.Playing In general release.

Area theaters. Where do you go after youve visited a shadow dimension where the dead hang out? Thats the conundrum faced in ""Insidious Chapter 2"" which comes upon a few quirky solutions and movie-ripoff scares before settling into a kind of coma. Director James Wan (""The Conjuring"") is a brand name in horror and to his credit adds a gloss on several riffs from ""The Shining"" ""The Exorcist"" and even the unsupernatural ""Psycho."" But ""Insidious 2"" eventually becomes only about whats frightening in those earlier movies -- and relegates its own scares to screechy jump cuts and pop-out-of-the-dark jolts. Patrick Wilson is again Josh Lambert the husband and father whose trip into another realm to retrieve his sons spirit marked the conclusion to 2010s ""Insidious."" Josh and his son Dalton have the ability to ""astral project"" into a place between life and death. Its filled with otherworldly spirits including a ghoul who wants a healthy body to live in. In the previous film the fiend was a frightening old woman; here we learn shes well something else. The reasons for the switch are seen too. But first Joshs wife Renai (Rose Byrne in a thankless role) has to suss out where the new bumps and creaks in the house are coming from. She also wonders whats making Josh act so strange and why their infant baby seems to be a target for evil poltergeist. Rose Byrne in Insidious Chapter 2 Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell build a convoluted mousetrap and occasionally it works. One big reveal in the third act is a time-trippy house-of-mirrors moment that stands as the only real payoff in the film. The rest of the time ""Insidious 2"" bumps into narrative walls. The introduction of a new villain is a blatant attempt at a Freddy Krueger-style franchise fiend. A pair of goofy ghostbusters (Angus Sampson Andrew Astor) return from the first film to lighten the mood but get in the way. Theres also the reprise of the irritating Lin Shaye as a minor medium along with a few other characters. Theres a loophole apparently to who must stay and who can wander back to the living. As for the living if any moviegoers end up wandering out of the theater during the dull derivative parts of ""Insidious 2"" they wont miss much.

"Insidious 2 review same old scares | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesInsidious 2 review same old scaresHorrormeister James Wan doesnt mess with success extending the story from Insidious into the next chapter with the same cast and the same scares.Ty Simpkins as young Dalton Lambert is besieged by ghouls in Insidious Chapter 2.  (MATT KENNEDY PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Sept. 12 2013Insidious Chapter 2Starring Patrick Wilson Rose Byrne Barbara Hershey. Directed by James Wan. 105 minutes. 14A.""Is there something wrong with Daddy?"" asks an anxious Dalton of his even more worried mother.Quick answer yes. Article Continued BelowAfter battling successfully in Insidious to bring Dalton back from the dark netherworld where unhappy spirits reside known as The Further Daddy a.k.a. Josh Lambert is in desperate need of a periodontist (his teeth keep falling out) a dermatologist (for his suddenly flaky skin) and very possibly an exorcist.Insidious Chapter 2 picks up where the first one left off the day after the night before when Josh (played by Patrick Wilson) possessed of an evil spirit strangles the grandmotherly medium Elise.Josh remembers nothing and the police are on the case. But its pretty clear that earthly authorities are going to be of little use to the troubled Lambert family.To the list of other films from which horrormeister James Wan derives his inspiration for the second Insidious instalment add The Shining (1980) sans the snowbound inn.This time a new medium has been brought in by Joshs mom Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) this one armed with a set of what look like Boggle dice. Nerdy ghost busters Specs and Tucker are back and so is Elise (Lin Shaye) who seems to bear no ill will for her rather brutal departure from the first film.Having found a successful formula in the original -- which made almost 100 million worldwide -- Wan sticks with the maxim of ""if it aint broke dont fix it"" right down to the shimmering opening credits the ominous score and the sudden scares.The plot barely matters; theres a new mystery to unravel who is bedevilling Josh and his family? This time while the evil spectre may have questionable parenting skills at least she isnt a silly Darth Maul look-alike. The performances are also pretty much on par with the first with Rose Byrne as Joshs wife Renai even more anxious to protect her children and the always watchable Hershey getting an expanded role. Wilson gets to extend his range a little further from the skeptical dad in part 1 to a Jekyll-and-Hyde wannabe. And dead or alive Lin Shayes Elise as the ghost medium is awfully good.If there is a fundamental flaw in Chapter 2 its that it will make absolutely no sense unless youve seen the first one. Those who enjoyed the first will find the second chapter perfectly serviceable and to Wans credit hes capable of generating plenty of chills without resorting to gore. Fans will be pleased to learn Wans clearly not finished with the Insidious franchise with yet another cliffhanger ending much like the original this time with a new family set to be put through the paranormal wringer.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Picking up exactly where the original left off Chapter 2 simply moves Josh (Patrick Wilson) Renai (Rose Byrne) and their kids to Joshs mothers house where the ghostly apparitions spooky baby monitor sounds deafening noises and laughable nonsense start all over again. Josh has returned from demonic parallel realm The Further but has he inadvertently brought something evil back with him? Frankly who gives a toss? Wans cattle-prod shocks will have you jumping - but his box of tricks is running low. Prattling ghost hunters Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Simpson) are mildly less infuriating than last time but the male medium who uses lettered dice to contact the spirits has inherited their idiot mantle. For all but the most forgiving horror fans this is a lazy stupid and incoherent failure.

He should be fired from this job and sent back to pre-school.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 29 2013Tari EguruzeFeaturedI was pleasantly surprised to find that the Prince Charles Cinema (voted Londons best cinema for good reason) was holding a surprise FREE double bill screening of Insidious and an advanced screening of Insidious Chapter 2 (not expected to be released until September 13 in the UK). The cinema safely hidden between China Town and Leicester Square had announced on Facebook just two days earlier that they had free tickets to give away from the eOne Film Studio. The tickets were offered on a strict first-come-first-serve basis to the first 100 customers who lined up for the 1815 showing on Wednesday 28. The folks at Prince Charles Cinema were also kind enough to add the extra incentive of free drinks and popcorn to whoever attended the showings. Sounds like a great idea initially but it hurt the overall experience for some. As someone already pointed out on Twitter. There were free popcorn packets on every seat which you could hear every viewer taking advantage of throughout both film showings. In addition to the usual crisp packets and fizzy drinks being opened. I also just happened to be sitting behind perhaps the most drunk viewer in the screenings who also just happened to laugh the loudest at all the wrong moments giving the rest of the audience the confidence to laugh along to both films for the next 3 to 4 hours. He was essentially the class clown of the group encouraging everyone to laugh along with him. This was my first experience of the Insidious films by director James Wan of the Saw franchise which I greatly enjoyed. Honestly Im glad the films were screened for free though as I couldnt connect with the films as much as I hoped I would. I would like to say it was largely due to the sounds of the audience taking me out of the film but the films themselves were not very engaging. Insidious (2010) starring Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne is a Haunted House Horror film which focuses on a son of the starring couple falling into a 3 month coma which they find is caused by supernatural nefarious influence. A common tool horror movies usually employ is using the sounds and lack thereof to scare the audience and make them jump but it wasnt used very effectively this time around either. However I did like that the films took the haunted house sub-genre a step further than other films like Paranormal Activity franchise actually delving into the spirit world and having us follow our pov characters there too. Although I felt the film did suffer from a low budget. The spirit world called The Further in the films wasnt visually appealing at all. Perhaps sensing that the fear aspect of the films was lacking there was no shortage of genuinely comedic characters and scenes implemented into the main storyline. For the most part in the form of comedy duo Tucker and Specs (portrayed by Angus Sampson and James Wan veteran Leigh Whannel). The duo were legitimately good in their roles injecting much needed comedy into scenes which would otherwise be uncomfortably or awkwardly un-horrific or fearful as well as greatly amping up the action tension or desperation of the situation at the very least. Honestly Im not sure if Insidious warranted a sequel in the first place and considering how Chapter 2 ended Im sure there will be a third instalment in the near future too. I wouldnt personally recommend the film but It would be an enjoyable watch especially if you had legal and appropriate access to alcohol like we were offered.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/insidious-2,200,insidiouschapter226,insidiouschapter2,timeout
