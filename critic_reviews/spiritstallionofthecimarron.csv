Animation styles old and new converge with mixed results in ""Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron."" This story of the Old West from a horses point of view sports a noble ""my spirit will never be broken"" central theme as well as a fashionably p.c. pro-horse-and-Indian anti-white settler political bent backed up by a host of soaring Bryan Adams vocals. Saddled with a sentimentally ""sincere"" subject and lacking the stylistic and humorous cachet of the recent computer-animated smashes this handsome widescreen production presents the DreamWorks marketing department with a tall order attracting a sizeable public beyond the obvious target audience of pre-teen girls. What ""Spirit"" does possess that most other recent animated films do not is a strong dose of emotion based on genuine peril. There are moments that will upset some of the small fry but the upside is that this odyssey of a beautiful horse going through the rigors of life creates a dramatic pull that will grab many youthful viewers more accustomed to simple prankish humor and jeopardy that can magically be solved by superheroes. Synthesizing elements of traditional painterly animation and 3-D computer work to an unprecedented degree this joint directorial debut by the story supervisors of DreamWorks ""The Prince of Egypt"" Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook majestically intros the unsullied grandeur of the American West as it follows an eagle soaring over what looks like a combination of Goosenecks Monument Valley and Lake Powell. Backdrops in general are more detailed than are found in most old school animation -- they often resemble painted cycloramas -- but dont approach the quasi-photographic sharpness of some computer work. Narrator -- and title character -- is a mustang that grows up to be so fast and headstrong that it likes to race the eagle that every so often flies into the picture as a reminder of unencumbered freedom. Encountering humans for the first time at a forest campsite Spirit is roped after a wild chase and taken to an army fort where the harsh colonel in command determines to break him. Pic effectively gets away with jettisoning any animal dialogue through the heavy use of music sparing doses of narration and interequine communication achieved through looks gestures and whinnies. By these means the horses warn each other about impending danger and even more pointedly celebrate when for example Spirit humiliates the soldiers who presume to try to break him in the fort corral. At the fort Spirit establishes an initial bond with another captive an Indian named Little Creek. After they escape Spirit has every intention of returning to his herd until he meets Little Creeks horse Rain a pretty pinto with a feather in her mane. A romantic romp leaves Spirit feeling the lure of domesticity for the first time but then the cavalry intrudes again leading to a suspenseful and traumatic episode straight out of a silent movie that throws Spirit and Rain into some raging rapids that carry them toward a giant waterfall. A period of separation and enslavement follows; its message consistent with the four-footed p.o.v. and absolute purity of nature ideal is resolutely anti-development of the West. Celebratory music-driven ending will cheer up any moppets shaken by prior events but from an adult perspective wrap-up feels overly simplistic. Although the straight-line script by John Fusco (""Young Guns"") offers few surprises and no irony or playfulness to leaven its grade-school notions about history and the environment the actual experience of watching the picture is mostly pleasurable thanks to the nicely paced sweep of events the grandly rendered settings the emotional appeal of freedom vs. constraint and the degree to which Adams songs and Hans Zimmers music amplify the tales impact. Theres nothing thrilling or new about the work here but accomplished it is. Spirit himself is an engaging hero certainly a leader and role model among horses. Rain is cute in a demure sort of way. With Matt Damon handling most of the vocal chores through Spirits philosophical musings dialogue by human characters is kept to a minimum although accents in general are jarringly modern American rather than old Western.

The sky was an almost-painful blue and the scents were of hay and pumpkins and the death of summer. So Ill admit I was predisposed to enjoy any movie with Cimarron in the title especially a carefully wrought animation of the mesas and river valleys of the Southwest. ""Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron"" didnt just evoke happy memories of that camping trip -- it also joined my list of animated films that parents can indulge alongside their children. ""Spirit"" is smarter than your average cartoon because it doesnt try to joke around with a host of annoying talking animals. There are long stretches where no voices occur -- the main character of Spirit acts as a wild horse would act with only occasional and discreet narration from Matt Damon providing some of the stallions thoughts. Spirit is born to a herd of wild mustangs grows into the new leader and then is captured by American cavalry soldiers pushing to ""settle"" the West. But Spirit wont be broken in the traditional ways and the moviemakers provide an interesting parallel plot with an American Indian tribe that may want to build a different kind of relationship with Spirit. These scenes are rendered with great landscape beauty and a cultural touch that avoids the ridiculous melodramas of ""Pocahontas."" If Spirits bold reckless physicality doesnt keep the interest of the girls in your family theres a potential equestrianlove interest with a she-horse named ""Rain.""

USATODAY.com - In Spirit a mustang sallies forth Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 05/24/2002 - Updated 0235 AM ET In Spirit a mustang sallies forth By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron (out of four) Voices Matt Damon James Cromwell Daniel Studi Directors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook Distributor DreamWorks Rating G Opens Friday nationwide In Spirit horses are the stars of the show but they dont converse like other cartoon animals. They just snort and whinny at each other. Still its more eloquent than anything George Lucas came up with in Attack of the Clones. The filmmakers were on target when they decided that a talking horse would seem silly. Spirit is a poetic and lovely tale told as a silent picture with music and narration about a mustang living an idyllic existence in the prairies of the Old West. But progress introduces Spirit to humans bent on controlling him and breaking his spirit. Read more below Video Trailer for Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron Spirit is aided in his efforts to stay free by a friendly Lakota brave. Spirit also falls for Rain a blue-eyed mare with a feather in her mane; a montage of horsy romance reminiscent of sappy human love scenes plays to music. Sure its corny but the movie is so earnest that audiences are likely to refrain from snickering. Or at least try. Narrator Matt Damon is the capable voice of Spirit reflecting upon his adventures and the voice-over strikes the right blend of reticence and loquaciousness. The boyish voice and simple lyrics of singer Bryan Adams musically illustrate Spirits emotions. The rest is accomplished by the animators Spirits majestic Western scenery resembles Remington landscapes. No matter that the backdrops are an amalgam of landmarks; the Lakota village where Spirit frolics with Rain is a blend of Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks. The painterly style of animation (both hand-drawn and on computer) works beautifully. Spirit gallops up mountainsides leaps over gorges and narrowly escapes soldiers seeking to tame him. Some of the chase scenes are among the most exciting sequences in recent animated films. Still the most significant achievement is fashioning a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats.

Photo Courtesy DreamWorks Pictures (HANDOUT PHOTO) Courage Spirit makes a bold leap for freedom in DreamWorks Pictures traditionally animated feature SPIRIT STALLION OF THE CIMARRON. Photo Courtesy DreamWorks Pictures (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Spirits uneven kick / Voice-over narration Bryan Adams songs mar Wild West tale 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SPIRIT STALLION OF THE CIMARRON Animation. Starring (the voices of) Matt Damon James Cromwell and Bryan Adams. Directed by Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook. (G. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The makers of ""Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron"" had a great idea but they screwed it up. The great idea was to do an animated movie about horses in which the horses dont speak English but communicate in horse sounds. No cute talking-animals stuff -- this was to be a serious picture the story of the Wild West as seen through the eyes of a mustang. But the concept was immediately compromised by the insertion of voice-over narration spoken by Matt Damon from the standpoint of -- guess who? -- the horse. To make matters worse several Bryan Adams songs were added that in a plaintive and unhorselike way speak to the animals thoughts at critical moments. (""Here I am"" Adams sings as Spirit is born.) The result is a mishmash that is sometimes moving sometimes absurd and most of the time just oddly off balance. The animation is also hit-and-miss. ""Spirit"" is excellent at duplicating kinetic camera movement. For example the opening sequence of a herd of horses galloping over the American plains of 125 years ago is presented as if shot from a crane in one unbroken take. Its exhilarating. Throughout the film the horses leg movements are rendered authentically and the scenic backgrounds -- the lavender sunsets the stars at night -- have a hyper-real intensity. Yet the drawing of the horses and the humans lacks the sort of detail weve come to expect. The faces and bodies are somewhat blocky and undefined. In its look ""Spirit"" is less like modern animations such as ""Shrek"" and more like early Disney efforts such as ""Snow White."" ESCAPING THE ARMY ""Spirit"" tells the story of a horse who becomes leader of his happy herd. Everything is swell until one day he is roped into service in the U.S. Army. But the spirit of Spirit cant be broken and in case we have any doubt we hear Adams singing ""If you think you can take me on you must be crazy."" Soon Spirit makes friends with a young Indian named Little Creek and the two escape to have other adventures. ""Spirit"" like the recent ""Ice Age"" is an animation that celebrates creatures on the wrong side of history. ""Ice Age"" had a peculiar environmentalist message that sympathized with every form of extinct animal and presented the coming of mankind as a calamity. In a similar vein ""Spirit"" presents a horse hero who sides with the Indians against the U.S. government and single-handedly tries to stop the laying of the transcontinental railroad. MAGNIFICENT CREATURE IN SERVITUDE It would take a stone heart not to sympathize with the longing of a magnificent creature locked into a life of rigorous servitude. And the scenes of Spirit running free chasing after an eagle who seems to be his friend have a simple beauty. Still we could do without hearing Adams singing ""If you cant catch a wave youre never gonna ride it"" -- that is unless Spirit is a surfer. Likewise when Spirit spends the night looking after an injured loved one hearing Damon telling us how he prayed all night for her to get better only destroys our awe at an animals mute instinctive concern. Yet there is one anthropomorphic touch that does work if only in a funny way. Spirit a tough guy who does a lot of snarling looks a little like Sylvester Stallone which is appropriate since ""stallone"" means stallion in Italian. Its also worth noting that with all the grunting and snorting he does Spirit rivals the actors facility with dialogue.

Spirit a solemn neo-""Bambi"" has been made with simple elegant conviction. The filmmakers have figured out how to give traditional ""2-D"" animation the visual dynamism of CGI. None of this would matter though if the tale didnt draw us into its born-to-roam-free spell. Spirit captured by Union soldiers fights to stay a beautiful unbroken beast and there is scarcely a kid in the audience who wont relate to his quest.
