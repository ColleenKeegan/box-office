"Review Frost/Nixon makes for fine viewing - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Frost/Nixon makes for fine viewingStory Highlights ""Frost/Nixon"" features great performances by Frank Langella Michael Sheen Film is dramatization of David Frosts 1977 interviews with ex-President Nixon Though movie is sometimes glib acting raises it to a high level Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- A series of 30-year-old television interviews doesnt sound like promising movie material. Frank Langella gives ""a heavyweight performance"" as Richard Nixon says Tom Charity. Whats more those who have watched all 20-plus hours of the David Frost-Richard Nixon conversations which form the center of ""Frost/Nixon"" recently report that theyre overwhelmingly dry and dull with the ex-president ably stonewalling questions that were not to his liking and indulging in elaborate self-justification on those that were. Of course thats not what we remember. On the last day of 12 interview sessions as had been agreed British journalist Frost finally broached Watergate. This was always going to be the make-or-break moment. And to everyones astonishment it was Nixon who broke. Those fascinatingly unexpurgated five minutes of presidential floundering in the spring of 1977 weighed more than all the hours of explication that preceded them. At last Tricky Dick admitted misdeeds -- not illegality as such because he claimed the president cannot break the law. That exchange made Frosts reputation and sealed Nixons public ignominy. (Some would argue that today such a sentiment is official government policy.) Can you build a movie on five revelatory minutes? If youre Peter Morgan the answer is yes. The British playwright and screenwriter has a thing about mismatched power couples the relationships between Tony Blair and Elizabeth II in ""The Queen""; a young Scottish medic and Ugandan President Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland""; and between Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" to name just his most recent credits. Morgan seems both awed and appalled by these power-mongers locked in the solitary confinement that political leadership entails -- though his instinct is always to bring them down to earth to find some common ground however fleeting it may be. Interviews often are described as a courtship or seduction but this one was more of a cross-examination. ""A duel"" Nixon calls it. In a sense its the trial he never faced. The entire country would be his jury. Much of the movie is designed to show us how the self-appointed prosecutor was ill-equipped for the task at hand a playboy British comedian-turned-TV chat show host Down Under more accustomed to trading quips with the Bee Gees than grilling presidents. Frost was a lightweight -- thats one of the reasons Nixon and his people agreed to the interview. (There were 600000 more -- a landmark in checkbook journalism that director Ron Howard doesnt lose much sleep over.) Neither actor goes for a full-on impersonation. Michael Sheen -- Tony Blair in ""The Queen"" -- actually dials down Frosts distinctive nasal drone but suggests how this congenial suck-up coasted on his blow-dried charm rakish sideburns and unrealistic self-confidence. Frost may be out of his depth but hes not about to let it cramp his style; hes delighted when the ex-president admires his slip-on Italian shoes. As Nixon Frank Langella (like Sheen a holdover from the award-winning Broadway production) is suitably hunched and guttural but more patrician and less jowly than the real McCoy. Even so its a heavyweight performance. This Nixon is full of pride and fury cerebral and rigorous but fatally hungry for exoneration or failing that (though he never quite admits it) forgiveness. Brash and brazen in comparison with ""The Queen"" Morgans script doesnt stop explaining itself and talking itself up though what it all boils down to is rather less than meets the eye. At one point a drunken wake-up call from Nixon finally kicks Frost into doing some hard journalism but this a figment of the screenwriters overly tidy creative imagination. iReport.com Share reviews of Frost/Nixon But Morgan is rock solid when it comes to structure. Its a compelling account shrewdly bolstered with lively actors in both corners of the ring Sam Rockwell Matthew Macfadyen Rebecca Hall and Oliver Platt in Frosts camp; Toby Jones and Kevin Bacon attending to the president. Jones steals his every scene as the bald germophobe and legendary agent Swifty Lazar a neat counterpoint to his turn as Karl Rove in ""W."" ""Frost/Nixon"" doesnt have much to say about the disgraced president that Oliver Stone for one hasnt already explored in more depth but by the last taping in its glib and reductionist way it works like a charm. Or better yet like television. Which finally is a compliment. ""Frost/Nixon"" runs 122 minutes and is rated R. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

"FOXNews.com - Review `Frost/Nixon depicts tense TV showdown - Celebrity Gossip | Entertainment News | Arts And Entertainment Review `Frost/Nixon depicts tense TV showdown Wednesday December 03 2008 By CHRISTY LEMIRE AP Movie Critic ADVERTISEMENT ""No holds barred"" Richard Nixon urges to David Frost as the two prepare to sit down for a series of interviews in 1977.As ""Frost/Nixon"" powerfully reveals that statement contains equal parts promise and threat from both the disgraced figure on screen and the actor playing him.Frank Langella is positively formidable as the former president a skilled manipulator under optimal circumstances whose desperate desire for rehabilitation makes him extra dangerous.Langella isnt doing a dead-on impression which is preferable; Nixons quirks have been imitated so frequently and poorly such an approach risks lapsing into caricature. Rather he has internalized a volatile combination of inferiority awkwardness quick wit and a hunger for power. He loses himself in the role with rumbles and growls with a hunched carriage and the slightest lift of the eyebrows.Langella and Michael Sheen also excellent as the breezy British TV personality Frost reprise the parts they originated in Peter Morgans Tony Award-winning stage production. But you never feel like youre watching a play on film The way Morgan has opened up the proceedings in his screenplay feels organic under the direction of Ron Howard whos crafted his finest film yet and one of the years best.""Frost/Nixon"" is talky and weighty as it digs into the details of Vietnam and Watergate but it moves along with a fluidity that keeps it constantly engaging. Morgans script also contains a healthy amount of dark humor mostly the result of something crass or inappropriate Nixon has said. Good thing too because the tension starts percolating early and only grows.Upon seeing the image of Nixon smiling eerily as he boards a helicopter after resigning the presidency Frost stands in front of a television transfixed. Hoping to lose the perception that hes a lightweight and gain some credibility _ or rather achieve fame in America _ he approaches Nixon for an interview and promises money he doesnt have.Sheen is doing something so subtle here and as in his insightful work as Tony Blair in Morgans ""The Queen"" hes likely to get upstaged unfortunately. All his Frost wants is to be liked but he strives for that with the slightest obsequiousness. Critics may mistake his playboy demeanor for arrogance but it truly seems to spring from longing.The former president meanwhile hopes to use the opportunity to return to public life among the East Coast elite Hes bored with retirement and feels humiliated droning on for banquet crowds for cash. He wants an interviewer with heft but hell take the 600000 his agent Swifty Lazar (Toby Jones) has secured by saying yes to Frost.And so they face each other for four extended interviews which comprise the films second hour. Frost has gotten help cramming for this exam from British TV producer John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen) veteran journalist Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and author and Nixon critic James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell). Rebecca Hall provides moral support as the sultry socialite Frost picked up in first class while flying to the United States.In Nixons corner are loyalists including the fierce strategist Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) and amusingly a young Diane Sawyer. Performances from the chief supporting players are uniformly excellent especially from Platt and Rockwell whose characters rib each other and share a disdain of Frosts celebrity.But Zelnick puts it best when he calls Frost ""the most unlikely white knight ... but a man who had one big advantage over all of us. He understood television."" And television exposed both Frost and Nixon for their true natures _ for better and for worse.""Frost/Nixon"" a Universal Pictures release is rated R for some language.

"Frost/Nixon | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Frost/Nixon Print Page Email Page Search Frost/Nixon (2008; Rated ) A- "" Oscar for Langella?"" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Frost/Nixon(2008; R)In theaters Friday 5 December 2008 Summary A dramatic retelling of the post-Watergate television interviews between British talk-show host David Frost and former president Richard Nixon. Genre Drama HistoricalDirector Ron HowardCast Frank Langella Michael Sheen At the ends of their respective terms Richard Nixon and George W. Bush were the two least popular presidents in the last half-century--but Nixon is an infinitely more complex and fascinating figure. Maybe thats why ""Frost/Nixon"" a film about just one post-presidential slice of Nixons life somehow resonates more deeply than Oliver Stones ""W."" which tried to take the full measure of the man. ""Frost/Nixon"" is one of Ron Howards simplest films and also one of his best. Led by an Oscar-level performance by Frank Langella and fine work from Michael Sheen as the dapper playboy interviewer David Frost this adaptation of Peter Morgans play is one of the best movies of the year. Whether youre old enough to remember the Frost/Nixon interviews from 1977 or smart enough (and that would be just about everyone) to recognize the parallels between authority-abusing presidents some 40 years apart every frame of this film is relevant today. A number of fine actors have played Richard Nixon. Michael Gambon Philip Baker Hall Dan Hedaya Anthony Hopkins. Some have delved into sweaty paranoid caricatures. Frank Langellas Nixon is not an impersonation though Langella does capture Nixons deep voice and hunched uncomfortableness. He doesnt really look like Nixon but he delivers the mans essence--the arrogance the social awkwardness the narcissism. It is a marvelous piece of acting. Before we get to Nixon and the interviews we have to know the story of David Frost the charming lightweight whose career was in a downswing by the mid-1970s. Following a successful run of TV gigs in Britain Frost was doing a chat show in Australia when he came up with the idea of an extended sit-down session with Nixon. After several failed attempts to raise the money Frost put up much of Nixons 600000 fee himself and the game was on. Much to the dismay of his advisers (Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell) Frost lands nary a punch in the early rounds with Nixon who is a master at evading questions dominating the conversation and messing with Frost. (Just before one session Nixon says ""So...did you do any fornicating last night?"" You believe he might be the one man on the planet who would actually use that term.) Yet even as Nixon is batting Frost around between his paws you feel that Nixon also envies this dapper womanizer. Frost is the kind of guy Nixon probably hated as a younger man--the guy who gets the pretty girls tells the funny jokes and isnt burdened by the weight of the worlds problems. ""Frost/Nixon"" plays a little with the timeline of the interviews and includes some fully fictionalized moments including a pivotal late-night phone conversation between Nixon and Frost that never took place. Thats OK; this isnt a documentary. Morgans screen adaptation of his own play achieves a truth about these two men and their utterly unlikely encounter on the world stage. Howard knows he has strong material and a stellar band of actors so he doesnt try to do too much with the camera. He places in the mid-1970s without hitting us over the head with period-piece reminders he gives us the back story--and then he lets Langella and Michael Sheen have at it. The result is one of the fastest and most entertaining two-hour films of the year.

The outcome isnt half as conflicted as you might imagine though its hard to argue that Howard brings anything new to Morgans play. Perhaps his biggest achievement is to preserve the fine performances of Michael Sheen and Frank Langella who both starred in the original London theatre production.What the director of Apollo 13 and Cinderella Man does find in Morgans typically bold and witty script is an energetic sports movie with an underdog Frost who flounders for three quarters before triumphing in the fourth along the way indulging in sweaty close-ups ample pep talks and an extended training period. The assumption is that we know all about Nixon (and if we dont the film isnt telling) played more endearingly by Langella than by Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stones 1995 biopic. This means that the pre-match focus is mostly reserved for Sheens Frost and his three-man team of two researchers and a producer who act as foils to their bosss strengths and failings. Its not Sheens best performance but hes likeable nonetheless and his wayward charm along with Langellas increasing vulnerability as Nixon goes some way to carrying the movie. Sheens Frost is a very English playboy with one eye on the prize and another on the ladies allowing for the entry of Rebecca Hall as Frosts sideshow love interest. Shes underwritten for sure but theres period pleasure to be won from a mid-Atlantic seduction scene during which like most of the film theres much to enjoy but little to learn.

Not forgetting that Howard made a boxing film Cinderella Man this goes the distance of punches (to reputation) and jabs(to esteem) with the possibility of only one coming out a winner taking into account the feints parries time-wasting and cover-ups. We get a lot of tension built up pre-fight by concentrating on the Frost camp with two researchers and a producer and no network willing to put it on or being criminally underfunded. As a play-boy talk show host whose best years are behind him we concentrate on his girlfriend his show-biz energy and charm and how he is putting everything on this last roll of the dice to boost his career.Langhella plays Nixon as a human being who is vulnerable and impressed by FrostaEUR(tm)s Italian shoes his parties and his girlfriend. Nixon is seen to win the early rounds of the interview with his aide Kevin Bacon willing to step in at any perceived underhand ploy by Frost to make his man divulge. The fact that Frost has access to unpublished interviews between Coulson and Nixon which he quotes from and he is the recipient of a late-night drunken phone call from Nixon just gives him the edge to make the knockout blow and to force the confession he abused his position as President to authorise the break-ins and pay for the cover-up. Just as the tapes cost Nixon the Presidency and proved his role in the Watergate scandal due to the admission of the man Butterfield who knew of them(one of three) so the Frost-Nixon interview got to Nixon in a way that no journalist  trial or impeachment could do. The little man whose lack of social graces and his vanity made him seek the highest office in the land and once there to seek total control through the tapes would prove his undoing.

Comments click to enlarge Frost/Nixon Rated R  2008 Peter Morgans hit play about the 1977 TV interviews between David Frost and Richard Nixon makes for a punchy political entertainment anchored by Frank Langellas grand mercurial performance as the angry ex-president. Frost relinquished any editorial control when he granted Morgan the rights to his story and the movie is hardly flattering of him it portrays Frost (Michael Sheen) as a glib entertainer unprepared for Nixons mind games and masterly obfuscations. But in contrast to the standard legend--that Frost became a real reporter doing his homework and nailing Nixon on Watergate--Morgan has the temerity to suggest that Frost triumphed not in spite of his showmanship but because of it. Ron Howard directed with outstanding support from Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan Nixons fierce chief of staff and Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell as Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. Frosts dogged researchers.

As ""Frost/Nixon"" begins things have changed for British talk-show host David Frost (Michael Sheen) -- and not for the better.Once the toast of New York his show there has been canceled and hes retreated to Sydney Australia and to London. Not exactly small towns but small comfort for a man whos unwilling to let go of his dream success in America.Eager for another chance Frost pursues an interview with President Richard M. Nixon (Frank Langella) who has been forced to resign from office because of the Watergate scandal. Despite warnings not to mess with ""Tricky Dick"" Frost considers it good news when the disgraced politician agrees to sit down for the cameras. The bad news is that Nixons participation has a price tag 600000.Not only is Frost financially strapped but his research team is skeptical that he can deliver what America wants to hear an apology from Nixon for breaking the law.Based on the hit play ""Frost/Nixon"" is as thrilling as it is provocative. Working from a script by Peter Morgan who also wrote the stage version director Ron Howard (""A Beautiful Mind"") delivers a smart David vs. Goliath tale with unmistakable relevance to contemporary American politics. Plays often lose their energy when adapted for the screen. But even on the stage ""Frost/Nixon"" had a cinematic dynamism and Howard has only enhanced that quality.Reprising their stage roles Langella and Sheen complement each other perfectly. Langella gives us a Nixon who is indeed a crook but also tragically insecure. Sheen (who played Tony Blair in ""The Queen"") portrays Frost as a man whos so in love with the spotlight that he doesnt mind being on a tightrope. Also turning in inspired performances are Sam Rockwell as journalist James Reston Jr. and Kevin Bacon as Nixons aide Jack Brennan.""Frost/Nixon"" is one of the years best films.calvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com -- 314-340-8346R -- 202 -- Contains profanity Tags Nixon  Calvin Wilson View (...) comments Most popular Old Standard Fried Chicken will close this weekend Smash-and-grab burglars hit original Sweetie Pies location in Dellwood Mellow Mushroom pizzeria opens in Sunset Hills Half-century-old Webster Groves Bookshop is closing Today in Pokemon Go Shootout in Vegas security risk in Israel finding Yuri in Russia Latest Disney movies help autistic boy find his voice in Life Animated Woody Allens Cafe Society is a bittersweet treat A trio of misfit mothers lose control in Bad Moms Jason Bourne is back doing what he does best Eat That Question taps into Frank Zappa Quick links Comics/games Movie times Pop off forum Reel Time movie forum TV listings The Blender Tube Talk Sign up For Go Sneak Peek Pick up this Sundays paper for the Craft Beer Special Section Get your tickets for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch Arts + Craft Brewfest See ads from todays newspaper Manage your services Feast Magazine Ladue News St. Louis Best Bridal STL High School Sports Products and features Apps Archives Calendar Chats Comics amp; games Contests E-edition Forums Newsletters Our events Press releases Tools and services Advertise with us Autos Classifieds Contact us Homes Jobs Newspapers in Education Page reprints Post-Dispatch store Site help Subscriber services (c) Copyright 2016 STLtoday.com 900 N.

"Frost/Nixon classy canny - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Frost/Nixon classy cannyPeter Morgans compelling stage piece plays like a thriller in Ron Howards hands.December 05 2008|KENNETH TURAN | MOVIE CRITIC Ron Howard is celebrating his 50th year in show business and if you learn anything in that span its not to mess with a good thing. In ""Frost/Nixon"" the veteran director smoothly demonstrates the value of that attitude taking a silk purse of a project making it even silkier and producing perhaps the best work of his career in the process.The silk purse in question is a play with a considerable pedigree. Written by Peter Morgan best known for the Helen Mirren-starring ""The Queen"" ""Frost/Nixon"" had highly successful runs in both London and New York and won the best actor Tony for Frank Langella in the process.Despite this success ""Frost/Nixon"" was not an easy sell in todays adult-phobic film marketplace even with an Oscar-winning director attached. The production reportedly had one of the tightest budgets and shortest shooting schedules in Howards last 30 years as a director and everyone including Howard took reduced or deferred fees.One of the explanations for all this caution is that a film looking behind the scenes at the television interviews that British TV personality David Frost did with former President Richard Nixon in 1977 doesnt sound all that dramatic now does it?""Frost/Nixon"" however turns out to be formidably involving and the reasons start not with expert costars Langella and Michael Sheen or their strong supporting cast or even the skills of Howard but with the gifts and vision of Morgan who wrote the screenplay as well as the play.Credited with not only ""The Queen"" and its prequel ""The Deal"" but also ""The Last King of Scotland"" Morgan has been especially adept at exploring what he calls ""the twilight between historical fact and fiction"" a point he emphasizes in an authors note to the dramas printed edition. ""It is a play not a historical document"" he writes ""and I have on occasion perhaps inevitably been unable to resist using my imagination.""Morgan has conjured up what he described when talking the project up to Frost himself as ""a sort of intellectual Rocky "" a battle of wits between two of the more unlikely antagonists the television medium has ever brought together.On one side is Frost (Sheen) a man of imperturbable self-confidence and minimal gravitas who has been referred to by at least one headline writer as ""Frosty the Showman."" A practiced interviewer and talk show host he is only minimally discomforted when girlfriend-to-be Caroline Cushing (the always letter-perfect Rebecca Hall) remembers a description of him as having ""achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.""In the other corner is Frosts polar opposite the least glib man on Earth the tortured Richard Nixon (Langella) a world-class brooder with a Machiavellian mind who is shown in ""Frost/Nixons"" opening sequences resigning the presidency in disgrace and leaving Washington for soothing San Clemente in 1974.What brings these two together three years later is the great equalizers of modern culture fame and money. Frost hungry for American-style success and cognizant of the huge ratings numbers that Nixons resignation earned dangles so much money that both Nixon and his agent Swifty Lazar (Toby Jones) have to take notice.Nixons team led by former Marine Lt. Col. Jack Brennan (a polished Kevin Bacon) also felt Frost would be a lightweight competitor. Helping to stiffen the talk show hosts spine were producer John Birt (""Pride and Prejudices"" Matthew Macfadyen) veteran journalist Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and the zealous James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) who thirsted to ""give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.""The first half of ""Frost/Nixon"" covers the buildup to the interviews including a frantic search for the money to pay the former president and the second is the battle itself. At first as Brennan relates in a fine bit about being in the ring with a champion Frost barely laid a glove on Nixon. But as boxing fans know you have to go the distance before you can be declared the winner.Sheen who portrayed Tony Blair in 2006s ""The Queen"" is excellent but Langella will deservedly get the lions share of good notices for this film. His Nixon is not an impersonation but an exceptional performance a great actors take on an unnerving character that especially in an invented scene of a late-night phone call to Frost rises to remarkable levels of artistry.It also must be emphasized that even though director Howard had all these first-class elements to work with ""Frost/Nixon"" wouldnt have succeeded as well as it does without his experience his professionalism and his skills. Hes successfully opened the play up without pushing anything too hard and hes deftly avoided the sentimentality that with the exception of the underrated ""The Missing"" has often been a quality of his films.The result is involving engrossing cinema -- more thrilling in fact than Howards ""The Da Vinci Code"" -- filmmaking of a type rarely seen anymore and sorely missed.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--Frost/NixonMPAA rating R for some languageRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesPlaying In limited release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/05/entertainment/et-frost5,200,frostnixon6,frostnixon,latimes

Tears glimmer in the ex-Presidents eyes then he closes them to contain the pain as he staggers through his reciting of the conversation. ""I said You know John when I went to bed last night I said I hoped I said I hoped I almost prayed I wouldnt wake up this morning."" He grimaces at the memory of his suicidal depression and winces at what followed his tardy dismissal of his two closest aides Ehrlichman and Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. ""They agreed to leave. And so it was late but I did it. I cut off one arm then cut off the other."" He shakes his head at each ""slash"" and his mouth falls into the famed Nixon frown. Frank Langella would be proud of such a performance. But this display of mood-altering confession and self-justification was the real Nixon in his TV marathon with Frost in 1977 three years after he left the White House in disgrace. That four-part joust still the highest-rated interview show in U.S. history was the inspiration for Peter Morgans London and Broadway play starring Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost. Langella and Sheen (and Morgan) repeat their roles in the Ron Howard movie version opening today. Both the movie and the interviews (now available on DVD as Frost Nixon The Original Watergate Interviews) are essential evocations of a unique moment in American history -- when the only President ever to resign his office sat down for his own TV inquisition. (See pictures of TIMEs Watergate covers.) The stage original was plenty entertaining a portrait of two brilliant conflicted men with something to prove Nixon that he was a statesman not a crook; Frost that he had the gravitas to bring a big man down. So how does that become a movie -- one moreover that is essentially a making-of feature about a 70s TV show? Howard knew that to convey the particulars of what must seem like ancient history to younger viewers he needed to move from the long-shot perspective of a play to the interviews own visual style alternating medium shots of Frost with blistering close-ups of Nixon. Thus what was a pageant on the stage becomes an intimate magnified TV show the camera alert to every nuance of Frosts insecurity rising to bravado Nixons pugnacity gradually sagging into defeat. This very fine movie doesnt make history but it captures history as few others have. (See the Top 10 unfortunate political one-liners.) Morgans script has events push Frost against the ropes the better to show how he rallied to win the fight. In a career slump after losing his Australian TV gig he secures a contract for the Nixon interviews but must pay 200000 out of his own pocket. The three big U.S. networks refuse to buy into his scheme and he borrows money from friends. (He eventually creates a de facto network of independent stations to air the interviews.) Of the two reporters he hires to research Nixon one Bob Zelnick (large puddingy Oliver Platt) is cynical of Frosts ability to bring the scheme off and the other James Reston Jr. (bantam battler Sam Rockwell) rails against the hosts apparent reluctance to focus on studying up. Whereas Frosts seconds are guns for hire Nixons cornerman Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) has as lifetime loyalty to his boss. Since the resignation he has become a fretful coach and father figure to Nixon encouraging him to be strong insisting an interview be stopped at the first sign of Nixons vulnerability. All these plot elements have some basis in fact. Morgans one fanciful addition is a phone call Nixon makes to Frost spilling out his guts fears and resentments. In this scene above all others Langella leeches into the presidents anxieties and summons much of the angry power of the private man -- or at least our image of the private man. But this is an impressive performance throughout. Langella is not a natural Nixon; he has a voluptuarys face and a self-assurance the president only dreamed of. So he burrows into Nixon and comes out with a figure who is less a simulacrum than the definitive interpretation. Still theres nothing like the real thing in festering splendor on the Frost/Nixon DVD. Here is Tricky Dick smiling wheedling lawyering like crazy to get himself exonerated on a technicality until he realizes that this isnt a courtroom its a TV show. Like any politician Nixon was an actor -- a bad actor to be sure but a great bad actor in that he let the cameras surgical close-ups reveal more than he wanted to display and sometimes the exact opposite of what he was trying to say. The performance is infuriating and hilarious or unbearably poignant depending on your politics. Either way its stirring depleting drama. Nixon/Nixon Richard Nixon no less than David Frost was a TV personality. Every U.S. president from John Kennedy on has had to be one the nations talk-show host defining its agenda and character. (Franklin D. Roosevelt created the same niche on radio with his Fireside Chats.) TV stardom is a matter of connecting with the masses by peddling an agreeable personality. Thats a challenge for which the brainy devious Nixon was ill-suited. See pictures of TIMEs Watergate covers. Read TIMEs cover story on the Frost interview.

ABOUT THE MOVIEFrost/Nixon    (out of four)Stars Frank Langella Michael Sheen Sam Rockwell Kevin Bacon Matthew Macfadyen Oliver PlattDirector Ron HowardDistributor Universal PicturesRating R for some languageRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesOpens Friday in select cities WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY A brief understated scene in Frost/Nixon perfectly captures the subtle poignance in an absorbing film replete with telling moments and powerful performances. Its 1977 and disgraced former president Richard Nixon played mesmerizingly by Frank Langella has lost his public swagger. He emerges from the final bout in a series of interviews with British talk-show host David Frost looking beaten down and bewildered. INTERVIEW Langella is perfectly clear Nixon role proves haunting A crowd gathers as he heads for his limousine. Nixon walks up to a woman holding a dachshund and pets the dog tapping it gingerly then tugging clumsily on its ear. With this wordless gesture he conveys a palpable sense of defeat and social awkwardness. One cant help but be moved even after having just watched him admit that he let the country down with the Watergate debacle. ""Im going to have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life"" he tells Frost (a remarkable Michael Sheen). You can almost see the weight of that burden on his sagging shoulders. Langella and Sheen originated these roles in the play by Peter Morgan (who also wrote the screenplay) and translate them to the screen with awe-inspiring deftness. Langellas bravura performance comprises equal parts nuance bluster and presidential stature. Sheen adroitly plays the dapper journalistic lightweight who gains determination and intellectual gravitas. The story works ideally on screen thanks to Ron Howards nimble direction. Frost/Nixon is not a conventional biopic but it effectively evokes the sociocultural milieu of the time and presents a probing character study. It is most like a thriller as Frosts career hinges on getting the interviews and eliciting Nixons on-air apology. Howard establishes a mounting sense of tension interspersing interviews with talking-head-style analyses from each camp. Oliver Platt Matthew Macfadyen and Kevin Bacon are excellent in these roles. Morgan seamlessly blends actual interview dialogue and imagined conversations. The film convincingly conveys how uncomfortable the 37th president was in his own skin. Nixon asks Frost if he likes going to parties. Nixon remarks wistfully ""You have no idea how fortunate that makes you liking people and being liked having that facility that lightness that charm. I dont have it. I never did. It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinges on being liked."" Its hard to imagine how a film built around one-on-one interviews could be entertaining but Frost/Nixon could not be more enthralling.

Starring Frank Langella Michael Sheen Kevin Bacon Sam Rockwell Oliver Platt Rebecca Hall Toby Jones Director Ron Howard Running time 202  Editorial Review Neither the title nor the subject matter prepares you for the pure fun of ""Frost/Nixon."" Ron Howards movie is based on Peter Morgans play which was based on the 1977 television interviews between British journalist David Frost and former president Richard Nixon. You expect something dry historical and probably contrived. But you get a delicious contest of wits brilliant acting and a surprisingly gripping narrative -- no less dramatic even though the results are a foregone conclusion.Frost and Nixon desperately needed each other when they sat for a series of in-depth interviews three years after Nixons resignation. Frost was deemed a lightweight and bet his future career on a blockbuster television special. Nixon wanted rehabilitation and gambled that Frost would lob him softballs.As Nixon Frank Langella is perfection. The character is generated from the inside out not predicated on surface imitation or caricature. Langellas characterization is based on a deeply meditated sense of the man whose craving for power love and legacy leads to a strange mix of malice and charm.Frost is portrayed by Michael Sheen as a shallow playboy with a profound hollowness in his ambitious soul.The writing is so good the acting so powerful that the film goes well beyond the courtroom drama into the territory of the classic history play.It isnt Shakespeare but it is drama at a level one doesnt often get in movies.""Frost/Nixon"" covers a lot of ground from the expansion of the Vietnam War into Cambodia to the minutiae of Watergate. Its not a cradle-to-grave portrayal but hidden in plain sight is an important primer (for a new generation) on all things Nixon. We may debate yet about his service to the country. But he has clearly become an essential figure for a deeper kind of service rattling about in his self-made chains in the depths of the political imagination.-- Philip Kennicott (Dec. 12 2008)Contains strong language.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Despite a cavalcade of talent ""Frost/Nixon"" is a middling thing. It began on the small screen as a series of interviews shifted to Broadway as a drama (by Peter Morgan screenwriter of ""The Queen"") and now reappears as a film by director Ron Howard. It still feels small. The story behind English interviewer David Frosts televised battle of wits with former President Richard Nixon is presented as if it were a tale of enormous political consequence but it passes like a string of so-so anecdotes. Theres more entertainment value in watching Couric/Palin on YouTube. Michael Sheen (Tony Blair in ""The Queen"") plays Frost a glib toothy bon vivant accurately described in the film as being a celebrity despite ""having no particular quality."" He was well known for being well known hosting variety shows in Australia and England but the brass ring of American success eluded him. He never stopped striving however. By the mid-1970s he took his last shot at U.S. fame with an unlikely grandiose project. He approached Nixon disgraced and sidelined from public life following Watergate for a series of wide-ranging interviews. Nixon signed on tempted by an unheard-of 600000 appearance fee and the chance to repair his reputation in a high-profile forum. Success for Frost who personally bankrolled the show required outfoxing Tricky Dick and getting him to finally confess his misdeeds. Its ""Rocky"" for the debate club. But there arent many dramatic body blows. The first hour of the film focuses on the business negotiations behind the shows as if syndication strategies were matters of pulse-pounding excitement. We see the preparation by Team Frost (with Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt as interview researchers personally invested in nailing their opponent) and Team Nixon (with Kevin Bacon as his protective chief of staff). Papers are shuffled documents are underlined brows are furrowed. And then -- nothing. For the first few televised encounters Nixon outmaneuvers Frost offering banal anecdotes about Mao and self-justifying filibusters on Vietnam War policy. Only on the precipice of failure does Frost buckle down do his own homework and finally box in his slippery adversary. Sheen plays Frost as a genial high-living lightweight without much of an inner life. The films emotional heft is provided by Frank Langellas Nixon. He avoids the easy choice of portraying the dishonored ex-commander in chief as a hissable cardboard villain. In fact he goes too far in the opposite direction giving Nixon sympathetic humanizing dimensions the man seemingly never possessed in real life. Langella makes Nixon a Shakespearean creature courtly but not warm calculating yet needy chafing in luxurious exile. Hes imperious but when Frost presses him with clear evidence of his Watergate guilt this fictional Nixon shows expressions of pained remorse that the historical Nixon never displayed. Langella made Dracula fatally seductive when he played that role onscreen and he does the same here. FROST/NIXON  out of 4 stars Rating R for some language. Where Southdale. Other than some brief profanity this Nixon is a swell guy if a rather sad one. The vindictive partisan criminal impulses and thunderbolt anger that brought the real Nixon to ruin are hidden. The TV camera peered into Nixons soul costing him the 1960 election after his debate with John Kennedy and exposing him in the original Frost interviews. As the real Nixon rationalized his actions in 1977 viewers saw a man for whom lying was an instinctual imperative like salmon swimming upstream to spawn before they die. Director Howard may be too nice a guy to comprehend the cruelty that coexisted with Nixons formidable intellect. In effect hes become a co-conspirator in romantic revisionism poor history and weak drama. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) and David Frost (Michael Sheen) exchange pleasantries in Frost/Nixon. Photo McCLATCHY TRIBUNE | UNIVERSAL STUDIOS Frost/Nixon 1 / 1 Back to Gallery As a kid who grew up glued to the set during the Watergate crisis I was mesmerized by the final act of Frost/Nixon. The idea that Richard Milhous Nixon could feel remorse -- and then express it on television -- for the cover-up that brought down his administration was a monumental revelation in 1977 and it remains monumental on reflection now. To watch that instant of national catharsis reenacted onscreen in Ron Howards pensive movie offers for this child of the 70s a major Proustian flashback. Then again the word ""reenacted"" hardly does justice to Frank Langellas surreal transmutation into the 37th President -- a bravura performance that hardly seems like a performance at all. Without a trace of mimicry or artifice without any perceivable attempt to ape Nixons (very ape-able) mannerisms Langella becomes Nixon. For the duration of the film he is Nixon. And when he unloads that whopper of an admission at the close of his legendary interviews with David Frost its Nixon himself coming clean with the greatest political mea culpa of the 20th century. Langella fills his role with such considered human nuance -- in the angle of his shoulders the confusion in his face -- that he builds our sympathy while Frost and his research team are building their case against him. He isnt the devil; he seems if anything a man whose two huge misfortunes were his awkwardness and his gift for delusion. Anthony Hopkins mined both brilliantly in Oliver Stones 1995 biopic but his approach to Nixons tragedy was Shakespearean and large. Langella goes small. And hes all the more powerful for it. Adapted by Peter Morgan from his own stage play Frost/Nixon reunites Langella with Michael Sheen as Frost -- an English talk-show host that no one on either side of the Atlantic expected to succeed. Both originated their roles in London two years ago and reprised them for a brief run on Broadway. Having not seen the work live I cant compare it with Howards final product. But its megazoom enlargement to the big screen means that Frosts enormous smiling face eats half the movie. Theres a reason why Were told he was a performer rather than a journalist a telegenic schmoozing playboy underestimated by members of Nixons camp (look for Kevin Bacon in fine form) and even a few of his own. This characterization is vital to the films David-and-Goliath combat motif and it has its uses. The slingshot is 18-and-a-half minutes on a White House tape. After days of interviewing he finally needled Nixon into confessing that he ""said things that were not true"" and ""let the American people down."" In so doing Frost blazed new trails in syndication and news coverage scoring a global audience in the triumph of his career. Sheen is a terrific actor with a thick layer of charm. Hes also an old pro at going toe-to-toe with giants in Peter Morgan screenplays (see The Queen) and if I must watch someone grin like a popinjay for two hours straight hes my pick. But Howard and Morgan dont give him much to chew on behind that defensive smile; he remains an enigma. The film could dwell more on his inner workings less on fake-o interviews with assorted characters that are meant to add documentarian heft but simply break the spell. If its nonfiction were after we can just watch the legendary shows themselves (on DVD as what else Frost/Nixon). When the movie sticks to its central dramatic conflict it can be spellbinding Nixon makes a rambling confessional phone call to Frost late one night that head-shrinks the both of them and lingers like a dream. The next day is their final confrontation in upholstered yellow chairs a nightmare for Nixon an awakening for everyone else.

Working with Nixon and Frosts very different energies the two actors refit the Janus masks of the theater for what was an American tragedy. Sheens somewhat impish Frost is wont to flash a smile that seems more tight than true more defensive than inviting. For his part Langella depicts the 37th president of the United States as a man who resides behind a glowering mask. His smiles too hint at things other than joy. When he shows his teeth he seems to be well baring them. There is something spare even inherently theatrical in the pitting of these titanic -- but also insecure -- egos. And it begs the question from the viewer What must Peter Morgans work have been like staged? This is probably not the question director Ron Howard hoped to elicit when he and producing partner Brian Grazer journeyed to Londons West End to see the play and secure the rights. ""Frost/Nixon"" is a stylish smart film. The leads grasp of their characters psyches is impressive. And Rebecca Hall (""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") provides a sharp turn as Caroline Cushing Frosts paramour. But one need only watch excerpts of those televised tete-a-tetes to feel something is muted here. (A DVD of the original Watergate portion has recently been released by Liberation Entertainment.) The story reminds viewers of the important role TV has played in molding U.S. history. Frost with a mix of hubris and desperation wrangled a series of interviews with the former president whod resigned Aug. 9 1974. The sit-downs took place over four weeks and covered a variety of topics most famously the Watergate break-in and coverup. They were watched by the largest television audience for a news interview ever reportedly 45 million. Morgan who wrote ""The Queen"" another work about the odd bedfellows power makes says he tried to make ""Frost/Nixon"" adaptation- proof. Here he tries to prove himself wrong by turning it into a screenplay. The results are elegant. Yet they somehow lack the actual faceoffs edge. Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell are Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. The former NPR vet and the college lecturer respectively were brought in to research and prep Frost for the interviews. Like talking-head interviewees in a PBS documentary they and other players in the drama relate details about how the interviews came about. They also provide partisan spins. Jack Brennan Nixons chief of staff after he resigned (played by Kevin Bacon) relates his boss bitter final days. Agent and legend Irving ""Swifty"" Lazar (Toby Jones) boasts about negotiating the outrageous interview fee. Cushing recounts how Frost tried to hustle the Big Three networks while keeping the Nixon signed on. There are some things theater does better than film or at least differently. It can heighten philosophical quandaries. For instance using monitors onstage the play was able to express the tension between the true and the televised. Yes there is news footage of the arrests the Senate hearings CBS newsman Eric Sevareids announcement of Nixons farewell. But Howard isnt entirely concerned with the amazing ascendancy of the medium. In ""Frost/Nixon"" the camera undertakes a different kind of discovery finding its gold in Frosts tics and Nixons stillness. One of the more potent moments in the film comes as Frost watches as Nixons helicopter departs from the White House. The chopper peels away. Then Salvatore Totinos camera pulls away from its close-up of Frost transfixed. It isnt Nixon and Frosts differences that matter. Its their core kinship -- their codependence really -- that Howards film captures. Frost says it best standing in an airport queue with his producer and friend John Birt (Matthew MacFayden). He wants back into the American spotlight he says. Theres nothing quite like it. Losing that coveted spot leaves a sickening emptiness. As the men are seated across from each other once the interviews are underway there is plenty Nixon takes issue with in Frosts view of the world -- and of his crimes against a nation. But this nauseated feeling of a scuttled American dream they most certainly saw eye to eye on.

"Frost/Nixon stars Frank Langella Michael Sheen - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Frost/Nixon stars Frank Langella Michael SheenRating 3 stars (good)December 12 2008|By Michael Phillips Tribune criticFrost/Nixon You dont even need a mental image of Ron Howard to know that ""Frost/Nixon"" was made -- and made well -- by a very nice man. Richard M. Nixon is unlikely ever to get more sympathetic treatment on screen.David Frosts people paid Nixons people 600000 for the disgraced former president to sit for a series of television interviews taped in March and April 1977 not quite three years after Nixon resigned. If checkbook journalism ever had a leg to stand on those interviews were that leg. Watching Frost the louche sleepy-eyed talk show host lock rhetorical horns with his subject -- evasive revealing sentimental icy a tragicomic paradox in action -- made for a riveting postmortem on a fall from power and the fallout from Watergate as told by a classically unreliable narrator and his interrogator.Peter Morgan got a good play out of it. The play is now a film adapted by Morgan. And like ""Doubt"" this weeks other stage-to-screen adaptation director Ron Howards ""Frost/Nixon"" pours old-fashioned theatrical juice into a cinematic bottle and lets the actors drink it up.Well take it in order of billing. Re-creating his London and New York roles Michael Sheen -- who played Tony Blair in ""The Queen"" another deft swift bit of recent history dramatized by Morgan -- has a satirists ear for tweaking his subject gently. The real Frost always looked like hed stayed up all night partying with Henry Kissinger and Jill St. John. Sheen by contrast is a wide-eyed bushy-tailed presence more pup than horn-dog. Still hes very fine. With each picture Sheen puts his theatrical training to better more subtle use.There never was a question of seasoning or scale with Frank Langella so moving in the recent indie ""Starting Out in the Evening."" Like Sheen Langella won accolades in London and on Broadway for ""Frost/Nixon."" His re-creation of the role for director Howard is destined for an Oscar nomination. Even if Langella were lousy hed be nominated. Its that kind of role. (Warren Beatty among others considered playing it.) We love to see famous weasels humanized; its a spectator sport that simultaneously confirms and corrects our worst suspicions about a real-life titan laid low.Langellas interpretation is hard to resist even if some of the choices ignore the historical record. When the real Nixon told Frost about his enemies sticking the knife in for example he did so with a smile as if to defuse the violence of his description. In the movie Langella goes for pure pathos at the same moment. Similarly when Sheens Frost asks Langellas Nixon if he let the American people down the answers preceded by a pause lasting 18 seconds. Wheres Rose Mary Woods when you need her?Does it work though? Hell yes it works. ""Frost/Nixon"" is wholly absorbing. As Frosts colleagues (played by Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell among others) prepare their man for the showdown Nixon and his longtime ally Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) along with Nixons agent Swifty Lazar (droll work from Toby Jones) suss out their opponent. Morgans sense of backstage melodrama is very shrewd. ""Long answers. Control the space. Dont let him in"" Brennan advises Nixon before the taping. The strategy works at first. Then Frost knuckles down after a boozy late-night phone call from Nixon and realizes theres going to be a winner and a loser in all of this.Though the material never goes for the jugular a different sort of director wouldve brought out a sharper edge. References to the ""reductive power of the close-up"" landed in the play differently than they do on screen especially on a screen laden with conventionally framed and slotted close-ups of Langella and Sheen doing battle. Similarly a different director mightve favored a composer other than Hans Zimmer whose hackneyed ""danger"" music over the opening Watergate montage belongs to a different genre -- a dumber one.But as much as Langellas or Sheens show this is Morgans. He is a terrific middlebrow dramatist and one of his strengths along with his wit is his modesty of scale. ""Frost/Nixon"" works best when its simply letting first-rate actors including Rebecca Hall as Frosts lover have at it truth lies and all.- - -MPAA rating R (for some language )Running time 202Opening FridayStarring Frank Langella (Richard M.

Helping him out in the screen version of the play are Sam Rockwell Matthew Macfadyen and Oliver Platt.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted December 12 2008Three years after resigning from office - the only U.S. president to do so - Richard M. Nixon agreed to sit for a long conversation with David Frost an English TV chat-show host whod entertained a few politicians as guests but more often could be found lobbing softballs at singers actors comedians. The 1977 interview aired over four nights and watched by more than 45 million people offered the former commander-in- chief the opportunity to shine up his tarnished image to restore some legitimacy to a sullied reign. (It also provided him with a very big paycheck.) And it gave Frost the chance to go for ratings glory and to try to extract from Nixon a confession or at the very least an acknowledgment of wrongdoing. Both men had an agenda. Both had something to prove. Frost/Nixon the adaptation of Peter Morgans play - with Frank Langella and Michael Sheen reprising their respective roles as the president and the interviewer - offers an engaging reenactment of this historic tete-a-tete. There is tension as the two sit for their gentlemanly smackdown Nixon cagey and adept; Frost at first seemingly out of his league ill-prepared but rising to the occasion. Directed by Ron Howard in an almost reflexive ""opening up"" of the stage play for the screen (lots of globe-hopping lots of hangers-on) Frost/Nixon is a must-see for political junkies history buffs and folks still fascinated by the paranoia-fueled follies of the twitchy sweaty decidedly uncharismatic 37th president. Langella doesnt exactly mimic the awkward jests and gesticulations of Tricky Dick. Instead he gets the rhythms of Nixons speech the body language and then digs deeper to find the vulnerable and self-destructive core of the man who presided over the Vietnam War brought a level of civility to U.S. relations with the Soviet Union and China and then saw everything collapse as the bungled Watergate break-in exploded into a full-scale disaster. Sheen who played Prime Minister Tony Blair in The Queen (also scripted by Morgan) is fine as Frost. The film takes pains to show Frosts ambitions his risk-taking (he borrowed heavily to produce the syndicated TV interview) his penchant for pretty women (Rebecca Hall is Frosts girlfriend looking happy just to hang around) and his belated realization that he was onto some possibly history-making revelations. Still theres a shallowness about Sheens performance. The actor shows Frost to be smooth and smiling worried and distracted but doesnt really do much more. Perhaps there wasnt much more to do - a function of Morgans screenplay and of the congenial gadabout playboy and now-knighted Frost himself? Frost/Nixon is not the epic gladiatorial face-off the ricocheting verbal shoot-out that writer Morgan and filmmaker Howard imagined. With all these tertiary characters huffing and puffing around the two principals - Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt as Frosts researchers James Reston and Bob Zelnick and Kevin Bacon as Nixons loyal aide de camp Jack Brennan - the pressure gets diffused the drama diluted. But as a historical marker a canny remembrance of a moment when politics and pop culture collided the films worth investigating.

"Frost/Nixon Well-cast prize fight pulls punches - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Nixon Frost/Nixon Well-cast prize fight pulls punchesmovies - reviewDecember 12 2008|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticIn this corner the president who resigned in disgrace the man they call ""Tricky Dick"" for good reason Richard M. Nixon.And in this corner the ultimate lightweight blow-dried disco-era ""TV presenter"" Mr. ""Hello good evening and welcome"" David Frost.Frost/Nixon the hit play now a Ron Howard movie is a ""prizefight"" recounting of the famous 1977 TV chats between the glib bon vivant Brit and the eye-gouging ""enemies list"" president. Howards workmanlike and entertaining film has wit and history and some choice performances. But its a fight without a knockout blow.We begin with a quick overview of Watergate and the Nixon resignation and pardon underscored by the real White House tapes -- Nixon threatening IRS reprisals against the press. Frank Langella doesnt so much resemble Nixon as suggest the inner ""unconvicted co-conspirator"" small enough to spend his life getting back at a world that looked down on him.Michael Sheen terrific as Tony Blair in screenwriter-playwright Peter Morgans The Deal and The Queen is brilliant as Frost suggesting a vapid dandy with an eye for the main chance without turning the easily lampooned Frost (Monty Python had a go at him) into a caricature.Frost sees the worldwide audience for Nixons farewell address. He jumps ahead of the Mike Wallaces of America by knowing the way into Nixons heart. He writes him a check. Nixon agrees to be interviewed because he needs the cash and his agent the legendary wheeler-dealer Irving ""Swifty"" Lazar (Toby Jones) promises him that the shallow Frost will deliver ""a big wet kiss.""As the ground rules are worked out (four interviews in all) the two men assemble their ""corner"" teams -- Frost a Brit producer (Matthew McFadyen) a veteran American reporter (Oliver Platt) and a passionate Nixon-hating academic James Reston played with wild-eyed verve by Sam Rockwell.""Most Americans think the man belongs in jail. Youre making him rich""Nixon has his trusty ex-military aide (Kevin Bacon) and a team that included a very young Diane Sawyer.The play and the film weigh things rather heavily in Frosts favor showing us Frosts financial gamble in the show the shallow striver who had much in common with his adversary. Langellas Nixon is the more fascinating character and despite stretches where he seems to rush the lines as if he has played the role too long (Sheen and Langella co-starred in this in London and on Broadway) the one-time Dracula gets across Nixons guile and his self-awareness. He knew he was a piece of work.The play was a theatrical event and the claustrophobia of the stage made the boxing metaphor more apt. But opening it up beyond the interviews and their prep work has the effect of pulling punches. Nixon lands his blows; Frost counters. And Ron Howard? He gets the decision but its just a decision on points.

President or something? Frost/Nixon ought to change that. Not saying it will but it should. Ron Howards film adaptation of Peter Morgans play is outstanding boasting a tremendous performance by Frank Langella as Richard M. Nixon. Somehow it turns a series of televised interviews between a disgraced former president and a lightly regarded on-the-way-down television host into an outright thrilling drama. A neat trick and Howard pulls it off with aplomb. Its all the more impressive given that Frosts interviews which took place in 1977 three years after Nixon resigned werent exactly earth-shattering news - then or now. Nixon saw them as a way to rehabilitate his image but was to some degree exposed again by the medium that had long plagued him (the televised debates with John F. Kennedy in 1960 helped lead to his defeat). Plus - and this is certainly true in the film - Nixon wanted the money the then-unheard-of 600000 that Frost ponied up for the chats. Frost too had an ulterior motive. Considered a lightweight (particularly by the Nixon camp) he wanted to establish legitimacy - and as portrayed by Michael Sheen (like Langella reprising his stage role) to reclaim a regular table at Sardis. The film begins with Nixons resignation. After coming offstage from the taping of a vapid TV show in Australia Frost catches a TV broadcast of Nixon leaving Washington and nothing if not savvy immediately wants to know how many people watched the resignation the night before. So begins an odyssey back-and-forth negotiations between Frosts people - he hires researchers played by Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt both good but underused - to get him up to speed on Nixons career though Frost shows a decided lack of interest in playing along. Nixon meanwhile is buoyed by loyal aide Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) who choreographs a performance that will allow the former president to use Frost as a stooge basically having his say unimpeded. Ever crafty Nixon isnt above knocking Frost back a step with a quip or a comment just before the cameras turn on. Clearly out of his depth Frost is steamrollered - until a fateful drunken call inspires Frost to up his game and get to work. Complaints have been lodged that playwright Morgan plays fast and loose with the facts. So what? Sometimes fiction is the best way to get at fact something that is evidenced by Langellas performance. Though hes clearly worked on perfecting the awkward gait the jowly voice he doesnt look especially like Nixon. Yet he embodies him - his essence the paranoid intelligence the need for approval. Its not an impersonation its a transformation and its brilliant. Howard keeps the pace brisk light when it needs to be heavy when thats called for. Along with Langella he turns Frost/Nixon into one of the most entertaining history lessons imaginable. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 6 2008 Save for later Saved Richard Nixon (FRANK LANGELLA) warns David Frost (MICHAEL SHEEN) in a drama that tells of the electrifying battle between a disgraced president with a legacy to save and a jet-setting television personality with a name to make. Courtesy of Ralph Nelson/Universal Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Frost/Nixon"" starring Frank Langella as Richard Nixon and Michael Sheen as David Frost is both up to the minute and past its expiration date. Directed by Ron Howard and written by Peter Morgan who expanded his celebrated stage play its about the disgraced Nixon who resigned from the presidency in 1974 and three years later for a 600000 paycheck sat for a series of interviews with the British talk-show host Frost.Frost was widely regarded at the time as a lightweight and Nixon licking his wounds in his seaside villa in San Clemente saw the sessions as a chance to rehabilitate his image. The Frost team which included attack-dog researcher James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) viewed the interviews as an opportunity to give the pardoned president ""the trial he never had.""With a backdrop this dramatic Howard and Morgan proceed to make it even more so. Not content merely to lay out the facts they frame the Frost-Nixon confrontations as full-on combat. Each fighter has his trainers his handlers his cut men. The only thing missing are referees in the ring and in a way we get those too. Borrowing a tactic from ""Reds"" Howard intermittently intercuts blow-by-blow talking-head commentary from the various aides in both camps. The film is saying politics isnt just politics its blood sport. Just in case we didnt already know this. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The movies immediacy is obvious in this election year. What seems outdated about it is the resuscitation of Nixon in the era of George W. Bush. No doubt many in the audience will look at Nixons transgressions and comparing them with Bushs conclude that he wasnt so horrible after all. In any case Morgan doesnt simplify Nixon and this is as it should be. It is a prerequisite of any principled biographer to do more than simply demonize his subject. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Frost/Nixon Oliver Stone was castigated in some quarters for not vilifying Dubya in his ""W"" but that was the least of that movies problems. Morgan a far more expansive and witty talent than Stone has made something of a specialty of inhabiting the psyche of the ruling classes. From ""The Deal"" to ""The Queen"" to ""The Last King of Scotland"" he has cast a withering yet empathetic eye on royalty.Clearly he sees Nixon as a tragic figure of near-Shakespearean proportions - Tricky Dick as Richard III. Langella fills out Morgans conception. At first its difficult to accept him as this president - the facial resemblance the gait the height the intonations are all subtly and sometimes not so subtly off. I kept expecting the entire enterprise to lapse into ""Saturday Night Live"" territory. But about halfway through the movie Langella won me over. He has a most unenviable task - impersonating a legendary public figure - but his actors wiles successfully complete the deception. His performance may be a species of stunt a high-wire act but he never falls off the wire. (For an even more daring Nixon rendition check out Philip Baker Hall in Robert Altmans 1984 ""Secret Honor."")Sheen plays Frost expertly as a quicksilver opportunist who sees his interview with Nixon as his own route to redemption. The movie makes too much of Frosts thin credentials. In fact he had previously hosted a well-regarded talk show in America that often featured leading writers and politicians. But Morgan exaggerates Frosts deficiencies for the same reason he boosts Nixons fallen-man gravitas. He wants this to be a battle of opposites.Except that ultimately Morgan has a larger agenda. In a scene he invented for the play and movie Morgan has a drunken Nixon phoning Frost up on the eve of the final interview - the all-important Watergate segment - and striking a connection based on their mutual humble beginnings. Were both underdogs Nixon is saying and no matter how successful we become the moneyed establishment will never accept us. The call is a canny attempt to throw Frost off guard but its also the closest Nixon ever comes to a cri de coeur. When he at last drops his wily assuredness and unravels in the Watergate session its as if he were handing Frost his own head on a platter. Its a cockeyed act of noblesse oblige - a fallen warrior commemorates himself by very publicly going up in flames.""Frost/Nixon"" never entirely escapes its theatrical origins and by framing the story so pugilistically the filmmakers dont bring out the full richness in this material. They take potshots at Frosts shallowness but in some ways their methodology is just as glib. Just the same its a smart and entertaining show and it harks back to a time when politics and television were still feeling each other out looking for an opening a knockout punch. Grade B.

The majesty flows not from Nixon himself though hes played phenomenally well by Frank Langella but from the spectacle of that tortured man summoning up yet again the tumultuous epoch he embodied. ENLARGE Frank Langella as Richard Nixon left and Michael Sheen as David Frost in a scene from the film ""Frost/Nixon."" Associated Press What a spectacle it is. Mr. Langella has most of the pieces of his performance in place from the start -- the seizing intelligence the ponderous physicality the cold cunning the alternate layers of stiffness and charm. Still its a performance and for a while a fairly circumspect one that declines to dwell on Nixons asperity his basso-profundo petulance and volcanic anger. But then toward the end of the extended interviews something remarkable happens as Michael Sheens Frost closes in and the camera with him on what he hopes will be the fallen presidents first mea culpa following the nightmarish sequence of events that came to be known as Watergate. Langella the actor starts to vanish and hes replaced by the spectral presence of a once-omnipotent chief of state contemplating in pitiless close-ups the nature of his deeds and the depth of his fall. Close-ups are indispensable here -- not only to the film which was directed by Ron Howard but to the original TV interviews which are available as of this week on DVD. ""The reductive power of the close-up"" is how its put by Sam Rockwell in the role of James Reston Jr. one of the writers and journalists Frost hired to shore up his production team. That power can cut every which way. TVs greatest sin is that it simplifies and diminishes Reston notes but he also says rightly that Frost succeeded in getting ""for a fleeting moment what no investigative journalist no state prosecutor no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get -- Richard Nixons face swollen and ravaged by loneliness self-loathing and defeat."" Join the DiscussionDiscuss What movies are you looking forward to this holiday season? And what have you seen already that you liked or disliked? What Ron Howard gets to a degree thats astonishing in a two-hour film is the density and complexity as well as the generous entertainment quotient of Peter Morgans screenplay. (Mr. Morgan previously wrote ""The Queen"" in which Michael Sheen played Tony Blair and ""The Last King of Scotland."") ""Frost/Nixon"" does more than dramatize the high points of the TV interviews. In the frantic run-up to the recorded interviews and during the early videotape sessions the film gives us the collateral drama of a talk-show host accustomed to celebrity chatter trying desperately to play the role of a serious journalist. ENLARGE Frank Langella ""Dont forget"" warns his producer whos played by Matthew Macfadyen ""youre in there with a major operator."" Thats an understatement; hes also in there with a master obfuscator. In the preliminary exchanges Nixon outmaneuvers his adversary at every turn. Frost may have been fed the right questions by his handlers but he cant assert himself long enough to pose them in the face of Nixons self-serving evasions and crafty ramblings to run out the clock. Yet ""Frost/Nixon"" operates on still another dramatic plane -- a battle of wits between two adversaries who turn out to be fully worthy of one another. Both men are desperate to succeed. Frost needs to revive a sagging career by selling an expensive problematic production that hes been forced to finance in large part out of his own pocket. Nixon needs to start the long process of rehabilitating himself and has been assured by his handlers that Frost an amiable lightweight will be a pushover. Untruer words have seldom been spoken unless to Sarah Palin. Michael Sheen a brilliant actor in his own right grows his character from a bright-eyed social butterfly to a gimlet-eyed interrogator who altogether plausibly finds his focus and the courage to go with it. From time to time the movie itself stands on shaky ground between show business and history -- Mr. Morgan has invented freely though not of course in the TV interviews. But its a movie in the fullest sense entertaining and instructive in equal measure with cinematography by Salvatore Totino and a supporting cast thats worthy of the co-stars. Rebecca Hall is David Frosts beautiful girlfriend Caroline Cushing Oliver Platt is the quick-witted ABC newsman Bob Zelnick and Kevin Bacon is Jack Brennan Nixons chief of staff. Walter Cronkite Eric Sevareid John Chancellor and other of their colleagues are seen as themselves in brief reminders of how valuable TV news used to be. Cadillac Records ""Cadillac Records"" may be a mess dramatically but its a wonderful mess and not just because of the great music. The people who made it must have harbored the notion almost subversive in a season of so many depressing films that going out to the movies should be fun. This particular movie which was written and directed by Darnell Martin could have been called ""Chess Records"" since thats the center of the story -- the rise and fall of the Chicago label that provided a home and surrogate family for blues legends-in-the-making. But the labels founder a young Polish emigre named Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) bought Cadillacs for his musicians when they made their first hits so the title has logic along with marketing allure. The allure of the cast cant be overstated even though Ms. Martins script seems determined to march the cast through every step along the decades-long way as the blues evolved into rock and roll. Jeffrey Wright is superb as Muddy Waters. Columbus Short is scarily mercurial as Little Walter. Ive never seen a performance quite so eerie -- effectively so -- as Eamonn Walkers Howlin Wolf whose speaking voice emanates from some mysterious cave of the winds. Mos Def whose acting grows more distinctive with each role plays the bumptious crossover prodigy Chuck Berry and Beyonce Knowles is the singular and self-destructive singer Etta James. Ms. Knowles sometimes shatters the sense of period with the sheer force of her musical personality but theres a lot to be said as ""Frost/Nixon"" demonstrates for displays of unrestrained power.

DVD TIP ENLARGE Sony BMG Ron Howard made an early splash as a director with the beguiling mermaid comedy ""Splash"" (1984) but hes no stranger to squeezing large amounts of information into movies notable for their clarity. Thats exactly what he did in ""Apollo 13"" (1995) the story of the near-fatal disaster that befell three American astronauts on their way to a lunar landing in 1970. Theyre played by Tom Hanks Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton. The exemplary script was written by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert.

". The hunter and the hunted  Cascadia Weekly . Cascadia Weekly Film Frost/Nixon The hunter and the hunted Reviewed by Peter Howell  Tuesday December 23 2008 And because of this theres a third antagonist in the picture symbolic yet no less real. Its television which through its seduction of the masses created indelible images of British interviewer David Frost as a showbiz lightweight and disgraced former U.S. president Richard Nixon as a sweating reprobate and fugitive. The TV-induced insecurities of the two men are tipped early in Ron Howards persuasive new film about their totemic 1977 encounters as both Frost and Nixon (with Michael Sheen and Frank Langella faithfully reprising their original stage roles) grapple with broadcast misconceptions. Frost bristles as people mimic his oily trademark greeting (""Hello good evening and welcome"") insisting that he doesnt really say that. Hes mocked even by his girlfriend comely socialite Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) whom Frost perhaps unwisely begins dating just as his preliminary negotiations with Nixon are heating up. Nixon preparing for his first of four taped interviews with Frost asks that he be allowed to daub his upper lip with a handkerchief after each question to remove the flop sweat that made him seem so shifty in his 1960 televised presidential campaign debates with John F. Kennedy. ""They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency"" he ruefully tells Frost. Both men hope their televised encounters will restore lost glories. Frost wants to be seen as a serious journalist in America erasing memories of a failed interview series there that sent him packing to the hinterland of Australian TV and the ignominy of celebrity puff pieces. Nixon hopes to elicit public sympathy and historical redress for the crimes of Watergate the break-in and cover-up scandal that forced him to resign in 1974. The somewhat naive Frost is convinced he can persuade the unrepentant ex-president to confess his sins on camera giving him ""the trial he never had."" The wily Nixon is convinced he can spin the Watergate questions to his advantage while pocketing the controversial 600000 (U.S.) fee arranged by L.A uber-agent Swifty Lazar (amusingly rendered by Toby Jones) that Frost has agreed to pay him. That this much drama can be wrung out of the Frost/Nixon conversations is no small achievement. Anyone old enough to remember them knows that Frost struggled mightily to control Nixons verbosity only managing to wring gripping testimony out of him in the final interview segment the one devoted entirely to Watergate. The difficulty of prying succinct answers out of Nixon consumes the middle part of the film as Frost Birt and researchers Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston (Sam Rockwell) confront the reality that a big name doesnt always make for great television. Meanwhile Nixons point man Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) an ex-Marine unaccountably dedicated to the racist sexist and paranoid former commander-in-chief vows to bury anyone who tries to bully his boss. But who exactly was the hunter and who the hunted? Both men claimed to get what they wanted from the Frost/Nixon encounters. Both felt they had ""won"" the interviews. It probably didnt matter since victory in circumstances such as these is all in the eye of the beholder and the television ""eye"" never blinks.

By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Frost/Nixon click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Also in Slate David Greenberg argues that Frost/Nixon gets Nixon right. John Dickerson says that Frost/Nixon might make George W. Bush feel better about himself. Frank Langella and Michael Sheen in Frost/Nixon Frost/Nixon (Universal) Ron Howards adaptation of Peter Morgans play about the historic 1977 television interviews between the glib British journalist and the disgraced ex-president might have punched up its box-office appeal by renaming itself Frost vs. Nixon. Taking its cues from Rocky rather than All the Presidents Men Morgans compact satisfying drama presents presidential interviewing as a gladiatorial event. Howards camera looks on with almost unseemly intimacy as these two intelligent neurotic thoroughly self-obsessed men duck feint and jab at each other in an attempt respectively to get at the truth and to tell as little of it as possible. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Nixon sat with Frost for a total of 28 hours of interviews but as per their contractual agreement it was only in the last two days that they approached the heart of the matter the Watergate burglary and the ensuing cover-up. (This portion of the real Nixon/Frost interviews has just been released on DVD.) Frosts background as a lightweight celebrity journalist in the United Kingdom along with his decidedly un-American proposal to pay Nixon for an interview left the former president and his handlers convinced that this was a reputation-saving puff piece in the making. Instead after letting Nixon hedge and pontificate his way through the first few interviews Frost nailed him to the wall on Watergate eliciting the closest thing Nixon would ever make to a confession of wrongdoing--not to mention the more chilling moment in which the former president made the now-famous assertion ""When the president does it that means its not illegal."" Frost/Nixon tells the story not only of this journalistic rumble in the jungle but of the months of power-jockeying fund-raising and test prep that went into it. Peter Morgan who wrote The Queen and The Last King of Scotland as well as the British TV drama The Deal has made a specialty out of imagining what powerful political figures (Queen Elizabeth Tony Blair Idi Amin) are like behind closed doors and while his plots tend to be heavy on symbolism (that slaughtered stag in The Queen came in awfully handy) his dialogue shows a keen political intelligence. Really though Frost/Nixons best reason for existence is to preserve the two acting showcases at its center. Frank Langella re-creates his Tony Award-winning role as Nixon. Its a strange beast of a performance Langella a solid lumbering man doesnt especially resemble the rodentlike Nixon nor does he impersonate that famous voice with Rich Little-esque accuracy. But Langella feels his way into the black hole of Nixons inner life so fearlessly that you worry for the actors sanity. His Nixon is less a shrew than a wounded bear pitiable and yet formidable. Michael Sheen who also originated his role onstage gives a less showy but equally fine performance as the ambitious insecure compulsively charming David Frost. He manages to show how overmatched Frost was in those early interviews (when sinking down in his chair as Langella dominates him Sheen looks like Dan Quayle in the 1988 debates) while making his ninth-inning rally seem both plausible and exhilarating. To prep him on the details of Nixons life and career Frost hires a research team political journalist Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and Nixon-obsessed author James Reston (Sam Rockwell). This Laurel and Hardy-like pair watches from the sidelines as Frost screws up repeatedly during the taping too self-satisfied to learn from his mistakes but careerist enough to realize that hes sinking fast. The scene in which Frost finally buckles down and dedicates himself to the preparation process is thrilling if like me youre a sucker for a good riffling-through-the-archives montage. (All the Presidents Men and Shattered Glass both had great ones.) Frost/Nixonsemotional climax is in my view the scripts weakest moment. On the eve of those last two crucial interviews Nixon makes a drunken late-night phone call to Frost in his hotel room and feeds him the oldest line in the serial-killer-vs.-cop playbook Deep down you and me were the same. Langella makes the most of this booze-sodden monologue but its central premise--that Nixon and Frost shared an insecurity about social class that fueled their drive to succeed--seems more British than American Wasnt Nixons persecution complex far too vast to be reduced to class anxiety? If our 37th president has proved such an enduring subject for on-screen fictions (see Mark Feeneys 2004 book Nixon at the Movies) its precisely because we can never finally fathom his bottomless pathologies. If we did we wouldnt have Nixon to kick around anymore. Slate V The critics takes on Frost/Nixon Cadillac Records and Nobel Son Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Its also used frequently when high school players are figuring out where to go to college. To most observers both seem like nice ""distractions"" to have - a big contract or a free education. Boys amp; Girls senior Zamal Nixon seems to be in a situation where he could fall into that trap with college coaches watching the point guards every move - and that presented coach Ruth Lovelace with a problem. ""People are in his head all the time"" Lovelace said. ""I have to tell him to focus on the team right now and I tell the coaches I just need him for a few more weeks. Hes yours after that. "" So far Lovelace has been impressed with how Nixon has handled things and yesterday with several coaches looking on just off the court he was no different. The 6-2 Nixon who transferred prior to his senior year from Xaverian led the second-seeded Kangaroos into the PSAL AA quarterfinals by scoring 18 points in an 85-70 win over No. 18 Grady. On Sunday at St. Johns the Kangaroos will play No. 7 Frederick Douglass a 64-54 winner over 10th-seeded Port Richmond. ""I try not to get caught up in it"" said Nixon who has made visits to Wichita State and Fairfield and is still being looked at by Hofstra Providence and St. Bonaventure. ""I know Im not going to make any decisions until everythings done so I dont think much about it.""  In the other second-round games No. 8 Kennedy hung on to beat No. 9 Campus Magnet 75-74 and will face top-seeded Lincoln after the Railsplitters routed No. 17 Thurgood Marshall 102-48. Fifth-seeded Canarsie beat No. 12 South Shore 83-69 and meets No. 4 Wadleigh which advanced with a 83-52 victory over No. 13 Lehman. Sixth-seeded Cardozo outlasted No. 11 Jefferson 83-75 and faces No. 3 Wings Academy a 71-52 winner over No. 14 Monroe. dan.martinnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next START PHIL HUGHES Read Next START PHIL HUGHES Share Selection Hometown Teams  FootballJetsGiants BasketballKnicksNets BaseballYankeesMets HockeyRangersIslandersDevils SoccerRed BullsNYCFC ScoreboardGOLFMLBPGA ChampionshipSpringfield New JerseyRobert Streb-9FJimmy Walker-9FJason Day-7FEmiliano Grillo-7FHenrik Stenson-6FPatrick Reed-5FBrooks Koepka-5FMartin Kaymer-5FJamie Donaldson-4FHideki Matsuyama-4FRickie Fowler-4FHarris English-4FBilly Hurley III-3FZach Johnson-3FHideto Tanihara-3FYuta Ikeda-3FWilliam McGirt-3FAdam Scott-3FJordan Spieth-3FDaniel Summerhays-3FGregory Bourdy-3FRyan Moore-2FBranden Grace-2FAlex Noren-2FPaul Casey-2FJon Curran-2FWebb Simpson-2FK.J.

Joe Neumaier Thursday December 4 2008 617 PM The camera its said never lies. But thats different from actually catching the truth which is at the heart of ""Frost/Nixon"" the film of the hit play thats sometimes static but nevertheless mesmerizing thanks to stars Michael Sheen and Frank Langella. Re-creating the roles they played in Londons West End and then on Broadway Sheen (as British TV personality David Frost) and Langella (as former President Richard Nixon) are singularly absorbing and when sitting uneasily across from each other sensational. Though director Ron Howard pushes the relevancy button too hard - the movie isnt as effective as ""Quiz Show"" or ""Good Night and Good Luck"" in using TV as a historical battering ram - ultimately all he and playwright-screenwriter Peter Morgan need to do is let the two actors channel their real-life counterparts. Thats more than enough.In March and April 1977 Nixon needing cash and hoping to rehabilitate his image some 2-1/2 years after Watergate agreed to be interviewed by Frost an apparent glad-hander eager for any extension on talk-show fame and in serious need of help from two political experts (Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell).The eventual Qamp;A done in four segments and broadcast in May 77 reveals Frost underprepared for the manipulations of a life-long pol whose admission of wrongdoing was the ultimate goal. The movie builds up to their final knockabout sit-down when Nixon blusters into that conclusion accidentally providing the closure his 1974 resignation and eventual pardon avoided.Langella a Tony winner for the role makes Nixon a lizardy smooth yet lonely figure his every moment contradicting the last. The voice and scowl can be catnip for an actor but where Philip Baker Hall underplayed them in Robert Altmans great ""Secret Honor"" and Anthony Hopkins heightened them in Oliver Stones ""Nixon"" Langella luxuriates in them turning the 37th President into a cross between a self-deluded exiled king and a tired bull fearing the final blade. In odd asides games of one-upmanship or angry defiance hes certain of both his innocence and the charm he insists he doesnt possess.Frost is complex in his own right. He knows this ""get"" could turn him from TV lightweight to journalistic powerhouse and Sheen with a toothy smile and a playboys cowlick in his long hair makes the broadcasters decision to get serious a left-hook maneuver - part of Morgans interview-as-boxing match comparisons that ought to have been more seen than stated.Platt Rockwell Kevin Bacon (as a Nixon aide) and Toby Young (as agent Swifty Lazar) are all strong. But this is Langellas show and he makes the movie his own without using a single dirty trick.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 05 2008 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Mar. 13 2009 1056AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Frost/Nixon Directed by Ron Howard Written by Peter Morgan Starring Frank Langella and Michael Sheen Classification PG  Really only a single Brit had the credentials to dissect the riven heart and the worrisome legacy of Richard Nixon. But since Shakespeare wasnt available denying us what might have been his greatest history play the world made do with David Frost. And so on a televised set back in 1977 a series of interviews pitted the arch political villain of the time against a British chat-show host with a reputation as lightweight as his blow-dried do. It seemed before the bell rang for the first round like a recipe for turning tragedy into farce - like watching Richard III getting grilled by Feste the clown. Such is the starting point of Frost/Nixon an engaging period piece adapted by Peter Morgan from his own stage play and directed by Ron Howard who has a vested interest in promoting that boxing metaphor - in essence this is Cinderella Man with verbal punches. But before the main bout comes the preliminaries a montage designed to inform the uninitiated of the blood already spilled A sitting president forced to resign because of abuse-of-power allegations arising from the Watergate scandal; almost immediately pardoned by his successor and thus allowed to remain unrepentant never offering a wounded nation the confession it needs; now living in well-appointed exile at his seaside retreat writing a self-serving memoir for a princely sum. Enter on the other side Frost the featherbrain or so it was perceived Here was a comic who cut his teeth on satire but had devolved into vacuous banter with empty-headed celebrities and then slid off the map to some TV gig way Down Under. There he hatched an unlikely plan to bag a Nixon interview and sell it to the highest bidder. At this early point despite their vast differences the opponents are also shown to hold two traits firmly in common (1) a keen interest in making money and (2) an equally ardent desire to brush up their tarnished image. This is where Morgans script and the title cast - both Frank Langella and Michael Sheen are reprising much-applauded stage performances - nicely intersect allowing the principals to explore these surprising similarities even while plumbing the obviously stark contrasts. For example Sheen paints Frost as a buoyant and genial populist aware of his critics but content to smile in their face. Serving as his own producer he is basically a bottom-line impresario intent on mounting a lucrative show. In that sense Sheen isnt far from his Tony Blair portrayal in The Queen (also written by Morgan) - each of these men has a keen appreciation for the value of political theatre. So does Nixon of course a pol whose checkered past that four-act litany of triumph and defeat and resurrection and disgrace is nothing if not theatrical. No wonder the guy is a thespians delight and Langella takes every advantage. As the narrative progresses from pretaping negotiations to the interviews themselves he resists the easy caricature and seizes the chance to roam across the full range of those deliciously Nixonian traits - the cunning thoughtfulness the insecure confidence the sacred profanity the awkward charm the self-pity palmed off as candour and above all the weirdly inadvertent honesty the face that always betrayed him by speaking the very truths that his mouth tried so hard to conceal. (His face was the video equivalent of the audio tapes he couldnt bring himself to burn.) Yes Nixon was the sort of complicated bad actor that only a really good actor can play. Prior to the big match the movie finds a little comedy in the travails of the frustrated handlers in Frosts corner. Heavily armed with facts and figures James Reston and Bob Zelnick (Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt) are desperate to give the villain ""the trial he never had"" but their undertrained boy is the picture of insouciance a gadfly who forever darting out to dine at chic eateries still doesnt know his Haldeman from his Ehrlichman. So as always in these Rocky-esque cases the early rounds go to the favourite - Nixon bobs and weaves in masterfully rambling digressions. Only in the later going does the underdog land the climactic blow forcing the sought-after admission and an apology of sorts ""I let down the country."" However before this telling exchange Frost elicits from Nixon a blunt assertion that would prove far more prophetic ""When the president does it that means its not illegal."" Given a current administration that has governed on precisely that precept the contemporary resonance is clear. But its a resonance that the film doesnt actively pursue. Rather it falls into a common and complacent trap into the conventional wisdom that the legacy of Watergate represents the triumph of truth over lies of justice served by hard-digging journalists and an eventually brave Congress. But the competing view suggests that the actual lessons of Watergate mastered by the likes of Lee Atwater and Karl Rove are far less benign. In this interpretation Nixons failure was not in using lies and dirty tricks but in misusing them in not mastering the art of the lie. Over the next decades of campaigning reaching its zenith in the Dubya White House that art got refined to the point where the brazen falsehood (John Kerry was a Swift Boat coward Saddam was behind 9/11) ceased to matter - all that counted and all that the media discussed was the spun lies potential for political success. At worst these competing legacies are debatable yet in Frost/Nixon as in most Watergate revisitations the debate doesnt even take place. Instead once again dogged virtue rises off the canvas to land the final punch defeating villainy and bringing a sour chapter in American history to a sweet end. Shakespeare would have delighted in the chapter especially in the antagonist but not at the expense of the longer and darker and still-unfinished book.

Ralph Nelson/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Ralph Nelson/Universal Pictures The trick is you see Frank Langellas Nixon runs rhetorical circles around Frost in the early going. Ralph Nelson/Universal Pictures There was something centrally disreputable about the Frost-Nixon interviews back in 1977. The former president had resigned in disgrace after the Watergate scandal but because he received a pardon from his successor in the Oval Office he never stood trial or admitted wrongdoing -- until three years later when he broke his public silence on Watergate in interviews with British talk-show host David Frost. Those interviews were among the most-watched news programs in TV history -- but they were suspect as journalism not least because Nixon got paid a lot of money for doing them. And because Frost was a lightweight TV personality who wasnt even from the U.S. no one really expected him to outwit a seasoned politico who was -- not for nothing -- known as Tricky Dick. Even Frosts researchers had their doubts. They wanted to give Nixon the trial hed never had but the wily old politician ran rings around his questioner in the first few days of interviews. Despair set in quickly for everyone -- except Frost. Frost/Nixon was originally written for the stage where it depended so much on the notion of a David and Goliath mismatch that it could almost have been called Froth-Nixon. Thats less true on screen though theres still something a little glib about Peter Morgans script which spends an awful lot of time making Michael Sheens David Frost out to be a comic dilettante. Opposite him Frank Langellas Nixon doesnt look merely presidential but kind of Shakespearean -- a tragic figure rather than a guy who covered up a burglary. Happily director Ron Howard takes a quasi-documentary approach that has the effect of giving Frost more heft on screen -- theres news footage plus behind-the-scenes shots of TV monitors all conspiring to make it clear that hes better at using this emotionally cool medium than Nixon especially in the interviews big showdown. Langellas Nixon isnt an impersonation -- you could find other actors whod do that guttural growl more persuasively -- but he and Sheen are great foils for each other as the old mans defenses finally begin to crumble. Regardless its not their sparring but the presentation of it thats meant to grab you. Because a case is being made here that it wasnt really Frost who did Nixon in It was Nixons old nemesis the TV camera -- that unblinking eye capturing every bead of perspiration every nervous shift of posture every furrow in a guilt-ridden presidential brow. Its a case the stage version of Frost/Nixon made an intellectual argument for buttressed by a wall of TV screens. But theater being a medium of words and film a medium of images -- well here the case is made visceral in merciless close-ups blown up so much larger than life.

Guess who wins? Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News The playwright and screenwriter Peter Morgan is so skillful that he almost -- almost -- makes a convincing case that its time to humanize Richard Nixon to recognize him as a flawed unhappy man who just happened to believe it was his right as president to cheat the American people. But the movie version of Morgans play ""Frost/Nixon"" directed by Ron Howard (and adapted by Morgan himself) dances cautiously up to that line where we might be tempted to think ""Poor guy"" -- and then cannily refuses to cross it. ""Frost/Nixon"" -- which stars Michael Sheen and Frank Langella reprising the roles they played in the stage version -- details the conception planning and taping of the series of interviews that British talk-show host David Frost conducted with Nixon in the spring of 1977. Before the interviews aired Frost was (at least in the movies terms) considered a softball interviewer a TV personality rather than a journalist a lightweight who wouldnt ask the tough questions that say Mike Wallace might have. At one point Nixons agent Swifty Lazar played by a begoggled Toby Jones assures his client ""Itll be a big wet kiss"" and sure enough in the early hours of Frosts questioning the disgraced but undaunted former president responds with answers so ponderous convoluted and evasive it seems certain hell sabotage Frosts enterprise. Flaunting his disdain for the American people as Nixon had some three years earlier wasnt enough Now he was going to bore us to death.But by the time the Frost-Nixon interviews wound to a close -- in real life the 29 hours of taped footage were edited and aired over five nights -- Frost thanks to some wiliness and a little bit of luck had coaxed his slippery subject into a tacit admission of guilt in the Watergate scandal. And right there Ive gone ahead and given away the ending to ""Frost/Nixon"" -- but this is a story in which what happens is far less interesting than how it happens. Howard has made a picture for grown-ups a well-constructed entertainment that neither talks down to its audience nor congratulates it just for showing up. Thats particularly refreshing around holiday time when the studios roll out all their big Oscar-bait pictures bestowing upon us their most boring stately and somber works -- anything that spells ""quality"" with a capital ""Q"" even if genuine craftsmanship is sorely missing.Somehow Howard has pulled off the feat of adapting a play for the big screen without making it seem like a sorry clumsy creature thats lost its way. Theres no question that Morgan and Howard have tweaked some of the facts to give the story more dramatic shape and heft The movie paints Frost -- who now has a ""Sir"" before his name and an ""OBE"" after it and who hosts a weekly show on Al-Jazeera English -- as more of a washed-up has-been than he really was at the time and it doesnt mention that hed already interviewed Nixon in 1968 apparently treating the then-presidential candidate with some pretty soft kid gloves. (After the election Nixon even brought Frost and his mother to the White House which suggests that the two had a fairly cordial relationship at one time.)But the tension Morgan sets up between the two men -- anxiety that also extended to their handlers -- is still wholly believable. According to ""Frost/Nixon"" the disgraced president hoped to use the interviews as an opportunity to set the record straight and to make some money -- he raked in at least 600000 for his appearance. And Frost wanted not just to make good television (as well as obviously money). He also wanted to lure Nixon into speaking plainly about his transgressions. Frost enlisted two researchers to help him prepare for the interview seasoned TV-news reporter Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) son of the famed journalist James ""Scotty"" Reston whod already written several damning works about the former president and who wanted nothing more than to trip him up publicly. Kevin Bacon plays Jack Brennan Nixons loyal aide who offers his boss helpful advice and encouragement on a number of topics including rendering an opinion on whether or not Frosts Italian leather loafers are ""effeminate."" (The verdict is that they are.) You Might Also Like Howard keeps the filmmaking simple and succinct with no fancy cutting or obtrusive music (the score is by an uncharacteristically restrained Hans Zimmer). The focus is on the performances Sheen who played Tony Blair in Morgans other story about a leader with a sense of entitlement ""The Queen""  plays Frost as an ingratiating presence with a brain Hes an obsequious wheeler-dealer persistently flashing a smile made up of too many teeth. But when he finally catches his adversary off-guard we get a sense of how sharp those teeth are. The moment is satisfying and it feels earned.Langellas Nixon is pleasurable to watch in a way that makes you want to take a shower immediately afterward. The performance is a marvel of impersonation and at times it cuts to something deeper than mere character tics and vocal phrasing In Langellas Nixon we see a roiling brew of suspicion paranoia and self-loathing thats been fermenting for years possibly since childhood. We also see a guy who just never had the common touch who never liked people and who had to learn not to care when people didnt like him. In ""Frost/Nixon"" he eyes Frosts dishy girlfriend Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) and asks his interviewer in a way that shows he has no conception of his own crassness if hed done any fornicating the night before -- a line that like much of the dialogue in ""Frost/Nixon"" comes straight from real life. Im sure there will be lots of talk about how ""Frost/Nixon"" is relevant today Lord knows its become something of a parlor game to compare and contrast George W. with Richard M. to debate whos done more damage to the country whos more underhanded more loathsome. It remains to be seen wholl win that contest but for now ""Frost/Nixon"" resurrects a few of the creepy-crawly memories of the 37th president that some of us would rather keep buried. Before Nixon sits down with Frost he shows his interviewer the handkerchief that hes going to be clutching just out of the cameras range Occasionally off-camera hell need to dab the sweat off his upper lip; he explains to Frost that hed been told his profuse sweating lost him the presidency in 1960 and he states this ""fact"" so baldly that its clear hes talked himself into believing it -- into believing that just being too sweaty is enough to make the public mistrust and dislike you.Nixon had plenty of other things working against him -- those darting eyes those stuttering evasions -- but his faith in that handkerchief is a measure of how much he thought he could get away with. This Nixon believes that as long as he can clutch that hanky hell be fine. In the end ""Frost/Nixon"" doesnt redeem Nixon or absolve him of his sins and it doesnt end on a note of triumph either It accepts Frosts trumping of Nixon as just a momentary victory. Because no matter what sins Richard M. Nixon admitted to on national television he never had to mop up his own mess. He left that to us; our disillusionment was his legacy.

Starring Frank Langella and Michael Sheen. Directed by Ron Howard. (R. 110 minutes. At the Metreon. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Screenwriter Peter Morgans ability to dramatize recent history rests on his unerring instinct for what to emphasize and what to play down. Like the visual artist who finds the lines through which to simulate three-dimensional objects Morgan finds the right elements of action and character through which to make history leap off the page. Morgans facility is somewhere between genius and a knack and his methods are a mix of the inspired and the gimmicky. But on the basis of ""The Queen"" ""The Deal"" (about the friendship and rivalry of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown) and now ""Frost/Nixon"" one thing can be pinned down as certain This mans work is irresistible. ""Frost/Nixon"" is based on Morgans Broadway hit of the same name and brings back its two principals Michael Sheen as David Frost and Frank Langella as Richard Nixon. The film directed by Ron Howard tells of the events surrounding Frosts 1977 series of interviews with the former president the first Nixon gave following his resignation in 1974. Most interviews are contests of a kind but Morgan turns Frosts Nixon interviews into a battle for survival. It doesnt matter whether this is historically accurate or not. Morgan creates the drama and through the drama we engage with the broader facts. In a similar way in order to emphasize the contrast between Frost and Nixon - and to highlight the improbability of Frosts being the one to land these interviews - Morgan portrays Frost as an airy playboy the person least likely to interview a crafty politician and get something important out of him. In fact in 1977 Frosts reputation in the United States was that of a serious penetrating interviewer. Though not a political journalist by any means neither was he Johnny Carson or Regis Philbin. Frosts intellectual doggedness - his ego investment in being just the man to get at the truth - made it clear to everyone going in that Nixon would have to be on his toes. But Morgan would have us believe that Frost went in like David versus Goliath. Again thats all for the best. The mild distortion serves Morgans dramatic purpose and also allows him to underline some true contrasts in Frost and Nixons natures. Frost was (and is) a bon vivant; Nixon a loner. Frost was a ladies man while Nixon married the first woman who was nice to him. Frost liked people and was liked by them; Nixon never fit in. Both from modest means Frost cultivated a taste for luxury while Nixons habits remained austere. The sheer fun of ""Frost/Nixon"" - and fun is the right word - is not only in watching these men in collision. Its also in watching them together in the same frame as two contrasting aspects of humanity. If ""The Queen"" in the end became a kind of buddy film (between Elizabeth II and Tony Blair) ""Frost/Nixon"" has a touch of that same appeal at least in the emotional sense We see two people from completely different universes and ways of life come to some understanding. They know without knowing it that each could use a touch of what the other one has. Langella avoids doing a direct impression of Nixon. Rather he suggests his voice and manner while trying to convey a sense of Nixons internal life. His is not a send-up but a spiritual investigation and the Nixon he gives us is a man whos lonely and limited - and knows it. Sheens Frost is a more charming creation but every bit as complex - a high-stakes player disguised as a dandy a man of greater political gifts than Nixon himself who never betrays a negative emotion even under murderous stress who cultivates an image of unflappability even in the face of rejection - and even as hes risking his entire fortune to pay Nixon and syndicate the interviews himself. Howard directs the film with ennobling effacement He takes a terrific screenplay and brings out all its virtues. We get to see Frosts research staff sweating it out behind the scenes - played by Oliver Platt Sam Rockwell and Matthew Macfadyen with colorful and fretting vividness. Finally by the time the actual interview is about to start Morgan and Howard have us primed as though for gladiatorial combat. Through some brilliant sleight of hand - and some inspired combination of selection and invention - they deliver. -- Advisory This film contains strong language.

It helps that the two people are disgraced President Richard M. Nixon and British charm boy David Frost the TV interviewer who waved millions in front of the Watergate trickster to lure him on camera for the trial he never had. Ancient history? Well the interview took place in 1977 and we know the outcome in advance. ""I let down the American people"" Nixon admitted to Frost and an audience of more than 45 million. All the more remarkable then that director Ron Howard has turned Peter Morgans stage success into a grabber of a movie laced with tension stinging wit and potent human drama. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Start with ""magnificent"" to describe Frank Langellas bone-deep performance as Nixon. Its one for the time capsule. What Langella does is less imitation than total immersion. He gets the mans cunning paranoia failed charm and inescapable sadness. Its clear that the Tony Award he won wont be the last prize Langella collects for this role of a lifetime. Cheers too for Michael Sheen so good as Tony Blair in Morgans The Queen who plays Frost with a level of fear bristling just under his smooth confidence. Frost knows pulling off this interview could be a career maker or breaker. And he knows he cant do it alone. He brings on journalists Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) whose animus toward the ex-president borders on personal vendetta. One fun scene involves Reston meeting Nixon and stumbling through a timid hello. ""Oh that was devastating"" says Zelnick with a laugh. Nixon living with his frail wife Pat (Patty McCormack) at a villa by the sea in San Clemente California charges an ex-Marine Col. Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) with his prep work. Bacon is exceptional showing the genuine warmth of a man whose main job is to save Nixon from his own hubris. Howard infuses the four taped interviews held in the home of a Nixon friend with palm-sweating suspense. Its a kick to watch Nixon throw Frost off his game with an off-color remark. ""Do any fornicating last night?"" the prez asks his inquisitor just before the cameras roll. Frost seizes the day in the end going in for the kill on Watergate. On the night before the last interview a slurring drunk Nixon phones Frost and sentimentally links them as victims of a class system that will always keep them on the outside looking in. The phone call is pure fiction but deeply affecting nonetheless a dramatists way into the head of a man who can never be known from the cold facts alone. Langellas playing of it is quietly phenomenal. Howard does his most ingenious directing to date by using the interviews as a way to peel back the layers that create a public image. As such Nixon has never seemed more accountable or more shockingly exposed. Frost/Nixon one of the years best films far exceeds its roots as docudrama. It cuts to the core of a toxic culture that sees politics as show business a culture still all too recognizable as our own.

Langellas Richard Nixon longs to rehabilitate his public image after the long national nightmare of Watergate and a tidal wave of bad press and public derision. Sheens David Frost in turn wants to prove to a snickering world that hes more than just a blow-dried entertainer at home chatting with starlets and celebrities but woefully out of his league conducting a makeshift prosecution of a former president of prodigious intellectual gifts and ferocious intensity. Ron Howard directed the film but its auteur is undoubtedly playwright-screenwriter Peter Morgan (The Queen The Deal The Last King Of Scotland) who continues his ongoing exploration of the 20th century as filtered through crucial interpersonal relationships. Frost/Nixon dramatizes a legendary series of interviews between Langellas disgraced former president and Sheens globetrotting international playboy who wears his megawatt smile like armor. Langella agrees to the interviews both as a way of picking up easy money and as a means of finally conquering his old foe the television that infernal beast that helped cost him the 1960 election. Langella sees the interviews as conversational blood sport a verbal sparring match between himself and a glass-jawed lightweight of a foe but he underestimates his opponent and pays a steep price for his arrogance. The film consequently has the emotional arc of a sports movie with the overmatched underdog enduring a vicious beating before staging a stunning comeback. Howard hammers home the boxing metaphor a little too hard; he doesnt always trust the power of Morgans words and the mesmerizing performances of his perfectly cast leads. Yet Frost/Nixon finds an intriguing new angle on one of historys most documented and fascinating figures. In a masterful performance Langella highlights Nixons oily charm and guile; theres a reason an ugly unpleasant man with a hangdog face gravelly voice perpetual 5 oclock shadow and sad eyes rose from nothing to become the most powerful man in the world. This is Nixon at his debate-club-president best though he can only refrain from self-sabotage for so long. Sheens Frost may like to think he landed the knockout blow but in the end only Nixon can defeat Nixon.

As opposed to what--Nixon the horse?"" grumbles Tricky Dick (Frank Langella) when his agent Swifty (Toby Jones) lays out the four segments of his upcoming interview with British pop television personality David Frost (Michael Sheen). Eager to burnish his reputation Frost laid out over half-a-million of his own cash upfront to score Nixons first interview after resigning office. Frost was certain the networks would snatch it up; they didnt as the common Washington wisdom was that he was better suited to interviewing the Bee Gees. Both men were desperate for public approval--a parallel writer Peter Morgan draws distinctly in his Tony-nominated play and now in this brisk film directed by Ron Howard. An opening montage sets up Frost and Nixons 1977 collision Three-and-a-half years after leaving the White House Nixon was biding his time at the golf courses of Yorba Linda (a game he claimed he hated) while waiting for the public to forgive him for Watergate and welcome him back to D.C. It wasnt likely. Among Americans many grievances was his refusal to admit wrong-doing--an unpardonable omission even in the era before the de rigueur televised apology. People thought hed gotten off lightly; if Nixon agreed he wasnt about to confirm it. Coached by advisers Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) and Diane Sawyer (Kate Jennings Grant) Nixon steadied himself for the interview he hoped would be his first step towards redemption. In Frosts corner were John Birt (Matthew Macfayden) Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) the latter of whom hungered for Nixons blood like a moon-starved werewolf. The interviews spread out over 12 two-hour sessions are framed like boxing matches. Each man sees this as his personal moment of Rocky glory (the movie had come out the year before) and while the metaphor is over-played its apt. Before their final verbal duel Howard shows us Nixon warming up by jogging in a sweat suit over triumphant music. And in case we miss the point Nixon hammers it home in nearly every exchange with the feckless Frost--though to be fair playboy Frost was late in grasping his warning much to his counselors frustration. In the films centerpiece scene the president calls up the dilettante and drunkenly tells him that theyre both poor kids whove earned their success--and the scars of class resentment that came with the climb--thus spelling out another of Morgans analyses. Its a knockout scene and would be even better if it were true but failing actual honesty its a powerful moment of emotional honesty. Langella and Sheen played the roles on Broadway Langella--who has the showier part--racking up several awards and nominations in the process. It goes without saying that both actors are excellent but Ill say it again because they deserve it. Langella looks so little like Nixon hes introduced doing the former presidents two-fingered salute as if wed have no idea who he was if he had just slipped into the frame wearing a suit. In profile his nose--or whatever putty theyve added to his nose--is fine and with our eyes closed his accurate voice rumbles and pauses and ruminates and charges ahead bullishly. Like W. and like Morgans earlier film The Queen Frost/Nixons skill is that it humanizes history books and the leaders in them with tarnished names. More so than the other films Morgan and Howard are dealing not with a monkey fool or a stone monarch but the 20th centurys most human president save perhaps Bill Clinton. Nixon sweated and fretted and plotted with the same urgency he would have had if he had never been more than a grocery store manager. Here when he finally stops outrunning his past we want nothing more than to offer him a hug and a handkerchief to wipe his brow. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

"Frost/Nixon | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; frost-nixon ) Frost/Nixon (United States/United Kingdom/France 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli ""Never let the facts get in the way of a good story"" or so the saying goes. With Frost/Nixon director Ron Howard and playwright/screenwriter Peter Morgan have taken this precept to heart. With this movie a fictionalized account of real events the filmmakers have fashioned a powerful and compelling duel between two iconic figures that despite liberties taken with known facts provides a few hard-earned truths and a complex portrait of one of the most controversial individuals to sit in the Oval Office. Especially in an era when the publics view of the presidency (and the man who holds it) has dropped to historic lows it would be easy to demonize Nixon. By avoiding that lazy and easy pathway Howard and Morgan have transformed this story into something more than an embellished re-telling of recent history. They have shaped a tragedy that is almost Shakespearean in force. Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) resigned on August 9 1974 two years after the Watergate break-in that resulted in the cover-up conspiracy that brought down his presidency. For the better part of three years he remained in exile in California shunning the media and not giving any interviews - until a British talk-show host by the name of David Frost (Michael Sheen) offered him 600000 to sit down for a series of interviews covering four subjects domestic policy foreign policy ""Nixon the man"" and Watergate. Seeing an opportunity to rehabilitate his image and imagining that Frost would offer softball questions Nixon agreed. For Frost it represented a mammoth gamble. Not only did he not have a ready buyer for the interviews but the idea of a talk-show host embarking upon an act of serious journalism was universally dismissed. Even Frosts three allies - John Burt (Matthew McFadyen) James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) and Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) - were not without skepticism. Only his girlfriend Caroline (Rebecca Hall) stuck unwaveringly by his side. About 50% of the film is re-created material from the interviews often shifted shaped and edited to increase the drama. Obviously a great deal had to be cut since the broadcast versions of the interviews spanned six hours (with many additional hours of footage not shown) and Howard wisely concentrates on the segments that are remembered and/or made history. For a while the interviews represent a duel of wits between Nixon and Frost with the older more experienced man continually gaining the upper hand and deflecting every thrust no matter how expertly played that Frost could provide. But Watergate Nixons undoing in life was also his undoing in the interview. For the millions who watched the Watergate interview on television the crowning moment came when Frost prodded Nixon to admit to being involved in a cover-up and to apologize to the American people. For many including those Americans who had felt cheated when President Ford had pardoned Nixon it was a moment of vindication. For Frost it assured him of a long and prosperous lifestyle and recognition as more than a talk show host. For Nixon ironically it was not the end. The admission allowed him to move beyond Watergate and despite the films assertion to the contrary he achieved a degree of rehabilitation in the public eye. Presidents Reagan Bush (Sr.) and Clinton all turned to him for advice and at the time of his death far more was said about his positive legacy as a foreign policy guru than about Watergate. Nixon will always be linked inextricably with Watergate but the Frost interviews allowed him to enter a new phase of life. The two original leads from the London and Broadway versions of the play Frank Langella and Michael Sheen reprise their roles for the film. Sheen who may be best known to movie goers as Tony Blair in The Queen portrays Frost as a playboy and dilettante a man obsessed with celebrity culture and disinterested in politics. Sheen has the boyish charm to pull this off and to present Frost in the classic role of the underdog. Frosts naivetA(c) allows him to be overmatched in the early rounds of their struggle but Nixons overconfidence paves the way for his downfall. Langella has a much harder job and his success makes it a bigger triumph. Heres where the Oscar nomination belongs (and where the Tony was awarded). By taking on the larger-than-life part of Nixon Langella portrays a man whose image and mannerisms are known to every person older than age 30. Langella doesnt look or sound much like the late 37th President and beyond combing his hair in a certain way and adding a little gravel to his voice he doesnt go for mimicry. Yet through sheer force of performance he embodies Nixon. Midway through the film an amazing transformation occurs. Suddenly were no longer looking at a re-creation were seeing Nixon. This is the same thing that Anthony Hopkins did in Oliver Stones Nixon and that Josh Brolin failed to do in W. Whats more Nixon is not portrayed as a villain. He is shown as the classic tragic figure - someone brought down by a fatal flaw. Frost/Nixon indicts him but in doing so never forgets that Nixon was a human being. Ill leave it to more detailed articles to provide meticulous lists of where the script deviates from reality but there are a few instances worth a brief mention. Nixons view on power and the Presidency (""When the President does it that means that it is not illegal"") was not part of the Watergate interview as portrayed here. The climactic sequence of the Watergate interview was not interrupted in exactly the manner shown in the film. And perhaps most importantly there was no late-night drunken conversation about cheeseburgers - although it should be mentioned that this scene is one of the most dramatically potent ones in the entire film and provides insight into both of the title characters. The tone of Frost/Nixon is staid and sure as befits a movie with this subject but there are powerful dramatic currents roiling beneath the sometimes calm surface. Its a forceful unrelenting movie that folds back time and recalls albeit imperfectly according to the public record how a long national nightmare finally faded. Its a David vs. Goliath story where even the loser gained something. And above all is causes us to ponder the truth or lack thereof of Shakespeares unforgettable words ""The evil that men do lives after them. The good is oft interred with their bones."" In a way Nixons presidency was buried during that final interview with Frost. But it gave his legacy a chance at new life. Had he denied to his dying day in 1994 he would have been forever viewed with scorn.

Langella about a mid-1970s confrontation between a wily British TV host and a ? disgraced American president. Doubt is a fictional drama starring Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman about a mid-1960s confrontation between an imperious Bronx nun in charge of a parochial school and a liberal priest she is convinced has behaved improperly with a student. The two might seem to have nothing in common save that both previously enjoyed award-laden Broadway runs and both are currently receiving Prestige Movie treatment. But the pair taken together constitute a rewarding study in the opportunities and pitfalls of adaptation. Frost/Nixon directed with practiced fluidity by Ron Howard surges with an energy and visual verve that improve the play and enhance the themes of dramatist Peter Morgans script -- about the codependency of media and politics and about the vanities of ambitious men shaping public images. Doubt fussily overdirected by its author John Patrick Shanley dulls the plays own sharp inquiries into the dangerous power of those who profess certainty with God on their side. Frost/Nixon trusts Sheen and Langella to re-create the roles they first originated to such acclaim in London in 2006 then moved to Broadway in 2007. Certainly the two stars know their characters inside and out Theres David Frost the striving TV-age smoothie who savored his jet-set lifestyle but craved journalistic legitimacy; and theres Richard M. Nixon the infinitely complicated politician forced to resign in the wake of Watergate who craved -- well obviously he craved something since he agreed (for a handsome fee) to sit with Frost through 12 days of taped interrogation. With the transcript as his guide Morgan explores psychological terrain how Frost found the chutzpah to land the interviews; how Nixon played cat and mouse with his interlocutor when asked to admit wrongdoing and apologize; how both men of humble beginnings felt stung by the scorn of those born with more ?privilege; and how both were superb manipulators. But Sheen (who played the very model of a modern British go-getter as Tony Blair in The Queen also written by Morgan) and Langella (operating at the peak of his powers) are disciplined enough to crop their performances to close-up size. (The sizing echoes the look of the ? actual interviews.) And Howard is smart ? to enhance the one-on-ones with journalistic context weaving archival Watergate-era ? footage into his fictionalized re-creation. Streep and Hoffman in contrast translate roles memorably created by Cherry Jones and Brian F. OByrne as Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn. Without a doubt the movie stars are primo ""gets"" in the famous-name sweepstakes. (Theyre aided by Viola ? Davis in a blazing brief appearance as the mother of the boy who may or may not have received the priests inappropriate attentions and by Amy Adams in the wan role of a susceptible younger nun who becomes the agent of Sister Aloysius terrible righteousness.) But Hoffman and Streep especially are also vulnerable actors in need of guidance from a director with a strong vision. And Shanley in his first movie-helming gig since he leaped into his own script for Joe Versus the Volcano nearly two decades ago and lost turns out to have dismayingly few original cinematic notions to back up the basic did-he-or-didnt-he hook in his study of conviction and compassion. Theres not a wind-whipped leaf rain-hammered window or burned-out lightbulb the director doesnt admire lest we ignore a metaphor about spiritual crisis. Meanwhile Streep apparently left to her own devices lugs a load of mannerisms under the pruny nuns severe black habit encouraged by the movies literal-minded director. Sister A may be an intimidating spirit-breaking character -- but for all that shes also ? a servant of God unswerving in her code of right and wrong and we ought to feel her burden. We dont. Speaking lines written to reach the stage heavens the cast is infernally noisy and hectoring about mysteries that ought ? to be felt with a communal hush. I doubt thats what the creator -- I mean the playwright -- had in mind.

The suspense arises from the fact that Nixon and the people around him agreed to the interview in the first place only because they failed to take Frost seriously as a television journalist and hence regarded him as no major obstacle to the rehabilitation of Nixons image with the American people. The flawless casting extends to the warring inner circles surrounding David Frost and Richard Nixon. Matthew Macfadyen as John Birt Mr. Frosts savvy and diplomatic producer is almost unrecognizable from the no-nonsense hero he plays in the BBC espionage series MI-5. Sam Rockwells James Reston Jr. and Oliver Platts Bob Zelnick are a study in contrasts as Frosts crackerjack team of researchers The young Reston is a fiery ideologue always on the verge of blowing his fuse; the jovial Zelnick no less ideologically committed is possessed of a wry sense of humor that keeps him in a state of emotional equilibrium even in the darkest moments of the Frost enterprise when it looks as if Nixon is going to win his bid for public vindication. Mr. Howard and Mr. Morgan have very astutely established Frosts mercurial personality in advance by having him brazenly pick up Rebecca Halls all-too-willing Caroline Cushing on a Concorde flight from Australia to California. Indeed the impression is given that Mr. Frost habitually makes passes at any lone and attractive woman on his many worldwide flights. Nixons chief of staff the retired and amply bemedalled U.S. Marine officer Jack Brennan is played with worshipful solemnity by Kevin Bacon. The rest of the Nixon group includes former Nixon speechwriters Ken Khachigian (Gabriel Jarret) and Raymond Price (Jim Meskimen) as well as former White House aide and later television news star Diane Sawyer (Kate Jennings Grant). Patty McCormack makes a brief appearance as the fragile and ailing Pat Nixon. Toby Jones serves as an intermediary in the interview negotiations as the legendary Hollywood agent Swifty Lazar. The interview sessions themselves take on the ferocity of ancient gladiatorial contests though the two antagonists come to respect and admire the unleashed abilities of the other. Mr. Langella in particular strikes notes of pathos and vulnerability that make him both a worthy co-protagonist and a recognizable human being. Who ever knew back then that the day would come when we would actually miss ""Tricky"" Dick Nixon in the White House? The production establishes an eerie semblance of authenticity through the seemingly casual cinematography of Salvatore Totino the creative choice of backgrounds by production designer Michael Corenblith and the non-jarring costume design by Daniel Orlandi of the clothes people wore more than 30 years ago. There is even a joke shared between Nixon and Frost over the latters alleged predilection for ""effeminate"" Italian shoes. With the awards season swirling around us Mr. Langella and Mr. Sheen will be hard to overlook when all the prizes are dispensed. And the picture itself should be on many must-see and 10-best lists all honors it richly deserves. Almost needless to say I recommend Frost/Nixon highly to all my readers. asarrisobserver.com Comment Filed under At the Movies Frank Langella Frost/Nixon Kevin Bacon Michael Sheen movie Oliver Platt Toby Jones Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2008/12/ifrostnixoni-actually-makes-me-miss-tricky-dick/,200,frostnixon39,frostnixon,com/2008/12/ifrostnixoni-actually-makes-me-miss-tricky-dick/

Hoberman Langella and Sheen Capture a Summit of Egos in Frost/Nixon Wednesday December 3 2008 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Langella is a naturally menacing Nixon.Ralph Nelson A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - I hear America singing and I see . . . Richard Nixon. Not the man but the muse Has any president since Lincoln inspired more movies TV mini-series and operas? Just as Nixons beetle brows ski nose and mirthless grin were made for caricature so his rampant pathology was a gift for novelists and psycho-historians.Frost/Nixon dutifully directed by Ron Howard from screenwriter Peter Morgans enjoyably glib play is the latest installment of the Nixoniad appropriately set in a media hall of mirrors. The subject is not Watergate but its aftermath--the series of four televised interviews with the disgraced 37th president that British chat star David Frost orchestrated and syndicated in the spring of 1977 a little less than three years after Nixons resignation.The interviews were the subject of intense interest even before they happened. The media hyped itself. The details of the deal including Nixons 600000 payday were breathlessly reported. Mike Wallace created an anticipatory meta-event by interviewing interviewer Frost on 60 Minutes; the event itself rated the cover of TV Guide as well as Time. Devoted largely to Watergate and including what was taken to be Nixons apology the first interview was among the top shows of 1977 attracting 45 million viewers. The mimic David Frye then known as the worlds greatest Nixon impersonator modified his act--restaging the interview and taking both parts. Frost and Nixon each produced follow-up bestsellers with Frosts behind-the-scenes account I Gave Them a Sword serving as the basis for Morgans 2006 play a hit first in London and then New York.A docudramatist whose screen credits include The Queen and The Last King of Scotland Morgan conceived the Frost-Nixon interviews as a prize fight between two comeback-hungry veterans only one of whom could win. Ever-cheerful Frost (Michael Sheen wide-eyed and so coiffed as to be a distraction) meets sonorous gloomy Nixon (Frank Langella) for the equivalent of the pre-bout weigh-in. The former president is immune to Frosts preternatural perkiness even as he peppers the air with misfired jokes. Chronology is tweaked to give events a sports-match tension. As soon as the cameras roll Frost takes a wild swing--asking why Nixon didnt just destroy the incriminating tapes--and opens himself up to a bludgeoning counterattack.Round 1 ends with Nixon running down the clock as Frost is forced to spend his downtime dashing from sponsor to sponsor trying to line up ads. In Round 2 Frost attempts to ambush Nixon by surprising him with actual atrocity footage of his Cambodian invasion. Nixon ducks this roundhouse and leaves Frost hugging the ropes. Its all pretty lugubrious until the big invented scene when the former president places a drunken call to Frosts hotel room seeking a measure of class solidarity ""Did the snobs look down on you too?""Howard has beefed up the supporting roles--Kevin Bacon plays Nixons aide Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell are Frosts researchers and Rebecca Hall has the decorative role of Frosts mistress. In opening up the play however the movie unavoidably dissipates its power. Having Nixons actual lair the so-called Casa Pacifica as a location is considerably less compelling than the stripped-down onstage set in which Langella and Sheen competed not just with each other but with their giant multiplied video images. (Theres a profound poetic justice in that as historian David Greenberg has argued; Nixon was the first American president preeminently concerned with the construction of his image.)Of course Frost/Nixon does provide a certain bitter pleasure appearing as George W. Bush slips into ignominy. In the seasons current scholarly Nixonalysis Reinventing Richard Nixon Daniel Frick describes Frost/Nixons Broadway audience chuckling as Langella delivered Nixons sound-bite justification for his abuse of power (""When the President does it that means its not illegal"") but reserving true merriment for the follow-up line (""But I realize that no one else shares that view"") as if to acknowledge that the current White House occupant does share Nixons view and had gone him one better.Still Frost/Nixons main attraction is neither its topicality nor its historical value but Langellas re-creation of his Tony-winning performance. Anthony Hopkinss portrayal was even stiffer than the man himself (Nixon 1995) but each in his way Rip Torn (Blind Ambition 1979) and Philip Baker Hall (Secret Honor 1984) were also fabulous Nixons while Dan Hedaya (Dick 1999) made the most of his uncanny resemblance. Langella brings something else to the role He doesnt shake his jowls or attempt Nixons sickly smile. Ice-cold and physically imposing the actor is a naturally menacing presence; his stooped shambling eye-rolling Nixon is like a prehistoric beast at bay. Howard follows Nixons confession (""I brought myself down--I gave them a sword"") with the show-stopping image of the stricken leader absurdly pausing to pet a fans doggy on his way to the limo of oblivion.In this Langella captures something of the 1977 Nixon. As New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis wrote at the time ""The first Frost interview made this dreadful creature seem pathetic."" In his 1970 speech on Cambodia Nixon had warned that America would become ""a pitiful helpless giant."" Langellas performance is the lament of a man who became what he beheld.

By David Denby Michael Sheen and Frank Langella in Ron Howards movie.   Credit Illustration by Steve Brodner In 1969 just after Richard Nixon was elected President he gave a press conference in which he addressed the question of Soviet-American relations. His remarks were an entirely cogent and candid summing up of the state of affairs and among the cadre of Nixon haters of whom even though young I was a veteran the shock was considerable. Some of us had made the mistake of not noticing that Nixon was extremely intelligent. Later on of course during the Watergate crisis Nixons brilliance was overcome by pathologies of various kinds. One of the virtues of ""Frost/Nixon"" Ron Howards adaptation of Peter Morgans hit play is that it brings the intelligence back to the forefront without dispelling the elements of menace and fraudulence that were also part of Nixons temperament. The movie re-creates the circumstances around the famous set of televised interviews that the British talk-show entrepreneur David Frost conducted with Nixon in 1977 three years after he resigned the Presidency. Howard and Morgan have opened up the play to the big-media world of airports hotels limos and anxious telephone calls but the center of the material is still the interviews themselves and what each man hoped to gain from them Nixon (Frank Langella) wanted fresh access to the stage as a statesman; Frost (Michael Sheen) whose career was in decline wanted a chance to be taken seriously as a journalist. The interviews turn into a duel Will Frost get Nixon to break his iron habits of denial? Or will Nixon face down Frost and escape public judgment cheating the American people yet again of an apology a confession of sin? During the preparations and the negotiations we quickly take the measure of Frost--an affable chipper smart but rather shallow showman with plenty of hustle and daring. But Nixon keeps changing; we never do completely understand him. Langella has mastered the rumbling voice with its occasional touch of animal growl. He leans forward as he walks almost apelike as his arms hang down; he gets Nixons heaviness of bearing the awkwardness the grotesque sentimentality and also his power the dangerousness even in retreat. This man notices many things including any eccentricity of dress any hint of weakness in his opponent and hes cagey about offering signs of friendliness--an anecdote a bit of personal advice--that would make Frost falter. Protected and coached by the fierce ex-marine Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) Nixon dominates the early interviews talking at length cutting off tough questions. But then after unleashing the journalist James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) who finds evidence that Nixon knew of the Watergate cover-up well before he claimed Frost sees his chance for victory and gets to work. ""Frost/Nixon"" offers considerable insight into the Nixon mystery without solving it; the movie is fully absorbing and even when Nixon falls into a drunken resentful rage exciting but I cant escape the feeling that it carries about it an aura of momentousness that isnt warranted by the events. Why is it meant to be so important to us whether David Frost revives his career? Frost and Reston did finally goad Nixon into saying that he let the American people down and that he believed that ""when the President does it that means its not illegal"" and they have extracted a considerable amount of copy out of the broadcasts (including two books). But its possible that both journalists and playwright have confused a media coup (and a less important one than that of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein) with a cleansing act that forever chastened the Presidency. It was anything but that after all twenty-four years later George W. Bush and Dick Cheney entered the White House. A good part of Baz Luhrmanns excruciating national epic ""Australia"" is set on an enormous cattle station Faraway Downs in the Northern Territory. The landscape is vast and flat with distant red rock monoliths rising out of the desert. Silence and a steady camera I think could have produced in moviegoers an awe comparable to that which David Lean evoked with ""Lawrence of Arabia."" But Luhrmann imposes his own restlessness on the unyielding terrain. In his previous movie ""Moulin Rouge"" his inability to stage anything clearly was disguised by spasmodic camera movements and abrupt cutting; the fragments were glued together to form a bumpy continuity of sorts. But in ""Australia"" when not much is going on in the big open spaces Luhrmann is lost. His camera sweeps along the ground as if searching for something or more frequently it rises rapidly into the air while gazing downward--the receding ground might have been photographed from the space shuttle as it took off. But once Luhrmann is up in the air where can he go? He can only cut to the ground again. He has created an instant cliche the rise to nowhere. In such moments you can feel the directors frustration; hes like an infant wrestling with a king-size mattress. Its a shame that Fox entrusted Luhrmann with this project because audiences were probably ready for a big-boned realistic movie spectacle. We couldnt rightly expect Leans stern pictorial glory or the vital dramatic imagination of a Fred Zinnemann (""From Here to Eternity""). But at this point we would have gladly settled for the routine competence of a George Roy Hill whose national epic ""Hawaii"" (1966) put up against ""Australia"" is a model of narrative rectitude. Luhrmann is drawn to kitsch as inevitably as a bear to honey. The early scenes of this movie have a ludicrous opera-bouffe boisterousness. Nicole Kidman is Sarah Ashley a rich highborn Englishwoman with clipped diction and jackets that fit as tightly as a toreadors. Its 1939 and she arrives in a huff from England to retrieve her husband who she suspects has been dallying with Aboriginal women on the family-owned cattle station. In Darwin she looks for her lift to the interior in the person of a cattle driver known as the Drover (Hugh Jackman) and finds him engaged in a meaningless bar brawl. (As if Australia werent raw enough Luhrmann is given to scenes of roistering and tumult.) Of course the two take an immediate dislike to each other and of course we know exactly what will happen he will bring out the passionate woman beneath the starched riding clothes (which she wears in the desert heat); shes going to bring out the responsible and caring man within the nihilistic free spirit. Were quickly treated to such delicate moments as a conversation during their drive across the desert in which hes talking about mating two horses and she thinks hes propositioning her and a scene in which she gapes at his naked torso as they make camp for the night. Meanwhile a neighboring cattle baron (Bryan Brown) is trying to destroy Faraway Downs so that he can buy it on the cheap. He has an evil fellow (David Wenham) working for him who has a disconcerting habit of stealthily approaching people and whispering threats into their ears. Here and there Kidman has an enchanting scene such as when she tries to sing ""Over the Rainbow"" to Nullah (Brandon Walters) a half-caste boy who lives at Faraway Downs but cant remember the tune or the lyrics and makes them up as she goes along. As for Jackman he has adapted the Victor Mature approach to pectoral mass but his temperamental range is undeveloped. Mostly he seems like a quiet man who would prefer to be excused from all the overwrought goings on. Luhrmann wants to create huge throbbing set pieces but he never establishes an adequate ground of normal reality from which those pieces would be an exultant relief. The movie is all bitter partings and joyous reunions and nasty Japanese dive-bombers who fly in and mess up everything. None of the big moments look quite right--for example the cattle drive in which the animals are stampeded to the edge of a precipice is obviously a digital fake. The movie joins a 1939 plot to contemporary technology--old Hollywood cheesiness meets new Hollywood cheesiness. In the midst of the spectacle however Luhrmann and his screenwriters Stuart Beattie Ronald Harwood and Richard Flanagan have attempted to denounce racism (Nullah is despised by the whites) and then to trace the beginnings of white respect for Aboriginal culture. Nullahs grandfather a shaman known as King George (David Gulpilil) is a major figure in the movie--well in a way. Whenever the story gets stuck he suddenly appears in a loincloth perched atop a peak or perhaps a water tower--in any case hes up high. He then performs whatever magic is necessary to move the film along. At the end King George summons Nullah to a rite of passage a walkabout. Nullahs disappearance into the desert leaving the whites behind is framed as a triumphant anti-colonial moment but Luhrmann confuses the issue by accompanying the scene with of all things the stirring ""Nimrod"" passage from ""Enigma Variations"" by Edward Elgar the composer perhaps most closely associated with the glories of empire. With the same degree of appropriateness Luhrmann might celebrate Barack Obamas Inauguration with a thundering rendition of ""Dixie.""

Plus Cadillac Records hits its groove. By David Edelstein Published Nov 30 2008 ShareThis (Photo Ralph Nelson/Universal Pictures) Somewhereperhaps in the netherworld rats gnawing on his kidneys awaiting the arrival of his friend HenryRichard Nixon is smiling at the thought of being played by the grave sonorous still-handsome Frank Langella. For all his attempted gravitas Nixon was a shifty-eyed lightweight and transparent phony whereas Langella is a born Shakespearean. Finally Nixon has the stature that eluded him in life In the film of his play Frost/Nixon Peter Morgan elevates the 1977 interviews Nixon gave (or rather sold for an unheard-of 600000) to English TV personality David Frost into a momentous event in the history of politics and media. His conceit is to frame the whole spectacle as a championship boxing match with coaches in each mans corner (Kevin Bacon as Nixon man Jack Brennan Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt as Team Frosts James Reston Jr. and Bob Zelnick). Frost and Nixon have one huge thing in common They each need a showbiz comeback. But Nixons object is to redeem himself (or failing that run out the clock) Frosts is to get Nixon to admit that he was what hed assured the American people he wasnt (and would never thanks to Gerald Ford be convicted of being) a crook. Theres also a Rocky element Will the playboy and gadabout Frost (played by Michael Sheen) cram for the final interview on Watergate and score a knockout or will he let Nixon continue to talk circles around him and win on points? In the theater Frost/Nixon had the trappings of a Big Deal Langellas reverberant presence a sardonic narrator in Reston and a bank of monitors that created a tension between the live performance and its video translation. The film directed rather impersonally by Ron Howard is brisk well crafted and enjoyable enough but the characters seem thinner (Sheen is all frozen smiles and squirms) and the outcome less consequential. As in Morgans screenplays for The Queen and Longford the theme is the collision of venerable authority figures and a modern media that (in their view) cheapens and distorts everything that they stand for. Does the camera trivializeor does it pick up truths the human eye rarely sees as starkly? Did it caricature Nixon who loathed it or penetrate to his crooked soul? Resonant questionsbut at this point why should we care that Frost salvaged a minor TV career by getting the guilty-as-sin Nixon to acknowledge after hours of prodding for which he was exorbitantly compensated that he let the American people down? In terms of its impact on the electorate (and the relations between politicians and the media) the Nixon-Frost interviews have been dwarfed by the meeting of Katie Couric and Sarah Palin in which the interview subject was so surreally deficient that routine follow-ups became gotcha questions. Even Nixon would have been appalled. Frost/Nixon is unsatisfying even if like me youre a lifelong aficionado of Nixon-bashing. Morgan makes him out to be a Great White Whale but when he sat down with Frost Nixon was already dead in the waterconvicted by his own words in White House transcripts to the point where even his Republican allies had long deserted him. And with selective editing Morgan makes it seem as if Frost got Nixon to admit more than he actually did. The original Watergate interview is now on DVD and there are self-exculpatory escape clauses in every interminable circumlocutory utterance. When Frost read aloud from the White House transcripts Nixons eyes darted around as he searched his brain for linguistic loopholes. In Frost/Nixon Langellas heavy features move slowly; he seems to be plumbing the depths of his soul and glimpsing for an instant the abyss. Alas the shit that dribbles from Langellas mouth is still Tricky Dicks. Darnell Martins Cadillac Records tells the story of Chicagos Chess Records and the seminal blues artists it launched among them Muddy Waters Little Walter Howlin Wolf Chuck Berry and Etta James. The film moves swiftly and leaves out details but that barely matters. The ensemble is stupendoushowlingly greatand the music goes deep. The major themes are beautifully worked out. First recorded in Mississippi by folk historian Alan Lomax Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) takes his act on the road and winds up in Chicago in the fifties working with Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) the Polish-Jewish emigre with a fondness for blues and Cadillacswhich he bestows on his successful artists often in lieu of paychecks. Martin handles Chesss possible duplicity (as opposed to spaciness) vaguely but that ends up working for the film As progressive as he is in collaborating with African-Americans Chess acts as if they shouldnt need to worry their little heads about money which they wouldnt know how to handle anyway. As they move from the plantation to the recording studio to segregated and then desegregated halls these artists are at once wildly potenttheir music takes people someplace so goood they want to get nakedand infantilized. They act out in different ways with booze or smack or sex or violence; theyre not yet fully liberated. (There would be many lawsuits to come.) The framing device (the story is told by Cedric the Entertainer as Willie Dixon) isnt fresh and the film isnt everything it should be visually The compositions feel hemmed-in TV-ish instead of sinuous and febrile. But the soundtracka mix of re-creations and originalstakes you places movies rarely go. After a run of bland big-money roles Wright reminds us what an astounding character actor he is. He does the Brando thingpuffed-out cheeks and a thick tongue with a staccato mumble. Columbus Shorts Little Walter comes at you with the showboat fury of Walters harmonica; Eamonn Walkers gravel-voiced Howlin Wolf is lycanthropically inspired; and if Mos Defs Chuck Berry isnt especially Berryish its Mos at his funniest and loopiest. The surprise is Beyonce Knowles who is not the gorgeous self-contained non-actress weve come to know but a plush pincushion who can barely contain her resentment. Cadillac Records could be three times as long and wouldnt spread its miracles too thin. Frost/Nixon Directed by Ron Howard. Universal Pictures. R. Cadillac Records Directed by Darnell Martin.

The surprising news is that ""Frost/Nixon"" works even better on screen. Director Ron Howard and Morgan adapting his own play have both opened up the tale and with the power of close-ups made this duel of wits even more intimate and suspenseful. Howards giddily entertaining sharply observant movie plays like a thriller. ""I shall be your fiercest adversary"" Nixon (Frank Langella) warns Frost (Michael Sheen) before the taping of their first session. ""I shall come after you with everything Ive got. Because the limelight can only shine on one of us."" Nixon the cunning old fox is playing mind games with his interviewer but his words proved truer than he imagined. Frost and his team are out for blood. The aim as the muckraking writer James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell) puts it is ""to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.""Langella and Sheen originated these roles on stage and its impossible to imagine anyone else playing them. Sheen who was Tony Blair in Morgans ""The Queen"" dazzles as the debonair media high-wire artist holding on for dear life when the slippery Nixon ducks all his early-round punches. More presidential than the real president Langella gives Nixon a stature and poignancy that the man himself rarely displayed its a towering witty performance that reaches its peak in the drunken late-night phone call he makes to Frost sizing him up as a man like himself with a fiercely competitive chip on his shoulder. The scene is Morgans invention but its an illuminating inspired fiction. Not everything in ""Frost/Nixon"" happened in real life but both sides would probably agree it should have.

""Frost/Nixon"" is an effective straightforward bigscreen version of Peter Morgans shrewd stage drama about the historic 1977 TV interview in which Richard Nixon brought himself down once again. Like the other election-year release about a modern Republican president ""W."" this one isnt out to ""get"" its much-vilified subject as much as to cast him as something of a tragic victim of his own limitations and foibles -- tragic for the perpetrator and his country alike. Frank Langellas meticulous performance will attract serious filmgoers assuring good biz in upscale markets but luring the under-40 public will pose a significant marketing challenge. Universal release preemed Wednesday night as the opener of the London Film Festival in advance of its Dec. 5 Stateside bow. Re-creating his Tony-winning role Langella doesnt instantaneously convince as the 37th president the moment you first see him in the wake of Nixons resignation in disgrace on Aug. 9 1974 -- the voice seems a bit languorous the mannerisms a tad forced his features a shade Mediterranean. But over the course of the piece the many facets of the performance merge into an impeccably observed characterization of a man whose accomplishments intellect and aggressive use of power never entirely overcame an abiding inferiority complex and propensity for self-sabotage. Morgan who has carved a unique niche for himself penning smart dramas about the private dealings of eminent modern figures (""The Queen"" ""The Deal"" ""The Last King of Scotland"") laid out in his 2006 play the unlikely circumstances surrounding Nixons four-part interview with English TV personality and chatshow host David Frost (Michael Sheen) a breezy entertainer better known for bantering with showbiz stars than for confronting political heavyweights. As with ""The Queen"" one couldnt have suspected there was necessarily a film in this material or even if there were that it could be written with such authority and seeming inside knowledge. In this case the important events unfolded much as they do onscreen The bold and opportunistic Frost then hosting a TV show in Australia put his own money on the line to keep the project alive when all the major networks and most advertisers shied away from the checkbook journalism involved; Swifty Lazar brokered the deal that would bring Nixon a much-needed 600000; the former president saw the epic interview as a means of rehabilitating himself which in turn would lead to a move back East to the corridors of power; and in what was mutually acknowledged to be a duel in which only one man would prevail Nixon almost effortlessly controlled the interview until Frost turned the tables in a desperate last-minute ploy. Although it all pays off in a potent and revelatory final act rife with insights into the psychology and calculations of power players the initial stretch is rather dry and prosaic. Perhaps needlessly adopting a cinematic equivalent of the plays direct-to-audience address Howard ""interviews"" several of the characters witness-style which makes the film feel somewhat choppy half like a documentary at first. Approach also imposes an overly predictable editing style on the whole film one in which the cuts come precisely on the expected beats when a fleet syncopated rhythm would have moved the exposition along with more flair. The film might even have done without the talking heads altogether. Sheen so effective as Tony Blair in both ""The Deal"" and ""The Queen"" excels again as Frost an insouciant ladies man who in many ways was Nixons opposite -- light devil-may-care and sociable rather than dark brooding and awkward. An engaging early scene -- in which Frost traveling with recruited British producer John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen) picks up comely young socialite Caroline Cushing (Rebecca Hall) in a 747s first-class cabin on his way to California to meet Nixon for the first time -- adroitly conveys the gifted gabbers talent for mixing work and pleasure. The only slightly disconcerting aspect of Sheens turn is his appearance; with his longish brushed-back hair sideburns arched eyebrows and occasionally pursed lips he calls to mind Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining."" For her part as coiffed here Hall looks quite like Carly Simon. Widely viewed as a lightweight ill equipped to take on a cagey old pro like Nixon Frost engages two key associates to help strategize for the big event vet journo Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and professional Nixon hater James Reston (Sam Rockwell). Nixon portrayed as leading a lonely isolated life at his seaside villa in San Clemente (key location work was done at the presidents actual house Casa Pacifica) relies for support on a former Marine Col. Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) while wife Pat (Patty McCormack child star of ""The Bad Seed"") putters around in a fog. While the preliminaries could have been served up with a bit more panache the behind-the-scenes details prove more interesting than might have been imagined. Reston especially senses that Frost whos consumed by trying to nail down backing for the 2 million undertaking will fail to put Nixon through ""the trial he never had"" and supply what he feels the American people need -- a conviction. Dramatic intensity increases when the interviews commence at pics midway point. The interviews were taped not at Nixons own abode but at the modest nearby home of a Republican Party supporter. Nixon has his way with Frost through the first three sessions telling long stories reinforcing his presidential stature and digressing when his interlocutor attempts to put him on the spot. The interview excerpts are obviously the real thing and have been staged with great attention to how they actually looked. Where the script really shines is in the incidental backstage conversation especially how Nixon smalltalks with Frost and catches him off-guard with remarks about the hosts presumed sex life and habits. These private exchanges culminate in the works most compelling sequence in which an inebriated Nixon prior to the final interview phones Frost with a late-night ramble stressing their perceived similarities as fellows from modest circumstances looked down upon by ""the snobs."" By the final scenes Langella has all but disappeared so as to deliver Nixon himself leading to a melancholy ending defined as predicted by the triumph of one man and the virtual vanquishing of the other. Playing real-life participants some better known than others supporting players are uniformly effective. A host of locations including the very suite at the Beverly Hilton where Frost stayed heighten the verisimilitude although production designer Michael Corenblith his staff and costume designer Daniel Orlandi have advisedly soft-pedaled the mid-70s accoutrements so as not to distract too much from serious matters at hand. Hans Zimmers background score provides some extra zing while the R rating earned no doubt by a number of vulgarities is unfortunate as it will further limit the number of younger people who might see the film.
