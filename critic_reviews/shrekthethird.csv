Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures Buff but boring Shreks jolly green ogre seems a little too polished in his third outing. Paramount Pictures Director Chris MillerCo-director Raman HuiGenre ComedyRunning Time 92 minutes Third times the charm for the jolly green ogre -- but only in the ""charm school"" sense alas. Shreks searching for a new king to rule the kingdom of Far Far Away in this installment but hes been so domesticated that hes not much of an ogre anymore. Hes sensitive thoughtful a father-in-training -- and waaaay too cuddly. Donkeys been nipping at the treacle too; he might as well be Eeyores cousin. Of course with Shrek 2 nearly doubling the first films box-office take (and merchandising adding billions to the bottom line) no ones going to stop making Shrek flicks just because the inspirations faded. With a TV special on the way (Shrek the Halls) as well as a Broadway tuner (Shrek The Musical) resistance is probably futile for anyone with kids or grandkids. But apart from some modestly amusing princess shtick and a pleasantly slapsticky opening theres no real reason for anyone over the age of 11 to see this one.

A few days later with far less fanfare ""Paprika"" the work of Japanese anime master Satoshi Kon will also be unveiled. It happens to be one of the most wildly (and disturbingly) inventive animated films Ive seen but will anyone notice? Unlike ""Shrek"" its not conceived as fun for the whole family. ""Paprika"" is made for grown-ups.Great animated movies of course obliterate the distinction between adult and kids movies think of Pixars brilliant ""Toy Story"" movies Miyazakis peerless ""Spirited Away"" the ""Wallace and Gromit"" shorts or the sassy and ebullient first ""Shrek""--all of them marketed to kids but only adults can savor them on all levels. Yet in this country we think of animation only as childs play. Is it because cartoons colonized our little minds when we were kids and so will always be consigned to a realm whose deities are named Mickey and SpongeBob? Is it because we consider the fantastical to be less ""mature"" than realism? Is it simply because there is more profit in movies that reach the widest demographic? Whatever the reason to find an animated feature that isnt ""family entertainment"" you have to go outside the mainstream to Richard Linklaters experiments in morphing live actors into animated figures in ""Waking Life"" and ""A Scanner Darkly."" Neither made a dime no doubt confirming Hollywoods bias against breaking the animation mold.Theres no reason the imaginative freedom that animation allows shouldnt be unleashed on adult themes especially when graphic novels have entered the literary mainstream and when CGI has blurred the line between live action and animation in films like ""300."" Outside the United States animators are not so likely to be confined to the ghetto of kiddie movies. Think of the marvelously macabre French hand-drawn gem ""The Triplets of Belleville"" or the work of the Czech director Jan Svankmajer (""Alice"" ""Faust""). Or most conspicuously Japanese anime which is as likely to be made for 30-year-olds as for tots. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week These questions ran through my mind as I watched the new ""Shrek"" and ""Paprika."" ""Shrek the Third"" is like the first two relentlessly clever and inventive. It had me laughing at the get-go when the obnoxious villain Prince Charming is seen re-enacting his mythic deeds to the jeers of a dinner-theater audience. But its slightly snarky wit (banner in a medieval high school JUST SAY NAY) is aimed almost entirely at parents and it wears out its welcome. Where the first ""Shrek"" left me elated this one never touched my heart or got under my skin. Its a movie at war with itself a kiddie movie that doesnt really want to be one. Why would little ones identify with Shreks new panic about impending fatherhood? This is a very skillfully made corporate product but I wonder who exactly will be fully satisfied.The stunning sci-fi mind-bender ""Paprika"" on the other hand is far too unsettling and dense for children (and may prove too challenging for some adults too). Kon who made the one-of-a-kind ""Millennium Actress"" and ""Tokyo Godfathers"" may be the most exciting Japanese animator since Miyazaki. ""Paprika"" is part detective story part thriller part surrealist fantasia and a meditation on how we live out our subconscious lives through dreams the Internet and movies themselves. The plot centers on a machine that allows psychotherapists to enter and alter the dreams of their patients. But when a prototype of this new invention called the DC Mini is stolen havoc ensues dreams collide and overtake the dreamer; the barrier between reality and nightmare is torn.""Paprika"" takes its name from the ""dream detective"" who is the alter ego of the research psychotherapist Dr. Atsuko Chiba. Shes the shrinks emissary into her patients unconscious and now she must voyage into the unknown to discover who stole the DC Mini and to save the world from going mad. ""Paprika"" is so packed with ideas and visual fireworks it requires more than one viewing. It expands your notion of what animation can achieve. You wake from it as if from a dream spooked provoked and exhilarated.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The trouble with this third instalment though is that a) its Arthurian premise is dispiritingly conventional and b) the pop culture references are starting to wear thin. Shrek the Third centres on hammy wannabe actor Prince Charming (voice of Rupert Everett) who it turns out isnt that charming after all. In fact hes a spoiled egomaniac who loves himself more than his heckling audiences do. When Charmless finds out that the dying King Harold (John Cleese) has asked his ogre of a son-in-law Shrek to seek out his natural successor (a distant nephew called Arthur Pendragon) he seizes the opportunity to organise an ego-boosting coup against the meek civilians of Far Far Away. With Shrek (Mike Myers) and his wise-cracking sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy) away in search of the new king its left to the loveable ogres beloved wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and her bevy of fairytale femme fatales to kick a few butts into touch. But thats not all theres a sub-plot boiling away in Shreks mind and it involves babies...Despite a number of protracted moments a few scenes are truly inspired the dying-frog sequence for one and Shreks Exorcist-inspired nightmare about parenthood for another. Some jokes sail close to innuendo but in the main theyre balanced enough to appeal to all ages. The CG animation too is as refined as weve come to expect. Just a shame it lacks the smart sassiness of its predecessors. Time to call time we think.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Roach Motel William Friedkins Bug is a creepy-crawly drama of the highest order (thanks in large part to Ashley Judd). _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Anthony Friedkin/Courtesy of Lionsgate Entertainment) Bug directed by William Friedkin from Tracy Lettss play has the feverish compression of live theater and the moody expansiveness of film. The mix is insanely powerful. Letts also an actor is a member of Chicagos Steppenwolf Theatre by way of Oklahoma. He has a gift for bumping realism into surrealism with a well-placed nudge for writing dialogue that drives his actors into each others faces (if not each others souls) and for picking up and distilling eerie signals from the heartlandanxieties that blossom into conspiracy theories conspiracy theories that explode into delusions. The path toward conflagration is absurd and inexorable. The movie centers on a folie a deuxyet one that at first doesnt seem so folle. Its two lonely misfits building a sanctuary. Ashley Judd plays Agnes White a forlorn rather dissolute divorcee who lives in a rustic Oklahoma motel (called evocatively Rustic Motel). Her phone rings night and day but no one speaks. Are the calls from her ex newly out on parole? Do they have something to do with a helicopter that circles the motel? Unnerving stuff especially the way Friedkin and his sound designer Steve Boeddeker move the noises from speaker to speaker. By and by her lesbian friend (Lynn Collins) brings over a soft-spoken lunk named Peter Evans (Michael Shannon) for booze and blow. Im not an ax murderer he announces twice when he hears the women speculating on his origins. He does however leave the door open for other possibilities. BACKSTORY Bug screenwriter-playwright Tracy Letts a member of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company since 2002 and Pulitzer finalist for his 2003 play Man From Nebraska has been fascinated by psychodrama since childhood. When asked to share a story about grade school he told Steppenwolfs Backstage publication We had to make a little book and my book was called The Psychopath. The cover of the book showed a man who had hung himself and shot himself in the heada little detective story. A lot of teachers would have seen that and alerted social services. Yet my first-grade teacher Mrs. Parker gave me an A++ saying it was very creative At first Friedkin keeps Agnes and Peter in separate boxes in her dingy motel efficiency but watch how theyre drawn together first by the appearance of her gaudily abusive ex (Harry Connick Jr.) then by those noisesa banging air conditioner a beeping smoke alarm the chop of helicopter blades. No wonder Agnes likes having a man around. When Peter delivers a quiet rant about the omnipresent mind-altering hum of machines she calls it crazy shit then adds that she likes the way he talks. When he points out a bugan aphid of which he has prodigious knowledgeon his pillow she cant see a thing and then maybe wait yes maybe she can. Slowly this nondescript motel room becomes a forest of flypaper strips and a thicket of psychosesand what began as kitchen-sink naturalism becomes well crazy shit. Whats at the root of the infestation? Iraq chemical weapons Tuskegee AIDS research It all goes into Lettss cauldron of blood. I wish Id been able to giggle at Bug for being so over-the-top. But line by line beat by beat its gripping stuff and Friedkin puts you right in the middle of the melee. How did the coldly detached director of The French Connection The Exorcist and To Live and Die in L.A. manage to get inside this playpreserving its theatricality yet making it such a live-wire experience? The actors contribute much. Michael Shannon (the intransigently patriotic ex-Marine in World Trade Center) played Peter onstage for years and his sunken demeanorhis lack of spontaneitygives him a Golem-like poignancy. But Bug belongs to Judd maybe the most unsung great actress in American movies. She has made herself look convincingly dissipatedpuffy baggy-eyed almost used-up yet still very very beautiful. No matter how heightened the dialogue there isnt a line that doesnt sound as if its coming out of her head. Her Agnes is clearly projecting like mad onto her new lovereven welcoming the dementia that envelops her. Watching Judd I didnt only think of women in abusive relationships but of Abu Ghraib poster girl Lynndie England a not-too-bright small-town girl who got sucked into her controlling boyfriends universewho eagerly posed for her man the way so many young women do becoming a character in someone elses sick fantasy. Incidentally some of the posters for Bug depict Judd as a kind of Star Trek Borg Queen and scream Horror movie The distributor Lionsgate is the best in the business at promoting films like Saw and the campaign might workin the short term. But I guarantee you that 99 percent of those who go to Bug thinking theyre in for good gooey fun with the babe from Kiss the Girls are going to riot in the aisles. Youll hear a lot about a momentous and magical overhead shot in Emanuele Crialeses Golden Door. Hundreds of Sicilians assemble on the deck of a ship sailing for America while hundreds of their countrymen (and family members) stand on the other side of the railing. From above they are one group one people covering the screen from corner to corner in their dark coats and hatsand then with a deep rumble the ship begins to pull away an ocean opening between them. Whats disorienting is that the camera stays with the ship so its the people on land who appear to be sailing away. And in a sense they are into history. 1 2 Next Share this story...

By David Denby Hollywood in-jokes still proliferate in the latest movie to star the green ogre.   Credit PABLO LOBATO At a recent preview screening of ""Shrek the Third"" I was settling into my seat enjoying the good sight lines (nothing but pipsqueaks between me and the screen) and the excited anticipation of the children when a little voice behind me said ""Have to turn off my cell phone now."" The child a girl couldnt have been more than seven. Was she kidding? Alas she wasnt. Even in this culture seven is too early for irony. Then as the movie began I realized that a child with a cell phone represents what DreamWorks Animation the producer of this most lucrative of franchise animated features envisions its audience to be--tiny pre-corporate techies who live far from the fairy-tale emotion of enchantment. ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and the ""Harry Potter"" series have discovered their own kind of wonder but the gang at DreamWorks assumes that its audience lives in an unillusioned media world. But theres a mystery here. Did the girls parents read to her from the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen? Has she seen ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" or any of the other drippy-beautiful Disney animated features with their butterflies and wondrous glades and shimmering harp glissandos? DreamWorks must assume that she has and has no tender feelings for them because the ""Shrek"" movies are filled with parodies of the old honeyed Disney style. The parents may get more of the jokes than the children do but the kids are being fed non-stop satirical hobbledehoydom in which past and present Gothic dungeons and Valley Girl talk are all jumbled together. The ""Shrek"" phenomenon is one of those seeming oddities in our culture--children being entertained with derision before theyve been ravished by awe. Maybe seven isnt too early for irony after all. ""Shrek"" is postmodernism for towheads pastiche for the potty-trained. Once upon a time the most wonderful of all childrens authors William Steig brought out at the age of eighty-three a book that became the book in many families including mine where the boys relished its snarly splendor. ""Shrek"" published in 1990 is about a creature--warty lousy gap-toothed noisome and green--who is utterly self-confident. Shrek is so blind to beauty that hes invulnerable. Nothing scares him except his sweaty bad dream of being loved by children but he scares everyone else. He has magical powers--his noxious fumes which cause flowers and dragons to wilt. For all its acrid temper ""Shrek"" was very much a charmed fairy tale the perfectly ugly creature finds his perfectly ugly mate. ""And they lived horribly ever after."" The Shrek that DreamWorks designed is a much more benign figure. He is smooth rather than lumpy ugly-cute rather than ugly-scary. (His beloved named Princess Fiona in the movies is ugly-cute too. She looks like Miss Piggy.) Shrek lost the knob on the top of his head which now narrows above the eyes giving him a look of permanent anxiety. In the first movie which came out in 2001 Mike Myers as the voice of Shrek gave him a foul temper. Shrek didnt want to play the hero; he just wanted to regain exclusive title to his beloved swamp where in a dastardly resettlement scheme the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) had dumped all the disused fairy-tale creatures from old Disney movies. Shrek set out to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon as part of a real-estate deal with Farquaad in which he would get back his muddy front yard in return for the girl. But when Fiona turned out to really be as ugly as Shrek he found a wife. In ""Shrek 2"" (2004) Shrek and Fiona happily ogred pass up the temptations of beauty and retain their natural dark-lime hue. The message of the first two movies was that you have to be yourself an idea that came off in this context as the kind of mass-marketed individualism that induces teen-agers to buy cutoff jeans. It was very different from Steigs mood of defiant self-sufficiency. Its not a big surprise that the material was unnecessarily softened or that DreamWorks dropped Steigs merry Yiddishkeit. (In the book Shrek runs into a witch chanting ""Otchky-potchky"" which sounds like a street game Steig might have learned growing up in the Bronx.) What was put in place of Steigs special flavor was the acidity of corporate competition--DreamWorks rivalry with Disney for the animation market. As many people pointed out at the time the figure of Farquaad who was stumpy and egotistical may have been a swipe at Michael Eisner who was then Disneys chairman and the former boss of Jeffrey Katzenberg a DreamWorks partner. And the movies strategy of teasing old Disney characters may have derived in part from a dispute going back to 1994 when Katzenberg left Disney and Eisner refused to pay the hundreds of millions of dollars he felt were due him. The ""Shrek"" movies are funny but the wised-up style of the comedy--the Hollywood put-ons and inside gags--has sour roots and after a while the industry jokiness becomes a little nauseating. In ""Shrek the Third"" which was directed by Chris Miller Fionas father the frog king is dying and he tells Shrek (Myers) that he must now be ruler of Far Far Away the land in which they all live. Since this is the last thing Shrek wants he goes on a quest for a substitute--Fionas cousin Arthur (Justin Timberlake) known as Artie who is a student at Worcestershire Academy a kind of medieval Burbank High in which snarky kids in jerkins smoke frankincense and myrrh. The plot material isnt as strong as in the first two movies--if anything it feels a bit desperate--but the anti-Disney joke blunderbuss remains in good working order the movie takes several shots at Disneys recent forays into melodious Broadway kitsch. Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas who sparked ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"" as respectively Donkey and Puss in Boots are used less centrally than before but Rupert Everett so snide that he has become uncastable as anything but a voice is quite splendid as the arch-loser Prince Charming. Everett is in touch with the spirit though perhaps not the body of William Steigs incomparable creation. The characters in the ""Shrek"" series may resemble rubber bathtub toys but DreamWorks computer-generated imagery with its three-dimensional look gives them shadows and weight as they fling themselves hither and yon into distant castle-strewn perspectives. By contrast the brilliant ""Paprika"" directed by Satoshi Kon--a masterly example of Japanese anime intended for adults--is partly hand drawn and features multiple areas of visual activity layered at different distances from the picture plane. Set in a business world of long white corridors and glass walls and research labs its a Freudian-Jungian-Felliniesque sci-fi thriller and an outright challenge to American viewers who may in the face of its whirligig complexity feel almost pea-brained. Paprika the heroine is an eighteen-year-old sprite--a kind of sexy Japanese Tinker Bell--who enters peoples dreams as a form of therapy. She explains to one of her patients a detective haunted by a murder he was unable to prevent that the first dreams we have when we fall asleep are like arty short films and longer dreams are like blockbusters. In ""Paprika"" this connection between dreams and movies is worked to a fare-thee-well but there are other levels of representation too--Internet sites which characters enter bodily and appearing now and then a kind of collective unconscious in which a parade of toys and icons (including the Statue of Liberty) march through an enormous city with a menacing throbbing insistence that borders on the fascistic. All of Japanese pop is there. For Japanese traditionalists the parade must be a true nightmare. Paprika it turns out has a Clark Kent-like double Dr. Chiba a beautiful research scientist who works at a company that has developed a machine--the DC-MINI--that also enters dreams. Human beings it seems will go mad if they dont dream but ""Paprika"" is about people whose dreams have been maddened one of the DC-MINI prototypes has been copped by an evil genius who wants to possess everyones inner life and is mucking around with the sleep of Chibas colleagues. As Paprika and Chiba enter the dreams--which are fleshed out with familiar images that become increasingly threatening--they undergo wild adventures terrifying violent and sometimes sexual. ""Paprika"" asks ""Who shall control our dreams?"" which given this films take on the cinematic nature of the unconscious is really asking ""Who shall control the movies?"" Paprikas detective friend also feels guilty because he once betrayed a fellow-student who was a filmmaker. When he saves Paprika from death and she in turn cures him of his guilt he is free for the first time in years to go to the movies. After some of the most outrageous leaps ever conjoined in a single film ""Paprika"" comes to rest with the simple act of a man buying a ticket. Amen.

"Shreks Funny Yet Third Times Not So Charming washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Shreks Funny Yet Third Times Not So Charming Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Shrek (Mike Myers) in the Far Far Away land of sometimes witty dialogue and super-duper flames and water. (Dreamworks Animation Llc) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 18 2007 ""Shrek the Third"" manages to be something of a paradox It contains two theoretically self-canceling polarities. Its (a) quite funny and (b) quite bad. Hmm possibly thats actually harder to pull off than to make a movie thats (a) funny and (b) good or (a) unfunny and (b) bad. But the end result is that you laugh a lot and you go home grumpy. The DreamWorks animators all 600 of them or whatever have by this time total technical control of the universe theyve engineered at least down to the cellular level (the faces still look somewhat waxy and the hair somewhat polyurethane). Theyve created a great range of motions and their weirdly real-unreal populace is able to dance fence leap lurch fall and wiggle with amazing verisimilitude that somewhat overcomes the dead lines of the computer-designed architecture in the background. And boy can they do water and flame well. Their flames lick and hiss and undulate in rapturous hunger eerily insubstantial; the water you can feel with its tranquil yet subtly modulating surface capturing not only fluency but a billion pixels of light to throw off at the camera lens -- that is if there is a camera lens and come to think of it there probably isnt anymore. But the point is you totally believe in the artifice that is before your eyes. And you know what? Big deal. Thats not news. Who cares? What have you done for me lately? That was the big story of 1999. The big story of 2007 is that the humor is all in the business and nowhere in the lame story. The movie attempts to keep two subplots cutting from one to the other for heightened dramatic effect. But neither is compelling individually so the cross-cutting rhythms never capture you. It becomes a dreary ""And then . . . "" sort of storytelling without any real suspense risk or drama. In the first subplot Shrek (the voice of Michael Myers sometimes with a Scottish burr sometimes without) becomes king upon the death of the frog king of Far Far Away as this mythical land actually a subtext of Hollywood is called. And guess what? He doesnt like it. Hed rather be in his stinky swamp luxuriating in solitude mud and trouble-free sex with his wife the Princess Fiona a gal who used to look like Cameron Diaz (she still does the voice) but now looks like Shrek who frankly aint that eye-appealing. Anyway in the movies best few minutes a kind of a mise-en-scene that the 40s studio directors could bring off beautifully but is now a totally lost art we shunt through several sequences in which Shreks hugeness strangeness clumsiness and strength utterly betray him in the delicate requirements of court etiquette and like a great comedian from the 10s and 20s he destroys every event or object that comes his way. Hes Stan and Ollie in one large green being. Confessing his ineptitude and unhappiness he goes off in search of a kid named Arthur who is the real heir to the throne. Meanwhile the disgruntled Prince Charming reduced to dinner theater is plotting a coup to take over the kingdom. So for a while the movie cuts between Shreks adventures at a parody of Beverly Hills High and the revolutionary politics of Far Far Away which culminate in a very strange airborne invasion by which Fiona and her court (all fairy tale princesses played by comedian-hipsters Amy Sedaris Maya Rudolph Amy Poehler Cheri Oteri and um Larry King) are captured and imprisoned. Shrek and the new boy king -- Justin Timberlake for crying out loud -- return and run a counter-coup which climaxes in (this is where it gets a little weird) a huge musical comedy number. And heres the ridiculous part It plays even dumber than it sounds. Still now and then the wit of the dialogue sparkles and the ironic use of rock music at key moments is clever. And continually pleasing is the sense of ironic play that informs the whole thing the way it keeps lurching into parodies that most kids will miss the way like ""Saturday Night Live"" it plays over and over again on cliches of showbiz we all know and recognize. Then again I like the idea of the ""SNL"" pretties playing the court princesses in the style of languid modern New Yorky gals unexcitable neurotic and wretchedly competitive. A Shrek dream in which the world is overrun by baby Shreks (also a movie critics nightmare) is quite funny. But do Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas add much? Possibly the fact that they dont appear in this review until paragraph 13 gives you an idea. I think Ive used this line before but Im going to use it again because if you care enough to steal steal the very best. So I give you from some diary of Ned Rorem I liked everything about it except it. Shrek the Third (92 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild sexual innuendo crude humor and mild action sequences.

A handsome young street musician in Dublin raises his voice in song then raises it higher with heart-stopping fervor. When a mysteriously endearing young woman stops to interrogate the busker about his music -- she turns out to be a musician too -- the movie reveals itself as something magical. When they sing their first duet its a song of such transporting passion that you wonder where the drama can possibly go since theyre obviously made for each other and should instantly leave the screen to live the rest of their lives in private bliss. The lovers are played by Glen Hansard the lead singer of the Irish rock group The Frames and Marketa Irglova a musician from the Czech Republic. (Amazingly given her gifts as a singer pianist and actress Ms. Irglova was only 17 years old when the movie was shot.) Both performances give new meaning to the timeworn phrase ""pitch-perfect"" while both characters do nicely without names; theyre listed in the credits only as the Guy and the Girl. Coy appellations of this sort often serve as warning labels for faux-simple fables that are fatuous or downright cloying but thats hardly the case here. ""Once"" proves to be as smart and funny as it is sweet; it swirls with ambiguity and conflict beneath a simple surface. In all of 88 minutes Mr. Carneys singular fable follows its guy and girl through a week of musical and emotional growth that could suffice for a lifetime. ENLARGE Music is intrinsic to the filmmakers plan. The love story can be seen -- and felt and heard -- as a succession of chord changes and the exquisite resolution amounts to a mutual musical offering. At a time when movie musicals have come to be synonymous with emotional and visual extravagance -- the super-mega-over-the-topness of ""Chicago"" or ""Dreamgirls"" -- Mr. Carney has dared to take everything down to its essence. Whats left is two intensely likable people trying urgently through very few words and a bakers dozen of eloquent songs to come to terms with love theyve lost and collaborate on the future. As Guys go this one seems like the answer to a Girls prayer. He sings like an angel -- a loud angel whos no stranger to anger. He summons sumptuous sounds from his battered guitar and writes brilliant songs when he isnt fixing Hoover vacuums in his fathers Dickensian shop. As Girls go this one is irresistible from the first moment she opens her mouth When was the last time you couldnt wait to find out what a movie character was all about? Shes got spunk to spare speaks with a slightly extra-terrestrial accent sings with no accent at all writes her own powerful songs and miracle of miracles has a Hoover that needs repair. (In one of the many memorable sequences in the film which was shot by Tim Fleming she trails her ailing vacuum cleaner like a blue dog on a hose as she and her Guy stroll through Dublins streets.) In 1991 the year that Glen Hansard started The Frames he also played Outspan the baby-faced Dublin guitar player in ""The Commitments"" a feature that has gained a global following. (Its one of my favorite films ever.) What makes ""The Commitments"" so widely loved is among other pleasures its use of a working-class rock bands rise and fall as an armature for individual drama. ""Once"" may earn the same special status by doing something similar albeit on a more intimate scale -- using pop-rock songs to shape its characters ecstatic feelings. And very much like ""The Commitments"" this remarkable new Irish film grounds its Guy and Girl in the rock-solid specifics of musicianship. When she plays Mendelssohn on a piano in a music store he listens with enchanted intensity. When they finally get to singing lyrics she has written to his melody the sense of their intimacy transcends physicality. (Its worth noting that the story neither needs nor bothers with conventional sexual interludes.) My own feeling is that I should say something negative here; how else will anyone trust all this praise? In fact the film presents inevitable language problems -- not bad language of which there is more than a soupcon but the authentic and sometimes impenetrable language of a guy from Ireland and a girl from Moravia who dont speak in mid-Atlantic tones. Another problem could be more substantial or may have been confined to the projection at my screening where the audio quality of some of the music tracks left a lot to be desired. Enough of that though. The title of one of those tracks is ""You Must Have Fallen From the Sky."" Thats the way I came to feel about ""Once."" Shrek the Third ENLARGE Being Green The computer-animated ogre returns for another outing in Shrek the Third. We live in a world of wonders. According to the production notes for ""Shrek the Third"" the animation artists used HP DLI45 ProLiant servers and HP xw9300 workstations powered by AMD Operton processors. So whats the result? A parallel world of wonders zestfully conceived and radiantly rendered in which the great-hearted ogre tries his likeable best to avoid the parallel threats of kingship and parenthood. This latest iteration of DreamWorkss money machine has its ups and downs its longueurs along with its felicities plus an abiding preoccupation with poop. In the proper context though -- a profusion of feature animation thats second-rate or worse -- ""Shreks"" return is a signal event and the signal of course shines green. The issue of reigning over the kingdom of Far Far Away is raised by the death of Fionas froggy father King Harold (who voiced by John Cleese gives a hilariously rambling death-bed speech.) Shrek is the logical successor to the throne but terrified by the responsibility he sails off to find an acceptable substitute in Fionas cousin Artie (Justin Timberlake) a student at Medieval High where Hogwarts meets the San Fernando Valley. Eddie Murphys Donkey and Antonio Banderass Puss are back too although Donkeys role has lost its bite without losing its whinny; for a while it sounded as if someone was impersonating Mr. Murphy. Among the new arrivals are Eric Idles Merlin who puts on an impressive magic show and despite Shreks worst fears and best efforts at denial a houseful of cute little baby ogres who draw -- not only thanks to the wonders of computers -- from vast reservoirs of spit-up.    DVD TIP ""Brassed Off"" (1996) is a fantasy with music set in working-class Yorkshire during the Thatcher era when the government was closing coal pits throughout Britain. In one grimy town a colliery brass band struggles on in the quixotic belief that its survival will save the local mine and the towns livelihood. The cast includes Ewan McGregor Pete Postlethwaite and Tara Fitzgerald as the glorious Gloria who plays flugelhorn.

"Shrek the Third Better than expected | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesShrek the Third Better than expectedWhile its not quite the equal of its predecessors Shrek the Third beats the third-film curse with a laid-back familiarity and the occasional surprise.By Rob SalemTelevision CriticFri. May 18 2007 (out of 4)With the voices of Mike Myers Cameron Diaz Eddie Murphy. Directed by Chris Miller Raman Hui. 93 minutes. At major theatres. PG  ""Third times the charm.""Whoever coined that particular phrase hasnt seen a lot of movie sequels. Godfather III Lethal Weapon 3 Jaws 3-D Alien 3 Matrix Revolutions the third X-Men movie Box-office numbers to the contrary no one seems particularly thrilled with the recent Spider-Man 3 and the naysayers are not exactly yo-ho-ho-ing at the prospect next week of a longer and even more convoluted third Pirates of the Caribbean.What then to expect of Shrek the Third a movie perhaps even more transparently than most made primarily to sustain and bolster a lucrative tent-pole merchandising franchise - already set to continue at the end of this year with an ABC TV Christmas special Shrek the Halls and a fourth suggested movie sequel in the early planning stages?Article Continued BelowNot very much beyond the usual slew of character-generated commercialism aimed at the very young.But thats the thing about expectations. You just never know when something is going to exceed them.As it turns out Shrek the Third is just fine - if at that the least of the series the bar in this case set particularly high. What the characters and satirical situations may lack this time out in a certain fresh vitality they more than compensate for with a warm laid-back familiarity ... and the occasional out-of-left-fjord surprise.The third time in this case really is the charm or rather the Charming as Rupert Everetts foppish suitor prince from Shrek II now finds himself sadly relegated to dinner-theatre derring-do fighting a clumsily costumed pseudo-Shrek atop a wooden hobby horse two shows a night with a weekend matinee. Roused to revenge he rallies the disenfranchised villains of Far Far Away in a co-ordinated attack on ... ah but that would be telling.Meanwhile back at the castle the frog king (returning ex-Python John Cleese) who is about to croak names Shrek as his successor. And as you can already tell from the commercials Shrek proves to be something less than monarch material. His only recourse is to go and fetch the abandoned royal nephew Artie Pendragon (Justin Timberlake) back from high-school bully hell to replace him on the throne.Seems the put-upon lad is need of a mentor his favourite teacher Merlin (a second ex-Python Eric Idle) having been reduced to a crystal-clutching psycho-babbling Birkenstock-clad loon in shrunken wizard-wear that barely keeps his essentials covered.Arties father issues could not come at a more convenient time for Shrek since back at home Fiona is ... well again youve seen the commercials. As the above plot lines indicate Shrek the Third is somewhat slightly less silly and a bit more grown-up than its predecessors. Not that the kids wont love it just as much (and watch the eventual DVD over and over and over and over again). Lets face it there has always been a substantial element of parentally intended adult humour in of these movies which the kids with any luck are not going to get until well after theyve reach puberty. If then. References to Hooters and Kill Bill are one thing - and the Uma-tization of the formerly helpless fairy-tale princesses (voiced by Amy Sedaris and SNL actresses Maya Rudolph Cheri Oteri and Amy Poehler) is at the same time the movies singular adult-reference set piece and a laudable message of empowerment for little girls. But a Jeff Spicoli Fast Times at Ridgemont High sight gag? Thats one for grandma and grandpa.On the other hand when the poor little Gingerbread Man gets so freaked out he accidentally poops out a Jelly Tot ... well theres a dirty joke that can be enjoyed by the entire family.I do have one quibble - though to anyone else the filmmakers in particular this could only be perceived as a plus The computer animation is better than ever. I mean really. I dont know if its the pixel count or the rendering algorithms or something new the animators have been smoking but the ""realism"" of the characters and environments is quite strikingly more vivid than in either of the first films.Particularly the characters and their facial expressions. Which means more close-ups. A lot more. Very close-up. Enough to count Shreks nose hairs and detect the 5 oclock stubble on Charmings otherwise immaculate face.Which makes the characters seem that much more human. Even the ones who arent human at all - which in Shreks case amounts to a rather unfortunate and uncanny resemblance to retiring HBO gangster Tony Soprano. Only green and if possible even more bloated - as if left out unrefrigerated well past his due date.Which for me only helped to underscore the movies endless running gag about how bad Shrek smells.

Photo DreamWorks Animation Shrek the Third 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Never question the power of cinema to open our eyes and expand our worlds. To rattle prejudices; to challenge assumptions; to realize yo check it out donkeys and dragons can get it on. And the tufted fellows they produce are actually pretty cute. I discovered this and more from Shrek the Third one of the more instructive sequels to come down the pike. Beyond the business of cross-species compatibility I learned that 1. Shrek has morning breath. 2. He sleeps in the nude. 3. Merlin the Magician wears Birkenstocks with tube socks the old coot. He also sports a robe that ""doesnt quite cover his"" whatever. Note PG rating. 4. Arthur the legendary savior of Britannia is a pug-nosed teenage nerd who goes by Artie and embraces his royal lineage at a pep rally (""Just Say Nay""). More shocking hes voiced by Justin Timberlake in the finest performance of his career. 5. Julie Andrews (or her computer-generated avatar Queen Lillian) can head-butt her way through castle walls. 6. Recalling his life in flashbacks the Ginger Bread Man makes Slinky noises like the Six Million Dollar Man. Which means that the tiny persecuted biscuit is ... bionic? 7. Bad guys have feelings too Captain Hook (Ian McShane) grows daffodils and the Headless Horseman plays the flute. With what I dont know. This last point is key because Shrek the Third is the first Shrek to suggest with modish Freudian revisionism that some of these villains might have been handed a raw deal by the good guys. Someone at DreamWorks has been reading Gregory Maguire novels in his spare time -- maybe director Chris Miller co-director Raman Hui or some random Wicked fan on that committee of screenwriters. Either way the emphasis on psychic wounds makes for a fuzzy-wuzzy Shrek the kindest and gentlest in the trilogy and the only one to include the line ""Each of you is standing in your own way"" The derivative psychobabble is (Im figuring) meant as a parody in a franchise thats known to spoof every available paradigm. Much of it is familiar on this third go-round but much of it isnt and the movies tidy running time is crammed with so many yuks that Id have to watch two or three times to catch them all. And I wouldnt mind. Not that the plot matters but here goes Green guy Shrek (the voice of Mike Myers) and wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are temporarily ruling the land of Far Far Away when Fionas frog-king daddy-o (John Cleese) croaks and I mean fatally to considerable comic effect. Shrek goes ballistic at the idea of assuming kingly duties on a permanent basis and runs off with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) in search of an alternate heir. This means Artie. As you might expect that vain hambone Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) also aspires to the throne and leading a band of frustrated baddies he lays siege to the castle on a quest for his own Happily Ever After. Snow White (Amy Poehler) Cinderella (Amy Sedaris) Sleeping Beauty (Cheri Oteri) Queen Lillian and ugly stepsister Doris (Larry King) join Fiona in the fight against the invading forces. Commence grrrl-power bonding sequence set to Heart. Meanwhile the denizens of fairyland are faced with this startling revelation 8. Rapunzel wears hair extensions.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""The ogre achiever"" as a billboard campaign dubs Shrek has finally won over this doubter. Sure Eddie Murphys Donkey has been kick- - ahem - donkey from the get-go. In ""Shrek 2"" Antonio Banderas Puss in Boots had us at ""meow."" The three pigs Pinocchio the bonnet-wearing Wolf and the Gingerbread Man remain faves. But Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) and his beloved Fiona (Cameron Diaz) were never the draw so much as the excuse for this moviegoer to enter DreamWorks pun-loaded fairy-tale- tweaking funhouse. In this third outing synthetic as a can of soda pop and just as effervescent Shrek is less petulant. Theres charm in his ambivalence-tinged maturing. Far Far Aways King (John Cleese) is in dire need of an heir and looks to his son-in-law. Heaping even more responsibility onto Shreks sloped green shoulders Fiona is pregnant. Such is the set-up for the third installment of the most successful animated franchise in all moviedom. Shrek tries to avoid the mantle of leadership and realities of fatherhood by heading off with Puss and Donkey to seek out the kingdoms only other heir a clumsy lad named Arthur (Justin Timberlake). The trios trek to a medieval prep school is a smart parody of high-school coming-of-age comedies with a mean gum- chewing maiden offering up one of the tartest bits of dialogue. Meanwhile Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) has been biding his time doing dinner theater. At a seedy pub where storybook villians gather the embittered suitor recruits Captain Hook (Ian McShane) and other aggrieved baddies for an assault on Far Far Away. Their attack by air isnt the movies only nod to ""The Wizard of Oz"" just its most visually spectacular. Monty Python vet Eric Idle makes an appearance as Merlin a bumbler not unlike a certain whiz of a wiz. One measure of comedys pleasure might be how often you recount the best bits after leaving the theater. ""Shrek"" is loaded with the sort of set pieces both hysterical and satisfyingly amusing youll irk friends with. Of course weve suspected for some time that the Age of Innocence had passed and the Age of Irony was here to stay. Who knew that age would include not just teens but tweens and tots? For instance the movies agile wordplay puts one in the mind of the tangy barbs of ""Frasier."" ""Ladies assume the position"" says one of the quartet of princesses who make up Fionas coterie. What that turns out to mean for Cinderella Sleeping Beauty Snow White and Rapunzel (Amy Sedaris and SNL alum Cheri Oteri Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph) rivals Noel Coward. Pinocchios priceless attempt to dodge Prince Charmings interrogation recalls other recent equivocators. He never quite says ""It depends on what you mean by ..."" but his other evasions are side-splittingly twisted. The life that flashes before Gingerbread Mans frosted eyes is a nod to a 1970s TV show. And ""Shrek"" teases a level of pop-culture knowledge that will support the repeat viewings to which parents will certainly be subjected. The question is what will youngsters make of it? A quick answer When Puss doffs his hat to play sad kitty it was as if the youngster guffawing and talking back at the screen during a preview had waited his entire life to see that gag once more. Sure ""Shrek the Third"" is a chockful of the borrowed and parodied. Yet director Chris Miller and co-writers Jeffrey Price Peter Seaman and Aron Warner are so confident in their sequels cleverness they dont even bother to nail down one of their finest puns. In a wonderfully interminable death scene a frog kings bulging eyes bulge further as he gasps his second-to-last breath more than once. One waits then waits some more for the obvious but never uttered punchline. Leaving us to wonder Will he or wont he croak?

Save for later Saved The third installment in the hit comedy series makes leaps in animation but not in plot. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 18 2007 Save for later Saved The law of diminishing returns is no more apparent than in the movie world. A sequel with rare exceptions is worse than the film it follows and sequels of sequels fare even worse.Such is the case with ""Shrek the Third."" As a big fan of the first ""Shrek"" I was let down by ""Shrek 2"" which seemed pitched less to children than to smart-alecky adults. The film was a commercial hit anyway.Its likely that ""Shrek the Third"" will be a hit too although the children in the audience for my press screening didnt exactly look as if they were having the time of their lives. It may not matter - the ""Shrek"" brand is so pervasive that the quality of the films has become secondary to their success. They are triumphs of merchandising not imagination. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""Shrek the Third"" the green ogre is in line to become king of Far Far Away. Since this is the last thing he wants he sets out with Donkey and Puss In Boots to find the only other heir to the throne - Artie the long-lost cousin of Shreks pregnant wife Fiona. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 With a mixture of new songs and oldies (including Wings ""Live and Let Die"") ""Shrek the Third"" tries to create an aural environment that will go down well with both kids and adults. The in-joke pop culture references are almost as abundant as they were in ""Shrek 2"" and are not much better. (The sign for the kingdom of Far Far Away is a duplicate of the ""Hollywood"" sign in Los Angeles and so on).Maybe the filmmakers needed to insert these gags in order to stay sane but what about the rest of us?Theres another problem here. In the first ""Shrek"" the life lessons were kept to a minimum. In ""Shrek 2"" the green one became touchy-feely and his relationship to Fiona was gooey. In the new film Shrek has to learn to believe in himself.Its not that I object to animated characters having human dimensions. Its just that the soporific uplift provided by the last two ""Shrek"" movies is just as banal as in any old live-action Hollywood drama. The imaginative leaps in the animation are dragged down by the deadweight storytelling. While its true that from a technical standpoint the ""Shrek"" movies continue to improve its also true that technique isnt everything. Wheres the victory in showing off a new and improved green skin tone or a more detailed blade of grass if the production itself is blurry with the same old cliches?Grade C+Rated PG for some crude humor and suggestive content.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Thursday May 17 2007 932 PM See also Photo gallery ""Shrek the Third"" Second sequel to the computer-animated hit about a green ogre his princess and the enchanted land of Far Far Away. Voices of Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Antonio Banderas. Directors Chris Miller Raman Hui (132). PG Adult jokes. Area theaters. If the writing for ""Shrek the Third"" is the best they could do its time for DreamWorks to take the series about a gentle green ogre to Saturday- morning TV. The second sequel to the fabulous 2001 blockbuster doesnt look like Saturday TV fare; nor is its look as colorfully exciting as the earlier movies. Frankly it just looks tired as if the computer animators had as hard a time being creative as the writers. Where the first two films laced their stories with references to and appearances by familiar fairy tale characters ""Shrek the Third"" is almost totally dependent upon them. And there are only so many nose-growing-Pinocchio and stumbling-Blind Mice sight gags one can appreciate. Worse at least for parents with little ones in tow the new movie wallows in lame jokes aimed at adults such as one where a husky whisker-studded transsexual princess says of Prince Charming he ""makes me hotter than July."" And where the first two movies had useful themes of acceptance and tolerance the simplistic premise here is that a good lecture can turn villains into good guys. When ""Third"" opens Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is trying to tell Shrek (Mike Myers) that there is a little ogre in the oven. By the end shes nursing triplets. In between Shrek suffers paternal angst and nightmares while on a journey to find Fionas cousin Artie (Justin Timberlake) heir to the late Far Far Away King Harolds crown. And while Shrek and his now bosom buddies Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) are away Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) gathers the villains of fairy tales past - Captain Hook the Big Bad Wolf the Headless Horseman - and takes over Far Far Away. In the bowels of the castle Fiona her mother (Julie Andrews) and their retinue of protofeminist princesses burn their bras plump their courage and set out to retake the kingdom. At a brief 92 minutes ""Third"" still does a lot of vamping. Theres a long unfunny sequence where a flaky Merlin the Magician (Eric Idle) leads Shreks band on a mystical ""journey of the soul"" then transports them on an electrical bolt back to Far Far Away. When they reappear Donkey and Puss in Boots are in each others bodies. This is funny for the first couple of exchanges but it goes on and on and the switch mutes the humor of two of the casts most effective voice actors. Its not all bad. There is a funny early sequence where Prince Charming is being jeered for his lousy cabaret act in a village pub and a hilarious death-lily scene with the bullfrog King Harold (John Cleese) trying to squeak out the name of his heir while snapping up one last fly. Wish there had been more of this. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Shrek the Third"" with the voices of Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Antonio Banderas Julie Andrews John Cleese Rupert Everett Justin Timberlake and Eric Idle. Directed by Chris Miller from a screenplay by Jeffrey Price Peter S. Seaman Miller and Aron Warner based on the book by William Steig. 93 minutes. Rated PG for some crude humor suggestive content and swashbuckling action. Opening late tonight in several theaters; opens wide Friday. The first two ""Shrek"" movies in 2001 and 2004 (the latter of which now sits comfortably at 3 on the all-time domestic box office list) had essentially the same plot Ogre loves princess; love trouble ensues; talking donkey makes wisecracks; love conquers all. ""Shrek the Third"" for all its faults comes up with something novel this time around. The handsome villain Prince Charming (lubriciously voiced by Rupert Everett) returns to the Kingdom of Far Far Away to wreak his revenge ... and does so by staging a musical. The idea of usurping the throne by presenting an utterly random half-baked imitation of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" crossed with ""Spamalot"" is so delicious grown-up viewers of ""Shrek the Third"" may well find themselves completely distracted. (Perhaps Prince Charles might wish to mull the concept over.) Alas once weve had our fun with this particular plot point we realize that the reason it stands out is because the rest of the movie just isnt that funny. This time around Shrek (Mike Myers) and wife Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are expecting a little Shreklet and theyre working out some Relationship Issues around that and Far Far Away needs a new king and the donkey (Eddie Murphy) and his furry nattily shod sidekick Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) wisecrack a lot. All this may be quite enough for kids looking for something snappy to accompany their popcorn and Skittles and certainly the two grade-schoolers who joined me for the screening giggled throughout and had a fine time. But those of us charmed by the original ""Shrek"" (and to a lesser extent the second one) and its ability to mix fairy-tale sweetness with some hilariously grown-up cleverness -- much of which sailed happily above the heads of the kiddies -- will leave disappointed. Much of this ""Shrek"" feels like a retread a cash cow without enough ideas to justify its existence. The four screenwriters (including the films director Chris Miller) cant seem to create much excitement in the warmed-over plot instead relying on the same old shtick. And sometimes that shtick is a kick particularly a funeral at which a melancholy chorus of frogs belts out ""Live and Let Die"" (yes the Wings version) like they mean it and later someones note-perfect delivery of the classic battle line ""Look out Theyve got a piano"" A few insider jokes sneak through too such as when the Queen (voiced by Julie Andrews) momentarily stunned by bashing her head against a wall suddenly hums a few bars from a ""Mary Poppins"" tune. The animation is first-rate (note how you can see every stitch in Shreks ratty sweater) and the voice work is A-list; particularly Murphy whos got a way of making every line seem utterly spontaneous. So no ""Shrek the Third"" isnt a disaster. But its an example of how a meal can be delightful at its first appearance pretty good warmed up for leftovers and still OK but getting flavorless by its third appearance. This franchise is coasting; maybe its time to apply the brakes.

Thing is he doesnt want to. 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Shrek the Third Animated comedy. With the voices of Mike Myers Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy. Directed by Chris Miller and Raman Hui. (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Anyone who has ever watched a sitcom for a few years already knows the pattern. First the setup. Later the main characters are married off. Finally when the writers get really desperate they bring on the babies. The ""Shrek"" series is following that road map and yet something funny is happening along the way ""Shrek the Third"" gets back the mood the pleasure and even some of the freshness of its first installment. Though the series dipped into corniness with ""Shrek 2"" ""Shrek the Third"" has none of that. Its irreverent and fast paced and is designed to please impatient parents just as much as children. There are some pop culture references to the 1970s with Hearts ""Barracuda"" and Led Zeppelins ""Immigrant Song"" featured on the soundtrack but theres never the sense of a movie begging for laughs by throwing in anachronisms. The jokes are organic to the movie to its sly and slightly caustic worldview and they dont stop coming from start to finish. Theres a great bit in which one of the villains questions Pinocchio about the whereabouts of Shrek (Mike Myers) knowing that Pinocchio cant lie. ""Well I dont know where hes not"" Pinocchio begins and launches into a series of carefully worded answers worthy of a politician on a Sunday morning talk show ""Im possibly more or less not definitely rejecting the idea ..."" The original notion that inspired the series of a magical and yet workaday land where fairy tale characters go about their lives still provides a source for cheeky humor. This time out the arrogant and overweening Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) reduced to working as a sideshow performer decides to corral the energy of all the disgruntled villains whose ""happily-ever-after"" never happened. These characters like Rumplestiltskin Captain Hook and the Evil Queen live a marginal existence spending their lives drinking in a loser bar and they jump at the chance to help Charming take over the kingdom. Charming sees his opening because King Harold (John Cleese) the frog is dead. His deathbed scene in the movies first minutes sets the tone. Theres no sentiment about it. Its grotesque protracted and ridiculous -- and very funny. He leaves Shrek the kingdom if he wants it. The only other possible heir is a young fellow named Arthur (Justin Timberlake) who lives far away. As Shrek has no interest in being king he sets out with his two companions Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) to find him. Uh-oh. A journey. We know what that usually means in animated movies The whole story is going to be about the journey with a series of incidents thrown in to stretch the thing to feature length. But no. That doesnt happen here. Eight screenwriters contributed to the screenplay of ""Shrek the Third"" and they wrote it as if they had a boot on their neck. Things happen fast. Bits that another film might have milked for an hour ""Shrek the Third"" condenses to 10 or 15 minutes. And just when you think you know all their moves the filmmakers come at you from another angle. The revisionist takes on legendary and fairy-tale characters are a consistent source of amusement Rapunzel (Maya Rudolph) has hair extensions. Snow White (Amy Poehler) is vain and resourceful and Guinevere (Latifa Ouaou) of future ""Camelot"" fame is an insufferably self- absorbed high school girl. It also helps that the prattle of Murphy as Donkey is kept to a minimum. The film has two directors Chris Miller and Raman Hui neither of whom has ever made a feature film though both have extensive experience working on the visual side of animation. Its probably no accident that for all its other virtues ""Shrek the Third"" is an unusually pretty movie to look at beautiful in both execution and design. In fact though its subtle ""Shrek the Third"" gives a beauty makeover to Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) slimming her down and softening her facial features. Either that or shes glowing from being pregnant.

Note that I say ""was."" As far as the adventures of Shrek go it grieves me to report that the third time is charmless. Swamp Thing drafted here to succeed the dying king is adrift. And his film is becalmed. Shrek the Third isnt a movie its the extension of a brand. Its hard being Green especially when your corporation relies on you to make sure its ledgers stay that color and youre making a movie and youre busy rehearsing the Broadway-bound Shrek The Musical and preparing the holiday special Shrek the Halls. No wonder the ogre frowns at the idea of wearing the crown. Too little time. Whats even worse about Shrek the Third too few smiles. The last installment of the Shrek trilogy opens with a comical deathbed scene As his dying wish King Harold wants Shrek to succeed him. Evidently Far Far Away is a family business where the son-in-law is handed the reins rather than a monarchy where the closest blood relative - paging Princess Fiona - assumes the crown. The prospect of wearing a corset and hosting state dinners at the castle doesnt appeal to Shrek whose taste runs to crocheted vests and crockpot meals. The prospect of a Shrekling which appears imminent appeals to him even less. So Shrek does what heroes have done since Odysseus. He goes on a quest leaving wifey home to defend herself against the man who would be king Prince Charming. Shrek (the roguish brogue of Mike Myers) accompanied by his faithful Donkey and Puss in Boots sets sail to find Fionas half-brother Artie (voice of Justin Timberlake) geek-princeling at the medieval version of the high school in The OC. Shrek is hoping to crown him King Artie. In a Camelot gag that only adults will get Arties tormentor at school is Lancelot. Where the prior installments of the Shrek saga had a defining plotline Shrek 3 has three parallel stories each it would seem pitched to a different demographic. In theory the one about the geek picked on by jocks appeals to boys the expectant-father anxiety plays to adults and the tale of how Fiona and the princesses (Snow White Cinderella Sleeping Beauty Rapunzel) foil a coup in Shreks absence intrigues girls. The sight of Fiona and her Disney-princess posse morphing into a medieval Charlies Angels made me almost snicker. Whatever happened to movies that unify the audience instead of slicing them into pieces of demographic pie? Whatever happened to building a joke that has a payoff instead of punning on a pop-culture phenom? Visually speaking the characters in Shrek the Third are colorfully drawn and beautifully detailed virtues that have the effect of making Shrek Fiona and gang seem even more monochromatic and generic.

"Lucky strike - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Lucky strike Jokes and jabs fly fast and furious in Shrek the Third a welcome addition to the star-studded series Mike Myers once again speaks the role of Shrek in the third installment of these fractured fairy tales. (DreamWorks Animation and Paramount Pictures) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  May 17 2007 When the names of the stars doing the voices for ""Shrek the Third"" appear merrily at the end some cheer is in order. Mike Myers as Shrek  Eddie Murphy as Donkey  Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots  Theyre good and hammy at what they do. But obviously the real stars are the hundreds of artists and technicians who get this story told with so much visual accuracy and wit. People like Guillaume Aretos  who oversaw the production design; Tim Cheung  who headed the character animation; and all the folks they worked with.Never mind that their names might not mean as much to an audience as those of super-exes Cameron Diaz (she does Princess Fionas voice) and Justin Timberlake (he joins the cast as a young King Arthur ). The movie wouldnt be nearly as enjoyable without the participation of the way-below-the-title names. In-jokes and jabs at the bland conventions of classic and recent Disney animation are this series stock in trade but physical and facial realism are the biggest achievements in DreamWorks s fractured fairy tales.This new one finds its big green ogre not interested at all in royal life or fatherhood. When Fiona tells Shrek shes pregnant he has a terrific grotesque nightmare in which hes attacked by millions of Shrek babies. Hed rather be back in his shabby hut. But after froggy King Harold (John Cleese ) falls ill Shrek temporarily takes on official royal duties. In a magnificently prolonged deathbed sequence he leaves his crown to Shrek . He doesnt want it though forcing the poor old frog to come up with a plan B before he croaks. Its a teenager named Arthur  whom Shrek  Donkey  and Puss hit the road to fetch.The journey is not very exciting but the destinations are inspired. Arthur -- or Artie  as he prefers -- attends a medieval school thats like a combination of Hogwarts and Ridgemont High . And at some point a crusty Merlin (Eric Idle ) shows up and does some magic that has amusing consequences for Donkey and Puss.Meanwhile Prince Charming (Rupert Everett ) still smarting that Shrek married his girl has convinced a mob of defeated storybook villains (Captain Hook  the Evil Queen  etc.) that they should avenge themselves. So they nastily descend upon the Far Far Away kingdom which apparently is located on the Paramount Studios lot. Fiona and the queen (Julie Andrews ) are swiftly locked up along with Snow White (Amy Poehler) Sleeping Beauty (Cheri Oteri ) and Cinderella (Amy Sedaris ) Fionas more typical storybook counterparts whove been reimagined as ungrateful yuppie snobs. Charmings terrorism culminates in the mounting of a musical production that demonstrates what Andrew Lloyd Webber might do with a Disney version of Rapunzel .Needless to say the overall surprise of the original ""Shrek"" which was based on William Steigs beautifully told and drawn book cant be recaptured. The movie was a wholesale rejection of glossy cartoon cheer and the general Disneyification of fairy tales and seemingly came from nowhere. Its weave of barbed pop-culture jokes and emotional sincerity had been available on ""The Simpsons"" for years but ""Shrek "" made it seem workable at the movies. The second installment ""Shrek 2"" unbraided the gags from the feeling tipping the balance to gleeful cynicism which while fun to watch was discomforting. It seemed to come to the filmmakers much more easily than the storys emotional dimensions.With ""Shrek the Third "" the series still favors the jokes -- Led Zeppelin  Heart  and Wings songs are put to amusing use. But director Chris Miller and the credited writers (there are four) are determined that if these films are to be a collection of riffs and gags with a sweet afterthought for a finale then they ought to be very good. And largely these are.Of course many of them come at the expense of the title star. The movie is stolen from him by everyone from Murphys jackass and Banderass kitty cat to Pinocchio (Cody Cameron ) and the Gingerbread Man (Conrad Vernon ) who might be this seriess funniest creation. Because of Shreks ubiquity as a marketing force he seems overly familiar as do his parenting and self-esteem woes. But his yielding the stage is an act of generosity that allows you to savor the smaller things. So while there is some pleasure in Shreks life struggles its the sight and sound of a dying frog that I wont soon forget.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Shrek the Third | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; shrek-the-third ) Shrek the Third (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Four words say all that needs to be said about Shrek the Third more of the same. The problem is what seems fresh and pleasing the first time through starts to feel a little stale by the time weve gone through it three times (not counting video games and an amusement park ride). The recipe hasnt changed take a few appealing characters surround them with slightly off-kilter versions of our favorite fairy tale personalities in a land far far away mix in some pop songs and hip cultural references and keep the tone generally light. It worked beautifully in Shrek and was still appealing in Shrek 2. By installment 3 it has become a little tiresome. Kids will still love the big green ogre and his wisecracking donkey but adults may find that the formula is wearing thin. Shrek the Third is a classic example of a movie that exists because its predecessor made a lot of money. (436 million domestically to be exact.) Theres no creative reason for this movie to have been greenlighted. Its a mass-marketed product plain and simple where product tie-ins fatten an already gorged pot. Thats capitalism at work. King Harold (John Cleese) the majestic frog ruler of Far Far Away is dying. On his way out the door he names Shrek (Mike Myers) as his heir. This frightens the big guy so he goes looking for a suitable replacement and the only candidate is a guy named Arthur (Justin Timberlake). Shrek Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss n Boots (Antonio Banderas) go on a trek to find him. When they track him down in a high school what they discover isnt promising. Meanwhile back in Far Far Away a coup has taken place. Bitter Prince Charming (Rupert Evert) tired of being a dinner theater has-been has seized control imprisoning Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) Snow White Cinderella Sleeping Beauty Rapunzel and a few others. When Shrek returns Far Far Away will not be the kingdom he left. But how hard could it be to defeat the preening prince and his army of fairy tale villains? Just appeal to their better natures. The storyline shows little in the way of originality or energy but one wonders where else the movie could have gone since most of the story possibilities were played out by the end of the second installment. The screenplay which is credited to four writers isnt a complete bust. In keeping with the Shrek tradition it contains a few genuinely funny moments and a sprinkling of smart one-liners. For my money the best sequences occur right after Shrek temporarily takes on certainly ""kingly"" duties while King Harold is abed. His attempts to bestow a knighthood and christen a ship arent resounding successes. Its also amusing to watch Snow White (Amy Poehler) go into ninja mode. Weve seen something like this before (Fiona in the original Shrek) but it has a certain entertainment value. There arent as many pop references as in the previous Shreks. Two of the more obvious are homages to Rosemarys Baby and The Six Million Dollar Man. Julie Andrews also sings a line from ""My Favorite Things."" Shrek the Third is directed by the team of Chris Miller and Raman Hui both of whom have prior associations with the ogres misadventures. Miller provided some dialogue for Shrek and Shrek 2. Hui was the supervising animator for the previous movies. Together they create what is visually the most impressive entry of the series and arguably the most stunning computer generated animated feature to date. Every frame is sharp bright and elegant with amazing textural depth and attention to detail. More impressively the newest addition to the Shrek family Arthur looks surprisingly lifelike indicating that its becoming less of an imposing task to animate people. Its almost enough to forget about the throwaway plot and simply enjoy the way the characters and settings have been rendered. The voice casting is fine although half the roster seems to be comprised of current or former SNL performers. Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Amy Poehler Cheri Oteri (Sleeping Beauty) and Maya Rudolph (Rapunzel) all have significant speaking roles. Also two members of the Monty Python troupe are represented John Cleese and Eric Idle (as Merlin). The standout to the extent that there is one remains Murphy although hes not as lively as in Shrek or Shrek 2. Justin Timberlake is forgettable as Arthur but that may have as much to do with the whiny character as his voice work. Shrek the Third follows the formula well enough that it will become a must-see for anyone whose age has not yet ascended into double-digit territory. Whats disappointing about this movie is that it offers so little to older viewers. One thing that was true of the previous Shreks was that they worked so well on different levels that viewers of all ages could enjoy them. Parents could appreciate the films while acting as chaperones for their offspring. Single adults could go without feeling embarrassed. Unfortunately Shrek the Third seems like so many other generic animated movies. Take away the Shrek moniker and youre left with a slickly made version of Happily NEver After. Artistically the well appears to be running dry but that doesnt mean there wont be a Shrek 4. All thats needed is a box office windfall and the animators will begin cranking out the next sequel before the black ink has dried on the accounting books for this one.

While still mirthful and eccentric enough to amuse his hordes of admirers the irascible green ogre begins to show signs of encroaching middle age in ""Shrek the Third."" After a buoyantly funny first half-hour stylish animated comedy takes a breather before ramping it up again for a rambunctious girrrl-power finale that provides a convenient springboard for further adventures to come. As the 920 million in worldwide B.O. for ""Shrek 2"" three years ago nearly doubled the take of the 2001 original there can be little doubt about similarly monstrous results this time around. The ""Shrek"" industry continues to expand beyond the feature films themselves. The short ""Shrek 4-D"" bridged the gap between the first two pictures a ""Shrek the Halls"" holiday TV spec looms later this year and ""Shrek The Musical"" will head for Broadway next season. Shrek and his bride Fiona prove similarly fertile in the new outing. With the death -- in a hilariously protracted scene -- of the Frog King (voiced by John Cleese) the crown of Far Far Away is Shreks to refuse and refuse it he must given the oafishness with which he performs the most menial royal functions. ""I am an ogre. Im not cut out for this"" he complains to his wife unaware shes got a wee one growing in her belly. Pic peaks with a resultant fatherhood nightmare in which panicked Shrek is engulfed in a flood of demanding ogre tykes from whom there can be no escape. But before he is forced to cope with fatherhood Shrek must tend to the business of finding a replacement for himself on the throne. Prime suspect in this line is Artie (Justin Timberlake) Fionas half-brother who lives in another land far far away reached by Shrek Donkey and Puss in Boots after a lengthy sea voyage. Although the region is called Worcestershire it bears more than a passing resemblance to the OC given the American-accented layabouts who lard their speech with ""like"" and ""whatever."" What may have been the filmmakers idea of an amusing gag in fact comes off as pandering to young Yank viewers. Artie is a good-looking but dweeby outcast the butt of fun for rival Lancelots crew and dismissive of Shreks entreaties even as they travel together toward Far Far Away. Film itself is becalmed when their ship runs aground and the action is briefly dominated by a broken-down New Agey Merlin (Eric Idle) whose magical powers arent what they once were. Providing more fun is Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) who after a failed career in dinner theater convinces a tavern full of villains (Captain Hook Cyclops et al.) to join him in conquering Far Far Away and enjoy their own happy ending for once. Ultimately opposing them is a band of heretofore sweet young things (Cinderella Sleeping Beauty Snow White and Rapunzel among them) who take matters into their own hands while Shrek Artie and Fiona are sorting out their futures. Having moved on to ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" franchise Andrew Adamson director of the first two ""Shrek"" entries has handed the reins to Chris Miller who worked as a story artist and provided vocals on the earlier installments. From a visual and storytelling p.o.v. transition is seamless. Notable details this time include the attention to facial and physical nuance in Shreks characterization and the evident delight Miller and the artists have taken in the design and minutiae of the stage productions rendered in the opening and closing sequences. Franchise stars Mike Myers Cameron Diaz Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas continue their stellar voice work and the latter two have some choice moments in the late going thanks to a clever gag involving the Donkey and Puss in Boots characters. Musical elements are bright as usual. Shrek the ThirdProductionA Paramount release of a DreamWorks Animation SKG presentation of a PDI/DreamWorks production. Produced by Aron Warner.
