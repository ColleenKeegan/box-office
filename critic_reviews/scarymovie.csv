Entertainment; Release Date Wide 07/07/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 88; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Dimension Films Posted July 21 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT The only thing scary about Scary Movie is the blithe voraciousness with which Dimension Films Miramaxs hard-charging anti-arthouse division is willing to eat its own children to disgorge a box office hit. The same folks who proudly sponsored Scream (funny) Scream 2 (even more clever) and Scream 3 (relatively funny but enoughs enough) now back a cheerfully gross dirty funny messy parody that cannibalizes what was already a cannibalization of less ironic teen-in-peril horror formulas. That this canny carny act directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans marks the end of the wiseacre self-referential disappearing-up-their-own-butts cycle of youth-market movies one can only pray. At the very least the arrival of Wayans rude raunchy throw- away spoof means the Farrelly brothers will have to up their ante in the future stretching beyond their usual punchlines of tushies and body fluids to generate comparable howls of shocked laughter. Wayans who previously dabbled in genre mockery with Im Gonna Git You Sucka now takes swipes at I Know What You Did Last Summer The Matrix American Pie The Usual Suspects The Sixth Sense Dawsons Creek and The Blair Witch Project among other targets. In an homage to/theft of Farrelly mojo he also gets a lot of mileage out of rubbery testicles (I hope theyre rubber) and a springy hillock of synthetic pubic hair. Mostly though Wayans deconstructs the Scream paradigm Someone wearing a familiar Edvard Munch-inspired mask and wielding a Last Summer grappling hook is killing a lot of idiotic high schoolers. (Faced with directional signs pointing the way to SAFETY and DEATH one foolish nymphet -- played deliciously by Carmen Electra leaving a dangerously tumescent bag of Jiffy Pop unattended -- therefore chooses death.) Newcomer Anna Faris holds the Neve Campbell/good girl position; improv comic Dave Sheridan out-dumbs David Arquette as a less-than-genius cop; and SNLs Cheri Oteri seethes appropriately as a crazily aggressive broadcast bitch tracking the murders so she can publish a follow-up to her best-seller Youre Dead Im Rich. Wayans doesnt possess nearly the filmmaking finesse of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team that created the sublime Airplane and The Naked Gun movies. But (with screenplay help from his brothers and cast members Shawn and Marlon along with four other credited writers) the director retains a serviceable sense of slapdash see-what-sticks gross-out moreness. Scary Movie stacks titillating sexual jokes on top of spiked racial barbs on top of lame-o visual puns and just plain cheap misfires. The whole thing wobbles like the garish trashy sexy shoes the young folks are wearing this summer on their way (in droves) to movie theaters intent on abandoning themselves to pleasurable mindlessness. Its a sight to make the omnivores at Dimension scream with delight. B Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

"Scary Movie | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; scary-movie ) Scary Movie (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli It seems that every new comedy to arrive in theaters pushes the envelope further daring the MPAA to give it an NC-17. Scary Movie from the demented and very funny minds of the Wayans Brothers becomes the latest motion picture to risk censure in the name of laughter - and gets away with it. Featuring scenes that make American Pie Theres Something About Mary and Me Myself and Irene seem almost tame Scary Movie combines the raunchiness of 90s teen comedies with the single-movie spoof approach of Mel Brooks and the rapid-fire barrage of gags and jokes used in Airplane and The Naked Gun. With body fluids flowing almost as fast as the stream of often profane and off-color zingers Scary Movie proves to be the kind of film that will shock the faint-of-heart and leave just about everyone else laughing until tears run down their cheeks. Offended by gay and anti-gay humor? Avoid Scary Movie. Shocked by the sight of an erect (albeit prosthetic) penis? Avoid Scary Movie. Horrified by the thought of seeing grandma take a header down the stairs then get run over by a piano? Avoid Scary Movie. Put off by the concept of a character so stoned that when he gets shot in the lung smoke puffs out of the hole? Avoid Scary Movie. Embarrassed to laugh at some admittedly juvenile humor? Avoid Scary Movie. But if all those things are your cup of tea you might think this is the best film of the summer. Its certainly the funniest one Ive seen year-to-date. Only about 30-40% of the jokes in Scary Movie work. There are a lot of clunkers and some that are simply too dumb to generate a response. However considering the sheer quantity of material that is thrown at us even a failure rate of more than 50% represents a lot of laughs. The Wayans Brothers use the same saturation comedy approach that worked so well in the 80s classics produced by the team of Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker. And while the Airplane style has resulted in a number of stale duds this is not one of them. The central target of the Wayans wit is Scream. Its certainly not the only movie to be skewered by Scary Movie but its the most obvious. Borrowing the overall plot on an almost scene-by-scene basis director Keenen Ivory Wayans sharpens his knives and starts cutting away at characters and situations. He then throws in sliced-and-diced pieces from I Know What You Did Last Summer Scream 2 Election The Blair Witch Project Titanic/Amistad The Sixth Sense The Matrix The Usual Suspects and probably a few others. (Note the list of films parodies are strictly 90s vintage. None of the older entries like Halloween or Friday the 13th are approached with any vigor.) Even the ""Wazzup"" TV commercials get a moments exposure and theres a none-too-subtle reference to ""Laverne amp; Shirley"". As one might reasonably expect some of these lampoons work better than others but when one fails theres another just around the corner. The film opens with bodacious high school student Drew Becker (Carmen Electra who cheerfully toys with her image) making popcorn when the phone rings. A voice on the other end inquires what her favorite scary movie is and she immediately replies ""Kazaam"" Soon shes running through sprinklers in her underwear with a masked man in pusuit. The next day her murder is big news at the local high school and pushy reporter Gale Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri) is on hand to get the story. Meanwhile cute and innocent Cindy (Anna Faris who bears a resemblance to Katie Holmes and is making her feature debut) begins to worry that the murder might have something to do with a man she and her friends accidentally killed last Halloween. Her closest pals Buffy the bimbo (Shannon Elizabeth the exchange student from American Pie) and Brenda (Regina Hall) and her boyfriend Bobby (Jon Abrahams) try to convince her otherwise. But the killer is soon stalking her and not even the efforts of Deputy Dufy (Dave Sheridan) can save the day. One inherent problem with this type of motion picture is a tendency to lose comic momentum and Scary Movie suffers from the malaise. The film has a significantly higher laugh quotient at the beginning than near the end and there are several noticeable dead spots during the final half-hour (part of that results from the necessity of replicating almost every ""twist"" that happened in Scream). A shorter tighter version of Scary Movie probably would have been better but the films lean running length of 82 minutes is already on the low side of what will play in a multiplex. Nevertheless the material generates so much laughter that the overriding post-viewing impression is of an uneven film thats definitely worth the time investment. Wayans gets away with several instances of humor that only a black filmmaker could apply without being called a racist. (He may still be labeled a homophobe and a misogynist by certain overly-sensitive individuals.) For example he gleefully parodies the image of blacks as being loud obnoxious theater-goers in a way that no white director would ever attempt. This isnt the first time he has challenged the precepts of political correctness. His feature debut Im Gonna Get You Sucka (a parody of blaxploitation movies) and his groundbreaking TV show ""In Living Color"" both spent a lot of time on the edge. With Scary Movie Wayans is taking this approach as far as the MPAA will allow. Scary Movie had two working titles both of which were more original than the final one (which not coincidentally was the working title for Scream). Like the Wayans vastly inferior 1996 spoof of urban dramas Dont Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood this films provisional titles spliced together references to the movies it satirized Last Summer I Screamed Because Halloween Fell On Friday the 13th and Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween. But (with apologies to William Shakespeare) this movie by any name would be as entertaining.

Unbounded by taste inhibition or political correctness this potential summer sleeper boldly goes where no one not even Peter and Bobby Farrelly has gone before with mainstream megaplex fare.

The outer limits of R-rated respectability are stretched if not shredded by Keenen Ivory Wayans gleefully gross and exuberantly smutty ""Scary Movie"" a zany scattershot spoof of teen horror pics high-school sex comedies and assorted pop-culture phenomena. Unbounded by taste inhibition or political correctness this potential summer sleeper boldly goes where no one not even Peter and Bobby Farrelly has gone before with mainstream megaplex fare. Many critics social commentators and op-ed writers may express outrage which should only make the pic even more attractive to the under-30 target aud. Combine that with crafty positioning by Dimension Pictures and undeniable crossover appeal and you have the makings of a breakout smash. The freewheeling script -- reportedly distilled from two independently conceived and completed scenarios -- is credited to six scribes including co-stars Shawn and Marlon Wayans brothers of the director. Despite the patchwork construction there is something like a plot to connect the assorted sight gags satirical bits rude remarks and sketch-comedy episodes. But the slender narrative (think ""Scream"" meets ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" with a side order of ""American Pie"") is never allowed to get in the way of a cheap laugh or an inspired non sequitur. ""Scary Movie"" remains sufficiently flexible and loosely knit to encompass among other things references to ""The Usual Suspects"" ""The Sixth Sense"" ""Dawsons Creek"" ""Amistad"" (dont ask) and ""The Matrix."" The humor is so aggressively up-to-the-moment theres even a joke about the Budweiser ""Whassup?"" ads and a fleeting mention of ""Big Mommas House."" In short this is the work of filmmakers who have studied ""Airplane"" and the ""Naked Gun"" pics with all the attentiveness that used to be reserved for the likes of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The 400 Blows."" The good news is that Keenen Ivory Wayans and his collaborators learned their lessons enough to be consistent in their silliness. (It probably helped that the director already cut his teeth on the blaxploitation spoof ""Im Gonna Get You Sucka"") Unlike most spoofs of this helter-skelter sort ""Scary Movie"" manages an impressively huge score in the hit-or-miss gag ratio. The story such as it is revolves around a group of teens -played in true teen-pic fashion by actors in their 20s and 30s -- who share a deep dark secret about a pedestrian they accidentally killed during a late-night drunk-driving joyride. (The victim wasnt fatally injured but he wound up dead anyway.) Now the young friends must cope with an apparently vengeful killer whose mask occasionally resembles that worn by the mad slasher of the ""Scream"" franchise. At other times though the mask ... well never mind. Lets just say that as running gags go this one gets an impressive amount of mileage. Director Wayans sets the tone during the opening minutes. Hell he sets it during the first 30 seconds when Carmen Electra playing a character named -- wink-wink nudge-nudge -- Drew passes gas while on the phone with the mad killer. Shortly afterward the slasher arrives to bury his knife in her bountiful bosom. When he removes the blade however he finds the point is embedded in a breast implant. Much of the rest of the pic proceeds in the same anything-goes vein. Theres a high school football player (Shawn Wayans) who can barely remain in the closet a hot-headed big man on campus (Lochlyn Munro) whos not so huge where it really counts and a pushy TV reporter (Cheri Oteri) whose latest bestseller is titled ""Youre Dead Im Rich."" But wait theres more a slutty airhead (Shannon Elizabeth) a jive-talking best friend (Regina Hall) a pot-smoking horror movie buff (Marlon Wayans) a horny boyfriend (Jon Abrahams) and a professional virgin (Anna Faris) who when deflowered sounds as ferocious as the possessed Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist."" At least two gags involving male genitalia -- especially one that uses an erect penis as an offensive weapon -- are shocking but explosively funny. Here and elsewhere ""Scary Movie"" is practically guaranteed to make you laugh until youre ashamed of yourself. Still questions inevitably arise Are erections R-rated only when theyre played for laughs? The well-cast leads appear ready for anything -- which considering what theyre asked to do is a very good thing -- but their unbridled enthusiasm never devolves into self-conscious campiness. Theyre funny largely because they seem to take everything so seriously. Tech credits are everything they have to be particularly when the pic manages to hit pay dirt with an homage to the overspoofed ""The Blair Witch Project."" And yes this is yet another pic that requires you to sit patiently through the closing credits for one last laugh. Scary MovieProductionA Dimension Pictures release of a Wayans Bros.

Starring Jon Abrahams Carmen Electra Shannon Elizabeth Anna Faris Cheri Oteri Shawn Wayans Marlon Wayans. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. (Rated R. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Anybody who needs a good laugh -- are there any lucky suckers out there who do not? -- can find it at ""Scary Movie."" The scary thing about this spoof of 90s teen horror movies is how funny it is. The gross-out jokes dont come in spurts but in geysers. The cast of over-the-hill over-the-top ""teenagers"" including a sprinkler-soaked Carmen Electra gets away with it like bandits. The Wayans brothers have weighed in with a film shrewdly aimed at the huge teenage audience for ""Scream"" ""Halloween"" ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and all their lucrative sequels. In the case of ""Scary Movie"" its tempting to call it filthy lucre. No one should say they werent given a heads up. The glossy 90s teen shockers ridiculed here -- along with ""The Matrix"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" thrown in just for the heck of it -- are sitting ducks for parody. Here are a few of the setups -- let ""Scary Movie"" provide the payoffs -- The young woman home alone in the knife-stocked kitchen who gets a call from the killer. -- The randy boyfriend who hankers for at least ""a PG-13"" flash. -- The football player whos more interested in patting butt than kicking it. -- The TV reporter who wont take any guff from showboating kids on camera behind her. -- The beauty contestant whose dramatic reading gets a big standing O. It just doesnt stop. If someone has to dispose of a dead body it helps if the body is dead first. Be wary of the daddy who tells his daughter he has to lie low the sheriff who passes around pictures to be identified or the girls gym teacher named Miss Mann. Director Keenen Ivory Wayans (""In Living Color"") takes no prisoners An itchy teacher gives very special treatment to the boys in her classroom and a genteel audience gets revenge at a showing of ""Shakespeare in Love."" How did they get the rights to use clips from that Academy Award winner? Where theres a will theres a Wayans -- or a Weinstein. Miramax mogul Harvey Weinstein had a hand in producing both the Gwyneth Paltrow film and this one. The white-masked hooded and hook-handed killer in ""Scary Movie"" is more of a doofus than a threat. He cowers behind a couch and its only a matter of time before something wipes that Edvard Munch scream off his face. The rude gleefulness of the ensemble cast ricochets off the screen and around the theater. This is one self-aware pack of teens -- they know Hollywood will ""cast kids in their their late 20s and early 30s to play us."" Mostly they pair off a guileless Shawn Wayans and mouthy Regina Hall (""Love amp; Basketball"" ""The Best Man"") and red-haired roving-eyed beauty Shannon Elizabeth (""American Pie"") and testosterone-packing blond hunk Lochlyn Munro. Jon Abrahams whose white-bread hip-hop ges tures come about a beat late is coupled with self-possessed newcomer Anna Faris right on top of things in her first screen role. Another Wayans Marlon shows up as the class clown. Cheri Oteri is the TV reporter who knows exactly what she has to do to get a story around here. -- Advisory This film contains gross-out humor. ..
