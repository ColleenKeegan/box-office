Nick Cannon and Christina Milian star in the romantic teen comedy ... more Finally a grown-up love story -- Nicholson and Keaton do maybe their best work ever as they create a nice mellow glow in Somethings Gotta Give 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Somethings Gotta Give Romantic comedy. Starring Jack Nicholson Diane Keaton and Keanu Reeves. Directed by Nancy Meyers. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are two Jack Nicholsons. Theres the Nicholson of the public image a cherub in sunglasses smiling like a demon and then theres the one we forget about between movies -- the heartfelt generous remarkably skilled actor. Perhaps the first Jack is a cover for the second Jacks sensitivity. In any case Nicholson the actor gives one of his most unguarded performances in ""Somethings Gotta Give"" an intelligent romantic comedy from writer-director Nancy Meyers. The adult romance is a dying genre in our era but movies as wise and fun as ""Somethings Gotta Give"" have always been rare. Its a comedy with hilarious moments and yet with an essential seriousness at its core Two people in the autumn of life find love. The characters enter the story with an awareness of past mistakes and of time passing but this awareness as with most people in the real world doesnt make them sentimental but practical. Meyers steers clear of sentiment and tells the story with directness and honesty. The film provides Diane Keaton with her best opportunity in years as Erica a divorced Broadway playwright who works out of a gorgeous beach house in the Hamptons. Divorced and years past any kind of romantic life she leads a solitary but satisfying existence cranking out hit shows while overlooking a gorgeous view and listening to French pop music on the stereo. There are worse ways to go through life. One day her daughter (Amanda Peet) shows up with her new boyfriend Harry (Nicholson) a 63-year-old record company executive who only dates very young women. Harry has a heart attack and after a few days the daughter goes back to the city leaving Harry who cant be moved in Ericas house. Anyone could guess what happens next She thinks hes a scoundrel which is really the same as saying she finds him intriguing. And he gradually becomes as one would with Diane Keaton drawn to her humor vivacity and idiosyncratic strength. Two things about the film are unexpected. The first is how charming it all is. Theres a scene in which the two of them are walking along the beach talking about their lives feeling each other out - in a sense needling each other and bantering in a gentle way. Their conversation is so relaxed and so natural and spontaneous that its hard to believe were watching people acting. Yet theres nothing sluggish in the direction. On the contrary the moments between the characters are absolutely full. Its a pleasure to watch such consummate professionals. The other surprise is how fast the movie whips through plot. In other hands the story of Harry and Erica coming to like each other might have taken up the whole picture -- and if these characters were in their 30s maybe it should have. But ""Somethings Gotta Give"" is about people at a different time of life. Not only are they too old to want to play games but they know that the other person is too old to fall for any games. So they cover a lot of ground in a hurry. Keaton is lovely in the more straightforward role as a woman of enormous self-sufficiency experiencing the inconvenience of a whole side of herself becoming suddenly reawakened. Sex and love were behind her and now theyre not. Perhaps as a female filmmaker Meyers felt no need to make a false concession to feminism. As such a woman most probably would be Erica is ready to jump right into a committed relationship. Nicholsons role is the more complex and perhaps as a result his performance has more going on. Harry has had an awakening too but to a new sense of vulnerability not just physical but also emotional. Like a lot of recovering heart patients he finds himself weeping at everything. So hes in no position to trust his feelings for Erica and he feels a responsibility not to waste her time. You may remember that great moment in ""As Good As It Gets"" when Nicholson tells Helen Hunt ""You make me want to be a better man."" ""Somethings Gotta Give"" is full of similar moments of revelation from Nicholson who has never been so tender or heartfelt onscreen. Or funny for that matter. His comic timing is a marvel. So ""Somethings Gotta Give"" gives us all this -- plus just for fun Keanu Reeves in the thankless role of the younger man Nicholsons cardiologist who becomes attracted to Erica. Reeves does fine and the role is an inevitable one but its the one place where we can feel Meyers stretching credulity in order to make things equitable between Erica and Harry. Sure Erica would have a nice handsome boyfriend but giving her the sweetest handsomest younger man in the world does seem like stacking the deck. -- Advisory This film contains sex talk a bedroom scene and sexual situations.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Diane Keaton scores in Somethings Gotta Give. Slate Sign In Sign Up Diane Keaton scores in Somethings Gotta Give. Diane Keaton scores in Somethings Gotta Give. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 12 2003 532 PM The Other Woman Diane Keaton scores in Somethings Gotta Give. By David Edelstein No more neurotic Annie Its tempting to forgive the director Nancy Meyers everything for writing Diane Keaton such a sleek and form-fitting role in the romantic comedy (with the meaningless title) Somethings Gotta Give (Columbia Pictures). The picture shows the actress off as beautifully as the white turtlenecks she wears As Erica Barry a successful divorced playwright in her late 50s Keaton is not only funny shes grounded without a hint of the old Annie Hall neurasthenic dither. For a time the most fragile of actresses (some of her great 80s performances were like wobbly tightrope acts) shes now lean and confident onscreen--and probably closer to the way she is in life. (When I interviewed her 15 years ago it struck me that the real Keaton wasnt the la-di-da Annie but the Annie who sat on a park bench with Woody Allen making snarky comments about passersby.) Meyers does give Keaton a laughing/crying hysterical number You cant let your female protagonist seem too together in a mainstream romantic comedy. But for most of the film shes dry warily defended and fantastically articulate. A revelation. The movie itself reveals nothing but its entertaining. Meyers structures it as a ""mature"" womans revenge fantasy. It begins with the infamous bachelor (and commitment-phobe) mogul Harry Langer (Jack Nicholson) delivering an ode to a procession of young creamy jaw-droppingly gorgeous model types. (""Some say Im an expert on younger women. Thats because Ive been dating them for over 40 years."") Then it proceeds to humiliate him first with a heart attack then with a display of his unappetizing bare buttocks then by competition from a character (played by Keanu Reeves) much younger and fitter than he is. Its a testament to how little erotic power older women hold in this culture that even with all those strikes against him Nicholsons Harry still seems the stronger figure. Advertisement Harrys current girlfriend Marin (Amanda Peet) is the daughter of Keatons Erica--who would barely penetrate his consciousness if she and her sister (Frances McDormand) didnt bust in on the couple in the early stages of foreplay. The movies sitcom premise is that Nicholson has a mild coronary while romancing Marin at her mothers East Hampton beach house Its the mom who has to look after him when his cardiologist (Reeves) wont let him go back to Manhattan. This creates an awkward situation for Harry whos not used to spending time with women his own age and one of the films big set pieces is when he stumbles across her naked and recoils in horror. Hes the only one who does by the way. It seems hardly fair to cast Keaton as Everyolderwoman since her body is willowy (she doesnt appear to have an ounce of adipose tissue) and there are many more plusses than minuses in her lack of plastic surgery. Her features are mobile and expressive her eyes bright her lips her own. She looks slim and gorgeous--more so than in some of her films from a decade ago. This is not a conventional ""chick flick"" because Meyers pulls off a neat trick. She shows you young women through the eyes of a man (i.e. ""the male gaze"") then shifts to the derisive perspective of an older woman. Its as if shes saying ""Im going to dangle these babes in front of you and then make relentless fun of you for looking."" She also has an ingenious device for her third act. Just when the love story (and potentially the movie) runs aground she has Erica write a hit play about her failed relationship with Harry--the ultimate payback and one that makes the earlier sitcom material seem less stilted in retrospect. (It develops more layers when you think about who Meyers might have been getting back at in her own life.) Theres an old-fashioned feel to Somethings Gotta Give. It recalls an earlier movie era of moneyed protagonists and glamour close-ups. (Its better-designed than most 50s romances though with a mutely tasteful palette of creamy whites and beiges and pale yellows.) Its a good thing its so much fun watching Diane and Jack play because there are no other characters. McDormand makes a great entrance but Meyers appears to forget about her. Peet begins promisingly by wriggling out of her clothes then recedes into a walking ad for blue-tinted contact lenses. (Those might be her real eyes but theyre still impossibly aquamarine.) Jon Favreau as Harrys assistant looks like hes there because he lost a bet. The preview audience burst out laughing when Keanu Reeves showed up as a doctor--not because he couldnt be but because he looks so much like those earnest male ingenues of the 50s and 60s who we now know were gay. I love Nicholson here because he lets Keaton take the movie--and his relative reticence is very attractive. He was quoted in the days of Reds (1981) saying that Keaton was ""impossible"" and maybe she still puts him on edge. Or maybe she has mellowed and he looks back on their contentious past with a certain fondness. Whatever they make each other seem more alive which is maybe the best thing you can say about a romantic comedy in which the protagonists are reduced to making jokes about wrinkle creams and Viagra.

He was a playwright (Eugene ONeill) with a carefully hidden sentimental side; she was the nonmonogamous free spirit who broke his heart. Now in Nancy Meyers romantic comedy ""Somethings Gotta Give"" the tables are turned -- a radiant Keaton is the playwright (the fictitious but Wendy Wasserstein-ish Erica Barry) who gets her heart shattered; Nicholson is the happy philanderer and they share a screen with the playfulness of old chums. Something funny happened to Diane Keatons career in those years since ""Reds"" -- she went from being one of the screens most honest and vivid actors (her glamour-free work as a betrayed wife in 1982s ""Shoot the Moon"" is nothing short of brilliant) to playing generic moms in forgettable Disney-fied fluff like ""Baby Boom"" and the ""Father of the Bride"" movies. (The little-seen 1996 drama ""Marvins Room"" in which an achingly soulful Keaton played a woman dying of cancer was a rare exception.) Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Somethings Gotta Give"" with Diane Keaton Jack Nicholson Keanu Reeves Amanda Peet Frances McDormand. Written and directed by Nancy Meyers. 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content brief nudity and strong language. Several theaters. Keatons fate isnt unusual for actresses who dare to develop lines around their eyes and mouth; what is unusual is how ""Somethings Gotta Give"" provides a showcase for this fiftysomething virtuoso to laugh cry look fabulous and get romanced by not only an aging stud but a young hunk (Keanu Reeves). Its her movie and she sparkles like that legendary diamond as big as the Ritz. Her trademark Annie Hall giggles and vocal wanderings have softened; shes here playing a grounded intelligent woman whos nonetheless amused by herself and by life. And like the great screwball comediennes of the past Keaton can make crying funny (though Meyers relies on this far too much). In short what we have here is an old-fashioned star turn from the unlikeliest of sources. Pity this performance cant be lodged in a better movie but ""Somethings Gotta Give"" is passable fantasy. Harry (Nicholson doing a relaxed spin on his usual bad-boy routine) in the early scenes is dating Ericas twentysomething daughter Marin (Amanda Peet). Hes a connoisseur of ""the sweet uncomplicated satisfaction of the younger woman"" and hes so pleased with himself he practically sings all his lines. But when a heart attack leaves him stranded at Ericas Hamptons beach house he becomes intrigued by this smart savvy woman whos close to his age -- except that shes dating Harrys thirtysomething doctor (Keanu Reeves playing perhaps the most laid-back physician in the history of cinema) whos equally smitten with her. Love sex heartbreak and the destruction of a perfectly nice turtleneck ensue. Meyers is careful to keep her film as controversy-free as possible; in line with her previous light romance- and family-oriented comedies (she directed ""What Women Want"" and the ""Parent Trap"" remake and wrote ""Baby Boom"" and the ""Father of the Bride"" movies among others). Like those films ""Somethings Gotta Give"" is a creamy Hollywood confection that isnt meant to challenge anyones comfortable ways of thinking. The movies few ideas (and theyre not especially radical -- for example the theory that some men are threatened by and afraid of accomplished mature women) are carefully put into the mouth of Ericas sister Zoe. Played by Frances McDormand (whose talents are wasted here) shes dismissed as ""a womens studies professor"" and shuffled out as quickly as possible. This plus an unrelenting emphasis on butter-yellow walls and swanky white furniture (this is one of those movies where you walk out humming the dining-room chairs) does contribute to a certain blandness in the filmmaking and in the hands of a lesser cast ""Somethings Gotta Give"" might have been a painful sit. But as a valentine to Keaton -- and a rare romantic comedy in which both leads need glasses to see what time it is -- it provides some long-overdue pleasures.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; something-s-gotta-give ) Somethings Gotta Give (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli I wanted to like this movie more than I actually did because it addresses a couple of provocative issues head-on without too much sugar coating. The first is the Hollywood tendency to devalue middle-age female actors relegating them to supporting roles and stripping them of all sex appeal. The second is the unwritten rule that all romantic comedies must feature young protagonists (in order not to alienate the all-important teenage audience). Somethings Gotta Give shows (gasp) that female sexuality does not wither up and die long before menopause and it features a couple who are in their 50s and 60s. Alas the problems lie not in the movies ideas or casting but in the sitcom-like screenplay employed by writer/director Nancy Meyers and in the inability of the filmmakers to cut the movie down to a reasonable length. Boredom sets in long before the end credits begin to roll. It would be easy to spend a few paragraphs extolling the virtues of the older woman but I shouldnt need to. With age comes not only wisdom but experience. Its often true that a woman of 55 can be a more engaging companion than someone half her age. Hollywood hasnt figured this out which is why a barrier exists somewhere between 30 and 40. For every Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep who continue to be offered substantive roles later in life there are dozens like Michelle Pfeiffer - one-time big names who are largely forgotten. With Somethings Gotta Give it is Meyers intention not merely to rebut this mindset but to openly attack it. Here the tables are turned. The men are after 57-year old Diane Keaton who has both a nude scene and a sex scene - two things that normally dont happen in American films with women over 40. The story opens with 63-year old Harry Langer (Jack Nicholson) pursuing a sexual liaison with the much younger Marin Barry (Amanda Peet). An attempted tryst at the vacation home owned by Marins mother Erica (Keaton) is foiled when Mom shows up along with her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand) at an inappropriate time. The four spend the day together but things end on a sour note when Harry suffers a mild heart attack. Following his hospitalization Harry returns to Ericas house to convalesce but Marin and Zoe go back to the city leaving Erica and Harry alone. The two who initially seem like oil and water develop a connection. They proceed to spend most of the rest of the movie denying what is obvious to everyone in the audience - the confirmed bachelor and emotionally closed-off divorcee are madly in love with one another. The disappointing thing about Somethings Gotta Give is how trite and ordinary the dialogue is. Theres a surprising banality in the way the characters talk to each other and their conversation is littered with the kind of cute artificial language that characterizes sitcom dialogue. There are times when Nicholson and Keaton manage to deliver their lines with more conviction than the words deserve but even they cant always hide how little substance there is in those words. Despite its bold stance on the attributes of older women Somethings Gotta Give is very much a traditional romantic comedy. It follows the formula rigorously meaning that once the characters have initially found each other complications must break them apart. In this case there are two contrivances - Harrys legendary inability to commit and a dashingly handsome male doctor named Julian (Keanu Reeves) who is head-over-heels for Erica. For the better part of an hour the plot labors through an unnecessarily protracted section where Harry and Erica are kept apart. Because Meyers cannot reunite her characters quickly enough the movies running length tops the 2-hour mark - a point at which even the best romantic comedy would threaten to wear out its welcome. Theres obviously an element of self-parody in Jack Nicholsons portrayal of Harry and maybe thats part of the reason his work is so enjoyable. Nicholson is in on the joke and has fun with it. Diane Keaton gives her most lively and open performance since 1993s Manhattan Murder Mystery. Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves (having lightened up now that hes no longer required to be the Chosen One) have exactly the right amount of time as the couples younger attachments. Frances McDormand and Jon Favreau are both underused. One would have thought that given the bloated running length more time could have been spent with them. Somethings Gotta Give will likely be viewed by most audiences as a ""chick flick"" and its probably an apt description. The film will strike its most solid chord with older women who will applaud what Meyers has to say. Like in her previous outing What Women Want she manages to use comedy and romance to get across a message. And despite the weak dialogue there are still some laughs to be had. At the end of this long journey were rooting for Harry and Erica to be together. For the movie to get us to that point regardless of its motives and methods it cant be all bad.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Thats Something Keaton outshines a stellar castBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Somethings Gotta Give is peak Jack Nicholson but Diane Keaton steals the show. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in a scene from the motion picture Somethings Gotta Give. Bob Marshak Columbia Pictures Long (two hours plus) and heavy on dialogue (much of it crackling) Give gives Keaton her best role since 1977s Annie Hall won her an Oscar. And if conveying vulnerability and pain mean anything it may be the role of her career. Keaton looks beyond smashing at 57 -- shell be 58 in January. And Nicholson looks in fighting shape too at least for a character who fears hes suffering a coronary. The comedy begins with Nicholson dating Amanda Peet. Geared for a weekend of forget-the-beach activities at the Hamptons home of her divorced mom (Keaton) the two are surprised when the renowned playwright herself shows up. A group dinner ensues sparked by maternal curiosity over why a rich ladies man of 63 has never married any of the very young women he squires. Nicholson proficiently bandies but its the kind of interrogation that can give a guy a blocked artery. This is just what he suffers sparking a period of recovery back with his unprepared hostess after a young doc (Keanu Reeves) de-clogs the patient. Nicholson and Keaton then get chummier Reeves astonishes her by asking for a date and Keaton leaves herself emotionally exposed just long enough to be crushed when she had assumed she was immune. At this point light entertainment takes on real emotional depth and its enough to carry the picture past the point when the story peaks prematurely. About the movie Somethings Gotta Give 1/2 (out of four) Stars Jack Nicholson Diane Keaton Keanu Reeves Amanda Peet Frances McDormand Director Nancy Meyers Distributor Columbia Rating PG-13 for sexual content brief nudity and some language Opens Friday nationwide Writer/director Nancy Meyers had a big December hit three years ago this week with Mel Gibsons What Women Want. This is a much stronger picture in part because the acting wealth is more keenly distributed -- Reeves (so woeful in this years Matrix debacle) happily included. But lets not mislead about acting gold Without Nicholson and Keaton the movie would be fair. With them its one of the few good romantic comedies this year. What we gotta give is thanks. Keaton is going to get so much laudatory ink that Nicholson may not get enough credit for being so controlled despite many chances to mug. Either he intuitively knows how to play this guy or hes gotten wise guidance from Meyers. Theres a delightful late moment where Nicholson pats Keatons behind in a restaurant which looks like an ad-lib left in. Its just a guess but you sense Nicholson pulled this off all by himself without any direction.

(CNN) -- Sharp witty and deep-down funny ""Somethings Gotta Give"" is one of the best adult romantic comedies of the year -- or the last few years for that matter. Jack Nicholson plays Harry Sanborn a 60-something record executive who only dates women under 30. The lovely Amanda Peet plays Marin Barry Harrys latest conquest. While on a romantic weekend at her familys beach house in the Hamptons on Long Island Marin and Harry are surprised by Marins mother Erica played by Diane Keaton. Deciding to be very adult about the situation they all agree to stay and share the house for the weekend. But their mature plans abruptly change when Harry suffers chest pains during an intimate moment with young Marin. Hes rushed to the hospital where he is treated by a handsome young doctor named Julian Mercer played by Keanu Reeves. (And Reeves in a third-banana role actually pulls this part off quite well.) Julian knowing a good thing when he sees it falls hard for Erica despite the age difference. He also recommends that the only way Harry can be discharged from the hospital is to stay put at Ericas beach house for a few days of rest. The stage is set. Opposites attracting Erica is a divorced woman of a ""certain age"" who is also a successful playwright. Shes accomplished and mature and is -- most of all -- not Harrys type. Not that Erica is panting over Harry either she knows his type and wants nothing to do with this aging lothario. Keanu Reeves vies for Keatons attention in ""Somethings Gotta Give."" Theyre stuck with each other however -- Marin having returned to Manhattan -- and once alone Harry and Erica begin a slow emotional tango as they find they have more in common then theyd ever thought possible. When their barriers begin to collapse Harry panics and goes back to his old tricks with young chicks while Erica succumbs to the young doctors charms. But dont underestimate the power of love between the two -- and the romantic charm of Paris where the film comes to its highly satisfying conclusion. The pairing of Keaton and Nicholson lights up the screen. These two Academy Award-winning actors become a well-oiled machine as they leap and twirl over the hurdles placed in their characters paths. The comedic timing and the sheer skill they display is wonderful. These two veterans make this delightful comedic confection look easy. (It isnt -- as the old saying goes ""Dying is easy comedy is hard."") Believing in love Nicholson appears to be having a wonderful time sending up his own real-life image as a player with younger women. Keaton -- who in real-life has never tied the knot -- is terrific as a woman who dares to believe in the possibility of love after all hope has seemingly died. Director and writer Nancy Meyers who brought us the fine comedy ""What Women Want"" (2000) once again dissects the struggles between the sexes and creates another memorable and thoughtful comedy. This is Meyers first time working with Nicholson but she has had other successful collaborations with Keaton including ""Baby Boom"" (1987) ""Father Of The Bride"" (1991) and ""Father Of The Bride II"" (1995). Keaton and Nicholson worked together in the 1981 drama ""Reds"" directed by their mutual friend Warren Beaty. Perhaps most surprising of all is the performance Meyers gets from Reeves. Easy-going charming relaxed and believable are not descriptions I would give his past work. He has also never played ""the other man"" -- the one who doesnt get the girl -- but Meyers makes it all happen. Reeves has rarely been so appealing. ""Somethings Gotta Give"" is a wonderful antidote to this seasons overwhelming epic-style films. This sparkling comedic gem will fit into everyones stockings. ""Somethings Gotta Give"" opens nationwide on Friday December 12 and is rated PG-13.

Pic panders to the middle-aged women that it ostensibly empowers. Respectable returns should be sustained by adult auds throughout the holiday period. Jokes about impotence menopause and other middle-aged maladies reside where a screenplay ought to live in writer-producer-director Nancy Meyers slapdash Jack Nicholson-Diane Keaton pairing ""Somethings Gotta Give."" Recycling crass stereotypical observations about male-female chemistry that along with the Mel Gibson catnip factor endowed Meyers ""What Women Want"" with major B.O. mojo new pic similarly panders to the very audience (namely middle-aged women) that it ostensibly empowers. Sans Gibson pics commercial prospects look considerably less virile though respectable returns should be sustained by adult auds throughout the holiday period. Harry Sanborn (a particularly disheveled Nicholson) is a record label exec whose predilection for younger femmes precedes him. Really though this is Jack playing ""Jack"" which is to say playing up all those smirking ""Who me?"" mannerisms that Nicholson puts on for the camera when hes seated courtside at a Lakers game. His Harry Sanborn is less of a character turn than an extension of this mildly amusing vaudeville routine. Its also probably the least challenging lead role the actor has had in a late-career resurgence that has seen him do some of his very best work (particularly in ""About Schmidt"" and the little-seen ""The Pledge""). Harrys flame du jour is beautiful Christies auctioneer Marin (the effortlessly sexy Amanda Peet) whose mother Erica Barry (Keaton) is a well-known Broadway playwright -- and judging from her luxurious Hamptons manor an extremely successful one. Harry and Marin arrive at the manor for a relaxing weekend getaway only to discover that Mom and her hippie-feminist sister (Frances McDormand) have already descended on the house. At first both parties feign embarrassment and offer to leave with Erica evidencing particular discomfort at the thought of her daughter dating a man of Harrys age. But eventually its decided that everyone should just stay put. They are after all a bunch of mature intelligent adult human beings. Arent they? Those might be the makings for a classical French farce and thats clearly what Meyers -- who sets and shoots pics finale in Paris and who loads up the soundtrack with lots of Piaf Trenet and Aznavour -- has in mind. Its a different distinctly American brand of comedy however that ""Somethings Gotta Give"" brings to mind. Watching its incessant geriatric pratfalls one thinks of the ""Grumpy Old Men"" pictures in which the likes of Jack Lemmon Ann-Margaret and Sophia Loren were humiliated in the way Nicholson and Keaton are here. The nature of the shenanigans becomes evident fairly early on. When Harry suffers a heart attack during foreplay hes rushed to the hospital and attended to by a young doctor (Keanu Reeves) who takes quite a liking to Erica whose plays hes read. As Erica considers some cradle-robbing of her own Harry shuffles about the hospital with his bare ass protruding prominently from the back of his gown. When Harry is released but ordered to stay in the area for observation he takes up temporary residence as Ericas not-entirely-welcome guest while Marin returns to her life in Manhattan. Its an elaborate set-up for the moment well-sold in pics trailer where Harry accidentally stumbles upon a nude Erica and both of them begin screaming hysterically. The joke being that Harrys never seen a woman of Ericas age in the altogether. Of course as the days pass Harrys proximity to Erica also leads to the inevitable detente between the heretofore bickering housemates. The movies central conceit is that old nugget of psychobabble pseudo-wisdom that says a guy like Harry is an unapologetic skirt-chaser precisely because hes lonely and insecure and secretly yearning for the very monogamy he seems to fear. Erica offered as Meyers idea of an independent-minded modern woman is (much like the women in ""What Women Want"") unflatteringly depicted as a sex-starved nag who plays hard to get but whos really ready to melt in the hands of any guy who still finds her attractive -- be it Jack or Keanu. Its nothing too progressive but at least ""Somethings Gotta Give"" seems prepared about 90 minutes in to end on this note with Harry and Erica ""finding"" each other. But then pic continues for another half-hour needlessly stretching out its already paper-thin plot with all manner of contrivance (including two more near-heart-attacks for Harry) designed to keep the lovers apart. In this seemingly endless fascination with the peccadilloes of New Yorks obscenely wealthy ""Somethings Gotta Give"" bears an at-times uncanny resemblance to the infamous ""Town amp; Country"" which starred an ill-used Keaton alongside Warren Beatty. This time however Keaton delivers a luminous full-bodied star turn that lends pic some much-needed class. Radiantly lit by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus so that she looks her age but in a way that may make others want to accelerate their own aging processes Keaton like Diane Lane in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" creates an emotionally complex character awash in a sea of emotionally vapid material. When Harry in once scene flips through a photo album containing stills of a 70s-era Keaton/Erica one realizes this movie with more intelligent scripting and sensitive direction could have been ""Whatever Happened to Annie Hall?"" Pic looks great with Ballhaus production designer Jon Hutman and costumer Suzanne McCabe vividly capturing the white-linen New York beach community scene. Despite their prominent billing McDormand and ""Elf"" director Jon Favreau (playing Harrys long-suffering assistant) have barely three scenes between them.
