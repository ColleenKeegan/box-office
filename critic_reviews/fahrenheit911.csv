But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

By orchestrating a hype campaign every bit as finely tuned as Mel Gibsons filmmaker Michael Moore has made ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" required viewing not just for the thousands of like-minded activists who have vowed to make the documentary a box office hit this weekend but for anyone who wants to be culturally literate. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hornadaynode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hornaday;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088227773191?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hornadaynode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hornaday;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088227773191?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hornadaynode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hornaday;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088227773192?""></a> In other words most people reading this already know whether theyre going or not. The question is whether ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" will be worth the trip. In many ways this is Moores best film; he exercises restraint that has been notably lacking in such documentaries as ""Roger amp; Me"" ""The Big One"" and the Oscar-winning ""Bowling for Columbine."" In those movies Moore affected the persona of a rumpled Everyman bravely confronting malign corporate and cultural forces; he also never missed a chance to be seen on camera usually in a self-serving pose of righteous indignation. (Who can forget how courageously he placed the photograph of a gun violence victim in Charlton Hestons driveway?) In ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" Moore largely stays out of the picture and the film is the better for it. But otherwise his style hasnt changed. In a freewheeling breathtakingly dense critique of the Bush administration and its reasons for taking the United States into war with Iraq Moore levels the barbed often disarmingly funny attacks that have made him so beloved among his fans. As a documentarian he is less an investigative journalist (not much in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is new) than an essayist seeking to master the satirical brand of overstatement of Jonathan Swift. Moores immodest proposal -- the Bush familys ties to Saudi Arabia have resulted in a number of unsavory deals culminating in the war itself -- may strike viewers as scurrilous or perfectly logical depending on their ideological bent. But couched within the conspiracy theories and bursts of antic absurdist humor are some points about class politics and media that are well worth pondering once the chatter has subsided. Moore swiftly builds his case that not only was the 2000 presidential election stolen but it was only the beginning of efforts by the Bush camp and the right wing in general to consolidate permanent party rule in all three branches of government. When terrorists struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon the filmmaker argues Bush seized the chance to pursue international and domestic policies he had wanted to institute anyway from invading Iraq to reining in civil liberties. Connecting a number of often obscure dots (from Bushs National Guard buddy James Bath to the international investment firm the Carlyle Group) Moore creates a by-turns amusing and damning montage illustrating how in his view oil arms sales greed and will to power have converged in a war whose justifications seem increasingly murky. On a whirlwind tour through Florida Texas the District Fresno Calif. Oregon and his working-class home town of Flint Mich. Moore pauses just long enough to raise troubling questions then moves on. Often those questions are raised in one of Moores signature stunts such as when he hires an ice cream truck to drive around in front of the U.S. Capitol while he reads the Patriot Act over the loudspeaker. (He interviews members of Congress who insist that few if any of their colleagues read it before it passed.) Later he and a U.S. Marine buttonhole pro-war members of Congress and suggest that they urge their children to enlist. ""If youre for the war get behind it"" Moore says. ""Send your own."" Moore often resorts to speculative exaggeration that is either unfair or on point again depending on your point of view. Early in the film he informs the audience that the president spent 42 percent of his tenure before 9/11 on vacation. This sets up a later image of a blank-looking Bush just told that a second plane hit the New York towers and Moores rhetorical question ""Was he thinking he should have come to work more often?"" Throughout ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" the filmmaker misses no chance to make the president look either clueless or arrogant from the unfortunate footage of Bush reading ""My Pet Goat"" during the Sept. 11 attacks to him smirking into the camera just before announcing the invasion of Iraq. Such gleefully cheap shots aside Moore exercises admirable forbearance -- and creates one of the most moving sequences in recent cinema -- when he documents 9/11. Eschewing those indelible visual images of the planes hitting the towers (something he didnt see fit to do in ""Bowling for Columbine"") Moore leaves the screen black offering only the sounds of the planes hitting the screams the chaos and the collapse. The screen then slowly clears into dusty mournful images of the disasters aftermath. It may be Moores finest artistic moment. There are many valuable passages in ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" Moore travels to Iraq -- or has gotten hold of material shot by someone who did -- to interview soldiers about their experience there (not surprisingly they question the war theyre fighting); the film even goes along on a Christmas Eve raid on an Iraqi home. From his use of gruesome images of dead and suffering Iraqis to his stateside visits with some of the thousands of U.S. soldiers who have been injured in the conflict its clear that one of Moores goals is to show costs of war that the Bush administration has kept from view. Going undercover to a conference of military contractors barely able to contain their excitement at cashing in on the Iraq war effort then tagging along as military recruiters cruise a working-class Michigan mall for likely (and usually African American) enlistees Moore makes the contradictions of the war economy graphically real. But hes Michael Moore after all and sometimes he goes too far. His prewar portrait of Iraq as a garden spot of happy families and kids flying kites would no doubt strike thousands of former Iraqi prisoners and their families as risible if not insulting. Most egregious is his treatment of Lila Lipscomb a Flint mother of a dead soldier who tearfully reads his last letter home. Not content with that display Moore follows her to the White House where she breaks down in a fit of tears in a scene that is exploitative and gratuitous. Still such overkill shouldnt obscure her central question ""For what?"" The best thing about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is that viewers can disagree with the filmmakers own assessment that the war was fought for money and power but still emerge with some healthy questions of their own. And questioning authority would seem to be the entire point even when that authority is as vigorous and entertaining a polemicist as Moore himself. Fahrenheit 9/11 (112 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violent and disturbing images and explicit language.

And instead of focusing on Bush and Moore and our complicated feelings toward both of them just for a second lets pay attention instead to someone youve likely never heard of Lila Lipscomb a gentle-voiced citizen of Flint Mich. who proudly unfurls an American flag outside her modest home every day and whose grief gives Moores film its soul. ""My family is what I consider part of the backbone of America"" says Lipscomb quietly. She had long encouraged her children to enter the military (to give them educational and career opportunities she said that she couldnt provide) and deeply resented war protesters. Then her son Michael Pedersen was sent to Iraq and died there. She reads his final letter full of anger and bewilderment against the Iraq war to the camera. Later she stands on the sidewalk in front of the White House a small figure in a sensible pantsuit and sneakers. Her loss suddenly overwhelms her; shes doubled over with sobs as if the pain is somehow pushing her down. Its devastating footage and Moore for once just quietly lets us watch. We also see a brief television clip of the president speaking of the loss of American soldiers in the war overseas. ""It pains me"" says Bush looking -- theres no other way to describe it -- very unpained. Disagree with Moores politics if you must. Disagree with his filmmaking methods if you wish. Nonetheless ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" -- rushed into theaters after its surprise grand-prize win at last months Cannes International Film Festival -- is an often powerful film and the most focused work of the directors career. Its got a bit of his trademark humor and a few of his microphone-shoving stunts but its real story is in Lipscombs eyes. Moore (""Bowling for Columbine"" ""Roger amp; Me"") has his fair share of detractors and hes earned them -- his films have been known to play tiddlywinks with the facts and hes got an unfortunate tendency to center his films on his own outsize personality and to mock the very ""regular Americans"" with whom he aligns himself. (Parts of ""Roger amp; Me"" are downright cruel.) But he knows how to connect with an audiences righteous anger. Like his previous films Moore here takes a large subject -- George W. Bush and his administration with special focus on the events following the Sept. 11 terror attacks -- and tackles it from all directions loosely connecting it all by his own folksy voice-over. While his previous films used Moores own exploits as a framing device ""Fahrenheit"" puts Bush at its center and takes aim with an arsenal of weaponry thats scathing. Its a documentary with a very specific point of view; propaganda if you will -- Moore clearly made this election-year film in the hopes that it would encourage voters to boot Bush from office. His film isnt remotely impartial and doesnt claim to be. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" a documentary written and directed by Michael Moore. 116 minutes. Rated R for violent and disturbing images and for language. Several theaters. But Moore isnt alone with his opinions here -- the film uses interviews with various political figures (including U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott D-Seattle who speaks of the ""climate of fear"" created by the Bush administration) and published reports from newspapers such as The Washington Post and New York Times to back up its charges. Among the most devastating financial connections between the families of Bush and Osama bin Laden intricately detailed. Its not new -- Craig Ungers book ""House of Bush House of Saud"" published earlier this year examines the relationship -- and Moore never is entirely clear about the point hes making but it shows an alarming pattern of interdependency. And while the heart-wrenching footage of Lipscomb is among the films most memorable theres another image that stands in stark startling contrast. As the planes hit the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 George W. Bush was reading to a grade-school class in Florida. An aide murmured in his ear the news of the first crash -- and then a few moments later of the second. Caught on video footage Bush doesnt react. He continues reading to the kids as the long minutes tick by his face impassive. You can almost see him getting smaller as time passes. Its highly unlikely that lives would have been saved that day if Bush had leapt from his chair into immediate action. And we dont know what was going on behind that stony face -- perhaps he was simply trying to forestall panic. But as you watch the footage you cant help but wonder Is he waiting to be told what to do? And in absence of instructions is he incapable of decision? What kind of lesson is he giving those children? Is this how we want a president to act? How you respond to ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" will of course have much to do with your own political persuasion -- those already convinced of the wrongs of the Bush administration will enter the theater ready to embrace the film; those opposed likely wont see it at all. But in any case the film will make you angry and youll leave the theater wanting to talk to argue to do something. The faces of Lipscomb and a Sept. 11 widow and a dead baby tossed into a pickup truck in the aftermath of an Iraq bombing still haunt me and will haunt you. Moore in his in-your-face way has clearly lit a fire; itll be fascinating to see what remains when the burning subsides.

Its also Michael Moores best film. 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Fahrenheit 911 Documentary. Directed by Michael Moore. (R. 125 minutes. Opens Friday at Bay Area theaters.) The big moment in Michael Moores ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" comes midway through the documentary and theres no mistaking it Its the morning of Sept. 11 2001 and the president of the United States is sitting in a little chair in a Florida classroom. His chief of staff enters and whispers in his ear that the country is under attack. And President George W. Bush just sits there for seven long minutes. In a forceful documentary devoted to puncturing the image of the president as a take-charge leader this will be for many the tipping point. At the very least it will be the scene that everyone talks about. Moore doesnt show the whole seven minutes. Instead he lingers on the scene just long enough for the audience to daydream of Eisenhower Reagan Truman Bush senior Clinton Nixon or Kennedy in that situation and to imagine any one of them standing immediately excusing himself and demanding to be put in touch with his national security team. Related Stories George Bush on the hot seat in 9/11 / Michael Moores documentary takes on president Assessing the merits of a political film is a tricky business. Obviously its quality is partly a function of its power to persuade but its persuasiveness is in the eye of the beholder. Yet there are other things to consider The movies passion. Its serious purpose. Its tone. Its mix of words and images and the way both linger in the mind. Theres the way the movie fashions its arguments and the cumulative effect the experience provides -- what you feel walking out what you think about the next day. By all these measures ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is Michael Moores best film. Certainly its a career landmark the film that signals his transition from political entertainer to political thinker from propagandist to idiosyncratic journalist from colorful gadfly to patriot. If ""Bowling for Columbine"" was a step this is a leap in which Moore vaults past Will Rogers into some territory all his own. In the 90-year history of the American feature film there has never been a popular election-year documentary like this one. The film which won the Palme dOr at this years Cannes Film Festival has a single unifying idea that brings together its various elements. The idea is an emotional one namely that America has been living in a kind of nightmare for the last few years one that began not with the events of Sept. 11 2001 but from the moment that the networks took Florida out of the Gore column on election night 2000. Moore posits that the main source of Americas nightmare has been the presidency of George W. Bush. Theres anger at the core of Moores position but he never shows it. And while he sprinkles the film with his deadpan humor for the most part he plays it straight laying down facts methodically trusting in the audiences interest and attention. The connection between the Bush family and the bin Laden familys oil interests dominates the first section of the film. Although Moore doesnt uncover anything sinister the sheer extent of this personal and financial connection comes as a surprise and it fuels Moores outrage that the bin Laden family was allowed to leave the United States without interrogation following Sept. 11. That Moore is becoming an artist is evident in the way he depicts the World Trade Center attacks. Instead of going to stock news footage he blacks out the screen and makes us listen to the sounds of Lower Manhattan on the horrible day. It brings it all back. From there Moore challenges the presidents handling of the war on terror by bringing in experts to say that the Afghanistan war was ""botched"" that too few troops were sent. He details lapses in homeland security. To bolster his case that the administration has fostered a culture of fear he goes to a tiny town in Virginia and talks to citizens on the lookout for terrorists. When asked what the terrorists might want to bomb several locals say ""The Wal-Mart."" Moore had a camera on the ground in Iraq and the footage he got is like nothing seen on American television. A woman sobs and screams that her familys house has been destroyed. American soldiers clown around near hooded detainees while other soldiers express doubt about the mission. Moores effects are manipulative in the best sense -- even though the audience knows what hes up to the moments still have power. As the president talks about the need for war Moore shows kids playing in Baghdad. Later he shows a boy lying in the street with his forearm barely attached to his body. On the home front Moore shows a mother whose son was killed in Iraq reading her sons final letter -- in which he says that he hopes the president isnt re- elected. Moore is playing for keeps. The somber tone notwithstanding this film is on fire. Its an exhausting shattering thing to watch and the mood it casts lasts for days. What both exalts the experience and grounds the picture is Moores essentially patriotic faith that a sincere invested argument can get a hearing in America. To see ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and experience its passion is to wonder why there havent been popular political films like this since movies began and from all points of view. It seems like such a reasonable use of cinema and an inexpressibly worthy one. -- Advisory This film contains strong language gun violence and scenes of carnage.

It also is some things you havent heard which is what makes it worth watching. MIchael Moore pays a visit to the Saudi embassy compound in Fahrenheit 9/11. Were guessing he didnt get in. Lions Gate Films Of course its strong point of view in an increasingly polarized nation will draw both ardent support and virulent opposition. But no moviegoer will be bored. The documentarys scathing attack on the war in Iraq and George W. Bushs presidency is informative provocative frightening compelling funny manipulative and most of all entertaining. Much of what filmmaker Michael Moore focuses on has been covered in news reports magazine articles and books. But because he still manages to present new data and little-seen footage connecting the dots in a cogent and persuasive way Fahrenheit 9/11 is the years must-see film. Few will forget the devastating footage of Bushs bewildered dumbstruck reaction on the morning of Sept. 11 2001 when he learns of the attack on the World Trade Center. Instead of conferring with advisers he sits quietly in a Florida classroom for an interminable seven minutes and then reads My Pet Goat to the children. Among the most powerful moments interviews with once gung-ho military personnel now uncertain about their Iraqi mission. A segment with a grieving mother whose son was killed in the war could appear calculated. But she is a willing participant in her own exploitation choosing to share her pain in service of a broader message the inhumanity of the war. Fahrenheits graphic war footage may work more on our emotions than our intellect but that doesnt make the film propaganda. The stickier part is Moores depiction of Bush as unscrupulous and self-serving. The first President Bush has branded the film a ""vicious personal attack"" on his son. If any of Moores facts prove wrong then perhaps hell have a point. But most of Fahrenheits information comes from verifiable sources. Some of the disparagement seems personal because Moore presents information with his trademark deadpan humor. But is it an attack to point out that the President spent 42% of his first eight months in office on vacation? Or is it useful information for voters? Whether the film will change peoples minds or unseat the president is debatable. What it might do is influence those few still on the fence; what it will do is reinforce the position of those who are anti-Bush. (Opens today in New York and Washington D.C. and nationwide Friday.

"Fahrenheit 9/11 superior propaganda. Slate Sign In Sign Up Fahrenheit 9/11 superior propaganda. Fahrenheit 9/11 superior propaganda. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 24 2004 700 PM Proper Propaganda Michael Moores Fahrenheit 9/11 is unfair and outrageous. You got a problem with that? By David Edelstein 9/11 Bias and bullying for a good cause Back in the 80s--the era of Reagan and Bush 41 when milquetoasts Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis were the ineffectual Democratic candidates and Jimmy Carter was off building houses for poor people when Anthony Lewis was writing oh-so-temperately in the New York Times which was then leaning neoconward under the stewardship of Abe Rosenthal when there was an explosion of dirty Republican tricksters like Lee Atwater and trash-talking right-wingers from Morton Downey Jr. to the fledgling Rush Limbaugh--I found myself wishing wishing fervidly for a blowhard whom the left could call its own. Someone who wouldnt shrink before the rights bellicosity. Someone who would bellow back mock unashamedly and maybe even recapture the prankster spirit of counterculture figures like Abbie Hoffman. Yeah I know Be careful what you wish for. Advertisement In 20 years of writing about film no movie has ever tied me up in knots the way Michael Moores Fahrenheit9/11 (Lions Gate) has. It delighted me; it disgusted me. I celebrate it; I lament it. Im sure of only one thing that I dont trust anyone--pro or con--who doesnt feel a twinge of doubt about his or her responses. What follows might be broadly labeled as ""waffling"" but I hope at least that it is bold and decisive waffling. Needless to say Fahrenheit 9/11 never waffles. The liberals The Passion ofthe Christ it ascribes only the most venal motives to the other side. There is no sign in the filmmaker of an openness to other interpretations (or worldviews). This is not quite a documentary--which I define very loosely as a work in which the director begins by turning on the camera and allowing the reality to speak for itself aware of its complexities contradictions and multitudes. You are with Moore or you are a war criminal. The film is part prosecutorial brief and part (as A.O. Scott has noted) rabid editorial cartoon a blend of insight outrage and sniggering innuendo the whole package threaded (and tied in a bow) with cheap shots some of them voiced by Moore some created in the editing room by intercutting stilted images from old movies. Moore is largely off-screen (no pun intended) but as narrator hes always there sneering and tsk-tsking. Here are the salient points that Bush stole the presidency from Al Gore (who in one of the films best scenes must certify his opponents election and quell a movement to stall that certification); that Bush and his family had been in bed with the Saudis which made him less responsive to the danger of al-Qaida terrorism; that a pipeline in Afghanistan promised billions if the Taliban was on board which was one reason that the threat of Osama Bin Laden (black sheep of a family with whom daddy did business) was swept under the rug. Better to concentrate on Iraq the administration felt--it had unfinished Saddam business it was rich in oil and it was a potential goldmine for U.S. corporations. Moore ranges far and wide He apes Apocalypse Now (1979) with footage of bucolic Baghdad before the bombings then cuts to soldiers explaining the way they hook their iPods to the tank speakers ""You have a good song playing in the background it gets you really fired up."" (Im surprised he didnt go ahead and play ""Ride of the Valkyries."") Then theres graphic footage of dead Iraqi women and small children killed in what the Pentagon said were surgically precise bombings. A grieving old woman shrieks curses at the United States while U.S. soldiers with missing limbs rail at the administration. On the home front Moore suggests that the Patriot Act was unread by the legislators who passed it and harps on its absurd applications like the agent who infiltrated a septuagenarian cookie-baking peace collective in Fresno Calif. Then he chases hawkish congressmen outside the Capitol. Would they send their own sons and daughters to fight in Iraq? he asks--often to their backs as they flee. Advertisement As I watched California Congressman John T. Doolittle take off from Moores camera arms and legs bobbing spastically I was troubled by the cheapness of Moores interviewing techniques. But I laughed my ass off anyway. And I felt better about laughing when I checked the warlike congressmans Web site which mentions his graduation from high school  in 1968 but predictably no Vietnam service. All right you can make anyone into a goofball with a selection of unflattering shots and out-of-context quotations but it is so very easy to make George W. Bush--with his near-demonic blend of smugness and vacuity--look bad. Or is this in eye of the beholder? Perhaps when Bush speaks of hunting down terrorists then gets down to the real golfing business--""Stop these terrorist killers. Thank you. Now watch this drive""--you see an honest plainspoken leader unfairly ridiculed. But what can even Bush partisans make of those seven minutes in the elementary school classroom after he received the news that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center and the nation was under attack? In one of the few lapses in an otherwise virtuoso rant Christopher Hitchens argues that Moore would have made sport of a martial Russell Crowe-like response. Nice try but that blow wouldnt have landed and this one does spectacularly. It is downright spooky to watch the nominal commander in chief and ""leader of the free world"" behave in a moment of crisis like a superfluous man. Moore is best when he doesnt stage dumb pranks (like broadcasting the Patriot Act in D.C. out of an ice-cream truck) but provokes with his mere presence. When he interviews the author of House of Bush House of Saud in front of the Saudi embassy and the Secret Service shows up to ask what hes doing its a gotcha moment Whats the Secret Service doing protecting non-U.S. government officials? He has a light touch there thats missing from the rest of the Fahrenheit 9/11. In one scene his camera homes in on a Flint Mich. woman weeping over a son killed in Iraq and the effect is vampirish. After the screening a friend railed that Moore was exploiting a mothers grief. When I suggested that the scene made moral sense in the context of the directors universe that the exploitation is justified if it saves the lives of other mothers sons my friend said ""When did you become a relativist?"" Im troubled by that charge--and by the fact that we nearly came to blows by the end of the conversation. But when it comes to politics in a time of war I think that relativism is well relative. Fahrenheit 9/11 must be viewed in the context of the Iraq occupation and the torrent of misleading claims that got us there. It must be viewed in the context of Rush Limbaugh repeating the charge that Hillary Clinton had Vince Foster murdered in Fort Marcy Park or laughing off the exposure of Valerie Plame when had this been a Democratic administration hed be calling every day for the traitors head. It must be viewed in the context of Ann Coulter calling for the execution of people who disagree with her. It must be viewed in the context of another new documentary the superb The Hunting of the President that documents--irrefutably--the lengths to which the right went to destroy Bill Clinton. Moore might be a demagogue but never--not even during Watergate--has a U.S. administration left itself so open to this kind of savaging. Along with many other polite liberals I cringed last year when Moore launched into his charmless pugilistic acceptance speech at the Academy Awards. Oh how vulgar I thought--couldnt he at least have been funny? A year later I think I might have been too hard on the fat prick. Six months before her death in 1965 the great novelist Dawn Powell wrestled in her diary with the unseemliness of political speech during an ""artistic"" event ""Lewis Mumford gave jolt to the occasion and I realized I had gotten as chicken as the rest of America because what he said--we had no more right in Vietnam than Russia had in Cuba--was true but I did not think he should use his position to declaim this. Later I saw the only way to accomplish anything is by abusing your power."" Exactly. Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a documentary for the ages it is an act of counterpropaganda that has a boorish bullying force. It is all in all a legitimate abuse of power. Addendum June 25 2004 It is now apparently part of the Secret Services mandate to protect foreign diplomats in the nations capital. Why theyd have dispatched an agent to quiz Michael Moore on camera is a mystery though. They knew who he was. Did Prince Bandar just want to let him know he was being monitored? CorrectionJune 25 2004 An earlier version of this piece incorrectly stated that U.S. Rep. John T. Doolittle graduated college in 1968. He graduated high school that year.

(CNN) -- Filmmaker Michael Moore tends to make his points with a sledgehammer and his anti-Bush administration documentary ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is no exception. But this time around he uses more delicate instruments as well and what emerges is a powerful film.Documentarians always have their own points of view but Moore takes his positions and then guards them with pitbull-like intensity (though with humor as well). That tendency was plain in such past efforts as ""Roger and Me"" and the Academy Award-winning ""Bowling For Columbine."" ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" takes his burning passion to new heights; the heat is downright tangible.But the question isnt whether ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a fair and balanced look at its subject matter. Of course it isnt. Rather is it good filmmaking? The answer is yes. Moore states his premise and then proceeds to build his case quite effectively. The title is a play on ""Fahrenheit 451"" the temperature at which paper burns and a Ray Bradbury novel about a future totalitarian state in which reading and independent thought are banned. Moores contention is that the present administration in Washington is jamming its policies down the throats of Americans -- and the world -- with little to no regard for the truth; or at the very least no room for an open discussion as to the validity of those policies.Showing restraintMoore is going for the jugular in this one-man cinematic crusade. However he does show remarkable -- and I feel wise -- restraint when it comes to the actual events of September 11 2001. Rather than featuring grisly images of the World Trade Center collapsing he lets the screen go dark relying on sound to convey the horror of the event. But when it comes to Bush himself the gloves are off and the fists are clenched.Perhaps the most damaging footage shows Bush on September 11 sitting in a Florida classroom for a full seven minutes after he had been told that the second tower had been struck and that it was clear the horrific events in New York were a terrorist attack not a tragic accident. Moore lets this moment go on and on The president of the United States stone-faced in front of dozens of schoolchildren doing absolutely nothing as our nation comes under attack.Though Moore is the narrator of ""Fahrenheit"" and appears in the movie much of the film consists of news footage featuring the president. At times it can be argued some of these scenes appear out of context. In one scene Bush addresses supporters at a white-tie fundraiser ""This is an impressive crowd -- the haves ... and the have-mores. Some people call you the elite; I call you my base."" In another moment Bush is in the middle of a golf game when he gives an obviously impromptu news conference. ""I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers"" he says. ""Now watch this drive."" He then proceeds to step back and hit the golf ball. Powerful sequences On September 11 President Bush reads ""My Pet Goat"" to a group of Florida schoolchildren.But the film finds stunning power in the story of Lila Lipscomb a resident of Moores hometown of Flint Michigan. Her son is fighting in Iraq; when she is first interviewed shes a staunch defender of the war and Bushs policies. But then her son is killed. After his death she goes through a poignant and deep metamorphosis and becomes staunchly anti-Bush and anti-war.Whether ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" will have an impact beyond its cinematic achievement only time will tell. But that doesnt diminish the film. Its an accomplished documentary with an extremely powerful message.

In fact the film which has little in the way of fresh dirt on Bush or his governments lousy record at home and abroad is Michael Moores most sober film yet. Thats not saying much Fahrenheit 9/11 is still a roaring and for the most part richly deserved hatchet job on the Bush presidency. Its also a bid to recapture patriotism from the conservatives and enshrine it as a left virtue largely by paying its respects to the dispossessed Americans who are staffing a war they dont understand and increasingly dont want to wage. Whether these same Americans will go to see Fahrenheit 9/11 remains an open question. Juiced by the success of Bowling for Columbine the hungry distributors of Moores new film (Lions Gate Films IFC Films and something called the Fellowship Adventure Group which sounds like a Quaker scouting organization) plan to open the movie on hundreds of screens across the country surely a first for any documentary. If thats what you want to call Fahrenheit 9/11. Whether you see the movie as a persuasive alterna-history of recent Republican government or a crude demolition job on Bush -- its both in spades -- will depend as much on what you think nonfiction film is supposed to do as it will on your political affiliations. The reporting is hardly new. Youd have to be hopelessly out of the loop not to have heard about the unholy business ties between the Bushes and those ""lovely human beings"" (as a Saudi friend of the Bushes calls them in the movie) the bin Ladens. (Its right there in Moores most recent book Dude Wheres My Country? though it wasnt he who broke the story but the Boston Globe.) Or about the governments pre-9/11 failure to attend to evidence of a coming attack on the United States by al Qaeda. Or about its milking of post-9/11 public fears to create a bogus not to say incompetent war on terror which according to Moore was designed to soften up the public for a coming war with Iraq. Moore is too savvy a media wrangler not to realize that most news dates in five minutes these days. But hes a master cutter and paster of other peoples images to suit his own ends. (Perhaps thats what Quentin Tarantino was referring to when handing Moore the Palme dOr at Cannes he found it necessary to stress that Fahrenheit 9/11 won for good filmmaking not for its politics.) And hes a very funny guy which is why he gets 6 million to make his movies while the growing numbers of other lefty political documentarians labor on with their video cameras and their 2000 budgets. But even as youre laughing you get the uncomfortable sense youre being recruited and not always honestly to Moores us-and-them point of view. So while it is enormously entertaining to watch footage of the idiotic gizmos (among them a man-size safe and a miniparachute that lets you leap 10 stories and more in the attempt to save yourself from dark-skinned predators) invented by entrepreneurial wannabes to capitalize on the war on terror or the lone state trooper assigned to protect several hundred miles of vulnerable Oregon coastline from terrorists you also remember just how anxious you really felt after September 11. Likewise it is fun to see Paul Wolfowitz spit on his comb before raking it though his hair or Bush fidgeting irritably under a television makeup persons fussing though in mid-yuk you almost forget to ask what that tells you about the way either man does his job. Moore does some useful if hardly new skewering of the gap between Bushs words and his policies among them his fulsome praise for ""our boys in Iraq"" even as he recommends cuts in the pay of combat soldiers and assistance to their families. But Moore has never been good at drawing the line between political critique and personal attack -- or worse he recognizes it and presses on regardless. Those of us who are driven up the wall by Bushs frat-boy humor by the disingenuous folksiness with which he dispenses meaningless bromides in his speeches or who were nauseated by the cowboy swagger of his landing on that aircraft carrier may get a big kick out of seeing him ridiculed but we may end up feeling bought. Its in his lampooning of Bush the man that Moore is at his most effective -- and also at his cheapest. More than once Moore shows us Bushs face in close-up on September 11 as preparing to read My Pet Goat to a group of inner-city elementary schoolers he tries to absorb the news of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Beady eyes swiveling in agitation he gazes vacantly around the room for several minutes then starts reading to the kids. In his softly insinuating voice-over Moore reads the scene for us as a classic case of Bush being unable to function without a script. It is just as likely that like the rest of us on hearing those first reports the man was in total shock. And what Moore fails to tell us is that even some on the left admired the way Bush handled himself in the days after the disaster. The president may have shifty eyes and an unhelpful way with syntax but that in itself doesnt make him an idiot. In the current issue of The Atlantic James Fallows argues that Bush began his political career with substantial debating skills and that although they seem to have gone AWOL while hes been in office he may yet give John Kerry a run for his money in the presidential debates. Certainly he gives Moore a run in Fahrenheit 9/11. When the filmmaker shouts out a question across a crowded room Bush yells back affably ""Behave yourself. And get a real job.""

Sep. 13 600pm For better and worse Moore is a simplifier who extracts both heavy irony and heavy tragedy from the juxtaposition of unrelated images. Perhaps in response to critical distaste for his emotionally manipulative style Moore has scaled back his own presence in Fahrenheit 9/11 and mostly for the better. Hes still there guiding our responses in voice-over. But the stunts aimed at embarrassing the rich and powerful or educating the poor and dispossessed are few and far between. We see him being hassled by the Secret Service just for hanging around the Saudi Embassy then outside the Capitol as he hassles bemused congressmen to sign up their own sons for service in Iraq. When it comes to ordinary people Moore has always been something of an emotional terrorist a practitioner of what Saul Bellow calls ""potato love"" -- smothering people you barely know with pseudo-intimacy and flattery until you have them eating out of your hand. In Moores earlier films when you saw that big protective paw settle around the shoulders of an unsuspecting regular Joe you knew some serious psychological pressure was about to come down. In Fahrenheit 9/11 Moore holds back and properly so. Back home in chronically unemployed Flint Michigan he finds Lila Lipscomb a self-styled conservative Democrat who sent all her kids to the military and then after the death of one of her sons in Iraq became disenchanted with the war. In some of the movies most genuinely affective moments Moore tactfully remains off camera and allows this passionate highly articulate woman to speak for herself. Hes not quite so hands-off with the imagery of war. Moore shows us a pre-war Baghdad of kids playing in the streets and smiling men eating in sidewalk cafes -- I guess it was harder to get footage of the thousands who disappeared into Saddam Husseins torture chambers -- and of Iraq now with wounded children screaming in pain from the ruins of their bombed houses. He shows us U.S. soldiers conducting humiliating house-to-house searches (""Immoral behavior begets immoral behavior"" Moore intones fingering their superiors in Washington lest we blame the proletarian grunts themselves) and being carried away wounded themselves. ""And for what?"" someone asks rhetorically. Well yes. As I write evidence is pouring out of the 9/11 Commission report that in terms of the official reasons for which it was waged -- the famous disappearing WMDs Husseins alleged ties to al Qaeda and his alleged plot to attack the United States -- the invasion of Iraq has been an unqualified disaster. Moore though wants us to see the mere existence of casualties as proof that the war is illegitimate. Would he take the same approach for casualties of World War II? Or more pertinently a war waged on Iraq for the purposes of freeing the country of a despot with the blood of hundreds of thousands of his own citizens on his hands? The awful truth is that every war has its dead and dying but we are still obliged to distinguish between wars that are morally justified and those that are not. It is not intrinsically right-wing to believe that powerful nations have a duty to help free weaker ones from internal tyranny. Moore is right -- though he is hardly the first to say it -- that thats not primarily why Bush went into this war. But the director has boxed himself into arguing that the invasion of Iraq was wrong on any grounds which sounds suspiciously like isolationism a problematic position for any leftist with a sense of responsibility to the world beyond his own borders.    Moore has made no secret of his ambitions for Fahrenheit 9/11. He wants the movie to shift the public into voting Bush out of the White House. That may be as grandiose as his hiring of a killer consulting firm to counter any attacks on the movie from the right. (Right now theres little Moore cant take care of on his bellicose lonesome unless you count Bush Senior who gets trashed in the movie and has called him a ""slimeball"" for tarnishing his sons image or a cranky Ray Bradbury who cussed out the filmmaker for stealing the title of his novel Fahrenheit 451 and then changing it without permission.) Movies tend not to topple regimes however unsavory. Still Fahrenheit 9/11 may yet accomplish a more modest if no less salutary goal -- severing the thin membrane that binds Harvey Weinstein who initially bought the film to Disney who unloaded it and in the ensuing bother all but engineered a smash hit.

"Fahrenheit 9/11 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fahrenheit-9-11 ) Fahrenheit 9/11 (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli The primary goal of Fahrenheit 9/11 is obvious offer evidence that President George W. Bush is an incompetent moron and that his administration is corrupt. One might argue that filmmaker Michael Moore does an adequate job of this except that to anyone who follows politics theres nothing new about those charges. Bush has often shown that as president hes in over his head. He has never hidden his lack of intelligence. (How else to explain his constant mispronunciation of ""nuclear"" as ""nucular?"") And corruption goes along with politics like peppermint canes go with Christmas trees. One expects more from Moore than the mere regurgitation of well-documented material. We want insight not surface-skimming. The Supreme Court decided the 2000 election? We know that. Bin Ladens family members were flown out of the United States at a time when planes were grounded? That has been reported in magazines and papers and is general knowledge. Theres strong evidence of a financial connection between Bin Ladens family and Bush? We first heard about that shortly after 9/11. Bushs real goal in the so-called ""War on Terrorism"" was to force a regime change in Iraq? No surprise. The real problem with Fahrenheit 9/11 isnt that it attacks the current Republican administration (which could be seen as a public service) but that it does so clumsily and with poor focus. Moore does much of his preaching with a paucity of facts relying on circumstantial evidence and insinuation to make his points. And too little of his information is fresh. As flawed as Bowling for Columbine might have been it was challenging and thought-provoking. It provided opportunities for debates and dialogue about gun control and school violence. Fahrenheit 9/11 offers little more than a repetitive two-hour attack on Bush. Its not compelling; in fact there are times when its not especially interesting. I went into this movie expecting to be engaged. I left it bemoaning the fact that I had spent 11.50 on parking. Three segments redeem Fahrenheit 9/11 allowing it to claim to be more than just a list of anti-Bush charges. The first is the videotaped footage of Bush in Floridas Booker Elementary School reading ""My Pet Goat"" for seven minutes after the second plane crashed into the World Trade Center. His face is a mask of bewilderment and indecision. Its clear that he has no idea what to do next and he is waiting for one of his advisors to make a suggestion. Its not the portrait of a man any sane American would want in command. Later Moore spends some time discussing how the seemingly-random changes in the multi-colored terror alert are used to manipulate peoples panic. Its a worthwhile subject that gets short-shrift because the director is keen to move on to something else. Finally there are a series of interviews with Lila Lipscomb whose son died in Iraq. Moore first films her when Michael is still alive and shes a staunch patriot. Later he returns so she can recount how her son died. She reads the final letter he sent to her and makes a cathartic trek to Washington D.C. to see the White House and curse the man living inside. Its poignant material but Moores reputation robs this portion of his film of its potential power. Because we dont know how much of this is real. Maybe it all is. Maybe Moore had the good fortune to interview this particular woman while her son was still alive so he could capture her radical shift of allegiance afterwards. But his past argues that he might not be playing things straight. Moore has a longstanding history of manipulating the truth and we have no way of assessing whether any doctoring has been done with the Lipscomb interviews. With another filmmaker such as Errol Morris we wouldnt question whats on screen. But Moores reputation demands that we regard everything in his films with a healthy portion of skepticism. I was moved by the Lipscomb interviews but a part of me didnt know whether to accept them as they are. Moore has never been a cinematic marksman but there has always been a sense that hes shooting at a well-defined target. Thats not the case here. Fahrenheit 9/11 represents a barrage with ammunition flying in all directions. The philosophy seems to be expend enough bullets and youll strike something. The movie jumps all over the place with Moore scoring occasional hits but never building the kind of damning case he is hoping for. Maybe the movie isnt long enough. Or maybe he didnt have access to enough material. Or maybe he was in such a rush to get this thing into the marketplace that he didnt care how inelegantly it was put together. With Fahrenheit 9/11 Moore has toned down both his sarcastic comedy and his ego-driven penchant for being constantly on-screen. There are still moments of inspired humor such as the caustic use of ""The Magnificent Seven"" theme and old Western clips to lampoon the attack on Afghanistan. And Moore is never far away from the cameras lens. He makes a few appearances including a typical instance of grandstanding (when he tries to get members of Congress to sign up their children to serve in Iraq) but the narrative is delivered in his voice. He shows restraint and sensitivity when depicting the events of 9/11/01. We hear the audio while watching a black screen then see a collage of reactions. We are not shown images of planes crashing into buildings. Those arent necessary because they are already burned into our memories. Having now seen Fahrenheit 9/11 I wonder about the controversy. The movie isnt skilled enough or incisive enough to represent a cause for concern. Democrats will embrace it and Republicans will revile it and although the extremity of neither reaction is warranted both are expected. But Fahrenheit 9/11 lacks the power to impact the huge block of undecided voters and it is hubris on the parts of the filmmakers and distributors (both past and present) to believe such a thing. Considering the makeup of the festival jury the Golden Palm win at Cannes is explicable if not justifiable. The wave of publicity accompanying the release will draw audiences and inflate first weekend numbers. For Moore and those who have money invested in this project thats a good thing because this is not the kind of movie capable of attracting viewers on merit.

"Fahrenheit 9/11 Turns Up the Heat washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Fahrenheit 9/11 Turns Up the Heat Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 25 2004 ""FAHRENHEIT 9/11"" is a guided missile aimed directly at the presidency of George W. Bush just four months ahead of the national election. Its political purpose is unequivocal. But heres the part that matters Its trajectory is guided with pinpoint accuracy. With an ironic narrative that takes us from the Florida debacle that decided the 2000 presidential election to the political nettling aftermath of war in Iraq ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" sagely uses the public record the facts and the presidents goofiest statements and on-camera performances to score its points. Documentaries arent news articles; theyre subjective points of view which is why Moore has almost endless fun at the presidents expense. (Attorney General John Ashcroft gets his share of ridicule too.) ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" obviously skews facts to its own advantage but thats what the game is all about. What counts is the emotional power of Moores persuasion. With a combination of events and facts that we have already learned and some that we havent Moore puts it all together. You can understand the thread of his argument even if you disagree. Whats remarkable too is Moores departure from his usual obnoxious bluster. This is the first film from Moore where you dont think about the shrillness of his sanctimony so much as the urgency of his outrage. He lets the documentary speak for itself a radical strategy for a man best known for megaphone-toting rantings and candid-camera-style stunts. What are the movies points? It accuses the president and his inner circle (including James Baker and financial adviser James R. Bath) of being so financially and personally connected to friends in high Saudi Arabian places they were too compromised to take decisive action against Osama bin Laden. The film also claims that after planes struck the World Trade Center in 2001 and there was a moratorium on all commercial flights around the country the Bush administration helped many members of the wealthy bin Laden family evacuate the country -- by plane. The strong implication is that these evacuations were performed during the flight ban. This may be the films iffiest moment in terms of accuracy but theres no easy way to verify or discredit this. If it is indeed true its an explosive revelation. The director makes many more of his points in dramatic emotional ways. He documents for instance how the president was busier practicing his golf swing and clearing brush than paying attention to terrorist threats before Sept. 11 2001. He opines that the color codes that we have learned to live by -- the red and orange alerts that indicate the severity of a terrorism risk -- were part of a strategy to petrify the nation into support for an Iraq invasion. In one of the most stunning scenes we watch the president attending an elementary school class on that ill-fated morning. An aide whispers to him news of the plane crash into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The look on Bushs face is stunned as any persons would be. A clock ticks away. The president looks as though hell never get up from that seat. The minutes tick by. ""Was he wondering if he should have shown up to work more often?"" Moore says in voice-over. The president stares at the childrens book hes holding. Its called ""My Pet Goat."" This would seem to be mere partisan tomato-hurling if we hadnt just observed the previous scene the attack on Manhattan. For that devastating event Moore shows only a black screen. We hear the buzzing of the aircraft. We know whats coming. We hear the impact and a second later the agonized cries and gasps of the witnesses. Then comes the second crash. Only then does Moore cut to the faces of those watching. A tearful woman cries out to God to save the souls of those leaping from the windows. Another devastated sits down on the sidewalk. We dont see the jumpers. But we feel we do. And it makes watching the ""My Pet Goat"" scene more disturbing than funny. If there was any movie to affect the political middle -- those rare Americans who come to each presidential election without a pre-existing opinion -- this may be it. There are startling scenes during the American invasion of Iraq that include the visceral terror of a household in Baghdad as young American soldiers break in to arrest someone; and the candid testimony of U.S. troops who express their disgust at the situation there. Perhaps most persuasive of all is the dramatic turnaround experienced by Lila Lipscomb a Michigan mother. She changes from patriotic support for the Bush administration to heartbroken despair after she loses a son to the war. In one of the films most affecting moments Lipscomb finds herself facing an Iraqi woman who sits before cardboard placards protesting the war on Lafayette Square right in front of the White House. Two people on opposing sides suddenly find themselves experiencing common ground. Moments like this mark ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" as a potential cultural juggernaut -- a film for these troubling times.

Bush who told the muckraker ""Behave yourself will ya? Go find real work."" Moore has made trouble for so many powerful people he has become a media power of his own. He can even make celebrities of mere movie reviewers When his latest cinematic incendiary device ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" had its first press screening Monday morning American critics emerging from the theater were besieged by a convoy of TV and radio crews from networks around the world who wanted to know what they thought of Moores blast at the Bush Administration. Disney for one was not impressed. Earlier this month the company ordered its subsidiary Miramax Films not to release the film. Moore says that his lawyer was told by Disney CEO Michael Eisner that distributing it would harm the companys negotiations for favorable treatment for its Florida theme parks from that states governor one Jeb Bush. Harvey Weinstein co-chair of Miramax is now trying to buy the film back from Disney and to fashion his own coalition of the willing -- other distributors happy to profit from Disneys timidity. The result of this internal agita will be to raise the profile and most likely the profitability of Moores film which he still hopes will open on the July 4th weekend. So much for the controversy. How is it as a movie? Fahrenheit 9/11 -- the title is a play on the Ray Bradbury novel (and Francois Truffaut film) Fahrenheit 451 about a future totalitarian state where reading and thus independent thinking has been outlawed -- has news value beyond its financing and distribution tangles. The movie a brisk and entertaining indictment of the Bush Administrations middle East policies before and after September 11 2001 features new footage of abuse by U.S. soldiers a Christmas Eve 2003 sortie in which Iraqi captives are publicly humiliated. Though made over the past two years the film has scenes that seem ripped from recent headlines. Last week Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld visited Iraq and to the cheers of his military audience defiantly called himself ""a survivor"" (a word traditionally reserved for those who have lived through the Holocaust or cancer not for someone enduring political difficulties). In the film a soldier tells Moores field team ""If Donald Rumsfeld was here Id ask for his resignation."" Moores perennial grudge is against what President Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex the collusion of big corporations and bad government to exploit the working class here and abroad for their own gain and in the process deprive citizens of their liberties. The Bush Administrations Iraq policy is handmade for Moores grievances. Bush and his father have enjoyed a long and profitable relationship with the ruling families of Saudi Arabia including the bin Ladens. The best-seller ""House of Bush House of Saud"" by Craig Unger whom Moore interviews estimates that the Saudis have enriched the Bushes and their closest cronies by 1.4 billion. Politicians reward their biggest contributors and the Bushes are no exceptions. Fifteen of the 19 September 11th hijackers were Saudis; but when Prince Bandar the Saudi ambassador who is close to the First Family dined with the President in the White House two days after the attacks the mood was collegial not angry. In the Iraqi ramp-up and occupation the Administration has rewarded its Saudi and Texas supporters with billions in rebuilding contracts. As Blaine Ober president of an armored vehicle company tells Moore the Iraqi adventure is ""good for business bad for the people."" Bad for the people of Iraq Ober means. But Moore argues bad for Americans as well. As he sees it 9/11 was a tragedy for America a career move for Bush. The attacks allowed the President to push through Congress restrictive laws that would have been defeated in any climate but the ""war on terror"" chill. Fahrenheit 9/11 shows some tragicomic effects of the Patriot Act a man quizzed by the FBI for casually mentioning at his health club that he thought Bush was an ""asshole""; a benign peace group in Fresno Cal. infiltrated by an undercover police agent. Two Bush quotes in the film indicate the Administrations quandary in selling repression to the American people. One ""A dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier no doubt about it."" The other ""Theyre not happy theyre occupied. I wouldnt be happy if I were occupied either."" Moores argument is that the U.S. is currently being occupied by a hostile un-American force the quintet of Bush Rumsfeld Dick Cheney John Ashcroft and Paul Wolfowitz. Moore is usually the front-and-center star of his own films. Here his presence is mostly that of narrator and guiding force though he does make a few piquant appearances. While chatting with Unger across the street from the Saudi embassy in Washington he is approached and quizzed by Secret Service agents. Hearing from Rep. John Conyers that no member of Congress had read the complete Patriot Act before voting for it he hires a Mister Softee truck and patrols downtown D.C. reading the act to members of Congress over a loudspeaker. Toward the end he tries to get Congressmen to enlist their sons in the military. Surprise no volunteers. The film has its longueurs. The interviews with young blacks and a grieving mother in Moores home town of Flint Michigan are relevant and poignant but they lack the propulsive force and homespun indignance of the rest of the film. Fahrenheit 9/11 is at its best when it provides talking points for the emerging majority of those opposed to the Iraq incursion. In sum its an appalling enthralling primer of what Moore sees as the Bush Administrations crimes and misdemeanors. Fahrenheit 9/11 may be seen as another example of the liberal media preaching to its own choir. But Moore is such a clever assembler of huge accusations and minor peccadillos (as with a shot of Wolfowitz sticking his pocket comb in his mouth and sucking on it to slick down his hair before a TV interview) that the film should engage audiences of all political persuasions. In one sense Michael Moore took George W. Bushs advice. He found ""real work"" deconstructing the Presidents Iraq mistakes. Fahrenheit 9/11 is Moores own War on Error.

The sporadically effective docu trades far more in emotional appeals than in systematically building an evidence-filled case against the president and his circle. A correction was made to this review on May 20 2004. Its title notwithstanding Michael Moore has delivered a film rather less incendiary than might have been expected -- or wished for by his fans -- in ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" Designed as an indictment of the Bush administrations domestic and international policies since the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C. the sporadically effective docu trades far more in emotional appeals than in systematically building an evidence-filled case against the president and his circle. Thanks to Moores celebrity project has been a publicity magnet since its inception which assures plenty of continued media attention on the ramp up to its intended July U.S. release by an as-yet-to-be-determined distributor as well as hefty returns both theatrically and in DVD/homevid release in October a month before the election. Pic fails to provide any hard facts or make any incriminating connections that a reasonably informed person doesnt already know about so intellectually Moore is largely preaching to the converted in this blatant cinematic 2004 campaign pamphlet. Due to the way Moore has skewed his account to emphasize blacks other minorities and the poor as the primary domestic victims of Bushs policies it would seem that the groups the filmmaker primarily hopes to influence in November are the disenfranchised who dont normally turn out to vote in large numbers and ""patriotic"" Middle Americans who might be convinced not to automatically vote Republican. In these respects he might prove somewhat successful due to the emotionalism of his pitch. It may then be of secondary importance that much of the film is constructed of recycled parts drawn mostly from television and that it reveals Moore as an inadequate prosecuting attorney when it comes to collecting evidence rationally laying out his argument and delivering the coup de grace in a masterly summation. Instead his approach is scattershot and manipulative his tone derisive jokey and snide in regard to the administration and media but earnest when it comes to regular folk. If one agrees with Moores politics -- and indeed even if one doesnt but longs for the professional gadfly to give Bush his best shot -- there must be some disappointment that Moore hasnt made better use of his ample materials and various witnesses who appear to have the goods on the administration the Saudis and other matters. One has the feeling theres a lot more beneath the surface that will eventually come out but that Moore in his haste to get this film done before the election hasnt gotten it. Opening minutes once more stir the pot of the 2000 Florida election results controversy before pic sketches a portrait of George W. Bush as a do-nothing president who spent ""42% of his time"" during his first eight months in office ""on vacation"" (one wonders where that statistic came from and if it includes weekends). Exaggerated and repetitive footage of Bush holding a childrens book in a Florida elementary school class while the 9/11 attacks were happening are designed to make him look like a clueless dunce but pic then jumps into the serious business of the connections between the Bush and Bin Laden families and the covert and seemingly outrageous way in which at least two dozen members of the Bin Laden family were allowed to fly out of the United States when all other flights were still grounded. Theres a lot of meat here and ""House of Bush House of Saud"" author Craig Unger is briefly on camera to indicate as much. But Moores account consists mostly of innocuous archival footage of the first President Bush meeting and greeting Saudi dignitaries. These images may be pregnant with import but on the surface are no different from similar ones that could be found of any modern U.S. president or top official. Moore then comes up with a bit about a certain James R. Bath a fellow member of the Texas Air National Guard with George W. who subsequently became a business associate of the Bin Ladens. Other financial ties are mentioned as well and a Taliban leader is even shown being given a guided tour around Washington D.C. But for all the negative impressions one is supposed to take away from all this Moore completely fails to draw all this info together and propose what it means at the end of the day. Moore shows a photograph of one brother of Osama Bin Laden with the implication that there might be something sinister about him. But the film doesnt even spend one minute on backgrounding the Saud or Bin Laden families -- Osama has more than 50 siblings after all -- or in dealing with realpolitik issues that would begin to explain the history of U.S.-Saudi relations under a succession of administrations. A terrific entire film could have been devoted to detailing these ties -- indeed the Bush-Bin Laden link was mentioned as the subject of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" when it was first announced -- but Moores interest suddenly turns away from this in favor of a section ridiculing what he sees as the exaggeration of terrorist threats and hanging out with a lonely state trooper along an empty stretch of Oregon coastline to illustrate the vulnerability of U.S. borders despite the heightened alert. Still there is a very funny montage of administration honchos heads superimposed over the credits of ""Bonanza"" priceless footage of John Ashcroft publicly singing a ludicrous song of his own composition seemingly entitled ""Let the Eagle Soar"" and some glibly effective montages that catch officials in doubletalk and lies. Skipping quickly over Afghanistan -- Moore never lays out his opinions about the legitimacy of that war -- pic devotes its second half to Iraq. Loading up on the sort of gruesome images of the dead and wounded generally not shown on U.S. TV Moore takes his cheapest shot when he follows extended coverage of a distraught Iraqi woman wailing about her lost relatives with a clip of Britney Spears supporting the war. But against the backdrop of deteriorating conditions post-invasion the film settles into humanist mode focusing on the cost of the war in human terms rather than in the context of government miscalculations or rising rage in the Arab world. Moore returns to his native Flint Mich. to look at the armys recruiting efforts in areas of heavy minority and unemployed populations and juxtaposes this with blunt interviews with G.I.s who openly wonder what the hell theyre doing in Iraq express their distaste for the place or state their intention to oppose he war in the voting booth when the opportunity arrives. This above all is Moores message here. Most moving interlude features a very brave bereaved mother Lila Lipscomb surrounded by her family and keeping it mostly together as she talks about her dead soldier son and reads his last letter home. She then travels to Washington seeking some solace by physically confronting the White House a visit disturbed by a ranting protestor and a pro-war passerby and by Moores silly sidewalk efforts to get members of Congress to get their children to enlist in the military. Although he narrates Moore himself is less of a physical presence in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" than usual which actually increases his effectiveness onscreen at certain moments such as when hes questioned by an officer when hes filming outside the enormous Saudi Embassy across from the Watergate Hotel in D.C. Although there is an ominous shot or two of hooded prisoners chronology of the version shown in Cannes ends before the prisoner abuse scandal. Moore has indicated that he will update the film before U.S. release and that the DVD will include extra footage and a commentary.
