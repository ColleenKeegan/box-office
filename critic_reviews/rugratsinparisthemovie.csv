Comments Rugrats in Paris--The Movie Nickelodeons cartoon babies and their parents get a free trip to a Paris amusement park when one of the fathers who invented the main attraction is summoned to fix it. Nauseating gags--those that arent about dirty diapers concern the contents of an airsickness bag--suggest the makers of this eclectically animated adventure a follow-up to The Rugrats Movie (1998) know their audience though all the Godfather references will be thoroughly puzzling to at least half of it.

This review was corrected on Nov. 15 2000. Having joined the 100 million club with its debut feature the Rugrats gang has been rewarded with a trip to the City of Lights in the awkwardly titled ""Rugrats in Paris The Movie"" a sequel that proves to be superior on every level to the first effort. Though theres no disputing the huge financial success of the initial collaboration between animators Klasky/Csupo and Paramount ""The Rugrats Movie"" showed the creators considerable strain to stretch the continuous havoc made by their mostly diapered tube heroes to feature length. In ""Paris"" situation and complications are generated by real character desires and impulses rather than arch effects and arbitrary action thus getting the vast legion of tot fans and their attentive parents back to the shows roots. Though animated sequels of popular kids fare tend to perform lower than their progenitors this one should buck the trend with magnifique B.O. response long into the Christmas season. Attending to adults funny bone has always been a strength of the franchise and it shows in the opening title which morphs into a ""Godfather""-style graphic ""Rugrats II"" with the Pickles tykes play-acting from Paramounts Mafia epic. Rather than baby-in-charge Tommy (E.G. Daily) dominating the story proper its Tommys vulnerable buddy and this eras heir to the Charlie Brown throne Chuckie (Christine Cavanaugh) whose desire for a new mommy to replace his ""mommy in heaven"" overwhelms him during a wedding party and puts some pressure on dad Chas (Michael Bell) to date. As it did in previous pic father Stu Pickles (Jack Riley) invention of mechanical dino creature Reptar figures in the action but here in a more whimsical way that provides major digs at cross-town rival Disney. At the outlandishly conceived EuroReptarland -- a Japanese-styled theme park in Paris and a broad spoof at both EuroDisneyland and globalization -- the Reptar performing in the parks main animatronic spectacle has broken down enraging short-tempered and egomaniacal park manager Coco La Bouche (Susan Sarandon). Via surrogates Jean-Claude (John Lithgow) and Kira (Julia Kato) Coco orders Stu to Paris to fix Reptar with the unlikely invitation to the entire Pickles clan as well as Chas and Chuckie. Pic blows its grandest comic opportunity to use vast Paris backdrop and its myriad symbols as an animated ""Innocents Abroad"" There are no goofy tours through the Louvre no blubbering upsets at a Quartier Latin cafe. Family action is almost entirely contained within the theme park. The always-conniving older daughter Angelica Pickles (Cheryl Chase) caught by Coco in her office exploits a situation in which the single Coco is told by the parks retiring Japanese owner that she must marry in order to take his mantle. Angelica will thus become matchmaker for Coco and Chas. Complicating this are both Chuckies growing attachment to the mechanical character known as Princess which plays Beauty to Reptars Beast in the parks big show and Kiras affection for the boy and Chas. Of course Tommy and the other Rugrats are never too far behind causing their usual mischief which finally gives way in the climax to the inevitable Big Chase Scene -- the kids commanding the revitalized Reptar pursued by Jean-Claude in his giant mechanical Escargot. Despite the distractions Chuckies original hopes are realized and the overall story has a satisfying roundness to it missing in the previous Rugrats adventure which tended to forget about the overall family and place the babies in disturbingly extreme danger. Little aud members wont have such frights here and theyll have a new baddie -- albeit cut from the identical cloth of Cruella De Vil -- in the form of Coco to boo at. Thesp voicings are outstanding and sometimes reach the level of comic warmth of the ""Toy Story"" ensemble. Sarandon goes all out with a vicious French accent that fits the bold lines of how Coco is drawn. The regular ""Rugrats"" cast member who rises to the fore is Cavanaugh as Chuckie delivering the kind of psychologically pressured perf rare in kiddie animation. Projects Disney connection extends to several fine displays of illustrative animation in Mouse-like tradition including Chuckies fanciful dream of heroism. Fans of Brad Birds ""The Iron Giant"" will also note echoes here in the precise work realizing mechanical objects ranging from the airplane winging the Pickles to Paris to the romping stomping Reptar. The soundtrack is highlighted by a tune beautifully warbled by Sinead OConnor ""When You Love"" which in true ""Rugrats"" style will appeal to ears of all ages.

The whole Rugrats gang takes Paris in the new animated comedy ""Rugrats in Paris The Movie."" Rugrats Go Oui Oui 1 / 1 Back to Gallery RUGRATS IN PARIS THE MOVIE Animated comedy. With the voices of E.G. Daily Christine Cavanaugh Michael Bell Susan Sarandon Cheryl Chase Melanie Chartoff John Lithgow Debbie Reynolds. Directed by Stig Bergqvist cq and Paul Demeyer. (Rated G. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Rugrats make an amusing mess of the City of Light in ""Rugrats in Paris The Movie."" And the result is an arguably better movie than the original Rugrats film which made a killing at the box office. The Paris adventure of the diaper set and their funny kin features the voices of Susan Sarandon John Lithgow and Debbie Reynolds complementing those of TV regulars E.G. Daily Christine Cavanaugh Michael Bell and the ""Rugrats"" franchises Cheryl Chase as bratty Angelica. For those new to the Rugrats world this film may seem like a far-flung leap to nowhere -- more annoyance than entertainment. But with its solid characteri zation its a step up from the last film which used a lame lost-in-the-woods action-adventure gimmick and became a bit too dark and intense for the very young. The Rugrats at least as TV inhabitants dish up a surprisingly sophisticated examination of life as viewed from close-to-floor level. Theirs is a humorously glimpsed skew of human relationships often enunciated through endearingly mispronounced words. Characters more than plot drive the Nickelodeon show. In the film the Rugrats gang travels to Paris when absent-minded but kindly inventor dad Stu Pickles (Jack Riley) is summoned to the theme park Reptarland. The Japanese-owned park is based on his dinosaur creation Reptar. The big dino lug is having mechanical problems and Stu is needed for doctoring. At the same time Rugrat Chuckie Finsters widower dad Chas (Bell) is thinking about dating again giving the lovable Chuckie (Cavanaugh) hope that hell soon be getting a new mom. The other familiar Rugrats characters are here too Chuckies best friend Tommy Pickles (Daily) toddler twins Phil and Lil DeVille (Soucie) and baby Dil (Tara Charendoff). When the gang gets to Reptarland it encounters theme-park manager CoCo LaBouche (Sarandon) a stereotype of the ruthless scheming French femme. Shes served by loyal sideburned sidekick Jean-Claude (Lithgow) who adds to the fun. Her assistant is a sweet intern named Kira (Julia Kato). CoCo learns that she may be given total control of the theme park but the retiring owner stipulates that she must be a married person to be considered for the job. The conniving Angelica turns matchmaker between the ruthless CoCo and the naive Chas. Theres no particular reason the story is set in Paris. Most of the action takes place inside the American-style theme park and the Parisian backdrops are just occasional postcard settings. Considering what the Rugrats might have discovered in a more fully realized cosmopolitan Paris one is struck by the missed opportunity for education and enlightenment. For teens and adults the action is laced with amusing references to other movies (the best are re-enactments of scenes from ""The Godfather"") and to a satire of global commercialization and jabs at Euro Disney. But most tots in the audience wont give a pickle.

Weiss; Producer (group) Klasky-Csupo Nickelodeon Pictures; Release Date Wide 11/17/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 78; MPAA Rating G; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted November 24 2000 -- 1200 AM EST With its melange of poo-poo humor and pop-culture in-jokes Nickelodeons Rugrats packs appeal for both kids and parents. Adult-friendly content was largely lost in the peewees first big-screen adventure 1998s too-frenetic The Rugrats Movie but its been restored for the tres superior sequel Rugrats in Paris -- The Movie. This becomes clear from the first scene a dead-on parody of The Godfather in which the titular toddlers seek favors from the all-powerful 4-year-old Angelica (twins Phil and Lil are spooked by a hobbyhorses head in their crib). Soon the rats scurry off to France where precociously neurotic Chuckie Finster must stop his widowed dad from marrying the child-loathing Coco La Bouche (fervently voiced by Susan Sarandon). Unlike say Digimon The Movie the lavishly animated Rugrats in Paris doesnt merely look like a blown-up washed-out TV episode. The newfound emotional depth of the movies drawings -- and its plotline -- is most movingly illustrated when an airborne Chuckie sees images of himself with his late mother in the clouds. Lest this sounds too high-minded for little ones fear not Poop booger and barf gags abound. Given the setting you cant blame the filmmakers for making comic use of the bidet (""A potty that squirts back"" exults Phil) not to mention the timeless taunt that begins ""I see London I see France...""
