Returning to his estranged fathers crumbling pile in 1891 - to investigate his brothers disappearance - actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) falls for his dead siblings mourning fiancee Gwen (Emily Blunt). But before this spark of love can ignite Lawrence is bitten by the lunar-tic creature the locals fear and must confront the beast buried within himself. With its mist-shrouded sets gruesome slaughter and copious CGI this is a surprisingly respectful updating of the 1941 Universal original. Thanks to Rick Bakers make-up effects Del Toros transformations from handsome lover to hairy howling beast are frighteningly convincing; Anthony Hopkins is restrained as his emotionally detached father; and a cruelly underused Blunt is all-a-quiver as the beautiful bereaved Gwen. Ultimately though neither Joe Johnstons efficient direction nor Danny Elfmans hard-working score can lift the familiar storyline out of the ordinary.

To cut through the shameless syrup of their source material adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels require that real heat be generated between love-torn leads. Tatum and Seyfried exhibit the same chemistry Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams shared in 2004s The Notebook -- the most profitable page-to-screen transition in the Sparks oeuvre -- and Dear Johnclosely follows that films template the South Carolina setting the romance between a prole guy and rich gal separation by war putting pen to paper mental impairments (autism in Dear John Alzheimers inThe Notebook) casting one of the stars of Mean Girlsas the female lead. Director Lasse Hallstrom who cut his teeth crafting mini-melodramas in Abba videos deals with the inevitable emotional contrivances (mild 9/11-sploitation diseases ex machina) matter of factly. The biggest surprise here is Tatum whose butch reticence has never been put to better use His saddest farewell isnt to his lady but to a man even more uncommunicative than he is. (Melissa Anderson) (Citywide) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - GO  AJAMI A contemporary crime drama edged with Greek tragedy Ajami is an untidy despairing oddly exhilarating joint venture by writer-directors Scandar Copti an Israeli Arab and Yaron Shani an Israeli Jew. Set on the tinderbox margins of a rundown quarter of the Tel Aviv-adjacent city of Jaffa the movies multiple plots and unwieldy mostly nonpro ensemble of Arabs and Jews might better lend themselves to a television series. Yet it teems with life energized by fierce formal ambitions. Barely held together by chapter headings the action -- which opens in the middle of its converging storylines with a mistaken drive-by shooting -- switches dizzyingly between time place and point of view and the fact that you cant tell one kind of Semite from another works its own sadly ironic magic. The bleak future Ajami projects for peace within and across Israels borders can be hard to bear but this sympathetically humanist movie takes its place among a new generation of Middle Eastern films which measures the terrible toll of war not only in dead bodies but also in the very fabric of everyday life for Arabs as well as Jews. (Ella Taylor) (Monica 4-Plex Music Hall Town Center)GO  THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN AMERICA DANIEL ELLSBERG AND THE PENTAGON PAPERS Daniel Ellsberg was an ex-Marine trusted analyst and Cold Warrior under Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara who ""from the entrails of a bureaucratic war machine"" -- per a latter-day peacenik cohort -- converted to antiwar dove. Leaking 7000 Xeroxed pages of the Pentagon Papers study to newspapers Ellsberg gave the world an alternate history of five administrations policies in Southeast Asia and spurred a breached White House into paranoiac espionage ending in presidential resignation. Ellsberg has been resurrected as an ""eternal left"" hero in recent times publishing a memoir in 2002 and being played by James Spader in a 2003 TV movie. Filmmakers Judith Ehrlich and Rick Goldsmith approach their subject as though burnishing an icon -- he withstands the homage well. In old age Ellsberg is still an articulate interviewee; seen in his years of infamy he resembles a wiry amalgam of the Cassavetes regulars. The impressive roll call of assembled talking heads includes ""Plumber"" Egil ""Bud"" Krogh who authorized the burgling of Ellsbergs psychiatrists office; and Anthony Russo Ellsbergs recently deceased accomplice and RAND Co. co-worker. Most Dangerous Man makes a few distracting embellishments -- reenactments (some shabbily animated) melodramatic cloak-and-dagger scoring -- but in the main its a professional job standing above the crowd of politico documentaries that proliferate like kudzu over art-house screens. (Nick Pinkerton) (Music Hall)MY NAME IS KHAN was not screened in advance of our publication deadline but a review will appear here next week.

The fearsome north face of the Eiger mountain became the object of national socialist obsession during the 30s. An Olympic gold medal was promised to its first summit party -- preferably to be of good blond Aryan stock and the Nazi press glorified those alpinists who tried. Though as a newspaper editor says in this dramatization of an epic real-life attempt ""those two dont care about the politics"" referring to the rustic Bavarian mountaineers who quit the Wehrmacht to make the attempt -- after bicycling 700 kilometers to Switzerland with their gear Benno Furmann and Florian Lukas play the impetuous pair. Embellishing the story is a journalist from their home village Luise (Johanna Wokalek) who provides a love interest and tears. Climbers who know the famous tale neednt be warned of spoilers Shot on location the film is slow realistic and excruciating in its latter stages. The difference between a 50- and 60-meter rope is life and death; a lost mitten means debilitating frostbite. There are no helmets GPS units or cell phones to use to call for rescue. This isnt a companion to climbing drama Vertical Limit but rather to the documentary Touching the Void. (The train-tunnel ""gallery"" windows drilled through the Nordwand are also familiar from Clint Eastwoods The Eiger Sanction.) Director Philipp Stolzl makes the movie a tad more political (i.e. anti-Nazi) than it needs to be but Furmanns stoic performance reduces the story to its harsh true fundamentals. Of the risks in climbing (as in life) he says ""You can be the best but its still a lottery.""(Brian Miller) (Citywide) ORDER OF CHAOS If you thought tax attorneys were all wonky pencil-pushers writer-director Vince Vielufs overheated psychological thriller aims to disabuse you of that notion. Mild-mannered straight-arrow John (Rhys Coiro) is towing the company line and about to land a big account when he meets his new co-worker Rick (Milo Ventimiglia) an ultraconfident bad boy who decides John needs to loosen up and stop letting people boss him around. Before you can say bad influence Rick has John partying all hours of the night fraternizing with loose women and mouthing off to his icy fiancee (Samantha Mathis). But of course Ricks motives are far from altruistic. For a little while Order of Chaos is merely dim-witted malarkey as Vieluf strains to orchestrate an edgy Bret Easton Ellis-style decadence -- editor Jennifer Mayer seems to have been paid by the flash cut -- but soon it becomes painfully clear that the filmmaker actually envisions this mano-a-mano revenge tale as some sort of tortured commentary on the corruption of the American Dream. As suave devilish Rick Ventimiglia seems to be channeling late-80s Tom Cruise while Coiro succeeds in being unconvincing as both a timid wimp and later a paranoid hedonist. All in all Order of Chaos is about as scintillating as an audit -- with slightly more nudity. (Tim Grierson) (Sunset 5)PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS THE LIGHTING THIEF was not screened in advance of our publication deadline but a review will appear here next week.RED RIDING TRILOGY Now a 305-minute triptych film Red Riding originated in the novels of David Peace who looked back without nostalgia to the Yorkshire of his youth. Peaces four Red Riding books set between 1974 and 1983 tell four compact overlapping narratives of crime and punishment -- rarely of the guilty. Adapted by screenwriter Tony Grisoni Red Riding Trilogys three episodes are each handled by a different noteworthy U.K. director. Julian Jarrolds 1974 concerns Eddie Dunford (Andrew Garfield) who has moved home from the south for Dads funeral and a job as a junior crime reporter. He starts to cover the disappearances of local girls and decries something rotten in Yorkshire as his investigations dont jive with the conviction of a local half-wit. 1980 the best freestanding film by a wide margin takes place during the last at-large days of the Yorkshire Ripper who held North England in suspense for five years and 13 murders. Peter Hunter (Paddy Considine) is a Manchester internal affairs man sent across the moors to review the failed search for The Ripper and Hunters outsider status allows director James Marsh several face-offs between conceited contained Considine and the resentful Yorkies. But any spell cast is diffused by weak cleanup man Anand Tuckers whiffed 1983 returning to 1974s crime(s) in smeary digital video. Another missing child triggers flashbacks and David Morrisseys career copper remembers his conscience while picking up Dunford and Hunters loose threads. A bathetic conclusion previews what we can anticipate from Ridley Scotts announced American remake. (Nick Pinkerton)(Nuart)TERRIBLY HAPPY After waving a gun around at home young Copenhagen cop Robert Hansen (Jakob Cedergren) is shipped to the South Jutland flatlands to cool off as marshal of a small town. Surprising no one who has watched such a migration onscreen before he finds amused villagers with a highly developed talent for collusion and a tendency to become familiar with their new impartial authority. Within minutes a married woman Ingerlise with a concussed Rita Rudner affect sidles into his office and delivers a spiel thats part blowzy flirtation and part ambiguous report of spousal abuse. The paunchy cowboy-hatted wife beater Jorgen has the run of the place dark deeds unfold on the marshy outskirts and everyones okay with it. Hansen peers out cautiously from his innocent stubble-dusted face as if afraid of being found out as director Henrik Ruben Genzs simmering stew sees a man who made one violent mistake be ruined anew by genially corrupt yokels. Cedergren is a little too bland but that works with Hansens air of haplessness and sets him apart from the colorful locals. Hansens self-inflicted reckoning is a horizon visible throughout the movie and the bog outside of town is a thudding but effective metaphor for willful repression. That quagmire where incriminating items (like cars and bodies) may be secretly dumped poses the double-edged-sword solution to Hansens despair over the past Just forget about it. (Nicolas Rapold) (Sunset 5 Playhouse 7) WAITING FOR ARMAGEDDON ""When I look at whats happening in the Middle East"" says an interviewee in Waiting for Armageddon ""I dont look at it with the hope that things will work out."" Moments later rhapsodizing about floating in post-Rapture clouds alongside Christ while earthbound sinners writhe in torment he chuckles ""Itll be a lot of fun to watch."" Co-directed by Kate Davis Franco Sacchi and David Heilbroner Armageddon is Doc Filmmaking 101 -- establishing shot talking head repeat. What makes it compelling is the juxtaposition of the filmmakers professional detachment with the chilling words and smug attitudes of their right-wing Evangelical Christian subjects who hang themselves with their own religious/ideological rope. (Christs love compassion and mercy go unmentioned here by his followers.) Armageddon efficiently glides from churches both small and mega to the homes of its subjects over to Israel with a tour group of true (and gallingly bigoted) believers as it unravels the Evangelical crowds perverse reasons for supporting Israel. It traces the political roots of the movement to a Democrat outlines said movements power bases (school boards corporations political offices) and their numbers (an estimated 50 million) and lets level-headed theologians refute bloodlust interpretations of scripture. But those refutations are little comfort against the manifest power of American entitlement and religious superiority fueling final-days fantasies against which the film winds up being a sobering warning. (Ernest Hardy) (Downtown Independent)THE WOLFMAN The Wolfman has it all -- mist drifting over moonlit moors; Geraldine Chaplin as a Gypsy fortune-teller; a dark gloomy castle full of cobwebs and family secrets; effective fake-out scares complete with crisply jarring sound; a bombastic score and a soundtrack overstuffed with creepy whispers. Benicio Del Toro stars in this lushly art-designed 19th-century period film but his beefcake-gone-bad magnetism is not enough to justify sitting through a movie thats full of sound fury and unintentional camp -- and is still bafflingly inert. After acclaimed actor Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) receives a letter from his brothers fiancee (Emily Blunt) informing him of his siblings disappearance he hightails it from the New York stage to the sprawling home of his estranged family only to be greeted by the news that his brothers badly mutilated body has been recovered. A bonehead move that the script passes off as heroism (lots of those) soon results in Talbot being bitten by the creature who killed his brother. Blood gore and a laughably bad insane-asylum sequence ensue. Some father-son conflict (papa Talbot is played by Anthony Hopkins alternately hammy and sleepwalking through the part) juices the film a bit but not enough to save it.

Lawrence Talbot (Benicio del Toro) is destined to howl at the moon. Photo Universal Pictures The Wolfman 1 / 1 Back to Gallery If we learn one lesson from The Wolfman Universals feverish new redo of its own horror classic its this the transmogrification of human to furrball is never ever pretty. Knuckles warp. Feet burst out of shoes. Cheekbones and forehead bend and expand making room for pot-scrubber bristles of hair. As a wise old Gypsy says struck by the existential pickle twining man and beast ""Where does one begin and the other end?"" Indeed. The Wolfman never answers that thorny question but its filmmakers -- Jumanji director Joe Johnston and screenwriters Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self -- do their part exploring the hell that is the human psyche. They also get a kick out of graphic dismemberments impalements decapitations gutted faces gored chest cavities and large glistening coils of spilled viscera. Lots and lots of spilled viscera. The plight of Lawrence Talbot the bedeviled young lord of late-19th-century Blackmoor (a fittingly tortured Benicio del Toro) hasnt changed much since Lon Chaney donned the fangs in 1941s The Wolf Man but the wholesale butchery of the tale has definitely kicked up a notch or two. No surprise there Horror in the age of pixels generally veers toward overkill. More unusual is the films vintage spirit and overheated style captured best by Danny Elfmans super-romantic music and the Wolfmans mournful howling glissando. The movie even sounds old. Sheer gothic kitsch is the order of the day. Theres no point in making or watching an oldfangled romantic horror film if you dont have the stomach for trembling hearts (del Toros and Emily Blunts) inquiring detectives (Hugo Weavings) or quivering Freudian subtexts that would bring out the monster in any carnally inclined English nobleman. (The movies one prominent shrink doesnt fare too well. Funny that.) Shelly Johnsons ashen cinematography gives every scene the look of midnight. Clouds rush past the full moon. Already-pale Victorians blanch with fear loading their guns with silver bullets for the four-legged wolf-thing bounding the moors. Actors fulminate and masticate spit scowl and sob; what a gas it is to watch them overact with joy and conviction. Understatement be damned theyre in a gen-u-ine hairy-scary werewolf movie not some Nair-chested Twilight boytown and they are clearly loving every minute of it. As for The Wolfmans many computerized stunts most are half-baked and unconvincing. Perhaps theyre intentionally bad -- yet another nod to films of yore -- but in this context they barely matter. The stylish gloom and warped psychological drama give the tale its juice. Anyway the movies best special effect hands-down is Anthony Hopkins as Talbot the Elder who flounces around in a tiger stole and utters his lines with such a delicious madman twinkle you might want to snack on him yourself (ahhh-ROOooh). Whether all of this qualifies as loving homage or grade-B camp -- well lets call it both. Like the line between man and beast its sometimes hard to spot the difference.

Film Friday Youve seen all the cliches before Add to ... James Adams The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 12 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Wolfman Starring Benicio Del Toro Anthony Hopkins Emily Blunt Directed by Joe Johnston Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self Classification 18A In the 21st century can you get away with the line ""If anything ever happened to you Id never forgive myself""? Or ""I cannot stress enough the mortal peril you are in""? Or ""The darkest hours of hell lie before you""? No you cant - especially if all of these sentences (and many more like them) are uttered in the same film. In this case the movie is The Wolfman an ill-considered utterly unnecessary remake of the 1941 pulp classic The Wolf Man starring Lon Chaney Jr. Perhaps these hoary - or should that be hairy? - lines could have been redeemed with some biting wit or a flash of panache or campy self-awareness. But theres no such redemption here The Wolfmans lycanthropic hokum is delivered straight up as if it really were 1891 (the year in which the film is set) and were seeing and hearing its conceits pretty much for the first time not the 40th or the 400th. Yes familiarity can be a comforting thing - I take my daily shower at pretty much the same time every morning and like it - but in art its a recipe for at best boredom and at worst contempt. Sadly there are no real surprises in The Wolfman no tweaks to freshen the idiom a la An American Werewolf in London or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Indeed the films central ""mystery"" is resolved at about the 50-minute mark (a mystery that even the most nonchalant viewer has figured out early on) forcing the enterprise to become one long bloody denouement orchestrated to the relentless pound-and-throb of Danny Elfmans orchestral score. Yet for all the bloodletting its one anemic Wolfman. Plot-wise the movie has Benicio Del Toro playing Lawrence Talbot a distinguished Shakespearean actor who having been banished by his father (Anthony Hopkins) years earlier to the United States after his mothers apparent suicide returns to stately spooky Talbot Manor in England upon hearing his brother has disappeared. While at the ancestral home he meets Gwen (Emily Blunt) his brothers fiancee. We soon learn that the brother has been killed horribly so - the latest victim it seems of some sort of howling monster loose on the misty moonlit heath possessed of superhuman strength and an insatiable bloodlust. The ""natives"" of course are restless scared and eager for revenge. Travelling late one night to a nearby Roma encampment to learn more about these goings-on Lawrence ends up being bitten by the beast. Soon he discovers the truth of the Roma adage about how even a man ""who is pure of heart ... may become a wolf when the wolfsbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright."" Both Del Toro and Hopkins are Oscar winners but anyone expecting sparks in their encounters here will be disappointed. The Puerto Rican-born Del Toro delivers his lines mostly sotto voce without affect as if afraid that anything more passionate and less brooding might reveal a Spanish accent and blow the notion that hes of aristocratic British descent. Hopkins similarly works the quiet side of his repertoire the very picture of nonchalant evil. Naturally at movies end theres a Mothra-versus-Godzilla confrontation between the two but while mercifully short its too frantic and uninvolving. Of the major players only Blunt delivers a performance approximating real feeling. The Wolfman is a handsome enough as far as its production values go - all cob-webbed banisters dark bric-a-brac-filled interiors milky light and brooding skies. Joe Johnston ( Jurassic Park III) brought in to replace Mark Romanek ( One Hour Photo) as director less than a month before the start of principal photography is nothing if not craftsman-like. But his fondness for moon shots is wearying and too often his close-ups telegraph the mayhem thats just seconds away. His Wolfman isnt howlingly awful; its just not terribly scary or even suspenseful. The deja voodoo The Wolfman trucks in has just been around too long.

(Universal Pictures) B The Wolf Man Genre Horror; Starring Evelyn Ankers Lon Chaney Ralph Bellamy Patric Knowles Bela Lugosi; Director George Waggner Posted February 12 2010 -- 1200 AM EST Remember ground fog? That smoky thick dry ice stuff that used to swirl through black-and-white Hollywood forests and graveyards? The Wolfman a remake of the cheesy-spooky 1941 Universal horror classic has enough ground fog to make you feel like youre trapped in? well a rather ancient horror movie. For a good stretch I thought ground fog was about all the film was going to offer -- that and a lot of very solemn borderline deadly scenes in which Lawrence Talbot the prodigal heir played by Benicio Del Toro returns to the castle of his father Sir John embodied by Anthony Hopkins in that blustery style Hopkins always uses when it looks as if hes trying to wake the scenery. Directed by Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park III) The Wolfman starts off in a fairly stilted manner. It looks a bit too much like a borrowed backlot gothic funhouse and Emily Blunt as the love interest (the former fiancee of Del Toros brother) stands around and pouts without having enough to do. Then something curious happens. After Del Toros Lawrence gets bitten by a werewolf and turns into one himself hes accused of insanity and packed off to a Victorian mental institution. There hes subjected to such unfair treatment that we start rooting for him to sprout hair and fangs and show his captors a bit of the beast within. Nothing makes a Wolfman movie work quite like getting you on the Wolfmans side. Del Toro who looks a bit sunk in torpor during the first part of the movie comes alive once he gets a taste of blood. The transformation scenes generally the best part of any werewolf film were dreamed up by the venerable make-up magician Rick Baker and they feature lots of twisting straining fingers and limbs and dripping lupine incisors. Nothing in other words that we havent seen before. (Baker did this sort of thing just as well almost 30 years ago in An American Werewolf in London.) Theyre still fun though and Del Toro with his melancholy-brute features endows this raging beast with some of the ""Why me?"" poignance you may remember from Lon Chaney Jr.s performance in the original. Lawrence you see has no desire to be a werewolf. He doesnt get off on the power of the dark side; he just wants to be free of it. And that lends The Wolfman hokey and uneven though it is the kind of authentic emotional hook that too many horror movies today dont have.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""The Wolfman"" Universals reboot of its 1941 genre classic one brother meets his end at the razor-sharp claws of an unknown fiend. Another returns to his fathers estate in the dashed hopes of finding his sibling alive. Instead he finds the promise of love and the burden of a curse. Anthony Hopkins portrays Sir John Talbot. Benicio Del Toro is prodigal son Lawrence. Thats a great deal of acting sinew for an oddly anemic outing. The year is 1891. The townspeople and their minister are jittery. Theyre also all too happy to suspect gypsies for their troubles. Prophetic chieftess Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin) knows otherwise and says so in the glow of amber flame in this heavily atmospheric tale. Indeed the body count -- and sheer brutality -- suggest something more ornery than the gypsy caravans dancing bear. A fleet lethal predator roams moor and woods. When Lawrence is attacked by the creature he becomes as vulnerable to the full moon as the first cruel still at- large beast. Now understandably dour Scotland Yard inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving) has two predators to hunt. It takes Hopkins little screen time to establish oppressive weight as the Talbot patriarch. Though Sir John is as unkempt as his mansion is dingy he has daunting authority. ""The Wolfman"" is a low-light affair nearly as misty and murky as Blackmoor where the carnage takes place. It can make for a certain drowsiness. Please sir could we have another lantern? A beacon comes in the form of Emily Blunt so recently impressive in ""The Young Victoria."" As Gwen Conliffe fiancee to the dead Talbot brother her face registers regret sorrow pity for the man who would have been her brother-in-law. If the tormented Lawrence cant quite mourn for himself she does. In the 1941 original Lon Chaney Jr. brimmed with pathos as the tortured soul turned lycanthrope. Del Toro digs into Lawrences suffering but remains strangely muted. Lawrence has witnessed terror and later betrayal. He survived his ordeal. He became an actor. He traveled abroad. A freighted flashback shows him onstage playing the Dane Hamlet. Its hardly a subtle hint of the masculine melancholy to come. The notion of the curse of the father hangs heavy. To his credit director Joe Johnston isnt enslaved by special effects. Classy as Rick Bakers makeup effects are the remakes raison detre isnt in showing off the transformation of man to monster. ""The Wolfman"" does however carry an R rating which points to a misunderstanding of where the heart of the story lies. Its not in the strewn entrails and dismemberments the beast is capable of. No its in Lawrences yearning to be other than outcast his fear of a rage he didnt court his thwarted hope for love. These are themes younger audience can handle and vibrate along with. For those of us who as kids devoured TV broadcasts of the old Universal monster flicks this is a loss. ""The Wolfman"" R for bloody horror violence and gore. 1 hour 43 minutes. Directed by Joe Johnston; written by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self; based on Curt Siodmaks motion picture screenplay; photography by Shelly Johnson; starring Anthony Hopkins Benicio Del Toro Emily Blunt Hugo Weaving.

So theres a certain old-fashioned pleasure wrapped up in The Wolfman a no-frills remake of the 1941 semi-classic hatched by the same Universal horror factory that brought us the original Frankenstein and Dracula. Stately and a little stiff this Wolfman takes us back to the dark 19th-century moors where Lon Chaney Jr. created his lycanthropic mayhem. This time the unfortunate howler is played by Benicio Del Toro not exactly a natural fit for the Victorian milieu but still capable of conjuring the proper tragic notes. Del Toros Lawrence Talbot has grown distant from his dad (Anthony Hopkins) but he still returns to the old family estate when his brother Ben is killed in grisly fashion. Bens widow played by Emily Blunt wants Lawrence to investigate and whos going to turn down Emily Blunt?Much of the rest you know. Lawrence goes poking around the local Gypsy community gets chomped and develops a habit of howling at the full moon. He never gets around to drinking a pina colada at Trader Vics and his hair isnt perfect but he does make it to London when a bloody rampage lands him in an asylum. This is where The Wolfman attains a Dickensian darkness that it wears quite well especially in a scene that finds our furry friend laying waste to a room of pompous academics. You may have published but youre still about to perish.Much has been made of this movies constantly changing opening date going back to November 2008. But if this isnt a masterpiece its hardly a disaster. Fort Worth native Joe Johnston directs with a respect for creaky old houses false shocks ancient curses and other staples of vintage monster movies. Some of the supporting players particularly Hugo Weaving as the requisite inspector from Scotland Yard tear into the task with gusto. Rick Baker who wowed us with the special-effects makeup of An American Werewolf in London does similarly fine work here.I could do without the extended lobo y lobo action sequence at the end; these showdowns have become so cliched that not even a different species can make them fresh. But most of what comes first achieves a vivid combination of gloom pathos and excitement even if it never goes too far beneath the surface. Consider The Wolfman a pedigreed genre yarn mindful of its precedents but nimble enough to have a good time in the here and now.Director Joe Johnston.

"" Starring Benicio Del Toro Anthony Hopkins Emily Blunt Hugo Weaving Art Malik Director Joe Johnston Running time 205 Release Opened Feb 12 2010  Editorial Review Del Toros at the back of the packBy Rick WarnerFriday Feb. 12 2010The arms and legs begin to stretch. The hands turn into razor-sharp claws. The teeth grow jagged the head and body sprout coarse hair and the eyes gleam with a ferocious killers stare. Benicio Del Toros creepy transformation from man to beast is the highlight of ""The Wolfman"" an otherwise uninspired remake of the 1941 horror classic starring Lon Chaney Jr. as the poor sucker who becomes a werewolf after being bitten by one.Chaney was typecast as a monster after that. Del Toro who won an Oscar for ""Traffic"" better hope that viewers forget his cheesy performance here as soon as possible. Director Joe Johnston whose eclectic rsum includes ""October Sky"" and ""Jurassic Park III"" pulls out all the stops to make us scream and bite our tongues. Quick cuts build tension. Thumping ominous music warns us when something terrifying is about to happen. Special effects make the werewolfs bloody attacks look even more savage. (If severed heads and chopped-off arms disturb you dont even think about buying a ticket.)Yet its all too predictable and by the book. Even with a few plot twists that arent in the original I was hardly shocked or awed. While its sleeker and more sophisticated than the Chaney version this new ""Wolfman"" isnt any scarier.Unlike the original which was set in 20th-century Wales the remake takes place in Victorian England where celebrated actor Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) returns home after a long absence to help find his missing brother. Soon after arriving he learns that his brother is the latest victim of a vicious creature -- or possibly deranged human -- that has been killing and mutilating local residents.As a Scotland Yard inspector (Hugo Weaving) searches for the culprit Talbot tries to reconnect with his aloof father Sir John (a white-bearded Anthony Hopkins) who sent the boy to America after he was traumatized by his mothers death. Sir John it turns out is hiding a ghastly secret that will lead to the ultimate family feud.Lawrence is on friendlier terms with his late brothers fiancee (the fetching Emily Blunt) who demonstrates amazing understanding when he starts to walk on the wild side. Most men can only fantasize about a woman who isnt disgusted by crooked teeth carpeted chests and unclipped nails. Some of the villagers blame the attacks on Gypsies who struck me as rather harmless excluding their annoying habit of making cryptic predictions by candlelight.By the way the Wolfmans piercing howl doesnt come from a wolf. The filmmakers got the sound they were looking for from an opera singer they discovered at a Los Angeles audition. What they couldnt find old tapes of Wolfman Jack?Warner is the movie critic for Bloomberg News.Contains bloody horror violence.

Photo (c)Universal Benicio Del Toro as a hairy psycho who roams the land on a deranged murder spree while driven by a monstrous disease? I thought this movie was called ""Che."" No its ""The Wolfman"" though Del Toro again crosses the sea to rescue an island nations peasants (who wind up wishing hed never gotten on a boat). B. Del T. is actor Lawrence Talbot a Shakespearean thespian working the New York stages called home to England by a letter from his brothers girlfriend (Emily Blunt) informing him that his brothers gone missing. Once Lawrence arrives though his frosty dad (Anthony Hopkins) informs him that he neednt have bothered -- the cherished siblings been torn apart by a savage man-beast. Lawrence resolves to stay until the killer is found but wandering the forest at night in the presence of a bloodthirsty murder machine turns out not to be as smart as youd think. VIDEO ""THE WOLFMAN"" MOVIE REVIEW As a story ""The Wolfman"" is a strange beast. Think of another popcorn movie in which youd have a relatively happy ending if only the hero killed himself in Act 2. Yet the movie is pungent with atmosphere laying down a thick fog of creepy Victorian murk with tight action scenes and without the cheesy one-liners and would-be hipness of ""Sherlock Holmes"" which takes place at the same time 1891. Still the story can never quite sink its claws into you. Our shaggy protagonist -- this Chia Pet ""Incredible Hulk"" -- is neither hero nor villain. Make him full-on evil like Dracula or the Mummy and youve got a cool monster movie. Make him a richly tortured soul searching for a cure or at least some self-control like the Hulk or Frankensteins creature and youve got tragic potential. This movie cant even give wolfie a genuine love story. Blunt asks him ""Whats it like in New York?"" and its like every other awkward first date. The supposed villains -- such as a Scotland Yard detective (Hugo Weaving -- him again?) are merely trying to save innocent lives a fact even Dogbreath implicitly acknowledges. Yet the best scenes are nastily effective. Perhaps the best is one set in a morally polluted ""Elephant Man""-styled London where Lawrence a prisoner at a mental hospital comes in for some harsh reprogramming by a Dr. Strangelove-like shrink. But even in this case high-grade visuals conceal a story flaw Why would the doc think werewolfiness is all in Lawrences mind when an entire village has witnessed the wolfman getting down to business? Like buffalo meat ""The Wolfman"" is a little too lean for its own good. Who is Lawrence really? What is the measure of his anguish? A movie longer than 90 minutes might have had time to explain. We dont even get a backstory about the silver bullets. All the villagers are simply aware that this is the only way to kill a werewolf as if they all looked it up on Wikipedia. The story would be more exciting if it were a matter of the wolfman outsmarting himself arranging to be chained up at every full moon and trying to stay ahead of the police long enough to find a cure -- but as the Gypsies who lurk in the forest spewing ancient wisdom tell us lycanthropy is a one-way street. Oh theres one little mystery to be solved but its so simple that even Marmaduke could have sniffed it out -- plus theres no reason for Lawrence not to have known the truth all along. So Lawrence is left with one not-all-that-challenging task to follow through on. But if youre not in a thinky mood director Joe Johnston stages the climax more than adequately with much snarling beastiness. When in doubt set fire to the set? Works for me. As a spooky midnight movie ""The Wolfman"" is worth curling up with. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next London couples Happy medium Read Next London couples Happy medium Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46195 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20783 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17005 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Wolfman The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wolfman-the ) Wolfman The (United States 2010) February 11 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli All of the great Universal horror movies from the 1930s and 1940s have now been remade Dracula Frankenstein The Mummy and The Wolf Man. Over the years there have been numerous cinematic encounters with lycanthropy but The Wolf Man is to werewolves what Dracula is to vampires. He is unique. Since Lon Chaney Jr. cast aside the mantle of Lawrence Talbot following his run-in with Abbott and Costello in 1948 no one has picked it up... until now. In accepting the part Benicio Del Toro isnt playing a werewolf; he is playing the werewolf. For most long-time horror fans Chaneys portrayal of the tortured Talbot and his vicious alter-ego is as iconic as can be found in the annals of the ""monster movie."" Del Toros lack of success therefore may be unwelcome but it is not entirely unexpected. Its hard to work in the long shadow cast by the likes of Karloff Lugosi or Chaney but unavoidable when re-making one of their movies. The root problem with The Wolfman is that its a hybrid. It tries to fuse the gothic storytelling of the original with the violence and gore associated with modern horror. Its wedding of traditional makeup with CGI is uneasy. Director Joe Johnston wants this movie to be the bridge between the restrained atmosphere-soaked Universal horror classic and the grotesque likes of An American Werewolf in London and The Howling. It doesnt work. Parts of The Wolfman - even those that were effective in the original - have been recreated in a fashion that seems more Monty Python than unsettling. More disappointing is the makeup provided by veteran Rick Baker (the go-to man for this sort of work) which looks inexcusably campy. The fangs look like they were purchased at a Halloween costume store and during the big werewolf-on-werewolf clash I was reminded of Bigfoot from The Six Million Dollar Man. One has to wonder whether Bakers decision to remain true to the general appearance of the original Wolf Man is the right one. Nostalgia isnt always the best barometer by which to make creative decisions. The action which elects to retain a period piece flavor rather than time-shift the story takes place in the 1890s on the moors of rural England. There stands the estate of Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) whose son Ben has disappeared. The other Talbot heir Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) now a touring stage actor answers a plea from his brothers fiancA(c) Gwen Conliffe (Emily Blunt) to come home and search for the missing man. By the time Lawrence reaches Talbot Hall a mangled body has been found and a funeral has been arranged. Lawrence determined to find the beast responsible for his brothers death begins a hunt that leads him to a gypsy camp. While there he is attacked by a half-man/half-wolf. The gypsy woman Maleva (Geraldine Chaplin) sutures the wound but pronounces Lawrence to be cursed ""Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright."" Indeed at the time of the next full moon Lawrence is transformed and goes on a bloody rampage. In his portrayal of Talbot Del Toro pays homage to Chaney almost to the point of imitation. Unfortunately this results in a neutered and muted character. Like Chaneys Talbot Del Toros interpretation is that of a man tortured and filled with self-loathing. However the emotional connection is not there. As a human being Talbot generates no empathy; the character fails to excite our emotions. The filmmakers have surrounded Del Toro with a respectable supporting staff but it amounts to a waste of talent. Anthony Hopkins in his second classic horror remake (he was Van Helsing in Francis Ford Coppolas Dracula) pops up now and again looking malevolent but Sir John is more a necessity of the plot than a legitimate character. Emily Blunts thankless role as the ""love interest"" limits her screen time and her opportunity to look fetching in 19th century garb. With the exception of one scene she functions as underused eye candy. As a Scotland Yard inspector assigned to investigate the killings Hugo Weaving defines superfluous. The Wolfman had been searching for a director for some time before Johnston was brought on board. His experience with Jumanji and Jurassic Park III convinced the producers he could handle a film with a high number of special effects sequences and a sizeable budget. At best the results are mixed. 20 years ago the effects work in The Wolfman might have been hailed as revolutionary; today it looks dated. The violence is bloody and graphic but it doesnt make the movie better merely R-rated. Attempts to re-create the originals haunting atmosphere are middling - something is lost in the transition from black amp; white to color. Even more so than Coppolas Dracula Branaghs Frankenstein and Sommers The Mummy The Wolfman seems unnecessary. Although not coming close to the level of a misfire that represented Van Helsing this production nevertheless illustrates that it takes more to remake a beloved classic than re-working the story and taking a by-the-numbers approach. There are enough little details to indicate that the filmmakers were familiar with the original. Such familiarity did not result in a better product and the well-publicized re-shoots didnt save the movie from the graveyard of mediocrity into which its unintentional campiness and underwhelming special effects have consigned it.

"The Wolfman Howlingly bad wolf back at the door | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Wolfman Howlingly bad wolf back at the doorThis Wolfman is a howler but not in a good way.Benicio del Toro walks in the paw prints of Lon Chaney in poorly scripted remake of the 1941 horror classic that spawned a string of werewolf movies over the years.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Bruce DemaraEntertainment WriterFri. Feb. 12 2010 Starring Benicio Del Toro Anthony Hopkins Hugo Weaving. Joe Johnston director. 91 minutes. Major theatres. 18A This Wolfman is a howler but not in a good way.Its a shame really because this modern remake of sorts of the 1941 horror classic of the same name has a lot going for it starting with the inspired choice of Benicio Del Toro in the lead as the doomed Lawrence Talbot (the name shared by Lon Chaney Jr. in the original).Article Continued BelowDel Toro is a serious actor and his doleful soulful face is the perfect visage for a man in his predicament a prodigal son who returns to the family estate in northern England after a long estrangement to help in the search for his missing brother and instead encounters something that goes ruff in the night.A steely-eyed Hugo Weaving decked out in muttonchops brings a nice air of authority and menace to the role of Inspector Abberline of Scotland Yard who finds himself slumming it far from the Big Smoke (London) to track down a peculiarly strange and savage killer. Director Joe Johnston gets much of the period detail right in his recreation of the misty realm of Blackmoor (a name unlikely to encourage much day-tripping tourism). He assembles a motley cast of backward unwashed villagers who are aptly homely in that archetypically British way.The sets include the venerable but sinister Talbot Hall whose walls are festooned with the trophy heads of exotic species and a dreary countryside where ruins both old and Stonehenge ancient rise forbiddingly out of the fog. The costumes are spot on and the score appropriately moody allowing a nice buildup of creepy tension as the moon inches towards full. But the script by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self is a major let-down a veritable dogs breakfast of inconsistencies and improbable plot twists with an IQ level on par with the average slow-witted pre-teen male who will doubtlessly make up a substantial portion of the films audience.The romance between Talbot and his late brothers fiancee played by Emily Blunt never really sizzles but that seems more a fault of circumstance (read the script) than the actors.Sir Anthony Hopkins playing the dottily enigmatic pater familias - whose cryptic pronouncements include ""Never look back. The past is a wilderness of horrors"" - is another disappointment a performance with too much ham and not enough hound.The gore is plentiful the special effects so-so. ""Sometimes the way of fate is a cruel one"" intones a wizened old gypsy woman (played by Geraldine Chaplin) as if she foresees the deluge of bad reviews that destiny has in store.Despite strong production values and initial promise The Wolfman is another example of why in the case of revered horror classics its better to let some sleeping dogs lie.Related story Tracking the Wolfman The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

He takes a deep breath. It turns out to be his last. Yes that furry face seen in an almost subliminal flash was the feral beast lurking within ""The Wolfman"" a film that begins in an eerie gothic mist of suggestion--and turns into a toothless exercise in the obvious. Watch a clip from ""The Wolfman"" about a man who is cursed starring Benicio Del Toro Emily Blunt and Anthony Hopkins. Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. This updating of the old Universal horror franchise is among the more visually beautiful fright films ever photographed and all the more disappointing for it. Directed by Joe Johnston (""Hidalgo"" ""October Sky"" ""The Rocketeer"") the movie is scary only as regards all its wasted potential--the color-drained unnerving look; the inky black accents; the deliberate pacing; the occasional hint that the director understands the potency of implication. Its all here in grains and drams. So is an accelerating sense of inanity as all the movies elements are reduced to a gruesome fondue accessorized by actorly ham and studio cheese. It may be that this ""Wolfman""--which revives a storyline based more on Hollywood mythology than any particular ethnic fable--was misshapen from the cradle. The usually admirable Benicio Del Toro portraying Victorian stage actor/lycanthrope-to-be Lawrence Talbot is the worst casting choice in recent memory Too old and plush to play the Byronic hero hes also burdened with a modified Moe Howard haircut and a voice that loses us at ""Hello""--a greeting that Mr. Del Toro delivers with all the authority and resonance of the Kim Jong Il marionette in the South Park teams ""Team America."" (Im sorry; I cant get him out of my mind). Mr. Del Toros Talbot returning to his familys ancestral mansion in 1891 Blackmoor finds that his missing brothers shredded corpse has been discovered in a drainage ditch and that his father (Anthony Hopkins) has apparently been dipping into the laudanum cabinet. As his fellow Blackmoorites fueled by vigilante instincts and invective from the pulpit pursue the ""local lunatic"" Lawrence transitions from hunter to hunted A bite from the marauding creature dooms him to a future as a hairy homicidal maniac one who can remove the limbs heads and even hearts of his pursuers so quickly he can barely be seen. ENLARGE Benicio Del Toro as The Wolfman. Universal Pictures Eventually the Wolfman like his movie slows down--what good is state-of-the-art makeup and effects if no one gets to study them? Unlike the succession of glass plates used in 1941s ""The Wolf Man"" through which we viewed the moon-induced metamorphosis of Lon Chaney Jr. it is computerized orthopaedics that accomplish Lawrences transition from man to wolf His limbs contort his face is twisted into a befanged grimace his fingers sprout claws the size of fish knives. In keeping with wolfish tradition its an agonizing process which may account for the creatures ill temper upon becoming fully lupine He doesnt kill to feed any need besides bloodlust and his eviscerations are graphic grotesque and largely unnecessary--although when Mr. Del Toro is seen chowing down on some villagers liver it may be intended as an homage to his somnambulistic co-star Mr. Hopkins (hold the fava beans). There are other allusions--to waterboarding during a scene in which Lawrence is subjected to the primitive therapies of an asylum quack; to religious extremism when the local preacher ascribes the crimes of the Wolfman to divine retribution for unspecified sins. Emily Blunt who ought to be perplexed finding herself in a movie so unhinged is the only human element here thats remotely convincing plausible or attractive; shes sexier than ever as the dead brothers fiancee and gives a subtle performance amid a din of dramatic braying. Ultimately though ""The Wolfman"" is a horror thriller that couldnt have been made any worse by the addition of Abbott amp; Costello. ""Sometimes the way of fate is a cruel one"" mutters ""The Wolfmans"" standard-issue Maria Ouspenskaya-inspired creepy gypsy woman (a befossiled Geraldine Chaplin). No kidding lady. Despite a solid conceit a rather Bronte-esque Ms. Blunt and sufficient computer effects to amuse James Cameron this ""Wolfman"" is enough to make your hair fall out. Valentines Day Speaking of horror director Garry Marshalls latest atrocity ""Valentines Day"" might be described as a Repression-Era Special--an econo-pak of Hollywood second- and third-stringers a couple of genuine stars (Anne Hathaway Julia Roberts) and a couple of annoying movie kids brought together by a poverty of ideas and a director whose only apparent instruction to his cast was ""Act like the people in TV commercials."" With enough sticky sweetness to make your teeth ache ""Valentines Day"" deploys every rom-com cliche minus the com--theres isnt a laugh in the movie unless you count a fleeting sequence featuring comedian Larry Miller whos also probably the least prominent member of the cast (which includes Bradley Cooper Emma Roberts Jessica Alba Patrick Dempsey Shirley MacLaine Hector Elizondo Queen Latifah and George Lopez). ENLARGE Jennifer Garner plays Julia Fitzpatrick in Valentines Day. Warner Bros. Pictures If that lineup wasnt frightening enough Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner are the ostensible leads she a schoolteacher blissfully unaware that her boyfriend (Mr. Dempsey) is married; he a flower-shop owner who has just proposed bedside to his girlfriend (Ms. Alba) who apparently has someone do her hair while she sleeps. The foreshadowings are like billboards When a movie woman looks thoughtful rather than delirious at the sight of an engagement ring things dont bode well for the match. Neither does an affiancing that arrives so early in the story. As each character negotiates his/her own rocky road to romance each of the interlocking episodes inflicts its own particular kind of pain on the viewer who will wonder how any of this happened. So might the performers who will have a few questions for the gods and their agents Taylor Swift the multiple-Grammy-winning singer is nothing short of mortifying as a ditzy high-school student in love with another Taylor (""Twilights"" Mr. Lautner). Jamie Foxx continues his post-""Ray"" slide into self-parody. Topher Grace makes the world safe for innocuous ingenues. Director Marshall grand poobah of the puerile and pandering creates a shameless movie world for which no actor had to travel too far from home in Beverly Hills/Brentwood no one seemed to have worked more than a day to complete his or her abbreviated role and where Jessica Biel cant get a date. Right. Red the hue that dominates this movies palette is the color associated with both Valentines Day and the devil. And theres something vaguely satanic about ""Valentines Day."" Ajami ENLARGE Fouad Habash as Nasri in Ajami. coming If a movie can ever be perfect it may be so only in its particular moment. This is ""Ajami""s moment. An Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film this Arab-Israeli drama set on the mean streets of Jaffa is an urgent immediate jarring-but-fluid multicharacter portrayal of Arab life in an Israel ghetto (the hood of the title) where a drive-by killing provides the overture to a city-wide opera of revenge death drugs and star-crossed love. The co-directors/co-writers Palestinian Scandar Copti and Israeli Yaron Shani possess a Tarantino-esque blitheness about startling violence and employ a ""Pulp Fiction"" approach to narrative-as-mosaic. But they also advance the technique of fracturing time using the backward glances into their sad sad stories as a way of revealing details that enrich and alter the viewers perspective on whats happening among the movies largely Arabic population. While the disposability of life on screen mirrors the disposability of life on the Ajami streets ones immediate impulse is to describe the film as apolitical Its conflicts after all are largely tribal insular and produced by the Arabs own pressure-cooker mentality. But of course nothing could be more political. Red Riding Trilogy It may lack vampires and blue people but the already much-discussed ""Red Riding Trilogy"" is perhaps the moviegoing event of the year. Adapted by Tony Grisoni from David Peaces four novels based on the 70s-80s Yorkshire Ripper murders its an all-star showcase for contemporary British/Irish acting and the gifts of Julian Jarrold James Marsh and Anand Tucker who directed parts one two and three respectively. Terrific performances are turned in by leads Paddy Considine (part 2) and David Morrissey (part 3) but it is Andrew Garfield--as the young reporter who suspects that the Ripper case is being used as a cover for a child-sex ring involving the entirety of a sordid Yorkshire constabulary--who establishes himself as one of the more gifted young actors around. Reminiscent of the best British TV crime series (""Prime Suspect"" to name one) ""RRT"" delves far deeper into the heart of darkness than its predecessors have ventured or where most contemporary filmmakers dare to go. Produced by and aired last year on the U.K.s Channel Four it is taut disturbing wonderfully awful and at 307 minutes epic. ""Red Riding"" will eventually wend its way back to the small screen but can continue to be seen in the proportions it deserves at the IFC Center in Manhattan or beginning today at the Nuart in West Los Angeles. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD Focus ENLARGE The Wolf Man (1941) The first in Lon Chaney Jr.s string of Wolf Man appearances features the formidable cast of Claude Rains Ralph Bellamy Bela Lugosi and of course Maria Ouspenskaya who basically tells Chaneys Larry Talbot that hes doomed. The story is by the German-born Curt Siodmak several of whose novels (""Donovans Brain"" ""The Beast With Five Fingers"") were turned into movies and whose ""Wolf Man"" script extrapolated from a number of legends and employed the famous verse ""Even a man who is pure in heart / And says his prayers by night / May become a Wolf when the Wolfbane blooms / And the Moon is full and bright."" ENLARGE An American Werewolf in London (1981) Among the many werewolf knockoffs (""I Was a Teenage Werewolf"" ""The Werewolf"" ""Werewolf Woman"") is this quasicomic take from John (""Animal House"") Landis in which a backpacking American tourist (David Naughton) is bitten by a creature that none of the locals will admit exists. All the songs titles by the way contain the word ""moon"" (""Bad Moon Rising"" ""Moondance"" ""Blue Moon"" etc). ENLARGE Wolf (1994) Casting Jack Nicholson as a wolfish man doesnt seem much of a stretch but director Mike Nichols working from a script by Jim Harrison and Wesley Strick created an extended metaphor for American business and American manhood by moving the werewolf legend into the publishing world. There traditionalist book publisher Will Randall (Nicholson) is under siege by a ruthless media mogul (Christopher Plummer) and an underhanded rival (James Spader). Under siege that is until a werewolf bite turns Will into a corporate cutthroat sexual beast and type AAA personality. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"The Wolfman - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW The WolfmanThe classic story of a man cursed with becoming a beast squanders the talents of Benicio Del Toro Anthony Hopkins and others.February 12 2010|By BETSY SHARKEY | Film Critic Heres the surprise of the new incarnation of ""The Wolfman"" starring Benicio Del Toro -- there isnt one. No bite either or humor or camp. And the real killer . . . almost no spine-tingling dread. So I guess this is a kind of a horror story after all. Also starring and squandering the talents of Anthony Hopkins Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving the film is built around the ancient myth of the cursed creature -- part man part wolf part of the time -- who battles to control the monster he discovers inside. But if you think the wolfman is conflicted thats nothing compared with the filmmakers. When it comes to creating a horror movie there is always that critical first fork in the road Do you go with intellect and irony like the recent ""Sherlock Holmes"" for example or opt for camp like the ""Scream"" series or try for grown-up terror like ""The Exorcist"" or teen terror A  la""Friday the 13th"" or descend into the torture porn of ""Hostel"" or ""Saw""? If you do it well it doesnt much matter which path you choose but you do need to choose and theres no indication that director Joe Johnston ever did. Im sure it didnt help that Johnston came to the party late after director Mark Romanek left just before filming started for murky reasons that remain more of a mystery than anything on screen. The story he inherited uses Curt Siodmaks script of the classic 1941 ""The Wolf Man"" as a foundation with Andrew Kevin Walker (""Se7en"") and David Self (""Road to Perdition"") two guys who should know their way around dark drama brought in to thicken the plot. Set among the dark moors decaying estates and gypsy curses of 1890s England ""The Wolfman"" is a re-imagining of old-fashioned horror of a type that existed long before it would become a rich revenue vein that Hollywood has since strip-mined. That may be partly why the film has no teeth. In the new telling Del Toros Lawrence a British noblemans son has been living in the States with his aunt since the childhood trauma of seeing his mother with her throat slashed. Now grown hes an actor starring in the road tour of some play when news of his brothers disappearance reaches him. Del Toros dark brooding looks and heavy brows do work to his advantage though little else does. (You have to wonder if the U.S. auntie and the acting gig were contrived to cover that hes the only major figure in the cast without a passable British accent.) Lawrence gets the bad news in a letter from his brothers fiancA(c)e Gwen (Blunt) and returns to the home of his birth a cobweb-covered manse near a town called Blackmoor where his father Sir John (Hopkins) and his Indian servant Singh (Art Malik) still live. Though Lawrence seems to have a good head on his shoulders he heads out late one night for a nearby encampment of gypsies because thats where any wolfman investigation always starts. But guess whos coming to dinner? Theres a major battle entrails are scattered everywhere -- the gore will be too little for some too much for others -- Lawrence is wounded and before you know it hes struggling with his primal urges. The rest of the film unfolds in both predictable and problematic ways. The father-son issues between Lawrence and Sir John a key piece of the puzzle here are mostly tedious. The insane-asylum scenes (dont ask) get lost in trying to make some kind of social statement about how barbaric the 1890s were. And I wont even bore you with the Gwen-Lawrence love story because the movie will take care of that for me. But youre asking what about the actual ""wolfman?"" Well cool special effects from master effects maker Rick Baker as man transmogrifies into wolf -- a painful process with bones teeth and hair growing crazy fast. The director metes out the image in small doses I guess trying to inject surprise into the proceedings starting with just a whoosh and a blur. Then its fingers into claws teeth into fangs then legs into wolf-legs? When the beast is finally revealed hes fearsome.

The film is set in rural Victorian England in a fall where the skies are the color of lead the woods exude a primal spookiness and the harvest moon blazes like the lantern of an onrushing train. The editing moves at a stately pace evoking an agonizing sense of dread. Joe Johnston best known for light crowd-pleasers like ""Jumanji"" and ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" aims for grim gravitas here as in Francis Ford Coppolas ""Dracula"" and Kenneth Branaghs ""Frankenstein."" When the blood begins to flow -- fly actually -- the gruesome tableaux are worthy of an art gallery slide show. Impaling on an iron fence a white swanlike neck bisected by a straight razor steaming viscera torn out by fangs -- its a splatter film with a genius art director. In this era of reboots and reimaginings ""The Wolfman"" sticks close to the classic story adding psychological notes and oddly political references to the legend. Benicio Del Toro his heavy face echoing Lon Chaney Jr. plays the doomed Lawrence Talbot here a Shakespearean actor specializing in the tragedies. Labeled mad and ""fragile"" as a child he was shipped off to an aunt in America by his domineering father. His brothers death at the claws of something brutal and violent brings both Del Toro and his brothers fiancee Emily Blunt to Blackmoor the isolated family estate. They are welcomed with ambiguous hospitality by Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins). Hes a portly bearded big game hunter with the manner of a sinister Santa Claus and a flair for pronouncements like ""Never look back; the past is a wilderness of horrors."" If he looks to his guests like hes chuckling over some nasty private joke its because he is. There are twisted roots to the Talbot family tree that justify Del Toros expression of inner torment. The screenplay repeatedly notes that the line between man and beast is not always clear and as computer-generated effects turn human hands into gnarled claws and mouths into foam-flecked muzzles the film wallows in the horror of deformity and disfigurement. Most locals scapegoat the Gypsies and their dancing bear for master Talbots mutilation but some mutter about a werewolf and soon the blacksmith has a busy sideline melting heirloom silverware into bullets. Hugo Weaving glowers as the Scotland Yard detective assigned to the case. Monstrous mysteries are his specialty; he last led the hunt for Jack the Ripper. After a scarring encounter with the lycanthrope Del Toro inherits the curse. In the films best passage he is confined to a dungeon-like asylum where a smarmy psychologist prescribes submersion in ice baths and electroshock to cure his ""delusions."" Del Toros explosive reaction proves that the textbook approach to an absurd claim isnt always the correct one. Universal Pictures Star Tribune Benicio Del Toro in ""The Wolfman"" While the production design is a sumptuous swirl of eerie and disturbing Victoriana theres a 21st-century subtext to the legend. The characters back story hinges on a bloody encounter in ""the Hindu Kush"" the British imperialists name for eastern Afghanistan and Del Toros sessions of medical torture look a lot like the CIAs ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" for al Qaeda suspects. Theres also a ripe strain of Oedipal conflict simmering between Hopkins and Del Toro and morbid sexual repression in his yearning for his late brothers betrothed. Theres plenty of bloodletting but Johnston and his collaborators know that the real stabs of fear come in those long nerve-racking moments when the finger hovers over the panic button.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Wolfman  out of four Stars Benicio Del Toro Anthony Hopkins Emily Blunt Hugo WeavingDirector Joe JohnstonDistributor Universal PicturesRating R for bloody horror violence and goreRunning time 2 hours 5minutesOpens Friday nationwide The Wookiee-- er The Wolfman-- is inspired by the classic werewolf tale but the shaggy beast bears more resemblance to Chewbacca than to Lon Chaney Jr. Theres not much to recommend this dull cheerless and not very scary re-imagining of the classic 1941 film. On the plus side theres new vocabulary to learn. The key word to emerge from dusty tomes is ""lycanthropy"" a psychosis in which a person has delusions of being a wild animal. A lycanthrope is a mythological human with the ability to shape-shift into a wolf-like creature. So is the exiled British nobleman Lawrence Talbot (a miscast Benicio Del Toro) a bona fide lycanthrope or is he delusional suffering from lycanthropy? More important does anyone really care? The wolfman lore in this version shape-shifts into a new story with familiar trappings. The setting is a handsomely re-created Victorian England. The cobwebby confines of Lawrences family mansion are appropriately eerie set amid a dark and gloomy heath. Local villagers are terrified of a brutal creature that roams the countryside killing indiscriminately. Del Toro is the lone cast member without a British accent and its an odd choice that diminishes the believability of the overall saga. His American English is eventually explained away when we learn that he left his family estate as a boy. He was sent to live with American relatives shortly after seeing his mother killed. But it takes a while for his back story to emerge. PHOTO GALLERY Del Toro becomes the Wolfman When Lawrence hears about the disappearance of his brother he returns to his ancestral home in the British village of Blackmoor. He is consumed by the need to find out what happened to his brother. But he should know better than to go mucking about on the moors. No good can come of that. Soon we see an American Werewolf in London-type transformation from ordinary man to shaggy four-footed brute. Cool as that effect looked back in 1981 it seems dated and derivative nearly 30 years later. And the film relies heavily on fake scares from sudden sounds and surprise movements rather than true suspense. The werewolves seen most recently on screen were Twilights buff crew so Del Toros Wolfman wont inspire swoons. Hes just big and hairy. Emily Blunt as Gwen Lawrences tamped-down flame appears dourly resigned. Only Anthony Hopkins as Lawrences malevolent father seems to throw himself into the part chewing the scenery with inexplicable vigor. What emerges is a banal horror film and a tepid action-adventure. What was the purpose in dusting off a Gothic classic only to mount such a mediocre adaptation?

"Wolfman movie review Remake is fine until it deviates from original |       NJ.com comments Wolfman movie review Remake is fine until it deviates from original Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 11 2010 at 440 PM updated February 11 2010 at 450 PM View/Post Comments Inspired by the classic Universal film that launched a legacy of horror ""The Wolfman"" brings the myth of a cursed man back to its iconic origins. Even a film that is full of art and has previews by night can become a problem when the fans complain and the studio gets a fright. That at least is the lesson of ""The Wolfman"" reboot a movie that has gone through more transformations than Lon Chaney Jr. The director changed a month before start. The script was revised. Then after early screenings there were weeks of reshoots. Fan sites reported different scores editors release dates - and drastically different running times. (Not though a studio publicist e-mailed me the other day different makeup despite stories Id read - and repeated - from the British press. That at least he swore had always remained the same.) The Wolfman (R) Universal (102 min.)Directed by Joe Johnston. With Benicio Del Toro Emily Blunt Anthony Hopkins. Now playing in New Jersey.Stephen Whittys rating Two and a half starsRating note The film contains gore and graphic violence. Its not the kind of publicity buildup any studio wants. And Universal (which has hopes of reviving its various monster franchises) wasnt happy to see it all out there on the blogs. But the funny thing is all the bad press probably helped by lowering expectations. Go see ""The Wolfman"" now half-dreading a disaster and you may actually be pleasantly surprised. The film goes right when it follows the bare bones of the original 1941 movie. Alienated son Lawrence Talbot returns to his English home after years in America to comfort his father after a family tragedy. One night Larry is bitten by a strange monstrous animal. And then one full moon later Larry becomes an animal himself. Where the film goes wrong is where it tries to improve on things. Moving the action back to the Victorian era isnt a bad idea; bringing in a real-life Scotland Yard inspector (the same historical character who staggered through ""From Hell"") is not. Nor are its additions to lycanthropic lore welcome. We still have the Gypsy caravans but this time it appears the curse has its real origin in the subcontinent and in the bite of a ""strange feral child"" - a gnomelike little fellow who looks like Gollums ugly brother. This is not an improvement on the original story. Nor is the second act which has the cursed Talbot heir brought to London for a psychiatric ""cure"" (and given electroshocks) until he escapes over the rooftops and then walks several hundred miles home. But Rick Bakers werewolf design - a combination of his own ""American Werewolf in London"" morphing and Roy Ashtons makeup for Oliver Reed in ""The Curse of the Werewolf"" - is quite wonderful. So is Rick Heinrichs production work which like his sets for Tim Burtons ""Sleepy Hollow"" re-creates the old Hammer Studios mood. Benicio Del Toro is as always interesting to watch as the tortured shape-shifter (I wonder if he ever thought it would come to this when he was playing Duke the Dog-Faced Boy in ""Big Top Pee-Wee""?) and Emily Blunt is pleasant as his pretty prey. Having the most fun as usual is Anthony Hopkins who chews the scenery with vigor as his dad. Less vigorous is the direction by Joe Johnston a longtime effects guy (he began his career on ""Star Wars"" - the first one). Hes been making his own films for years but he still seems to like tricks more than imagery; there are dozens of shots of CGI-swirling clouds but few striking shots. Nor is there much drama with the real family conflicts at the storys core never truly confronted. ""The Wolfman"" is hardly ONeill but it always had subtexts of alpha-male dominance sexual repression compulsive behavior and father-son feuds. Johnston runs so fast away from all of it youd think it was wolfsbane. Not that most monster fans will care of course or even expect much more after all the bad buzz. Theyll be simply happy to see foggy forests and muttering Gypsies again slashing claws and scattered entrails. And a new wolfman at last - whose hair at least is perfect.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + AwROOOOoooo What are dignified award-worthy thespians like Benicio del Toro Emily Blunt and Sir Anthony Hopkins doing in a piece of old-school hokum like ""The Wolfman? Having the time of their lives while trying to keep a straight face. The movie is by no means good but its surprisingly enjoyable a misty moody Saturday-matinee monster-chiller-horror special that hits the same sweet spot for moviegoers of a certain age (cough) as those snap-together Frankenstein model kits from the late 1960s. You can practically smell the Duco cement.Of course the Wolfman was always the poor relation of the Universal Studio horror crew. The Frankenstein monster and Dracula got there first and had defining stars in Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi; 1935s ""Werewolf of London had the dull-as-dirt Henry Hull. (Nifty transformation scene though and points for inspiring Warren Zevon.) It was only with 1941s ""The Wolfman that movie lycanthropy got a face poor hulking Lon Chaney Jr. who always suggested a football player whod been forced to take over the family watchmaking business. That first ""Wolfman isnt a very good movie either so its not like the new one is sullying hallowed ground.On the contrary director Joe Johnston (""Honey I Shrunk the Kids) and writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self working from Curt Siodmaks 1941 script treat the hairy old cliches with reverence. Set in 1891 in the fictional hamlet of Blackmoor England the new ""Wolfman lets the fog machines rip from frame one and every time an offscreen wolf howls you may find yourself giggling uncontrollably.In an inspired casting touch Benicio del Toro stars as Lawrence Talbot a traveling actor returning to his ancestral manse to bury his brother (Simon Merrells) and confront the family demons. Since del Toro already looks like the missing link - he has a hairline lower than Butch Patrick on ""The Munsters - this gives the makeup team only half the work to do.Hopkins staggers merrily around as the unfathomably decadent Sir John Talbot cradling a gun as if he were re-enacting his post-stroke scenes from ""Legends of the Fall. With tremulous conviction Blunt plays Gwen Conliffe the brothers fiancee whos drawn to the tormented Lawrence after hes bitten one eldritch evening and starts staring fixedly at her neck. Since the original films Maria Ouspenskaya is long dead - not that that would have stopped her from chewing the scenery - Geraldine Chaplin has been drafted to play the aged Gypsy woman Maleva issuing dire warnings and asking Gwen ""Vill you condemn him or vill you set him free?One caveat Because this is the 21st century and the multiplex circus demands blood the new ""Wolfman is trendily gory. The violence erupts in brief visceral spasms rather than prolonged wallowing and I was cheered to see the Wolfman tear loose a victims liver in one scene like a dog going straight for the Liv-a-Snaps. Mostly though Johnston busies himself with atmosphere and mood; this is a more faithful updating of Universal horror tropes than the recent ""Mummy desecrations and it has its very real if goofy pleasures.The transformation scenes come courtesy of makeup effects legend Rick Baker who doesnt dwell on the details as he did in 1981s ""An American Werewolf in London. Theyre shown off best in the movies strongest scene in which Talbot is trussed to a chair in a medical amphitheater surrounded by Victorian doctors curious to see what happens when the full moon rises. (The payoff is delicious - for Lawrence.) As with all monster movies though the more you see the sillier it gets and the climax of ""The Wolfman with two Oscar-winning actors in fur masks going at it tooth and talon plays like a tussle at the pound.Del Toro sadly is a bit of a dud in the title role reciting his ornate period dialogue in an embarrassed monotone. Or maybe hes just channeling Lon Chaney Jr. Hard to say. ""The Wolfman knows the old horror classics had pure pulp running through their veins and it honors those cheap thrills with gusto.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Vampires and werewolves have long held a grip on our horrific imaginings with good reason They get the job done. Sure other monsters have had their moments and zombies remain a reliable stand-in for the mounting sociological problems of any era. But when it comes to more personal demons werewolves and vampires cover the bases. Vampires make apt doubles for the forces that threaten to seduce and corrupt us. Werewolves represent the beasts already within and all the attendant rage and lust we hide. The best moments of The Wolfman--a remake of the 1941 Lon Chaney Jr. classic--get that. When its werewolves get to rampaging the film delivers a succession of literally visceral shocks. ""Hell rip your lungs out Jim"" Warren Zevon warned in ""Werewolves Of London."" In the hands of director Joe Johnston and writer Andrew Kevin Walker (Seven) and David Self (Road To Perdition) these monsters dont stop with the lungs. The violence here is brutal brief and squishy. Wolves dont waste time. If only the film around those scenes didnt feel equally gutted. Special-effects veteran Rick Baker--whose werewolf experience stretches back to The Howling and An American Werewolf In London--has designed a beast worthy of awe and wonder but his wolf-man has more personality than The Wolfman. In a performance that relies on the same cryptic remove as his work in Che Benicio Del Toro plays a successful American actor who while touring his native England gets news of his brothers violent death and returns to the home of his long-estranged father (Anthony Hopkins). Surrounded by late-Victorian decrepitude he begins to recall some long-suppressed childhood trauma as he befriends his brothers widow (Emily Blunt). Its no accident that Del Toros homecoming interrupts his successful run in Hamlet. Johnstons film piles on Oedipal discomfort as its hero gets closer to the truth of his brothers death an investigation interrupted by an unfortunate animal attack and its aftereffects. But the story feels thinned-out as if merely establishing the elements of a fur-covered family melodrama were enough. No simpering Lon Chaney Jr. Del Toro underplays the part and the choice leaves his character removed from the action with only hints of heat offered in his scenes with Hopkins and Blunt. Apart from a few sequences where he simply looks bored Hopkins runs in the other direction suggesting the overheated film that might--and probably should--have been. A few stray livers and severed heads aside this is a monster too polite for its own good.

His makeup mostly old-school prosthetics and fur with just a dash of computer-generated accents is fantastic - nostalgically hokey and still cutting edge. The man-to-beast transformation scenes which are surprisingly brief are also greatly effective if not quite so elaborate or revolutionary as the ones John Landis achieved in his seminal 1981 horror comedy An American Werewolf in London. But the rest of A Puerto Rican Werewolf in London - I mean The Wolfman - is done in by a fatal lack of purpose. Director Joe Johnston (Hidalgo Jumanji) ladles on the mood and atmosphere This is the sort of movie in which the woods are always shrouded in fog and shadow and the moon looms impossibly large. The production design is impeccable Theres no faulting the movies art direction. But Johnston fails to make a story set in 1891 England relevant to contemporary audiences. Why not set it in present-day London? Why retell this woefully familiar tale at all? There are some new albeit disappointingly telegraphed plot twists in the script by Andrew Kevin Walker (Seven) and David Self (Road to Perdition) but theyre not enough to distract you from the fact that youre watching a remake of an old infinitely superior movieand you keep wondering what the point was. No metaphors or subtexts regarding the beast that lurks within the hearts of men or sexual repression or the rampaging id - nothing but a superficial gloss on well-worn material. The film isnt quite so redundant as Gus Van Sants shot-for-shot remake of Psycho but it comes close. With the exception of Hugo Weavings Scotland Yard detective who investigates a recent string of murders apparently committed by a wild animal the performances in The Wolfman all feel as if the actors were playing dress-up. The usually resourceful and vibrant Del Toro is muted and disengaged as Lawrence Talbot an actor who returns to his hometown just outside London after his brothers mysterious death. As Lawrences father Anthony Hopkins hams things up so ferociously you wonder if the monstrous creature roaming the moors is a wild pig. And the talented Emily Blunt is saddled with the most perfunctory Token Love Interest role of all time - Gwen Conliffe the former girlfriend of the dead brother who immediately starts making cow eyes at Lawrence even though the corpse of her ex is still warm. A tender scene in which Lawrence and Gwen discover a mutual attraction while hes teaching her how to skip stones across a pond is so dull and perfunctory I started wishing the filmmakers would throw in a surprise homage to the scene in Frankenstein in which the monster throws a little girl into a lake. For an R-rated horror film The Wolfman is also surprisingly light on scares - and when I say light I mean completely devoid of them. This movie wouldnt scare an impressionable 5-year-old girl whos afraid of the monster under her bed. OK thats not really true. The Wolfman would probably freak that little girl out especially during a scene in which the rampaging werewolf leaves a pile of entrails and severed limbs in his wake. But theres a dispiritingly rote and uninvolving air about The Wolfman that keeps the movie from being the slightest bit frightening for anyone old enough to see it. All the atmospherics big-budget Hollywood can muster will never fill the void left by a weak story and there wasnt a moment in The Wolfman during which I believed anything I was watching. The editing also feels choppy as if large chunks of the film had been excised during the year-long delay before its release. In the best scene some doctors and psychiatrists who think Talbot is a mere lunatic and not really a monster strap him to a chair as the full moon rises to prove their case and Del Toro bellows ""Tonight I will kill all of you"" before sprouting fangs and claws and proceeding almost to fulfill his promise. The scene - a large group of frightened people trapped inside a locked room with a crazed monster - is fun and original and exciting. The rest of The Wolfman which must have the limpest ending ever to grace a werewolf picture is about as frightening as a Benji sequel ... the one in which he got rabies.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Thursday February 11 2010 207 PM Title The Wolfman If youre going to pick the werewolf as your favorite monster theres a lot to appreciate in the shaggy imperfect but still fun new version of ""The Wolf Man."" Horror aficionados who are pure of heart know how that specific title has been used only once before -- for the 1941 Lon Chaney Jr. version -- and this loose remake of that classic is aware of its legacy something missing from other horror reboots.Theres also an old dark house secret tunnels superstitious townsfolk investigators with muttonchops and gypsies with talismans. If director Joe Johnston (who took over this troubled production from Mark Romanek) gets a bit too serious about all of this that too can be appreciated as a throwback the same way his bi-ped monster has a retro hair-sprouting claw-growing style.In 1891 Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) the black sheep son of creepy aristocrat Sir John (Anthony Hopkins) is called back to the familys English estate when his brother goes missing. Lawrences almost sister-in-law (Emily Blunt) beckons him but a curse awaits on the moors. After hes bitten by a creature during an attack on a gypsy camp Lawrence becomes half-man half-animal when the moon is full. And thats not the only secret Talbot mansion holds.Much of ""The Wolfman"" is silly yet it mostly embraces that including its all-this-and-that-too explanation of the werewolfs origin. When it takes itself seriously - such as when much is made of Lawrence being a Shakespearean stage actor or in Blunts unfortunately overwrought scenes - its pigfooted. A double-werewolf smackdown feels too much like ""Van Helsing"" a scene in London is nearly wasted and Geraldine Chaplin as the old gypsy Maleva is frankly no Maria Ouspenskaya.But when Del Toro haunted from the get-go and that old dancing bear Hopkins start to face-off in shadowy rooms things get delightfully hairy. And makeup master Rick Baker (""An American Werewolf in London"") makes Del Toros final vest-and-pants-wearing lycanthrope scarier and less CGI than expected. For killing the tedium when youre in the company of werewolves thats as good as a silver bullet.

Comments The Wolfman Rated R  2010 There have been plenty of werewolf movies but incredibly this is the first-ever remake of Universals 1941 horror classic The Wolf Man. Perpetually haunted Benicio Del Toro makes a suitable successor to Lon Chaney Jr. in the role of Lawrence Talbot the innocent putz who survives a werewolf attack but then begins waking up in the morning with blood on his hands. Unfortunately screenwriters David Self (Road to Perdition) and Andrew Kevin Walker (Sleepy Hollow) have turned Talbots poignant relationship with his father (Claude Rains in the original) into something more sinister and pedestrian (with Anthony Hopkins phoning it in as the senior Talbot). But compared to Van Helsing (2004) Universals last exercise in high-decibel horror schlock this is fairly satisfying particularly a ghoulish episode in a Victorian insane asylum. Joe Johnston directed; with Emily Blunt and Hugo Weaving. R 103 min. By J.R.

"Movie review The Wolfman -- 3 stars - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movie review The Wolfman -- 3 starsNew edition takes a serious look at father-son issues instead of jokes gagsFebruary 11 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe new edition of the old Universal horror title ""The Wolfman"" constitutes a pleasant surprise if ""pleasant"" can be used to describe a brooding 100 million-plus diversion with this many beheadings and eviscerations. Director Joe Johnstons reboot is devoted to the pleasures of meticulous and insinuating period re-creation (1891 Blackmoor England plus a side trip to London) shot in a mixture of studio interiors (at the famed Shepperton Studios) and open-air location work. Doggedly or rather wolfishly the film doesnt go in for camp or mirth at least until its misjudged and semi-endless wolf-on-wolf climax. Benicio Del Toros Lawrence Talbot a famous Shakespearean actor in this version of the story broods and suffers and he is after all in physical torment for much of the story. In this version father-son issues take precedence over jokes about back hair. Anthony Hopkins plays Sir John Talbot ( Claude Rains in the 1941 original scripted by Curt Siodmak) whose son has disappeared. This disappearance brings Lawrence back into the family fold such as it is. Someone or something is on the loose slaughtering Gypsies and good upright Victorian English folk. When Lawrence is attacked and begins showing signs of trouble its his father who takes care of him though he seems strangely interested in letting ""the beast"" run free. Hopkins phones it in here albeit entertainingly He seems to have gone straight past ""relaxed and authoritative"" and landed in ""bored."" But everyone else is fiercely committed to taking the cockamamie mythology seriously. Emily Blunt? Perfect combination of Victorian restraint and sultry gazes as the fiancee of the missing brother. Hugo Weaving whose muttonchops foreshadow a certain transformation quite wittily makes for a formidable Scotland Yard foil. Geraldine Chaplin brings feral intensity to the Gypsy woman who has the lowdown on the curse. Its amazing this stuff works at all really. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self the movie had a troubled production development changing everything (directors editors composers) but its underwear en route to the multiplex. I think Johnston has saved it; he may have his weaknesses (so many scudding-clouds transitions) but he shapes the attack sequences with a sure sense of pacing. The film is extremely bloody. Im not sure who its for exactly It may be too somber for the teenagers and too splattery for others. Then again I went for it. ""You and 20 million other guys"" That was Lou Costellos retort to Lon Chaney Jr. in ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" when Chaney tells him the full moon turns him into a wolf. Thats precisely the sort of gag that you will not find here. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for bloody horror violence and gore) Cast Benicio Del Toro (Lawrence Talbot); Anthony Hopkins (Sir John); Emily Blunt (Gwen Conliffe); Hugo Weaving (Aberline); Geraldine Chaplin (Maleva); Art Malik (Singh) Credits Directed by Joe Johnston; written by Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self based on Curt Siodmaks 1941 screenplay; produced by Scott Stuber Benicio Del Toro Rick Yorn and Sean Daniel.

The Wolfman  1/2 Director Joe Johnston. Cast Benicio Del Toro Anthony Hopkins Emily Blunt. Rating R for bloody horror and violence. RELATED Werewolf movies Spotlight Benicio Del Toro Revisit the 1941 Universal Pictures classic sign up Benicio Del Toro Anthony Hopkins and Emily Blunt toss in Hugo Weaving for good measure - what could go wrong? A lot as it turns out. Del Toro is spectacularly miscast while Hopkins walks through much of the movie. Director Joe Johnston gives the film a satisfyingly spooky look and vibe throughout particularly scenes set in the woods at night with the bright light of a full moon as a backdrop. But the movie plays like a missed opportunity with its by-the-numbers scares and a story that feels disjointed hurried in some places slow in others. Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) an actor who has been living in America in the late 19th century arrives at his boyhood home in England to help find his missing brother Ben. Hes greeted after a fashion by his estranged father Sir John Talbot (Hopkins) an odd duck who informs Lawrence that his brother has turned up dead; does he have clothes for the funeral? Also staying in the crumbling pile is Gwen (Blunt) Bens fiance. Lawrence overhears gossip in a pub about Ben cavorting with gypsies. Surely they must be responsible for his death the locals say - perhaps the bear they keep is the culprit. Lawrence asks his father about it but he mostly warns him to stay inside because of the full moon that night. Instead Lawrence visits the gypsy camp where a strange fast-moving creature kills several people and wounds him. Not good as any late-night-movie fan knows. Oddly enough everyone else seems to know it too. Theres no suspense no question about the curse that has now befallen Lawrence. When the full moon rises hell turn into a wolflike creature that can only be killed by silver bullets. Abberline (Weaving) a Scotland Yard inspector arrives to question Lawrence who is healing awfully quickly for a man so gravely wounded. After one rampage the townspeople capture Lawrence who is placed in the asylum where he spent time as a boy after a traumatic event. Sir John visits with some disturbing revelations and an arrogant doctor (Michael Cronin) parades Lawrence before a medical theater with amusingly disastrous results. Yet this scene also raises questions Can the werewolf pick and choose his victims making rational choices? Or is he a mindless savage killing anyone and anything in front of him? The answer proves elusive. Gwen meanwhile sees hope for Lawrence. Or maybe she loves him even though she has known him only a short time and for most of that he has been a werewolf. Hard to say. (Insert animal-magnetism joke here.) Whatever the case Lawrence has feelings for her as well. But to say their relationship faces some challenges is to understate the case considerably. Del Toro doesnt seem to know how to play Lawrence so for the most part he doesnt really. He just plods from one scene to the next. The same is true of Hopkins who finally stirs a bit in the latter half of the film but by then its a little late. Blunt is fine in a limited though ultimately crucial role. Only Weaving seems as if hes really trying. There are things to like here. The look of the werewolf is nicely retro and the transformation scenes are well done (though they lack the crucial revelation of the ones in ""American Werewolf in London"" where we learn that the creatures howl is actually a cry of pain). And everything about the Talbot mansion exudes decay and decrepitude; the place reeks of doom. There is an interesting twist to the story but it presents more questions than it answers particularly when it comes to the motivation of one of the characters. And while there are frights and starts they are predictable. ""The Wolfman"" ends up a disappointment then somewhat interesting in places but nothing to howl about.

""Why so serious?"" would be an excellent question to direct at the makers of ""The Wolfman"" a high-toned bloody but otherwise bloodless effort to resurrect one of Universals venerable horror franchises for modern times. Approaching the matted-haired genre with a straight-faced studiousness befitting a bigscreen version of the Dead Sea Scrolls director Joe Johnston amp; Co. know how to startle with innumerable shock cuts but dont know how to build tension and intrigue or how to approach the job with a sense of fun and relish. Long-delayed and reworked Oedipal take on the lycanthropic condition should take a meaty opening-weekend B.O. bite but long-term prospects will certainly fall short of what must have been imagined when the project was launched. ""Youve done terrible things"" Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins) informs his son Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) the morning after the latter has transformed into a vicious beast for the first time and notably reduced the population of late Victorian England. Well hes not the only one in a tale that scripters Andrew Kevin Walker (""Seven"") and David Self (""Road to Perdition"") seem to intend as the ""Hamlet"" of werewolf movies given the woe that befalls multiple generations of the Talbot family and the torment suffered by the hair ... er heir apparent. Lo and behold Lawrence is a vaguely American-accented actor who is actually playing the brooding Dane on the British boards when hes called home to the village of Blackmoor upon the death of his older brother from ""unnatural wounds."" Having fled to the U.S. as a boy after his mothers violent demise Lawrence should well understand his fathers warning that ""the past is a wilderness of horrors"" but decides not to heed it when his brothers high-calorie cupcake of a fiancee Gwen (Emily Blunt) wants to know what really happened to her beau. Despite the concerns of his father an eccentric old coot who stalks around his vast estate carrying a shotgun and a gypsy fortune teller (Geraldine Chaplin) Lawrence ventures out under the full moon and gets mauled for his trouble. Strangely however his wounds heal quickly and he emerges stronger than ever so as to be ready for the next bright evening 28 nights hence. Once Lawrence becomes the Wolfman the mayhem comes fast and frequently -- in the countryside in London (to where Gwen has retreated -- and to where Hugo Weavings Scotland Yard inspector follows Lawrence) and even in a medical teaching theater where a temporarily subdued Lawrence becomes enraged like King Kong and breaks free to assault his examiners including the chief doctor (a marvelously oblivious Antony Sher). As with Kong and Frankensteins monster one is meant to respond to the pathos implicit in the tragedy of a mans soul being imprisoned in the body of a beast and Gwen does her best to try to break through to it even in the worst of times. But the emotion just isnt forthcoming. The werewolf attacks generally consist of abrupt cutaways to the face of the beast accompanied by a sudden roar then bites or more often slashing swipes by giant claws which leave human hamburger meat in their wake. The constant repetition of these shock tactics in lieu of genuine suspense makes ""The Wolfman"" feel cheap despite the vast amounts obviously spent on Rick Heinrichs opulent production design the extensive visual effects the more-than-effective special makeup effects (Rick Baker back on familiar turf) Milena Canoneros luxurious costumes Danny Elfmans insistent score and the tony cast. Del Toro is unquestionably hirsute enough for the role (although his haircut freakily comes within a whisker of resembling the ""Moe"" cut he may yet wear in the long-gestating ""Three Stooges"" opus) and he communicates the inner torment of one of natures unfortunates. But his manner is awkward caught mid-Atlantic somewhere like his accent and one would be curious to hear Lawrence recite a bit of ""Hamlet"" and observe how London audiences respond. Hopkins stops just short of raising his eyebrows through the roof and literally licking his chops as he rolls dire admonitions and ghastly revelations around in his mouth like samples of wine. Blunt is called upon to look alternately stricken and determined; perhaps in the end it would have been more fun for all concerned if she had played the wolf. A mysterious credit buried in the final scroll is one for ""assistant to Mr. von Sydow -- Catherine von Sydow"" even though there is no Mr. von Sydow visible in the picture.
