But Run All Night reminds you of a particular set of skills hes been deprioritizing namely his acting chops. A New York City-set chase film that in its better moments nears the sweet spot last occupied by 1993s The Fugitive it gives Neeson an actual character to play. He is Jimmy Conlon a washed-up mob hitman whose fearsome reputation has been marinating at the bottom of a Scotch glass. When Jimmys estranged adult son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) witnesses a brutal crime that quickly escalates into a self-defense killing both Conlons are targeted by Jimmys old boss Shawn (Ed Harris furiously good in a too-small part) unless they can somehow... eh just read the title again. Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra occasionally panics and sends his camera speeding high above the city like a drone on steroids as if his audience would fall asleep at the thought of watching a scene without any punching. But in the main hes making a character-driven drama about betrayed honor and the result is a film closer in spirit to the baggage-rich crime novels of Dennis Lehane than dumb multiplex fare. A dogged detective (Vincent DOnofrio) could have been better developed and after so much pungent location shooting in Brooklyn and Queens its a drag to end up skulking around some boring upstate woods for a climax. But when the movie is doing its tough-guy-seeking-redemption thing its more than just good.

Run All Night is a movie that feels like it could be yet another installment of Taken yet it doesnt disappoint from a pure entertainment perspective. Neeson plays a father chock full of flaws but ultimately mends his deteriorated relationship with his son who is wrongly wanted for crimes he didnt commit.

"Run All Night | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; run-all-night ) Run All Night (United States 2015) March 13 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Liam Neeson action thrillers come in two categories the straightforward variety that transform him into a superhuman force of nature and those that are grittier and a little more respectful of an adult audiences intelligence. Considering the way the winds blow at the box office there are understandably more of the former than the latter; at least Run All Night can be said to add one title to the more serious side of Neesons ledger. Theres plenty of action in director Jaume Collet-Serras third collaboration with the Irish actor (not to mention a high body count) but the subtext is about regret and the difficulty of redemption in the face of certain sins. The trailers make Run All Night look like a fast-paced shoot-em-up and although those elements are present this is a darker and grimmer experience. Jimmy Conlon (Neeson) is an ex-assassin nearing his expiration date. After having killed around 18 people while working for his friend crime boss Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) Jimmy has oozed into a retirement filled with drink and regrets. He lives alone in a hovel and never sees his only son Michael (Joel Kinnaman) until circumstances force a reunion. Coincidence makes Michael a witness to a brutal double-murder committed by Shawns son Danny (Boyd Holbrook). The boss calls to ask his old friend to act as a mediator but before a non-violent resolution can be reached Danny takes matters into his own hands. To save his son Jimmy has no choice but to shoot to kill and the result forces the two Conlons onto the run with Shawns mob of thugs and hired hit men nipping at their heels. To say the dynamic between father-and-son is strained is to understate the situation. Michael is overflowing with resentment and rage and as the night progresses it becomes apparent that he and Jimmy arent headed for a catharsis. There was a time when gangster films regularly romanticized the mob lifestyle but there has been a shift in recent years to looking through a darker lens. Jimmy is a damaged man who regrets almost everything in his life. He drinks to forget and goes home to an empty apartment. We learn that his abandonment of Michael was done out of love because he believed his continued presence in his sons life would lead to corruption. What Michael sees as neglect and rejection Jimmy sees as perhaps the only selfless thing he has ever done. This disparity forms the basis for a relationship that doesnt follow the usual ""broken father/son"" arc we normally encounter in films of this sort. The Jimmy/Shawn friendship is equally complex - two old buddies who have been through the wars together and whose shared history makes them closer than brothers but who cannot surmount the single tragedy that sets events in motion. Neesons Jimmy is similar to the character he played in his previous outing for Collet-Sera Non-Stop a once-tough guy whose skills have eroded as a result of a lengthy passionate affair with the bottle. Neesons inherent likability is an asset because it allows us to sympathize (at least to a degree) with a man who if viewed objectively represents the depths of human depravity and evil. Ed Harris adopting a weary low-key approach (think Michael Corleone in Godfather 3) is a good foil for Neeson. The Killings Joel Kinnaman avoids turning Michael into a character who exists solely to facilitate his fathers dubious quest for redemption. Rapper-turned-actor Common adds a traditional action/thriller flair to the mix as an expert hired killer tasked with eliminating Jimmy and Michael. The screenplay isnt airtight. The story hinges on an improbable coincidence but viewers who dont have a problem with that (Michael being the limo driver for the two drug dealers executed by Danny) wont blink at the smaller contrivances that crop up during the course of the narrative. One could question the decision to employ a wrap-around structure that steals away suspense. There are also times when Collet-Serra bends knee to staples of the genre such as Neeson in a lengthy physical fight where he takes the kind of pounding only a superhero could absorb. Those are relatively minor quibbles however. Run All Night is a taut edgy affair that features Neeson in peak action form and allows him to partially atone for the indignity of Taken 3.

Its the sort of film where a woman accidentally caught by the camera practically apologizes and scurries away from the lens. When two men sit in a car the windows inevitably fog.Weary killer Jimmy the Gravedigger is played by 62-year-old Liam Neeson Collet-Serras muse both men still enjoying the afterglow of 2008s Taken. That movie launched a new genre -- Geezer Guignol -- which clicked with audiences because it taps into several fantasies at once It makes old men feel cool and young men feel hopeful and allows snobbish cineastes to justify their zeal for gore by pointing at Neesons Oscar nomination. (Now even Sean Penn has muscled into the marketplace with The Gunman directed by Takens Pierre Morel.) Plus aging up the action star has the neat trick of giving even the silliest scripts gravitas. Our hero isnt some quippy kid but a bathed-in-blood King Lear. Look into Neesons eyes and know even if the dialogue cant quite express it that this man understands death.Once the guns are unholstered Neesons movies are always the same whether they take place on planes or Turkish rooftops. Neeson and Collet-Serra have made three of them. At least Brad Ingelsbys script for Run All Night opens with a twist. Neesons Jimmy is a pathetic drunk two decades past intimidating the thugs at the local pub the headquarters of New Yorks Irish mafia. Though he murdered more than a dozen men including his own cousin today hes mocked for passing out at the bar and farting in his sleep. (Do the young jokers not see his abs?) Forced to play Santa at a posh Christmas party Jimmy gets wasted on scotch upsets the children and propositions the wives who have the good sense to grimace when he boasts ""Im skinny but Im long.""Collet-Serra doesnt play the scene for laughs. Its pure humiliation. And the setup pays off when the host Shawn (Ed Harris) a rich crook attempting to go straight doesnt throw his old buddy out of his house. Instead he tucks Jimmy in an upstairs bedroom feeds him a sandwich and gets him talking about his broken soul. This says the movie is male friendship -- straight talk and forgiveness. With Jimmys wife long dead and his son (Joel Kinnaman) a young father and boxing coach estranged whatever decades the broke murderer has left are just pointless muck no more worthwhile than time spent watching a mud puddle dry.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Then Run All Night gets really cruel. Thanks to a too-coincidental collision between Jimmys son Michael Shawns son Danny (Boyd Holbrook) and a couple Albanian heroin dealers the two old lions are forced to hunt each other to defend their families. Collet-Serra is so excited to unleash Neeson that the film spins itself silly with swooping zooms and portentous lightning claps both of which make this movies New York seem as small and goofy as a comic-book panel. Theyre the directorial flourishes of a guy who wants to impress. But flagrant CGI doesnt quite fit a story as musty as this -- its the equivalent of a shoe salesman swaggering into a nightclub with a backwards cap.It all works for a while because Neeson has hooked us on his characters woes. We care about this defeated flatulent man even as we agree that his only value is as a human shield. In an early phone call Shawn warns Jimmy ""You know how this has to end."" He does and so do we. The only questions are whether hell be able to die on his own terms and if he deserves to. After all Jimmys still the creep who awkwardly jokes that he went to his wifes wake for the free booze.The flick is at its best when Collet-Serra goes old-school with clanging-metal car chases flaming-table-leg fights and a brawl set in the filthiest subway bathroom in Queens. (When Neesons flung against a urinal his gravest danger is hepatitis.) There are as many wall-mounted phones as Three Days of the Condor -- if youre counting there are more phones than female characters who spend the movie comatose in hospital beds fretting silently in the background or being hugged through a doorway. Its enough to make you wish a girl would get kidnapped just to factor in to the plot. But like the Bible Run All Night is devoted to its sons who grow up to be ingrates or losers but are framed like angels in the family portraits that cluster along every interior wall.Let us not question that guilt-ridden Jimmy is willing to protect his boy by er doubling his body count and murdering his old friends (though the film would be better if it did). As Shawn says we know how this story ends. Run All Night is like spending two hours looping around the same roller coaster -- theres no shame in giving in to the familiar thrills or in bypassing it entirely in search of new kinds of fun.Run All Night Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra Warner Bros.

"Overkill The Return of Liam Neeson and Cinderella << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Overkill The Return of Liam Neeson and Cinderella Warner Bros. Entertainment Movies March 13 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print In Run All Night Liam Neeson is Jimmy Conlon an alcoholic lout and assassin for the Irish mob of Queens New York. Jimmy has been pals with Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) long enough for the creases around their eyes to match. Until about five minutes ago Shawn was a biggish-time drug boss. But he has gone legit just in time to refuse a cocaine-distribution partnership that his son Danny (Boyd Holbrook) has promised to an Albanian outfit. Shawn has seen drugs destroy too many lives but he cant see that the track suits and the finger tattoos and the indoor sunglasses on the Albanians spell doom for Danny; he doesnt know that Danny also owes the Albanians money. When they arrive at his apartment to collect Dannys tweaking with some bros and decides to shoot his visitors including one he has to run down and slay on the street. He does this in full view of the Albanians limo driver and The Black Kid From The Projects whom the driver mentors at the local boxing gym. The kid just happens to be biking by in time to record the murder with his cameraphone. Danny recognizes the limo driver because naturally the limo driver is Jimmys son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) who years ago cut Jimmy out of his life because Jimmy is ""trash."" But later the Trash saves his sons life by shooting Danny dead and Jimmy and Mike wind up on the run together from Shawn and his gush of goons including Holt McCallany who continues his string of body man roles. With all due respect for Harriss ability to overact even while underacting and given the hour-plus of citywide demolition the stakes for the action here are awfully low. One dead crook is enough to spark one of those under-the-elevated-train car chases produce a pile of dead cops (upstanding corrupt etc.) and incite a manhunt that jeopardizes Mikes wife daughters and his poor put-upon brother-in-law. Theres a big shoot-em-up in a massive mostly black public housing complex where the Conlons are looking for the kid who shot the video. The NYPD evacuates the building and one of the evacuees fails to turn off her stove whereupon a grease fire turns into an explosion from Die Hard. Neeson brings his usual mix of cowboy dignity and dusty humor to a part whose bigotry and drunken dimness call for a much dumber performance. Killing is probably the only thing Jimmys good at but aside from one early scene in which he fails at playing Santa at Shawns Christmas party his incompetence is entirely anecdotal. Neeson is working with Jaume Collet-Serra the Spaniard who directed him in the similarly ludicrous but far better far more intense Non-Stop. Collet-Serra gives his star ample close-ups (and one rejuvenated flashback) and puts him at the center of a couple of well-done chases and fights one of which is set in a roomy subway bathroom complete with a cloth hand dryer ripe for weaponization. But Collet-Serra is out of inspiration. Youre waiting so long for the balls in Brad Ingelsbys script to land that the ""all night"" of the title becomes a promise. The action sequences get overly familiar. After the bathroom fight I thought Whats next a train-yard shootout? Yes indeed. The movie begins by rewinding 16 hours from the end which is one of the most torturous devices in all of action-thriller-dom Its been 90 minutes and were not even close to wherever it is this movie starts Toward the end Mike tells Jimmy to run and Jimmy says hes too old. Hes been running for half a day and Neesons been going for like eight movies and now hes too old? Sometimes it doesnt take much to make one of these overblown gangster-crime thrillers tolerable. Something witty falls out of a detectives mouth. One of the bosses (or one of his lackeys) is played by a charismatic weirdo -- or a star. Theres a plot that you want to follow instead of a plot thats dragging you feet first toward the closing credits. The cinematographer knows how to compose a shot. Theres an action sequence that makes you want to stand up and cheer. Or maybe the movie is short. Any one of those things can be enough to keep you in your seat. Run All Night has something like that. When Common shows up just past the halfway point wearing a perfectly tailored mackintosh and thick glasses and carrying a gun a laser pointer and night-vision toys you sit up. He has about three scenes and says maybe two sentences but he makes them count. I dont know if hes any kind of actor. But when hes in a limp romantic comedy or a shitty action movie he changes its properties. Hes the one thing in Run All Night that you dont feel like youve seen before even if the part is just like the nut job Brian F. OByrne played in The International. But I was bored anyway and when youre bored with something like Run All Night theres plenty of time to notice the sadomasochistic romance with crime and the premium it places on white crooks. (The same goes for the blind affection lavished on the hip-hop gangstas in Neill Blomkamps Chappie.) Jimmy is a rueful cold-blooded hit man. But hes also the hero of a Hollywood movie. By now were so used to seeing Neeson killing for the worthy cause of protecting his family that this movie can bust reason and break the normal bounds of morality for him to do it once again. The detective whos been on Jimmys case for years played by Vincent DOnofrio is still bitter about his crimes. So is Mike. So is Jimmys brother (played by a fine famous actor who here is as gratuitous as that train-yard scene). Its true that Jimmy is riddled with guilt. ""Just because Im not behind bars"" he says to Mike ""doesnt mean Im not paying for what I did."" But it does mean that Neeson enjoys the luxury of our paying to see him do it.  Walt Disney Co. The makers of Disneys1 new live-action Cinderella probably mean well. Theyve tricked out the movie in visual effects that let the pumpkin erupt into a gilt carriage - less ""poof"" more ka-blam. Theyve given it a sound design that could credibly be mistaken for American Snipers and costumes that NASA would send a probe to study. But the filmmakers are still stuck with this English rejiggering of Charles Perraults 318-year-old version of the folk tale which the average American kid learns through osmosis. You know the story. A mistreated maid wins a magical evening at the royal ball but has to make an abrupt exit before the spell expires. Smitten the prince retrieves the glass shoe she leaves behind and tracks her down. That is that. That here is 112 minutes a full half-hour longer than the 1950 animated original which was also a musical and a true visual enchantment. Theres one production number for the 2015 version -- the dance at the ball -- and scarcely any singing. Cinderella (Lily James) warbles here and there but the score (more noise it must be said) hits her like a tsunami. The film explains how Cinderella -- calling herself Ella -- goes from aristocratic heiress to glorified maid. Her widowed colonialist father (Ben Chaplin) remarries a widow (Cate Blanchett) with two bratty daughters (Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera) and they take over the mansion after he dies abroad. As the stepmother Blanchett demonstrates a commendable lack of shame. Like Glenn Close in those Dalmatian movies she makes evil glamorous. Twisting her lines as though shes wringing a neck and cocking her head and gliding across a room as though reared in a classical Hollywood finishing school shes fun. But shes the latest elite actress to go full hag for a bombastic fairy tale. If acting is comparable to fashion Agnes Moorehead is the new Bette Davis. Or maybe Faye Dunaway never goes out of style. (Helena Bonham Carter shows up as the blonde bumbling fairy godmother and despite the cheery circumstances she gives the part a psychotic twitch. Her wand might as well be a hammer.) Kenneth Branagh directed this movie. I didnt know that until the closing credits but it explains the scenes between the prince (Richard Madden) and his father whos played by Derek Jacobi. Jacobi has worked with Branagh onstage and in Branaghs other movies. These scenes are as dull as the rest of the film is loud but a frisson of love comes through them. They also impart a sense of the dramatic complexity of Branaghs early Shakespeare adaptations and his great reincarnation thriller Dead Again. I dont know why these palace scenes are here except as a warm respite from the arch comedy over at Cinderellas. They do however establish that boys in these fairy tales also have standards -- along with bulging riding pants. Disney has attached an animated Frozen short to the front of this movie. Its cruel like starting a long overcooked dinner with dessert. The Frozen world is new to us underexploited. Its got an energy and personality that Branagh tries to give to Cinderella but Branaghs is excessive. Cinderella is caught halfway between the stateliness of a PBS period piece and the nonsense of Branaghs Thor. Including the short was meant to give the kids in the audience two treats. Im all for confection but this movie takes that too far. Cinderella and the prince look like they belong on a wedding cake. Grantland is a Walt Disney Company property.

Neesons latest old-guy stunt-spectacular Run All Night is typical of Neesons recent output an admirable cat-and-mouse tale that puts forth a lot of cliches and executes them with B-movie intensity. Neeson plays Jimmy Conlon an assassin for an Irish gang run by Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris). Jimmy is broke drunk and alienated from his son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) who works as a limo driver. Mike witnesses the execution of a pair of gangsters by Maguires son Danny (Boyd Holbrook) setting in motion a series of events that leads to Dannys death and a 12-hour hunt of Jimmy and Mike by both Maguires thugs and the police led by Jimmys longtime nemesis Detective Harding (Vincent DOnofrio). The first act of Run All Night cruises at a pulpy pace and engages in a very disorienting series of transitions that feels like a Google Maps plug-in but once the gears are set in motion the action beats are spot-on A high-speed chase down Jamaica Avenue in Queens a slam-bang escape from a raid on an apartment building and plenty of Neesons signature close-quarters kung fu. Throw in a visit from a Terminator-esque gun-for-hire (played with psychotic glee by Common) and youve got a bracing fun hour of cinema. Unfortunately Run All Night gets a little slack with its third act and runs out of steam by the time the final showdown arrives. Director Jaume Collet-Serra who also pointed a camera at Neeson for the dreary Unknown and last years Taken-on-a-plane hit Non-Stop has a hard time tying his films together and Run All Night suffers from erratic pacing. Still Neeson brings his signature gravity to his role and his scenes with Harris--particularly a seems-like-old-times tete-a-tete late in the film--are intense and arresting. Kinnaman fares less well--he broods with the best of them but he tends to disappear opposite the charismatic Neeson. Ultimately Run All Night doesnt go far enough in any particular direction to make it stand out among Neesons late-career best Its not as brazenly loopy as the Taken series nor is it as tactile and gritty as last years criminally underseen but excellent A Walk Among the Tombstones. Watching the 62-year-old Neeson plow through thick-necked cannon fodder will always be entertaining but its the down time between ass-kickings that sets his transcendent late-period work apart.

Movie after movie its the same thing - hes some once-formidable man whos either retired or is about to who likes the drink a little too much and maybe mourns a loss who just wants to be left alone. So give the fellow a wide berth why dont you? But no someone always has to come along and poke him with a sharp stick. And like that big sleeping dog they really should let lie but dont he slowly gets to his feet and comes after them. And keeps coming. ""Run All Night"" is the latest and frankly it blurs a little into the rest of the Lethal Liam movies. Partly thats because there have been so many of them lately (two ""Unknown"" and ""Non-Stop"" from this director) and partly because its set in the same angry mostly Irish New York as Neesons recent ""A Walk Among the Tombstones."" But this isnt a bad thing. ""Tombstones"" was one of his better actioners actually. And director Jaume Collet-Sera (and screenwriter Brad Ingelsby who did the slightly pretentious ""Out of the Furnace"") have teamed up to give this story a good cast and at least one strong pair of conflicting characters. Thats hard man Jimmy Conlon played by Neeson and mob boss Shawn Maguire played by Ed Harris. Conlon used to be Maguires muscle; now hes gone to seed and Scotch. But then (as it almost always does in these Neeson movies) a family obligation arises and a threat. And the two old brothers-in-arms now become mortal enemies with Neeson forced to protect his son and Harris vowing to kill them both. Much of this is pure pulp. The plot hinges on a huge coincidence and Jimmys required to go from shaky alcoholic back to ace assassin in a matter of hours. Theres also a Javert-style cop whos been trying to arrest him for a quarter of a century. But these veteran stars are also two fine actors and when they meet for one of their several scenes - Neeson in hawklike profile Harris in ravaged closeup - their faces provide the poetry the dialogue sometimes lacks and lift the movie above its Irish-gangster roots. They set a standard in fact that the rest of the over-eager movie cant quite reach. Collet-Sera sends his camera hurtling around on computer-assisted journeys like a mad pinball; a late-in-the-movie assassin played by Common comes off like a Bond villain. Nor are the other actors much help. Joel Kinnaman plays Neesons estranged adult son but with his shaved head and embittered scowl he has all the appeal of a knuckle; guest star Nick Noltes one scene is so arbitrary (and he himself looks like such a skid-row Santa) that the audience I saw it with had a fit of the giggles. But then every so often the film gets back to Harris and Neeson as two tough Queens kids grown old their best-friendship soured Neesons hero-worship curdled. They have one scene together in a bar for example and true its underwritten and arbitrary (like the Pacino/DeNiro coffeeshop meet-up in ""Heat"" it feels inserted just to bring two great performers together). But when Harris looks into the camera it doesnt matter what hes doing and when Neesons soft voice slides around a word it doesnt matter what hes saying. The feeling is there. The movie hits all the necessary B-movie beats. Theres the requisite scene where Neeson takes out a roomful of men without batting an eyelash; the preordained climax when one last stand must be made and old wounds finally healed. Its not a great movie - although it is a rough sketch for one and it made me think of what James Gray who has a real feel for New York tribalism could have done with this (and what ""State of Grace"" the Westies movie that Harris starred in more than 25 years ago already did). But mostly thanks to its stars it is a perfectly acceptable if unnecessary addition to the angry middle-aged guy action-movie genre. And further proof - as if we needed any - that the best thing to do if you ever see Liam Neeson scowling in a bar is to give him a nod and keep walking. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence drug and alcohol abuse and strong language. Run All Night (R) Warner Bros. (114 min.) Directed by Jaume Collet-Sera.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan March 12 2015 Liam Neesons character in ""Run All Night"" makes Bryan Mills the actors trigger-happy CIA operative in three ""Taken"" films look like Oskar Schindler. When we first meet Jimmy Conlon the sloppy-drunk former hit man is flat broke dressed in a Santa suit that reeks of liquor and making vulgar comments about a colleagues wife. Having murdered 16 or more people -- including a relative -- Jimmy carries around a burden of guilt that has crushed him into the shape of something hateful. Nicknamed the ""Gravedigger"" Neesons antihero is hard to like let alone recognize as human even with the reservoir of goodwill that the actors fans naturally bring with them to his films more and more of which feature some version of this damaged soul. Is it any wonder that Jimmys grown son Michael (Joel Kinnaman) hasnt spoken to his father in five years? Just about the only one left with any feeling for Jimmy is Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) the mob boss for whom Jimmy once worked and whose affection for his former triggerman seems closer to pity. But even that pity dries up when Jimmy kills Shawns son Danny (Boyd Holbrook) an unpleasant cokehead who was about to shoot Michael. Shawn vows vengeance on his former employee mustering his army of goons -- and a coolly methodical hit man robotically played by the rapper Common -- to kill Michael as son-for-a-son payback. In a bid for the kind of phony redemption that movies of this ilk typically traffic in Jimmy resolves to save Michael at all costs. The film by Jaume Collet-Serra who previously directed Neeson in ""Unknown"" and ""Non-Stop"" plays out with the stylish if numbingly schematic brutality of an artsy action flick. Despite some cool camera work and the kind of noir-lite moral ambiguity that barely gets your shoes dirty (courtesy of a shallow script by Brad ""Out of the Furnace"" Ingelsby) the movie is the cinematic equivalent of junk food. It satisfies the craving for the sensation of nihilism without its substance. A typical line of Jimmys ""Just because Im not behind bars doesnt mean Im not paying for what I did."" Oh really? And exactly how is Jimmy paying for it? By killing more people apparently. After sobering up quickly enough to strain even the most generous credulity Jimmy embarks on a one-night mission to protect his son dispatching Shawns henchman and a bunch of cops (who were presumably crooked anyway) with impunity. Whenever Michael himself picks up a weapon in self-defense Jimmy makes sure to disarm him. And just why is that? What gradually becomes clear in a portrait of loathsomeness that is less dramatic than depressing is that Jimmy isnt protecting Michael from Shawn so much as he is protecting him from turning into Jimmy.

"Run All Night review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Run All Night Run All Night Warner Bros. Liam Neeson in ""Run All Night."" Liam Neeson in ""Run All Night."" (Warner Bros.) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Liam Neeson Ed Harris Vincent DOnofrio--""Run All Night"" does lack for actors with world-we In a convention-bound action movie such as ""Run All Night"" some nicely rumpled actors can go a long way toward redeeming the cliches the primary cliche being a flawed protagonist who seeks redemption for his sins.Well This is like an honor roll of the rumpled beginning with Liam Neeson our supreme late-winter action star. The film co-stars Ed Harris very well-rumpled and like Neeson deeply creased around the eyes in interesting ways. Vincent DOnofrio rumples his way through the role of an NYPD detective trying to get Neesons character a guilt-stricken mobbed-up hit man to confess to his crimes before the Harris character eliminates him from the living. ""Run All Night"" also makes room for a Nick Nolte cameo and even Noltes voice is rumpled. Joel Kinnaman as Neesons bitter and increasingly desperate son may be the second-most-important character in the film but I dont remember much about him except that he was less rumpled. Directed frantically by Jaume Collet-Serra written by Brad Ingelsby ""Run All Night"" promises a sprint punctuated by a lot of gunfire and bleeding and bodies. Mission accomplished. The story unfolds as a 16-hour flashback. Jimmy Conlon (Neeson) is estranged from his limo driver son Mike (Kinnaman). The movie explains why we first see Jimmy on the ground near a cabin in the woods bleeding narrating in voice-over like a fiend with a deadline.The twitchy greedy son (Boyd Holbrook) of mob boss Shawn Maguire (Harris) has been murdered and though Jimmy pulled the trigger Shawn wants Mike dead in trade. A steely hired killer (Common) is on Shawns payroll as well. ""Run All Night"" strikes some intriguing notes of melancholic nostalgia with childhood friends Shawn and Jimmy remembering what New York and Hells Kitchen were like in the old days. Some of the action is staged crisply and well; the bulk of it alas is paced and chopped by director Collet-Serra and editor Dirk Westervelt at an unvarying hyper rhythm. The directors previous Neeson vehicles ""Unknown"" and ""Non-Stop"" didnt exactly sit around but even with their chaos and contrivances I got a little more out of those pictures than this one. Talented but frustrating Collet-Serra comes up with some impressive staging; one of the few sustained camera movements establishes the nighttime rail yard where Jimmy and Shawn have their ""Heat""-style showdown and the way the actors dart in and out of the frame is very satisfying. Much of the rest of ""Run All Night"" is pure brutality and a visual blur.On the other hand Its better than some of the dreck floating our way lately and the actors compensate. ""Run All Night"" hands Neeson some copacetic co-stars with lots of mileage among them. And for the record the script uses ruthless Albanian drug lords as secondary adversaries. Call it the ""Taken"" rule. If Neeson ever makes a sequel to ""The Grey"" even the wolves will be Albanian.

Liam Neeson and Common in ""Run All Night"" Critic would see it voluntarily. Photo Myles Aronowitz / Associated Press Run All Night -- another strong Neeson action thriller 1 / 4 Back to Gallery This is probably sad but somehow it doesnt feel sad The most consistently satisfying thing in the American cinema right now is the Liam Neeson action movie. With ""Taken"" released in January 2009 the right formula met the right actor and ever since it has been a delight watching Neeson play downtrodden fundamentally decent men who realize themselves by becoming homicidal maniacs. Now we have ""Run All Night"" directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who has previously directed two of the better Neeson thrillers ""Unknown"" (2012) and ""Non-Stop"" (2014). Collet-Serra understands the essential truth of these Neeson films that they are thinly disguised rags-to-riches tales in which a worthy person starts off low and ends up high. The lower he starts off the better. In ""Taken"" Neeson began as a former CIA agent emasculated by domesticity. In ""Non-Stop"" he was an alcoholic air marshal boozing it up before a trans-Atlantic flight. In ""Run All Night"" hes really a mess a drunken conscience-ridden former hit man reduced to begging for handouts from his friend and former boss (Ed Harris). How bad does it get? In an early scene he has to tank up on booze in order to play Santa Claus at the boss Christmas party. The kids complain that he smells bad and he makes lewd remarks to the wives. Clearly this is a man without hope. He may have a particular set of skills but theyre not in demand ... until they are. Jimmy (Neeson) also has a grown son Michael who hates him (of course) but that doesnt stop Jimmy from saving his life. On the big night Jimmy kills the man who is about to kill Michael. Unfortunately the dead man is the son of the mob boss which means that Jimmy and Michael have to ... run all night. The sheer perversity of Neesons thrillers is a big part of their delight. ""Taken"" for example was all about a father who gains the love of his teenage daughter by shooting choking stabbing and electrocuting scores of people. (Then in ""Taken 2"" he bonded with the daughter by teaching her to throw hand grenades.) In ""Run All Night"" Neeson is redeemed as a family man by going on a shooting spree. This is sick but its a variety of sick that is strangely appealing. The closest precedent for Neesons thrillers is the ""Death Wish"" series of the 1970s with Charles Bronson as a mild-mannered man who becomes a vigilante. But Bronsons rampages were random and done out of hate while Neeson is always motivated by love. This makes his films more twisted while paradoxically making Neeson more lovable and cuddly. In fact in ""Run All Night"" Neeson is so loving he doesnt just love his son. He also loves the mob boss whos trying to kill his son. Watching the film you can see that Collet-Serra worked with his actors Neeson and Ed Harris to make that relationship feel lived in and full of unspoken affection and a shared past. Every time they get together they tell stories about the old days and for once the stories sound like real stories about things that might actually have been enjoyable. Sometimes two old buddies have nothing in common but the past but if theyre each others link to some lost cherished part of themselves that can be enough. After devising a sturdy frame for Neesons special brand of sorrowful mayhem the filmmakers expertly fill in ""Run All Night"" with a series of charged action scenes including a rare one in which Neeson chases after a cop car instead of the other way around. The stakes are high and the odds arent good. Hes such a decent person and hes clearly the underdog. Hes just doing what anybody would do under the circumstances. Yes even when youre smirking Neeson makes you care. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com. Twitter MickLaSalle Run All Night Action.

"Review In fast-paced Run All Night Liam Neeson and Ed Harris shine - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review In fast-paced Run All Night Liam Neeson and Ed Harris shine Run All Night Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Run All Night Starring Liam Neeson and Ed Harris. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Run All Night Starring Liam Neeson and Ed Harris. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter .KennethTuran finds much to like in Run All Night particularly Liam Neeson and Ed Harris acting ""Run All Night"" is genre to the core a violent action thriller about a critical 16 hours in the lives of some very bad people but that doesnt mean there arent any number of good things in it.Top of that list are Liam Neeson and Ed Harris under the same cinematic roof for the first time playing old friends and New York gangland comrades whose relationship gets turned upside down during those turbulent hours. Both men have done action before (the ""Taken"" films have turned Neeson into a lucrative action franchise all by himself) but the opportunity to play off each other has raised their game. The dramatic scenes these two share reflect the commitment of dedicated actors capable of bringing out the emotion in any kind of film. Especially good is Harris who cared enough about the part to take it on despite simultaneously doing eight shows a week in the Broadway production of a Beth Henley play.That kind of connection wouldnt happen without the gritty dialogue of screenwriter Brad Ingelsby whose script includes such dead-on pulp lines as ""I had to kill people I loved theres not enough money to pull me back into that"" and ""Its a hell of a thing to know youre never going to make the woman you love happy again."" But though ""Run All Night"" turns out to be a tale of fathers and sons as well as a story of conflict between friends this is obviously not a straight drama. Its a crime story filled with shootouts and sudden death and as such it relies heavily on coincidence and contrivance. If you cant roll with those kinds of convoluted plot punches youre not going to be happy. By Noelene Clark and Patrick Kevin Day Its not only the strength of the acting that pulls us over bumps in the narrative its the crisp streamlined direction of Spanish filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra who also directed Neeson in the improbable ""Non-Stop."" The new film is not especially plausible either but its hard to find the breathing room to care as lightning-fast editing by Dirk Westervelt compels attention.Ingelsby initially envisioned the story in Philadelphia but it was moved to New York City particularly the outer boroughs and Collet-Serra clearly was energized by the pace of the metropolis.Working with cinematographer Martin Ruhe and production designer Sharon Seymour he gives a more convincing sense of the outer boroughs than fellow European director Michael Roskam did in ""The Drop."" Collet-Serra was especially attracted to the citys bustling elevated trains and uses their disruptive noise to keep audiences off-balance. Cinderella expected to bring magic to box office Saba Hamedy Disneys live-action version of ""Cinderella"" will likely enchant audiences this weekend. The film which brings back the classic animated fairytale could premiere to as much as 65 million according to people familiar with pre-release audience surveys. That puts it on top of the box office charts... Disneys live-action version of ""Cinderella"" will likely enchant audiences this weekend. The film which brings back the classic animated fairytale could premiere to as much as 65 million according to people familiar with pre-release audience surveys. That puts it on top of the box office charts... (Saba Hamedy) ""Run All Night"" opens with a classic framing device with Neesons Jimmy Conlon flat on his back reflecting on his misspent past. ""Ive done terrible things in my life things for which I cannot be forgiven"" he says adding what a glance at his tormented face makes clear ""No sin goes unpunished.""The film then flashes back precisely 16 hours where we discover that this once-feared gangland assassin nicknamed ""Jimmy the Gravedigger"" is a bedraggled alcoholic taunted by Det. John Harding (Vincent DOnofrio) the tough cop whos spent decades trying to bring him to justice.Most humiliating of all for Jimmy is that he has to ask for handouts from Danny Maguire (Boyd Holbrook) the nasty wastrel son of his old pal and still mob boss Shawn Maguire (Harris) the only man in all five boroughs who cares if Jimmy lives or dies.Jimmy it soon develops has a grown son of his own though he hasnt seen him in years. That would be Mike Conlon convincingly played by Joel Kinnaman of Swedens ""Snabba Cash"" and the TV series ""The Killing."" Married to the feisty Gabriela (Genesis Rodriguez) and the father of two daughters he is a good enough guy to mentor a local kid (Aubrey Omari Joseph) in boxing but he also burns with an all-consuming fury at the amoral dad who ruined his life.Unfortunately for Mike in the blink of an eye a series of events too complicated to relate has him on the run with half of New York trying their best to kill him including an emotionless stone-cold professional killer played by Common (last seen accepting an Oscar for cowriting the inspirational theme ""Glory"" from ""Selma"").And wouldnt you know it the only person who has a prayer of keeping Mike alive the only man to possess the required set of acute murderous skills (albeit theoretically dulled by years of hitting the bottle) is none other than his hated father Jimmy. What a coincidence.Though one would like to think there are better ways to reconnect with estranged offspring than to strafe everyone in sight Collet-Serra and his team expert at staging everything from car chases to close quarter combat may yet change your mind. Rife with familiar elements given something of a different spin ""Run All Night"" manages to leave you out of breath but hungry for more.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Liam Neeson The Killing (tv program) ""Run All Night"" Liam Neeson can terrify you with a childrens story Cinderella expected to bring magic to box office Liam Neeson John Slattery take Ted 2 roles Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-run-all-night-review-20150313-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,runallnight12,runallnight,latimes

Weve seen it all before but hes good at it and director Jaume Collet-Serra brings a stylish touch to the film.Former hit man Jimmy Conlon (Liam Neeson) and his estranged son (Joel Kinnaman) fight to survive mobsters and cops in ""Run All Night.""(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Story Highlights3 stars (out of 5)Neeson goes back to the killing-machine well again with better results than other times.Collet-Serra brings a stylish approach to the direction.How much you like ""Ride All Night"" will depend on how much you enjoy watching Liam Neeson run around putting holes in people.Judging by his unlikely late-career resurgence as a killing machine in the ""Taken"" franchise and a string of other movies a lot of people enjoy that very much.So here we go again.Here Neeson plays Jimmy Conlon. Can a character with that name in a movie be anything but a hit man? Not in this movie he cant. Actually Jimmy is retired a man haunted by the grisly things he has done. These acts have also driven him from his son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) who has a life of his own as a limo driver. Mike keeps his wife and children as far from Jimmy as he can.Its not a bad idea. These days Jimmy is mostly a drunk doing things like embarrassing himself as a pitiful Santa Claus at a party at the home of his old boss and lifelong friend Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris). Shawn has tried to go legitimate with his businesses though his short-tempered coke-fiend son Danny (Boyd Holbrook) seemingly didnt get the memo.Dannys idiocy disrupts the lives of all the characters which is to say that he makes an unwise decision that sets up the rest of the film to play out as a series of scenes of men shooting at each other all night long.Truly the story is the cinematic version of one of those carnival games where targets move past on a conveyer belt while you shoot at them only here the targets occasionally pause for a little macho threatening and exposition.But the thing is Neeson and Harris are good at this sort of thing. The outcome is never in doubt but an amazing amount of firepower is employed to get there.And yes once again the story such as it is involves the family of Neesons character. Kinnaman actually is good as the bitter son. And director Jaume Collet-Serra who teamed with Neeson for ""Unknown"" and ""Non-Stop"" is visually stylish. No one is going to mistake this for an art film but its look elevates it somewhat above the ""Taken"" series for instance. That kind of thing is appreciated for the segment of the audience who would like to see a little more than blood splattering all over the screen.Some talented actors show up in small roles. Bruce McGill plays Shawns right-hand man; Vincent DOnofrio plays a cop who has been trying to bust Jimmy for years. Common plays a professional hit man whose talents rival Jimmys (and whose technology surpasses Jimmys low-tech approach). But they pass by in blips.What are we to make of Neeson? He broods well and shoots better so its not surprising he has found a lucrative boost to his career playing these sorts of characters. You wonder Does he want more? Do these roles satisfy whatever acting itch got him into the business in the first place?Thats all up to him not us. We -- the audience -- can simply take what he gives us. Or not. In ""Drive All Night"" Neeson gives us more of the same although with Collet-Serras assistance its dressed up in a more interesting package.Run All Night3 stars (out of 5)Director Jaume Collet-Serra.Cast Liam Neeson Ed Harris Joel Kinnaman.Rating R for strong violence language including sexual references and some drug use.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(Myles Aronowitz) A movie review of ""Run All Night"" Liam Neeson gives his usual effective performance as a broken-down hit man trying to protect his grown son from an endless array of killers. Star rating 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times Liam Neeson is in a rut. A comfortable rut to be sure. For him anyway. The 20 million payday he reportedly received for ""Taken 3"" ensures that rut must be very well upholstered indeed. Hes become the most credible of aging action stars bringing superior acting chops and natural-born gravitas to his roles. But lately his pictures all seem like the same old same old. Time and again its him against a world of gnarly characters who want him dead who themselves invariably wind up deceased thanks to his particular set of lethal skills. So it is with ""Run All Night"" which is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who previously directed Neeson in ""Unknown"" and ""Non-Stop."" Movie Review    Run All Night with Liam Neeson Ed Harris Joel Kinnaman Common. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra from a screenplay by Brad Ingelsby. 108 minutes. Rated R for strong violence language including sexual references and some drug use. Several theaters. This time hes playing a broken-down Irish mafia hit man named Jimmy Conlon who gets sideways with his gangster boss and longtime best buddy Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) when he kills Shawns mad-dog son (Boyd Holbrook) who was just about to kill Jimmys own son (Joel Kinnaman all scowls).

Jimmy does and so do we with bullet-perforated corpses from dusk to dawn as Jimmy tries to protect his lad from Shawns vengeance. For a shaky old wreck Jimmy sure proves to be a durable cuss running with his son all night long (see title) through New York City not only from Shawns trigger men but from the enraged NYPD (they believe Jimmy is a cop killer) and also from a contract assassin played by Common. What we have here folks is killer overkill. Nothing that Jimmy cant handle. Except ... well the movie does open with him lying apparently dying on a forest floor intoning in voice-over his regrets about a life misspent. All the rest is told in flashback. So the tone set from the get-go is gloomy. His son despises Jimmy for having been an absent dad everyone else is out to get him. Downer city. Though Neeson as usual gives an effective performance maybe its time for him to lighten up and climb out of his rut. ""Run All Night"" feels like hes run into a career dead end.

Photo Credit AP / Myles Aronowitz advertisement | advertise on newsday Two blue-eyed old lions come face-to-face in ""Run All Night"" starring Liam Neeson and Ed Harris as Irish mobsters locked in a fight to the death. Neesons washed-up hit man Jimmy Conlon has killed the wayward son of Harris kingpin Shawn Maguire who cannot let that stand. Faster than you can sing ""Danny Boy"" the bodies start piling up as Jimmy struggles to protect his own son. Watching old friends turn murderous is always fun and ""Run All Night"" makes the most of this sudsy setup sandwiching gunplay and fistfights between thick slices of masculine pathos. (The script is by Brad Inglesby of the similarly overwrought ""Out of the Furnace."") This movie may not pack the genuine emotional punch of Michael Manns ""Heat"" or James Mangolds ""Cop Land"" -- or for that matter any of the countless Westerns that inspired it -- but ""Run All Night"" is a mostly satisfying action-drama from director Jaume Collet-Serra who made Neesons ""Non-Stop"" such a guilty pleasure. advertisement | advertise on newsday By now surely few viewers care that Neesons New York accent comes from old ""Bowery Boys"" movies or that at 62 hes looking a little less limber. Neeson still has physical presence and gravitas and we never doubt that his Jimmy can beat the brains out of a man half his age. Harris too gives good snarl and the two actors are at their best when they simply glower at each over a drink in their favorite restaurant. Joel Kinnaman an intriguing Swedish actor (2014s ""RoboCop"") plays Jimmys estranged son Michael a hardworking family man who gets dragged into Jimmys rotten world. Michael isnt much more than a McGuffin but the father-son tension helps keep things interesting. Less effective is Common as Price a high-tech assassin who eschews facial expressions. Rounding out the cast are Nick Nolte as Jimmys brother and Vincent DOnofrio as -- what else? -- a police detective. In this movie whenever two men take a stroll down memory lane one usually ends up killing the other. And because women dont understand the beautiful sorrow of it all they havent been cast in any important roles. If you like your testosterone matured and well-done however ""Run All Night"" will be just the ticket. 232 MoviesRun All Night trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Director Jaume Collet-Serra (155). R Language violence. Area theaters. Liam Neeson warns us what were in for from the first voiceover at the start of ""Run All Night"" ""Ive done terrible things in my life."" If hes talking about his choices as an actor its certainly true. But although this new action-drama isnt nearly as bad as ""Taken 2"" ""Taken 3"" or ""The A-team"" it does remain in the lower tier of Neesons save em-or-die flicks. Here Neeson plays Jimmy Conlon a down-on-his-luck former hit man known as ""The Gravedigger"" whose estranged thirtyish son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) winds up framed for a pair of killings committed by the bad-boy son of Jimmys former gangster boss (Ed Harris). In one night Jimmy sets out to clear his sons name chased by the NYPD detective (Vincent DOnofrio) who hunted him decades ago. As the Conlons crisscross the boroughs to avoid cops and thugs a mild-mannered but fierce enforcer (Common) comes in to take Jimmy and Mike down. There are so many characters racing through the hyperactively edited ""Run All Night"" that it feels like a thriller made in the midst of the New York marathon. Like last years ""The Drop"" theres a Byzantine network of lowlifes and bosses with Boyd Holbrook playing the bad-seed son standing out. Harris and DOnofrio add some grit and Nick Nolte shows up to bark out some back story. Its hard to see them through the grimy cinematography though. Liam Neeson has a perilous journey through New York in ""Run All Night."" (Myles Aronowitz) Ed Harris and Liam Neeson hold a sit-down in ""Run All Night."" (Myles Aronowitz) Liam Neeson and Joel Kinnaman in ""Run All Night."" (Myles Aronowitz) Liam Neeson takes aim in ""Run All Night."" (Myles Aronowitz) For the elder badass statesman Neeson there is very little to distinguish Jimmy from Matt in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" Bryan in the ""Taken"" films and Bill in ""Non-Stop"" except his omnipresent green Army jacket. Fatigue is all we get from ""Run All Night"" which hits us with such other dialogue doozies as ""Im the best chance youve got to stay alive"" ""You gotta trust me"" and ""He wont stop until were all dead"" Its like a greatest hits of Neesons action-movie quotes -- and they run all night.

Myles Aronowitz ""Run All Night""  One star  After his son is killed in a deal gone wrong a gangster (Ed Harris) blames his childhood friend (Liam Neeson).

Pictures Joel Kinnaman and Liam Neeson left appear in a scene from ""Run All Night."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Myles Aronowitz) Like the aging executioner he plays in ""Run All Night"" Liam Neeson once had a particular set of skills. And like the vintage muscle car that such characters are contractually obliged to drive Jimmy Conlon coughs up a lot of toxic fumes but barely merits a shrug from cynical New Yorkers.If Neeson has a shred of professional dignity left his prolonged skid into the action-movie morass will end here with a sympathetic hug from fellow graybeards Ed Harris and Nick Nolte. Harris plays gangster-gone-legit Shawn Maguire who has kept Conlon on the payroll out of neighborhood loyalty. On Maguires behalf Conlon killed too many people to count -- honest homicide Detective Harding (Vincent DOnofrio) pegs the number at 16 -- but now Conlon is too drunk to do much of anything. That includes making amends with his estranged son Michael (Joel Kinnaman) a young father who has traded boxing for a steady job as a limo driver.One night Michael blunders into a job driving some Albanian drug dealers to a shadowy meeting with Shawns own estranged son Danny (Boyd Holbrook). By the time the smoke clears at least 20 shots are fired and four men are dead (including two crooked cops) yet the only person in the five boroughs who seems to sense trouble is old Jimmy who rushes to his sons aide -- but leaves Shawns son drowning in a puddle of blood. At a ridiculously civil sit-down with his old friend Jimmy takes full responsibility and begs the big-shot to spare Michael. But no snarls Shawn my son will be avenged by daybreak and everything youve ever loved will be destroyed.(Jimmys loved ones include Nolte as his brother who looks so much like a garden gnome you wont recognize him.) The stakes dont seem nearly so Shakespearean in practice. Not a single one of these characters has a back story or a spiritual burden that we care about. Language-hampered Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra (""Unknown"") doesnt seem to understand that the script by Brad Inglesby (co-writer of ""Out of the Furnace"") is utterly anonymous crap. If youre a fan of the ""Taken"" movies and tend to give action-hero Neeson the benefit of the doubt our advice here is simple Run awayWhat ""Run All Night""  One star out of four  Rating R  Run time 154  Content Strong violence language including sexual references and some drug use Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Liam Neeson Ed Harris Joe Williams Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Common foreground and Liam Neeson tussle in ""Run All Night.""(Photo Myles Aronowitz AP)Under all his action-star antics Liam Neeson is a good actor.So his insistence on repeatedly playing a variation of the same role is mystifying. In the conventional thriller Run All Night he plays a guy hell-bent on protecting his son ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).Hes essentially the guy in Taken fallen on harder times. His Jimmy Conlon is a hired gun with killer aim and an angry estranged son Mike (Joel Kinnaman).Jimmy says things like ""Listen to your father for one night"" and ""Im the best chance youve got.""But these movies cant possibly be the best chance Neeson has got. Certainly hes offered more nuanced dramas that call on subtler acting skills and dont entail a mounting body count. The Irish actor reteams with his Non-Stop director Jaume Collet-Serra in a role not all that different from the drunken wreck he played in that airborne thriller. At a climactic moment a heartbreaking look comes over his face and the audience is reminded that Neeson is an actor of depth and expressiveness. However he doesnt seem to want to go there much of late.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare When his estranged son becomes a mob target an aging hit man must figure out where his loyalties lie and how to save his offspring from a deadly fate. VPCPerhaps hes thinking hell ride the action-star train as long as he can. Hes in top shape for a man of 62.But no matter how strapping he is its hard to believe any one person can fend off so many assailants especially those one-third his age.One of the better aspects of this predictable intermittently stylish film is the fraught relationship between father and son. Mike a dad himself not only resents his fathers choice of jobs but his overall absence from his life.It turns out that Neesons character kept his distance mainly to ensure the safety of his wife and son. Jimmy works for Mob boss Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris). He has a trigger-happy son Danny (Robert Boyd Holbrook) who runs afoul of drug dealers leading to a chain of events that inadvertently involves Mike. The father of two young daughters Mike has avoided a criminal path. Instead he drives a limousine and in his off-hours helps train fatherless kids to box. When Mike is imperiled after witnessing Danny murder someone Jimmy steps in to protect him. But Jimmys way is to shoot first and ask no questions later. Soon Mike is in deeper trouble.A high-tech hitman is thrown into the mix played by Common (last seen in a far more intriguing role in Selma). He uses night-vision goggles and infrared targeting system to find his mark but the technology distracts from his performance.Neeson is a master of turbulent characters but hes best in films where those portrayals are essential to a larger cause. In Schindlers List his sense of escalating rage matched the gravity of the situation. In Michael Collins he used violence to fight for freedom.But his avenging anti-hero is played out. Its time to return to more substantive dramatic roles. 13 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1C9mDWZ",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/03/12/run-all-night/70195582/,200,runallnight19,runallnight,usatoday

Photo Myles Aronowitz MOVIE REVIEW Run All Night Running time 114 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity drug abuse). In mob thriller ""Run All Night"" Ed Harris tells Liam Neeson ""We did what we did because we had to."" But some crimes cant be forgiven like ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" or ""Battleship"" or ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""Radio."" Neeson plays Jimmy longtime friend to and assassin for mob boss Sean (Harris). Sean loves Jimmy yet has to kill him while Jimmy is trying to save the life of his son Michael (Joel Kinnaman) who never wants to see him again. ""Run All Night"" is routine in its contours occasionally sloppy in its editing and filled with the usual implausibilities. Although Sean blames both Jimmy and Michael for the death of his son he lets Jimmy walk out of a restaurant early in the film then leaves his hideout only half-defended later on. Yet the film has some exciting action scenes (notably a frenetic chase-and-shoot on Jamaica Avenue in Queens) and takes more care to establish character with smarter dialogue than some of Neesons factory-made thrillers did. Its also an elixir for fans of NYC streetscape porn making use of the kinds of snarly outer-borough locations you dont often see at the movies all chain-link fences and garbage trucks and homeless guys collecting cans and the heavy-metal serenade of elevated trains. Ed Harris and Liam Neeson.Photo Myles Aronowitz The early going makes a point of establishing how deep Jimmy and Seans friendship goes and we get a sense of both Michaels toughness and his kindness in an early gym scene in which he wins a sparring match and gives paternal advice to a fatherless neighborhood lad (because nothing says love like teaching a boy to give and receive head injuries). Dad hasnt had a chance to speak to Michael for years which can happen to you when youve killed 17 men. Michael tells the old man that as a boy he was always stumbling across guns hidden all over the house which to be fair probably happens at Rick Perrys house also. Sean is facing his own fatherhood problem His son (Boyd Holbrook) a moron first tries to set up a heroin deal with Albanian thugs without telling Dad then decides to shoot them all rather than refund the fee that they paid him for pitching the drug idea. Michael who happens to be the limo driver for the Albanians (what are the chances?) witnesses all this which makes the young hothead chase after him when youd think disposing of the three dead bodies in his apartment before the rest of the Albanian mob figures out what he did would be a priority. Liam NeesonPhoto Myles Aronowitz Never mind all that I guess. Director Jaume Collet-Serra keeps the pedal down in scenes such as a fiery free-for-all in a housing project and a fight in which Jimmy strangles a mob soldier in a mens room with one of those cloth belt-style hand towels you used to see in dispensers but were too afraid to touch. Given that contact with one of these things is certainly lethal asphyxiation might be preferable to a slow microbe-induced death later. Neesons whiskey-marinated Catholic anguish isnt exactly new nor is Harriss rueful reflection on years flown. But if its a film that sticks to the old songs at least it plays the hits.

"Run All Night is on the run to nowhere review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRun All Night is on the run to nowhere reviewAnother action flick is usually not a bad thing for Liam Neeson a great actor whose late-career momentum is entirely deserved. But in the case of Run All Night hes barely scraping by the finish line.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 12 2015Run All NightStarring Liam Neeson Ed Harris Joel Kinnaman and Boyd Holbrook. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. At GTA theatres. 14AAnother month another Liam Neeson action movie.Which is usually not a bad thing for a great actor whose late-career momentum is entirely deserved. But in the case of Run All Night hes barely scraping by the finish line.Article Continued BelowIn this abundantly acted yet underachieving film by Jaume Collet-Serra who previously directed the redoubtable Irish star in last years Non-Stop and 2011s Unknown Neeson is Jimmy ""The Gravedigger"" Conlon a Brooklyn mob hit man with a history of violence.Chronically broke and bottled Jimmy is indulged by his career partner Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) a former drug lord who is trying to go straight -- or at least a little bit straighter than he used to be. Both men have adult sons and here the late Paul Newmans observation from Road to Perdition comes to mind ""Sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers.""Jimmys offspring Mike an ex-boxer played by Joel Kinnaman is a family man trying to make ends meet as a chauffeur. He wants nothing to do with his neer-do-well dad.Shawns son Danny played by Boyd Holbrook is a mouthy badass who simply wants to pick up where his papa left off in the drug trade.Liam Neeson stars in Run All Night.Its a situation ripe for trouble and the two families tragically collide. Jimmy and Mike must reluctantly join forces if theyre going to survive a long night of guns. The Maguire family meanwhile have a bloody score to settle.This all sounds good and it sometimes is especially whenever Neeson and Harris are together on the screen. Theyre able to act their way through the inane dialogue of screenwriter Brad Ingelsby (Out of the Furnace) whos never heard a crime cliche he didnt love.Collet-Serra has an interesting approach with a camera -- he makes New York look both shiny and dirty at the same time -- and hes assembled an A1 cast.The lineup also include Common as a rival hit man Vincent DOnofrio as a cop with an agenda (and conscience) and an unbilled Nick Nolte as a Conlon family relation. And hey -- isnt that Oscar-winning J.K. Simmons in the background as the hockey announcer on TV?Yet these actors are ill-served by a film that doesnt know which way its going.Collet-Serra seems untroubled by storytelling lapses going in more for a graphic novel approach where the logic leaps from panel to panel. You can almost imagine white rectangles around each frame.He cant even bother to maintain consistency with the title. For a film called Run All Night there are an awful lot of detours and dead ends.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By Warner Bros. Pictures on Publish Date March 12 2015. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed Yes ""Run All Night"" is another action film starring Liam Neeson with a title as generic as you might expect. But the movie directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who directed Mr. Neeson in the efficient airborne thriller ""Non-Stop"" has two saving graces a tight script and terrific acting. Photo Liam Neeson left is an enforcer on a killing spree to protect his son played by Joel Kinnaman in ""Run All Night."" Credit Myles Aronowitz/Warner Brothers Mr. Neeson plays Jimmy Conlon a longtime enforcer for the underworld boss Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris). Jimmy -- alcoholic and estranged from his son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) a father of two who is determined to avoid his fathers career path -- feels pangs of remorse after a life of violence. But when Shawns hotheaded son Danny (Boyd Holbrook) tries to kill Mike Jimmy bumps him off as well as two crooked cops and suddenly the New York Police Department and seemingly every hoodlum in the city including his former friend and employer are combing Manhattan and its environs on a manhunt. Photo Ed Harris as an underworld boss in Jaume Collet-Serras action film. Credit Myles Aronowitz/Warner Brothers But amid the brawls shootouts and chases the exquisitely matched Mr. Neeson and Mr. Harris share a layered nuanced relationship. Also on point are Nick Nolte as Jimmys brother; Vincent DOnofrio as a sympathetic detective; and Common as a high-tech hit man. Towering over all is Mr. Neeson who combines a rough-hewed authority with a blazing emotional core. I wont defend ""Taken 2"" but lets face facts Mr. Neeson is the best actor the action genre has had in decades.""Run All Night"" is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bloody urban mayhem. Great performances.

(Myles Aronowitz/Warner Bros. Pictures) Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Run All Night 3.0 stars Starring Liam Neeson Joel Kinnaman Ed Harris Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra Duration One hour 54 minutes For several minutes Run All Night the latest Liam-Neeson-Kills-People movie is an actual ""movie"" in a very old-fashioned sense. That is to say that two accomplished actors Liam Neeson and Ed Harris face off with nothing but a restaurant table-and-chair communicating in silences and some carefully-crafted words about the sad inevitability of a coming bloodbath - one fueled by the death of a son and an almost-Shakespearean sense of tragedy and consequence. The characters are Jimmy ""The Gravedigger"" Conlon (Neeson) and his mob boss and lifelong friend Shawn Maguire (Harris). In the olden days you could expect more moments like this occasionally punctuated by scenes of violence that would intrude like a slap in the face. In the context of a movie like the aptly-named Run All Night its one of the few moments where the movie stops to take a breath from all the carnage. So lets dispense with the nostalgia (though the scene above really does remind you that these two can actually act) and consider how well Run All Night quacks alongside other ducks - like say any of the Taken movies. For mobile users click here to watch the trailer Purely in a technical sense director Jaume Collet-Serra is a cut above most action directors. The man who made the underrated creep-fest Orphan turns out to have more in his bag of tricks than the vice-like ability to tighten tension. Apparently theres also a syringe of adrenaline in there too. Run All Night - in which Jimmy and his estranged son Michael (a grim Joel Kinnaman) alternately flee for their lives and fight back - swoops through the streets of New York City like the unseen demons in The Evil Dead. It uses pieces of scenery as ""wipes"" to jarringly move from place to place. There are even a few twists on some action movie tropes - including a car chase where the cop car is uncharacteristically the chase-ee. That said its well-crafted creative wrapping over a lot of empty noise. The funniest line in hindsight comes early in the movie when Vincent DOnofrio (playing apparently the only non-corrupt cop in the city) meets Jimmy in a Diner and tries to prey on his conscience asking him rhetorically whether his career kill-count was 16 or 17. Really? Heck that many people get killed before the first act is over. Neeson could have done that alone without the jarringly incongruous presence of Common as a Terminator-like contract-killer (whose lack of dialogue makes Arnold look like a chatterbox). Oh and speaking of quick hits watch for Nick Noltes single scene (Is it in his contract that he has to look like a homeless guy? Does he even need makeup?) The simple premise - the mob and their cop allies in shoot-to-kill mode against Jimmy Michael and his wife and kids - is transparently a means to an end. Or rather to the bloody end of scores of characters who seem less real than first-person-shooter video game targets. In the context of what movies mean in the 21st Century though its a non-stop bloody roller-coaster fun-ride. jim.sloteksunmedia.ca jimslotek Readers comments >> By adding a comment on the site you accept our terms and conditions.

Comments click to enlarge Run All Night Video Rated R  114 minutes  2015 Explaining the convoluted backstory in this Liam Neeson actioner would take more space than I have here so Ill just cut to the chase--his character a broken-down hit man goes on the run with his estranged upright son (Joel Kinnaman) to save the young man from a ruthless mob boss (Ed Harris). Unfortunately the convoluted backstory is the only thing that makes this worth seeing the mobster and the hit man are old friends and the hit man was forced to kill the mobsters son to save his own boys life. Why doesnt the mobster just kill the hit man instead of chasing after the son who he knows is innocent? Well I told you it was convoluted. Jaume Collet-Serra directed a cast that includes Vincent DOnofrio and Bruce McGill the latter of whom is squandered as a thug with almost no dialogue. By J.R.

"Run All Night (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Run All Night (R) Gangsters and hit men again with Liam Neeson and Ed Harris. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/12/2015 Editor rating 2.5 The sins of the father visit violently on the son in Run All Night aka ""This Years Shoot-Em-Up in Which Someone Messes with Liam Neesons Family."" Although the actor hasnt turned his back entirely on the serious films (Schindlers List Michael Collins) that made him famous -- hes currently starring in Silence for Martin Scorsese due in 2016 -- he has carved out a lucrative niche for himself cranking out popular formulaic action pictures many of which center on his efforts to rescue his missing [insert close relative here]. In these films Neeson comes off as a more gifted commanding Charles Bronson which helps elevate these rote exercises in genre and distract you from the fact that many of these movies are at heart complete nonsense. The same goes for Run All Night in which Neeson plays Jimmy ""The Gravedigger"" Conlon a retired world-weary hit man leading a destitute life and estranged from his grown son (Joel Kinnaman). He still keeps in touch with his former boss and best friend the Brooklyn gangster Shawn (Ed Harris) who occasionally throws Jimmy an easy job usually an errand for his loose-cannon son (Boyd Holbrook) who is in line to inherit his fathers criminal enterprise even though he lacks his old mans smarts or finesse. Unfolding over the course of a single increasingly desperate night (a la the underrated Running Scared starring Paul Walker) Jimmy is forced to protect the life of his son while dodging a dogged detective (Vincent DOnofrio) hellbent on arresting him for his former crimes and a series of killers (including Common cutting a fearsome figure) Shawn sets loose on him after an unfortunate accident. Director Jaume Collet-Serra who hoodwinked the audience big time with the fantastic bad-seed thriller Orphan and has since gotten into the Liam Neeson business (Non-Stop Unknown) makes good use of real New York locations that contribute to the films gritty no-nonsense feel even though he plays fast and loose with geography (in one scene Neeson crosses 42nd Street and Broadway to enter Madison Square Garden). Those types of meaningless details stand out in a crime thriller that is otherwise well thought-out and for the most part plausible although there are moments that push the edges of credibility. I dont know about you but if someone pressed my head against a white-hot sheet of metal during a fight and seared off half my face Id have to pause and cut loose with a few ""Man that burns"" before rejoining the fray. Although Run All Night makes a big deal of the characters Irish heritage the film doesnt really do much with it (for a richer exploration of the Irish crime underworld in America check out 1990s State of Grace starring Sean Penn and Gary Oldman). The movie is also briefly sidelined by one of those unbilled and unnecessary cameos that stop the picture cold while you sit there wondering ""Hey isnt that ... ? Yeah it is"" and then the scene is over. Despite the lack of substance Run All Night is far better than those clunky Taken movies with their timid PG-13 ratings. If youre gonna cut Neeson loose against the mob a bloody R is the way to go. And although the actor could coast through this kind of vehicle by now he still puts effort into his performance Jimmy isnt one of Neesons unstoppable wolf-punching machines. Hes vulnerable racked by guilt and severely outnumbered and there are several times in the movie in which he uses his wits instead of bullets to extricate himself from a difficult situation. In this kind of picture thats called a plot twist. Cast Liam Neeson Ed Harris Joel Kinnaman Boyd Holbrook Common Vincent DOnofrio Bruce McGill Genesis Rodriguez. Director Jaume Collet-Serra.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Director Jaume Collet-Serras third consecutive Liam Neeson movie Run All Night feels like a letdown after the Euro-thriller twists of Unknown and the locked-room crisscrossing of Non-Stop. Working again with a ticking-clock premise--which finds hit man Jimmy (Neeson) ripping through New York in order to keep his Irish mob buddies from killing his estranged son Mike (Joel Kinnaman)--Collet-Serra cant seem to organize the same sense of urgency even as he zips through boroughs and buildings in elaborate Panic Room-style digital composites. But even though he never gets a grip on the over-complicated plot the director hasnt lost his knack for those elemental qualities that make a good action flick. This is a movie of men facing off in rail yards minutes before dawn scaling geometrically perfect housing project balconies and giving chase through rows of backyards leaping every wire fence as though it were an Olympic hurdle--deadly endurance tests staged in nocturnal decrepit urban space.At the bottom of it all is an archetypal battle of wills between Jimmy and big boss Shawn (Ed Harris) the first honest-to-God antagonist to grace one of Neesons violent thrillers. Jimmy is basically Liam Neeson Bingo an alcoholic widower haunted by guilt once feared but now a harmless joke who dresses up as Santa for the other mobsters kids in exchange for booze and pocket money. Shawn is his protector the millionaire kingpin who fixes Jimmy hangover meals; corny as it may sound he seems to genuinely love the guy. And when a convoluted series of events--involving Shawns idiot son and a heroin deal gone bad--sets them against each other they seem less angry than hurt. If Run All Night were a contest to prove which actor can take a pulp script more seriously then Neeson and Harris would be in a dead heat. Since Neesons post-Taken reinvention as a Charles Bronson-esque action star its become common for critics to refer to his commanding presence as though it were classing up material that would otherwise be below him. But the truth is that at this point Neeson mostly stars in movie that seem written (or at least significantly re-written) for him; the projects he chooses are so consistent in theme that he has as much of a claim to authorship as anyone else. Run All Night--fixated on grief regret alcoholism and impending death--is no exception. ""We cross that line together"" is a line Jimmy and Shawn echo back to each other throughout the movie. Its supposed to symbolize a mindset and a bond but perhaps inadvertently it also connects the movies attitude toward death with Collet-Serras preoccupation with city grids and architectural geometries. As far as Run All Night is concerned action is all about crossing lines cars smashing through lanes of traffic figures weaving through subway cars walls getting slammed through friends and family killing each other. The movie piles on crooked cops good cops neighborhood kids high-tech contract killers and even Albanian gangsters a Neeson classic. Underneath all those squiggles of plot and subplot however is something simpler and more fundamental.

"Review Run All Night exhausts genres conventions - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Run All Night exhausts genres conventionsBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 03/10/2015 120000 PM PDTUpdated 03/11/2015 021742 PM PDT What a strange career Liam Neeson has had.The Irish-born actor who earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for 1993s ""Schindlers List"" has become Hollywoods go-to guy for playing distraught avengers. The ""Taken"" franchise -- which prompted two sequels -- about a furious daddy out to save his daughter was an out-of-nowhere international sensation. More disposable entries in Neesons oeuvre -- the ridiculous ""Non-Stop"" and the god-awful ""Clash of the Titans"" -- are giggly guilty pleasures. Every now and then Neeson hits the jackpot again as he did in Joe Carnahans existential 2012 thriller ""The Grey.""Yet even when Neeson lands in a dubious project he makes for good company perfect at creating an imposing conflicted persona his thespian muscle adding meat to thin material. Such is the case with the innocuously titled but slightly better than expected ""Run All Night.""Teaming up again with director Jaume Collet-Saure (""Non-Stop"" ""Unknown"") ""Run All Night"" is a gripping entirely predictable ticking-clock thriller. What distinguishes mostly is Neeson. As Jim Connolly a drunken excuse for a father and human being he elevates another rage-fueled action flick that gets hamstrung by its adherence to conventions.Advertisement His performance as a dad out to save the life of his decent family-man son isnt what entirely fuels ""Run All Night."" A dynamo group of actors -- specifically Ed Harris as his friend-turned nemesis and Joel Kinnaman (2014s ""RoboCop"") playing his earnest son -- elevates the film by creating characters you care about. Also turning in fine performances are Common as a Terminator-resilient hit man and Vincent DOnofrio as one of the few honest NYPD cops out to take down Jimmy. Where it goes wrong is with the screenplay which leaps from impressive to slipshod. Brad Ingelsby who scripted the tired ""Out of the Furnace"" with Christian Bale is indeed a clever writer with a keen ear for dialogue but his narrative isnt distinctive enough and the last third of the film is simply illogical.That said the setup is gripping. Two friends -- Jimmy (Neeson) and Shawn (Harris) -- are trying to distance themselves from their violent pasts together. Shawn has moved on and advanced his mob biz empire by becoming more legit. Thats not the case with Jimmy who remains haunted and emotionally crippled numbing himself with booze. (L-R) Genesis Rodriguez as Gabriela Conlon and Joel Kinnaman as Mike Conlon in Run All Night. (Myles Aronowitz/Warner Bros. Pictures) ( Myles Aronowitz/Warner Bros. Pic ) Enter Shawns hotheaded hopped-up son Danny (Boyd Holbrook) who needs to pay off a loan. He expects Dad to help by running heroin for the guys hes in debt to but Dad wont chip in. So the thugs demanding the cash show up and it just so happens -- as coincidences tend to pile up in films like this -- the limo driver ferrying the mobsters to Dannys apartment is Jimmys son upright family man Mike (Kinnaman).An intense showdown and botched plans -- both well-directed and scripted -- speed the rest of the story into a classic chase film as an estranged father (Neeson) and son (Kinnaman) try to evade dirty cops and an infuriated revenge-seeking Shawn. The result is numerous tightly choreographed action sequences all bracingly pulled off by Collet-Saura who uses among other devices trippy overhead Google-like map views to zoom into neighborhoods or smack into the action.The best moment has nothing to do with chases or bullets. Its a tense meet-up between Neeson and Harris that reminds you just a bit of that exchange between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in ""Heat."" The heavily lidded looks the inevitable realization that all will end badly ratchet up our emotional investment. The two veteran actors couldnt be better in conveying that sense of dread.For all their efforts though ""Run All Night"" often is so rote it seems to be jogging in place. Even its opening -- which finds Neeson gasping for air and staring at his mortality before were thrust back in time -- is an overused device. Weve been up and down this road before and even though Kinnaman Neeson and Harris make interesting passengers the overused tires in ""Run All Night"" go bald.

More seasoned watchers of the ""Liam Neeson Kills a Bunch of People"" movies know that some of the best ones are directed by Catalan filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra previously responsible for such trashy delights as ""Liam Neeson Kills a Bunch of People on an Airplane"" (aka ""Non-Stop"") and ""Liam Neeson Kills a Bunch of People Despite Having Amnesia"" ""Unknown""). See Video Liam Neeson Is a Hit Man Fighting to Keep His Son Alive in %u2018Run All Night%u2019 Trailer (Video) If you had a blast at those movies as I did youre more than likely to enjoy ""Liam Neeson Kills a Bunch of People in One Night Before Christmas to Make Up for Previously Being a Lousy Dad"" hitting theaters under the more marquee-friendly title ""Run All Night."" We open with Neeson lying in a forest bleeding from a shotgun wound just to make it clear that despite the leading man and the Yuletide setting this is absolutely not a sequel to ""Love Actually."" The film then launches back 16 hours to introduce us to Jimmy Conlon (Neeson) a boozy former hitman now reduced to playing Santa at a party for Danny Maguire (Boyd Holbrook ""Gone Girl"") the never-do-well son of Shawn (Ed Harris) Jimmys former boss and the only friend Jimmy has left in the world. This Christmas sees Jimmy once again estranged from family particularly son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) who doggedly remains on the straight and narrow to distance himself from his father -- and the only person who seems to take any interest in Jimmy is Detective Harding (Vincent DOnofrio) who still hopes to bust the retired button-man for all the Shawn-ordered hits of his past. See Video %u2018Taken 4%u2032 Is Here Courtesy of Jimmy Kimmel and Liam Neeson (Video) Chauffeur Mike as bad luck would have it witnesses Danny murdering two Albanian drug traffickers. As worse luck would have it Danny pursues Mike to his house where Jimmy shoots Danny to save Mikes life. (And if you havent seen the trailer trust me this is just the set-up and not a spoiler.) Jimmy confesses to Shawn offering up his own life if Shawn will absolve Mike but nothing doing; the grief-stricken mobster insists for the sake of revenge that Jimmy must live long enough see Mike get killed threatening to put Mikes wife Gabrielle (Genesis Rodriguez) and their two young children in the crossfire if anyone gets in his way. Thus begins an evening-long chase of Jimmy calling on all his professional know-how to save the son who hates him (the NYPD is no help since Shawn and Danny had plenty of cops on the payroll) and the pursuit gets even hairier when Shawn throws professional assassin Mr. Price (Common) who has his own grudge with Jimmy into the mix. Collet-Serra and screenwriter Brad Ingelsby (""Out of the Furnace"") keep the action moving at a brisk pace throwing in plenty of elaborate set pieces including a high-speed cop-car chase through Queens a fire in an enormous housing project and the crowds departing Madison Square Garden after a Rangers-Devils game. Between explosions old pros Neeson and Harris paint a rich portrait of a long friendship turned into a brutal rivalry; Kinnaman is less successful with the bitter-son dialogue but the film wisely keeps him from growing too forgiving too fast. (Would that the movie had found more for Nick Nolte and Bruce McGill to do as Jimmys brother and Shawns second in command respectively.) Also Read John Legend and Common%u2019s %u2018Glory%u2019 Sees Strong Sales Amid Oscar Buzz Cinematographer Martin Ruhe (""The American"") definitely subscribes to the Everything Looks Cool from a Helicopter school transitioning from scene to scene with overhead swoops and zoom-ins in a style that could be called Google Earth Hopscotch. The set decorators work the holiday motif effectively into the film although 2014 and probably only a Christmas movie nerd like me would even notice 2014 the seasonal flair all happens indoors and never outside suggesting that the exteriors were shot before Thanksgiving or after New Years. ""Run All Night"" has its flaws to be sure -- composer Junkie XL leans a little heavily on the ""BWAH"" that has quickly become a cliche in the years since ""Inception"" and the third act is overly drawn out a situation made all the more apparent by that opening shot that forecasts the climax. (Theres also a subplot about Jimmys mom being in the hospital making us wonder why Shawns thugs never think to look for Jimmy there but this is a movie where asking such questions is never encouraged.) These minor issues aside however theres a gritty pulpy momentum to the film that keeps the pace propulsive if not exhilarating. Theres not much new in this tale of grim men staring and then shooting each other down but this cast and crew know how to spin this yarn with efficacy and economy.

TWITTER Liam Neeson is once again in kick-ass mode as a Brooklyn hitman on a marathon mission. Liam Neeson moves one step closer to becoming the new Charles Bronson in Run All Night the latest slab of amped-up urban mayhem hes found to perpetuate his rugged-leading-man-of-a-certain-age success now that the Taken series has run its course. Playing a longtime Brooklyn hitman who gets to take down a few more baddies during a long nights journey to oblivion the actor has again found a violence-based story driven by family threat and the basest human emotions which along with clockwork outbursts of nasty low-life action look to deliver a quick domestic payday and a heftier one overseas. ""Ive done some terrible things in my life"" admits Neesons Jimmy Conlon who in his prime was so fearsome that he was nicknamed the Gravedigger although it now looks certain that the last grave he digs will be his own. In Neesons 2014 collaboration with director Jaume Collet-Serra Non-Stop the actors sky marshal character was an alcoholic -- and thats true here once again. Jimmy is a wreck constantly in his cups and quite without friends other than old cohort Shawn (Ed Harris). Read more Taken 3 Supplier Calls for Gun Industry to Boycott Liam Neeson Films The two Irish blokes started out together in a tough neighborhood with Shawn rising to the top and using Jimmy as his go-to trigger man. Shawn is now rich respectable and ready to retire while Jimmy is such a Bad Santa that his own son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) doesnt want him anywhere near him his wife or young kids. By contrast Shawns thirtyish son Danny (Boyd Holbrook) is still trying to prove himself to his old man but hasnt even learned the basics starting with lesson one Dont get on the wrong side of Albanian drug dealers (Neesons Taken character could have told him as much). The whole bloody business of the script by Brad Ingelsby (Out of the Furnace) stems from Dannys colossal blunder of trying to force his father into business with these vermin but when Jimmy is forced to kill the reckless Danny blood brother Shawn is obliged to hunt him down. The titles meaning kicks in here as Jimmy has to move like hell all through New York City to keep one step ahead of Shawn as well as a cop (Vincent DOnofrio) whos been trying to nail him for 30 years and Shawns new favorite hitman Price (Common) whose poised relentlessness could make him a blood brother to Denzel Washingtons titular character in The Equalizer. See more If Only Every Liam Neeson Movie Were a Taken Movie (Photos) Set on a snowless unfrosty Christmas Eve that looks like it was shot around September the story keeps everyone in motion all night long and frantically so to the point that it could easily have been titled Non-Stop 2. Mike an unwilling participant in his fathers nonsense has to keep his family out of harms way while Jimmy bounces around the boroughs like a pinball in an effort to set things straight before his pursuers knock everyone off himself included. Its hard to deny that some degree of ingenuity was required to figure out how to festoon this elemental story with enough moving parts and blasts of action to fill it out to feature length. On the other hand no effort was expended to make it geographically coherent (unlike the recent Nightcrawler which was impeccable in this respect); Jimmy can be in the Bronx one moment and Midtown the next then out in the woods somewhere to duel with Price. Add to this the jittery images which sometimes make you think the handheld camera is so hot no one can bear to hold on to it for more than a few seconds and you have a film that if nothing else cant be accused of sitting still. The movie consists entirely of angry threats pointed guns hiding out from and eluding same and mad dashes down mean streets on foot and in vehicles. The characters are uniformly uncouth and unhappy and the sudden appearance of an unbilled Nick Nolte provokes a double-take (just to figure out of its really him) that lasts about as long as his screen time.

"Run All Night Review Its Still Not a Good Idea to Mess With Liam Neesons Family | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Run All Night Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 12 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 10 2015 | 1000AM PT Liam Neeson does his thing and does it well in this robustly satisfying Irish-American mob thriller. Someday the mobsters petty thugs and crooked cops of the world will finally get it through their thick skulls that you should never ever mess with Liam Neesons family -- not that audiences have reason to complain in the meantime so long as they keep getting action pictures as straightforward and robustly satisfying as ""Run All Night."" In his third and arguably most effective partnership with director Jaume Collet-Serra (after ""Unknown"" and ""Non-Stop"") the 62-year-old Neeson puts his world-weary killer instincts to good use as an aging Brooklyn hit man trying to protect his estranged son -- a twist that pushes this tense elegantly assembled chase thriller into full-on male-weepie territory so heavy with sins-of-the-fathers anguish that it almost plays out like a latter-day ""Road to Perdition."" Yet Collet-Serra keeps things moving so nimbly that the emotions never turn leaden suggesting that this Warner Bros. programmer could display some much-needed commercial stamina in a season of box office disappointments. In less assured hands movie titles like ""Non-Stop"" and ""Run All Night"" might have promised something of a viewer endurance test rather than the efficient fleet-footed genre exercises that have gratifyingly emerged. After a shaky but intriguing start with 2011s ""Unknown"" Collet-Serra and Neeson have proven themselves to be expert recyclers devising a series of brawny standalone entertainments delivered with enough smarts and style -- not that a whole lot is required mind -- to outclass the actors ""Taken"" franchise. (Last years ""Non-Stop"" even managed to outpace the recent ""Taken 3"" domestically earning 92 million Stateside to the latter pics 88 million.) This time around however director and star have dispensed with their earlier Hitchcockian wrong-man scenarios. Theres no mistaking Neeson for anything but the right man in ""Run All Night"" -- namely Jimmy Conlon an Irish-American mafioso who knows his pursuers all too well and can scarcely begrudge them for wanting to hunt him down. Remarkably despite the narratives compact 16-hour time frame an entire gangland history manages to come into fleeting focus as Collet-Serra freights even the most offhand exchanges of dialogue (and gunfire) with a disquieting intimacy that underscores his characters shared experience Whether conceived on a grand scale or in close quarters the violence always feels personal. If theres a weakness in the clean economical screenplay by Brad Ingelsby (who co-scripted 2013s ""Out of the Furnace"") its that Neesons character seems perhaps too forlorn a figure at the outset an impression that doesnt entirely jibe with the keen-witted man of action who emerges later. Once known as ""the Gravedigger"" the deadliest arrow in the quiver of respected Brooklyn kingpin Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) Jimmy is now a hopeless hanger-on stuck nursing a lifetimes worth of regrets with endless glasses of whiskey and forced to earn quick cash by performing humiliating favors for Shawns son and heir Danny (Boyd Holbrook). Handsome spoiled callow and monstrous Danny has clearly absorbed the elder Maguires ruthlessness but none of his professional scruples or life knowledge. By contrast Jimmys lone son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) has become a paragon of working-class virtue -- a dutiful family man who wants nothing to do with his old man and his life of crime. With the various intergenerational contrasts and parallels thus established all the long-simmering tensions suddenly explode one winter evening when Mike a limo driver in the wrong place at the wrong time witnesses Danny blowing away an Albanian heroin dealer. (For all its general superiority to the ""Taken"" movies ""Run All Night"" is no improvement in the ethnic sensitivity department.) In short order Mike is forced to renew ties with the hated Jimmy his only hope of staying alive and ensuring the safety of his pregnant wife (Genesis Rodriguez) and two daughters (Giulia Cicciari Carrington Meyer). In one of the scripts shrewder gambits Jimmys instinctive decision to side with his own blood has the immediate effect of severing all ties to his employer something both sides accept with almost matter-of-fact resignation. Viewers may be reminded of the similarly strict gangland protocols that governed last years Keanu Reeves starrer ""John Wick"" in which longtime business associates faced with an unexpected personal betrayal calmly negotiated the terms under which they would proceed to obliterate each other. Liberated from the confines of a 767 in ""Non-Stop"" Collet-Serra fully embraces his newfound sense of visual freedom sending the camera whooshing in all directions across the city -- a mode of transitioning between scenes that feels a trifle flashy yet potently conveys the storys scope. (Brian Heller is credited with the aerial photography.) Although Ingelsbys script was originally set in his hometown of Philadelphia ""Run All Night"" turns out to be one of the more immersive New York-shot genre movies of recent vintage benefiting from d.p. Martin Ruhes moody nocturnal lensing and production designer Sharon Seymours richly conceived sets; many of the fictional backdrops used from Shawns Irish-pub HQ to the boxing gym in the Bronx where Mike trains neighborhood kids draw upon (and sometimes artfully combine) locations in different boroughs. No less impressive is the films integration of the citys topography and architecture into its most ambitious action sequences from a palpably tense car chase through the streets of Brooklyn (ultimately ending in a sly visual shortcut at a pawn shop in Queens) to a daring escape filmed during the chaotic aftermath of a Rangers-Devils game at Madison Square Garden. Perhaps most daunting of all is a setpiece that covers multiple floors of a burning apartment complex as the Conlons set out to protect an innocent kid witness (Aubrey Omari Joseph) while dodging a skilled contract killer (Common a long way from ""Selma""). Through it all whether incorporating parkour moves into a breathless foot chase or staging a climactic three-way manhunt in the foggy wilderness near Putnam N.Y. Collet-Serra displays a level of crafty professionalism and logistical knowhow worthy of his resourceful protagonists. With its grim fatalistic twists and brooding air of patriarchal anxiety -- this is a world where sons are doomed to suffer the consequences of their fathers mistakes or repeat them to even more damaging effect -- ""Run All Night"" doesnt exactly cover new ground. (One narrative digression feels particularly unnecessary in its attempt to crank up Mikes resentment of Jimmy; mainly it exists to justify an unbilled cameo from an actor whose presence is welcome but not essential.) Yet even when hes dealing with this boilerplate material Collet-Serra brings an understated intensity and a subtle emotional pull to every scene aided immeasurably by actors who invest their roles big and small with just the right degree of conviction. By now it should come as a surprise to no one that Neeson has become perhaps our most consistently reliable and bankable action hero and ""Run All Night"" ably taps into his reserves of grit and gravitas as Jimmy leaps into action takes down enemy assailants and above all protects those he loves even if it means sometimes ramming them off the road. As ever the actors handsome careworn face seems capable of projecting decency and tenderness as well as cruelty perfect for the role of a cold-blooded killer we intuitively trust. Jimmys interactions with his old friend-turned-nemesis Shawn are among the films most affecting moments not least because Harris is one of the few actors capable of looking utterly dead-eyed while still possessing a certain soulful twinkle. Also leaving strong impressions are Bruce McGill as Shawns formidable No. 2 and Vincent DOnofrio as one of the few honest cops in a city overrun with police corruption. Kinnaman who anchored last years ""RoboCop"" reboot more than holds his own opposite Neeson while revealing a crucial dimension of vulnerability. Although a physically tough specimen himself Mike is a man for whom violence doesnt come naturally and Jimmy is determined to keep it that way repeatedly intervening so that his son will never know the soul-crushing agony of taking a life even in self-defense. Its an overtly moralistic vaguely Catholic touch and one that cant help but ring slightly false in a movie that like so many of Neesons assignments of late turns the spectacle of mass killing into a job well done.

Dihana says January 8 2016 at 525 pm The director of Run All Night Jaume Collet-Serra has done big mistake with the language in this film. In the limo they speak Serbian language not Albanian language. It is a language mistake that affects the value of the film. Reply Big Rosie says March 21 2015 at 557 pm Just saw the movie last night and it was EPIC Liam is a God I know he will stop making action movies soon and he will be missed. There are not a lot of action stars left who dont wear costumes. I miss the Mel Gibson Bruce Willis Arnold Schwarzenegger Jackie Chan days. (Even you Steven Seagal). Reply Bob Sherfy says March 21 2015 at 550 pm Excellent movie. Great acting. Compelling music and great scenes of New York. Reply Big Rosie says March 21 2015 at 558 pm Agreed Reply SarahWNY (SarahWNY) says March 11 2015 at 725 pm ""Jibe"" not ""jive."" Reply Karla Sofen (KSofen) says March 11 2015 at 900 am I wonder if the NRA boycott of the film will hurt the box office? Neeson was spouting the usual anti-gun drivel while making movies glorifying the use of the gun and upsetting PARA USA the makers of the guns he used in the movie. Maybe these stars just need to shut up and quit appointing themselves to expert? Reply Cindylover1969 says March 11 2015 at 531 am Thanks for not giving away who turns up (unlike ""The Hollywood Reporter""). Reply Irene Tsobanakis says March 10 2015 at 148 pm Nice review Mr. Chang. Im looking forward to seeing the movie Reply jhs39 says March 10 2015 at 1221 pm Looks cool. Could use a good Liam Neeson action flick to wipe away the taste of Taken 3. Reply Byrdlover says March 10 2015 at 1107 am Ditto  Reply Giacomo Knox (giacoknox) says March 10 2015 at 1047 am Let me save you 12 and about two hours aging gun-grabbing armed-bodyguard employing multimillionaire makes another movie where he uses guns in an illegitimate manner. Im sure hes reading my review from his palatial estate surrounded by his smug Eurocentric viewpoint and said bodyguards. F you Liam. The Emerald Isle wants you back. Reply Fred Mertz says March 10 2015 at 720 pm Let Liam blow it out your ass Giacomo.
