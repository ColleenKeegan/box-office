From celebrants at an elegant 14th century ball breaking into wild modern dancing to the strains of David Bowies ""Golden Years"" to the prince of Wales shouting a clenched-fist ""Yes"" this survey of the European jousting season circa 1360 imposes contempo behavior phraseology and attitudes onto inhabitants of the Middle Ages with gleeful abandon. Rarely has a period costume picture been quite so craven in courting a young audience as ""A Knights Tale."" From celebrants at an elegant 14th century ball breaking into wild modern dancing to the strains of David Bowies ""Golden Years"" to the prince of Wales shouting a clenched-fist ""Yes"" this survey of the European jousting season circa 1360 imposes contempo behavior phraseology and attitudes onto inhabitants of the Middle Ages with gleeful abandon. Clearly designed as a star-making vehicle for young Aussie actor Heath Ledger and positively swilling in its deliberate anachronisms Brian Helgelands boisterous profoundly silly actioner will deeply divide audiences; traditionalists and older viewers in general will scoff while pop culture addicts will no doubt go with the flow enough so to give Sony a hit. So thoroughly does the driving force behind ""A Knights Tale"" feel like a marketing strategy rather than an impulse to tell a story that the character of the film is accurately and entirely summed up by its ad campaign tag line ""He Will Rock You."" But little does one suspect going in that the Queen song of nearly the same name will be used as the pictures anthem blasting out during the pivotal early scene in which William Thatcher (Ledger) an English commoner footloose in France dons the armor of a dead jouster to compete in the nobles-only sport. His immediate success with a lance launches William on a brilliant career once some phony lineage documents are fashioned by a young vagabond (Paul Bettany) who introduces himself by proclaiming ""Geoffrey Chaucers the name writings the game"" and who shortly joins motley squires Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk) in the entourage of the impetuous warrior now known as Ulrich von Lichtenstein of Gelderland. Pic plays its major hand right away with the arena-rock tunes (""The Boys Are Back in Town"" and ""I Want to Take You Higher"" among others) accompanied by such sights as medieval tournament audiences gesturing in unison and even doing the wave. Viewers who sign on to this conceit at the outset will no doubt take the rest of the film as a larky good time; those who resist the flagrant incongruities (which stop well short of Monty Pythonesque spoofing) will be gritting their teeth for the next two hours. Unfortunately whatever narrative skills Helgeland contributed to the Oscar-winning script of ""L.A. Confidential"" have dissipated into the flatline chronology of an athletic season depicted here. Beginning in the French countryside and moving along to tourneys in Rouen Lagny-sur-Marne Bordeaux Paris and finally to the championship in London tale never burdens itself with any subplots or complexity offering only an under-motivated rivalry between an arrogant cheating aristocrat Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) and young William who defies the rigid class system by announcing ""A man can change his stars."" Of course William does become romantically distracted taking a fancy to a willful noblewoman Jocelyn (Shanynn Sossamon) whom William calls ""my foxy lady"" and whose fashionably trim apparel would make her right at home in Milan or Miami Beach today. Only at her command as a test of his love for her will William ever lose a match and his otherwise unimpaired ability to win against all opponents quickly amounts to a stupid decision dramatically as the flattening of the roller coaster of incident mitigates against any suspense. A smidgen of poignance surfaces as an afterthought in the late-going when William locates his long-lost blind father (Christopher Cazenove) in London only to have the reunion reveal the truth about his lowly origins. But even this obstacle is easily overcome clearing the way for William to compete in the world finals in an arena made (by Ridley Scotts Mill Film Co. digital effects house) to look nearly as grand and central to 14th century London life as the Colosseum was to ancient Romes. His abundant blond hair tousled to a fare-thee-well and his face a picture of determination that even Kirk Douglas would admire Ledger fills the bill as a jousting-champ-cum-rock star in a turn that should certainly increase his standing with the intended audience. Bettany (who is obliged to appear in the nude for long stretches albeit discreetly enough to ensure a PG-13 rating) Addy and Tudyk are nothing if not noisy and colorful as Williams roistering mates and Laura Fraser tags along for the ride as a blacksmith who fashions special armor for the peoples favorite. Sewell broods and menaces effectively but even in the circumstances newcomer Sossamon is hopelessly modern as the fair maiden with a devil-may-care attitude. Shot entirely in Prague and the surrounding countryside pic was obviously made on a budget but looks good thanks to handsome locations and sets and very resourceful lensing by Richard Greatrex. Ace composer Carter Burwell fights a futile uphill battle to assert his orchestral compositions in the face of the rock n roll outbursts. Viewers who stick around through the entire end credits are rewarded with a kicker scene of Williams crew indulging in a farting competition. For some this will rep a fitting commentary on the entire picture. A Knights TaleProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of an Escape Artists/Finestkind production.

(Columbia Pictures) A knight ther was and that arighteous dude.Of twenty yeer of age he was andfrom the hoode.With armor of iron and bunnesto matchHe had an itch he could not scratch.If only he hadde royal bloodHe coude wel joust and so likewoude. ""A Knights Tale"" makes no apologies to Geoffrey ""Jeff"" Chaucer (Paul Bettany) whose wordsmithery is as crucial to the rise of the low-born William (himbo Heath Ledger) as is the heavy metalwork of his feminist blacksmith (sassy Laura Fraser). Anachronism rules in this high-spirited medieval action-adventure that shucks off period trappings in favor of modern music speech and mannerisms. Writer-director Brian Helgeland and his attractive cast revel in the good-natured nuttiness of the endeavor portraying jousters as the sports stars of their day. King Edward II makes the scene but so does the Queen. Its certain to wow young audiences with its audacity and just as sure to annoy if not outrage older and more conservative viewers. Which would take some doing for folks who grew up on ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" still the unrivaled lampoon of Arthurian lore. ""A Knights Tale"" however is less ambitious fare a romp on the order of ""Rocky"" in chain mail. William a poor but pretty squire realizes his childhood dream when he finds his employer dead puts on the late knights armor and jousts in his stead. Never mind that only nobles may loft a lance and William couldnt hit a barn with a broadsword. Luckily the knight was ahead before he passed and William can win the tourney if he can only stay on his horse. He prevails of course and with the succor of his peasant sidekicks (Alan Tudyk and Mark Addy) hones his skills and sets off in search of another tournament. However there is another hurdle. William lacks papers testifying to his nobility. Luckily the friends meet a troubadour on the highway -- ""Chaucers the name writings the game"" -- who forges a document for William now known as Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein of Gelderland. The poet joins the entourage as Williams herald a duty he performs in the style of a ring announcer with the WWF. His witty intros are among the movies great delights along with crowds of jousting patrons who paint their faces do the wave and thump-thump-clap to the strains of Queens ""We Will Rock You."" The movie promises to rock you and much of the time it does. The action scenes are beautifully mounted and photographed and offer a sense of the rigors of the sport Rearing horses splintering lances crushing blows visors flying through the air. Alas the filmmakers have a hard time topping themselves as the fearless rookie works his way across France gathering greater renown with every tourney until he is finally felled by the cocksure Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell giving a whole new meaning to ham in a can). Adhemar and William are also competitors for the heart of Jocelyn (posturing newcomer Shannyn Sossamon) a designer damsel who owes more to J. Lo than Guinevere. Adhemar has asked for Jocelyns hand but she favors William. She well nigh swoons over Williams poetry which is really written by you know who. Did we mention that the heroic quartets costumes were inspired by the puffy shirts the Rolling Stones wore on their 1972 tour? And if that isnt eclectic enough for you the director manages to work in a Nike logo. Product placement was big then too. ""A Knights Tale"" is no ""Shakespeare in Love."" Indeed the romantic rivalry seems to have been thrown in as a sop for the girls who will nevertheless probably appreciate a look at Ledgers lips in action. In the end its just a Canterbury tailspin in which they uh lance a lot.A Knights Tale (132 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence nudity and brief sex-related dialogue.

Bush U.S. Military al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden gt; Advanced Search Short Takes B O O K S BOOKS PASQUALES NOSE By Michael Rips The medieval Tuscan village of Sutri (pop. about 5000) is inhabited says Rips by sundry eccentrics among them a blind bootmaker an old-timer known to possess supernatural powers in the laying of hands on ailing tractor engines and an illiterate postman. In this slight travel memoir Rips a displaced Nebraskan limns the local characters as well as the Etruscan culture that bred them. These drolleries are best digested over an espresso at a Sutri cafe; failing that any Starbucks will do. BY JESSE BIRNBAUM C I N E M A CINEMA A KNIGHTS TALE Directed by Brian Helgeland Any movie that begins with Queens We Will Rock You underscoring a 14th century jousting tournament cant be all bad. Unfortunately writer-director Helgelands story of a peasant lad (Heath Ledger The Patriots young hunk) who uses knightly skills to attempt a rise above his station is not all good either it cant decide whether to go all out for anachronistic humor or stick to its historical onions. The result is half Python half Ivanhoe--and not as much fun as either. BY RICHARD SCHICKEL M U S I C MUSIC LETS GET LOST Terence Blanchard On this supremely satisfying CD trumpeter Terence Blanchard with the help of four jazz divas pays tribute to the music of songwriting great Jimmy McHugh. Diana Krall whisks in like winter offering a chilly elegant take on the title song; newcomer Jane Monheit is spring with a dewy rendition of Too Young to Go Steady; Dianne Reeves summery I Cant Believe That Youre in Love with Me offers gentle warmth; and Cassandra Wilsons autumnal Sunny Side of the Street is laden with loss but colored with beautiful hues. Blanchard blows his way through these songs with charming restrained invention and a pure vivid tone. BY CHRISTOPHER JOHN FARLEY T E L E V I S I O N TELEVISION CONSPIRACY HBO May 19 9 p.m. E.T.; ANNE FRANK ABC May 20 and 21 9 p.m. E.T. Two inadvertent bookends explore the Holocaust from its deceptively mundane beginning to a heretofore unstaged end. Conspiracy re-enacts the 90-minute meeting in which silky-voiced SS bureaucrat Reinhard Heydrich (Kenneth Branagh) gently bullies a roomful of Nazi functionaries into accepting the Final Solution as a fait accompli. A bloodless yet brutal testament to the violence of euphemism and groupthink--eerily indistinguishable from any middle managers meeting--it is the banality of evil brought unignorably to life. Night One of Anne Frank based on Melissa Mullers 1998 biography is a familiar depiction of the beloved diarist and her familys life in the secret annex. But on Night Two following Frank (Hannah Taylor Gordon) into Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen it becomes a different film. These scenes unflinching and almost without dialogue (the Nazis strip Anne of her clothes her hair and her indomitable spirit) make a hard-to-take but overdue answer to the easy optimism of past Diary productions.

Surely someone jests. Nope. Actually in A Knights Tale they joust. In this misguided medieval muddle that may please aficionados of oldies stations and Xtreme sports but few others Queens stadium anthem We Will Rock You puts the rowdy rabble in the mood before a tournament. They clap along and even engage in a pre-game wave. When lowly squire Heath Ledger (the Colonial cutie in The Patriot) assumes his dead masters identity as well as his knightly duties he practices before a bout to the salsa-hot rhythms of Wars Low Rider. Later lords and ladies at a fancy ball boogie down to David Bowie. Read more Audio Golden Years by David Bowie We Will Rock You by Queen The Boys Are Back in Town by Thin Lizzy Photo Gallery Summer films Sounds like a comedy and titters did erupt when the funky sounds of Sly amp; the Family Stone incongruously blared. But this Tale is nothing if not deadly serious about its playful approach. You have your eager lad aspiring above his station while looking like a refugee from a failed boy band. Then theres a star-crossed romance with a noble-born beauty (Shannyn Sossamon garbed as if she were doing a layout for Ye Olde Vogue) and the boastful WWF-style rival who stands in his way (Rufus Sewell once more a haughty Brit in black). Feminism and capitalism are given their due. A feisty female blacksmith stamps her trademark -- a pair of Nike ""swooshes"" -- on her handiwork. Its a blatant attempt to sell a simple fable set in the Middle Ages to those who are in their teen ages. But less attention should have been paid to the anachronistic frills and more to the cinematography (muddy despite an on-location shoot in the Czech Republic) design (the sets look like leftovers from a high school production of Camelot) and editing (about as zippy as a Gregorian chant). The most serious drawback is the uninvolving nature of jousting itself. Watching two lugs in heavy metal repeatedly charge at each other atop galloping steeds and then batter opponents with unwieldy lances could be photogenic and exciting. But once youve seen one big stick splinter into toothpicks onscreen youve seen em all. You can just hear the post-modern pitch that director/writer/producer Brian Helgeland an Oscar winner for his script for L.A. Confidential made to the studio heads Well put one of those hunky Aussie imports in armor just like Russell Crowe in Gladiator but younger. And we will make him a commoner who rises to greatness just like Mel Gibson in Braveheart and an inspiration to the downtrodden masses akin to Robin Hood complete with semi-merry sidekicks (roly-poly Mark Addy of The Full Monty carrot-topped Alan Tudyk). The most welcome lift however is from Shakespeare in Love. A historical literary figure bursts onto the scene and from the moment he trudges through the woods in his scratched and smudged birthday suit Paul Bettany as a saucy Geoffrey Chaucer takes command. As a sort of PR flack for Ledger his silver-tongued exaggerations of the jousting jocks brave deeds and mighty stature before each match are great fun. As he puts it ""I give the truth scope."" But whenever Bettany departs a severe energy crisis follows. Who would think a man of words could so easily swipe an action flick? This jarring experiment isnt exactly a knightmare. More like a dream unfulfilled neither smashingly audacious nor staidly traditional enough to satisfy either taste. Youll be lulled not rocked.

Written and directed by Brian Helgeland. (PG-13. 132 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Giving the age of chivalry some ol rock n roll attitude slapstick and ""Les Miserables"" sentiment only sounds like a bad idea. In the jousting tournament romp ""A Knights Tale"" its only occasionally annoying. More often than not its fun. Wannabe star Heath Ledger is a wannabe knight in this story of a squire who dons his dead masters armor and goes out on the jousting circuit. Writer-director Brian Helgeland has noticed something about chivalric romances -- they can be starchy as hell. The solution? Give this tired old horse doses of populism high spirits and unabashed sentiment as well as a rock soundtrack. The tawny Ledger Mel Gibsons son in ""The Patriot"" plays squire-turned- knight William Thatcher. He starts out with dreadlocks and beard but is clean- cut for his masquerade as a knight. Learning how to joust isnt enough; he has to learn how to dance too. Its refreshing that Ledger comes across so low-key for someone groomed for stardom. He doesnt throw this movies team effort out of whack. But its Paul Bettany as 14th century writer Geoffrey Chaucer who wins the hearts and minds of the audience. Alert mischievous Bettany plays Chaucer before he became Chaucer so to speak. This is the pre-""Canterbury Tales"" writer who makes his first entrance trudging across the screen stark naked and joins Williams little band of upwardly mobile commoners. Chaucers writing skills so far include forging documents to legitimize Williams claim to noble birth. He turns into the jousters publicist and huckster ring announcer improvising hyperbolic introductions for him at tournaments. Team effort? The jousts could be on ""SportsCenter."" Spectators in the bleachers some of them shirtless get stoked on Queens (not the queens) ""We Will Rock You."" They do the wave. A female armorer who designs lightweight armor for William puts the Nike swoosh on it. A tavern argument turns into a bad night at the sports bar. At a key moment there is even a slo-mo ""march of the champions"" toward the camera. Helgeland won an Oscar for writing the ""L.A. Confidential"" screenplay. ""A Knights Tale"" is a wrong-side-of-the-tracks story from a writer who lets people know he used to make his living on fishing boats. The movie should appeal to anyone who has a soft spot for or identifies with upstarts and fakes. William who calls himself Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein of Gelderland has what amounts to a series of grudge-match jousts with a cocky vain knight played to the hilt by Rufus Sewell who taunts William for his out-of-date armor. The bad guy himself has an iron fist at the end of his lance. ""You have been weighed you have been measured and you have been found wanting"" is his mocking mantra. The two men also are in competition for the hand of high-born Jocelyn played by newcomer Shannyn Sossamon another bundle of anachronisms. The clash of eras extends to Jocelyns wardrobe and hairdo. When she gets gussied up there are bright punk red highlights in her hair. She invites William to a ball which turns into a disco with David Bowie on the soundtrack. A blow to the head in a tournament knocks William back into a childhood memory of his father a thatcher who abandoned him. As the father Christopher Cazenove gives a performance full of heartfelt if overblown sentiment which he plays absolutely sincerely as if no one ever told him what a tearjerker it is. Good for him. The pen is mightier than the lance which gives Chaucer the last word. When someone does him wrong as a mean-spirited Pardoner does the writer is content to eat the dish of revenge cold. ""I will eviscerate you in fiction"" he tells the Pardoner. Advisory This film contains nudity and violence.

"CNN.com - Entertainment - Knights Tale inventive but not always sharp - May 10 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION CAREER IN-DEPTH QUICK NEWS LOCAL COMMUNITY MULTIMEDIA E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe set your edition Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Danish Japanese Korean Arabic Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW A man on horseback -- with a point Knights Tale inventive but not always sharp In this story Rockin the jousting tournament Impetuous youth impossible dreams RELATED SITES By Paul Clinton CNN Reviewer (CNN) -- ""A Knights Tale"" is not your typical medieval story about knights in shining armor ladies in waiting and gallant deeds performed with the help of exotic wizards. This story set in 14th-century Europe does have some of those elements. But it also has a pounding sound track featuring music from Eric Clapton AC/DC Sly amp; The Family Stone and the rock group Queen; whimsical -- yet highly stylized -- costumes by Caroline Harris; and an attention span aimed directly at MTV viewers. All of this combines to create a film with a decidedly 21st-century dramatic edge and attitude. Its an edge and an attitude that can get desperate at times. Australian heartthrob-in-training Heath Ledger stars as William a peasant boy who dreams of becoming a knight and of winning jousting tournaments across Europe. However upward mobility was not an option in the 14th century. Knights were born not made and your station in life did not change from cradle to grave. William a servant to a mid-level knight refuses to abide by the status quo. When his master suddenly drops dead just before a tournament William seizes his chance. He pulls on the now ownerless armor and joins the games. Rockin the jousting tournament At this point the movie takes flight as William -- now ""Sir Ulrich"" -- enters the ring. The strains of Freddie Mercury singing ""We Will Rock You"" sets the tone with the prophetic lyrics ""gonna be a big man some day"" and our young hero begins his first battle. The sight of a huge field full of authentic-looking characters from the Middle Ages rocking out to Queens music creates a delightful adrenaline rush as the two combatants charge each other on horseback jousting sticks thrust forward. Writer producer and director Brian Helgeland (who won an Oscar for his ""L.A. Confidential"" screenplay in 1997) pulls out all the stops in this reinvention of an old standard genre. Even though the films main action is one jousting match after another Helgeland shoves enough disparate camera angles swish pans and crunching armor into each match so the audience at least has the illusion of varied action even if they arent really getting it. Of course you also get the feeling youre about to see beer banners in the background at any moment. Ledger is extremely appealing in the leading role (despite the surfer dude blond hair). Hes eminently believable as his character grows to meet each new challenge in his quest to win the hand of his lady love Jocelyn played by newcomer Shannyn Sossamon. He also handles the physicality of the role well but he might want to consider beefing up a bit if he intends to be a full-fledged action hero. In his one shirtless scene he looks like a plucked chicken.

(Columbia Pictures) Theres something irresistible about a knights contest in the middle ages that features a medieval crowd rocking out to Queens ""We Will Rock You."" Hey it could happen. Queens old you know. This obvious anachronism which opens the charming ""A Knights Tale"" clues you into the fun youre about to have. Savvy without being smug cute without being saccharin and funny without slipping into over-the-top goofiness this is a 14th-century good time. On one level you could dismiss it as ""King Arthur"" for video-game slackers but theres something more. The movie -- which has nothing to do with King Arthur or the Knights of the Round Table -- doesnt have a pretentious bone in its body. Its disarming lightheartedness its complete belief in its own conceit could appeal to any audience. (And it indirectly anticipates the anachronistic rock n roll we can look forward to in Baz Luhrmanns upcoming ""Moulin Rouge."") William Thatcher (Heath Ledger Mel Gibsons son in ""The Patriot"") is the squire of a well-known knight who has inconveniently died in the midst of a jousting match. The dead knights only one more ride-and-tilt away from winning his contest. After huddling with his varlet-pals Roland (Mark Addy from ""The Full Monty"") and Wat (Alan Tudyk) William decides to armor-up and play his dead boss for one match. After all William merely has to survive the final round to win the thing. And all three squires can pocket the money and be on their way. Williams a great jouster. And when he does better than merely survive the thrill of a brand new destiny is too hard to shake off. Theres a financial killing to be made in the tournament circuit he tells Roland and Wat. Just invest a few coins into training add a false title to Williams humble beginnings and theyre on the road to riches. Hooking up with a compulsive gambler (Paul Bettany) named uh Geoff Chaucer who can forge a whole family tree and later with a dandy armor-repairing blacksmith (Laura Fraser) they go for the big time. Wills new name by the by is now Ulrich von Lichtenstein of Gelderland. The story which amounts to the age-old jock-life vs. love-life dilemma isnt particularly groundbreaking in its narrative magnificence. Ulrich who starts winning tournaments meets his match in Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell) a haughty knight and tournament hot-dogger. And he falls in love with Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon) a smart slinky damsel who isnt completely sure she wants a guy whos so nuts about lances. Produced written and directed by Brian Helgeland who made ""L.A. Confidential"" this is a movie to completely enjoy and forget in one sitting. Ledgers very appealing as the idealistic hero; he balances matinee presence with deft comic timing. Addy Tudyk and Bettany make a great comic relief trio. (Chaucers pro-wrestling crowd-warming hype as he introduces his knight is pretty funny.) And those amusingly selected rock songs keep coming. Bachman-Turner Overdrive serenades us with ""Takin Care of Business"" as Ulrich and his squires train for the tournaments. And when Ulrich and his low-budget dream team return to London for a tournament Super Bowl the soundtrack pounds to the sound of Thin Lizzys ""The Boys Are Back in Town."" With this much fun and energy theres only one clear option yield dude. A Knights Tale (PG-13 133 minutes) - Contains jousting violence and an implied sexual situation. Area theaters.

The working stiff has taught his boy well that a fellow can upgrade his station in life if hell Just Do It. (As played by Christopher Cazenove Pop speaks with the diction of old-world England but thinks with the optimism of a new-world immigrant American.) Now a young man with the fried platinum hair of a California surfer and the non-threatening photogenic looks of a WB contract player (the personable Australian-born Ledger was ogled by the kids while their parents pondered Mel Gibsons ponytail in The Patriot) William vows to become a knight - the rock-star profession of his time. (For emphasis Queen sings ""gonna be a big man some day"" and the soundtrack wills viewers to be rocked with classic 70s stuff including Bachman-Turner Overdrives ""Takin Care of Business"" and Thin Lizzys ""The Boys Are Back in Town."") The wannabe nobleman brushes up his jousting skills with the help of rotund sensitive sidekick Roland (favorite rotund Full Monty alumnus Mark Addy) and hotheaded sidekick Wat (ginger-haired Alan Tudyk from 28 Days). William christens himself Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein of Gelderland. Then he fibs himself into a royals-only jousting competition with the help of persuasive oratory from Geoff Chaucer (Paul Bettany) - as in the author of The Canterbury Tales - whos great with gab but a lousy debt-ridden gambler. Naturally William faces an enemy a snooty count and terrible sport played by Rufus Sewell. (Sewells snaky black curls and meanie glower contrast in cinematic shorthand with Ledgers blond heroic coloring.) Naturally William falls in love with the same fair lady the count fancies a mysterious beauty named Jocelyn (newcomer Shannyn Sossamon who doesnt so much act as dress up nicely in a striking wardrobe of Japanesey fashion-forward ensembles). And inevitably with such an Olde Chestnut plot A Knights Tale loses energy even as lances fly. (They fly over the course of a full two hours; audiences are exhorted not to drink bowls of wassail beforehand.) Helgeland co-screenwriter of L.A. Confidential and director of Payback may mean A Knights Tale to be fun and accessible for those who think Monty Python and the Holy Grail is too darn hip and loony. But for all the jesting and jousting these are no Python knights who go Ni Ni Ni These are the knights who go feh.
