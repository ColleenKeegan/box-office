Comments (1) Atlantis The Lost Empire The grandson of an Atlantis scholar joins an expedition to locate the remains of the legendary civilization and discovers what he hadnt dared hope--that it still exists. Visually imaginative and even persuasively spiritual this animated adventure has some unusually complex villains and heroes and some of the plot and dialogue transcends whats typical in movies intended for a broad or youthful audience. Instead of joking dismissively about the idea that one cultures study of another can be hard to distinguish from occupation and plunder the characters actually discuss--and their actions acknowledge--the unresolved irony. Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise directed a screenplay by Tab Murphy; with the voices of Michael J. Fox Cree Summer and James Garner. 95 min.

It recycles familiar adventure and cartoon devices with minimal wit and flair and the lack of imagination will seem all the more dramatic to audiences in comparison to the winningly sophisticated ""Shrek."" Disney pushes into all-talking no-singing no-dancing and in the end no-fun animated territory with ""Atlantis The Lost Empire."" This blandly conceived and executed attempt at a juve-style ""Indiana Jones"" with Jules Verne trappings recycles familiar adventure and cartoon devices with minimal wit and flair and the lack of imagination will seem all the more dramatic to audiences in comparison to the winningly sophisticated ""Shrek"" against which ""Atlantis"" doesnt stand a chance at the box office. Rated PG but likely to be avoided by kids over 12 or so and without many elements that will register as cool to younger kids pic stands among the very least of Disneys major non-TV-derived animated features. Disney has long been moving closer to making a full-length cartoon without songs or anthropomorphized animal characters and one can hope that they and others will continue to try. But the approach and style will have to be more striking and creative than they are in this picture which departs from traditional Disney fare mostly through its pallid New Agey concepts and visual motifs that remind by turns of Japanese anime and horror of horrors ""Pokemon."" The enormously successful team of producer Don Hahn and directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (""Beauty and the Beast"" ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"") and screenwriter Tab Murphy (""Hunchback"" ""Tarzan"") revives the myth of Atlantis in a way that makes it smack of ""Pocahontas"" as a threatened paradise whose fate hinges upon the outcome of a romance between a native girl and a sensitive explorer with mercenary companions. It seems to take far longer than necessary to cover the expository basics that set up the journey of the learned but green Milo Thatch (voiced by Michael J. Fox) from his academic womb in Washington D.C. to the under-oceanic world of Atlantis in 1914. The grandson of a legendary adventurer Milo can read the ancient Atlantean language and is given the presumed sole copy of a text and guide to the lost continent by a nutty tycoon willing to finance a trip into the unknown. Better yet he has already built and staffed a lavish submarine (reminiscent of those from ""20000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"") thats ready to go. The seriously multiethnic crew is led by the macho Commander Rourke (James Garner) and includes tough babe Helga (Claudia Christian) French Foreign Legion-type explosives expert Vinny Santorini (Don Novello) black medic Dr. Sweet (Phil Morris) Hispanic engineer Audrey Ramirez (Jacqueline Obradors) extendible lens-eyed geologist Mole (Corey Burton) the chain-smoking Thelma Ritter-ish wisecracker Mrs. Packard (Florence Stanley) and cook Cookie (the late Jim Varney). As the sub approaches the underwater passageway to Atlantis team sets off in lifeboats to escape the clutches of a giant lobster monster that destroys the mother ship and the survivors eventually make their way to their destination a beautiful but somewhat forlorn paradise that resembles a run-down Shangri-La. The ancient king (Leonard Nimoy) would seem to be on his last legs while his daughter and successor the spirited Princess Kida (Cree Summer) worries for her future subjects. ""Our people live but our culture is dying"" she laments to Milo a rangy bespectacled physical bumbler who takes more than an academic interest in the scantily clad maiden from down under. The New Age element comes to the fore when Milo exploring the island with Kida learns the exciting news that Crystal Power provides the energy source for the continent. But it turns out that Rourke knows this too and plans to export the stuff which also has exceptional healing properties back to the mainland for maximum commercial gain. This of course will mean the death of Atlantis all over again leading to a protracted struggle between Rourke and his hired guns on one side and Milo Kida (who gets kidnapped) and their assorted loyalists on the other. End result is an action sequence of some mild excitement as ancient flying-fish craft are resurrected to chase down Rourke but similar scenes in live-action features with the latest CGI work so eclipse this animated variation in terms of visceral impact and thrills that you have to wonder if it was really worth the trouble. Much the same could be said of the film as a whole. Decision to use CinemaScope as Disney previously did in animation on ""Lady and the Tramp"" ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""A Bugs Life"" gives ""Atlantis"" a nice big canvas upon which to play out if only there were some arresting compositions to enliven it. Vocal perfs are fine with Novello getting the edge among the supporting thesps for his marvelously sardonic world-weary delivery. James Newton Howards score is a bit overblown.

However it doesnt ascend to the lofty heights achieved by other Disney classics where the film enchants adults as much as it does children. ""Atlantis"" certainly has a pedigree. It was created by the team of producer Don Hahn and directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise who made ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1991) and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1996). The cast of voices is also terrific including those of Michael J. Fox James Garner Leonard Nimoy David Ogden Stiers John Mahoney the late actor and comedian Jim Varney and veteran voice-over actress Cree Summer. But even with all that ""Atlantis"" never soars.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Atlantis That Sinking Feeling By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 15 2001 Milo finds the lost city and meets Atlantean Kida in ""Atlantis The Lost Empire."" (Walt Disney) If Disneyland were 20000 leagues under the sea it would look a whole lot like ""Atlantis The Lost Empire"" the studios quaintly animated summer feature. With its magic mountains pastel colors and genial Bambi-eyed populace the sunken Shangri-la could easily be mistaken for the remains of ""The Lost Theme Park.""Ironically Disney had hoped to update its image with this mildly diverting adventure yet the picture hasnt really broken away from the tried-and-true format spoofed in the far superior ""Shrek."" But apparently shaking the companys warm and fuzzy tradition isnt so easy.Directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (""Beauty and the Beast"" ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" etc.) have axed what Disney does best calypso crustaceans wisecracking warthogs singing teapots. They even hired a hip comic-book artist (Mike Mignola of ""Hellboy"") to work with studio veterans in a futile even misguided attempt to appeal to preadolescents and teens instead of Mom Pop and the small fry. The result is cutesy but harsh a hybrid of saucer-eyed anime and square-jawed angularity that brings to mind an edgier ""Pokemon."" On top of everything else the filmmakers decided that the picture should also recall the studios live-action films from the 50s and 60s such as ""Swiss Family Robinson."" This means the computer graphics must look as if they were hand-drawn and the film shot in CinemaScope. Put it all together and youve got what the company calls ""Disnola"" a new-fashioned but old-fangled hash.The same goes for the plot which draws on Platos version of the story as well as Edgar Cayces alleged memories from a past life in Atlantis. Plato says the people got uppity and angered Neptune; Cayce suggests they produced unfathomable energy from powerful ""fire-crystals"" which they misused causing the continent to go plop-plop fizz-fizz.Anyway the story centers on Milo Thatch (voiced by Michael J. Fox) an insufferably eager nincompoop who joins an expedition in search of the submerged utopia. Oddly although its 1914 the crew is as inclusive as the Rainbow Coalition a Latina mechanic (Jacqueline Obradors) an African American doctor (Phil Morris) a crusty Euro-American commander (James Garner) a German dominatrix (Claudia Christian) a French geologist (Corey Burton) an Italian explosives expert (Don Novello) plus a chuck wagon-era cook (the late Jim Varney) and a cynical switchboard operator (Florence Stanley).When it comes to stereotypes Disney tries its darnedest but still fails. These characters are an improvement over the hook-nosed evil Arabs of ""Aladdin."" Yes stereotypes exist for a reason but must all Frenchmen stink all Germans wear jackboots and all Latinas recall Rosie Perez?If the screenwriter Tab Murphy in this case is too lazy or unimaginative to provide his characters with distinguishing traits the answer is invariably yes. Alas strong supporting players are even more crucial when the story is less than compelling and the hero this bland. Cree Summer gives voice to Princess Kida the Pocahontas of Atlantis and Milos love interest. The citys crystals are dimming and the civilization is dying. And while they speak all languages its people can no longer read Atlantean. Luckily Milo can and with his help Kida manages to provide a happily-ever-after ending. Hows that for cutting-edge?""Atlantis The Lost Empire"" (95 minutes) is rated PG for action and violence.

Fox) explains his theories about Atlantis to Commander Rourke and his shadowy lieutenant Helga Sinclair. Atlantis is a find / Disney emphasizes adventure over cuteness romance and song 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ATLANTIS THE LOST EMPIRE Animated. Voices by Michael J. Fox Cree Summer James Garner. Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise. (PG. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The villain in the new animated Disney movie ""Atlantis The Lost Empire"" is Commander Rourke a thrill-seeking plunderer who resents his mercenary label. ""Im an adventure capitalist"" he snivels to Milo the plucky young linguist (voiced by Michael J. Fox) who has brought him and his crew many leagues under the sea looking to unearth the title civilization. The rippling authoritative cadences of Rourkes voice belong to James Garner. The kids might not be aware but their parents will know As a hulking cunning bully Garner is playing against type. So is the studio that hired him. At sea level ""Atlantis"" is a Disney ride-or-die cartoon frolic featuring anachronistic speaker-bruising action sequences; cross-cultural boy-girl woo pitch; and a shelfload of cuddly supporting types not the least of whom is the anti-hygienic Peter Lorre-like critter called Mole (Corey Burton). But just beneath the surface ""Atlantis"" brims with adult possibility. The studio appears to be weaning its elementary-school set off the freewheeling irony-swilling potlucks of ""Hercules"" ""The Emperors New Groove"" and the Robin Williams areas of ""Aladdin"" with sheer force of visual panache and keen storytelling. Related Stories Atlantis action packed / Disney film good but not a classic ""Atlantis"" was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise the tag team behind ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" And in a change of pace theyve left the singing and dancing for an inevitable Broadway version. The emphasis here is less on cuteness and romance and more on the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-style adventure. The film opens with an invasion sequence depicting Atlantis ruin that reminds you that Disney does ""Phantom Menace"" better than George Lucas. Later the gorgeous Atlantan princess Kida (Cree Summer) shares a childhood flashback in which the sky goes dark people flee cataclysm approaches and suddenly her memories look as if theyve been produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Kidas city of course was devoured by a tidal wave and hidden from view until Milo et al. find it. For years the good forgotten people of Atlantis -- a population of crypto-Mayan/Afro-Caribbean silver-haired gym-toned polyglots -- have been thriving off a supply of crystals that are the lost empires source of power and medicine. The crystals are also the key to Atlantis legacy the bridge between its day-glo-colored future and its doomed past. Naturally Commander Rourke sees their market potential. Kida brings Milo and the shipwrecked crew to her father and king (Leonard Nimoy). He smells the imperialist tomb-raiding possibilities and asks them to leave. Rourke convinces the king to grant his posse a stay and soon hes got the crystals and is headed up to the surface. The average 6-and-under Disneyphile might have to work overtime what with the subtitles (for a language that sounds like coffeehouse Klingon) the endearingly drab oceanic-safari color palette and lack of gratuitous flourishes. The typical elements are here the distaff heroism of ""Mulan"" the passive- aggressive sexual overtures of ""Tarzan"" the parent-kid melodrama of ""The Lion King"" the songlessness of well thats basically unprecedented. But the tempo doesnt get cranked up to ""theme park"" until the big climax leaving time for disappointed kids to lean over and inquire about why they arent laughing. The temporary answer is that lifes answers arent solved in acutely ironic asides overproduced show tunes and Happy Meal tie-ins. But in the meantime whats a cynical 10-year-old cruising for light carnivalesque winking to do? The ""Atlantis"" reply appears to be ""let them eat Shrek.

Atlantis The Lost Empire Movie Review (2001) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/atlantis-the-lost-empire-2001,200,atlantisthelostempire8,atlantisthelostempire,rogerebert
"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Atlantis Lost at Sea By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 15 2001 Milo finds the lost city and meets Atlantean Kida in ""Atlantis The Lost Empire."" (Walt Disney) Lets start with whats good about ""Atlantis The Lost Empire."" Thats obvious the humor. Thanks to punchy and funny off-screen performances from Michael J. Fox (as the central character Milo Thatch) Don Novello (you know Father Guido Sarducci) the late Jim Varney (Ernest P. Worrell the ""Hey Vern"" guy) and Phil Morris (who played a recurring character on ""Seinfeld"") theres a lot of verbal zest going on behind the movie.And to keep things positive for oh another paragraph I thought this PG-rated animated feature had the makings of a Jules Verne-style matinee adventure as nerdy scholar Milo teams with a tough crew to retrace the fabled city.Unfortunately the humor (much of it aimed at adults) isnt enough to propel us through the slow-moving often listless plot or breathe more than functional life into the characters. Perhaps the watery domain of Atlantis some underwater seacraft and the large lobsterlike creature (the Leviathan) that protects the city will be enough for young eyes. Maybe theyll be amused by Gaetan Moliere (Corey Burton) a geologist who looks like Jean Reno and very much deserves the nickname Mole. But the story will force many of these kids to feel as if theyre treading water.Milo is a museum cartographer determined to follow in his late explorer-grandfathers footsteps in search of the mythic Atlantis. Joining forces with Commander Rourke (voice of James Garner) and a group of mercenary explorers he finds himself traveling under the sea near the coast of Iceland.Before you can go ""aah-aah-aah"" like Ariel the team has found a busy hoppin Atlantis and Milo has gone flippers for a curvaceous Atlantean named Kida (Cree Summer). Milo and Kida who happens to be the kings daughter eventually join forces to stop Commander Rourke from stealing Atlantiss super secret a positive energy force that could change the world.While this story goes on (and on) we cling like drowning victims to the rare moments of humor. As Vincenzo ""Vinny"" Santorini an explosives expert who dreams of starting a flower shop Novellos definitely the funniest of the lot. And its nice that Varney bids us farewell with such an amusing role - as ""Cookie"" an old sea dog whose cooking is atrocious.But for the most part the movies a bland disappointment on many levels. Watching ""Atlantis"" which is supposed to be graced with ""eye-popping wide-screen animation"" (according to Disney) I found myself thinking are these the rough draft drawings for the final print? When will they fill in the rest? I had the same reaction watching ""Hercules"" a poorly designed ineptly illustrated Disney spectacle. Both movies seem to avoid detail in the figure drawings a sort of short-cut animation that looks cheap fast and economic. Even though this movie will undoubtedly make money (if not theatrically definitely through its video release) youd think the folks at Disney would have pride enough to draw better.""Atlantis The Lost Empire"" (PG 96 minutes) - Contains some action violence and story details and humor that might need explanation for kids.

Fox James Garner Leonard Nimoy Directors Kirk Wise Gary Trousdale Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating PG for action violence The Little Mermaid may have been the whale of a fairy tale that allowed Disney to restore the glory to its animation reputation back in 1989. But as a toon template it smells like yesterdays halibut. It stands to reason that the studio would reinvent its trademark genre yet again. The makers of Atlantis The Lost Empire plunge back into Mermaids aquatic setting but with a leaner meaner game plan. Banished are the Broadway show tunes and the calypso crabs. Instead theyve ripped a page from Disneys old live-action yarns. Think 20000 Leagues Under the Sea re-imagined as a PG comic-book thriller with guns a-blasting vehicles a-zooming and crazed mercenaries a-pillaging. Read more Photo Gallery Journey to Atlantis Video Atlantis trailer Stories Review Atlantis visuals thrill emotion sinks Disney domain is under seige Disney milestone sweet for actor animator Fox stays animated despite health But what Atlantis gains in chills and thrills it loses in pure emotion. The visuals are a stunning widescreen mix of digital and hand-drawn artwork that is far more edgy and angular than typical Mouse fare. The giant waves monster crustaceans flame-throwing fireflies and rivers of lava arrive in a furious rush. Its a Saturday-morning cartoon pumped up on steroids. But for a story about finding the heart -- or in the scripts new-age parlance ""life force"" -- of a legendary continent Atlantis sadly misplaces its own heart. Most of the girl-friendly bait is gone (there is still a curvy princess whose thick mane swirls in the water) replaced by a boys-will-be-boys sensibility with plenty of loud toys. In this tale set in 1914 our hero is a scholarly young man named Milo (voiced by Michael J. Fox) a Wheres Waldo-ish linguist who inherits a journal that explains the mystery of the underwater empire. Its written in Atlantean which Milo can handily translate. Recruited for an expedition to find Atlantis thats funded by an eccentric millionaire he joins an elite team led by Commander Rourke (James Garner) a burly brute of a G.I. Joe and his hench-babe Helga (Babylon 5s throaty Claudia Christian as a chip off the old Sharon Stone). The rest of the hand-picked crew is a diverse if disappointingly stereotypical dirty half-dozen including an Italian explosives specialist (Don Novello aka Father Guido Sarducci) a Latina mechanic (Jacqueline Obradors) with a Rosie Perez attitude and a droning crone of a chain-smoking communications officer (Florence Stanley). Most peculiar is Mole (Corey Burton) a filthy French pervert who digs digging. But the motley lot fails to make a lasting impression. Despite triple-digit fatalities (most unseen) and a few bumps our adventurers locate Atlantis rather easily. Harder is figuring out why the culture is dying and why the crystal-wearing people led by an ancient monarch (a sonorous Leonard Nimoy) can speak nearly any language but can no longer read their own. Much time is given to Milo growing closer to Kida (Cree Summer) the aforementioned princess who despite nubile appearances is way too old for him -- several thousand years too old. Once the secrets of the civilization are unlocked and the missions true nefarious purpose is revealed a full-out battle follows complete with over-the-top sci-fi effects. While no disaster as it purges musty formulas Atlantis remains lost as it vaporizes from memory.

"Atlantis | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; atlantis ) Atlantis (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli What would summer be without a new animated spectacle from Walt Disney Pictures? In recent years the arrival of warm weather in the Northern Hemisphere has augured the coming of the latest feature-length animated saga from the mega-corporation that holds Mickey Mouse and Regis Philbin in its back pocket. Yet even though Atlantis The Lost Empire has captured the traditional Disney summer slot its a non-traditional movie at least by Disney standards. Gone are the songs the cuddly animals and the cute comical sidekicks. In their place is a relatively straightforward adventure story that owes as much to anime as it does to Jules Verne and the Indiana Jones movies. (Someone even compared this to Die Hard although I fail to see the connection.) Its ironic to note that in a summer thats shaping up to feature one live-action dud after another two of the best sources of entertainment have been in the animated arena Atlantis and Dreamworks Shrek. Of course as computer-generated special effects become increasingly important to live action films the more blurred the line between ""live action"" and ""animated"" becomes. Then there are films like Final Fantasy which seem determined to obliterate that line altogether. How much longer I wonder before all science fiction/fantasy/adventure movies are predominantly animated? Atlantis is from veteran Disney directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise whose previous credits include Beauty and the Beast (which is about to undergo an IMAX re-release next year with seven minutes of additional footage) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The vocal talents represent a large cross-section of Hollywood including Michael J. Fox James Garner John Mahoney Leonard Nimoy and in an indication of how long it takes to produce one of these animated films the late Jim Varney. Then theres David Ogden Steirs who is making a record-setting fourth appearance in a Disney animated picture (and that doesnt include his participation in three direct-to-video sequels). The story is simple enough. Nerdy Milo Thatch (voice of Michael J. Fox) is chosen to participate in an early 20th century expedition in search of the lost city of Atlantis. Milo a linguist by trade (or as some call him an ""expert in gibberish"") has earned that honor because his grandfather was the explorer who retrieved the journal that tells of the citys location. Milo is part of a party that includes a wisecracking cook Cookie (Jim Varney); a bubbly teenage mechanic Audrey (Jacqueline Obradors); an explosives authority Vinny (Don Novello) a burly doctor Sweet (Phil Morris); and The Mole (Corey Burton) an expert on digging. The group is led by the no-nonsense Commander Rourke (James Garner) and his equally humorless second-in-charge Helga (Claudia Christian). After taking a submarine under water battling a giant sea monster and falling into the bowels of a dormant volcano the group encounters the Atlantians led by the pretty Princess Kida (Cree Summer) and her wary father King Nedakh (Leonard Nimoy). Soon Rourkes real objective in finding the city becomes apparent. Hes not there for the ""discovery teamwork and adventure"" that drives Milo. His motive is purely mercenary - he sees dollar signs if he can bring back Atlantis mysterious source of power. And the rest of the group is with him - at least to start with. Atlantis contains less dialogue than some of the recent Disney animated features replacing the songs and talking with some genuinely thrilling action sequences. There are submarine chase sequences aerial dogfights and a variety of daring escapes and near-escapes that feature all manner of pyrotechnics. Trousdale and Wise employ some bold camerawork creating the animated equivalent of impressive tracking shots. There are also numerous panoramic sequences that involve a moving rotating camera. The look of the characters is more angular than usual (although not as angular as in Hercules) giving the film a non-traditional appearance. And James Newton Howard provides a ""standard"" action/adventure score complete with all the expected heroic cues that is much different from the pop-saturated soundtracks which characterized nearly every Disney animated release during the 1990s. In terms of wit and character empathy Atlantis is a notch below other recent Disney offerings but to a degree the level of adventure spectacle compensates. Milo is a likable enough guy but in many ways the presence of so many supporting characters dilutes both his importance and his chance at development. His character arc is stunted. As a love interest Princess Kida has potential (and provides some animated sex appeal when she strips down to a bikini) but she isnt given much screen time. Those are primarily minor gripes however. On the whole Atlantis offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live-action movies they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division.
