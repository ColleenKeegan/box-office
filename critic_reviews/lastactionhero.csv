This  80 million-plus mishmash of fantasy industry in-jokes self-referential parody film-buff gags and too-big action set-pieces will test the clout of a humongous superstar-driven marketing campaign to put over a picture people wont much like  with the possible exception of early-teen boys. After the big opening word-of-mouth will likely send B.O. down on a steeper-than-desired slide. In a PG-13 picture that represents Arnold Schwarzeneggers self-proclaimed attempt to soften his image and reduce the violence in his work the body count and sadism quotient remain remarkably high. But far more staggering is the total imbalance between the amount of money and effort lavished on every scene and the utter lack of emotion or human interest to latch onto. One of the screenplays more creative aspects is having found several different ways to write the pictures epitaph. Schwarzenegger plays the indestructible screen superhero Jack Slater and at one point his young charge tells him ""You cant die until the grosses go down"" (a remark repeated by the star himself at the end and likely to be quoted frequently). Schwarzenegger also says in exasperation ""This hero stuff has its limits"" but his prophetic signature phrase to his enemies when they try to harm him is ""Big mistake."" Thats what hes made here. It may have been alluring to the star to give his persona a little tweaking by essentially playing himself and the appeal of an 11-year-old boy joining in his he-man exploits can also be understood. But the central problem is that the picture is based on a gimmick rather than a story so the viewer is basically presented with a succession of exceedingly arbitrary scenes in which nothing is at stake because in context its almost all ""fiction"" anyway. In a massive opening scene police sergeant Slater bullies his way past his superiors during a nocturnal hostage standoff to confront the lunatic whos holding Slaters own son along with some other kids. Slater manages to save the day of course although a later flashback reveals that Slater has reason to feel haunted by what occurred on the roof. Watching this action in a rundown Times Square movie palace is little Danny Madigan (Austin OBrien) whose old projectionist friend Nick (Robert Prosky) invites him to return at midnight for a private screening of Slaters latest picture simply titled ""Jack Slater IV."" Before showing it however Nick presents Danny with a golden magic ticket a ""passport to another world"" handed down from Houdini but never used by the retiring Nick. Its with this ticket then that Danny passes into the world onscreen plunked right down in the 1966 Pontiac convertible in which Slater is being pursued by some machine gun-toting baddies. Because of what hes already seen of the film in progress Danny is able to lead Slater to the home of the chief mobster (Anthony Quinn) and his sinister triggerman Benedict (Charles Dance) yet another viciously cruel British villain. This confrontation leads to one shoot-out after another each more elaborate and tiresome than the last interrupted only by visits to the gargantuan futuristic police station (actually the lobby of the former MGM Filmland building now taken over by Sony) where Slaters boss (Frank McRae) can shout at him for his unorthodox methods. This being a ""movie"" much is made of the fantasy element of what goes on in this fictional world Slater can survive all manner of firepower without injury cars are capable of impossible stunts and all the women are hot babes. At one point Slater and Danny enter a video store (heavily stocked with Columbia and TriStar product) only to encounter a display for ""Terminator 2"" starring Sylvester Stallone. Sad to say this represents the virtual high water of the films wit. Much more attention has been paid to the great variety of weapons on display from the vast assortment of late model artillery to the self-assembled flying ax wielded by the rooftop fiend. At a crucial juncture the crafty Benedict comes into possession of the magic ticket and takes his evil ways into the ""real"" world of Times Square only to be followed by Danny and Slater who is dismayed to discover that violence can actually hurt and that his entire life has been lived in movies. It just so happens that ""Jack Slater IV"" is opening in New York which allows for the ""real"" Arnold Schwarzenegger plugging Planet Hollywood accompanied by Maria Shriver and surrounded by a host of celebs in cameos to be threatened at his own movie premiere and saved by his fictional counterpart. Further climaxes involve a rooftop confrontation in the rain that instantly recalls ""Blade Runner"" and mostly weirdly the emergence of hooded Death off the screen from ""The Seventh Seal"" (in the person of Ian McKellen) to stalk Slater and the kid. The basic conceit of a ""real"" character joining ""fictional"" characters up onscreen was possibly done first and certainly best by Buster Keaton in his brilliant 1924 comedy ""Sherlock Jr."" The fanciful script here contributed to by several uncredited hands including William Goldman certainly leaves a lot to be desired and director John McTiernan nowhere displays the deft whimsical touch required to pull this off. To the contrary its all heavy empty and exceptionally noisy. There are too many guns too many cars too many explosions too many extras too many villains (at least four prominent ones) and no heart. Almost everything about the film has annoying aspects beginning with the heavy metal score which is uniquely strident off-putting and headache-inducing. Many of the settings look murky and unattractive and the lensing of them lacks the sort of muscular grace that best suits ambitious actioners. Many of the visual effects were no doubt challenging to achieve but without an involving dramatic context they seem like exercises in a vacuum. On a character level Arnold is Arnold and theres not really much else to be said about his performance here. Everyone else seems to have checked in for a nice payday. Unfortunately Austin OBrien who is onscreen most of the time is far from being a charming or endearing kid. Jabbering incessantly and always badgering his hero he delivers a one-note performance that adds considerably to the already deafening decibel levels of the soundtrack and is best characterized as a perpetual insistence upon being heard and noticed. ""Last Action Hero"" is enough to make one nostalgic for ""Hudson Hawk."" Last Action Hero(Action fantasy -- Color) ProductionA Columbia release of a Steve Roth/Oak production.

Thats if youre dying to find out what a two-hour ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch might look like given reportedly a 60 million budget some of Hollywoods best special-effects people and an Arnold Schwarzenegger who wants desperately to please. ""Last Action Hero"" was written by four writers and directed by John McTiernan but the auteur of it all is Mr. Schwarzenegger. Its his aggressively self-assured personality that shapes it. He may not have thought it up designed the sets or photographed it but he certainly approved of everything that went into it. That would include its basic premise suggested by if not actually stolen from ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" a generic 11-year-old boy named Danny (Austin OBrien) sits entranced in a New York theater watching for the 37th time a movie with his favorite screen character the Los Angeles police detective Jack Slater played by Mr. Schwarzenegger as Arnold Schwarzenegger. For reasons that need not be explained (though they are and at too great a length) Danny suddenly finds himself inside the movie as Jacks pint-sized partner. For a while Danny enjoys the make-believe as he tries to warn Jack about forthcoming plot twists and shares the detectives manic car chases shootouts and last-minute evasions of death. ""Im a comedy sidekick"" Danny tells himself. ""I cant get hurt."" That abruptly changes when both Danny and Slater are tossed out of the film into the real world of Manhattan which is scarcely less violent than the movie-withins fictional Los Angeles. Its also a place where fictional characters like Slater can wind up as dead as real people like Danny. ""Last Action Hero"" is something of a mess but a frequently enjoyable one. It tries to be too many things to too many different kinds of audiences the result being that it will probably confuse and perhaps even alienate the hard-core action fans who transformed ""Terminator 2"" into a box-office phenomenon. More sophisticated audiences are likely never to see the films occasionally funny gags at the expense of movies the action fans have never heard of. Its to Mr. Schwarzeneggers credit that ""Last Action Hero"" is the riskiest film he has ever made. If it succeeds at the box office he may well run for public office. Icons of his stature get easily restless. In such films as ""Twins"" and ""Kindergarten Cop"" Mr. Schwarzenegger demonstrated that unlike Sylvester Stallone he could play it for laughs and not send audiences screaming from the theaters. Yet there is a terrible esthetic muddle at the heart of ""Last Action Hero"" which Mr. Schwarzenegger has described as an action film for the 1990s. The movie has a kind of gross charm in the way it portrays Jack Slaters fictional world in the movie-within. The Los Angeles police headquarters are as glitzy and as filled with exotic plants as the atrium of some just-opened Las Vegas casino hotel. There is even an animated cat on the premises. The set is funny even though no legitimate Schwarzenegger movie was ever so far off the mark. What is being parodied? I would also suspect that Mr. Schwarzeneggers most faithful fans wont find the film-withins car chases shootouts and exploding houses especially gripping since nothing is at stake. Yet they look so much like the effects in conventional ""Die Hard"" and ""Robo Cop"" movies that other audiences may be put off by even the simulated violence. ""Last Action Hero"" is alternately too clunky and too clever. It takes far too long to set up the original gimmick of the little boys entrance into the film-within. When the situation is reversed and Slater enters the supposed real world you may cringe at lines that rework Woody Allens better ones in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" Says someone to Slater at this point ""Ive never met a fictional character before."" At the same time there is the occasional movie gag that delights Danny sits in his classroom listening to his teacher drone on about ""Hamlet."" The teacher played by Joan Plowright the widow of Laurence Olivier then shows the class Oliviers version in which in Dannys eyes Slater takes over for Olivier in the title role. This clip shot in silvery black-and-white with only a fireball seen in bright orange is possibly the films best special effect. ""Last Action Hero"" otherwise looks as if it had been made in too great a hurry. Its full of scenes and characters that lead nowhere. Its also the kind of movie in which a number of stars show up playing roles that though identified as ""featured"" are no bigger really than those of the stars who play cameos. The cast includes F. Murray Abraham Art Carney Charles Dance Mercedes Ruehl Anthony Quinn Sharon Stone Little Richard Jean-Claude Van Damme Tina Turner and Ian McKellan (who appears as Death from Ingmar Bergmans ""Seventh Seal"" lost in present-day Manhattan). Toward the end of the film Mr. Schwarzenegger appears as himself attending the New York opening of his latest Jack Slater film accompanied by his wife Maria Shriver and blithely unaware that Jack Slater is fighting for his life in another part of the theater. Instead Mr. Schwarzenegger is seen hustling the Jack Slater merchandise that like the ""Last Action Hero"" T-shirts caps and poster are being sold to promote the movie. Pirandello was never both this complicated and commonplace. With his lantern jaw and square-cut comic-book looks Mr. Schwarzenegger handles his various roles with good humor its fun being the boss. Young Mr. OBrien is also a very slick performer. Note should be made of the contributions of Dean Semler the director of photography; Eugenio Zanetti the production designer and Richard Greenberg the visual effects consultant. ""Last Action Hero"" has been rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a lot of violence not all of it clearly simulated and scenes in which children are shown to be in real jeopardy.

"Last Action Hero | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; last-action-hero ) Last Action Hero (United States 1993) A movie review by James Berardinelli Danny (Austin OBrien) is addicted to Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger) movies. Hes seen the third one six times and now hes eagerly awaiting the released of Jack Slater IV. When his elderly friend Nick (Robert Prosky) the projectionist at a run-down theater tells Danny that he can sneak him in for an advance screening of the new flick the kid is aquiver with anticipation. The next day when he arrives at the appointed hour (midnight when all strange things happen) Nick lets him in and presents him with a ""magic"" ticket. Theres a long story that goes with this the gist of which is that the ticket purportedly has the ability to transport its user to other worlds but it has a ""mind of its own"". Soon after Danny sits down to enjoy the movie he discovers exactly what Nick meant by that phrase. The seat in the safe comfort of the theater suddenly becomes the floor of Jack Slaters car. Danny is no longer watching the movie -- hes in it. Admittedly this is not a good action film. Given its billing director and title thats a surprise. On the other hand Last Action Hero works as an unexpectedly witty comedy. In fact I found this movie to be more amusing (not to mention more watchable) than Schwarzeneggers two openly-billed comic entries Twins and Kindergarten Cop. The humor ranges from the staple of the action genre -- bad puns -- to some pretty incisive satire. Its possible to find similarities between Last Action Hero and (believe it or not) Robert Altmans The Player. No this isnt nearly as nasty or intelligent a picture as the Spring 1992 release but both movies have a lot of fun blasting Hollywood genre films. Arnolds production may be more good-natured about it (after all hes made his name and most of his fortune out of that kind of popcorn-and-soda movies) but theres no mistaking the intent. Theres hardly a plot device of the action film that goes without some kind of dig. The car chase the shoot-out the exploding vehicles and houses the death-defying jumps the triumph over impossible odds the last-second escape -- all of these and more are mercilessly lampooned in Last Action Hero. On the other hand there is fundamental problem in the movie. The action sequences which are numerous are not exciting. Sure theyre directed with flair and energy but the certain knowledge that nothing remotely bad is going to happen to Arnold or his pint-sized sidekick takes away any possible suspense. McTiernan has given us a lot of flashes and bangs but aside from the laughs generated by the parodies there isnt much for us to sink our teeth into. The pulse-pounding sizzling pull of a Die Hard is absent. Plot problems abound but at least the story is more coherent than Cliffhanger. Since its a fantasy a great deal (such as the horrible plot device of the ticket) can be forgiven although there are several instances where Last Action Hero violates its own terms for inner consistency. Some of the things that go on in Jack Slater IV a live-action cartoon are enjoyable. Theres an incredibly over-the-top car chase (with cars flying off bridges and landing safely far below) thats a lot of fun. However before the setting switches to the ""real world"" the pacing becomes sluggish. Once the freshness of the satire has worn off everything becomes routine. Back in New York things get revitalized for a while. We get to see Arnold play himself as something of a shallow media hog who is pushed around by his wife (Maria Shriver playing herself). Its to Schwarzeneggers credit that he doesnt shrink away from self-mockery. In fact given the opportunity he launches whole-heartedly into it. The ending of Last Action Hero is pathetic. By the last fifteen minutes the uniqueness and fun have all drained away and theres nothing in the climax to liven things up. Perhaps if the villains (a one-eyed sharpshooter named Benedict played by Charles Dance and a homicidal lunatic called only ""The Slasher"" played by Tom Noonan) had been more charismatic the usual end-of-the-film heroics would have been enjoyable but these are not the kind of bad guys that the audience can really enjoy hating. This is especially disappointing since McTiernan directed Alan Rickmans standout performance as the slick-tongued despicable nasty in Die Hard. Theres also an interesting plot thread thats not developed at all. Using the magic ticket its possible to bring any screen character to life in the real world. Imagine what the film could have been like with Draculas Terminators and all sorts of other unworldly creatures roaming around. Alas the device is hardly used. Cameos abound. The likes of James Belushi Sharon Stone Hammer and Jean-Claude Van Damme make appearances. There are also countless references and homages to movies both old and new. The best wedding of a tribute with a cameo involves Joan Plowright the widow of the late Laurence Olivier. As a school-teacher introducing her class to a clip from Oliviers Hamlet the eminent British actress tells the students that they might recognize Olivier from Clash of the Titans. Also notable is Schwarzeneggers portrayal of a gun-toting Hamlet. Theres also a running gag involving the line ""Ill be back."" Last Action Hero is sporadically entertaining but it could have been a whole lot more. Trimmed down and better edited this film might have been a top-notch satire.

"Last Action Hero (PG-13) Last Action Hero (PG-13) By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer June 18 1993 If theres one thing going for ""Last Action Hero"" (not counting Arnold Schwarzenegger of course) its the construction of it all. Even if this intermixing of kid fantasy (meet PG-13 hero Austin OBrien) and adult shootem-up Hollywood insider jokes and cheap Arnold puns doesnt completely bowl you over its clever and intriguing. At least mostly. This Other Big Summer Movie this rival to ""Jurassic Park"" is not seamless. Structurally it can be a little haphazard and messy. The humor sometimes hits sometimes misses. Itll depend on what mood the audience is in. A 730 crowd could roll in the aisles over this; but the 945 folks might sit through this stunned. Its that kind of movie. But if ""Action Hero"" has its dead spots it can also be funny -- very funny. Take Arnold playing Hamlet . . . . But first the story. Eleven-year-old Danny (OBrien) has only one respite from dangerous New York City life and school To watch his favorite movie hero Jack Slater. Thanks to friendly old projectionist Nick (Robert Prosky) he can slip into the theater day or night to watch Slater in celluloid action. Slater (played by Maria Shrivers muscular Austrian sidekick) is an L. A. cop who chews a mean cigar walks unharmed through gunfire and always gets his man. Naturally he does this with enormous infrastructural damage vehicular destruction stunt heroics and gratuitous loss of life. His screen life is a swaggering fictional blast. And watching alone in the theater Danny drinks it all in. Things get interesting when projectionist Nick gives Danny a magic movie ticket -- given to him years ago by Harry Houdini. The old man who has never dared use it finally tears it in half and hands the stub to Danny. Clutching the ticket Danny finds himself transported into Slaters world. In the midst of a frenetic car chase Slater is shocked to find an 11-year-old sitting in the back of his car. First its Dannys turn to be in Slaters world. A veteran of Slaters movies he knows every cliche every heroic one-liner and all of Slaters history. A hero-and-the-kid story develops as Danny helps Slater contend with his latest villains (played by Anthony Quinn and Charles Dance). But all hell breaks loose when Benedict (Dance) gets hold of the magic ticket and enters Dannys world. Now Danny brings Slater into the real world and the movie hero discovers it really hurts when you punch through glass. At this point director John ""Die Hard"" McTiernan and his team of scriptwriters (a conspiracy of four collectively responsible for ""Lethal Weapon"" ""The Last Boy Scout"" and ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"") have their multidimensional work cut out for them. Whether these convolutions are too involved for summer audiences remains to be seen. But story momentum is often lost. The drama doesnt keep you gripped the way ""Terminator II Judgment Day"" did -- or that far superior dimension-fusion fantasy ""Back to the Future."" ""Action Hero"" with multiple cameos from Sharon Stone Hammer Jean-Claude Van Damme and a myriad others has a quorum of good moments -- and more than enough of Arnold -- to satisfy the crowd. As for those smart-alecky lines they come at you like frenzied bullets hoping desperately to connect. Some are better than others. ""Could I speak to the drug dealer of the house?"" asks Slater sweetly when villain Dance opens his mansion door. Danny also has an amusing daydream at the beginning when he pictures Slater as Hamlet in an action-movie version of the play ""Somethings rotten in the State of Denmark"" says the announcer in the imaginary movie trailer. ""And Hamlet is taking out the trash"" Perhaps that was the movie Arnold should have done.

"Last Action Hero (PG-13) Last Action Hero (PG-13) By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer June 18 1993 ""Last Action Hero"" certainly feels like the last of something. A self-conscious parody of action movie formulas -- and of the image of its star Arnold Schwarzenegger -- the movie has a note of finality about it. Its a long ironic ostensibly witty farewell at least for now to all that ""Terminator"" stuff a goodbye to Dirty Harry and the ""Lethal Weapon"" guys and all the antiheroic cops and all the jokey gunplay and glib soulless killing. It also feels like a farewell of sorts to Arnold. Or at least to the action hero Arnold. Theres a curious incident near the end of this clumsy reality-fantasy game which toggles back and forth between the world in front of the movie screen and the one inside it. It occurs at the ""real-world"" premiere of ""Jack Slater IV"" the latest in a series of blockbuster action-adventures featuring an inner-city Indiana Jones character played by the world-famous mega-movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Naturally the gregarious media personality -- along with his lovely wife Maria and a passel of other stars -- is in attendance. But so are a handful of uninvited guests among them a savage ax murderer named Ripper (Tom Noonan) who has been sent to assassinate Arnold. Except that at the last instant the actor is saved rescued from this mad killer by none other than ... himself -- or rather himself as Jack Slater who has come across from the fantasy world of the movies into the real world. Obviously theres more to it than this. But first in the fateful moment when the ""fictional"" Arnold and the ""real"" Arnold come face to face the ""faux"" Schwarzenegger asks his real-world counterpart to can the chatter. He doesnt like this actor jerk one bit and he tells him so adding as a parting shot ""Youve caused me nothing but pain."" This isnt quite what we expected but then a lot of ""Last Action Hero"" is rather curious and at least at first pleasingly out of the blue. The key to the story -- and its weakest link -- is a magic movie ticket given to a young boy named Austin by the projectionist (Robert Prosky) at an old Times Square movie house. An only child who takes refuge from the rough squalor of his life with his waitress mother (Mercedes Ruehl) by losing himself in the movies Austin is Slaters biggest fan and when the old man invites him to a private screening of the latest of the Slater slaughter-epics he jumps at the chance. Soon after the picture begins though the magic ticket does its work and Austin is transported ""inside"" the movie hes watching -- right smack into the back seat of the heros speeding convertible. In the unreal alternate dimension of ""Jack Slater IV"" everything is as expected. (Its probably the movie most fans will wish they were watching.) Theres Jacks blustering loudmouthed superior down at the station house and the usual buddy cop horseplay. All this is very confusing for Austin who cant seem to convince Slater that he is a merely a character in a movie. Slater doesnt like the idea of being ""fictional."" But later the ticket comes into play again and Jack and Austin follow the movies symbol of evil incarnate a suave glass-eyed killer named Benedict (Charles Dance) across the threshold into the real world. And now stuck in a reality where he has limitations (he has to reload his gun for example and his hand hurts when he rams it through a window) he starts to see the advantages of being imaginary. Its during these ""reality"" scenes that Arnold is funniest and best suited to his role. And who better to debunk Arnold than Arnold himself? Hasnt that always been his saving grace -- that disarming ability not to take himself or his stardom too seriously? Conceptually the setup is perfect. It can make use of all the old cliches and have loads of action and killing (though thankfully less scarlet) and get away with it because its a spoof a knowing sophisticated satire. The thinking-persons Schwarzenegger movie and the stars most personal most introspective film. His postmodern ""Hamlet."" But thats just on paper. In reality there are serious problems. As it turns out both movies in this summers face-off for box office Valhalla are about dinosaurs. Except that in ""Last Action Hero"" the creature that seems headed for extinction is the hero. By now all you can do with these formulas is what director John McTiernan (and screenwriters Shane Black and David Arnott) have done -- poke fun at them and play them as comedy. This is far from new especially in Schwarzeneggers case. Arnold has always been a cartoon. And so Jack Slater invincible in his snakeskin boots T-shirt and bluejeans is a cartoon played by a cartoon a parody of what was already self-parodic to begin with. The other problem is who wants an ironic summer blockbuster? McTiernan is a first-rate (though not inspired) action director. But because the action is intended to be tongue-in-cheek -- Pirandello by way of Buster Keatons ""Sherlock Jr."" and Woody Allens ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" -- the filmmakers take a step back from the action and dont apply the usual hard sell to churn it up. As a result ""Last Action Hero"" isnt much fun as an action picture or as a satire. Somehow in trying to be both it succeeds at neither. The movie isnt mindless; it just has a mind thats a bit junky and muddled. And to their credit Arnold and his collaborators (the star is the executive producer) havent played it safe. ""Last Action Hero"" is a stretch. Unfortunately its a stretch that proves the star wasnt that elastic to begin with.

Murray Abraham Noah Emmerich Ian McKellen Robert Prosky Anthony Quinn Mercedes Ruehl Tina Turner; Director John McTiernan; Author David Arnott Shane Black; Runtime (in minutes) 130; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted July 9 1993 -- 1200 AM EDT Noisy and hurtling and chaotic as it is LAST ACTION HERO doesnt slide off the rails for about 45 minutes. Early on Danny Madigan (Austin OBrien) a mop-topped 11-year-old action-film fanatic is seated in a grimy Times Square movie palace watching his favorite hero the brawny Los Angeles police sergeant Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger) when hes suddenly propelled into the movie. Weve seen this gimmick before of course (in Buster Keatons Sherlock Jr. and Woody Allens The Purple Rose of Cairo) and theres no reason to think it couldnt work with Arnold. For a few minutes it does. Transported to the back of Slaters speeding vehicle Danny finds himself in the middle of a wildly hyperbolic chase scene. The action is so fast and exaggerated-cars flying with such cartoonish abandon explosions so explosive- that we seem to be in for a high-trash good time. But then a strange phenomenon sets in. Since Danny worships Slater youd think hed be thrilled to find himself in the middle of one of his movies. Instead the kid grows a bit disgruntled. Rather than going with the fantasy he starts trying to prove to Slater that Slater is just a movie character. This twist has a peculiar - and deadening - effect Instead of experiencing what its like to be inside a Hollywood action movie were placed even further outside it. Last Action Hero is a perverse spectacle a stupid generic slab of action bombast that keeps reminding us its a stupid generic slab of action bombast. Its a lead balloon of a movie so top-heavy with self-referential cuteness that it never begins to levitate - or even make sense - as a fantasy. When Danny leads Slater into a Blockbuster Video store to show him a shelf full of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies you can practically hear the audience let out a collective ""Huh?"" After all we knew Arnold was goofing on his image as a world-famous action star but that didnt necessarily mean he was playing ""Arnold Schwarzenegger."" By the time Arnold (I mean Jack) shows up at the New York premiere of his latest movie and says to the real Arnold ""I dont really like you-youve given me nothing but pain"" (is this Schwarzeneggers way of telling us its lonely at the top?) Last Action Hero has deconstructed itself to the point of insanity. The Jack Slater film is intentionally garish nonsense - car crashes and shootouts and a villain (Charles Dance) distinguished only by his collection of gleaming false eyes. Theres a deep cynicism at work in making the film-within-a-film such a deliberate piece of junk. On some level the creators of Last Action Hero are saying ""Of course this is just packaged mindlessness - thats all you dunderheads really want."" Like Hudson Hawk Last Action Hero makes such a strenuous show of winking at the audience (and itself) that it seems to be celebrating nothing so much as its own awfulness. In a sense the movies incipient commercial failure completes it aesthetically. For even if the filmmakers dont go broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public you cant say they didnt try.
