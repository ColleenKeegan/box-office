More about One Direction This Is Us >> And thats the reason One Direction This Is Us a splashy feature-length video valentine to the British boy band plays so smashingly the easy charm and unflagging affability of Harry Styles Niall Horan Zayn Malik Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne. The cameras of director Morgan Spurlock follow every waking moment of the boys lives - from the dizzy whirl of their endless world tour to brief visits to their hometowns where Harry stops by a bakery where he used to work and Louis walks the aisles of a Toys R Us at which he once toiled. Of course now every store at the mall has a whole section devoted to 1D merchandise because this is the band that makes the girls SCREAM. At the moment. And This Is Us captures that hormonal mania vividly. Its the first concert film that has as much footage of the audience as it does of the band. Whether in New York Mexico City or Tokyo the fans are an indispensable part of the 1D phenomenon. Neither the groups songs nor their rather nonchalant stage presence can explain the adulation they provoke. The fact is that they are as criminally cute as a basketful of puppies. This Is Us manages to frame that boyish appeal astutely roping in home movies family photos and archival footage (although in this case archival means anything from last year). The band is made up of former contestants from the British version of The X Factor brought together by the talent shows creator Simon Cowell. And the anything-but-modest impresario takes lots of the credit and grabs lots of facetime in the film. Above all this is a masterpiece of editing. It uses all the standard elements of pop star tributes but assembles them really smartly and energetically. If This Is Us has a problem its that it goes on a little too long and Spurlock has trouble finding his conclusion. But if youre a fan you dont ever want it to end. This is a cinematic all-you-can eat sundae. The film will inspire a nasty sense of jealousy in older viewers resentful that New Kids on the Block N Sync and the like didnt have this sort of mirrored luxury vehicle available to them. One Direction This Is Us  (out of 4 stars) Directed by Morgan Spurlock. With Harry Styles Niall Horan   Zayn Malik Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson. Distributed by TriStar Pictures.

"Review One Direction This Is Us feels anonymous - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review One Direction This Is Us feels anonymous One Direction review Christie Goodwin Niall Horan left Zayn Malik Harry Styles Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinsonin in ""One Direction This Is Us."" Niall Horan left Zayn Malik Harry Styles Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinsonin in ""One Direction This Is Us."" (Christie Goodwin) Mark Olsen The musical group known as One Direction inspires feelings intense feelings. Just in the last week alone the band has been applauded and booed honored put down and defended. All of which seems about right for a group that has ridden to fame as a byproduct of the hard-edged all-or-nothing interactions of the social-media age. The new documentary ""One Direction This Is Us"" is not the raw confessional that title might imply but rather both a primer and new product presentation.The Brit sensations pride themselves on being as one member calls them ""a cool boy band"" mocking choreographed dance moves and playing a rock-oriented pop over the more typical boy band pop-flavored Ramp;B. They conform to certain personality archetypes with Harry Styles the pin-up leader Zayn Malik even referred to by the others as ""the mysterious one"" and then Niall Horan Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson frustratingly difficult to distinguish for the uninitiated. The boys ages 19 to 21 project a playful irreverent image slightly dangerous but safe to bring home to the folks. To paraphrase the 60s girl group the Shangri-Las theyre good-bad but theyre not evil. All of which makes documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock a theoretically inspired choice to make the combo-pack concert doc and band history of ""This Is Us."" Spurlocks documentaries such as ""Super Size Me"" have a subversive sensibility and showmans panache that should match up with the behind-the-scenes horseplay of the boys adventures on tour but ultimately the film feels anonymous. Interchangeable somewhat with other recent concert docs surveying the likes of Justin Bieber and Katy Perry the film shows that perhaps the technical apparatus of shooting an arena-scaled concert in high-gloss 3-D simply leaves little room for personalization.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie club The group is both a purposeful manufactured phenomenon and a somewhat spontaneous occurrence because the five individual members were all booted from a televised British singing competition only to be assembled by Svengali producer Simon Cowell as a group in 2010. They then lost again but not without starting a wave of fan adulation that put them on tour before they had released any music. And they have been on a worldwide whirlwind of touring recording and new releases ever since.The movie steers clear of dealing with the boys lives as tabloid stars with no mention for example of Styles short intensely documented romance with musician Taylor Swift. The films most honest moments come from time spent with the boys parents as Malik buys his mother a house and Styles mother and stepfather marvel at being flown around the world by their son. On the flipside other parents speak to feeling that their young sons left one day for an audition and never came back meaningful moments in their lives together lost in the interim. But the emotional reality of contemporary fame is simply not what ""This Is Us"" is about and so such moments are relative B-sides to the films breezy camaraderie and flashy concert numbers.The groups latest hit single declares itself the ""Best Song Ever"" and that sort of odd predetermination seems to percolate throughout One Directions story. The boys dont dance they arent particularly interested in their singing and they seem only nominally invested in their music. So what do they do? Can youthful cuteness be a skill and vocation? ""One Direction This Is Us"" leaves the larger questions it points toward teasingly unexplored making the film little more than a harmless keepsake.mark.olsenlatimes.com ------------------------------One Direction This Is UsMPAA rating PG for mild languageRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Music Movies One Direction This Is Us Harry Styles New Products One Direction (music group) This Is Us keeps it light and fun for One Directions young fans On slow Labor Day weekend tweens will turn out for One Direction One Direction This Is Us premieres and the guys look like stars Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-one-direction-review-20130830,0,6776439.story",200,onedirectionthisisus4,onedirectionthisisus,latimes

By Gabe Johnson on Publish Date August 30 2013. . Watch in Times Video >> embed The popularity of the British-Irish boy band One Direction has been fueled largely by extraordinarily active Twitter fans mostly tween and teenage girls. But seeing ""One Direction This Is Us"" is a chance to experience that high-pitched hysteria viscerally as the girls in the theater call out for their favorite band members. Affections seem equally divided except for one member Harry Styles the obvious heartthrob who resembles a less gnomish Mick Jagger.Though the 3-D effects in this concert film directed by Morgan Spurlock (""Super Size Me"") are barely noticed its enhanced real-life surround sound can be alternately terrifying and a little thrilling.The film contains enough gratuitous naked torsos that it is sure to satisfy those fans. But is it of interest to anyone else? It is a chance to ponder just why these five ""boys"" who range in age from 19 to 21 are pegged as the new Justin Biebers. Unlike Mr. Bieber they dont seem to be musical prodigies. Only one plays an instrument onstage and none of them dance well. Photo From left Louis Tomlinson Zayn Malik Liam Payne Niall Horan and Harry Styles in ""One Direction This Is Us"" a documentary directed by Morgan Spurlock. Credit Calvin Aurand/TriStar Pictures Mr. Spurlock centers the film on performances that are not particularly riveting as the guys slouch over microphones singing to girls in the crowds and directly to the camera about how they love their fans and think theyre perfect despite their stomachs and thighs. ""They say what we want to hear and what no one say to us"" one fan says.The scale of the groups intense following has been compared to Beatlemania though it might be more accurate to liken One Direction to a tossed salad of 1960s British Invasion bands. Its as if Mr. Jagger and Ringo Starr had been in Hermans Hermits. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The backstage performances rather than those onstage make the film watchable. Mr. Spurlock hopes to get across that unlike past prefab boy bands these are five very different characters who happen to be in a group. And thats the truth The members were put together on the ""The X Factor"" three years ago after each auditioned individually. (Simon Cowell a judge on that show is a producer of this film.) In a previous era they might have been in rival bands of different styles. Instead their popularity seems reflective of certain magpie tendencies today an indiscriminate and imitative mixing of influences from the Backstreet Boys to classic rock a borrowing of whatever is useful.With a group so evidently versed in the visuals of rock history its a shame that a filmmaker wasnt hired who would pay homage to classic pop films instead of offering a satisfactory paid promotional. In the end credits -- Richard Lester-style scenes of the boys in costumes doing pranks -- we see how this film might have been more successful as an obvious fiction starring these appealing personalities rather than a tame and somewhat fake documentary.""One Direction This Is Us"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild language.

The film recounts their history--the quintet competed individually on U.K. singing contest The X Factor in 2010 only to be lumped together as a bubblegum juggernaut by pop-music overlord Simon Cowell (who appears in the first few minutes to take credit then thankfully disappears). Not even His Satanic Majestys smarminess however could obliterate their earnestness and charm on the way up the charts. Less successful is the travelogue that takes up much of the running time memorable mainly for how similar it makes each city seem screaming fans stadium greenroom impossibly big stage rinse repeat. Adoring hordes will no doubt devour shots of shirtless head hunk Harry simmering ""quiet one"" Zayn and the others goofing on their minders while nonacolytes will giggle over the Jackass-lite pranks that seem to fill most of their downtime. Any suggestions of alcohol drugs or Taylor Swift are predictably absent. For his part documentarian Morgan Spurlock (Super Size Me) adds a few quirks bringing out a neurologist to cheekily explain the science of fandom. (Shrieking girls are dopamine junkies people) The boys parents--mainly working-class some divorced--reflect on the empty nests the groups success has left behind. One mum worries whatll happen after the spotlight fades and shes left to ""pick up the pieces""; another buys a cardboard cutout of her son at the MSG gift shop to kiss good night. Those moments of levity mixed with a bit of local-lads-made-good reportage give some needed direction to the bands otherwise unfinished story.

But at the last minute show creator Simon Cowell decided to have them compete as a group launching them to global stardom. These are the facts that many people if they know anything about One Direction already know. Theyre also more or less the only facts that the concert documentary ""One Direction This Is Us"" bothers to share. Its unlikely that anyone will leave with more information than they had going in. Its not that Harry Styles Zayn Malik Liam Payne Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson arent charming and likable.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it ""This Is Us"" reveals little about One Direction -- from left Liam Payne Louis Tomlinson Zayn Malik Harry Styles and Niall Horan. (Christie Goodwin) By Stephanie Merry August 29 2013 Follow stephmerry Morgan Spurlock is one tricky guy. The documentarian best known for the eye-opening award-winning ""Super Size Me"" now makes a persuasive case not for the dangers of fast food but for the dizzying virtues of a British boy band. And ""One Direction This Is Us"" comes this close to convincing someone who routinely avoids the song ""What Makes You Beautiful"" at all costs that this quintet of skinny-jeaned heartthrobs has the coolest cutest nicest and most talented musicians in all the land. But Im on to you Spurlock. There are holes in your story about five lads who dont appear to ever drink smoke fight curse or partake in romantic dalliances of any kind. At least not on screen. Of course the movie is tailored specifically for One Directions uncontrollably ecstatic fan base of more than 14 million Twitter followers. That group consists mainly of tween girls so a PG rating is a must but Spurlock paints the band members -- Niall Horan Zayn Malik Liam Payne Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson -- as superhuman even as the guys humbly insist theyre just average blokes. The meteoric rise of One Direction is a compelling tale of chance. ""X Factor"" producer-turned-puppetmaster Simon Cowell recounts how in 2010 he threw together five talented individual contestants on a whim. The newly formed group didnt win the British incarnation of the show that season but they garnered a massive fan base which propelled them to unfathomable stardom. They sold out their 2013 arena tour in minutes according to the documentary. From there the movie blends concert footage with backstage antics and the tomfoolery that accompanies bus rides and hotel stays. There are a few inspired additional interviews including a neuroscientist who describes why One Direction fans lose control of their decibel level and tear ducts upon seeing the young men. The guys who ranged in age from 19 to 21 during the filming are portrayed as merry pranksters. They pull each others pants down on stage and dress in disguises to surprise fans; they make wheelies with golf carts and push each other around in trash bins. To add a bit of emotion the film hears from the boys mothers (the mere sight of these women elicited emotional sighs during an early screening) and follows the five as they take a break from touring to return home. But for the most part the movie embraces harmless fun which can be enjoyable for the audience members whether theyre 1D fans or not. Most of the singers dont mind their boy-band designation but they insist they arent the typical commodity. For one thing they cant dance although they faux-try with hilarious results. They also have a little edge Malik says. They may sport visible tattoos but watching the boys croon the chart-topping ballad ""Little Things"" makes that claim one of the more dubious. Some of the guys have made gossip rag headlines for their wild ways including drunken behavior but theres no hint of that here. And the supposedly ""all-access"" movie conspicuously avoids any mention of love lives including that of Malik who announced last week he is engaged to singer Perrie Edwards. Maybe showing those details carries the risk of alienating One Directions fans. When the guys sing ""Im in love with you"" the ""you"" is meant to be each starry-eyed listener. But the absence of certain truths makes the movie feel more like marketing material for superheroes than a comprehensive documentary about human dimension. If One Direction fans end up having inordinately high standards when it comes to love Spurlock is at least partly to blame. 1/2 PG. At area theaters.

Updated August 29 2013 332 PM By FRANK LOVECE. Special to Newsday + - From left Niall Horan Zayn Malik Harry Styles Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinsonin in TriStar Pictures ""One Direction This Is Us."" Photo Credit Christie Goodwin advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Nonfiction feature about the U.K. boy band. Rated PG (mild language) BOTTOM LINE Alleged documentary is more like a feature-length reality show. CAST One Direction Simon Cowell LENGTH 135 Why the producers of this behind-the-scenes look at the boy band One Direction would choose Academy Award-nominated documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock (""Super Size Me"") is understandable They wanted to give this feature the patina of documentary respectability. Why Spurlock agreed is only partially understandable. On the one hand this clearly well-funded film from Syco Entertainment a joint venture of Simon Cowell and Sony Music must have been appealing given most documentary filmmakers struggles to raise funding. On the other he must have suspected hed be compromising his credibility by helping manufacture this music companys carefully whitewashed fantasy. One Direction as even those who arent teenage girls must know by now is the U.K.-based boy band thats more or less the male Spice Girls. Assembled by impresario Cowell after each auditioned separately for the British edition of ""The X Factor"" the quintet came in third on that show but met with arena-bursting success afterward. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Spurlocks craftsmanship is remarkable with astute pacing lively and creative visuals fluid cinematography in the many concert scenes and -- a key factor missing from many music documentaries -- a real sense of place providing a feeling of being inside a scene rather than simply observing. Moments when the bandmates parents open up exhibiting stoic gratitude for their working-class sons good fortunes are moving. Yet such well-observed human interactions with the bands stylist or choreographer or security chief are overshadowed by an airbrushed image of celibate wholesomeness without groupies or even girlfriends and where evidently nothing stronger than milk passes these young mens lips. The boys go camping one day ""by themselves"" and with a film crew and were to believe that the core of what Sony has called a 50-million golden goose is left alone in the woods without bodyguards a medic a producers liaison and who knows what else? Despite this and other apparent artifices the boys come off as sensible grounded lads. But with so much of this film like the bands image itself produced and polished to a gleam theres mostly no way to tell whats real in this reality show.

MoviesThe 25 biggest box office hits of all time ROCK DOCS ZEP STONES METALLICA THE BAND Teen fans (mostly female) will no doubt flock to see ""One Direction This Is Us"" the new documentary about the boy band phenomenon this weekend. Here are four other documentaries about bands that also struck a chord. THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME (1976) -- Led Zeppelin was the subject of this mashup featuring footage from their Madison Square Garden concert and band members fantasies (manager Peter Grant imagines himself as a 1930s gangster). THE LAST WALTZ (1978) -- Martin Scorseses acclaimed film goes behind the scenes of The Bands final concert (in San Francisco) in 1976. Rounding out the movie are plenty of guest stars from Ringo Starr to Eric Clapton. METALLICA SOME KIND OF MONSTER (2004) -- The heavy metal band was hardly in perfect harmony as a documentary crew shot them for two tension-filled years as they created their album ""St. Anger.""

Photo Theres a moment in ""One Direction This Is Us"" when we glimpse a band member -- Liam? Louis? There are three of them I cant keep straight -- backstage in his underwear trying on pants. ""Hey Keep the lens up here"" he yells at the camera. Hes kidding but this does seem to be a primary directive in Morgan Spurlocks ""intimate all-access look"" at the wildly popular British boy band Sex must not be alluded to even a little bit. One things for sure ""Down"" is not the direction referenced in the bands name. These boys are up They are cheerful and pleasant They are ever more successful They are crooning -- specifically to you -- from high above the stage on a catwalk Its a winning if not novel formula. The singles -- ""Live While Were Young"" ""Best Song Ever"" -- are infectious; the band is a global phenomenon. Everywhere they go theyre greeted by unruly mobs of screaming sobbing girls. Hence the films shrug of a title. No ""1D"" fan needs convincing about the infallibility of her object of affection -- and his four more mortal bandmates -- and nobody else will go to see it anyway. For the uninitiated The band comprises five lads who all failed to win UK talent show ""The X Factor"" but did manage to catch Simon Cowells eye. He corralled them ""Avengers""-style to form a group with the superpowers of terrific hair and close-enough-to-perfect pitch. Shot during their 2012-13 world tour ""This Is Us"" captures the band onstage occasionally justifying the 3-D ticket-price markup with animated freeze-frames or visible song lyrics. In surrounding footage we see them just being them which is approximately as interesting as a long trip with any group of 19-year-old boys -- minus cursing or talk of girls booze or misdeeds. Unfortunately this basically leaves us with ""Who farted in the bus"" banter and a lot of clowning for the camera. The biggest disappointment is unofficial frontman Harry Styles who I am not the first to notice resembles a young Mick Jagger. Like Mick Harry is said to have a way with the ladies (including Taylor Swift). Not that youd hear a whisper about it here. No personal revelations surface in ""This Is Us."" Also no narrative no conflict -- no differentiation between band members even besides the designation of dark-eyed Zayn as ""the mysterious one"" (he likes to paint). And I really had to laugh at the clip of a British TV host describing them as ""slightly anarchic."" I mean unless Harry being wheeled around in a trash can by bandmates is a veiled comment on the British class system. Also absent is director Spurlocks quirky personality except for one short sequence in which a nerdy scientist explains how dopamine works in the brain -- i.e. what makes the tween girls shriek. Otherwise he constrains himself into generic pop-doc format. Interviews with the boys proud mums are a nice touch as is the scene in which Zayne buys a house for his family. And of course the audiences get their due. ""We have the best fans in the world"" says Niall -- Im really pretty sure it was Niall -- and hes right. The power of social media made this group what it is and they seem appropriately thankful. Theyre such nice boys Still just once Id like to have seen these popsters -- as their own song advocates -- go crazy crazy crazy till they saw the sun.

Tristar photo One Direction One Direction tour film doesnt go very far By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Aug 29 2013 (...) Jody Mitori From left Louis Tomlinson Zayn Malik Liam Payne Niall Horan and Harry Styles in ""One Direction This Is Us."" Tristar photo Imagine how a great documentary filmmaker would portray a boy band. The sudden celebrity the personality clashes the backstage debauchery -- those are the makings of a musical drama. Now imagine the very opposite and youve got ""One Direction This Is Us"" a tour documentary thats so streamlined it could only have been produced by a machine.That machine is Simon Cowells publicity apparatus. Record-producer Cowell discovered five likable lads through the British version of his ""X Factor"" talent show shoehorned them into a troupe called One Direction and released their debut album on his label. Yet the opening scenes of this documentary make it seem as if stardom simply happened that the five cheeky monkeys immediately melded into a musical unit and that the girls of the world spontaneously demanded their presence.A director has to work awfully hard to ignore the nagging questions this story raises such as how five fellows from five different towns feel about their mentor their mates and the music theyve been handed. That director is Morgan Spurlock the brains behind the Oscar-nominated critique of corporate excess ""Super-Size Me."" Spurlock teases the baby sitter contingent with a brief scene where a scientist discusses the neuro-chemical appeal of pop music but thereafter the film is aimed squarely at face-value fans of the Pre-Fab Five.Theres no denying that the guys are cute and cuddly but like teddy bears theyre hard to tell apart. Apparently the one called Zayn is biracial and bi-religious but heaven forbid that any of these guys expresses an opinion stronger than ""Our fans are the greatest"" Those fans get shortchanged as we hear them shrieking outside of various hotel balconies but rarely hear what they love about the band. Although a music-magazine hipster opines that One Direction has an ""anarchic"" spirit and someone in their entourage made them perform a cool Blondie song theyre indifferent dancers and dont play instruments or write their own hits. Will Spurlock be there to document the day when the tastes of teenage girls turn in a different direction?What ""One Direction This Is Us""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 132  Content Mild language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"One Direction This Is Us is inside baseball boy band style review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesOne Direction This Is Us is inside baseball boy band style reviewOne Direction This Is Us which follows the English/Irish boy band at home and on their world tour is a documentary in name onlyBy Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Aug. 29 2013One Direction This Is UsStarring Niall Horan Zayn Malik Liam Payne Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. Directed by Morgan Spurlock. 92 minutes. Opening Aug. 30 at major theatres. GOne Direction This Is Us is movie fan fare as slickly assembled as the manufactured English/Irish singing group itself.But the members of the quintet -- likeable-seeming fellows tamping down evidence of manhood in the service of keeping things sweet with young fans -- hardly seem to be chafing under the demands of being adored.Article Continued BelowThis 3D lovefest a documentary in name only is essentially inside baseball boy band style. Its a full-on positive devotion to singers Niall Horan Zayn Malik Liam Payne Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson.A happy scene from the happy boys in One Direction This is Us.Director Morgan Spurlock (Super Size Me) plays it straight and stays out of the picture -- no subjecting himself to 30 days of listening only to ""Live While Were Young"" to determine what damage it does to his system. Corporation-baiting Spurlock who seems to have undergone some sort of procedure that has drained the cynicism from his body marshals a 3D film crew to give equal time to concert stages and backstage antics as 1D heads out on a monster tour.The singers happily doff their shirts and flash their tattoos acting like cut-ups when theyre not being serious and thanking their fans. Two go fishing and then they all sit around a campfire talking about how happy they are.Theres a retelling of the 1D origins story how the earnest lads with humble beginnings were first put together by pop puppet-master Simon Cowell in 2010 a stroke of (oh go on and say it Simon) genius from the also-rans on British TV show X Factor.They represent a global British invasion on a massive scale although its participants are hardly aware of the world outside their tour bus windows. One band member admits he was surprised at how cold Japan was. He thought it was next door to Australia. The voices behind monster-selling hits like ""What Makes You Beautiful"" and ""Best Song Ever"" belong to personable guys who earnestly hammer home the message that they are nothing without the screaming mostly female hoards they gleefully incite to hormonal hysteria just by stepping to a window. They love music horsing around and especially their families. We see Maliks teary mum struggle to find words to thank him as his family gets the keys to the house hes purchased for them.On the whole their parents appear overwhelmed by their sons success some voicing regret over the time theyve lost with the teens who left for stardom two years before. Its lucky for 1D and their folks that this movie came along. They get a day or two at home out of it for cinematic purposes.This Is Us will have 1D fans giggling with delight as they watch their idols performing close up and (squee) in 3D. Theyll adore this devotional piece that shows the crew onstage and off as jolly self-described ""edgy"" pranksters who consider themselves rubbish dancers but just love to sing.They also like to dress up and walk among their subjects in disguise. Stick around for the credits.Anything relating to males aged 19 to 21 is kept well hidden although there are hints of something simmering in Styles who has a smouldering Mick Jagger-circa-1965 vibe about him. Theres no mention of girlfriends despite the recent announcement that Malik is engaged to fellow X Factor musical creation Perrie Edwards of Little Mix.The only bad behaviour surfaces as brattiness amid authority-challenging hijinks like refusing to quit racing golf carts backstage (echoes of The Monkees).While the 1D crew makes grateful noises about their success they also arent shy about discussing -- in abstract of course -- the often-temporary nature of pop celebrity.The fickleness of teen idolatry may be more present than they know; 1D was booed at the MTV Video Music Awards Aug. 25 the same show where one-time Disney sweetheart and manufactured pop princess Miley Cyrus now 20 transformed herself into a twerking tongue-flicking aggressor who would have scared the purple pants off her kiddie idol persona Hannah Montana.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1109 p.m. EDT August 28 2013Its an entertaining look at the boy band but its not a true documentary.Left-right Harry Styles Liam Payne Louis Tomlinson Zayn Mailik and Naill Horan the members of One Direction star in new documentary One Direction This Is Us which traces their global tour(Photo Christie Goodwin TriStar Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars Harry Styles Louis Tomlinson Zayn Malik Liam Payne Niall HoranRated PG; runtime 1 hour 32 minutes; opens Friday nationwideWhile the 3-D pop-umentary One Direction This Is Us is entertaining enough for those of us wondering what all the fuss is about the film fails to offer a fully drawn portrait of the teen idols.Its misleading to call this a documentary -- fan fodder is more like it.Director Morgan Spurlocks superficial chronicle of the British-Irish quintets rise to fame ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG opens Friday nationwide) offers no new insight for the millions of young devotees of the massively popular boy band made up of Harry Styles 19; Louis Tomlinson 21; Zayn Malik 20; Liam Payne 20; and Niall Horan 19. Most of One Ds largely female fan base already knows -- or thinks it knows -- more about the singers than this film offers up. But for the masses its a reasonably intriguing if rather sanitized look at these seemingly likable young entertainers.STORY One Direction aims at big-screen dominationMORE One Direction movie premiere draws huge crowdREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersAudiences get some of the basic biographical details of the individual singers who were hand-picked and assembled into a band in 2010 by Simon Cowell following X Factor auditions. Though they finished in third place they were signed to Cowells record label and quickly became a global sensation. More about Cowells savvy business sense would have been a plus.For non-fans commentary from sociologists or music experts might have illuminated why teenage girls turn themselves into shrieking sobbing fanatics at the sight of cute boy-men singing love songs. (At an advance screening in Los Angeles a riot erupted outside the theater and police were summoned when a rumor spread that one of the band members was inside the auditorium.)Its tempting to be cynical about this manufactured band but the boys offer a wholesome moderately talented receptacle for budding adolescent sexuality. They have a strong worth ethic a sense of humor and they love their mums. It certainly could be worse.Spurlock spotlights Zayn buying a house for his mother but any mention of a girlfriend is studiously avoided (though he recently announced his engagement). In fact if this documentary is to be believed these guys live in a kind of Hard Days Night frat vacuum.Still they seem to have a healthy sense of irony about all the hoopla. If their youthful antics are any indication theyre relatively unspoiled. Theyre charming good-humored and apparent pals. They have about as good a grasp on instant fame as anyone could hope for.The documentary focuses on the build-up to a worldwide arena tour and on well-choreographed concert footage but some of the better moments are when the boys don disguises and interact with fans behind a curtain of anonymity.Concert scenes are interspersed with endearing snippets of interaction between the bandmates and a peek inside their boyhood homes. We get an inkling of how they grew up and some strikingly similar overwhelmed commentary from their parents. Its not unlike a long-form commercial.Such hagiography is a major departure for Spurlock who burst into the film world in 2004 with Super Size Me a shrewd comic look at the fast food industry. Its mystifying why he even signed on for this project. Why hire a personality like Spurlock and not employ him to do what he does best --wry satirical analysis?Its 90 minutes of One D in vivid 3-D. Sure the content is slick one-dimensional fluff but its enjoyable and moderately captivating not unlike their music. 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/18lxjyp,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/08/28/one-direction-this-is-us/2581969/,200,onedirectionthisisus13,onedirectionthisisus,usatoday

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Attached to many prints of the new 3-D rock doc One Direction This Is Us are advertisements for an anti-bullying campaign in which members of the eponymous group urge its fans to ""live nice."" That slogan just about sums up the innocuous appeal of the films marquee attractions as well as that of this gushing tribute to One Directions staggering international popularity. Assembled on the U.K. talent show The X-Factor when Simon Cowell decided that five teenage crooners might as well croon together One Direction has an origin story as wholesome and uncomplicated--as nice--as its music. Following the chart-topping British boy band on a whirlwind world tour This Is Us intersperses stereoscopic concert footage with lots and lots of scenes of the polite barely pubescent lads horsing around trying on clothes and generally behaving like kids having the time of their young-adult lives. For uninitiated chaperones and good-sport dates warming to the boys aw-shucks charisma will be considerably easier than falling for their sugary disposable arena-pop. At the helm of this fans-only affair is Morgan Spurlock the stunt-loving documentary gadfly who directed Super Size Me and The Greatest Movie Ever Sold. Theres no room here for the filmmakers usual front-and-center shtick He doesnt appear on camera at all which automatically elevates This Is Us to the upper echelons of his oeuvre. Nothing if not deft at conveying loads of information in a colorful manner Spurlock proves himself ideally suited to the gig which mainly requires him to lay out the monster overnight success of his subjects while toggling between onstage theatrics and backstage antics. A few moments feel quintessentially Spurlockian such as an amusing (yet brief) attempt by a scientist to explain the chemical effect One Direction has on its predominately female fan base. (Martin Scorsese also makes a cameo which was probably the highlight of Spurlocks hired-gun tenure on the film.) Mostly however This Is Us counts on the musicians to supply the personality--a strategy that makes it feel more like an anonymous mash note than a warts-and-all glimpse behind the curtain. Then again what warts? Here and there the faintest glimmer of actual drama presents itself. One of the parents for example laments that her son hasnt been home since he left for The X-Factor; in another scene a young heartthrob confesses concern that the girls only like him because hes famous. For the most part though This Is Us plays like a victory lap for its adolescent stars five best friends surprisingly aware that their fame and fortune wont last forever. More delusional is the agreed-upon conclusion that the band wouldnt succeed if it was missing even a single one of its largely interchangeable members. Who do these kids think they are The Beatles? Actually Spurlock makes that connection more than once--first by noting that One Direction has conquered the world even faster than its Liverpool predecessors second by casting the new British invaders in a loose A Hard Days Night homage. Will earworm-catchy ditties like ""What Makes You Beautiful"" eventually give way to psychedelic greatness? Only time will tell though the boys may have to stop living nice--and start partying with Bob Dylan--before they can get in touch with their own rubber souls.

But for audiences willing to spend some time basking in the glow of the teen sensation of the moment this docu-music-infomercial is as palatable and as disposable as the groups hit songs. One Direction best known for their global hit ""What Makes You Beautiful"" is as pre-fab as any band since the Monkees; the five lads in the group had all auditioned separately for the U.K.s ""X Factor"" and when none of them made it to the final tier pop mogul Simon Cowell threw them together and turned them into a band. See video Miley Cyrus VMAs Performance Breaking Bads Hank and Marie Schrader Are Disgusted And while they didnt win ""X Factor"" they did endear themselves to enough British girls who turned them into Twitter phenoms before theyd even recorded their first album. ""This Is Us"" puts a name director behind the camera -- Morgan Spurlock who knows his way around a mass-produced cheeseburger after making ""Super Size Me"" -- but this movie sticks for the most part to the formula audiences will recognize from the recent Justin Bieber and Katy Perry documentaries. Cute baby pictures early ambition big break screaming fans world tour. As with any boy band One Direction has its roles divvied out and the movie makes sure to reinforce them Theres the Funny One (Liam Payne) the Dreamboat (Harry Styles) the Cute One (Niall Horan) the Enigmatic One (Zayn Malik) and the Other One (Louis Tomlinson). The film is less interested in pushing the music (almost none of their songs is performed in its entirety) than in selling us these five guys who have become friends under the oddest circumstances. See video Miley Cyrus Justin Bieber Collaborate on Lil Twists Twerk We get to know them (or at least the image of them that Cowell and company want us to have) and theyre charming each of them seems gobsmacked by the sudden fame grateful to the fans who made it possible and thrilled to be doing what theyre doing. All of this makes ""This Is Us"" a reasonably fun sit but if youre looking for a documentary thats going to rip the lid off what the lives of this band is really like youre not going to get it. There are no fights no diva fits no groupies no drugs not even any bad language. Its as visually stimulating and kid-friendly as a Lisa Frank binder. Spurlock does what he can to jazz up the concert sequences using the video backdrops as a launching pad for 3D graphics that come shooting out at the audience but hes not really breaking any new ground. Whats most interesting about One Directions live performance is the quintets insistence on one thing that makes them stand out from pretty much every other post-New Kids on the Block boy band no choreography. None of these guys are dancers so they dont dance which allows for a seemingly more relaxed and improvisatory stage presence. Also read Miley Cyrus Re-Brands Herself With Raunchy VMA Shocker A Success or Major Fail? Off-stage we see the boys being good to their mums (Malik buys his a house) but Spurlock lets the chronology get muddled which is quite a feat given that this group didnt exist before 2010. At one point Horan mentions that theyre recording their third album and the movie hadnt even mentioned a second one. If more than one world tour is being documented here the editing doesnt divide them up. The movie offers its share of staged moments (the boys go camping in Sweden and bond over the fire) with a few completely random ones (Martin Scorsese comes backstage at Madison Square Garden to say hello; a young Mexican fan shows up in a carrot costume). Theres a brief conversation between Payne and Styles about where their lives might have gone had this band never happened that feels so genuine and unstaged that it makes the rest of the films artifice that much more apparent. ""One Direction This Is Us"" probably wont bring any non-fans into the fold but it will thrill enthusiasts (the underwear shots drew lots of pre-pubescent squeals at an advance screening) and wont completely irritate the short-straw-drawing parent who has to drive those enthusiasts to the multiplex. Like the band itself the movie is too unthreateningly nice to generate vigorous dislike. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Morgan Spurlock talks One Direction doc By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Aug 28 2013 1145 AM The screams started the second the lights went down. This was at a crowded screening of ""One Direction This Is Us"" a documentary by Morgan Spurlock of all people. Its not what youd expect from the director best known for ""Super Size Me."" If you are a teenage girl or know one you must surely be aware that One Direction are the biggest boy band in the world. So perhaps the screaming which was of the type usually heard only at concerts when the house lights go down and the main act is about to take the stage shouldnt have been a surprise. If you arent familiar with One Direction and wonder why Harry Styles taking his shirt off produces such shrieking you might suspect that a wild animal had gotten loose in the theater or something. What the hell is going on? Oh. Harry took his shirt off again. Granted this bellyaching sounds like some geezer griping about the Beatles on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" and wondering what the fuss is over these four guys causing such a volcanic reaction. But seriously One Direction arent the Beatles and although the movie is pleasant enough too often Morgan Spurlock isnt Morgan Spurlock. The director is known for visually quirky choices and offbeat interviews and asides. These techniques can be a mixed bag; sometimes they help lighten up a deadly serious segment other times they seems silly. But its distinctive and ""This Is Us"" could have used more of it. (There are a couple of exceptions that I wont spoil but youll know them when you see them.) The film follows the five guys -- Styles Zayn Malik Liam Payne Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan -- from their start when they failed as individual ""X Factor"" contestants in 2010 until Simon Cowell had the bright idea to put them together as a boy band. They finished third signed to Cowells label and the whole thing went nuts. There is a hilarious scene in which Horan says they really do have the best fans in the world and he will prove it. He walks over to a window behind him in the hotel room where he is talking and opens it. A sea of shrieks rises up. Its amazing and a little creepy. Another time they decide to go shopping. After a few minutes theyre pinned in the store by screaming girls waiting for a police escort to get out. We also see their parents who are understandably proud of their sons and a lot of romping around backstage as various hangers-on remind us that they are still young and have a boyish exuberance. What we dont see are any more mature examples of that exuberance. Girlfriends? Not that we see here. (Styles once dated Taylor Swift which isnt mentioned. Nor is Maliks relationship with Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards to whom he was recently engaged.) Any wild behavior beyond hijacking a golf cart backstage and tooling around while roadies chase them? None in evidence. Of course thats not the point. This isnt ""Gimme Shelter"" the Maysles brothers film about the Rolling Stones during their 1969 tour which culminated in the concert at Altamont when a member of the Hells Angels hired as security killed a fan in the audience. This doesnt set out to be a movie that gets at anything more than making the One Direction guys look adorable if maybe just a little darker than your average boy-band bunch. (This is accomplished mostly through a critic saying their music is a little edgier than bands like NSync. ) Instead ""One Direction This Is Us"" is a glossy fan letter with plenty of concert footage and cutesy interviews lovingly shot for maximum audience reaction. And judging from the screening on that front it certainly delivers. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Director Morgan Spurlock. 95 min. PG. Mild language. The most telling quotes in the new One Direction documentary ""This Is Us"" dont come from any member of the band. They come from their parents who at various times carp about their kids trajectory from the moment they were put together on ""The X Factor"" back in 2010. ""Two days later he was gone"" says one parent. ""I havent seen him in months"" says another. It sounds less like theyre talking about teen idols than about kidnap victims. Lurking in Morgan Spurlocks otherwise boostery documentary is a sense of isolation and exhaustion surrounding its dewy subjects. The director heightens the effect by featuring many shots of the guys flat on their backs -- asleep in hallways venues and buses often stripped to the waist. Naturally that last feature doubles as a lure for the films target audience young girls eager to road-test their budding sexuality. But it also lends a hint of honesty and even empathy to a film that otherwise often plays like just a promo job for the pop stars of the hour. Many quotes run along the lines of ""We have the best fans in the world."" Or ""Were the worlds luckiest guys."" No kidding. The guys warm-milk comments surprise only because they contradict One Directions oft-stated desire to present themselves as slightly saltier than the average teen girl-magnets. In their t weets and on Instagram they show themselves drinking or pulling each others pants down. Here theres no alcohol no smoking and nothing close to sex. From left Zayn Malik Liam Payne Harry Styles Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson in ""One Direction This Is Us"" (Christie Goodwin) Spurlocks film does a good job of establishing just how the five managed to find themselves in the right place at a very right time. The early part of ""This Is Us"" focuses on their introduction as failed individual singers on the smash British show ""The X Factor."" Mastermind Simon Cowell explains his ""eureka"" moment when he decided to cast the five as a single ""boy band"" unified in ""One Direction."" Their route to stardom proves stunningly swift and surprisingly global -- a fact presented here as if it all came down to the magical qualities of the members themselves. In fact it had more to do with new social media which allowed the group to jump borders and circumvent mainstream media with an ease no earlier communication system allowed. Even so the result isnt nearly as ""new"" as the films observers keep insisting. In fact the more routine aspects of all teen idol dom can lend a numbing quality to the screamy reactions that dominate the film. Nearly all the action takes place on tour in front of the shr ieking faithful. The stage footage from Madison Square Garden to Mexico Citys stadium has some snazzy allure. The 3-D effects make fans feel like they could reach out and squeeze them. The slimming quality of the image makes the guys seem more like living dolls than ever. To their credit the guys decided to devote more than half the film to backstage antics and talk as opposed to Justin Bieber whose live 3--D film nervously stuck to the stage. While One Direction come off as fun and lik able no one will mistake their quips for the inspired absurdism of the Beatles in ""A Hard Days Night."" Nor will they take Spurlocks routine camera work for the pop-art panache of Richard Lester. Of the five Harry Styles stands out for his Jaggeresque squints as does Zayn Malik whose features are so doe like and fine he could double for a young Audrey Hepburn. Theres a poignant moment towards the end when the guys sit around a fire in the woods and talk about when stardom will fade. They ponder an arc like the character of Benjamin Button who lived his life in reverse. In part they pine to get this grown-up part of their lives over with so they can settle down and have a normal dull existence. From all evidence here they should slip into that role smoothly. jfarbernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Theyre as hard to come by as a rainbow-colored unicorn. Fortunately both Hollywood and the British quintets money-minting Svengali Simon Cowell have hatched a backup plan a behind-the-scenes 3-D extravaganza called One Direction This Is Us. The film is part of a new breed of movies like Katy Perry Part of Me and Justin Bieber Never Say Never that pretend to give rabid fans (and their heel-dragging parents) a privileged peek behind the curtain. But all they really offer are sanitized squeaky-clean affirmations of what these pop juggernauts fans already know. They exist solely to stoke the furnaces of commerce and move more units. It wasnt always this way. Back in the 60s and 70s revelatory music documentaries like Dont Look Back and Gimme Shelter gave us warts-and-all portraits of Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones that those artists couldnt have been happy with. Dylan came across as a petulant jerk while the Stones were painted as hapless co-conspirators in the death of one of their fans at Altamont where theyd hired the rowdy Hells Angels as security. So much more than mere celluloid press releases these were real movies made in an era less defined by ironfisted publicists and corporate-friendly images when access wasnt a four-letter word. That all changed in 1991 with Madonnas Truth or Dare which similar to the Material Girl herself pulled off the brilliant balancing act of allowing you to feel like you were witnessing something intimate (such as her and her dancers racy backstage high jinks) while never making ticket buyers feel like they were saps -- submissive cogs in her will-to-power machine. The talent of the five likable best mates in One Direction cant be denied. They harmonize like a chorus of impossibly cute angels. And on songs including ""What Makes You Beautiful"" and ""Up All Night"" they ooze so much stage presence that every teen and tween girl in the audience feels like the lads are singing directly to her and only her. But is This Is Us a good film? Well thats another question entirely. Directed by Morgan Spurlock the merry prankster behind 2004s fast-food expose Super Size Me the movie is a chronicle of the rise of five young kids who hit the pop culture lottery. They each tried out individually for the British TV competition The X Factor didnt make the cut and were saved by Cowell who had the commercial genius to recognize that the sum of their golden voices was greater than the parts. He alchemized them into boy-band gold. All of this is dispatched pretty briskly in the beginning of the film because any fan forking over 10 bucks is familiar with this origin story (not to mention the particular personality traits of Harry Liam Niall Zayn and Louis). From there the movie zips through a string of flashy concert clips of the group crooning their hits; reaction shots of young girls crying screaming their lungs out and going ape; and footage of the boys acting up on tour buses and sharing their innermost thoughts about their fans in front of campfires. Its those last bits that Directioners will eat up like Valentines Day candy hearts. Yet these confessional ""unstaged"" moments feel more choreographed than the groups dance moves. Which is a shame because if anyone could have given us an inside look at the guys in the band its a subversive filmmaker like Spurlock. But This Is Us comes off as an impersonal job for hire -- a paycheck assignment. Spurlock seems too scared to bite the hands that are feeding him (although he claims he didnt have final cut). Not once in the films hour-and-a-half running time do we see a disagreement among the mates catch a glimpse of them partying or overhear any of them making a single reference to a girlfriend. (Something has to be informing all of those love songs they sing.) Instead were treated to whats essentially a slick airbrushed promo reel of a bunch of genuinely sweet superstars who cant believe their dumb luck. Thats charming. But its also a little boring. What its most definitely not is a documentary.

His documentaries are fascinated by cheap cheeseburgers product placement and freakonomics and his latest commodity is Brit boy band One Direction five lads shoved together by Simon Cowell on X-Factor. They cant dance and they cant even convince us that theyre fans of their own music but the boisterous blue-collar quintet are predicted to be the first teen act to make 1 billion. For his 3D flick One Direction This Is Us Spurlock spent three months on tour with the guys whirling from Japan to Norway to Mexico but doesnt seem to have asked them a single question besides ""How does it feel to be really really popular?"" Instead he lumps them together like a box of chicken nuggets. Theres the sporty one the suave one the dangerous maverick and the two prepsters you wont be able to tell apart until one of them gets fat or comes out of the closet. Even calling the film a documentary feels deluded. Sure the blokes seem like genuine charmers and the tween screams are ear-splittingly real. But whats more interesting is everything Spurlock edited out. He doesnt film the boys within 30 feet of a beer or a girl and he doesnt dare broach the idea that half-Pakistani heartthrob Zayn Malik deserves to take a second bow for being the worlds first Tiger Beat Muslim. (And a third bow for patiently enduring accusations that hes a terrorist.) His story would make a fascinating documentary.

TWITTER The British boy band sensation shares their bland and beloved brand of pop along with backstage antics in their new concert-tour doc directed by Morgan Spurlock. The 80s had New Kids on the Block; the 90s had the Backstreet Boy; and now boy bands are resurgent again with British group-of-the-moment One Direction currently a chart-topping global pop phenom. While hardly a very incisive look at the band or its five individual singers -- who are barely old enough to even have personal histories -- Morgan Spurlocks documentary One Direction This Is Us which will be released in dozens of cities over multiple territories will doubtless score big for Sony. The holiday weekend should also give the film opportunity to build momentum and word of mouth in the weeks ahead as kids head back to school for the fall. London-based One Direction flashed onto the international music scene in 2010 following the members appearances on British TVs The X Factor. After the band was assembled by show creator and judge Simon Cowell they placed third in the finals for the TV competition. Response to the group among young female fans was strong however -- particularly on social media -- prompting the band to sign with Cowells Syco recording label launching a 2011 U.K. concert tour and garnering a Columbia Records contract for their first studio album the precedent-setting Up All Night which was followed by a North American tour. Cumulatively ""1D"" has reportedly sold more than 13 million albums worldwide including the release of their 2012 recording Take Me Home. PHOTOS One Directions Take Me Home Tour in Pictures Marking Spurlocks first concert doc This Is Us picks up with 1Ds 2012-13 world tour covering more than 100 shows in North America Europe Asia and Australia culminating with a sold-out four-night stand at L.A.s Staples Center earlier in August. Now mostly pushing into their 20s bandmembers Niall Horan Louis Tomlinson Harry Styles Liam Payne and Zayn Malik revel in their globetrotting stardom often performing back-to-back shows for legions of shrieking teen girls their chaperones and even the occasional male concertgoer. This might be a Spurlock documentary but counter to his usual approach the filmmaker doesnt make a single appearance. Shooting the band and their concerts in a variety of formats over six months at a series of international venues Spurlock only wrapped up in June with 1Ds Mexico City show. If the films production schedule driven by the practically nonstop concert dates seems rushed it doesnt particularly show. Throughout the film live 3D performance footage alternates with scenes of ""the lads"" cutting up backstage huddling in their tour bus dodging fervent fans or making promotional appearances. Overall Spurlock plays things incredibly safely compared to his usual irreverent hang-loose style. The concert scenes represent fairly standard fare with 3D visual effects adding a touch of hyper-reality. Individual interviews with the singers create a more intimate vibe with discussions ranging from their musical influences to expressions of homesickness and awe at their rapid rise to popularity. All reportedly from working-class backgrounds (Irish lad Horan is the only non-Brit in the bunch) the bandmates remain humble often expressing gratitude to their fans crew and most of all their mums who pop up in the movie with unnerving frequency. The filmmakers intent to depict them as ""normal guys"" mostly succeeds primarily due to their not inconsiderable charm. Scenes featuring their predominantly teen female fans are limited to crowd shots and brief sound bites while any footage revealing smoking partying or romance has been studiously excluded. CONCERT REVIEW One Direction Elicits Deafening Screams at L.A.s Staples Center The bands songs are crafted by a rotating roster of outside songwriters with plenty of emphasis on romance or cheeky antics and often sung with alternating lead vocals or in close harmony by the group. Onstage performance choreography is fairly basic and not always entirely in sync. Although Horan appears to be the only one playing an instrument on tour the kids singing is consistently engaging as they repeatedly strive to deliver for their young audience -- whether performing one of their numerous pop anthems (powered by a four-piece backing band thats mostly neglected in the film) catchy covers (Blondies ""One Way or Another"") or sweet ballads accompanied by Horans acoustic guitar and plenty of sing-along participation from the concert crowds. While repeated comparisons throughout the film to The Beatles are clearly misplaced both creatively and stylistically One Directions meteoric rise to fame is certainly a characteristic they share with the Fab Four although their staying power might not be quite the equal of their fellow Brits.

Once one reaches a certain age the procession of teen pop idols becomes a cruel reminder of the passage of time and the inevitability of death. For any non-teenager attending Morgan Spurlocks concert documentary ""One Direction This Is Us"" intimations of mortality will be felt most strongly during the ""classic cover song"" section of the groups set wherein the boy band reaches all the way back to Blondies ""One Way or Another"" and Wheatus 2000 golden oldie ""Teenage Dirtbag."" Yet the films central fivesome prove charming pallbearers throughout the film which alternates between inspired and insipid as it hits its hagiographic marks. Directioners should show up in full force.This story first appeared in the August 27 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. One Direction is needless to say an extraordinarily successful English/Irish quintet assembled from the outcasts of a 2010 ""X Factor"" audition. ""X Factor"" overlord Simon Cowell noticed the fivesome among the aspirants and wondered if perhaps assembling an entire group of attractive teenage male singers might prove a winning business model. It was a gamble to be sure but once tethered together One Direction ended up finishing in third place and immediately signed to Cowells Syco Records label where they quickly evolved into a worldwide sensation becoming the first British act to top the U.S. album charts with a debut album. One Direction is hardly the first pop group to have its every formative step stage-managed by TV crews yet its certainly the first to go on to attain this level of success. How the group developed post-""X Factor"" would seem a fertile topic for a media-savvy documentarian like Spurlock -- particularly as One Directions underlying sense of irony seems anathema to Cowells rigidly straight-laced model of pop stardom -- yet the director generally plays things straight interspersing live footage of the boys at Londons O2 Arena with behind-the-scenes shenanigans from their globe-hopping 2012-13 tour. While it lacks anything approaching insight the film does contain reams of squealing fans frequent shirtlessness and cameos from the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo Chris Rock and an endearingly enthusiastic Martin Scorsese who drops in on the groups dressing room before a Madison Square Garden show. Although the group is described as ""a bit anarchic"" by a British critic here any evidence of paramours or partying has been scrubbed clean from these reels and the fivesome rarely say anything of much interest. Yet theyre unerringly charming oncamera and for a generation raised on Justin Biebers Twitter musings hearing the heavily accented Liam Payne describe the group ""proper having a full-on strop"" must seem thrillingly exotic. It helps that the group has a charisma machine in mop-topped breakout heartthrob Harry Styles. Displaying the sort of smirking insinuation one rarely sees from teen idols Styles seems to have spent months studying vintage Mick Jagger interview footage and supplies most of the films bon mots while lounging in bed or gazing half-disinterestedly into the distance. Once his onstage demeanor grows to encompass his offstage insouciance he could be a monster. While Styles is the most camera-friendly of the group its hard not to notice that Zayn Malik seems to handle nearly all the most demanding vocal parts in concert while also getting the least amount of face time amid the backstage hijinks. A retiring heavily tattooed practicing Muslim who pursues graffiti art in his spare time Malik gradually emerges as the most intriguing subject of the five as well as the most underserved by the films function as a purely promotional product. Spurlock does occasionally endeavor to break up the films more formulaic paces. At times hell introduce unexpected digressions such as a sudden cut from concert footage to a neuroscientist explaining the ways music affects dopamine levels in the brain. At others he attempts a sort of Richard Lester-style hyperreality effectively interviewing band members by having them ask one another canned junket-style questions and staging some hit-or-miss high-concept sketches. (To be fair its possible that these lads really do go camping together in the middle of Sweden during their off-hours and gather around the bonfire at night to discuss whether theyll still be mates once the band has run its course. But surely they would normally sit around the fire rather than crammed together in a camera-facing semi-circle.) As for the concert the performance footage is quite well shot and ably tarted up with some eye-catching 3D bells and whistles. Unique among teen idols in their disdain for dancing One Direction actually puts on a relatively no-frills live show singing without any overly obvious backing tracks and supported by a modest four-piece band. Songs -- especially those composed by the troika of Carl Falk Rami Yacoub and Savan Kotecha -- are incontrovertibly catchy and blessed with a bit more of a rockist edge than One Directions more recent antecedents ever attempted.

No warts doesnt even begin to describe Morgan Spurlocks fly-on-the-wall film about One Direction. No warts no acne - theres not even a pimple on the butt of this on-tour portrait of the reality-bred boy popsters (girlfriends or boyfriends or whatever have been airbrushed out entirely). The director is Morgan Spurlock - the man who took on McDonalds in Super Size Me. But you wont find an anti-corporate message here. This is relentlessly on-message crammed full of cheeky shirtless moments for fans of Harry Styles Zayn and the three fillers. Does it dispel the rumour that 1D are a bunch of charisma-free talentless pop puppets? Yes and no. Give Simon Cowell an Oscar for his botox-assisted surprise-face talking about the 1D phenomenon. The boys come across surprisingly well - un-brattish hard working puppy-dog sweet bit self-obsessed. Theyre well-trained. We try to stay away from the typical boy band thing says Zayn insisting theyre not packaged up like iced-buns for 12-year-old girls. Next door Harry is having a row with a stylist. I dont like the trench. Stylist Thats the Harry look. Spurlock ruthlessly goes for the heart-strings by taking the boys back to their home towns. Harry gets his bum pinched by a granny in the bakery where he worked on Saturdays. Zayns mum is in tears walking into the house he bought her. There are a couple of Spurlock moments. The band look blank when Martin Scorsese pops his head backstage in New York (tween-age daughter in tow). Theres a priceless Zoolander scene where Zayn shows off the graffiti room in his new house. The film is as harmless as the band. Until you reach the music. One Direction are bearable with a cover song - Wheatuss Teenage Dirtbag. But the sugary-sweet she-doesnt-love-me-back tracks really hurt. In Super Size Me Spurlocks McDonalds-only diet had him vomming on screen. These songs test your gag reflexes in other ways.

If you are expecting a Tell All then youre being naive. This is for the fans and has all theyll ever need. Smiling idols a few heart felt albeit well thought out moments lots of their favourite songs and even more cute smiling from the boys. Teenage girls will love it parents less so but if it makes their little cherubs scream with delight is it all that bad? Personally I look forward to the 7UP style documentary in the future when the crest of the wave has finally broken and the boys are left to pick up the pieces.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 31 2013Laila FeaturedGreat Movie EverFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 31 2013Laila FeaturedGreat Movie EverFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 21 2013CodyFeaturedThis will be my review of the review.
