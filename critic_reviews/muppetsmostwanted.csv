You have to ask this with a Muppet movie because guest stars are essentially the only variable. Kermit Miss Piggy Fozzie Gonzo Animal and the rest -- theyre pretty much the same. So youre looking at say the Siberian gulag scenes in the new Muppets Most Wanted and asking Is Ray Liotta enjoying himself doing all those musical numbers? And he is. There are a handful of excuses to laugh out loud in this movie -- the eighth such live-action feature and the second of Nicholas Stoller and James Bobins resurrection. But the sight of Liotta as a neck-tattooed inmate twirling and wagging his knees behind Tina Fey (shes the gulags warden) induces a high that lasts longer than the closing credits. To some extent Liottas got it easy. He shares his scenes with Fey Danny Trejo Jemaine Clement some extras in drab prison garb and very few Muppets. Trejo is one of Robert Rodriguezs coconspirators so he knows how to handle family-movie folly. Clement made music and musical television with Bret McKenzie who composes the songs for these movies and Fey is Fey. You expect lunacy from these people. With Liotta you just expect a lunatic. But the mood of comedy gets to him and soon hes dancing and the sight is not unlike witnessing a Muppet leap through the air or ride a bicycle simultaneously real and unreal. The Muppets from three years ago had more of these moments -- it was a smart and very funny reintroduction. It found a way to love Muppetness and mockingly consider how showbiz has changed in the years between the Muppets 1970s-1980s heyday and the 21st century. It also got Chris Cooper to square off against a Muppet in song. The magic feels more mundane this time. It puts The Muppet Show on a world tour and builds around it a caper-movie plot. A nefarious Kermit look-alike named Constantine (Matt Vogel) escapes the gulag and in a mix-up is replaced there by the actual Kermit (Steve Whitmire). Under Constantines rule The Muppet Show goes to hell; hes preoccupied with ransacking banks and museums in pursuit of treasure. Somehow none of the others notice that Kermit now speaks in a cartoon Russian accent and that hes really mean. Their incompetence goes on for too long and that saps the movie of what I love about the Muppets the actual old-timey showbiz of The Muppet Show. With Kermit locked up the tour is putting audiences to sleep but has them cheering at the end of every performance. Thats because their new toast-dry manager (Ricky Gervais) happens to be Constantines henchman and is prepaying for huge applause and rapturous reviews. Not even Kermits protege Walter (Peter Linz) can restore order. With the show in disarray the best numbers fall to the guest stars. Fey for instance leads those inmates through an uptempo doo-wop-dusted number called ""In the Big House."" It sounds like something Linda Ronstadt or Melissa Manchester would have recorded in 1981. Fey caries a tune the way Jesus carried the cross but the movie manages to turn the quality of her singing into a joke that shes in on. The Muppets themselves are overstocked and underused. They do get two good numbers to themselves one in which Constantine seduces Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson) and another staged during an interrogation sequence in which Ty Burrell and Sam Eagle shake down the Muppets for clues about vandalism and stolen art. McKenzie has an ingenious appreciation for pop hooks. Ive never seen an episode of Flight of the Conchords -- the HBO show he did with Clement and Bobin -- more than once but I remember most of the songs. He gives the ones here the same sheen of diet disco light soul and comic lugubriousness. It was worrying the news that the Conchords team would be reviving the Muppets. Would it be arch? Would it carry a hipster odor? It was easy not to miss the ways in which the originals songcraft and peerlessly witty production design obscured a kind of ardency. It was easy to see only cool. But The Muppets which Stoller wrote with the actor Jason Segel was a romance between its makers and Jim Hensons creations and the love infected the audience at both ends of the age spectrum. In this follow-up when the Muppets take Madrid they kick off that evening by performing the opening theme song in Spanish. Its the tours fleeting moment of professionalism. But too much of the joy imparted by Muppets Most Wanted has too little to do with the Muppets themselves.

"Muppets Most Wanted | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; muppets-most-wanted ) Muppets Most Wanted (United States 2014) March 22 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Since The Muppets first arrived in our homes during the mid-1970s with their iconic TV series theyve never gone away for more than a few years at a time. There have been some lean periods - the 00s come to mind - but despite deaths in the family and the passing of torches Kermit Piggy Fozzy and the rest have soldiered on. The 2011 incarnation simply called The Muppets re-invigorated a franchise desperately in need of a new injection of energy. Suddenly The Muppets were again relevant like an old toy dusted off and cleaned up into perfect working order. The inevitable sequel arriving three years later isnt as giddily entertaining as its predecessor but much of the charm remains making this an ideal destination for a family excursion. Muppets Most Wanted has all the elements that make The Muppets popular with children puppets songs kid-friendly humor and a fast-paced story that doesnt try to do too much. It also has all the elements that make The Muppets popular with adults puppets songs kid-friendly humor and an overabundance of nostalgia. Hey for those of us who grew up in the 70s Kermit and Miss Piggy have been dancing around each other for most of our lives. They even came on the scene before Star Wars. Muppets Most Wanted riffs on spy movies prison escape movies and The Pink Panther (without the big cat or the memorable Henry Mancini score). It starts off where The Muppets ended with a musical number about making a sequel then segues into the main story which features the troupe preparing for a world tour managed by the smarmy Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais). Meanwhile in Siberia master criminal Constantine the frog has escaped from a maximum security Gulag. He kidnaps and replaces Kermit reunites with Dominic (his 2) and sets into motion a convoluted plan to steal Englands Crown Jewels. Muppets Most Wanted features only three primary human actors. Ricky Gervais is the henchman Tina Fey is the woman who runs the Gulag and Ty Burell is Jean Pierre Napoleon a French Interpol agent whose instructor was quite possibly Inspector Clouseau (the Peter Sellers version not the Steve Martin one). As is typical for a Muppet movie there are a host of cameos with close to two dozen ""surprise"" appearances from familiar faces like Tony Bennett Celine Dion Danny Trejo Chloe Grace Moretz Salma Hayek Christoph Waltz Tom Hiddleston and Frank Langella. At times watching Muppets Most Wanted becomes a ""spot the star"" game which is okay because the storyline doesnt require a lot of concentration. The Muppet performers are in fine form. Most of them are veterans. Dave Goelz who voices The Great Gonzo (amongst others) is one of the Muppet originals - he has played the character since its birth. Steve Whitmire who took over for Jim Henson after the latters death has been doing Kermit for more than two decades. Eric Jacobsons Miss Piggy doesnt sound significantly different from Frank Ozs. The Muppets dont age and the behind-the-scenes team has ensured that the continuity of how they sound matches the unchanging nature of their appearance. Muppets Most Wanted is no The Lego Movie when it comes to innovative family entertainment. Its a more generic effort but theres nothing in this movie that will hurt The Muppets brand. The weakest element is the unremarkable story but thats also the least important aspect. Were not here to watch a great narrative unfold. Were here to spend a couple of hours with old friends doing new versions of the things we love best about them. Were here to laugh at the corny jokes and roll our eyeballs at the overproduced musical numbers. Muppets Most Wanted delivers these core elements and gives us reasons to leave the theater smiling.

The streets outside the Muppet Theater are still crowded one can almost feel the last notes of ""Lifes a Happy Song"" quivering in the air and wait are those Jason Segel and Amy Adams standing with their backs to us? (Actually no neither of the human stars of The Muppets makes a repeat appearance this time around.) There is a moment of narrative uncertainty--where do we go from here?--before Kermit amp; Co. launch into another ensemble musical number that doubles as a knowing declaration of purpose Were doing a sequel thats what we do in Hollywood. And everybody knows that the sequels never quite as good. Alas this early self-critique proves entirely accurate.Muppets Most Wanted the second installment of the franchise since the 2011 reboot and eighth overall isnt a bad movie by any stretch Kids will enjoy it and there are more than enough clever gags to keep parents amused. But the film lacks the tenderness and rich nostalgia that made The Muppets such an improbable delight. In place of a touching fable about coming of age finding acceptance and putting on a show the sequel offers up a gonzo (so to speak) stew of international crime sprees mistaken identities and prison breaks.Related Story Before the Muppets Jim Henson Tried to Build a Futuristic Nightclub Following the opening number Muppets Most Wanted whisks us away to ""Gulag 38B Siberia Russia"" where we witness the daring escape of the worlds No. 1 criminal an amphibian named Constantine who delivers kicks like Bruce Lee and head-butts like Rust Cohle. And darned if he doesnt turn out to be a dead ringer for Kermit the Frog apart from a borscht-y accent and the small mole above his mouth.It is with this resemblance in mind that Constantines oleaginous accomplice Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais) begins greasing the skids for a switcheroo. Promising the Muppets fame and fortune Badguy--its pronounced Badge-ee he explains--signs on as their manager for a European tour. Soon enough Kermit is framed (a mole super-glued to his face does the trick) captured and locked up in the Gulag where he is conscripted by prison guard Nadya (Tina Fey) to prepare his fellow inmates for a talent show. Meanwhile Constantine having usurped Kermits identity engineers a transcontinental series of heists--Berlin Madrid Dublin London--under cover of the big Muppet tour. Sam the Eagle and Modern Familys Ty Burrell show up respectively as a CIA agent and Interpol investigator assigned to crack the case.The result is a loopy hectic movie crammed full of minor diversions. The many many celebrity cameos include Christophe Waltz (dancing the waltz) Lady Gaga Celine Dion Josh Groban Salma Hayek Ray Liotta Tom Hiddleston Frank Langella and too many others to name here. The inside jokes on offer include references to The Silence of the Lambs Boyz 2 Men Danny Trejo The Spy Who Loved Me and most hilariously The Seventh Seal. As in the last outing the songs were written by Bret McKenzie (whose Flight of the Conchords partner Jemaine Clement also has a small role). And while more than a few feature witty lyrics--Constantine lording his preeminence over Badguy in ""Im Number One"" Were criminals as large / but Im at-larger than you; Nadya describing the amenities available behind bars in ""The Big House"" Its no Hilton not a Hyatt / but you will have a riot--none approach the sublimity of last installments Oscar-winning (God I love to write that) ""Man or Muppet.""As pleasant as it is to spend time again amid the Muppets themselves theres little opportunity for any genuine emotional connection.Though Muppets Most Wanted is made up of many likable parts it ultimately amounts to less than their sum. In The Muppets the human performances by Segel and Adams (and by the human-ish Muppet Walter) helped tether the antics of Fozzie Gonzo Animal et al. This time around by contrast the flesh-and-blood stars are no less caricatures than their felt-and-wire colleagues Fey chewing her vowels like a second-tier Chekov (Pavel not Anton); Burrell playing Steve Martin playing Jacques Clouseau; Gervais scheming superciliously. Theyre all perfectly good within the constraints of their roles but said roles amount to little more than extended cameos. And as pleasant as it is to spend time again amid the Muppets themselves theres little opportunity for any genuine emotional connection. (Certainly not when it comes the ever-more-fraught romantic trajectory of Kermit and Piggy...)So if youre in the mood for a bit of idle light-hearted fun by all means give Muppets Most Wanted a try. But do so with tempered expectations. Its like they warned us upfront The sequels never quite as good.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Director Rithy Panh was 11 when Pol Pot seized power in Cambodia and in this resonant doc he mixes rare footage of the Khmer Rouge with visions of life under the regime that he stages with carved clay figures. The film captures how Pol Pot took Maos Great Leap Forward to new levels of Marxist madness. At times however its like seeing the horrors of war acted out by LEGO Minifigures.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The new Muppet movie is as sweet as a bowl of tapioca. And about as interesting. Putting Jim Hensons beloved felt fur and fuzz creations at center stage ""Muppets Most Wanted"" loses much of the charm generated by Jason Segal and Amy Adams in the series dazzling 2011 reboot ""The Muppets."" With engaging live performers at the forefront that movie had the verve of a classic musical comedy. The follow-up relies on premises and gags that could charitably be called tried-and-true. Its not a washout but it doesnt quite make the grade. Its a time-honored rule of comedy franchises that when you dont know what to do with your characters you send them to Europe. Because baguettes and bidets are inherently funny. Here we have the Muppets performing on an international tour and getting embroiled in ""Pink Panther""-style shenanigans at each stop. Their road show is in fact a ruse devised by their new manager Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais). Dominics boss notorious crime frog Constantine replaces his look-alike Kermit to stage bank raids while Muppet variety shows create nearby distractions. You dont have to reinvent the wheel for a comedy aimed at 7-year-olds and a lot of the action is pleasantly formulaic in a way designed to tickle nostalgic grown-up fans. But this film lacks the human spark that launched ""The Muppets"" to the stratosphere. Gervais is in his familiar smarmy jerk mode -- when it comes to comedy Brits do abrasive better than feel-good -- a toxic tone thats kind of off-putting. As a French Interpol officer sleuthing around the crime scenes Ty Burrell is a very poor mans Inspector Clouseau. The big female role goes to Tina Fey as a stern Russian gulag commandant with Kermit in her clutches. Her scenes are weakly shaped and dont deliver much of a payoff. The three dont get to play off one another stranded as they are in their disconnected subplots. Theres the expected blizzard of famous performer cameos. Thus we have brief indifferent appearances by Tom Hiddleston Lady Gaga and Christoph Waltz. Better used are tough guys Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo with Jermaine (""Flight of the Conchords"") Clement as a prison vocal trio. The best pop-up belongs to an uber-famous vocalist who is either a) surprisingly willing to be the butt of a joke or b) unaware how the film tweaked her footage. MUPPETS MOST WANTED 1/2 out of 4 stars  Rating PG for some mild action. The film dithers through its run time repeating the big show/big heist idea three times. There are glitzy song-and-dance numbers ribbing the fulsome Hollywood musicals of the 1950s. By this late date weve seen that thank you. What remains is a self-referential gagfest. As pretend-Kermit Constantine gives his fellow Muppets what theyve asked for over the years. Miss Piggy gets her gala wedding. Animal gets to play an epic drum solo. The jokes pile up but they dont reach especially creative heights. Its only viewers hoping for a Muppet movie as good as the last who dont get what they want. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Grade B+ The frog that turned ""Its Not Easy Being Green"" into a croaking classic has become part of an evergreen gimmick the old identity switcheroo. In this funny lumpy Frogmore Stew of a movie Kermit gets a doppelganger - a notorious amphibian named Constantine who rules the Russian underworld with an iron er felt fist. Aided by Ricky Gervais who is blissfully restrained as Constantines long-suffering henchman Dominic Badguy (pronounced ""Bad-gee"" because he says its French) Constantine pulls off a plot to swap places with Kermit and lead the Muppets on a European tour. His ultimate goal leaping into the Tower of London and stealing the crown jewels. This movie starts with a droll song and dance called ""Were Doing a Sequel"" - ""Thats what we do in Hollywood/and everybody knows -/the sequels never quite as good."" So its disappointing that director James Bobin and co-writer Nicholas Stoller dont go all the way with this merry Muppety self-awareness and allow Kermit to play both roles. Puppeteer Matt Vogel explained to The New York Times that he ""wanted to create a full-fledged character - a Russian threat out of Reagan-era movies - rather than ""a goofy impersonation of Kermit."" So he gave Constantine flatter eyes and a collar with tighter spikes as well as a telltale mole. The movie is delightfully goofy anyway - that opening number which parodies every kind of film from war movies and Westerns to swimsuit spectaculars and ""The Seventh Seal"" obliterates the fourth wall as decisively and uproariously as the climactic set piece in ""Blazing Saddles."" I for one would have loved to see Kermit preparing for this movie with a dialect coach and consulting with the makeup department on the shape size and placement of Constantines mole. That way the filmmakers could have created a hilariously original figure and burnished Kermits rep as a master thespian. Making the Kermit-Constantine switch even more of a mad meta-comedy might also have given the film a tauter springier framework. After Kermit gets tossed into a gulag and Constantines ""Kermit"" keeps his troupe-mates happy by letting them do whatever they want (he even agrees to marry Miss Piggy) ""Muppets Most Wanted"" simply accelerates into nonstop shenanigans and occasionally inspired burlesque. Christoph Waltz dances a waltz on the Berlin stage Salma Hayek dresses in red-devil tights for the ""indoor running of the bulls"" in Madrid and Kermit turns international hard guys like Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo into a crack Broadway ensemble for the gulags annual revue winning the heart of harsh jailer Tina Fey. The movie overflows with funny moments and Constantine is a terrific character whether hes parodying Tom Cruises moves at the start of ""Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol"" or studying Kermits style on old VHS tapes and muttering in his Boris Badenov accent ""Its not easy being mean."" Its fun to see this sadistic narcissistic frog put Badguy in his place - humiliation and furtive rebellion are two of Gervais comic specialties. Gervais has sometimes overdosed on satirical arrogance; mortification becomes him. The half-dozen new songs by Bret McKenzie are sprightly even memorable especially when Miss Piggy wonders (with the help of Celine Dion) ""how can something so right feel so wrong"" or Constantine beats into Badguys head ""Im number one youre number two."" The filmmakers maintain their goodhearted sense of humor as the characters belt out the movies message Real friends dont just tell you everything you want to hear. Buddyhood has always been at the heart of the Muppets appeal. Even ""Modern Familys"" Ty Burrell as Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon who never misses an espresso break or a vacation (after all hes French) and the Muppet named Sam Eagle now in the CIA develop a Dodo-bird rapport. An epilogue back in the gulag fails to leave you with the hoped-for burst of good feeling but by then everyone has earned the right to take an extra bow.

"Muppets Most Wanted review fun with the fuzz vs. the fuzzy - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Muppets Most Wanted review fun with the fuzz vs. the fuzzy Muppets Most Wanted Jay Maidment / Walt Disney Ricky Gervais with Kermit imposter Constantine in ""Muppets Most Wanted."" Ricky Gervais with Kermit imposter Constantine in ""Muppets Most Wanted."" (Jay Maidment / Walt Disney) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic The only thing better than one Kermit is two. And the only thing better than two Kermits is one with a Russian accent. Throw Tina Fey into a gulag force Ricky Gervais to play second fiddle to a nefarious frog stick Ray Liotta in a chorus line and you have a sense of the zany extremes to be found in ""Muppets Most Wanted.""After the magically nostalgic return of the fuzzy-wuzzies to the big screen in 2011s ""The Muppets"" its natural to think of ""Most Wanted"" as a sequel. Dont. Even when the film kicks off with a glittery showstopping number poking fun at Hollywoods penchant for them. This film is an entirely different creature than the gentle storybook tale that featured Jason Segel and Amy Adams teaming up with the puppets as they tried to resurrect their failing stage career.PHOTOS The Muppets - A brief history Slightly more formulaic ""Most Wanted"" as the name suggests has the Muppets on the run instead of on the rise. It goes a bit gaga on the cameos with Lady Gaga Christoph Waltz Sean Combs Usher and Celine Dion among others.There are nearly as many movie genres as famous faces hijacked for high jinks Its a caper its a prison movie its a love story its a mistaken-identity story there might be a wedding there may be a heist Interpol gets involved. Though there are many delicious little moments tucked inside the action heads in so many directions it can be dizzying to keep up.""Flight of the Conchords"" co-creator James Bobin directs the film as he did its predecessor with a light touch. Bobin and Nicholas Stoller who co-wrote ""The Muppets"" with Segel craft the ""Most Wanted"" screenplay.The caper begins as Dominic Badguy (Gervais) who is in collusion with the worlds No. 1 criminal and Kermit lookalike Constantine persuades the Muppets to take their act abroad. In no time Badguy (pronounced with a bad French accent Bad-gee) packs them onto an ancient train for a European tour filled with calamities competing egos and Miss Piggys ongoing quest to get Kermit to commit. How the train gets from Hollywood across the Atlantic is only one of many unsolved mysteries. PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013While Kermit Miss Piggy superfan turned Muppet member Walter and the rest of the Muppet regulars are putting the final touches on their road show in a very distant Siberian gulag the inmates are stirring -- and singing. Top prison guard Nadya (Fey) runs a tight ship while she nurses a Broadway obsession. She completely misses the prison escape of Constantine the films scene-stealer fabulously voiced by Matt Vogel who like many of the Muppets alter egos voices numerous characters.Meanwhile in Paris an Inspector Clouseau-ish Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell) is not paying attention to anything beyond his well-manicured mustache and his terribly amusing French accent.With all these planets in orbit the filmmakers set about having them collide. It will involve Constantine masquerading as Kermit (Steve Whitmire) despite his complete lack of talent the accent and a difficult-to-disguise beauty mark while he puts in motion a major international heist.Meanwhile Kermit mistaken for Constantine is sentenced to hard time in Siberia where he helps Nadya stage a prison revue. Liotta and Danny Trejo are among the prisoners conscripted into the act. Its a hoot.Indeed the musical numbers are responsible for much of the ""Most Wanted"" fun. Bret McKenzie who won an original song Oscar for ""The Muppets"" is back contributing as is Christophe Beck who handles the score. Veteran choreographer Francesca Jaynes is footloose -- there are stages danced on everywhere and the opener is a high-kicking classic.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenMuch of the Muppet charm is the way in which the puppets interact with one another and with humans as if there were no differences. That essential punch depends on interspecies chemistry. While not quite as explosive as ""The Muppets"" the interplay in ""Most Wanted"" is witty and smart. If anything Fey Gervais and Burrell are a bit too deferential to their costars.Because of the mix of talent -- both species and size -- it is always a challenge to ensure the various realities are stitched together seamlessly. The terrain varies widely as the film moves between Hollywood London Berlin Siberia Spain and Dublin. The weather that accompanies is equally unpredictable. And yet director of photography Don Burgess production designer Eve Stewart and costume designer Rahel Afiley do an excellent job of making ""Most Wanted"" visually pop. With the films sensibilities constantly shifting the filmmakers forget to include as much of the emotional quotient as we expect from the Muppets. Underneath all that fuzz their humanity is their heart. Still there is the real Kermit and the fake Kermit with that Russian accent so it is hard not to have a good time anyway.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com --------------------------------------Muppets Most WantedMPAA rating PG for some mild actionRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies The Muppets (movie) Reviews Tina Fey Muppets Most Wanted Ty Burrell Divergent likely to pass box-office test; Muppets looks solid The Muppets A brief history In Muppets Most Wanted a different tone for Kermit and the gang Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-muppets-most-wanted-review-20140321,0,4313415.story#axzz2wQpQnX3d",200,muppetsmostwanted7,muppetsmostwanted,latimes

(AP Photo/Disney Jay Maidment) The Muppets went national on ""Sesame Street"" in 1969 and the standalone ""Muppet Show"" debuted in 1976 so several generations have grown up with these fuzzy friends. One of the Muppets most important and influential fans is Jason Segel who co-wrote and starred in the troupes 2011 comeback movie. ""The Muppet Movie"" was their first film in a decade and the nostalgia plus the shrewd humor added up to a hit with adults as well as kids.""Muppets Most Wanted"" is a lesson in subtraction. Minus Segel and his affection for the franchise this sequel is basically bankrupt. The formerly blue-chip characters have become counterfeit cousins to Alvin and the Chipmunks.The Snuffaluffagus-size problem is addressed in the opening scene which takes place moments after the previous storys Hollywood ending. Dancing away from stand-ins for the absent Segel and Amy Adams Kermit the Frog (voice of Steve Whitmire) sings an announcement that theres going to be a sequel. But the song like the script isnt smart enough to turn commercialism inside out. Ricky Gervais whos built a career on mocking show-business phonies plays the Muppets new manager Dominic Badguy (pronounced he says ""bad-GEE""). When he books the reunited troupe on a tour of Europe the Muppets are thrilled. What they dont realize is that the tour venues coincide with an elaborate jewel heist -- and that the frog in their midst is Dominics co-conspirator a villain called Constantine (Matt Vogel) who has waylaid the real Kermit to a Siberian gulag.The best gag in the movie is that comrade Constantine adopts a bad American accent and none of the other Muppets notice. Even Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson) falls for his flattery. But CIA investigator Sam Eagle (Jacobson) and his French counterpart Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell) smell something fishy and follow the tour across the Continent. Meanwhile Kermit mistaken for arch-criminal Constantine plots a prison escape while directing a song-and-dance revue for warden Nadya (Tina Fey).

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 21 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 21 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by James Bobin Written by James Bobin and Nicholas Stoller Starring Ricky Gervais Tina Fey and the Muppets Classification G Genre family Year 2014 Country USA Language English The idea of a casting the Muppets in a retro-Cold War spy thriller may have seemed like a better idea when Muppets Most Wanted was green-lit than it does now in the midst of the Crimean crisis but that isnt the only thing thats off about the eighth theatrical feature in 35 years starring Jim Hensons Muppet family. After the charming 2011 reboot starring and co-written by Jason Segel the new film a rather shapeless combo of backstage story and crime caper starring Kermit the Frog Miss Piggy and human sidekicks Tina Fey and Ricky Gervais is a middling letdown. The movie which begins at the supposed wrap of the previous Muppets movie on the streets of Manhattan more or less anticipates the disappointment. The Muppets family is at loose ends and looking for a new project. The first song-and-dance number Were Doing a Sequel a self-reflective joke that doesnt disguise that the idea cupboard is understocked.Soon they have a project brought to them courtesy of Ricky Gervais as conniving impresario Dominic Badguy (""Bad-jee - its French"") who persuades the gang that a European tour is just what is needed. The tour starts in Berlin (the Muppets are taken aback by a poster which says ""Die Muppets""). While Kermit the shows emcee has doubts the rest of the group especially Miss Peggy is enthusiastic about her chance to conquer Europe. Among the many bad ideas is Gonzos ""indoor running of the bulls"" stage number.Behind Dominics machinations is a grand plan to kidnap Kermit and replace him with his look-alike a Russian arch-criminal named Constantine. Soon Kermit is stuck in a Siberian jail where show tune-obsessed prison matron Nadya (Tina Fey) puts him to work rehearsing with tough-guy prisoners (including Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo) for an annual song-and-dance revue that owes a comic debt to Mel Brookss The Producers.Meanwhile Kermits doppelganger Constantine known as ""the worlds most dangerous frog"" has joined the Muppets tour. With the exception of the inarticulate Animal they fail to notice Constantines tongue-wrestling Russian pronunciation (""I em Kyermitt"") and the dab of green concealer he wears on his beauty mark. Constantine and Dominic who call each other Number One and Number Two (which should be a cause for high hilarity among the five-year-old set) have set the Muppets to perform at venues adjacent to famous museums which they rob during the shows. The plan is to cap the tour by stealing Englands crown jewels as Kermit (i.e. Constantine) is getting married to Miss Piggy in an event to rival the recent Royal wedding. Throughout the thieves are trailed by a pair of squabbling detectives Muppet Sam Eagle and a Clouseau-like French detective (Modern Familys Ty Burrell).The crimes and Gervais and Feys performances get stale quickly though the song-and-dance numbers are fairly clever (courtesy of Flight of the Conchords Bret McKenzie). Otherwise adults are encouraged to while away the movie by playing ""spot the cameo."" Actors making brief appearances include Christoph Waltz James McAvoy Salma Hayek Zach Galifianakis and Frank Langella. Music stars include Lady Gaga Tony Bennett Sean Combs and Celine Dion who shares a duet with Miss Piggy in a scene that more or less defines the strategy of Muppets Most Wanted a movie which makes up in sheer volume what it lacks in inspiration.

"Muppets Most Wanted finds its not easy being a cash machine review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMuppets Most Wanted finds its not easy being a cash machine reviewMuppets Most Wanted is a bit of a mess. But Kermit Fozzie Miss Piggy and their human pals all get to business confident that audience goodwill will see them through -- and it often does.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 20 2014Muppets Most WantedStarring Ricky Gervais Tina Fey and Ty Burrell plus the Muppets and numerous star cameos. Directed by James Bobin. Opens March 21 at GTA theatres. 108 minutes. GIts not easy being a cash machine.Muppets Most Wanted makes this as plain as the nose on Miss Piggys face. Just two films into the rebooted Muppets movie series franchise fatigue is already setting in. All involved admit they dont really know where to go -- except to the bank.Article Continued BelowThe film is bookended by songs that parody the perils of following a hit which The Muppets very much was in 2011. ""Everybody knows the sequels never quite as good"" goes one line and aint it the truth?Think this is Kermit the frog? Think again It might be Constantine his evil twin in Muppets Most Wanted.  (Disney Enterprises)  Missing in action are Jason Segel and Amy Adams the human foils for Miss Piggy Kermit the Frog Fozzie Bear and the rest of the late Jim Hensons cloth-headed clowns. Segels enthusiastic pen is also absent leaving Nicholas Stoller his co-writer from The Muppets to do the heavy quipping on his own.Yet they get away with it mostly. In the show-must-go-on style thats always been a Muppets mainstay everybody gets down to business confident that audience goodwill will see them through -- and it often does.Stoller and returning director James Bobin hedge their bets by mixing genre staples road movie espionage thriller heist film and prison breakout picture are all rolled into the Muppet mash.Picking up exactly where they left off unsure of what to do next the Muppets fall under the spell of the conniving Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais) who assures them his surname is pronounced ""Bad-gee."" He proposes to manage them on a grand tour of Europe. Kermit demurs at first -- they dont have a show -- but soon hes caught up in the adventure. Kermit has no choice because hes the patsy for an elaborate scheme to steal the Crown jewels of England. Hes kidnapped and replaced by evil frog Constantine Kermits exact double apart from a facial mole and an accent that sounds like Vladimir Putin trying to invade his space.Naturally nobody else in the Muppets (well almost nobody) immediately twigs to whats going on. Kermit is exiled to a Russian gulag commanded by the comely Nadya (Tina Fey) who turns out to have a yen for musicals and a soft spot for famous frogs.This all makes about much sense as Gonzos show-stopping idea to stage an indoor running of the bulls (which actually makes for a funny sight gag).Its also puzzling to see how many jokes are pitched at an older adult audience a Tony Bennett cameo (among many celebrity turns) Busby Berkeley-style water ballet an Ingmar Bergman visual pun and Nadyas prison crew singing and dancing to a decades-old tune from A Chorus Line -- wouldnt Glee have been more 2014 family friendly?Returning music supervisor Bret McKenzie won the Best Original Song Oscar for ""Man or Muppet"" from the first movie and hes obviously hoping for more gold. His toe-tappers are often quite good but a couple of numbers could have been safely -- and wisely -- deleted.Some jokes simply cry out for the hook. Ty Burrells investigating Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon forever trying to one-up his CIA counterpart Sam Eagle gets awfully close to offensive with his constant mocking of the French work ethic.Yet it hardly matters. You dont go to a Muppet movie looking for anything other than a few laughs with beloved puppet pals. Mission accomplished -- ka-ching -- on that front.You get all this plus Miss Piggys abundant talent and charm. She made me say this.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Special to Newsday + - Muppet characters from left Gonzo Miss Piggy Kermit Floyd Walter and Scooter in a scene from ""Muppets Most Wanted."" Photo Credit AP / Jay Maidment advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The Muppets tour Europe but with Kermits criminal look-alike. Rated (mild action sequences) BOTTOM LINE If you liked ""The Muppet Show"" youll like this Muppet show. CAST The Muppets Ricky Gervais Ty Burrell Tina Fey LENGTH 153 Half of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is a prison movie like ""The Great Escape"" or ""Toy Story 3."" The other half is a caper movie like ""Rififi"" the 1955 crime classic whose title even sounds like the name of a Muppet. And somehow these interweaving halves mesh funnily enough that this sequel to 2011s ""The Muppets"" seems a rightful heir to the studiedly wacky 1976-81 TV series ""The Muppet Show."" If theres anyone here who doesnt like a melange of puns slapstick meta humor the occasional out-of-left-field intellectual joke (its not the first time the Muppets have mined Ingmar Bergmans ""The Seventh Seal"") and repurposed vaudeville routines then fine. More room for the rest of us. Following a self-aware opening in which the Muppets realize they need to make a sequel and now must choose what kind the movie introduces the bad guy Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais). Hes just a henchman however for Constantine the most dangerous frog in the world a Kermit doppelganger whos escaped a Siberian gulag. Before you can say ""Pigs in Space"" Kermits in prison Dominic is managing a Muppet Show tour of Europe and institutions next door to their venues are getting broken into and robbed despite suspicions from an Interpol investigator (Ty Burrell) and a CIA operative (Sam the Eagle). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Kermit has his own hands -- well webbed feet -- full trying to cope with prison life. Fortunately guard Nadya (Tina Fey) has ordered him to direct the annual gulag musical revue. And you havent lived until youve seen Ray Liotta of ""GoodFellas"" Danny Trejo of ""Machete"" and assorted other tough guys doing ""I Hope I Get It"" from ""A Chorus Line."" All that and a rainbow collection of cameos make for safely anarchic fun. The songs unfortunately are undistinguished and Burrells too-exaggerated French accent lacks a certain je ne sais quoi. So while it may not be sensational its still an inspirational celebrational Muppetational Muppet show. Preceding it is Pixars ""Party Central"" starring the ""Monsters University"" duo of Sulley and Mike (voices of John Goodman and Billy Crystal). It starts with a simple plot idea and escalates in classic comedy form. 230 MoviesMuppets Most Wanted trailer PLOT The Muppets tour Europe but with Kermits criminal look-alike. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (mild action sequences) CAST The Muppets Ricky Gervais Ty Burrell Tina Fey LENGTH 153 BOTTOM LINE If you liked ""The Muppet Show"" youll like this Muppet show.

The worlds most famous puppets are wildly enthusiastic. Kermit (voiced by Steve Whitmire) hesitates. Worrying that they need more rehearsal time the levelheaded frog is the lone naysayer. Dazzled by global stardom the other Muppets drown out Kermits objections.MORE Muppets rule humans at Most Wanted premiereREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersOnce they arrive overseas Kermit is replaced by his evil twin. The Slavic-accented Constantine ""the worlds No. 1 criminal"" has escaped from a Siberian labor camp and kidnapped the stolid Kermit. Constantine and Dominic have a dastardly plan to steal the crown jewels. Constantines striking likeness makes it easy enough to impersonate Kermit -- despite their glaring linguistic differences.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A Kermit lookalike gets the Muppets caught up in a caper as they tour the world. VPCAccording to the evil duos plan Kermit is quickly shipped off to the gulag that housed his nefarious look-alike. Once there strict guard Nadya (Tina Fey) quickly falls for the endearing amphibian.It cant be easy to act opposite a band of beloved scene-stealers but Fey Gervais and Burrell (as Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon) pull it off with aplomb. Burrell has a charmingly outlandish style that blends an Inspector Clouseau quality with a hint of Mr. Bean. Some of the movies funniest moments are courtesy of Napoleon whos teamed with a competitive CIA agent the Muppet Sam Eagle.Refreshingly wholesome and cleverly campy its a family film that should appeal to a wide age range though not every joke hits its mark.Director James Bobin deftly balances the talents of the comic actors with the ridiculously lovable Muppet gang. Though not as sweetly nostalgic as 2011s The Muppets this sequel is wackier. The musical numbers lyrics are a hoot and the parade of cameos (from Celine Dion to Usher) is a bonus.The opening number Were Doing a Sequel humorously mocks the concept of this follow-up with lyrics including ""Everybody knows the sequels never quite as good."" Thats not exactly the case though the ongoing will-they-or-wont-they frisson between Kermit and Miss Piggy feels played out.Inspired by 1960s-era crime capers the movie also features some inspired casting with character actors such as Danny Trejo and Ray Liotta.The jokes can be fiendishly funny or absurdly silly as in the last name of Dominic. Its Badguy which he insists is French and pronounced ""Bad-ghee.""As with the predecessor the clever new songs are by Bret McKenzie half of the Flight of the Conchords duo and an original-song Oscar winner for 2011s Man or Muppet. (The other half of the Conchords -- Jemaine Clement -- is one of the comical Siberian prisoners.)Following in the tradition of the original Muppet movies Muppets Most Wanted is a good-humored star-studded spoof that likely would have met the approval of the gangs late creator Jim Henson. 97 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1gDCkWQ",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/03/20/muppets-most-wanted-review/5808715/,200,muppetsmostwanted12,muppetsmostwanted,usatoday

Credit Jay Maidment/Walt Disney Pictures The United States government today called on Walt Disney Pictures to delay or cancel the release of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" on national security grounds. Or at least it should have. Not only might this movie annoy Russia with whom the American government is already nose-to-nose over Crimea but it could also cause any European allies being courted by President Obama to unfriend him and the rest of the country. Photo Ricky Gervais with Kermits look-alike Constantine. Credit Jay Maidment/Walt Disney Pictures The film a music-filled follow-up to the 2011 hit ""The Muppets"" lands poor Kermit in a gulag in Siberia which is depicted just as unflatteringly as gulags in Siberia always are. Vladimir V. Putin is unlikely to be amused. But the real concern in terms of Americas international relations is its sly skewering of our European allies whose work habits vacation-taking and such are mocked relentlessly.That running gag is among the funniest things in this film which makes you wonder about the movies target audience. Its a grown-up joke and there are many others lurking in the rather complicated globe-hopping plot. Adults will find more to amuse them than was offered in ""The Muppets"" but younger children might be left behind. Video Clip Muppets Most Wanted A scene featuring the character Constantine the evil Kermit look-a-like. By Disney Enterprises on Publish Date March 14 2014. Photo by Disney Enterprises. Watch in Times Video >> embed In the story the gang drunk on the success of the 2011 movie signs on for a world tour with a shifty promoter named Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais). Dominic is in cahoots with Constantine a criminal frog who bears a striking resemblance to Kermit. The two work a mistaken-identity trick that lands Kermit in the gulag and allows Constantine to take his place on the Muppet world tour. The Muppet stage shows in various European cities become a tool in a complex scheme by Dominic and Constantine to steal the crown jewels in Britain.Besides Mr. Gervais the film features Ty Burrell of ""Modern Family"" as an Interpol agent (and the focal point of most of those Europe-bashing jokes) and Tina Fey as a gulag guard. Ms. Feys talents are wasted since she is chained to a stereotypical Russian character and accent and she doesnt seem to be enjoying herself nearly as much as an A-list star in a Muppet movie ought to. Photo Ty Burrell playing an Interpol agent with Sam Eagle. Credit Jay Maidment/Walt Disney Pictures The whole film seems to have a vague heaviness to it. The best Muppet movies have been great because they had charm. Theres no charm here really; just self-referential jokes decent but not memorable songs and lots and lots of cameos (again for the adults; not many children are going to be impressed by the presence of Stanley Tucci or Frank Langella).It all adds up to an eventful entry in the Muppet film library but not a classic one. There is however one noteworthy moment In a fantasy sequence we get a glimpse of what babies made by Kermit and Miss Piggy might look like something explored only rarely in the past. The movies elaborate plot might not be the only thing parents find themselves explaining to youngsters after the ending credits.""Muppets Most Wanted"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some mild cartoon violence.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Miss Piggy Kermit the Frog and the rest of their stuffed gang of entertainers take their talents to Europe for the cameo-filled sequel ""Muppets Most Wanted."" (Jay Maidment/AP) By Ann Hornaday March 20 2014 Follow AnnHornaday When ""The Muppets"" came out in 2011 it was the first Muppet movie to hit theaters in more than a decade; the collective exhale was palpable -- and profitable -- as millions of relieved fans flocked to see their beloved yarn-and-wire characters mix it up with Jason Segel and Amy Adams in what amounted to Muppets 2.0. The film was such an unexpected smash that it earned Jim Hensons creations their very first Oscar (well not counting the Grouch) for the brilliant song ""Man or Muppet."" ""Muppets Most Wanted"" cant rebottle that particular brand of lightning but it does a terrific job trying and once again ""Man or Muppet"" songwriter Bret McKenzie -- one half of the comic musical comedy duo Flight of the Conchords -- saves the day with a passel of catchy and amusing ditties that keep the movie humming along even when the plot threatens to sag. Written and directed by ""Muppets"" filmmaker James Bobin with an assist from co-screenwriter Nicholas Stoller the story picks up where ""The Muppets"" ended with the troupe back together and contemplating their professional future. Enter would-be road manager Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais) who pronounces his last name ""BAHD-jee"" and lavishes the Muppets with promises of sold-out continental venues and stardom while a suspicious Kermit reluctantly goes along. It turns out that the European tour that Badguy has arranged dovetails diabolically with a plan hes hatched with an evil green Russian frog named Constantine who could be Kermits double save for a menacing brown mole on his lip. Mistaken identities and high jinks -- on stage and off -- ensue. The Muppets take Berlin; Badguy and Constantine smash-and-grab their way from Madrid to Dublin to London; and Kermit languishes in a Siberian prison camp befriending convicts played by Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo and winning the heart of a soulful guard named Nadya (Tina Fey). If those marquee names get your attention just wait ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is stuffed to its felted gills with notable supporting and cameo performances including a very funny turn by ""Modern Familys"" Ty Burrell as a Clouseauvian Interpol agent. The one discordant note comes by way of the gulag gags With Russian President Vladimir Putin enthusiastically reviving that countrys most oppressive totalitarian past making light of what now seems all too real may strike adult viewers as if not tasteless then at least unfortunately timed. (The backfire also serves as a cautionary reminder to studio executives eager to exploit the newly all-powerful international market.) Even with those misgivings no one old enough to remember ""A Chorus Line"" will be immune to a set piece revolving around a prison theater revue; like most of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" the wittiest jokes and cameo appearances are designed to soar far over the heads of young filmgoers and into the atavistic pop consciousness of their adult companions. As for the youngsters its up to individual parents to decide whether the sight of Kermit being wheeled into jail trussed up like Hannibal Lecter is a tad too dark for Juniors delicate sensibilities or whether their littlest charges will truly appreciate an opening production number that invokes Busby Berkeley and Ingmar Bergman in addition to the Muppets own cherished oeuvre. The title of that song by the way is ""Were Doing a Sequel"" a clever Hollywood sendup that firmly establishes the films governing tone of sly self-referential irony. Gervais and Fey turn out to be the ideal human foils for that enterprise playing along with game professionalism and never letting the audience see them wink (at least not too obviously). Kermit Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang may pick up life lessons about the dangers of getting everything you want the value of loyalty and the importance of listening to your gut but their grown-up chaperones will simply be grooving on the songs inside jokes and zestfully calibrated mayhem. In perhaps the toughest test of all ""Muppets Most Wanted"" figures out how to end on a genuinely hilarious note -- or in this case lack of one. Well played Muppets 2.0. Well played.    PG.

Comments click to enlarge Muppets Most Wanted Video Rated PG  106 minutes  2014 Jim Henson never liked the idea of Disney getting its hands on the Muppets but thats where they wound up in 2004 when his family sold the characters from the beloved TV series The Muppet Show for an undisclosed sum. Weirdly the first two Muppet movies produced by Disney both dwell on nefarious showbiz deals in the franchise relaunch The Muppets (2011) an oil tycoon schemes to buy the Muppets longtime theater and in this sequel duplicitous manager Ricky Gervais sends the crew on a tour of Europe to facilitate a criminal caper. The verbal wit is fairly weak this time around though as in the previous film theres an endless succession of three-second star cameos and a subplot confining Kermit the Frog to a Russian gulag offers the bizarre spectacle of Ray Liotta Danny Trejo and Jemaine Clement singing and dancing as gray-faced prisoners.

Area theaters. This time the movie really is -- as the old theme song promises -- sensational celebrational and Muppetational. That last part matters the most in ""Muppets Most Wanted."" In 2011 the Muppets were successfully rebooted (insert wocca-wocca joke here about lacking feet) but that hit movie was a bit heavy on the humans. No worries about that with ""Most Wanted."" This one continues the Muppet tradition of making the real co-stars up their funny to keep up with Jim Hensons creations. The films slightly overplotted feel is offset by the zippiest musical numbers since the Muppets deservedly beloved 1979 film. This is Kermit amp; Co.s seventh sequel since then as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew points out. The movie starts naturally at a Siberian gulag from which Kermits evil look-alike a frog named Constantine escapes. Ricky Gervais plays Constantines henchman Dominic Badguy (pronounced ""bad- gee "") masquerading as a two-bit showbiz manager helping the Muppets launch a round-the-world stage tour of their 70s TV show. Before you can say ""mahna mahna"" Constantine and Badguy steal jewels from museums near the Muppets venues. And Kermit is thrown into the gulag under the watchful eye of a Russian prison matron (Tina Fey). Luckily the tough prisoners need a director for their song-and-dance revue. Fozzie Miss Piggy Gonzo and the other Muppets dont notice that Constantines taken Kermits place despite that eeevil accent and Animals usually spot-on animal instinct. Then a CIA agent (Sam the Eagle) and a French Interpol officer (Ty Burrell) get involved as Constantine plans to marry an unsuspecting Piggy at ""the most romantic spot in the world"" the Tower of London. From left Gonzo Miss Piggy Kermit Floyd Walter and Scooter (JAY MAIDMENT/Disney) Tina Fey and Kermit in Muppets Most Wanted (Jay Maidment/Disney) Ricky Gervais as Dominic Badguy holds a sit-down with some furry associates. (Jay Maidment/Disney) The evil frog in Muppets Most Wanted (Jay Maidment/Disney) This all moves fast and owes a minor debt to ""The Great Muppet Caper"" the troupes underappreciated 1981 sequel. Director James Bobin who did the 2011 relaunch seems more comfortable now juggling the classic Muppet mix of smart kid humor and wry adult jokes. The well-written wacky music is a boost as well. Gervais Burrell and Fey dive in with gusto to the goofy goings-on. As for the Muppets Constantines squished-face villain version of Kermit is a hoot and his presence balances out the typically screechy Miss Piggy and supermellow Walter the previous movies new addition. Everyone else furry freaky and made of felt is a delight. While we can always use more of Rowlf the dog Dr. Teeth and crusty hecklers Statler and Waldorf theyre all part of a time-tested tapestry.

Photo Walt Disney Studios Movie review Muppets Most Wanted 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Muppets Most Wanted Comedy. Starring Ty Burrell Ricky Gervais and Tina Fey. Directed by James Bobin. (PG. 113 minutes.) With lower stakes after successfully resurrecting the franchise in 2011 the makers of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" were definitely trying to entertain themselves this time around. The new film is less story-driven and darker than ""The Muppets"" but its no less entertaining - especially for those who remember and cherish some of Jim Hensons more madcap and twisted turns. Children in the audience may not be thrilled at the highbrow humor and lack of pointless action but tough luck. Life is more than ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked"" and ""The Smurfs"" sequels. ""The Muppets"" obtained the goal of critical and financial success after its 2011 release but it made one crucial mistake Putting too much focus on its human leads. ""Muppets Most Wanted"" instead inserts a trio of human secondary characters many ""The Muppet Movie""-style celebrity cameos and a wonderful new puppet co-star the master thief (and heavily accented Kermit look-alike) Constantine. The latter decision brings the most humor and grounds the non-Kermit Muppets back to their original state of earnest cluelessness. Best of all it just feels like something the original Muppet creators might have done.

The statement is ominous and more than a little bold considering the franchise has been known for its diminishing returns. But it quickly becomes clear that this will be no ""Muppets From Space."" Director James Bobin and writer Nicholas Stoller return and ""The Muppets"" co-stars Jason Segel and Amy Adams do not. Instead the Muppets hit the road sans human baggage for a European tour - creating enjoyable international incidents along the way. Constantine leads the Muppets (only Animal knows hes not the real Kermit) as unsuspecting accessories in a jewel heist while Kermit is in a Russian gulag run by Tina Fey where his show-running talents are put to the test. Ricky Gervais heaps on the droll wit as Constantines right-hand man Dominic Badguy (""pronounced bad-gee"") and Ty Burrell is an insufferable French policeman. Bobin and Stoller tap into the self-deprecating late 1970s/early 1980s Muppets vibe throughout with many mini-tributes to the old show. At one point Kermits nephew Robin and Rizzo the Rat appear for a perfectly timed joke about their lack of participation in these new sequels. Constantine watches old ""The Muppet Show"" episodes to work on his accent a scene that subtly validates the work of the new Muppet filmmakers. (Other turns are more surreal. A running joke involving Celine Dion is definitely for the pot smokers catching the 10 p.m. multiplex screenings.) After successfully juggling several different storylines the predictable ending is a bit of a thud. Maybe weve been spoiled by ""The Lego Movie"" but theres no surprising emotional wallop in ""Muppets Most Wanted."" There are also far too few scenes involving the Swedish Chef and not enough of Beaker either. Speaking of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker its always a joy to see the names of longtime puppeteers Steve Whitmire and Dave Goelz roll by in the credits as they continue to do their puppetry thing into their 60s. Goelz a longtime Bay Area resident and the original voice of the Great Gonzo has been involved with the Muppets since the beginning. Gonzo doesnt sound like hes aged a year ...

"Muppets Most Wanted review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Muppets Most Wanted  Video Dystopian Divergent rather generic; Muppets too sour Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the Chicago-based film ""Divergent"" and ""Muppets Most Wanted"" and asks Twitter followers what Chicago classics theyd like to preserve in hypothetical dystopia. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the Chicago-based film ""Divergent"" and ""Muppets Most Wanted"" and asks Twitter followers what Chicago classics theyd like to preserve in hypothetical dystopia. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune High spirits and good times are hard to come by in ""Muppets Most Wanted"" the anxious follow-up to the commercially successful 2011 reboot (""The Muppets"") and the seventh Muppet sequel to follow in the animal tracks of ""The Muppet Movie"" in 1979.Im not sure what young newcomers will make of this sardonic take on the felt-covered universe created by the late Jim Henson long before Disney got ahold of it. The pop culture references mostly fleeting have their way with ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" though the sight of Ray Liotta Danny Trejo and ""Flight of the Conchords"" mainstay Jemaine Clement leading a Siberian gulag prisoner ensemble in a number from ""A Chorus Line"" certainly is novel. Some of the jokes sound funnier than they really are. Director and co-writer James Bobin working with screenwriter Nicholas Stoller is an awfully clever guy but the pairs pacing and character instincts are shaky this time out. I did like Ty Burrells fastidiously lazy Interpol agent drinking espresso out of the tiniest cup imaginable. But if youve come to the end of your second paragraph in a ""Muppets Most Wanted"" review and havent mentioned a single Muppet somethings wrong. Weirdly much of what made ""Cars 2"" a drag -- the violent James Bond spoofing and a general cynical sense of mayhem -- has somehow floated over to this franchise installment. The film begins seconds after filming has wrapped on the 2011 ""Muppet Movie."" Right away Kermit Miss Piggy et al. are kicked to the curb once again left without fans or hopes. But the song ""Were Doing a Sequel"" while admitting that ""everybody knows the sequel isnt quite as good"" launches the gang into a new round of adversity embodied by their new manager Dominic Badguy played by a top-billed and terminally blase Ricky Gervais.Off they go on a European tour which turns out to be a cover for a plot to steal the crown jewels. Its masterminded by Kermits dastardly look-alike Constantine a Cold War-era criminal with a ""Despicable Me"" dialect stolen from Steve Carell. In uneasy cahoots Kermits doppelganger and Gervais sniveling two-faced Muppet wrangler guide the films action with Constantine somehow hoodwinking his Muppet cohorts into thinking hes just regular ol Kermit. Miss Piggy cant figure out her boyfriends newfound garbled dialect and mood swings. Meantime the real Kermit languishes lonely and scared in the forbidding gulag overseen by Tina Feys commander. In the previous pretty good Muppet movie Jason Segel and Amy Adams helped lighten the load and spark a connection between the human and nonhuman characters. Here the atmospheres soured; the beloved Muppets are treated as dismissible straight men women and critters for the venal real-world populace.Bobins credits include ""Da Ali G Show"" and ""Flight of the Conchords"" while co-writer Stoller (whose stuff Ive liked a lot) is coming off ""The Five-Year Engagement"" and ""Get Him to the Greek."" The air of defeatism hanging over the storyline in ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is meant I think to stoke our sympathies for the Muppets and to set up the London-set climax for a heartening load of pathos. Many Muppet fans will be happy to see the gang including the Swedish Chef and the drummer Animal once again. But the films blobby overextended and more bizarre than eccentric. The cameo laundry list this time includes Tony Bennett Lady Gaga Tom Hiddleston Salma Hayek and Christoph Waltz. The songs a serviceably amusing lot are by Bret McKenzie who won an Oscar for ""Man or Muppet?"" three years ago.Part of the problem here is one of proportion The movie throws a misjudged majority of the material to the villains and lets the unfashionably sincere and sweet-natured Muppets fend for themselves. No doubt Gervais Fey and company adore their co-stars as does the creative team behind ""Muppets Most Wanted."" But somethings missing from this sequel and it isnt jokes about how sequels usually disappoint.mjphillipstribune.com ""Muppets Most Wanted"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG (for some mild action) Running time 152Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Muppets Most Wanted Flight (movie) Tina Fey PG Rated Movies Danny Trejo Muppets Most Wanted Latest movie reviews REVIEW Nymphomaniac Vol. 1  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-muppets-most-wanted-20140320,0,1903024.column",200,muppetsmostwanted20,muppetsmostwanted,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its funny that The Muppet Movie The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan are such visual spectacles--Jim Henson and his colleagues worked so hard to keep so much off the screen. But the effort was worth it because practical effects trick photography and complicated puppetry didnt just bring Kermit The Frog Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear to life. They also made the characters tangible and tactile. When Kermit bicycles in The Muppet Movie his movements arent totally fluid but hes still part of the scene--same as the bike the road and that intimidating billboard for Doc Hoppers Frog Legs. By contrast moviegoers meet Muppets Most Wanteds villainous Kermit lookalike Constantine in a flurry of blue-screened parkour. The prison escape that kicks off the films globetrotting adventure looks less like the handcrafted work of Henson and more like a color-adjusted excerpt from a Sonic The Hedgehog game.Its disappointing that Disneys Muppet movies are possessed of such cold visual modernity because director James Bobin and screenwriter Nicholas Stoller otherwise have a strong grasp on what makes these characters work. In Muppets Most Wanted thats a callback to the old Henson adage that all Muppet scenes end in one of two ways Either someone gets eaten or something blows up. In spiking their Muppets sequel with elements of heist films action-adventure flicks and prison-escape movies Bobin and Stoller restore the sense of comedic chaos that defines Kermit and companys funniest most spontaneous efforts. Thats paramount to this rebooted Muppets franchise as reverence for the characters and an understanding of how and why they tick is the last remaining tie to Hensons 1970s and 80s heyday. With the major Muppet players now played by a second generation of performers (excepting Dave Goelz though Gonzo The Great and Bunsen Honeydew are increasingly reduced to supporting roles) the magic of Muppets Most Wanted isnt one thats seen or heard but felt.  With The Muppets taking care of the introductions and re-introductions Muppets Most Wanted pits its reunited stars against a scheme to steal Englands Crown Jewels a collaboration between egomaniacal Constantine and his less-than-loyal No. 2 Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais appropriately oily). With a shanghaied Kermit interred in the Siberian gulag that previously held Constantine the duo uses a Muppet Show world tour as its cover collecting the artifacts necessary for stealing the Queens prized possessions. This leaves a trail of purloined canvases and busted sculptures to be followed by Federal Agent Sam The Eagle and his INTERPOL counterpart (Ty Burrell doing his finest Inspector Clouseau). Muppets Most Wanted wants for neither celebrity cameos (Lady Gaga Usher Frank Langella) nor plot Besides the central caper theres Miss Piggys latest attempt to wed Kermit a similar effort by Tina Feys warden-with-a-heart-of-gold and a Walter-led endeavor to expose Constantine and rescue the Muppets true leader. Its two or three storylines too many contributing to a running length thats 15 minutes too long.But The Muppets are creatures of indulgence and their sense of humor is one of excess. Muppets Most Wanted is a mess of a movie but anything tidier would be a poor fit. The pure comedy of the film helps to keep things moving Stoller has trouble mustering the Apatovian emotion without his Muppets collaborator Jason Segel but his script is still jammed with clever wordplay and witty shots at the fourth wall. Muppet performer Matt Vogel is wickedly hilarious as Constantine making a bigger impression in the first 20 minutes than new-Muppet-in-town Walter (performed by Peter Linz) has made in two whole films. Constantines outsized confidence contributes the films biggest laughs as he offers mispronunciation after mispronunciation with complete conviction. The laughs go a long way toward smoothing over the films pacing problems and its lack of visual pizzazz; the same goes for a handful of Bret McKenzies original songs. Unfortunately theres nothing here of ""Man Or Muppet"" caliber--though the disco pastiche of ""Ill Get You What You Want (Cockatoo In Malibu)"" recalls the best of his work with Flight Of The Conchords.By reinforcing Kermits role as the reasonable lynchpin within the Muppet organization Muppets Most Wanted suggests that a little self-control isnt so bad. Hes the guy who can rise above all the excess after all and at times it feels like Muppets Most Wanted could benefit from following the frogs example. The surplus of ideas within the movie--and its episodic structure--suggest that Bobin and Stoller shouldve followed the momentum of The Muppets back to TV where a rebooted Muppet Show wouldve given them space to stretch their ambitions and allowed their huge cast of characters a chance to shine in the medium for which they were created. When the digital sheen of the new film outshines the lo-fi old-fashioned charms of its stars its almost as if a high-stakes Disney-backed film franchise is too much pressure for The Muppets. In Muppets Most Wanteds onstage sequences the filmmakers display their most penetrating insight into Hensons creations Theyre imperfect. They tell bad jokes they sing off-key and they love disorder. Until someone learns to truly balance that side of the characters with Disneys requirements for a four-quadrant blockbuster the rebooted Muppets will be like Constantine standing in for Kermit Funny but a little weird looking--and the ""Hi-ho""s never sound quite right.Correction This review originally contained inaccurate information regarding the nature of Constantines introduction. According to Muppet performer Matt Vogel the scene contains no CGI though it was filmed in front of a blue screen. Vogel was also misidentified as portraying Walter in The Muppets and Muppets Most Wanted; that role is played by Peter Linz in both films.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Muppets Most Wanted Way More Than You Want to Know About Kermit and Piggys Love Life Muppets Most Wanted Way More Than You Want to Know About Kermit and Piggys Love Life Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 19 2014 729 PM Muppets Most Wanted The lovers the dreamers and Ray Liotta. By Dana Stevens Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais) and the Muppets in Muppets Most Wanted. Courtesy of Jay Maidment/Disney After youve seen Muppets Most Wanted come back and listen our Spoiler Special with Dana Stevens and John Swansburg or download it here ""Were doing a sequel/ Thats what we do in Hollywood/ And everybody knows/ That the sequels never quite as good"" sing a top-hat-and-tails-clad Kermit and Fozzie Bear in the opening number of James Bobins Muppets Most Wanted. The self-referential pre-emptive putdown is a bold rhetorical move to attempt in the first minute of a movie whose predecessor Bobins high-spirited 2011 franchise reboot The Muppets has already set the bar pretty high. Sadly as the movie goes on that lyric starts to sound less like a cheeky self-deprecating joke than like a bald plea for lowered expectations. Muppets Most Wanted does something with Americas most-loved felt-puppet entertainment troupe thats worse in a way than just crassly selling out their unique charm. It fails to understand that charm in the first place to get what it is about Jim Hensons plucky vaudevillians that audiences love and want to see more of. Theres something sour and strained about this movie thats at odds with the usual Muppet ethos of game lets-put-on-a-show cheer. Maybe thats because of the inordinate amount of screen time spent on the rivalry between two villains who are as uninteresting as they are unpleasant. Ricky Gervais plays Dominic Badguy (""Its pronounced bah-JEE. Its French."") the Muppets shady new business manager who signs them up for a world tour as a front for an elaborate scheme to rob the crown jewels of England. The mastermind of this plot is a Russian frog named Constantine (voice of Matt Vogel) a ruthless supercriminal who has just escaped from a Siberian gulag. Constantine is Kermits exact double in every way except for a mole on his right cheek--which makes it simple for the evil frog to kidnap the good one send him to the gulag in his stead and pass himself off as the real (if suddenly mysteriously Russian-accented) Kermit. This early scene in which Dominic and Constantine lay out the basics of their master-servant working relationship gives a sense of Muppets Most Wanteds curious flatness. Advertisement What do we care about the power struggles between a greedy showbiz manager and a psychopathic frog crime boss who happens to resemble Kermit? Or about the fake Kermits struggle to disguise his Russian accent or to convince Miss Piggy that hes the same simple frog she once fell in love with? We came to watch the Muppets--the regular nonevil doppelganger ones--put on a show. Here that activity is relegated to the background with the scenic stops on the gangs European tour--Berlin Madrid Dublin and London--providing an excuse for various jewel-heist-related disappointingly Constantine-centric escapades. I preferred the Kermit/Miss Piggy relationship in its latency phase. I dont need to flash-forward to their future offspring. Actors and figures from popular culture crowd the screen popping up everywhere in secondslong mainly wordless cameos Tony Bennett Lady Gaga Toby Jones Mackenzie Crook Saoirse Ronan Salma Hayek Usher (playing an usher) and others. But unlike in the last Muppet movie where the romance between Jason Segel and Amy Adams characters constituted a major plot point human actors in Muppets Most Wanted seem to exist mainly as brand signifiers of themselves--hey look its Chloe Grace Moretz as a Russian newsboy Its Sean ""Diddy"" Combs as himself partying with the Muppets in a train car For the most part the walk-on guests arent afforded even a brief opportunity to interact with their cloth co-stars making the parade of cameos feel like an empty game of spot-the-celebrity. Ty Burrell has one of the more substantial flesh-and-blood roles as a dim Parisian inspector who teams up with Sam the Eagle (Eric Jacobson) to investigate the jewel heist in progress; he does what he can with his meager jokes most of which have to do with the length of European lunch hours and vacations. Top Comment It might be worth the price of admission just to see Danny Trejo in a chorus line...  More... -rizzo Join In The scenes where we join the real Kermit (voiced by Steve Whitmire) back at the gulag provide the most fun both because the mild-mannered frog makes for better company than his dull villainous double and because Tina Fey alone among the human actors is in top form as Natasha a by-the-books prison guard whos secretly in love with her pea-green captive. Fey sinks her teeth into her characters thoroughgoing silliness Rocky and Bullwinkle-style Russian accent and all. Natasha a musical-comedy fan unimpressed with the level of stagecraft in the prisoners annual talent show enlists Kermit to take over as director. This results in a few funny scenes in which the theater-savvy frog whips a company of hardened prisoners (including Ray Liotta Tom Hiddleston and Danny Trejo) into Broadway-ready shape performing such numbers as ""Workin in a Coal Mine"" and ""I Hope I Get It"" from A Chorus Line. The original songs for the movie written (like those for the last installment) by Flight of the Conchords Bret McKenzie bounce along pleasantly but they dont stick with you--theres no ""Man or Muppet?"" or ""Lifes a Happy Song"" to send you skipping down the street afterward. And maybe this is just me but I preferred the Kermit/Miss Piggy relationship in its latency phase when the importunate Piggy only occasionally bothered the reluctant frog with baby talk and kissy noises. I dont need to hear pig/frog commitment squabbles or flash-forward to their future offspring a green piglet and a pink frog (wouldnt it be a tadpole?) being wheeled in a pram. Muppets Most Wanted was co-written by director Bobin and Nicholas Stoller who also wrote the last installment with its star Jason Segel a nearly identical team for two very different movies. Could it be that Segel with his sweet boyish energy and enthusiasm for puppetry is the missing element the keeper of the Muppet flame who needs to step back in for the next movie to keep the spirit alive? In the absence of Jim Henson hell have to do. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

""Were doing a sequel/thats what we do in Holly-wood"" Kermit and Fozzie sing wearing white and gold tuxes and doing a peppy dance. They quickly follow-up with ""and everybody knows/that the sequels never quite as good"" As they let slip this tiny bit of realness the brow-furrowing felt frog nudges the eternally happy bear off-camera. Kermit and Fozzie (and Miss Piggy and Gonzo and Scooter and the others) have always been about the behind-the-scenes of showbiz. Their classic ""Muppet Show"" which Im lucky enough to kinda-sorta remember from its initial run did a lot to show the biggest stars of its day in ""backstage"" scenarios with their hair down worrying about remembering their cues and if theyd get the best lines. Shtick for want of a better word was what the show was all about and while 2011s well-meaning but slightly disappointing ""The Muppets"" did a good job of bringing the crew back the essence of what made these characters so great was missing. I am happy to report that the warning of the opening song is false - with ""Muppets Most Wanted"" the vaudevillian pandaemonium is alive and well. The last film got bogged down in some ridiculous story about Jason Segel and Amy Adams and some new Muppet nobody cared about. That guy (I dont even care to mention his name hes just that lame) is back but luckily he stays out of the way most of the time. ""Muppets Most Wanted"" got the message loud and clear that we wanted our original guys back - so much so that it gives us TWO Kermits. The real Kermit for reasons youll just have to roll with ends up in a Soviet era gulag run by a musical-loving Tina Fey. Fake Kermit is an Evil Kermit. A Kermit with a mole on his lip also known as Constantin the Most Dangerous Frog in the World. He and his sidekick (Ricky Gervais) have hoodwinked the entire Muppets company into taking their show on a world tour so they have a cover to steal from the great museums of Europe. This allows for a few things to happen. Plotwise it gets Sam the Eagle (repping the CIA) and Ty Burrell (as Jean-Pierre Napoleon of Interpol) to race from Berlin to Madrid to Dublin to London to try and catch the crooks and form a hilarious bond along the way. (I am absolutely on board for their spinoff series.) But it also makes way for a host of dopey variety acts to get a moment in the spotlight. These glimpses of the touring Muppet Show baffling international audience is in a very sense the closest any of the eight Muppet movies have ever been to the old classic show. And just like the show it comes with some odd celebrity appearances - like Christoph Waltz representing Germany (even though hes from Austria) and Salma Hayek representing Spain (even though shes from Mexico.) Mixed with this are musical numbers (from ""Flight of the Conchords "" Bret McKenzie) that vary from the truly tuneful to the silly to the touching. Has there ever been a more tortured romance than that between Kermit and Miss Piggy? (And its even more tortured now that Piggys dueting with Celine Dion - cue Statler amp; Waldorf guffaw.) Naturally the film ends with a big chase and Ricky Gervais in a weird lemur suit and Miss Piggy almost marrying the criminal mastermind frog. The villains plans are foiled though in no small part to the most creatively integrated product placement in the history of film. Fozzie Bear has one of the new delicious Subway sandwiches that features guacamole and when a drop of the green stuff lands in such a way to ""change"" a picture of incarcerated Constantin back to Kermit the jig is up. Before anyone huffs and puffs about sullying the good name of the Muppets remember how these are gypsy showfolk singing for their supper and are in no way above a little hucksterism to make a dollar. Its that no foolin attitude along with all the feel-good togetherness and personal growth and learning about the number 3 that makes the Muppets and this movie so special.

Rated PG (mild action). At the Lincoln Square the Empire the Kips Bay others. The Muppets have always been a bit meta In arguably his greatest film role as a Hollywood producer in ""The Muppet Movie"" Orson Welles took one look at Kermit the Frog and told his assistant ""Prepare the standard rich and famous contract for Mr. Frog and friends."" These days the Muppet self-awareness and vaudeville DNA has recombined with ""Flight of the Conchords"" spoofery for an often delightful result. In ""Muppets Most Wanted"" a zany Euro caper Jason Segel and Amy Adams from 2011s ""The Muppets"" are forgotten in favor of a new co-star played by Ricky Gervais. Kermit reading his card ""Dominic Badguy?"" ""Bad-zhee. Its French"" says Gervais. ""It means good man."" ""Conchords"" co-creator James Bobin (who directed and co-wrote) and his co-author Nicholas Stoller have made a sketch-based film that though heavy on plot chugs along indifferently. When everythings a gag and you know everythings going to turn out OK anyway your attention tends to wander. The movie seems longer than it is plus its just plain too long. Ah but those jokes are frequently brilliant. In some cases theyre not only over the heads of the kids but over the heads of 95 percent of the American public. If you dont know what ""die"" means in German youll miss one great joke and if you dont know that legend says the crown will fall if the ravens flee the Tower of London youll miss another. Theres an evil-twin plot that mocks musicals Cold War flicks and prison movies (specifically ""The Shawshank Redemption"" with Miss Piggy starring on the Rita Hayworth poster). ""Constantine"" is a diabolical version of Kermit the Frog (the only physical difference is a mole on his cheek) who breaks out of a Russian gulag. His motto ""Its not easy being mean."" Ricky Gervais (right) gets chummy with co-star Kermit the Frog.Photo AP/Disney Constantine reunites with his ""Number Two"" in crime the Gervais character who as the new Muppet manager takes them on tour to the capital of Germany because he wants to break into a museum. No one thinks the location is at all strange ""Now on to the world capital of comedy Berlin Germany"" says Badguy. Tina Fey is adorable as a gulag guard who yearns to sing but even better is Ty Burrell as a Clouseau-like Interpol inspector who competes with a CIA man (played by Muppet Sam the Eagle) to try to crack the case as Constantine switches places with Kermit in the Muppet revue and schemes with Badguy to head to London to steal the Crown Jewels. Burrells ""Jean"" drives a wee Euro-car thats so small it fits in the aisle of a theater drinks coffee out of a cup the size of a babys toenail and knocks off for the day at 2 p.m. I picture the French hating this movie. ""Conchords"" star Bret McKenzie (whose co-star Jemaine Clement pops up as a gulag prisoner) composes another half-dozen funny songs though none is quite as brilliant as the theme from ""The Muppets"" ""Man or Muppet"" which won him an Oscar. My favorite is the song in which No. 1 bad guy Constantine teases his junior partner Badguy ""Were criminals at large but Im at larger than you."" That number is almost as clever as the peek into the future when we see what Piggy and Kermits babies will look like Ones a green pig the others a pink frog.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1250 p.m. MST March 20 2014Even if its not quite as delightful as 2011s ""The Muppets"" the sequel has its own charms to offer.""MUPPETS MOST WANTED"" 4 STARS -- The makers of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" pull off a genius move in the films first song-and-dance number a catchy little self-aware ditty called ""Were Doing a Sequel"" about how the next film is never quite as good the original. True enough. But this is still an entertaining movie. (Bill Goodykoontz)(Photo Disney)Story HighlightsA crowd of stars make cameos.Ricky Gervais plays the bad guy (named Badguy) with gleeful menace.Director James Bobin returns but Jason Segel and Amy Adams are missed.The makers of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" pull off a genius move in the films first song-and-dance number a catchy little self-aware ditty called ""Were Doing a Sequel"" about how the next film is never quite as good the original.True enough. But this is still an entertaining movie.Of course ""The Muppets"" the brilliant -- yes brilliant -- film from 2011 wasnt the first time the felt-and-fur favorites made a film (the song makes note of this) but it was the first one in a while. And with Jason Segel who also co-wrote the script and Amy Adams on board it soared.Theyre both gone for ""Muppets Most Wanted."" Which is OK -- the movies are based on a television show that featured a revolving door of guests after all. Co-writer Nicholas Stoller returns however as does director James Bobin who wrote this one with Stoller.But although this movie has lots of laughs and a willingness to poke fun at itself it doesnt quite recapture the magic of the last movie. Close but not quite.PHOTOS Top 10 movie puppetsThe new film begins immediately after the last one ends (we even see the backs of stand-ins for Segel and Adams). Kermit (voice of Steve Whitmire) and the gang are still buzzing with the success of getting everyone back together so they decide that they need to keep the momentum going.Kermit thinks the act needs polishing but the Muppets are quickly recruited by an agent played by Ricky Gervais with gleeful malice named Dominic Badguy. (Pronounced ""bad-gee"" he explains because its French. Uh-huh.)Dominic thinks they need to immediately begin an ambitious world tour playing top venues in international cities all of which happen to be next to banks or art museums or other places cops might call ""high-value targets.""Thats because Dominic is actually scheming with his boss Constantine (Matt Vogel) the worlds most dangerous frog and most-wanted criminal who is a dead-ringer for Kermit.Constantine has been held in a gulag in Siberia run by Nadya (Tina Fey barking orders in a stern Russian accent). But he escapes and soon swaps places with Kermit who is sent back to the gulag where he helps Nadya organize the talent show to be put on by the fearsome criminals. If you dont think seeing Danny Trejo do a song-and-dance number is funny then this probably isnt the movie for you. But its pretty great.Meanwhile back in various European cities the Muppets dont seem to notice that ""Kermit"" now speaks with a Russian accent suffers from stage fright and most obvious of all is willing to commit to marriage with Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson).As Dominic and Constantine carry out their plan CIA agent Sam Eagle (Jacobson) and French Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell) are on their trail sort of. In a recurring bit thats actually quite funny Jean Pierre being French takes a lot of time off with lunch breaks vacations etc.Honestly though the plot is as you might expect just a reason to make one joke after another and most hit their target. Bobin wisely doesnt let anything get in the way of that. There is also an absolute mob of big stars making cameos whose identities wont be revealed here because that kills the fun. (Do keep an eye out for the Great Escapo though.)""The Muppets"" was a blast out of nowhere the return with appropriate updating of a venerable (read old) franchise. ""Muppets Most Wanted"" by definition cant bring that same welcome shock to the system. But its not for lack of trying and it definitely makes you hope the franchise continues.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Just in the last week weve had announcements of sequels to ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles"" and casting news on ""Star Wars"" films. Press releases on new superhero adventures are practically a constant. So its no surprise that after ""The Muppets"" turned out to be a successful revival back in 2011 the little green frog and his heartfelt friends would all come back for more too. After all theres still money to be made. What is surprising is that its not just a cash grab. The new movie ""Muppets Most Wanted"" isnt as hip as the last one which opened with a sarcastically sunny number and kept its ironic tongue in cheek throughout. Neither does it have Jason Segel who had co-written and starred and often put himself centerstage. And thats OK with me. Instead the new film feels a little more like a look back to earlier installments like ""The Great Muppet Caper"" which were less self-referential than just plain silly with a variety of old-time guest stars (mostly in unexpected cameos) fearlessly joining in the childlike fun. The movie which relies more on music than most Muppet films starts with a big production number about sequels (which it cheerfully admits are ""never as good"") then moves to a confidently corny plot about an international master criminal who just happens to be a dead ringer for Kermit. And in a flash theres a frognapping -- and poor Kermie is off to prison (actually the gulag) while the devilish Constantine is leading the Muppets on a European concert tour (which conveniently hits a string of cities with some begging-to-be-robbed museums). Admittedly most of the songs -- which range from quiet-storm soul to some Celine-Dion-ish ballads -- go on too long. And the movie itself is too loud with one explosion after another. (Although a particular projectionist who clearly had the dials turned up to 11 didnt help.) But as the human villains Ricky Gervais is surprisingly bearable and Tina Fey -- as a prettier Rosa Klebb -- is very funny. And although some of the big celebrity cameos fall flat (Chloe Moretz? So?) a lot of them particularly once we get to the Russian prison are delightful. Of course its the most fun for Muppets fans. But if you dont love the chipper Kermit the self-involved Miss Piggy the sweetly foggy Fozzie -- not to mention the hard-to-explain Beaker Animal and the Great Gonzo -- well please sit over there. I dont think I quite trust you. But if you do -- well then youll probably be glad to see them back. And agree with Disney that -- as long as they keep the quality up and the guest stars coming back - it is easy being green. Or at least raking it in. Ratings note The film contains some violence.

James Bobins reboot was knowingly frivolous -- at times it barely seemed to hold together as a movie -- but it also milked the genuine nostalgic power of its plot which built up to a climactic cathartic performance of The Muppet Show itself. The kids in the audience may have wondered why their parents were both singing along and crying at the same time. Itd be impossible to replicate that earlier films unique trajectory; after all it had to reintroduce the homespun ambling charm of the Muppets to a world more familiar with slick CGI and 3-D animation. But any hope you may have had that Muppets Most Wanted would take these characters in any direction besides the most predictable is quickly scuttled with the new films opening number ""Were Doing a Sequel"" in which our heroes sing ""Were doing a sequel/Thats what we do in Hollywood/And everybody knows/The sequels never quite as good."" Related Stories 20 Amazing Musical Numbers From The Muppet Show Its funny cause its true and Muppets Most Wanted pretty much exists on the self-aware level of that lyric throughout -- charming but uninspired. This time no longer worried about reuniting or reintroducing themselves the Muppets are on a world tour with their new manager played by Ricky Gervais and named Dominic Badguy (ha-ha). Halfway across the world however Constantine the worlds most dangerous frog and a Kermit look-alike escapes from a Siberian gulag. Soon enough Constantine has taken over the Muppets and Kermit has been shipped to the gulag where he has to contend with a warden played by Tina Fey (who looks awfully fetching in an ushanka for some reason). Meanwhile pretending to be Kermit Constantine uses the world tour as a cover to stage an elaborate multi-nation jewel heist. Of course the evil frogs evil accent threatens to get in the way. Between Constantines Dracula-like vocal stylings Feys gulag warden and Ty Burrells Parisian detective the film pretty much weaponizes bad accent jokes. The throwaway gags work best which is typical of the Muppets Upon seeing a German sign for the show advertising ""Die Muppets"" Statler and Waldorf muse ""Looks like they put the reviews up early."" As always cameos abound Christoph Waltz shows up to dance the waltz while Salma Hayek attempts to do an indoor Running of the Bulls. Saoirse Ronan has five seconds as a ballerina; Chloe Moretz has two as a Russian newsie. Some of these are pointless some are funny Tom Hiddleston playing a gulag escape artist named Escapo is probably the funniest but I also appreciated seeing Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo singing and dancing up a storm as gulag prisoners. Anyway like they said in Wag the Dog ""Its a pageant."" As for the actual human performances Fey probably comes off the best in part because her character has slightly more to do and shes a more versatile actress. Gervais is his usual insincere self but hes stuck in a part that doesnt quite play to his strengths as a master of embarrassment comedy. Why not give a role like this to someone who can properly go big like a John Malkovich or a Richard E. Grant (who played a not-entirely-dissimilar character in Spice World)? But of course unlike with the previous film the human characters are mere accessories here -- familiar live faces to go along with the familiar felt ones. Indeed its like the reboot never happened. Muppets Most Wanted feels like a film that could have easily been made back during the days of The Muppet Christmas Carol or Muppet Treasure Island. Its not bad exactly; the songs are catchy the cameos are okay and some of the jokes work fine. Set your expectations super-low and youll probably be fine.

All Rights Reserved. If you count forward from Jim Hensons mid-1960s TV appearances with a fringy pup named Rowlf and the lizard made from an old winter coat who would later become Kermit the Frog the Muppets have outlived most of their early puppet peers by more than two generations You dont see any contemporary movies being built around Topo Gigio or Senor Wences (though thats not to say it couldnt happen). The endurance of the Muppets isnt just the result of the creative skills of Henson and collaborators like Frank Oz or of smart business decisions or of sheer dumb luck. Its simply that the Muppets are just ever so slightly or maybe even totally mad. Man woman child Who can resist them? Even TV-watching cats are drawn to their frisky hippety-hopping and flutey gravely squeaky squawky voices. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But after years of success in TV and movies the Muppets star had tarnished a bit. In 2011 the movie franchise was rebooted with The Muppets starring Jason Segel Amy Adams and our furry felted friends. On the patented Acme(tm) Silliness Scale which peaks at 11.5 The Muppets was about an 8. But the new Muppets Most Wanted in which an evil Kermit look-alike named Constantine escapes from a Siberian prison to wreak havoc registers closer to a 9.5. In other words its better.At the start the Muppets realize their recent film hasnt made them as hot as theyd hoped. An oily Hollywood type preys on their vulnerability and persuades them to hire him as their manager. Little do they know that the man who has identified himself as Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais) is really a scheming jewel thief. Dominic arranges a European tour for the Muppets and immediately dispatches Kermit; the other Muppets dont know that their trustworthy frog leader has been replaced by Constantine Dominics partner in crime who looks just like Kermit save for a Cindy Crawford mole on his upper lip that he blots out with green makeup. Meanwhile Kermit is whisked off to the gulag where prison mistress Nadya (Tina Fey looking quite fetching in a fitted Russian officers coat and matching fur hat) tries to have her way with him. Her PG-rated way of course.Film DetailsCritics Pick Muppets Most Wanted RatingPG GenreComedy Running Time112 min. More Info Trailer The story matters only in that it creates opportunities for heaps of ridiculousness and writer-director James Bobin (who also directed The Muppets) along with co-writer Nicholas Stoller mines them skillfully and breezily. The numerous noodley plot points involve the match-up of Sam Eagles taciturn CIA operative with Ty Burrells Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon On the hunt for the escaped Constantine they trek across Europe crammed into a highly miniaturized Euro-car.Meanwhile Constantine and Dominic use the Muppets tour as a cover for a series of heists intended to culminate in the theft of the crown jewels. Because faux-Kermit Constantine -- easily identified (by us at least) by his cabbage-dumpling Russian accent -- couldnt care less about the show the Muppets are left rudderless free at last to execute the ideas that Kermit always nixed. Gonzo for example has long wanted to mount an indoor running of the bulls and when Constantine gives him the go-ahead chaos predictably ensues A mini-herd of legless Muppet bulls storms the stage stamping and snorting and rolling their ping-pong-ball eyes. (Backstage Gonzo laments ""The bulls are out of control Who would have foreseen this?"")Meanwhile in Siberia Kermit has been enlisted to direct the annual prison musical You havent lived until youve seen grizzled jailbirds played by Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo singing the living daylights out of Hamlisch and Kleban. Through it all hes busy dodging the moo-moo gaze of the love-struck Nadya (Fey slinks through several musical numbers with vixen-like ersatz Russian charm). And in the tradition of all the Muppet movies Muppets Most Wanted is studded with brief appearances from big and medium-size stars. To spoil the specifics of the cameos would be a transgression but its probably not giving away too much to tell you that the generally awesome Tom Hiddleston makes one of them.Amid all this mishegas Miss Piggys dreams of marrying Kermit appear to be finally coming true. Except the swain who has swept her off her feet is not her beloved Kermie but the impostor Constantine who appears to be giving her exactly what she wants -- he woos her with a love ballad straight out of 80s MOR radio his satin shirt billowing with the help of a wind machine. At the core of Muppets Most Wanted theres a potent lesson about the nature of love The things we think we want arent always the things that will truly make us happy. Miss Piggy like so many of us is so hung up on the trappings of romance that she mistakes them for genuine love. Shes also under the impression that diamonds are a girls best friend and in this case theyre not. Still you cant fault her for being a dreamer. The day she stops being dazzled by a big honking rock is the day she stops being Piggy. And the real Kermit true-blue -- or is that green? -- to his core would never let that happen.

The joke proves self-fulfilling--but first a little plot Muppets Most Wanted concerns a world tour run by new manager Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais). In short order Kermit is replaced by evil doppelganger Constantine; meanwhile the real Kermit is imprisoned in a Russian gulag run by Nadya (Tina Fey). A pair of Interpol agents (Ty Burrell and Sam the Eagle) investigate. On the upside theres the usual cozy Muppet mix of character humor situation comedy farce satire and wordplay. Fey has one too many musical numbers but shares good chemistry with Kermit. And its amusing to see the likes of Danny Trejo prancing around a gulag. Yet this follow-up misses the genial charm of The Muppets stars Amy Adams and Jason Segel (the latter is also notably absent from the writing credits). Still its easy to forgive when theres another one-liner around the corner--and Miss Piggys costume changes are a show in themselves.

Daily Edition Login to download Muppets Most Wanted Film Review 1201 PM PDT 3/12/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS The fuzzy ones suffer from jet lag on this overseas trip. TWITTER Ricky Gervais and Tina Fey star in the latest adventure revolving around Jim Hensons childhood favorites. This story first appeared in the March 21 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. ""Everybody knows that the sequels never quite as good"" the Muppets boisterously confess in the self-referential opening musical number ""Were Doing a Sequel"" and it proves a self-fulfilling prophecy in Muppets Most Wanted an oddly off-key follow-up to the generally amusing 2011 feature that marked Disneys relaunch of the late Jim Hensons 1970s-80s childhood favorites. Call it ominous timing or merely a weird coincidence but the main bad guy here is a Russian frog and much of the action takes place at a Siberian gulag. What little kids will make of this is anyones guess. But the repetitive storyline about successive heists during a Muppets European tour grows tiresome and the fun is intermittent meaning Wanted might draw a bit less box office than did the series first outing which pulled in 165 million worldwide slightly more in the U.S. than overseas. Theres a touch of Mel Brooks-ian audacity in the conceit of having tough-looking prisoners in a Russian prison camp suddenly go Broadway and put on a song-and-dance show with the approval of the fearsome commander played by a very bossy Tina Fey. But given the geo-political events of the past couple of weeks the entire enterprise will be seen by many adults if not their kids through a somewhat malign filter thanks to the central presence of a Number One Most Wanted criminal frog with a Russian accent who impersonates Kermit in order to pull off a series of spectacular robberies with an unctuous but resentful henchman played by Ricky Gervais. PHOTOS The Booming Business of Ricky Gervais From The Office to Muppets The sequel with director James Bobin returning and co-writing with first installment co-writer Nicholas Stoller literally picks up where the first one left off on Hollywood Boulevard after the successful stage show hastily put on by the reunited Muppets. But even as the fuzzy ones are celebrating on the other side of the globe Kermit look-alike Constantine engineers a spectacular escape from Gulag 38B news he immediately communicates to cohort Dominic Badguy (Gervais) a talent manager who sells the Muppets on his plans for an international tour by slyly telling them that ""I want you to conquer the world."" Those rights will actually be held by Constantine and Dominic who arrange a cockamamie scheme in which every European venue at which the Muppets are booked just happens to be adjacent to a museum or bank that can be robbed during the performance. At their first stop in Berlin where the American entertainers are perturbed by billboards that read ""Die Muppets"" Constantine has Kermit kidnapped and sent to Siberia where he lucks out in having as camp boss a closet musical comedy queen whos all for her gruff inmates putting on a show. Meanwhile Constantine and Dominic plot world domination while the former overcomes suspicions about his accent by wooing Miss Piggy in a way Kermit never did and fostering her dreams of a European wedding. The great event he promises will take place at the Tower of London which conveniently is home to the Crown Jewels the theft of which will cap his career as the greatest criminal of all time. But not if Kermit can help it. Taking a direct cue from the farewell performance of the Von Trapp family in The Sound of Music the little croaker manages a shrewd escape during a performance and somehow ends up in London the next day just in time to allow Miss Piggy at the altar to figure out who the real Kermit is him or the rich guy with the accent. STORY U.K.s Industry Trust Teams With Disney for Muppets Most Wanted Anti-Piracy Campaign The liveliest thing about Muppets Most Wanted is the score. The songs are not uniformly great but they possess energy some clever lyrics and an old-school eager-to-please pizzazz that alleviate the mild tediousness of the arguments over criminal pecking order between Constantine and Dominic and the mildewed refrains of mutual love respect and support among the perennially insecure Muppets. Even talents as formidable as Gervais and Fey become a bit wearisome here in one-note parts that force them to be loudly over-the-top nearly all the time. Ty Burrell gets a couple of laughs as a sub-Clouseau inspector trying to get a handle on the serial robberies. And then there are the celebrity cameos ranging from actors with actual scenes and dialogue (Christoph Waltz Ray Liotta Frank Langella) and singers who chime in for a moment or two (Celine Dion Lady Gaga Tony Bennett) to those who come and go in a flash (Sean Combs Salma Hayek Zach Galifianakis). If what the Muppets themselves say is true about sequels Disney ought to think twice or three times about whats usually true of third installments.

If its the fate of rebooted franchises to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors then lets just say that ""Muppets Most Wanted"" puts a fresher spin on ""The Great Muppet Caper"" than ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" did to ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan."" Even if the 21st century Muppet features dont quite reach the pinnacle established while Jim Henson was alive ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is often as good as or even better than 2011s ""The Muppets"" which wonderfully relaunched the cinematic shenanigans of Kermit Miss Piggy Fozzie and all the felt-covered rest. This latest chapter picks up precisely where the last one left off down to featuring stand-ins for the backs of Amy Adams and Jason Segel who have not returned. Newcomer Walter (voiced by Peter Linz) wonders whats next and the rest of the Muppets start singing a hilarious ditty about sequels and doing everything all over again. (Bret McKenzie the ""Flight of the Conchords"" vet who scored a Best Song Oscar last time around provides a new batch of clever and catchy tunes for the Muppets to sing.) Watch video New Muppets Most Wanted Trailer Gives Fans What They Want A Musical Number (Video) Kermit (voiced by Steve Whitmire) wants his newly-reunited crew to hone their act but everyone else falls for the sales pitch of one Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais) -- he insists its pronounced ""bad-jee"" -- to tackle a world tour. Badguys plan is to replace Kermit with his look-alike Constantine (voiced by Matt Vogel) ""the worlds most dangerous frog"" and to use the Muppet tour to cover up a series of crimes across the European continent. The presence or absence of a facial mole is all it takes to dupe people that Constantine is Kermit and vice versa so while Constantine tries to fill Kermits emcee shoes (despite the fact that he cant even say ""Kyer-mitt"" without an accent) Kermit gets thrown into Constantines old cell at a Russian gulag overseen by no-nonsense Nadya (Tina Fey). The script by Nicholas Stoller and director James Bobin (both veterans of the previous movie) is classic Muppets in that it knows when to barrage the audience with gags and when to provide enough plot to keep things moving right along. Kermit tries to escape the gulag under cover of the prison talent show hes been dragooned into directing -- and if you ever wanted to see Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo perform ""I Hope I Get It"" from ""A Chorus Line"" this may be your one and only chance. Meanwhile Sam the eagle (voiced by Eric Jacobson) now all too fittingly a CIA agent tries to solve the rash of continental crimes with Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell); the latter being European he often interrupts the investigation with lengthy lunch hours and extended vacations. Also read John Henson Muppets Puppeteer and Son of Creator Jim Henson Dead at 48 Try to avoid peeking at the IMDB page since one of the delights of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is the cavalcade of celebrity cameos that come fast and furious throughout the film. Wisely these famous faces never distract too much from the movies real stars and longtime Muppet fans will enjoy appearances by invaluable second bananas like the Swedish Chef (who gets to be at the center of a hilarious Ingmar Bergman reference) Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker and boomerang fish-tosser Lew Zealand. Also read Tina Fey to Star in Produce The Taliban Shuffle for Paramount (Exclusive) Purists who nit-picked ""The Muppets"" for moments of hipness or smuttiness or something else that they claimed somehow besmirched the Henson legend will no doubt find some tiny throwaway moment objectionable but overall ""Muppets Most Wanted"" remains sensational and celebrational proving beyond a doubt that these beloved characters will continue to lead a plush life on the big screen for years to come.

Sporting a title that cant help but smack of wishful thinking ""Muppets Most Wanted"" casts Kermit the Frog Miss Piggy and company in a hokey transcontinental caper that conspicuously lacks the winning blend of irreverence and sincerity that made 2011s ""The Muppets"" such a delight. From the first bars of ""Were Doing a Sequel"" an opening number that shamelessly acknowledges the inevitability and inferiority of most movie followups this eighth feature showcase for Jim Hensons deeply felt creations pokes fun at itself in a way that seems self-deflating rather than cheekily inspired. If its predecessor was more sheer fun (and with 165 million worldwide more commercial) than a Muppet movie had any right to be then this is the picture that likely comparable B.O. success aside will cement a new generations notions of what this durable Disney franchise more typically has to offer toe-tapping moderately appealing family entertainment easy to smile at and even easier to turn off after 20 minutes. On the basis of a simple side-by-side comparison of the two films the missing ingredient is clearly Jason Segel the improbable creative force whose writing acting and singing talents were so pivotal in reviving the franchise the first time around. But Segel has left the premises and hes taken the movies spark and sense of purpose with him; in the game hands of returning director James Bobin who wrote the screenplay with returning co-scenarist Nicholas Stoller ""Muppets Most Wanted"" looks and sounds eager to please but immediately feels like a more slapdash aimless affair trying -- and mostly failing -- to turn its stalled creativity into some sort of self-referential joke. Although theyre newly rebanded and apparently more popular than ever Kermit and friends have no idea what their next movie should be but after quickly brainstorming ideas (""Gonzo With the Wind"" is quickly rejected) they decide to embark on a lavish world tour. Before long the gang has fallen into the slick managerial clutches of Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais) whose name pronounced ""Bad-JEE"" (""its French"") is a pretty fair indicator of the scripts level of wit. Only cautious responsible Kermit has the prudence to object to some of this smooth-talking newcomers more outlandish ideas such as renting out the largest theater in Berlin for their opening-night performance. But the other Muppets increasingly side with Dominic over their frog leader whos already stressed out enough by Miss Piggys plan to use the tour as a backdrop for their lavish wedding and honeymoon (none of which of course Kermit has even agreed to yet). Just when you thought the filmmakers were perhaps taking the notion of ""Its not easy being green"" a bit too literally the full extent of Dominics dastardly plot is revealed as Kermit is suddenly kidnapped and thrown into a Siberian gulag where he finds himself at the mercy of several dozen Russian crooks and Nadja (Tina Fey) a stern but Broadway-obsessed prison guard who harbors a not-so-secret crush on her newest charge. Meanwhile in a ""Great Dictator""-esque twist Kermit is replaced by his diabolical doppelganger Constantine ""the worlds most dangerous frog"" his sole distinguishing features being a carefully concealed beauty mark and a less well-concealed Slavic accent. Naturally as they wind their way across Europe by train it takes the Muppets (save for the ever-perceptive Animal) almost the entire film to realize that theres an evil English-mangling master thief in their midst and that Dominic has been using the gangs musical gigs as cover for an elaborate series of heists each one bringing them a step closer to the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London. (Not-so-hot on the crooks trail is a mismatched buddy-cop duo consisting of ""Modern Familys"" Ty Burrell and Sam the Eagle.) That Miss Piggy Fozzie Bear Gonzo Rowlf and Walter (introduced in the previous film) arent exactly the sharpest tools in the shed is a joke that wears progressively thinner over the long haul though its milked for some pathos near films end as everyone finally realizes whats been going on at which point ""Muppets Most Wanted"" turns into a veritable Kermit Appreciation Seminar. While celebrity cameos have long been a fixture of the live-action Muppet universe not since perhaps the final 10 minutes of the recent ""Anchorman 2 The Legend Continues"" has a movie been so crammed to bursting with blink-and-you-miss-em star turns although the ones here are deployed to rather less hilarious or purposeful effect. Theres some fleeting amusement to be had in the sight of say Ray Liotta in a prison onesie or Celine Dion joining fellow diva Miss Piggy in a black-and-white musicvideo or Christoph Waltz briefly taking the stage to dance (what else?) a waltz. Far more perplexing are the mere seconds of screen time enjoyed by the likes of James McAvoy Tom Hiddleston Saoirse Ronan and Chloe Grace Moretz though their pointlessly brief appearances are ultimately no more or less random than anything else in a movie that spits out musical sequences and movie references (everything from ""A Chorus Line"" to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" to ""The Silence of the Lambs"") like some sort of malfunctioning pop-culture gumball machine. Whats missing ironically -- and what ""The Muppets"" had in abundance -- is the human element specifically an understanding of how the human actors are meant to interact with their soft-fabric co-stars. Nowhere is the filmmakers shaky command of their material more apparent than in Feys scenes; never mind stolen jewels the real crime here is consigning one of the sharpest comic actors alive to a role that gives her little to do besides sing off-key speak in exaggerated Russian vowels and in one particularly was-this-really-necessary moment melt with unrequited desire in front of her own personal Kermit shrine. Theres nothing here to match let alone top the gleeful sight of Segels overgrown man-child and Amy Adams perky heroine performing alongside the Muppets with an enthusiastic sense of surrender that soon became the audiences own. Almost everything here by contrast has been placed in desperately unfunny air quotes predicated on a general assumption of the Muppets appeal but not truly keyed into it. Shot primarily in the U.K. the pic looks bright and cheery per usual franchise specifications and Bret McKenzie (of ""Flight of the Conchords"" which Bobin co-created) contributes another slate of hummable original songs. For inspired comic lunacy however the picture has little on the clever preceding short ""Party Central"" in which the ""Monsters University"" gang uses a stolen door to lure monsters away from the most popular frat house on campus.

Miss P says November 18 2014 at 839 am Potato potata. Loved both. Great jokes all around. Zingy Zongo style writing in the latest. Keep the sequels coming Reply Janice says March 24 2014 at 600 am I couldnt agree more. I have been a Muppets fan for years and I feel like this movie focused more on the human actors than the Muppets themselves. The only Muppets we really saw the whole time were Kermit and his doppleganger. And no one noticed that Animal left with Fozzie and Walter to rescue Kermit?? Really?? Overall it was a huge disappointment. I think your review was spot-on. Reply Nate Downs says March 23 2014 at 1213 pm Do you even understand anything about what makes the Muppets the Muppets? Go back to school to learn more about things that you will never understand in practicality. Humans should never be the focal point of the Muppets. The focal point is that they are Monty Python in felt form. They are anarchists of film and television. This go round is a far tighter movie than the last. More original songs in the flavor of what makes the Muppets the Muppets. No constraints of human characters as the focal point their love story taking away from the true stars of the film. The film is edited better than the last having a true story arc with a fleshed out (or rather felted) villain. And the third act is indeed a true third act not a revisited version of The Muppet Show. Reply Anne says March 15 2014 at 409 pm I completely agree. I went to a screening this morning all excited and before the opening number was over I knew it was a stinker. What a supreme let down this was. Reply LOL says March 12 2014 at 149 pm Thanks for giving away every surprise celeb cameo in your credits bit.
