Having made his pile with the mega-hit Pirates of the Caribbean now he gets all self-consciously arty with this serio-comic portrait of a fortysomething male in a tail-spin because hes fabulously over-paid for his undemanding job. Hey we should all have such problems but Nicolas Cage works wonders in balancing sad-eyed gloom with self-abasing humour as a Chicago TV weather man (he doesnt do the forecasting just waves his arms in front of the autocue) mired in depression as he edges closer to an even heftier payday on a national breakfast slot. Its all a veritable acme of superficiality beside the Pulitzer-winning achievements of his ailing novelist father (Michael Caine). Meanwhile his estranged spouse is remarrying his teenage son has drugs problems and his younger daughters morosely overweight.Unsurprisingly the films marketing is playing up the laughter angle (chortle as passers-by repeatedly throw food at that wanker from the telly) but basically this is an extended love-me-love-me bleat the exaggerated contrivances of which merely obscure whatever uncomfortable truths might lie beneath. Perhaps an Alexander Payne could have made something of it but only by planing off the accumulated layers of caricature to get at the quiet desperation inside. Still credits due here a nod for the semblance of ambition in even broaching some fairly fundamental issues while Cage is remarkably game in the circumstances and Caine as ever is a model of unforced accomplishment. And its central question is truly one for our times if youre aware of your own shallowness does that mean youre still shallow?

"Weather Man The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; weather-man-the ) Weather Man The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Reaction to The Weather Man may depend upon an individuals ability to tolerate spending 100 minutes in the company of an unpleasant protagonist. Theres no doubt this can be an uncomfortable experience but it can also be rewarding for those who are willing to endure the discomfort. The Weather Man is a meticulously developed character piece about a man whose personal life is in crisis while his professional life is soaring. If you dont believe in the axiom that ""success cant buy happiness"" director Gore Verbinski is using this opportunity to convince you otherwise. The only negative in evidence is an unnecessarily verbose and sometimes intrusive voiceover by Nicolas Cage. Half of what he says could be eliminated without doing any damage to the story. Motion pictures dont have a high opinion of weather men. From the cynical opportunist played by Bill Murray in Groundhog Day to the vacuum headed character essayed by Steve Carell in Anchorman on-air meteorologists are targets for satire and derision. The Weather Man doesnt really change that but at least it takes its subject and subject matter seriously. David Spritz (Cage) the pride of Chicagos Channel 6 is as clueless about where the winds are blowing his personal life as he is about where they are blowing the next storm system. By his own admission David only has a job - and a chance at a position on a national morning show - because he knows how to work a green screen. Other talents such as the ability to accurately predict the weather are irrelevant. If you watch the local news you know the kind of weatherguy David is a personality without a meteorology degree he takes credit for the good predictions and distances himself from the bad ones. Maybe thats why people throw things at him (fast food sodas) when they see him on the street. The networks love him which is odd because he cant stand himself. A warning to those who dont like movies that indulge a characters self-pity The Weather Man isnt for you. Because the movie is presented from Davids point-of-view and he has a low opinion of himself this turns into a feel-bad experience. But its never uninteresting. Thats because the characters irrespective of being flawed are complex and the acting is strong. Plenty of movies offer uplifting plotlines. Its refreshing to find one that doesnt feel the need to conform (although one could make the case that it offers an optimistic conclusion). Davids marriage has collapsed. His kids have problems - Mike (Nicholas Hoult) is fresh out of rehab for drug addiction and Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pena) lacks self-esteem - and his inability to trust torpedoes his slim chance of reconnecting with his ex-wife Noreen (Hope Davis). Meanwhile his famous father Robert (Michael Caine) is dying of lymphoma. Cancer it seems doesnt spare those who have won the Pulitzer Prize. When it comes time to deliver a eulogy at Roberts ""living funeral"" (a gathering that occurs while a terminally ill individual is still alive) he gets no further than mentioning Bob Segers ""Like a Rock"" before the power goes out. It is to Verbinski and screenwriter Steve Conrads credit that they avoid the temptation to soften the edges of Davids character. Making him more likeable would have turned The Weather Man into a mushy melodrama. The films central conceit - that a mans professional and personal lives can be moving in opposite directions - would have been blunted. Plus its not as if David lacks redeeming qualities. He cares about his children and craves his fathers love and respect (which he never gets). Hes just unlucky and has a talent for saying or doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. Compared to Cages character in Leaving Las Vegas David is a teddy bear. At times The Weather Man shows a propensity for black humor. Most of the jokes arent laugh-aloud funny but they are incisive. The screenplay is smarter than some viewers will give it credit for and its hard to find fault with the actors. Cage is a popular whipping boy for critics but he nails Davids hang-dog mood and successfully transforms him into a charismatic personality when the red light of the camera is on. The only thing wrong with Michael Caine is that he never sounds quite right with an American accent. Taking a break between installments of his Pirates of the Caribbean franchise Verbinski has given us a small thoughtful motion picture whose persistent negativity may make it a difficult sell for mainstream audiences.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post David Spritz is wading aimlessly around the shallow end of his life. He hopes theres a deep end. But even if there is he has no idea if he can swim. Many movies try to capture this poignant state of melancholy then panic at the difficulty and move instead toward slapstick or cruelty. ""Bruce Almighty"" successfully went for comedy while ""As Good as It Gets"" made a more disturbing lunge for meanness. What director Gore Verbinski deserves great credit for in ""The Weather Man"" is staying true to his mood. And to the melancholy of writer Steven Conrad. And to the crackling restraint of star Nicolas Cage. For ""The Weather Man"" succeeds where so few Hollywood movies even venture - it builds a believable life adds just enough nervous laughter to relieve the realistic tension and constantly escapes the dumbed-down expectations beaten into us by lesser films. Tragicomedy is that extra dose of tang in the bittersweet teetering between hopeful and hopeless well after the last reel pays out. And ""The Weather Man"" upholds the fine and scarcely populated tradition of the genre. As Spritz Cage is admirable for being barely likable. He makes a quarter of a million dollars a year for doing nearly nothing as a Chicago TV weatherman. (Today Wind and sleet. Tomorrow Wind and ... you get the idea.) Of course this uniquely American bounty must come with a heaping helping of another Chicago export - Oprah-style self-awareness. Spritz would be happily married if it werent for the small matter of his divorce. He would have an ideal family if only one child werent a reprobate and the other overweight and morose. He would enjoy the wisdom of his elders if his unassailable father (Michael Caine) hadnt ruined Daves confidence by winning the National Book Award before Dave was even born. Every few months Dave notes somebody on the street throws something at him. It makes perfect sense. Hes the weather guy - he either gets it wrong or gets it right and gets paid too much for being banal. So he deserves a chocolate frosty on the neck or a hot apple pie on the lapel. But he doesnt have to be happy about it. The Verbinski and Conrad observations of everyday modern life are always precise and never irrelevant. The way it hurts more to get hit by a Big Gulp than a generic drink. The way modern parents are driven crazy by their childrens indifference to suggested hobbies or family projects. The way we might reach for a playful moment with a former spouse by throwing a snowball and when it accidentally hits her in the face we might defend ourselves by remarking ""You turned into it."" I heard someone leaving the film saying ""I kept expecting Cage to go climb the snipers tower."" But he doesnt quite. Going nuts like that would be too obvious too much like some other film that ""The Weather Man"" strives so hard not to imitate. Pause for a minute to appreciate Verbinskis impressive range. After muddled starts in ""The Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Mexican"" he crafted one of the most chilling movies of his generation in ""The Ring."" He then turned a Disney theme park ride into a pitch-perfect adventure in ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Here he guides Cage and Caine to the right groove for reflection and possible growth stepping over the traps of the maudlin and the facile. ""The Weather Man"" will struggle to find an audience with so many of us seeking easier laughs or more sympathetic tragedy after a long week at work. But go - take a beach chair and take an umbrella in case The Spritz gets it wrong and enjoy whatever weather comes your way.

Braving the elements Nicolas Cage plays a weatherman who cant seem to tell which way the wind is blowing in his life. Paramount Pictures But you will not find anything akin to the splashy showmanship Al Roker displayed on NBCs Today show this week when he took an on-air tumble while reporting outdoors on Hurricane Wilma. This is one glum outing with occasional pings of wry wit and hearty chuckles. As a comic hero Cages character is somewhat reminiscent of the late comic Jackie Vernons ""Dull Guy"" public persona. Vernon used to talk about his idea of excitement going to a department store and trying on loud ties. Cages mopey character works in a Chicago where in the few scenes in which we do see some sun its shining in the puddles and slush from the snow that fills the screen. About the movie The Weather Man   1/2 (out of four) Stars Nicolas Cage Michael Caine Hope Davis Gemmenne de la Pena Nicholas Hoult Gil Bellows Director Gore Verbinski Distributor Paramount Rating R for strong language and sexual content Running time 1 hour 41 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The good cheer continues. Cages writer father (Michael Caine) is getting progressively worse health reports from his doctor. An estranged wife (Hope Davis sympathetically making the case for her incompatibility with Cage) has a new squeeze. Cages adolescent son has a rehab counselor who asks to snap photos of him shirtless. A younger daughter is squat and overweight and her classmates refer to her by a very rude name. Cages professional quandary should his long-shot audition pay off is whether to change venues to a national slot on Bryant Gumbels New York-based Hello America show. The alternative is to remain in Chicago where kinder viewers invade his space by coming up and calling him ""Bro"" -- and more prevalent louts in a funny motif pelt him on the street with fast-food gunk from moving cars. Gore Verbinski isnt an easy director to peg (try The Mexican followed by Pirates of the Caribbean) but he seems to have made the movie he wanted. Theres a calculated tone of consistently low-key comic despair which is saved from a tendency toward monotony only by out-of-the-blue laughs both verbal and visual. (Even SpongeBob gets into the act.) Cage whos excellent was a sad case in Matchstick Men as well but that underrated career high had the advantage of being a dynamic movie. This is a movie you might be able to put up with if youre in a certain mood or be put off by if youre not. Either way the forecast is ""Beware of cloud cover.""

(AP Photo/ Paramount Pictures/Melinda Sue Gordon) less In this photo provided by Paramount Pictures Popular TV weatherman David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is on top of the world professionally but his personal life is falling apart in ""The Weather Man."" (AP Photo/ ... more Photo Paramount Pictures A weather forecaster rides out his inner storm 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Weather Man Black comedy. Starring Nicolas Cage Michael Caine and Hope Davis. Directed by Gore Verbinski. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When a movie is in limbo for nine months after its scheduled release you dont need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows. Now that ""The Weather Man"" finally is blowing into theaters the reason for the delay becomes apparent. Its an oddity a big-budget feature with the sensibility of an indie. The film has a lot of rough edges. But it works as an intriguingly offbeat character study while offering Nicolas Cage a chance to show why he used to be considered one of the top actors of his generation. TV promos showing Cage getting pelted with gooey fast food make ""The Weather Man"" look like a comedy. There are funny moments; the humor is decidedly black. Its no kin of ""Anchorman."" Wearing a wig with the suggestion of bangs and a continual hangdog expression Cage plays a Chicago forecaster who compensates for his lack of a meteorology degree with graceful on-air motions. David Spritz -- he made up the last name to fit the gig -- is the Fred Astaire of weathermen. Nevertheless some of his audience is hostile. Hence the occasional burrito or apple pie hurled at him as he walks around downtown. From these glimpses of David dwarfed by Chicagos legendary skyscrapers to a breathtaking view of a frozen-over Lake Michigan the Second City becomes a secondary character giving ""The Weather Man"" a sense of place too often missing in movies. Given to philosophical ruminations heard in voice-over David ponders that pies are thrown at clowns not serious people. In the latter category is his father (a subdued Michael Caine) a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist whom David is consumed with trying to impress. One failed marriage and two troubled kids have had the opposite effect leaving David to count on a job feeler from a national morning show to boost his own inner respect and his fathers esteem for him. Davids private thoughts from the petty to the almost profound come out in his internal monologue. Fortunately Cage has a pleasing voice because you hear an awful lot of it. Hes good at capturing Davids usually unsuccessful attempts to control his anger -- you can practically hear him count to 10 -- at the way things are turning out. Much of the rage is directed at his former wifes new boyfriend. Hope Davis shines as his ex methodically enumerating her reasons for hating David and quelling his hope that they reconcile. Screenwriter Steven Conrad largely unheard from since his underrated ""Wrestling Ernest Hemingway"" a dozen years ago has come up with a smart script that has something to say about accepting who you are instead of daydreaming about who youd like to be. The films biggest problem is that like David its a lot of talk. Luckily Gore Verbinski a director known for his visual style signed on following his success with ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" He gives us much to look at while we listen. A scene of Davids adolescent daughter picking out a new grown-up wardrobe plays like a virtual fashion show and once David becomes enamored with archery as a hobby the visual effects are enhanced. To complement Davids mood Chicago is shown looking relentlessly overcast and bleak. Theres plenty of weather all of it bad. Professional weathermen and women are sure to be displeased when David admits that he mostly reads off a teleprompter. As he puts it you cant really predict the weather because its just wind. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and sexual content.

"Cage winningly weathers his crisis but narration is a torrential downer - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Life Cage winningly weathers his crisis but narration is a torrential downermovies - reviewOctober 28 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticThe definition of ""midlife crisis"" must be the day that it all stops making sense.The rules you were playing by feel wrong.The goals you set seem out of whack. Especially if youve reached them.The life you might have led becomes the life youre leading and no matter how many yardsticks tell you its all good -- youre a success -- you know what you do has no consequence.The Weather Man is an engaging meditation on a man cursed with that midlife self-awareness. Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) has the cute TV-weather-guy name which he changed. Hes a maestro of the blue screen utterly at home standing in front of a blank wall pointing into space and communicating whether we need an umbrella in the morning.Not that he knows.""Its all just . . . wind.""Heck hes not even a licensed meteorologist.But hes a major-market weather guy in Chicago. Hes making 240000 a year and earning interest from Bryant Gumbels national morning show. Why isnt he happy?Well hes the son of a famous writer (Michael Caine) so whatever he does is always going to be judged as beneath him. Hes divorced and cant get along with his ex-wife (Hope Davis) despite his fondest hopes for a reconciliation. And hes very slow to see how his chubby daughter and rebellious son (Gemmenne de la Pena Nicholas Hoult) are making poor choices and headed for disaster.This is Sideways with none of the wine and all the whine. Daves unfocused futility comes from the juggling act that is modern life. Were all so overscheduled that details are missed. Weve acted on childish impulse taken the easy way out too many times.""Easy doesnt enter into grown-up life"" Daves dad tells him. Dave is just starting to understand.Cage is the best in the business at playing this particular brand of put-upon frustration. He doesnt even need to do his classic slow-burn or meltdown any more. Weve seen it so often that when Daves little indignities -- ""fans"" are forever pelting him with fast food -- and life mistakes pile up we know whats to come and we can enjoy imagining what shade of red his face will be.Theres real wit and pathos here and no easy laughs. Dave wants to know more to ""knuckle down"" and make this or that aspect of his world work. Director Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean The Ring) puzzles over Daves problems along with us.The movies suggested solution to midlife ennui is really no different from the one in City Slickers. Remember Jack Palance holding up a finger and saying life was just ""one thing"" figuring out what matters and letting the rest slide? Michael Caine has that moment here.There are nice little epiphanies on an archery range at the food court. But Steve Conrad who scripted Wrestling Ernest Hemingway built a serious handicap into his movie. Daves omnipresent voice-over narration a stream-of-consciousness interior monologue ranges from cute to cloying to downright maddening.The Weather Man isnt quite the new face of quiet desperation. But if the ""angry white male"" has devolved into the whiney one Cage is the perfect guy to tell us which way the wind blows.

"In Weather Man little chance of emotion - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In Weather Man little chance of emotion By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 28 2005 The Weather Man"" finds Nicolas Cage in a self-pitying mood. In the past this would have been happy news. Cage in a funk was good for Leaving Las Vegas"" and Adaptation."" Even in a movie as imbalanced as Martin Scorseses Bringing Out the Dead"" Cages depression soulfully complemented Scorseses mania. Those movies gave Cage an opportunity to be inventive and inspired. The Weather Man"" gives him license to drift for nearly two hours like a parade float.Cage plays a Chicago TV weatherman who mopes from one scene to the next in a fog of depression. His name Dave Spritz sounds heckle-worthy. Daves ex-wife Noreen (Hope Davis) is annoyed with him. His father (Michael Caine) is an award-winning author whos never supported him. His teenage daughter Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pena) is overweight (a crime in the movies). His son (Nicholas Hoult) misbehaves. And when viewers -- irate over Daves inaccurate forecasts -- spot him trudging down the street they chuck things at him milkshakes soda chicken nuggets. Were The Weather Man"" purely abut Daves random victimization and the catharsis people feel in harassing him the movie would have touched on a weirdly unique cultural phenomenon.But Dave also has to deal with bad family news. Papa Spritz is dying and Noreen is seeing someone new. Dave doesnt do much about these developments. He drives his father to the doctor. He enrolls Shelly in an archery class that he winds up taking instead. He sits around with a blank look on his face.Dave is one of the most ineffectual characters ever to have an entire movie built around him. It looked like the trend of crippling anomie in immature American men (better known as emo"") had reached its watershed at the movies with Garden State"" and died with Elizabethtown."" Now its infecting wildly successful middle-age men like Dave.The film takes too many of its cues from Daves depression. As it slogs on the movies cloudiness starts to feel funereal which is odd since writer Steven Conrad aims for comedy possibly even satire. The very best dialogue is vulgar as when Noreen explains to Dave why she was such a monotonous sex partner for the duration of their marriage. That encounter feels bracing because someone is actually being honest with Dave. Davis is good in these reality-check parts having played versions of them in About Schmidt"" and Proof."" I just worry that her indelicacy however necessary it is will turn audiences against her.But The Weather Man"" needs more of her exasperation. The movie finds Daves malaise bittersweet and ironic. Never mind that hes a sad sack off the air. His career rises anyway like a let-go party balloon He gets a job offer to do the weather on a national show that Bryant Gumbel hosts.Throughout The Weather Man"" you wait for director Gore Verbinski (The Ring"" Pirates of the Caribbean"") to fill the movies exquisite framing with the emotional or psychological equivalent of Phedon Papamichaels (Sideways"") cinematography. Instead we get a vague movie that a few successful but chronically dissatisfied men will be able to call their own. The rest of us will see the film for what it is a long cold mumble from the heart.

Now we have a new candidate for most metaphorical job description. In the uneven bittersweet ""The Weather Man"" Nicolas Cage plays David Spritz (shortened from Spritzel) a forecaster for a top-rated Chicago TV show.Its clear from the moment we first see him staring glumly into the bathroom mirror that this sad sack carries the weight of the world on his stooped shoulders.On camera his most inclement winter forecasts are delivered with a socko smile - he wants his viewers to know that were all in this together. Away from the camera though hes isolated from affection. His marriage to Noreen (Hope Davis) has come apart his teenage son Mike (Nicholas Hoult) is in counseling and his daughter Shelley (Gemmene de la Pena) is sullen and overweight. His father Robert (a first-rate Michael Caine) a famous novelist is condescending. ""You dont have a degree in meteorology"" he reminds David. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Nothing goes right for the weather man not even the weather. When his predictions are off which is often his audience takes it personally. Throughout the film David is periodically pelted by people in cars heaving frosties and fast food as he walks the city sidewalks. He is a peculiar species of celebrity people feel privileged to needle him in person. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Steven Conrad are too enamored of their metaphorical conceit; they never waste an opportunity to point out how zonked and bedraggled poor David has become. Yes its true Life like the weather is unpredictable. As Robert says to his son "" Easy doesnt enter into grown-up life."" But is this really such a startling revelation? David is made a target for all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. (Maybe this is why he takes up archery.) He cant even toss a friendly snowball at his wife without accidentally popping her in the eye.If anybody but Nicolas Cage were the star of this movie it would be a big dose of blah. But as he demonstrated most recently in ""Adaptation"" Cage has no peer when it comes to bringing out the emotional nuances in morose characters and making them funny - and touching.In Davids scenes with Noreen we can see how avidly he wants to get back with her and how hemmed in he is by his own inadequacies. When he confronts her boyfriend he loses control and sputters obscenities and we dont dislike him for it because he cares deeply about his family - more perhaps than they care about him. He tries to do right by everyone even as hes coming apart.The filmmakers arent content to confine Davids funk to his personal circumstances. They want to show us that he is a victim of a larger malaise - the culture of celebrity. By materialistic standards he is a huge success and the offer of a network job in New York ought to make him happy. But David is uncomfortable with wealth - this is why despite everything he comes across so sympathetically. The blandishments of success mean nothing unless they get him his family back. ""The Weather Man"" is about the meaninglessness of celebrity. David is a star but all he does is read the weather report. Stardom in the movies terms is a sick joke. It does nothing to insulate David from himself.The film is certainly worth seeing but it should be better than it is. David is a credible Everyman but he isnt allowed to break out of his sad trance. The filmmakers equate that trance with soulfulness. No doubt they believe they have created a modern archetype - the sensitive soul who is too frail for this crass world. But what they have concocted more often resembles a sacrificial zombie. Grade B Rated R for strong language and sexual content.

Show me a reasonably contented emotionally mature fellow with satisfying ties to family and community and Ill show you a guy who has probably never toyed with producing a screenplay influenced by Garden State In the Company of Men Happiness or American Beauty. By now the indie cinema of anomie disappointment and stifled rage is such a familiar genre that within two minutes of affectless voice-over and establishing shots of dead-eyed Americans drinking Big Gulps we know everything we need to know about the contemporary quagmire in question except perhaps which route of indecision and eccentric behavior the antihero will follow on his path to accepting that for grown-ups life sometimes sucks. The Weather Man is what indie misery looks like when re-created by one of Hollywoods big studios The emotional visibility is atmospherically limited but the job of making a muted intimate picture has been given to Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski whose instinct is to make something big and the opposite of ruminative. Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) the sad sack with the title job is a Chicago TV personality whose earliest misery was no doubt some dumb joke about the surname he inherited from his forebears. Actually the family name is Spritzel proudly carried by his father Robert (Michael Caine) a prize-winning author. Spritz is what happened to Dave when he became a talking head He knows how to sparkle in front of the camera but he fizzles off screen every day of his life. Dave is dazedly related to an irritated ex-wife (Hope Davis) an overweight and unhappy daughter (Gemmenne De la Pena from Erin Brockovich) and a teenage son (About a Boys Nicholas Hoult growing up nicely) who while kicking drug problems cant distinguish between kindness and predatory sexual interest from his counselor (Gil Bellows). And then theres Daves father who conveys a sense of lifelong disappointment with his son. Robert affects a tyrannically prissy ignorance of the pop culture in which Dave has achieved a middling measure of success. And in response Dave has until now preferred emotional stupidity and interior blankness to self-awareness. But now Robert has announced that hes dying. Daves ex has announced that shes remarrying. Daves daughter hasnt announced anything but the inappropriately unflattering clothing she wears screams self-loathing. And Dave with a shot at a high-visibility job at a fictional morning show very much like Today -- Bryant Gumbel even plays himself as the Hello America anchor -- must decide whether its okay to be...Dave sometimes disappointing or disappointed sometimes clumsy or foolish and sometimes a disposable celebrity who gets pelted with junk food by strangers -- but sometimes too just a decent well-paid reasonably appreciated lucky SOB. Now is as good a time as any to mention that in contemplating his own stasis Dave takes up archery one of those metaphor-laden activities with hits misses and bulls-eyes so beloved by writers and embraced by cinematographers partial to long shots of lone archers taking aim at outdoor ranges against wintry skies. The Weather Man luxuriates in its own decorative dreariness -- the oppressiveness of malls traffic TV studios doctors waiting rooms Chicago weather -- but it enjoys its own words even more; the movie is an illustrated short story rather than a discrete cinematic invention. And the imbalance influences every performance. Cage uses the dampened inside voice he perfected for Adaptation -- so defeated so in denial of feelings -- but the tonelessness only serves to expose the self-consciousness of the dialogue and deadened voice-over in Steven Conrads screenplay. Given no direction about who the ex-wife is -- the women in this picture including Daves mother and daughter are placeholders not people -- Davis can only produce a standard-issue approximation of a once-loving wife who has lost interest in understanding her former mates neuroses. Even Caine a wily vet gives up on defining the implacable father he plays. ""Thats quite an American accomplishment"" he says coolly proffering wound and compliment in the same breath as he congratulates his son on the glitzy new TV job. But the reasons for Roberts snobbery his hauteur his own disappointment in ""this s-- life"" are never defined. In The Weather Man the forecast is a never-ending hail of lifes crap. But theres no compelling reason to believe the messenger. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Aiming for an Alexander Payne-style synthesis of wry comedy and unflinching character study pic has been made with the utmost sincerity but the frankly lugubrious material and barely compensating spasms of humor are all but impossible to warm to. One of the biggest downers to emerge from a major studio in recent memory ""The Weather Man"" is an overbearingly glum look at a Chicago celebrity combing through the emotional wreckage of his life. Aiming for an Alexander Payne-style synthesis of wry comedy and unflinching character study pic has been made with the utmost sincerity but the frankly lugubrious material and barely compensating spasms of humor are all but impossible to warm to spelling an uncertain B.O. forecast for Paramount. Uncertainty itself is one of the driving themes of Steven Conrads script which treats its protags vocation as a blunt metaphor for the often cruel and unpredictable nature of fate. At first glance fortune would seem to have smiled on David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) a successful Chicago weather reporter whos in the running for an even more prestigious job at Gotham-based morning show ""Hello America"" (hosted in an odd cameo by Bryant Gumbel). As weather men go though Dave has more lows than highs. Hes constantly struggling to win the approval of his father Robert (Michael Caine) a dour Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist whose literary gifts appear to have bypassed his son. Dave also tries in vain to repair his relationship with ex-wife Noreen (Hope Davis) whos started dating another man (Michael Rispoli) and to reconnect with their two children. Absent any real connection to his dad son Mike (""About a Boys"" Nicholas Hoult) ends up getting closer than he should to a creepy counselor (Gil Bellows). Meanwhile overweight daughter Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pena) who casually smokes when no ones looking sullenly rebuffs her dads efforts to reach out to her by taking her ice-skating or teaching her archery. The dynamic here -- famous father plus-size daughter -- at times suggests a simpler and more benign version of the relationship depicted in Agnes Jaouis superb French-language ""Look at Me."" But where that film wisely refracted its storytelling through multiple perspectives helmer Gore Verbinski insists on digging solely into Daves head which turns out to be a singularly unrewarding place to spend 100 minutes. It would take a filmmaker of a certain sardonic temperament i.e. Payne (""About Spritz"" anyone?) to wring both laughter and tears from this scenario and the filmmakers here ultimately are not up to the challenge. Cage sporting one of his least flattering haircuts makes Dave a writhing mass of insecurities who in his own words ""cant knuckle down."" His Dave is by turns feckless absent-minded and intensely irritable capable of extreme profanity and even physical violence when provoked. To Cages credit its a warts-and-all perf completely stripped of vanity. But theres something crushingly over-deliberate even suffocating about the ways the pic chooses to wallow in the characters misery especially the nonstop voiceover -- essentially a plea for sympathy that becomes more distancing every time its used. In the most tiresome (and heavily marketed) running gag Daves local celebrity status has made him a figure of perpetual scorn on the streets as drivers regularly heave sodas shakes and other fast-food products at him out of their car windows. Gag constitutes either a revelatory look at the downside of fame or the most organic use of product placement in some time. As a woman trying to stay on good terms with her ex while maintaining a firm emotional distance the ever-terrific Davis has an invigoratingly tonic effect on the proceedings. Its a refreshingly self-assured characterization that in some ways stands in for the audience as a direct rebuke to Daves frumpy sad sack. Caines gloomy turn as Robert is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the picture though he does eventually let down his guard -- and delivers the films key line -- with typical grace and understatement. As Daves mother Judith McConnell has so few scenes its a wonder she wasnt written out. Verbinski on reprieve from the swirling acrobatics of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise works overtime to sustain a depressive low-key mood and rhythm while Hans Zimmers score provides a jangly percussive echo of the protags neuroses. Making the most of pics Windy City locales Phedon Papamichaels impressively bleak wind-chilled lensing is enough to give viewers frostbite.
