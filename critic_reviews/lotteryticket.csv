Advocacy to the point of propaganda ""The Lottery"" takes on this years documentary topic of choice -- education -- and creates a virtual PSA for charter schools in general and New Yorks celebrated Harlem Success Academies in particular. Theres no lack of drama in helmer Madeleine Sacklers character-rich docu despite its conventional structure The statistics are dire the reformed schools perform miracles and childrens destinies ride on a figurative roll of the dice. But despite the universality of its subject ""The Lottery"" is a tale lopsidedly told. Exposure including a theatrical tour that kicked off June 11 in Gotham will be limited. Its hard to fault a film that campaigns on behalf of children especially children as ill-served as the ones trapped in the New York school system depicted here. In the citys entrenched bureaucracy -- portrayed as the Frankenstein monster of collective bargaining -- two factors predominate the teachers union and race. Fifty-eight percent of black fourth graders are illiterate were told (just one of the many troubling figures). And in 2008 the year in which the film takes place only 10 out of 55000 tenured teachers were fired. Given the first factor the second seems ludicrous but as one educator explains the 600-page teachers contract is the controlling document for the city school day and firing a bad teacher ends up costing the city 250000. The result stasis. So its no surprise that the Harlem Success Academies with their sterling record of academic achievement attract 3000 applicants for the 475 places available. Its an imbalance that forces the lottery of the title in which some hearts will sing and others will be broken. As in Davis Guggenheims upcoming (and far better more balanced) ""Waiting for Superman"" we meet a selection of tiny scholars-in-waiting and the anxious parents peering over their shoulders. As your mom used to say someones going to get hurt. Sackler also gives us mini-profiles in courage among the crusaders for reform notably of Eva Moskowitz founder and CEO of the umbrella Success Charter Networks. Possessed of an uncannily even temperament and sharp intelligence Moskowitz has to deal with stupidity corruption community resistance to whats perceived as the gentrifying influence of her schools and in some cases pure racism Appearing before the New York City Council shes practically asked to apologize for being a white woman living in Harlem. But Sackler is so obviously on Moskowitzs side and assumes we are too that she neglects to explain what political concerns (such as union support) are motivating Moskowitzs enemies (none of whom are interviewed here); nor does the director clearly explain other issues that come to the fore. An attempt by the overcrowded Success schools to take over an underpopulated Harlem school building is met with fierce resistance during a public meeting with some of the anti-Success crowd virtually foaming at the mouth. (You want their children if they have any taken away immediately.) Its unclear what their point is or whether they even have one. The sentiments of ""The Lottery"" are so obviously skewed toward the Harlem Success version of educational reform that you start to question everything -- which is too bad because the charter-school advocates are clearly devoted to fixing something thats obviously broken. Sackler thinks they need a lot of help but they probably need less than she provides. Production values are first-rate notably the work of d.p. Wolfgang Held.

Lottery Ticket (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Lottery Ticket (PG-13) Without Bow Wows solid performance Lottery Ticket would be just a series of silly cameo appearances. Bow Wow stars as Kevin Carson. (Warner Bros.) Share Print Save to your profile By Rick Bentley McClatchy News Service8/18/2010 Editor rating 2.5 Lottery Ticket isnt the mega ball of outrageous comedy but its still a winner because of the way director Erik White blends comic lunacy with sweet sentimentality. Kevin (Bow Wow) a young man living with his grandmother in the projects is suddenly 370 million richer when he wins a nationwide lottery. His moment of bliss turns into trouble as family friends and criminals all want a piece of the prize. Bow Wows been working in TV and films for several years but this is the first time hes shown real acting skills as the good-hearted Kevin. Hes equally believable as a devoted grandson and a hormone-driven teen. Without his solid performance Lottery Ticket would be just a series of silly cameo appearances. Hes especially good in scenes with Brandon T. Jackson who plays Kevins best friend. Theyre fun to watch as they run from the greedy and share real emotion on a lonely rooftop. The lunacy comes from a first-rate ensemble cast that includes Mike Epps T-Pain Keith David Charlie Murphy Gbenga Akinnagbe Terry Crews and Loretta Devine. Crews is particularly funny as a not-so-tough tough guy but all -- from serious actors to stand-up comedians -- get a chance to shine. The director smartly uses Ice Cube for the films most sobering moments. Ice Cubes portrayal of a broken-down boxer creates a sweet undertone for Lottery Ticket. Cast Bow Wow Ice Cube Brandon T. Jackson Mike Epps T-Pain Keith David Charlie Murphy. Director Erik White. Screenwriter Abdul Williams. Based on a story by Erik White and Abdul Williams. Producers Matt Alvarez Mark Burg Broderick Johnson Andrew A. Kosove. A Warner Bros. Pictures release. Crude humor language. Running time 99 minutes.

Comments Lottery Ticket Video Rated PG-13  99 minutes  2010 A sneaker-obsessed recent high school grad (played by former child rapper Bow Wow--hes dropped the ""Lil"") has just won a 370 million lottery jackpot. When his grandma inadvertently lets the news slip everyone in his neighborhood project wants a piece of the action. First-time director Erik White keeps things moving briskly when hes not bogged down with life lessons for his young protagonist in this otherwise standard comic fare. Bow Wow is earnest if unremarkable in the lead and the supporting cast brings some gusto to the film. No doubt the characters are stereotypes but the performances are handled with a knowing wink and a great deal of fun--particularly Mike Epps who shines as a hammy Little Richard-style preacher.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Lottery Ticket amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Piranha 3D The Switch >> Lottery Ticket Whats worse than winning a 370 million jackpot? Everything. But for Bow Wow whats truly terrible is having to protect your uncashed prize for three days in the projects where everyone knows your business and half of everyone has a gun. (Grandma Loretta Devine immediately douses him in holy water.) This broad comedy by Erik White and co-written by Abdul Williams is populated with a crammed city block of goons hotties gossips and opportunists. Even before Bow Wow wins the golden ticket just cutting through the hood to get to his job at Foot Locker is a gauntlet where everybodys gotta holler at him to steal some Air Jordans. ""The lottery is designed to keep poor people poor"" Bow Wow speechifies before he gives in and buys a ticket. And under the surface of this very superficial flick is an indictment of a culture where everyones taking shortcuts that lead to dead ends and the neighborhood beauty (Teairra Mari) has boned Jay-Z LeBron and Bill Cosby in the hopes of a rich baby daddy. (Here the way you can tell a good girl from a hustler is she insists on a condom.)  Even the preacher (Mike Epps) thinks hes entitled to a cathedral a mansion and a trophy wife. But while therere enough stereotypes in here to get Dr. Laura frothing at the mouth theres also enough menace to merit co-writing credit for the Hughes brothers.

Jackson as Benny Bow Wow as Kevin Carson and Naturi Naughton as Stacie in Lottery Ticket. Theres a fine art to making a good ""hood"" comedy.You can do it the right way as the makers of ""Friday"" and ""Barbershop"" did years ago with warm humor and realistic characters. Or you can muck it up with stereotypes and tomfoolery like in ""Soul Plane"" and ""All About the Benjamins.""And then theres ""Lottery Ticket"" which falls somewhere in the middle. Its hard to love and hard to hate. Kevin (Bow Wow) is a good guy living with his caring grandmother (Loretta Devine). He works hard at Foot Locker a point thats drilled into our heads so much that some scenes seem like commercials for sneakers.Neighborhood thugs led by ex-con Lorenzo (Gbenga Akinnagbe) attempt to steal sneakers under Kevins watch leading to his unfair termination.Hes out of a job but hes not hurting for long. After playing the lottery using the numbers from a fortune cookie he wins the 370 million jackpot. But its an extended July 4 weekend so he has to wait until Tuesday to claim his prize.That means hes not only responsible for holding on to the ticket all weekend but he also has to keep everyone else from finding out about his fortune. Kevin shares the news with his grandmother and his best friend Benny (Brandon T. Jackson) and within minutes the entire hood is at his door looking for a handout. Where the story goes from here isnt especially engaging as Kevin encounters all types mostly stereotypes while lessons pour on about money not changing a person as much as the people around you.Theres the loan shark Sweet Tee (Keith David); a curious hermit Mr. Washington (Ice Cube); a shady preacher Reverend Taylor (Mike Epps); and others angling to benefit from Kevins payday.It all comes off a bit like an extended episode of ""Everybody Hates Chris"" with really bad language.Ice Cube who starred in ""Friday"" and ""Barbershop"" executive produced ""Lottery Ticket"" and some of the warmth and feeling from those films carries over though not enough. This one isnt in the same league. Related Links Showtimes for Lottery Ticket Tags Lottery Ticket Bow Wow Ice Cube Loretta Devine Kevin C.

Jackson Naturi Naughton Keith David Charles Q. Murphy Loretta Devine Terry Crews Director Erik White Running time 135 Release Opened Aug 20 2010  Editorial Review This comedy fails to cash inBy Stephanie MerryFriday August 20 2010Normally a three-day weekend that feels never-ending is cause for celebration. But in the case of the urban comedy ""Lottery Ticket"" a few days can be a long time for the main character -- and for the audience. A long Fourth of July weekend is all that stands between recent high school graduate Kevin (played by rapper Bow Wow) and a 370 million jackpot. Owner of the winning ticket Kevin can claim his prize once the next workday begins but until then he has to contend with the other inhabitants of his housing project including a gold digger a muscly ex-con and a wealth of questionably intentioned friends. ""Do you know what could happen in three whole days?"" Kevin wonders. The answer is a jumble of comedy and drama with a sprinkling of ""After School Special"" messaging and some head-scratchingly bad choices. Most people in such a quandary would perhaps hide in a closet at a friends house. But writers Erik White (who also directs) and Abdul Williams have the young man make decisions far beyond the potential for suspended disbelief. Disclosing his new wealth to the whole neighborhood? Check. Taking money from a loan shark with a brigade of Bentleys in a dark warehouse? Check. Getting busy with an unabashed gold digger who wants to be his ""baby mama""? (""This is my lottery ticket"" she claims gesturing to her partially disrobed brick house of a body.) Gross and yes check. Despite the many uneven moments there are some bright spots. Bow Wow has surprisingly good comic timing especially when said man-eater begins aggressively seducing him under a mirrored ceiling. A scene with a fancy-footed and opportunistic preacher (Mike Epps) proves especially memorable as the man fondles his long silky hair while narrating a slide show of the things God wants him to have including a nicer church a mansion that screams Miami and a young hot wife. Most unexpected of all is Faheem Najms (a.k.a. rapper T-Pain) brief and infectiously amusing portrayal of a liquor store clerk. It would seem the Grammy winner has talents beyond singing ""Im N Luv (Wit a Stripper)."" But things really slow down during the movies ill-advised forays into drama. When a curious old man living in a cellar (played by Ice Cube) discusses his past as a sparring partner for some of boxings greatest legends resplendent music begins to soar before he declares ""I just wish someone would come along and make a difference."" He might as well have screamed ""This is foreshadowing."" When Kevin gets into a fight with his best friend the pair hams it up to the point of Oscar clip territory and Kevins behavior starts to look an awful lot like Frodos buckling under the weight of the ring. In the end this three-day weekend takes up little more than an hour and a half but it might be a holiday worth skipping.Contains sexual content language including a drug reference violence and brief underage drinking.

Bow Wow (no longer Lil except in acting ability) plays Kevin a polite and hard-working high school graduate who is so earnest about his job at the local Foot Locker that he irons his shoelaces. Buying a lottery ticket for his grandma he decides on a whim to be free-spirited like his best friend Benny (Brandon T. Jackson) and get one for himself. Kevins grandmothers ticket misses. Kevins hits. Now that Kevins 370 million richer on paper he must elude violent thugs while keeping track of the ticket over a three-day Fourth of July weekend until he can cash it in on Tuesday morning. The script cant figure out in which direction to go so it goes in all of them staggering from cornball to crude and from silly to sinister. Kevin seems thoughtful (he tells neighbors correctly that lottery tickets are just a means of keeping poor people poor) yet when he wins the lottery he accepts a 100000 cash loan from a local gangster (Keith David). Then he promptly blows the money on junk like a rare pair of Nikes. This is not only shallow but stupid Parading around town with the money (the movie was filmed in Atlanta) only draws unwanted attention to Kevin who has already had a run-in with a ruthless ex-con (Gbenga Akinnagbe). The movie could work if it stuck to one tone and concentrated on Kevins learning to grow up and make the right choices but all of his poor decisions are instead presented as larky fun. Wouldnt it be cool to have a 100000 shopping spree? Even if it may get you killed? Sure whatever. And its not clear Kevin ever changes internally; for instance he nearly sleeps with the local tramp disgusting the good girl (Naturi Naughton) he has never quite managed to start a romance with. But he doesnt walk away from the town tart because he realizes hes made a mistake. He only does it because he thinks shes trying to trick him into getting her pregnant. Ice Cubes well-worn performance as a wise old geezer is the only bright spot in a movie that otherwise fumbles every opportunity to be funny exciting or insightful as it veers from feeble feel-good comedy to thin gangland drama. Says one character ""I need a girl I can take to like church and a strip club."" Like the movie he needs to make up his mind.

(David Lee) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday August 20 2010 400 AM Title Lottery Ticket As a producer Ice Cube has always understood the key to success Youve got to write your own ticket. Hes done exactly that by backing and starring in popular franchises like the ""Friday"" and ""Barbershop"" movies. And its easy to see the potential in ""Lottery Ticket"" which boasts an entertaining idea and a game cast. But you only win big if every number hits.Whats missing in this urban comedy is any actual comedy The predictable story a collaboration between screenwriter Abdul Williams and director Erik White feels too much like an afterthought.Still if youre not looking for big laughs you will find some low-key fun. Most of the credit goes to the actors led by the consistently charming Bow Wow. His Kevin is a recent high-school grad who dreams of starting a sneaker company. For now hes spending the summer at home with his grandma (Loretta Devine) in the Atlanta projects.After unfairly losing his job he reluctantly gives his last dollar to a bodega manager (T-Pain) for a lottery ticket. And what do you know? He wins the 370 million prize. But its not long before local gossip Semaj (Charlie Murphy) spreads the word and everyone from the pastor (Mike Epps) to the neighborhood godfather (Keith David) wants a cut. The only people he can trust are his best friends Benny (Brandon T. Jackson) and Stacie (Naturi Naughton) -- and possibly the strange old man (Ice Cube) in the basement though Bennys convinced hes a serial killer.The setup is there for a younger version of ""Friday"" with raucous characters and amusing misadventures lightened by teen-friendly messages about determination and loyalty. But though the movie looks good and rarely lags on energy the careless script is filled with tired stereotypes and easy cliches. If only White and Williams had listened to their own advice Luck is nice but its hard work that gets you where you need to go.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 20 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Lottery Ticket Directed by Erik White Screenplay by Abdul Williams Starring Bow Wow Brandon T. Jackson Naturi Naughton Ice Cube Loretta Devine Charlie Murphy Gbenga Akinnagbe and Keith David What would you do if you won a 370-million jackpot? Thats the question on everyones mind in the Fillmore Housing Community - everyone except recent high school grad Kevin Carson who on a whim plays what turn out to be the winning numbers in the entertaining if highly predictable escapist ensemble comedy Lottery Ticket. If movies have taught us anything its that sudden fortune can lead to a heap of trouble. Early classics such as Erich von Stroheims masterful Greed (1924) and the Frank Capra favourite Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) set the gold standard. And through the decades ""windfall"" movies have proven reliable vehicles to reveal truths about human nature either through dramas about moral decay or screwball comedies. Big-screen newcomers Erik White and Abdul Williams dont reinvent the wheel of fortune in Lottery Ticket but the director and screenwriter respectively deliver a well-plotted energetically paced story that unfolds over the July 4th long weekend. The holiday means our hero must survive an onslaught of gold-diggers and thugs until he can turn in his winning ticket Tuesday morning. The neighbourhood is loaded up with stock characters - in particular Kevins church-going grandmother (Loretta Devine) a gangster boss (Keith David) and a reclusive old boxer (Ice Cube) who hears everything thats going down in the hood via his basement-apartment air vent. But engaging performances by a winning cast make for a more than tolerable long weekend. Lottery Ticket delivers a worthy winner in Kevin a responsible young man who has put aside his dreams of becoming a clothing designer to support himself and his grandmother working as a shoe store sales clerk. Hes played by former teen rap star Bow Wow - hes convincing as a youth with good heart and street smarts whos not completely immune to temptation. After reluctantly accepting a 100000 ""advance"" from a dapper local crime boss Kevin lavishes gifts on his posse of friends and heads out on the town with the sexiest girl on the block - only to discover later that night she wants to make a baby to secure a life of luxury. Along for the ride is Kevins childhood friend Benny played by Brandon T. Jackson who channels a bit of the annoying but likable smart-aleck protector he played earlier this year in Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians. When Kevin narrowly escapes an attempt by Lorenzo ( The Wires Gbenga Akinnagbe) a local thug to steal the ticket Benny offers to hold it. Suspicious of almost everyone now Kevin turns to Stacie (Naturi Naughton) the girl next door whose earthy beauty warmth and intelligence put him back on course - that is until Lorenzo knocks him out and nabs the unsigned ticket. The comedy in Lottery Ticket is more ""light"" than ""screwball"" save for an outrageous Sunday sermon by a charismatic preacher (Michael Epps) who shows his congregation a slide show of the magnificent cathedral mansion and gorgeous future wife God intends him to have knowing Kevin is captive in the pews. Lottery Tickets appealing vibe is marred only by a violent showdown between Kevin and the bad guys at the Independence Day neighbourhood BBQ. Its as if the filmmakers suddenly decide to inject some reality into what is essentially a fantasy being that the movie is set in the projects and all. Its a false note but its certainly not jarring enough to turn this retro windfall comedy into a loser.

Credit Warner Brothers Pictures The comedy ""Lottery Ticket"" may be the video director Erik Whites first feature but the prevailing presence in this crowd-pleaser is Ice Cube whose evolution from hip-hop threat to screen paterfamilias is now complete. (Was he really once one of gangsta raps founding fathers in N.W.A.? I guess hes been busy masterminding the ""Friday"" ""Barbershop"" and ""Are We There Yet?"" franchises -- and being an executive producer here.)In Abdul Williamss well-oiled script the high school graduate Kevin Carson (the actor-singer-rapper Bow Wow nicely transitioning into a matinee idol) aspires to be a sneaker designer but escape from the projects doesnt look likely. His unemployed buddy Benny (Brandon T. Jackson) isnt helping.But at least theres Stacie (Naturi Naughton the best part of the ""Fame"" remake) -- the churchgoing girl his grandmother (Loretta Devine) approves of -- whos there when a fortune cookie supplies the winning numbers to a 370 million jackpot. Before long his neighbors as well as a loan shark (Keith David) a stunning temptress (Teairra Mari) and a bully (Gbenga Akinnagbe from ""The Wire"") all want a piece of him.A big vivid supporting cast -- including Faheem Najm (a k a the rapper T-Pain) and the comedians Charlie Murphy and Mike Epps -- is a strong asset as are messages about sexual responsibility and charity in the hood. Most surprising is the dissing of rappers ""What are they giving back besides shout-outs?"" says an indignant Stacie.This in a movie starring Ice Cube as a reclusive sagacious ex-boxer and the films heart. Referring to the neighbors he tells Kevin to ""let em know I still got it."" And he certainly does. ""Lottery Ticket"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual content strong language mild violence and a drug reference. Advertisement Continue reading the main story LOTTERY TICKETOpens on Friday nationwide.

(L-r) BOW WOW as Kevin Carson and LORETTA DEVINE as Grandma in Alcon EntertainmentOs comedy OLOTTERY TICKETO a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Photo David Lee Warner Bros. Pictures Review Lottery Ticket 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Lottery Ticket Comedy. Starring Bow Wow Loretta Devine Brandon T. Jackson and Ice Cube. Directed by Erik White. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If any of the central characters in ""Lottery Ticket"" had a bit of sense the movie would be over in about five minutes. Lotto and Powerball players should consider this film required viewing as what not to do when in possession of a winning ticket. But what the movies protagonists lack in intelligence and self-preservation they make up for with heart. If you can get over the anxiety that comes from watching a skinny kid stick a piece of paper worth 370 million in his wallet and walk around the projects for 72 hours its easy to have an enjoyable time. Director Erik White seems heavily influenced by ""House Party"" an underrated 1990 comedy starring rapper Christopher Reid from Kid n Play and the late Robin Harris as a son coming of age with a strict but loving single father. ""Lottery Ticket"" isnt as funny - and the music is nowhere near as infectious - but the script has the same core of positivity and strong values in a broken family. (Both films have nearly identical scenes that advocate condom use.) Bow Wow stars as Kevin a recent high school graduate who lives with his strict but loving grandmother (Loretta Devine) in an Atlanta low-income housing development. Co-writers White and Abdul Williams take their time introducing the various characters in this vibrant community where violence is always present but the core is made up of good people. Kevin seems like a promising responsible kid - his Foot Locker job is good for a few laughs - until he gains possession of a winning lottery ticket at the beginning of a three-day weekend and everyone in the housing project finds out. Instead of hiding out in a far-away Motel 6 until the lottery office opens he stays in the hood dodging drug dealers loan sharks and opportunist hotties who want to have his baby. Among the enormous cast of secondary actors Auto-Tune pioneer T-Pain makes a relaxed and memorable comic debut as a liquor store clerk and Mike Epps is funny as an opportunistic preacher. ""Lottery Ticket"" producer Ice Cube also stands out in a role thats halfway between Clubber Lang from ""Rocky III"" and the Cedric the Entertainer character from ""Barbershop."" The movie doesnt live up to the promise of the strong first half hour and seems written on the fly - a series of gags in place of a cohesive story. Some of these scenes are funny. Others fall flat. Pretty soon the only thing holding the plot together is a series of increasingly bad decisions by Kevin and his friends. Like many movies in this urban comedy genre the big finish manages to glorify violence with its actions while condemning violence with its words. But by that time enough goodwill has been built up to forgive most of the movies transgressions. ""Lottery Ticket"" is likable and that goes a long way. -- Advisory This movie contains drug use violence sexuality and profanity. The winning numbers are 42 22 4 32 5 and 21.

By David Lee AP Lottery Ticket comes up a few numbers short Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | ABOUT THE MOVIELottery Ticket  out of four Stars Bow Wow Brandon T. Jackson Ice Cube Naturi Naughton Loretta Devine Terry Crews Keith DavidDirector Erik WhiteDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for sexual content language including a drug reference some violence and brief underage drinkingRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Lottery Ticket is no prize. The comedy is broad bordering on offensive the laughs are few and the positive message feels tacked on. But star Bow Wow shows his early youthful talent has blossomed into bona fide star appeal. The ultimate message of giving back to the community is of course an important and valid one but as social commentary its delivered rather feebly. Many of the characters are stereotypes played for laughs. So any sense of conscience is undermined by the ridiculous antics and caricatures which seem to lampoon the African-American community rather than find real humor in situations. The saving grace is in a pair of performances by Bow Wow who rises above much of the silliness and Ice Cube who plays a grizzled recluse who comes to Bow Wows rescue. Ice Cube emerges as the movies only intriguing character the sole role with substance. From the rapper-turned-actors early days as an inner-city tough in Boyz n the Hood followed years later by his ruefully funny turns in the Barbershop movies he has evolved into a multi-faceted character actor with occasional deviations into family-friendly turf in such films as 2005s Are We There Yet and its sequel. TRAILER Get a look at Lottery Ticket Bow Wow plays Kevin a good guy who works at Foot Locker lives with his grandma (Loretta Devine) and dreams of becoming a shoe designer. Amid lottery jackpot fever he carelessly buys a ticket though he says he doesnt believe in playing. ""Its just designed to keep poor people poor"" he insists in the movies most insightful line. But hope is hard to resist. Of course he wins the 370 million but the winning numbers are announced just before a long holiday weekend so Kevin has to endure three days of mayhem before he can claim his prize. Meanwhile hes beset by a parade of cliched obstacles a trash-talking gossip a nasty thug a sinister crime boss a hottie siren a thieving minister. Kevin comes to suspect everyone of opportunism fearing that even his closest friends may be out for his newfound money. By the conclusion its no surprise that he learns to value friendship over finances and the true-blue gal pal over the seductive gold digger. Director Erik White draws an accomplished performance from Bow Wow and a mature dimensional portrayal by Ice Cube but the rest of the film is fractured from occasionally intrusive handheld camera moves to sudden shifts of tone from broad comedy to gritty violence. Despite its predictability the high concept has the potential for lively comic farce. But as executed more jittery and slapstick than energetic or satirical its no winner.

He hopes one day to design sneakers.As the July Fourth weekend looms lottery fever sweeps through the community. The jackpot has climbed to 370 million. His friends and neighbors are banking on the bank they are certain to win. Kevin? He tells his best friend Benny (Brandon T. Jackson) that the lottery is a scheme ""to keep poor people poor by selling them false dreams.""But when he buys a Mondo Millions ticket for Grandma (Loretta Devine) playing the numbers that came to her in a dream Kevin impulsively plunks down a dollar for himself as well playing the numbers that came in his fortune cookie.When he wins the Lotto Kevin loses nearly everything - friends family community - as everyone from the local ganglord to his pastor tries to get his fingers on the winning ticket. Kevin cant redeem it because its a holiday weekend.In the cartoonish film directed by Erik White from a screenplay by Abdul Williams what ensues is a slapstick skirmish between temptation and caution with Kevins soul as the battleground. Everybody wants a piece of him. The prospect of money makes everybody silly. Who can he trust?Not the gang lord (Keith David) who advances him a bundle - with strings attached. Not the bully Lorenzo (Gbenga Akinnagbe) who plans to beat Kevin up and steal the ticket. Not the hoochie mama (Teairra Marri) who angles to guarantee herself an annuity by becoming his baby mama.Support comes from his friends Stacie (Naturi Naughton) and Benny but also from an unexpected corner. Mr. Washington (Ice Cube) a recluse who lives on cherry cola and beef jerky reminds Kevin that community is not a place to escape but to uplift.(Cube Vision the actor/rappers company produced the movie.)Like Kevins lucky fortune cookie Lottery Ticket is a sweet treat with a substantive message.Lottery Ticket 1/2 (out of four stars)Directed by Erik White.

The makers of ""Lottery Ticket have a handle on the crawling-out-of-the-woodwork part as they populate their comedy with flamboyant figures who stereotypical as they may be at least help us roll with the movies cheerful-projects setting. But when it comes to cash-infusion kookiness your average MTV ""Cribs episode flashes more imagination.Bow Wow is all youthful agreeability as Kevin a nice guy who spends his days hanging with a motormouth named Benny (Brandon T. Jackson) and a good-girl named Stacie (Naturi Naughton ""Notorious). Kevin runs the usual gantlet of colorful neighborhood characters as he futilely tries to punch in on time at the local Foot Locker.He encounters more trouble when he balks at a demand for free footwear from a scary parolee named Lorenzo (Gbenga Akinnagbe ""The Wire). Then Kevin plays the lottery and when his numbers hit Lorenzo sees something else he wants. Pretty soon others are following suit and wouldnt you know its Fourth of July weekend which means Kevin has to find a way to hang onto his ticket and his health for three whole days until the lottery commission office reopens.There are some amusing looks at the elation -- and panic -- that come with winning big from the praise-Jesus swooning of Kevins grandma (underutilized Loretta Devine) to Bennys plan to escape their grabby neighbors using a history-class Underground Railroad map. Ice Cube is fun to watch as a grizzled shut-in with some cantankerously sage advice to give. But despite all the signposts indicating comedic excess ahead director Erik White (best known for helming music videos) never really delivers. Kevin has old-school gangsters (Keith David and Terry Crews) and a gospel preacher (Mike Epps) reach into his pockets he goes on a shopping spree and he runs around dodging Lorenzo and his buddies. Routine silliness.White and writer Abdul Williams are determined to squeeze in some social commentary. And while this too is mostly familiar stuff a couple of bits do resonate. An argument between Kevin and Benny over the need to give back to the community is competently acted but heavy-handed. More effective is the underplayed moment that caps a wacky-sexy bedroom scene between Kevin and a gold-digging hottie (Teairra Mari) whos turned off when he just says no to getting her pregnant. ""A [girls] gotta get paid she huffs gesturing to her lingerie-model body. ""And this is my lottery ticket.

"Lottery Ticket Putting some spin on a win | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLottery Ticket Putting some spin on a win""Lottery Ticket"" When winning isnt the ticket to an easy life.Brandon T. Jackson and Bow Wow star in Lottery Ticket.  (HANDOUT)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarThu. Aug. 19 2010Lottery Ticket(out of 4)Starring Bow Wow Brandon T. Jackson and Ice Cube. Directed by Erik White. 99 minutes. At major theatres. PGAs Biggie Smalls famously prophesized mo money does indeed beget mo problems for the hero of Lottery Ticket a formulaic comedy thats enlivened by the high spirits of its supporting players. Serving as straight man is Bow Wow the former kid rapper whos grown too old for the ""Lil"" that used to begin his stage name. Last seen in a particularly thankless guest part on HBOs Entourage he stars as Kevin a sneaker-obsessed young man who doesnt attract much attention from his neighbours in a housing project until he ends up with a lottery ticket worth 370 million.Article Continued BelowUnable to claim the million prize until after Fourth of July weekend is through Kevin is beset by numerous folks whod like to get on his good side. Among the stock types competing for his favour are foxy gold digger Nikki Swayze (Teairra Mari) and smooth-talking local gangster Sweet Tee (Keith David). His friends Benny (Tropic Thunders Brandon T. Jackson) and Stacie (Naturi Naughton) try to protect his best interests but hes vulnerable to temptation. Hes also vulnerable to a serious beating by Lorenzo (The Wires Gbenga Akinnagbe) a thuggish ex-con who took a strong dislike to Kevin even before the whole business with the lottery began.All this serves as a prelude to a positive social message about sharing good fortune rather than blowing it on bling. But before Lottery Ticket turns preachy in its final third -- a prerequisite for any Hollywood movie targeted at African-American audiences in the age of Tyler Perry -- there are plenty of good times to be had thanks to the efforts of some reliably funny actors. Charlie Murphy the former Chappelles Show regular (and brother of Eddie) supplies some memorable moments as the loose-lipped local who lets everyone know about Kevins ticket. Also seen this summer amid the thick-necked cast of The Expendables Terry Crews lets fly as a Sweet Tee lackey assigned to be Kevins bodyguard. And Mike Epps - wearing what appears to be a suit he borrowed from Katt Williams--has a terrific cameo as a prosperity-minded pastor looking for Kevins help to upgrade his lifestyle.Most surprising is executive producer Ice Cubes low-key turn as a grizzled ex-boxer who comes to Kevins aid.A former music-video director making his feature debut Erik White may not display a distinctive style but he knows when to let his actors do their thing. Plus he rarely lets the films momentum flag for long.At its best Lottery Ticket has the same easy-going charm as the Friday movies that paired Ice Cube with Epps back in the early oughts. At its not-so-best (which mostly occupies the last half hour) the movie is still a passably engaging cautionary tale about the things that money can bring and the other things that it cant.

Share Tweet The 1995 hit Friday signaled a profound change in Ice Cubes life career and image as the scowling provocateur of NWA and Amerikkkas Most Wanted became an unlikely straight man who anchored slice-of-life comedies like the Friday sequels and Barbershop movies with his agreeably gruff persona. The winning new comedy-drama Lottery Ticket from Cubes production company Cube Vision echoes Friday and Barbershop in its leisurely pacing and colorful tale of a neighborhood that develops money fever when one of its own gains possession of a winning lottery ticket worth 370 million. Only this time charming young upstart Bow Wow inhabits the Ice Cube role of the straight man reacting to a world of larger-than-life characters and free-floating mayhem and Cube takes a character role as a mysterious hermit. Bow Wow leads a sprawling oversized cast of ringers as a sweet young man who dreams of escaping his desperately poor neighborhood by starting his own shoe company. His life changes for the better when he buys the ticket but with mo money comes mo problems. Soon hes the subject of attention both wanted (a hood vixen suddenly gets dollar signs in her eyes when she looks at him) and unwanted (his rising fortune puts him on the radar of the neighborhoods crime kingpin and bully). Like Barbershop The Lottery Ticket is about a community as much as it is about a lucky young man who gets in over his head. Late in the film a heavy dramatic scene between Bow Wow and best friend Brandon T. Jackson should stop the film dead and feel jarring tonally but the filmmakers have done such a fine job of establishing an undercurrent of lower-class despair and desperation that the scene proves unexpectedly poignant even amid a lot of lowbrow wackiness and flashy turns from scene-stealers like Terry Crews as Bow Wows driver/bodyguard the ubiquitous Loretta Devine as his God-fearing mother Charlie Murphy as the neighborhood gossip and even a surprisingly hilarious T-Pain as the man who sells Bow Wow his golden ticket. Lottery Ticket gets far on the strength of its stars charisma and a likeable tone that falters only during Bow Wows sordid encounter with an opportunistic would-be conquest. Even in a hangout movie this affable alas gold-diggers still get no love.

Cast Bow Wow Brandon T. Jackson Naturi Naughton. Rating PG-13 for sexual content language including a drug reference some violence and brief underage drinking. 10 movies about easy money Watching ""Lottery Ticket"" is a similar experience. Director Erik Whites film about a sensible young man (Bow Wow) growing up in the projects who wins the lottery but cannot for purposes of the plot cash it in right away looks at first like it might be a winner but then things go bust. The story gives way to inconsistency and finally incredulity by the time its over playing up stereotypes for broad comic relief even as it tries to make larger points about society. There are a couple of good performances and a few funny bits but mostly the film just bounces back and forth until coming to a flat trite close. Kevin Carson (Bow Wow) is a recent high-school graduate holding down a job at Foot Locker - a job being something his best friend Benny (Brandon T. Jackson) hasnt gotten around to finding. Kevin lives with his grandmother (Loretta Davis) in an Atlanta housing project. Kevins walk to work through the neighborhood accompanied by Benny and Kevins friend - not as he repeatedly insists to his grandmother his girlfriend Stacie (Naturi Naughton) - introduces us to some of the characters in his midst. Most are friends and acquaintances just hanging out. More worrisome is Lorenzo (Gbenga Akinnagbe) back on the streets after a stint in prison. He will have a few pairs of the new Air Jordans he announces to Kevin who is decked out in his Foot Locker uniform. Before you know it Kevins out of a job Lorenzos mad and on his trail and life is generally looking pretty grim. On the way home while buying a lottery ticket for his grandma (from Faheem Najm better known as T-Pain and funny in a genuinely comfortable way) Kevin figuring why not buys one for himself as well. And despite his preaching against the lottery he wakes up the next day to learn that hes the winner of the 370 million jackpot. One problem The lottery office is closed for the next three days thanks to the July Fourth holiday so he cant immediately cash in the ticket. And in his neighborhood that can be a dangerous thing. He swears his grandmother to secrecy but both blab; soon Kevin is navigating a sea of flunkies hangers-on loan sharks and worse (which is to say Lorenzo). Among the more amusing of the bunch despite a cliched character is the always-funny Mike Epps as money-hungry preacher the Rev. Taylor. Trickier and somewhat out of place in a comedy like this is the role of Nikki played by Teairra Mari a predatory would-be baby mama whom the normally level-headed Kevin cant see through even though everyone else - Stacie the audience - can from a mile away. Ice Cube also a producer of the film shows up as Mr. Washington a recluse with an interesting past and a showdown brews among Sweet Tee (Keith David) the loan shark Lorenzo and Kevin. But the payoff is weak and with nowhere else to turn White goes from sentimental to full-on sappy at the end. Bow Wow gives it a nice effort and Jackson has a nice turn while teaching Kevin something about loyalty. But for all that ""Lottery Ticket"" never really cashes in.

Bow Wow) in Lottery Ticket (David Lee) B- Lottery Ticket Starring Bow Wow Ice Cube; Director Erik White; Author Abdul Williams; Release Date Wide 08/20/2010 Posted August 20 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Shad Gregory Moss hasnt gone by the name Lil Bow Wow for some time now. But if you squint hard enough and try to ignore the barrage of broad African-American stereotypes in his latest film Lottery Ticket its easy to see that the former pint-size Snoop Dog protege has grown into a likable leading man. In this frenetic family-friendly riff on the Friday formula Bow Wow plays Kevin an honest hard-working high school grad who lives in an Atlanta housing project and punches the clock selling Air Jordans at the local Foot Locker. That is until he realizes hes holding the winning ticket in a 370 million lottery. After his loose-lipped Bible-thumping grandma (Waiting to Exhales Loretta Devine) spills the beans about his imminent payday a flood of characters (or to be more accurate caricatures) cozy up to him to get their cut. Gangsters gospel preachers gold diggers -- Kevin sees through their greed and ulterior motives. But not before going on a wild spending spree that would make Pretty Woman proud. The problem is music video director Erik Whites blue-collar fantasy wants to have it both ways For every well-intentioned speech Kevin gives about the lottery being a rigged game designed to keep poor folks down theres a montage of him giddily blowing wads of cash on sneakers and sports cars. If Lottery Ticket had as much conviction as laughs it could have hit the jackpot.

"Lottery Ticket is a winner thanks to its cast - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3 starsLottery Ticket is a winner thanks to its castAugust 19 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic3 stars Its hard out there for a kid from the projects who scores a 370 million lottery payoff but must wait for the claim office to reopen (infernal federal holiday). Suddenly he has ""a premature crack baby felon"" straight out of prison and willing -- eager in fact -- to kill for it. Not to mention the notorious local Jezebel interested in the young mans company. This is the premise of ""Lottery Ticket"" an ensemble comedy from a pair of first-time feature filmmaking collaborators screenwriter Abdul Williams and director Erik White. You know what? This movies good. Its fast deftly paced and funny and only some misjudged violence in the last lap keeps it from being better than good. One foot in fantasyland the other in the real world the picture isnt out for anything except laughs plus a little astute sociology. Virtually everyone on screen knows where to find those laughs how to deliver them and how hard to push them -- i.e. not hard enough to tire us out before the leading character learns of his scary stroke of luck. The film was shot in Atlanta but the locale is Any Project USA. Director White (who has done scads of videos) navigates fluidly the ins and outs and denizens of this sprawling development. Protagonist Kevin played by Bow Wow lives with his grandmother ( Loretta Devine). His best friend Benny ( Brandon T. Jackson) doesnt understand why Kevin takes the time to help out the mysterious recluse ( Ice Cube who also executive-produced) who lives in the basement. ""Dude has slave dust on him"" he mutters. In the opening scenes lottery fever has hit the entire neighborhood and Kevin a Foot Locker employee who dreams of attending design school expresses disdain for any racket ""designed to keep poor people poor."" Upon learning he has won millions he becomes a conflicted soul up for grabs. He must survive the next three days to cash in; as a bridge ""loan"" he takes a satchel of bills from the local mobster ( Keith David) and goes on a tear with his cronies. On the fly we hear throwaway lines such as Bennys pickup attempt ""I need a girl I can take to church and the strip clubs."" Its not polite its not high-minded and it sticks to various formulas but ""Lottery Ticket"" plays into the strengths of its prodigiously talented cast. And then it sort of dies near the end. The increasing focus on sociopath Lorenzo (Gbenga Akinnagbe) is sour and frightening in a noncomic way and I really do wish the filmmakers could rethink the grimly prolonged shot of Akinnagbe squeezing Davids nethers. Also I would rethink the sound effect cue in this bit; some are just plain wrong. I was perfectly happy keeping time with everybody else in ""Lottery Ticket"" notably the two leads (whose friendship is tested by the sudden arrival of millions) and Kevins childhood pal played by Naturi Naughton as sincere and easygoing as Mike Epps is hilarious in his cameo as a self-interested Baptist minister with one eye on his flock and the other on a future financed by the reluctant newly wealthy ""Moses of the projects."" Epps few minutes of screen time score. And then the movie dashes onward. MPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content language including a drug reference some violence and brief underage drinking) Cast Bow Wow (Kevin); Brandon T. Jackson (Benny); Naturi Naughton (Stacie); Keith David (Sweet Tee); Gbenga Akinnagbe (Lorenzo); Terry Crews (Jimmy); Loretta Devine (Grandma); Ice Cube (Mr. Washington); Mike Epps (the Rev. Taylor) Credits Directed by Erik White; written by Abdul Williams; produced by Mark Burg Oren Koules Andrew A. Kosove Broderick Johnson and Matt Alvarez. A Warner Bros. Pictures release.

The holder of a 370 million lottery ticket that he cant cash in until after the July 4 holiday Kevin accepts a 100000 loan from a local gangster and proceeds to spend it all in one night. He and his buddies ditch their Atlanta project and hit electronics stores jewelry shops and fancy restaurants. They buy out the Foot Locker from which Kevin was recently dismissed. And Kevin gets a striptease from the hottest girl he knows.Because Kevin is played by the rapper Bow Wow (ne Lil Bow Wow) its tempting to view this section of the film as aspirational autobiography. This is basically how Bow Wow lives most of the time right? The kids in the audience at my screening cheered wildly for every scene of Kevins cash frenzy. It would be pretty sweet to have that much moneyCredit Lottery Ticket for honesty I guess in never making an argument against being fabulously wealthy. Though Kevin--who early in the movie speaks truth to power about the lottery as a tax on poor people and gets called ""Urkel"" and ""Martin Luther King"" for his troubles--will eventually learn to be more careful with his windfall Lottery Ticket isnt exactly a cautionary tale. At no point does anyone suggest that Kevin give the 370 million back or hand it over to orphans or anything. The theme of this formulaic but vibrant ensemble comedy could best be described as a paraphrase of Biggies well-worn credo Mo money mo problems--but mo money yeah definitely.Lottery Ticket works best when it uses the housing project to orchestrate zany collisions of broad comic types all played by familiar faces the neighborhood gossip (Charlie Murphy) the hysterical granny (Loretta Devine) the avaricious preacher (Mike Epps) the dapper gangster (Keith David). The loose-limbed and funny Brandon T. Jackson best known as Booty Sweat pitchman Alpa Chino in Tropic Thunder plays Kevins motor-mouthed best friend Benny. The Wires Gbenga Akinnagbe plays the growling preening bad guy Lorenzo Mack. A wonderfully awkward and unnatural T-Pain appears as a bodega owner.And Ice Cube a producer on the movie plays . . . well theres no easy way to say this to readers of a certain age. Ice Cube plays an old head a retired ex-boxer named Thump who in Bennys memorable description ""still got slave dust on him."" Sure Cubes hair has been whitened by a makeup artist and hes putting on that old-man voice but still watching him putter around telling stories of bygone days is a sorry reminder of just how very very long its been since Friday the movie that perfected the template from which Lottery Ticket was drawn.Lottery Ticket of course is a lot more innocent than that classic. Bow Wow never quite manages to tap that fine fine ass; in fact hes set straight by its owner Nikki (Teairra Mari) who points to her body and notes bitterly ""This is my lottery ticket."" Guns are waved but never fired. This housing project is free of drugs; so rare is crime apparently that Lorenzo Macks brief stint in prison makes him the most terrifying nemesis imaginable. In the world of this movie violence has no collateral damage and the ills of poverty can be solved through a generous donation from a lottery winner and the hiring of an elderly boxer as a security guard.Its comforting really to see the movies soft-pedaling of actual ghetto problems; realism isnt Lottery Tickets game. After all in the real world peer pressure and multiple beatings would have forced Kevin to shave that terrible little goatee Bow Wow insists on sporting. And in the real world director Erik White who has a terrific sense of composition and shoots crisp energetic chase scenes will use Lottery Ticket as a calling card for plenty of bigger jobs on tougher grittier more violent movies. They might be as stupid as this one but they probably wont be as much fun.

Playing like a high-concept twist on ""Friday"" but never managing that films combination of sweet local flavor and comically played dark elements ""Lottery Ticket"" is a frantic at times too-broad comedy about the travails of a recent lotto winner. Directed with unexpected verve and style by Erik White the script is never nearly as clever as the premise ought to allow and the madcap fun is far too frequently derailed by tonal inconsistencies. There are bright moments to be found however and the Warner Bros. item should score midlevel winnings on its Aug. 20 release. Former child rapper Bow Wow tackles his first adult leading part as Kevin a Foot Locker salesman living with his grandmother (Loretta Devine) in an Atlanta housing project. An admirably economical opening scene in which Kevin is continually interrupted on his way to work introduces the colorful neighborhood including best friend Benny (Brandon T. Jackson) super-hot girl-next-door Stacie (Naturi Naughton) incrementally hotter mean girl Nikki (Teairra Mari) and a whole Greek chorus worth of local layabouts. After a run-in with a frighteningly muscled ex-con (Gbenga Akinnagbe) leaves Kevin jobless and with a price on his head he buys a ticket for the imminent 370 million lottery drawing as a consolation. Owing to the magic of fortune cookies Kevins numbers come up -- but this being the Fourth of July weekend he must spend three days navigating his way through sycophantic well-wishers and more malicious forces before he can claim his money. The premise here is promising and never better explored than in the pics earliest scenes when Kevins woozy euphoria seesaws with crazed panic. But some easily avoided bad decisions make Kevins ordeal almost too conveniently difficult (especially an ill-advised deal with a creepy loan shark followed by one of the more joyless shopping-spree montages in recent memory) and clumsy stabs at social commentary slow things down when they should be spiraling out of control. Young director White shoots the film with some almost neorealist splashes of grit and the scenes set around the project grounds feel welcomely vivid and lived-in. He doesnt quite manage to sustain this tone unfortunately and the pic vacillates between gentle comedy and strangely brutal violence later on with no solid center to hold things together. Bow Wow manages his part well enough though his is a mostly reactive role and he resorts to scowly emoting whenever required to show some agency of his own. But the real surprise is exec producer Ice Cube who plays against type as an elderly agoraphobic former boxer. Gray-bearded and painfully hunched-over Cube taps into a rarely seen reservoir of soul for such a minor part. Other supporting players are hit-and-miss. Mike Epps somehow manages to barely graze the easiest of targets as an unscrupulous gospel preacher and Terry Crews is wasted as a cookie-cutter tough guy. But Charlie Murphy is quietly hilarious as the neighborhood gossip and most unexpectedly first-time actor Faheem Najm (better known as ubiquitous Auto-Tune purveyor T-Pain) completely steals his three scenes as a liquor store clerk. Technical contributions are mostly pro and though some may find the editing a bit rushed and jagged it keeps things snappy and visually interesting.

The twist in this Warner Bros. release is that the story is set in an African-American community -- OK its set in the projects -- which triggers an unfortunate onslaught of caricatures one had hoped had gone out of fashion a long time ago. The good news for Tyler Perry is that no one will dare call him unsubtle after ""Lottery Ticket.""Let loose in the dog days of August the comedys boxoffice profile should rise sharply with urban audiences then fall even more steeply.Rapper-actor Bow Wow plays Kevin a well-meaning 18-year-old from the projects -- presumably in Georgia because thats where the movie was made -- who through force of contrived circumstances wins a ""Mondo Millions Lottery."" This incredulously happens just before a 4th of July weekend so the state lottery offices are closed. Consequently Kevin has to survive four days in the neighborhood jungle before he can claim his reward.Cue a shockingly banal parade of cartoon personalities determined to get a piece of Kevins winnings. In no particular order he must cope with a gossipy heedless grandmother (Loretta Devine who deserves a better fate); a ghetto godfather (Keith David); a charlatan preacher (Mike Epps); a neighborhood tramp (Teairra Mari); and a thug parolee (Gbenga Akinnagbe) who wont take no or yes as an answer.Strangely before he wins this lottery our Kevin spends the movies first quarter of an hour walking through his hood encountering all and sundry while trying to get to his job at a Foot Locker store. His exhaustion over having to deal with these difficult ""personalities"" is palpable. Then upon winning a fortune its as if he never knew their true nature. The thought of millions apparently has rendered him guileless.First he vows along with his grandmother to tell no one about his sudden good fortune. But within minutes thanks to vow-breaking on both their parts everyone knows. Then Kevin becomes a much different person.Why would a seemingly street-smart kid suddenly cozy up to all the worst sorts in his neighborhood but question his best pal (Brandon T. Jackson) and disrespect his sweetheart (Naturi Naughton)? Meanwhile a thug strolls through this community supposedly on parole yet flashing guns and beating brains out with impunity. That might not be unrealistic but the character doesnt fit comfortably in an essentially comic environment.Video director Erik Whites debut film is an awkward one as he is unable to blend broad comedy with the uncomfortable ghetto realities in a story he dreamed up with screenwriter Abdul Williams. So he alternates between implausible slapstick and gooey melodrama. Ice Cube one of the executive producers gives himself the role of a recluse who sets Kevin straight. One can only wish such sagacity had been brought to bear on the production itself. No one on the creative side has his eyes on the characters so they flounder in a sea of misguided energy.Opens Friday Aug. 20 (Warner Bros.)production Alcon Entertainment presents a Burg-Koules/CubeVision productionCast Bow Wow Brandon T.
