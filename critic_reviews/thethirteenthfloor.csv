In movies like Strange Days and The Lawnmower Man you sat back you...1999-06-11Dennis Haysbert D The Thirteenth Floor Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Craig Bierko Vincent DOnofrio Gretchen Mol Dennis Haysbert; Director Josef Rusnak; MPAA Rating R Posted June 11 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT Remember when virtual reality meant good eye-twirling fun? In movies like Strange Days and The Lawnmower Man you sat back you strapped on your futuristic psychedelic headset and voila -- you were transported to tantalizing landscapes of fantasy and pleasure as if entering the movie of your dreams. It all seems rather quaint now. As an entertainment concept virtual reality has yet to match those fanciful joyride visions but as a cinematic metaphor it has already been turned inside out. In the new technological head-trip thrillers like The Matrix eXistenZ and The Thirteenth Floor virtual reality isnt the world you escape to; its the world youre already living in. You still strap on that headset (or plug into that nasty-looking bioport) only now its to brainwash yourself out of your illusions. Leave it to the cyberobsessive late 90s to take all the fun out of getting away. In The Thirteenth Floor the hero (Craig Bierko) a fearless mind-leap jockey enters the world of 1937 Los Angeles a silvery panorama of classic cars and smoky posh nightclubs. As he wanders through this mirage he gawks at the extraordinary tactile reality of it all. Those of us actually watching the film may find it hard to identify since what we see appears to be little more than a cliche period movie set. Still The Thirteenth Floor is out to wow you with its multilevel gamesmanship. The films vintage L.A. isnt real and neither it turns out is the computer bunker where this virtual metropolis was cooked up. So what is real? Only the head-scratching boredom of the audience as the film collapses from one meaningless false-bottom environment to the next. The surest sign that The Matrix was on to something -- at least before it turned into an anti-gravity kung fu blowout -- is that its vision of society blinded by a corporation-controlled image culture could be so narrowly misinterpreted even by its fans as a sci-fi projection of the Internet. Like The Truman Show the movie was about the real virtual reality the spiritual mall weve all tacitly agreed to live in. The Thirteenth Floor on the other hand is a series of Chinese boxes enclosing a void. The characters keep popping up in dual-reality roles and the different wardrobes just make them seem like ciphers in search of a screen test. Armin Mueller-Stahl as the brilliant innovator of all this techno-facade nonsense wrings such familiar weary melancholy out of his continental presence that hes starting to look like a highly evolved hologram. Hes the perfect actor for a movie like The Thirteenth Floor -- a virtual one-man Old Europe.

"The Thirteenth Floor Traveling in Cyberspace Can Get a Guy Cyberkilled May 28 1999 FILM REVIEW The Thirteenth Floor Traveling in Cyberspace Can Get a Guy Cyberkilled Related Articles The New York Times on the Web Current Film Video Selected Scenes and Trailer From the Film Forum Join a Discussion on Current Film By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER ome doors are best left unopened and one of them leads to movies with the kind of denouement that resembles one of those boxes of salt with a picture of a woman holding a box of salt with a picture of a woman holding a box of salt with a picture of ... The possibilities extend ad infinitum and in the case of ""The 13th Floor"" ad nauseam. Repackaged as cyberthriller the old time-travel adventure returns in this stylish but overplotted and ultimately illogical combination of science fiction mystery and romance. The science fiction seems up to date with its computer images and parallel worlds including 1937 Los Angeles. The solution to the mystery turns out to be a yawner that doesnt bear much scrutiny. And the romance with ever-so-faint echoes of Hitchcocks ""Vertigo"" needs a better chemistry set. But ""The 13th Floor"" directed by Josef Rusnak from a screenplay he wrote with Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez can be appreciated for its re-creation of a Los Angeles of empty lots on Wilshire Boulevard a skyline of oil wells and visions of white-tied swells riding in Packard town cars or dancing the night away to ""Caravan"" in Art Deco supper clubs while the less fortunate sweat out the Depression. The plot based on the novel ""Simulacron 3"" by Daniel Galouye positions its main characters in parallel worlds where they lead different lives. In the world of the 1990s the principals are employees of the visionary magnate Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) whose projects include an experimental computer-chip simulation of old Los Angeles. ADVERTISEMENT After a journey to this virtually real world where he leaves an important letter with Ashton (Vincent DOnofrio) an untrustworthy bartender in the elegant supper club Hannon frequents for its young female companionship he returns makes a hurried telephone call from a seedy bar and is promptly and brutally knifed to death. Next morning Hannons favorite executive and heir apparent Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko) wakes to find a blood-drenched shirt in his apartment and to find himself the prime suspect in events on a night he cannot remember. To complicate matters Larry McBain (Dennis Haysbert) a police detective promptly singles out Douglas as the probable killer and an alluring young woman (Gretchen Mol) turns up and announces herself to be Jane Fuller Hannons previously unknown daughter. With the help of clumsy dialogue Douglas and Jane are soon as Yogi Berra might observe experiencing a lot of deja vu all over again. These being the complications there is but one thing for Douglas to do travel to 1937 Los Angeles with the help of his colleague Whitney ( DOnofrio again) and in the persona of a bank teller named John Ferguson try to sort things out. With strong performances by DOnofrio and Mueller-Stahl and with the help of the costumes of Joseph Porro and the production design of Kirk Petruccelli ""The 13th Floor"" begins promisingly with the murder that straddles two worlds. But it strikes no sparks with its romance and as the mystery unravels so does the film. By its end a return to genuine reality is welcome. PRODUCTION NOTES ""The 13th Floor"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains a bloody murder shootings and other violence as well as coarse language and suggestions of sexual activity.

The unforgiving wages of time and the dangers of simulation turn out to be ironic benchmarks for ""The Thirteenth Floor"" since time -- and movie trends -- have passed it by while its attempts at conveying a simulated cyber-reality are an extremely mixed bag. The makers of the pic quite loosely based on Daniel Galouyes 1960s sci-fi novel ""Simulacron 3"" are clearly entranced with the notion of a supercomputer designed to provide the user with simulated time travel but never figured out how to build a dramatically intriguing story around the concept. It also comes too late far surpassed by similar and more visually stunning devices in ""The Matrix"" and even by the mind-bending realities of ""eXistenZ"" and will be squashed in general release by the ""Star Wars"" express with the only hope being some overseas coin and promising post-theatrical life. Pic from Roland and Ute Emmerichs Centropolis production squad (with Emmerichs usual writer-producer partner Dean Devlin nowhere in sight) is another variation on the general sci-fi genre in which Emmerich has immersed himself and specifically on some of the time-travel ideas from ""Stargate."" But scripters Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez and Josef Rusnak (who also helmed) become entangled in so many knotty plot problems that not even the greatest minds at Intergraph Computer Systems home of the movies supercomputer would be able to solve them. The bit of Cartesian wisdom that everyone knows ""I think therefore I am"" is pics opening graphic signaling some lightweight intellectual pretensions. Any expectations of a sci-fi futurist setting are upended by the prologue set in a sepia-toned 1937 Los Angeles where a dapper gentleman named Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) gives an important letter about ""the awful truth"" to hotel barkeep Ashton (Vincent DOnofrio) with instructions that it is only for the eyes of Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko). Fuller zaps himself back into the present but hes made the last trip hes going to make in the machine hes invented since hes murdered soon after phoning Hall. On the case LAPD Det. McBain (Dennis Haysbert) is increasingly suspicious of Hall who stands to inherit the company fortune. Hall in turn is intrigued by Jane Fuller (Gretchen Mol) who arrives from her home in Paris claiming to be Fullers daughter. With the help of long-haired assistant Whitney (also DOnofrio) Hall turns from computer mogul into cyber-sleuth as he zaps back into Fullers simulated 1937 reality to uncover the truth behind the murder. It is here that Halls -- and the audiences -- eyes are opened to the pics highlight an astonishing re-creation of a bygone City of the Angels. Rusnak and the staff of Centropolis Effects have hatched a remarkable simulation in its own right stuffed with such period detail as a view of southbound La Cienega Boulevard from Sunset Boulevard cutting through undeveloped land forested with nothing but oil derricks. Halls identity in the past is changed to that of a lowly bank clerk named John Ferguson but his quest brings him to Stahl as Pasadena bookseller Grieirson and DOnofrio as the threatening barkeep. While Grieirson is plagued by blackouts the barkeep (having read the secret letter) has uncovered the truth that he exists within a simulated reality. This inflames the barkeep leading to some distracting violent fight scenes. Meanwhile back in the present Halls sense of deja vu with Jane becomes overwhelming until the baroque plot reveals another layer of reality -- that this seeming present is itself a simulation hatched by someone somewhere else in time. It is here that pic is decidedly unimaginative in its cinematic storytelling and its haplessly written exposition despite a memorable moment when Hall stands in the Mojave Desert looking at the edges of the cyber-simulation. What appears to be a tragic end for Hall who is in a sense cyber-possessed by Janes actual very jealous husband turns happy in an epilogue set in L.A. circa 2024. Alas the bright gloss at the end (in a poorly realized visualization of a futuristic city in which buildings seemingly pop up out of the ocean) feels like a cheat and the last gasp of a thoroughly winded plot. Narrative miscues begin at the start with too much of Fullers cyber-fantasy past being revealed and a resultant lack of shock and surprise as Hall discovers the truth. What might have been an intriguing metaphor for filmmaking itself is eroded by dumbed-down dialogue of the tritest sort and a fatal lack of humor. The Devlin-Emmerich tradition of casting comic actors in lead roles in their sci-fi epics is carried on here with dour results. Bierko is completely incapable of holding his own as a lead let alone as a character who transforms no less than twice. Innocent-looking but bland he is continually upstaged by his heftier comrades especially the classily subdued Mueller-Stahl and the versatile DOnofrio. Bierkos blandness though is electric compared to the vacuous Mol who has the ideal 30s look but nothing going on inside. Much of the cutting (care of editor Henry Richardson) is crucially sharp yet dulled by the repeated and unconvincing wormhole f/x (far better done two summers ago in ""Contact"") as characters zap themselves into simulations. Production details are textured and ironic (Halls present-day offices are in fact a Frank Lloyd Wright interior) but much greater attention is given to the 30s-era effects than to the cyber-magic. The work of a predominantly German creative team including d.p.-turned-producer Michael Ballhaus pics look is a contrast of glassy sheen and sepia tones care of Wedigo von Schultzendorffs camera.

Starring Armin Mueller- Stahl Craig Bierko and Vincent DOnofrio. Directed by Josef Rusnak. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There is a very good movie stuck somewhere on ""The Thirteenth Floor"" trying to get out. Too bad this isnt it. Somewhere in this murder mystery disguised as science fiction is a terrific story. A computer programmer who has helped create a virtual-reality simulation of Los Angeles in the 1930s travels back in time to find the killer who may be himself. ""The Thirteenth Floor"" which stars Armin Mueller-Stahl (""Shine"") and Craig Bierko needs livelier performances and most of all a sense of humor but it nonetheless rewards the patience of those willing to stick with it. ""The Thirteenth Floor"" finally builds up a head of steam as the layers of the story accumulate and percolate. It bears a family resemblance to the Wachowski brothers ""The Matrix"" and David Cronenbergs ""eXistenZ"" the other current films that play off the substitution of virtual reality for the real world. ""The Thirteenth Floor"" is not the special-effects tour de force that ""The Matrix"" is but its no slouch either. The re- creation of Los Angeles in 1937 and much much later provide some of the films best moments. The year the Hindenburg crashed was the era when Los Angeles had streetcars there were oil derricks on the outskirts of town and the first highrises were going up along Wilshire Boulevard. THE GOOD OLD DAYS The first look we get of life in Los Angeles in the 30s makes it naughty but very elegant in contrast to the coarse vulgar and overbearing tone of the present. It comes as no surprise when we learn that one of the characters is traveling back in time specifically for sex. Theres a reason they called them the good old days. Theres also a reason hotels do not have a 13th floor -- it is considered unlucky. No one apparently told computer wizards Hannon Fuller and Douglas Hall visionaries who have developed their amazing silicon-chip simulation of another world on the top-secret 13th floor. Fuller (Mueller-Stahl) had begun to think of the simulation ""as his own personal playground"" which will strike home with anyone who has become addicted to the Internet. He is found stabbed to death however and Hall (Bierko) wakes up to discover his own bloody shirt and no recollection of how it got that way. He goes into the simulation which is done by slipping under a bed of green lasers to do some sleuthing. There is a lot Hall did not know about Fuller a man he had worked with intimately for years. Fullers previously unknown daughter Jane (Gretchen Mol) shows up from Paris claiming that her father planned to shut down the company. He also did not know that Fuller was sneaking into the alternate universe in order to find girls -- ""these are the units he was interacting with"" he is told. While the movie takes Descartes motto ""I think therefore I am"" as its philosophical underpinning there is a strong dose of puritanism at work too. Characters who just want to have some fun and plug into an alternate reality are severely punished. Most of the characters have counterparts in the past. They are ""units"" of virtual reality program links to the other world for the present-day characters. Each actor plays at least two roles. Vincent DOnofrio is blond in both worlds He is a long-haired unshaven geek in the present a neatly groomed bartender in the past who begins to suspect that things are not what they seem. ""I watched you and Fuller do the old switcheroo"" he tells Hall. ALTERNATE REALITIES There may not be just two realities but many of them. There are questions that leave the viewer always slightly off- balance such as ""Where did this mild- mannered computer programmer learn to fight dirty?"" It turns out too that there are limits to the simulation. It has an ""edge"" and people go to it. ""He tried to kill me"" one character says. ""He found out his world wasnt real."" People who do not live in the real world after all have nothing to lose. Not only do characters have different identities in the two realities but they sometimes have different identities in the present. Something goes haywire and the simulated characters start showing up in the present. ""Im just like you just a bunch of electricity."" Peoples identities start changing. ""When did you download into him?"" This is fascinating stuff and would be more so if the actors brought more energy to it. Bierko has not had good luck with his choice of films (Geena Davis ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" Larry Davids ""Sour Grapes"" and Terry Gilliams ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") all of which have the phrase ""ill-fated"" attached to them. Bierko might as well be a simulacrum of Vince Vaughn (""Psycho"") whom he resembles and who with his streak of craziness might have been very good in this role. The film was produced by Roland Emmerich but lacks the wit that he and Dean Devlin brought to ""Independence Day."" This film could have used some of that spark or at least something like it.

"The Thirteenth Floor (PG-13) Related Item ""The Thirteenth Floor"" showtimes Thirteenth Floor Breaks Down By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 28 1999 Craig Bierko seeks answers from a mysterious woman (Gretchen Mol). (Columbia TriStar) Director Josef Rusnak Cast Craig Bierko; Gretchen Mol; Armin Mueller-Stahl; Vincent DOnofrio; Dennis Haysbert Running Time 1 hour 41 minutes Contains minor doses of profanity sexual situations and violence When a movie quotes Descartes ""I think therefore I am"" right at the beginning you should probably consider yourself warned. ""The Thirteenth Floor"" based on Daniel F. Galouyes science fiction novel ""Simulacron 3"" uses the French philosophers most famous utterance to launch an initially compelling mystery about parallel universes. Perhaps writer/filmmaker Josef Rusnak should have altered the quotation to ""I download therefore I am"" since characters spend so much time transferring their consciousnesses to look-alike counterparts in virtual-reality worlds. One such artificial world - a virtual replica of Los Angeles in 1937 - has been created by Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) a visionary computer designer who wanted to revisit the setting of his youth. But Fuller who has been entering or ""jacking into"" the system an awful lot lately has learned he is in great danger. Working desperately against the clock and a mysterious enemy he leaves an important letter in Virtual L.A. with a strange bartender called Ashton (Vincent DOnofrio). He instructs Ashton to deliver it to a man named Douglas Hall. It turns out Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko) is Fullers right-hand man a computer researcher with good looks and fashionable stubble who helped create this world in a laboratory on the 13th floor of an office apartment building. When Fuller is found dead Hall is horrified to learn that circumstantial evidence points to him as the prime suspect. His only clue to the mystery is an 11th-hour phone message from the late Fuller that informs him about the letter but is interrupted before identifying the bartender. I hate it when that happens. With the help of Jason Whitney (also DOnofrio) his colleague who happens to be a dead ringer for Ashton Hall jacks into the virtual world to get to the bottom of the mystery. Entering a look-alike virtual being called John Ferguson (also Bierko) he starts his investigation. Did he kill Fuller without realizing it? Who has the letter? Will he solve the puzzle before Los Angeles detective McBain (Dennis Haysbert) busts him for murder? And what is it with the beautiful Jane Fuller (Gretchen Mol) who appears out of nowhere claiming to be Fullers daughter and demanding legal possession of his virtual world? ""The Thirteenth Floor"" is an enterprising project full of provocative ideas and wonderful sets saturated in period sepia tones. And for a great while the story does keep you guessing and wondering. But things become almost too strange and convoluted to handle. The storys dramatic effectiveness starts to seriously malfunction. The fascinating and the mysterious become the silly and occasionally comical. The movie gets so caught up in its own tortured stratagem youll feel as if youre stuck in some futuristic elevator between floors wondering when filmmaker Rusnak - or perhaps a virtual maintenance man - will come bail you out. Never quite happens.

In movies like Strange Days and The Lawnmower Man you sat back you...1999-06-11Dennis Haysbert D The Thirteenth Floor Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Craig Bierko Vincent DOnofrio Gretchen Mol Dennis Haysbert; Director Josef Rusnak; MPAA Rating R Posted June 11 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT Remember when virtual reality meant good eye-twirling fun? In movies like Strange Days and The Lawnmower Man you sat back you strapped on your futuristic psychedelic headset and voila -- you were transported to tantalizing landscapes of fantasy and pleasure as if entering the movie of your dreams. It all seems rather quaint now. As an entertainment concept virtual reality has yet to match those fanciful joyride visions but as a cinematic metaphor it has already been turned inside out. In the new technological head-trip thrillers like The Matrix eXistenZ and The Thirteenth Floor virtual reality isnt the world you escape to; its the world youre already living in. You still strap on that headset (or plug into that nasty-looking bioport) only now its to brainwash yourself out of your illusions. Leave it to the cyberobsessive late 90s to take all the fun out of getting away. In The Thirteenth Floor the hero (Craig Bierko) a fearless mind-leap jockey enters the world of 1937 Los Angeles a silvery panorama of classic cars and smoky posh nightclubs. As he wanders through this mirage he gawks at the extraordinary tactile reality of it all. Those of us actually watching the film may find it hard to identify since what we see appears to be little more than a cliche period movie set. Still The Thirteenth Floor is out to wow you with its multilevel gamesmanship. The films vintage L.A. isnt real and neither it turns out is the computer bunker where this virtual metropolis was cooked up. So what is real? Only the head-scratching boredom of the audience as the film collapses from one meaningless false-bottom environment to the next. The surest sign that The Matrix was on to something -- at least before it turned into an anti-gravity kung fu blowout -- is that its vision of society blinded by a corporation-controlled image culture could be so narrowly misinterpreted even by its fans as a sci-fi projection of the Internet. Like The Truman Show the movie was about the real virtual reality the spiritual mall weve all tacitly agreed to live in. The Thirteenth Floor on the other hand is a series of Chinese boxes enclosing a void. The characters keep popping up in dual-reality roles and the different wardrobes just make them seem like ciphers in search of a screen test. Armin Mueller-Stahl as the brilliant innovator of all this techno-facade nonsense wrings such familiar weary melancholy out of his continental presence that hes starting to look like a highly evolved hologram. Hes the perfect actor for a movie like The Thirteenth Floor -- a virtual one-man Old Europe.
