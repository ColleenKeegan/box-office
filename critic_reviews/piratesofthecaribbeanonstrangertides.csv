Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review 2011 A Directors Odyssey Terrence Malicks overblown goofy slightly ridiculous The Tree of Life should be seen immediately. By David Edelstein Published May 20 2011 ShareThis Jessica Chastain Tye Sheridan and Brad Pitt in The Tree of Life.  (Photo Merie Wallace/Courtesy of 20th Century Fox) In his fifth feature The Tree of Life the visionary director Terrence Malick uses every cinematic tool under heaven to trace the connections between the fleeting and the infiniteand if that sounds fancy then Lord you aint heard nothing yet. This is Malicks big one his long-gestating answer to 2001 and Paradise Lost and its wedded to his (maybe) autobiographical Oedipal family drama of life in the fifties in Texas under a brutish but increasingly impotent father (Brad Pitt) and a diaphanously beautiful mother (Jessica Chastain) who embodies the spirit of Grace. Im not reading into it She ruminates in voice-over on the way of Grace versus the way of Nature which will make things a lot easier for students writing papers. There is the suggestion of a narrative The protagonist is a boy Jack OBrien (Hunter McCracken) of increasingly wayward emotions who adores his mom and wishes aloud for his dad to die. But its better to think of The Tree of Life as a Transcendentalist church pageant in which the players whisper questions to the Almighty after the death of a son and brother (Where were You? How did I lose You?)followed by nothing less than the birth of the universe the beginning of cellular life some dinosaurs and then children swimming into the Garden of Eden that is Waco. And its all filtered through the memory of Jack as a grown-up (Sean Penn) seen both in a glass-and-steel metropolis and on the rocky vaguely primordial beach that represents his inner world. After warming up with The Thin Red Line and The New World Malick has succeeded in fully creating his own film syntax his own temporal reality and lo it is kind of goofy. But riveting. Malicks vantageand that of his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezkiis the oddest combination of the archetypal and the impressionistic with a lot of trailing after the characters and then hovering. Pitt who co-produced the film and had to speak for Malick when the director blew off a Cannes press conference put it well Malick is like a guy with a big butterfly net waiting for a moment of truth to go by. And those disconnected moments are woven together to make the film amazingly fluid. (There are five count em credited editors.) See Also Terrence Malicks Thirty-Three Years of Principal Filming  The Tree of Life Debuts at Cannes to Boos and Swoons Malick is often likened to Stanley Kubrick who meticulously composed his shots and often needed scores of takes to get exactly what he wanted. (He drove actors crazy.) If anything Malick is the anti-Kubrick. To help him design the long section in which the universe the Earth and life begin Malick turned to Douglas Trumbull best known for 2001 but this time the effects have spiritual depth. Trumbull has spoken of Malick hunting for the Tao those magical unexpected moments that no one could possibly design. But wait arent they designed? Some of them are closely inspired by the latest science. Most however are freaky. What is that image that launches each of the films sections? It appears to be the cosmos in its infancy yet the shape is angelic with an opening that could well be meant as a portal to heaven. Then come the undersea shots coil-like life forms blobby jellyfish hammerhead sharks Jar Jar Binks. Well hes not as repulsive as Jar Jar but hes somewhat anthropomorphized. Where Kubricks first section of 2001 built to a scene of an early human finding a tool with which to kill Malick shows a predatory dinosaur stopping himself from stomping a fallen dino to death. Its the first stirring of compassion. For a personal director though Malick can be curiously impersonal. No image is allowed to be non-archetypal. Low-angle shots of boys climbing a tree heavenward Thats a recurrent motif. So is water symbolizing birth and death. (The movie feels as if it were processed in amniotic fluid.) Chastain is a willowy redhead with bright eyes and skin so fair that you feel as if youre seeing into her soul. Her 2008 performance in Jolene was revelatoryshe has the potential to be a major actressand yet Malick turns her into an object the sort of ethereal creature on whom butterflies land. She and the other actors spend a lot of screen time tottering among trees looking bereft while the soundtrack serves up too many familiar chestnuts Brahms Smetana Mahler Holst and the de rigueur Ligeti in the mode of 2001. As the boy Jack McCracken is terrificmeaning good and terrifyingwith stuck-out ears that are perfect for a patriarch to twist and as the characters hormones kick in a hint of something wilder and more sexually violent. The Fall approaches. A boy drowns at a public beach another is badly burned and pretty soon Jack starts to play with BB guns. He and his buddies blow up a nest of eggs. (Why should I be good if You arent? he asks in voice-over.) Reptiles appear. Then Jack begins to gaze longingly at his ripely erotic mother and angrily at his square-jawed father. (Pitt plays the dad with the right mix of paternalism and emotional detachment.) Theres a dash of homoeroticism in a scene between Jack and the blond brother who we know is destined to die in his teens. (In a war? Its never clear.) Its tantalizing stuff suggesting the psychosexual underpinnings of all those Malick versions of heaven and hell. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 20 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English In the bloated world of movie franchises the law of diminishing expectations is far more a blessing than a curse. A grade-schooler could do the arithmetic The first film is a curiosity the second a disappointment the third a debacle and by the time the fourth waddles into view youve come to expect zilch. Cast member Penelope Cruz walks on stage before the premiere of ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" at Disneyland in Anaheim California May 7 2011. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters video Video Depp Cruz embrace Pirates roles Movies Pirates of the Caribbean 4 The official trailer Of course thats precisely when the blessing kicks in. Anticipate nothing and eureka a very little can seem like a whole lot. In Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides the bloat has a new director the camera has an added dimension the cast has a fresh villain and the script (uniquely in this franchise) has something that bears a loose resemblance to a discernible plot. Now apply the law and ahoy me hearties No. 4 is surprisingly not bad - its the little thats a lot. As always theres Johnny Depp too. When initially sighted his portrayal of Capn Jack Sparrow - kohled eyes gold teeth braided goatee foppish manner fey accent dreadlocks dripping more trinkets than a souvenir shop - was quite marvellously ensconced in the port of high camp. Inevitably in later outings the same shtick sailed off into the shallow waters of self-parody and so it remains - stuck but at least constant a vast bauble of a performance shorn of its marvel yet otherwise intact. Early on our pirate is spotted not on the blue sparkle of the Caribbean but in the grey hubbub of London. The spotting comes courtesy of a full-face 3-D close-up stark enough to have us playing dentist to those gold incisors. Turns out thats the signature shot of the new helmsman - Rob Marshall to be precise heretofore much loved by Oscar (if not me) for his musical stylings in Chicago and Nine. There his choreography was mediocre and here its no better - his work in the action sequences ranges from merely competent to tritely cluttered. And his taste for shrouding every second scene in murk shooting through a glass darkly makes for some serious squinting behind our plastic specs. But hes a whiz with the close-up and on a huge screen in three dimensions the human face proves a worthy visual experience. Two human faces each attractive and in flirtatious proximity are even worthier but more about that later. Back to London where Capn Jack soon lands in the company of King George himself (Richard Griffiths) plus that old foe Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush again sporting a peg leg these days along with his usual complexion of mottled parchment). Watch this trio closely - Griffiths Rush Depp all wigged up and vamping outrageously. Where lesser actors would merely chew the scenery they swallow and then spit it back out for admiration. Together these three set the performance meter at the level of a shriek and there the needle stays for the duration. As for that almost discernible plot it involves a race to everybodys favourite destination - the Fountain of Youth. A three-way race as it happens the Spanish in their galleons Barbossa in a British vessel and none other than the wicked Blackbeard on The Queen Annes Revenge. Enter Ian McShane whose stentorian tones are welcome anywhere - as in Deadwood the guy is terrific at serving up the Devil in the voice of God. Enter too Penelope Cruz as Angelica ostensibly Blackbeards ill-sired daughter but more to the point a piratess to Depps pirate. Seems they share a near-amorous history of ""stirrings not quite all the way to feelings"" which brings us to that 3-D close-up when their respective trinkets touch and for a shining second the air feels charged. Theres one other moment that approaches magic. A school of mermaids swims into the yarn not the sweet genus but the sirens of yore beckoning horny sailors down into the briny depths. The first to breach the water is Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) and that frame deserves freezing - the half-emerged creature is a pale vision of eerie loveliness. Alas when shes netted and carted off in a casket-sized aquarium the magic dissipates and the picture starts plodding again all the way to its rather pedestrian climax. So were left to savour these seconds to pretend that a little does go a long way. Yes included in our brief is the ever-popular game of spot-the-cameo. Keith Richards is easy and he even lingers long enough to deliver a pretty quotable line ""Does this face look like its been to the Fountain of Youth?"" Judi Dench is much more of a challenge. Drenched in powder and pomp the grand old Dame pops up in a London carriage. Shes there in a flash and then as quickly gone and her fleeting presence is exactly like the fleeting merit of this fourth galleon in the portly franchise It prompts stirrings not quite all the way to feelings.

Visually ambitious that bizarro sequel lost its bearings when it sent Capt. Jack Sparrow to a barren topsy-turvy realm. Seeming to call forth the spirit of star Johnny Depps friend Hunter S. Thompson it was gonzo and twisted but not particularly entertaining. Although this newest installment is dubbed ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" its less trippy -- and more old-fashioned fun. ""Pirates"" has never been as inspired as the franchises first adventure and ""On Stranger Tides"" doesnt alter this fact. But the ships course has been righted. Thar be treasures here. Capt. Sparrow and friends race to find the Fountain of Youth gleefully docks on the lighter end of the pirate continuum territory also occupied by Somalias high-seas marauders and the Denver Museum of Nature amp; Sciencess smart exhibition ""Real Pirates The Untold Story of the Whydah from Slave Ship to Pirate Ship"" (through Aug. 21). The new ""Pirates"" captain is Rob Marshall director of the on-screen musicals ""Chicago"" and ""Nine"" and the drama ""Memoirs of a Geisha."" Gone is Gore Verbinski who helmed the first three films (and directed Depp in the deranged and wonderful ""Rango""). Depp reminds us why Jack Sparrow has become one of the big screens indelible creations. His pirate is a fellow of double takes and old-school physical comedy He trips he teeters he hangs from rafters banners chandeliers. His sloshy walk his slurry speech his luck and pluck are all familiar but amusing once again. With the conclusion of the trilogys Elizabeth Swann/Will Turner love story -- and the loss of Keira Knightleys set mouth and verve -- franchise screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio needed a new and feisty female lead. Penelope Cruz plays Angelica daughter of Blackbeard and a pirate in her own right. She and Jack share a history. Though the pair are fun when crossing swords they dont ignite the screwball blaze until a teasing finale. That may be because Depp is so good doing the drag performance that is the Jack Sparrow Show he completes himself. Of course the whole popcorn enterprise invites a kind of ""Im a Thespian"" overacting. Brit Richard Griffiths has royally-poly fun as King George when he states seemingly with marbles in his maw that he wants to beat Spains ""melancholy monarch"" to the Fountain of Youth. Geoffrey Rush returns with plenty of arggh and bluster as the pirate Hector Barbossa. Hes lost a leg and the beloved ship the Black Pearl. Hes out for revenge and will do the dastardly thing of becoming a legit government-backed ""privateer"" if need be. Ian McShane gives Blackbeard as much menace as a goofball romp can handle. Theres also a subplot that teases star- crossed romance and religious faith by introducing a mermaid (lovely French actress Astrid Berges-Frisbey) to a missionary (Sam Claflin). Just a bit over two hours ""On Stranger Tides"" feels longer than it needs to be. A former dancer himself director Marshall has likened the action sequences to choreography. If so this films got too many dance numbers. Some are rollicking and amusing (Sparrows flight from the kings guard for one). Even so the best musicals never lose the storys emotional thread when they break into song and dance. Neither should action flicks. So thank the night-sky stars for Angelica. After a particularly extended series of action mayhem she reminds Jack -- and dazzled or bewildered audiences -- of their objectives two silver chalices a mermaids tear and then onward to the Fountain of Youth. Oh yeah thats right.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 19 2011 907 PM Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides I liked these movies better when you thought Capt. Jack Sparrow was gay. By Dana Stevens Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides Its hard to find a way into reviewing Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides the fourth installment in the blockbusting Disney franchise maybe because the movie is so exactly like what youd expect overlong (two hours and twenty minutes) overstuffed (with at least four separate beats that could count as endings) and extremely loud (the insistent inescapable score by Hans Zimmer he of the patented Inception BRAAAHHHM). Watching it is less an experience than a faint--yet earsplitting--reminder of experiences that you once had. Oh yes theres Johnny Depp as the mincing perpetually half-drunk Capt. Jack Sparrow. And darned if hes not still being pursued by his pirate nemesis Capt. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) now sporting a peg leg and working in service of the King of England. Some of the supporting players have changed (a moment of silence here for Bill Nighy as Davy Jones the octopus-faced villain of the second and third movies) but the familiar atmosphere of dank ship holds and rusty astrolabes prevails as does the piling-up of ever more hectic naval battles and CGI-augmented set pieces. This is also the first Pirates movie to be filmed in 3D which means that a lot of the seagoing clutter--swords skeleton hands cartloads of flaming coals--gets shoved into our faces with an enthusiastic frankness reminiscent of the early days of the medium. Advertisement On Stranger Tides--directed for the first time in the series by Chicagos Rob Marshall rather than Gore Verbinski--does kick off with a lively chase sequence in which a captured Jack Sparrow brought in chains before the English king (a memorably fey Richard Griffiths) manages to pull off a chandelier-swinging cream-puff-stealing double-horse-and-carriage-straddling escape through the streets of 18th-century London. But sprightliness gives way to turgidity as the main plot kicks in it seems the dread pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane) needs Jack Sparrows know-how to locate the Fountain of Youth. So he enlists his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz) an old flame of Jacks to seduce him into joining them aboard Blackbeards ship The Queen Annes Revenge. Meanwhile Barbossa follows in hot pursuit of the escaped Sparrow while the Spanish Armada attempts to reach the storied fountain first and stake its claim. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have been replaced by an even more insipid couple a Christian missionary (Sam Claflin) and a captured mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) who periodically grind the action to a halt by gazing trustingly into each others eyes. In the earlier Pirates films--especially the first one which I remember now with a perhaps too-burnished fondness--Depps Sparrow acted as a kind of shipboard jester popping up to crack wise from the sidelines. At this point in the series Depp is being asked to carry the whole film on his shoulders. He appears in virtually every scene and even plays his romantic moments opposite Cruz with semi-sincere angst which makes the audience nearly as uncomfortable as it makes the captain. (I much preferred when we could choose to believe that Sparrow was secretly gay.) Depps charm carries him a ways--even if his eyes occasionally betray an Id-rather-be-surfing distraction. But Jack Sparrow the protagonist lacks Jack Sparrow the onlookers genuine strangeness. His Errol Flynn dash Falstaffian cowardice and rock-and-roll debauchery no longer seem like character traits; theyre more like markers of brand identity. More than anything this kind of elephantine ""summer"" blockbuster now registers as a miracle of sheer logistics. I found myself spacing out during the swashbuckling sequences marveling at the months of grinding labor the countless wall-size spreadsheets that must have been required to round up all these extras on green-screen sets costume them block them supply them with food trucks and coffee urns and port-a-potties and then film (in 3D) and computer-animate and color-balance and endlessly bloody market this whole sensory onslaught. For a series so steeped in supernatural mumbo-jumbo Pirates of the Caribbean displays remarkably little sense of wonder (and a little bit less with each successive installment). Except for one moment in the climactic Fountain of Youth scene--when a single drop of enchanted water moves around on Sparrows hand independently as if it were sentient while he watches in amazement--I never once thought wow what a magical place Im being invited to visit. Pirates of the Caribbean 4 has CGI-animated water everywhere but only that one little drop to drink. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

But since his launch in 2003s Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl Jack has made what feels like a substantial down payment on eternity. Through sheer force of will and paycheck Johnny Depps glam-rock pirate has defied the reboots and recastings that have upended such contemporaries as Spider-Mans Peter Parker and has worn younger costars Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom into piratical retirement. Among his fellow headliners only Geoffrey Rush returns to sea for the franchises fourth film and he began the saga with the considerable advantage of already being dead. Increasingly it seems that like Keith Richards--upon whom Depp famously based the character--Jack Sparrow may be with us always a fading remnant made up of three parts irony to one part mascara. This latest weary wearisome installment bears the title Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides which is not strictly speaking accurate for all its shortcomings the movies predecessor Pirates of Etc. Etc. At Worlds End had moments of trippy grandeur--the morphing ""stone crabs"" the beached carcass of the Kraken--that the current film makes little effort to match. Indeed in contrast to the wide narrative detours and convolutions of the first three films On Stranger Tides is a relatively direct voyage from Point A to Point B. The former is London where Jack and longtime crewmate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) try to evade execution; the latter Ponce de Leons legendary Fountain of Youth (which it must be noted bears a striking resemblance to the Isla de Muerta treasure cavern of the first film). Along the way new adversaries and inamoratas arrive to replace those whove fallen by the wayside. Chief among these are the comely Angelica (Penelope Cruz) long ago seduced and abandoned by Jack and--you had to see this coming--Blackbeard the mystic pirate-lord (Ian McShane) who inherits the plot functions of Bill Nighys Davey Jones though not his tentacles. Directed by Rob Marshall from a script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio On Stranger Tides is the shortest film of the series and the least expensive since the first. But as much as I would like to say that these reductions prove advantages they do not. The second and third entrants in the franchise may have been bad but they were ambitiously bad displaying a commitment to their overwrought mythologies and interminable reversals--the ship-swappings the hostage-takings--that few viewers could match. The new movie by contrast has the feel of a TV drama renewed for one season too many a last furtive run at the till before it closes for business. In accordance with the prevailing dictate the movie is presented in 3-D and the muddy visuals (exacerbated by the fact that most of the scenes are set at night) present an object lesson in the drawbacks of the format. The plot which involves a race to acquire the ingredients needed to perform a life-giving ritual at the Fountain manages to be at once straightforward and plodding. Though there are smatterings of wit and whimsy (for instance Jacks novel approach to untying himself from a palm tree) they show up with diminished frequency. And the one moment when the film offers a hint of genuine beauty and narrative tension--as the seductive song of a mermaid pulls sailors toward the waves--is exactly that a moment and one quickly undone by a rowdy bout of second-rate CGI action. The aura of half-heartedness extends to the performances as well. Rushs portrayal of Jacks ally-antagonist Barbossa was far more lively back when the character was undead. And despite the evident talents of Cruz and McShane their roles have a perfunctory quality haphazardly introduced and never transcending the narrative slots into which theyve been fitted. Its a rare film that can dim the fires of Cruz in particular but On Stranger Tides insistently defies combustion. As for Depp his Captain Jack initially a figure of such fierce originality has inevitably succumbed to self-caricature. The mumbling the mincing the emphatic popping of dark-rimmed eyes--its all acquired the air of vaudeville or a rundown drag act. When at the conclusion of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie Jack muttered a few lines of ""A Pirates Life for Me"" it was easy to share the sentiment. But when he makes the same case more directly at the conclusion of On Stranger Tides--""Its a pirates life for me savvy?""--it carries a whiff of desperation. Live whatever life you must Jack Sparrow but spare the rest of us.

Twitter previousPicture of the Day The Sombrero GalaxynextThe Rapture Is Not Saturday; Its Tonight Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

Id never caught Captain Jack Sparrow doing that before Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides but theres a new director at the helm this time -- Rob Marshall who made the musical Chicago -- and I guess he wants you to be aware of his action choreography. So in setting up an early Captain Jack escape from a palace interrogation Marshall draws your attention -- and Johnny Depps -- to the respective positions of a window a chandelier and a gilded chair. Only then does he find an excuse for Depp to swish into action an exchange of insults with the foppishly overdressed Captain Barbosa who is now a royal flunky that ends with Depp kicking food off a long banquet table hurling that gilded chair through a window swinging from the chandelier and eventually ending up on the street. There he evades British soldiers by plunging into an 18th-century version of rush hour -- horse-drawn carriages coaches and coal carts zooming every which way as Depp leaps from moving roof to moving roof. Its the kind of thing you can imagine Gene Kelly turning into a real tour-de-force except hed have insisted on doing it in one take not with stunt doubles and chopped-up editing. Still its frenetic and thats all most Pirates audiences expect anymore right? Apart from choreographed action heres whats different this time Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are gone. Cant say I miss them but apparently the producers thought someone might so theyve been replaced by an equally bland chaplain (Sam Claflin) and mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey). This being the first post-Twilight installment in the Pirates franchise its mermaids are all vampires. (Wouldnt you love to have been present at that story conference?) Captain Barbosa has acquired a peg leg (explained in a late-film lull) as well as a new nemesis Blackbeard (Ian McShane) who helms the worlds grimiest pirate ship. Penelope Cruz arrives in disguise playing Jacks former flame (again details are brushed in late) with lots of swagger and not much heat. The picture has been shot in 3-D presumably to add depth to Cruzs cleavage. (OK thats not the real reason. More likely someone thought those 3-D glasses would darken the special effects sequences and disguise how labored they are.) Speaking of labored lets discuss the plot. The Fountain-of-Youth quest in On Stranger Tides has been touted by the director as reducing clutter in a series that has previously made clutter a point of style. And it does result in one long voyage rather than lots of little side trips and in a through line that is admittedly clearer this time. But making things clear in a franchise based on a theme-park ride just has the effect of making the film seem best suited for youngsters -- who may well freak out over those vampire mermaids. Small kids wont really appreciate Johnny Depp either though frankly hes getting to be less fun as the series ages possibly realizing that whats riskiest in Pirates 4 isnt walking the plank but jumping the shark. Not that producer Jerry Bruckheimer is ever going to sink this treasure hunt -- worldwide grosses 2.6 billion and counting -- as long as Depp is game to come back on board. On Stranger Tides ends with a post-credits tease for the next episode in whats apparently going to be a whole second trilogy. By the end of which well be ready for ... what?

Jack Sparrow embarks on another adventure in Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides. By Peter Rainer Film critic May 20 2011 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Disney Johnny Depp left Penelope Cruz right and Ian McShane background are shown in a scene from "" Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides."" Peter Mountain/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Since I am still recovering from ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" - is it over yet? - I cant say I was much in the mood for ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides."" On the other hand there was no place to go but up - way up - and so I can cheerfully report that I only glanced at my watch about 20 times as opposed to 200 times for its predecessor.Part of the reason for this however may be because this new installment in the unceasing ""Pirates"" franchise is in 3-D and wearing those glasses makes its much more difficult to look at your watch.In a pleasant change of pace this sequel isnt altogether incomprehensible. I could actually follow the story such as it is; in fact I was often one step ahead of the story. There are few shocks to the system here. Even the ""surprise"" appearance of Keith Richards as the scurvy father of Johnny Depps Captain Jack Sparrow has already been hyped to death in the advance press. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Richards is no less welcome for that. Depp is on record as crediting the rocker as the model for Jacks tottering body language and seeing the two of them together each trying to outdo the others wigginess is blissfully funny. Plus Richards has the best line in the movie. There arent all that many good ones. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Rob Marshall who previously directed ""Chicago"" and ""Nine"" appears to have approached ""Pirates"" as a species of musical minus the musical numbers. The sword fights and mutinies and all the rest of the yo-ho-ho-ing are choreographed to the max. He keeps things moving without turning the film into a perpetual-motion machine on steroids. (I wasnt kidding. Is ""At Worlds End"" over yet?)The plot centers on the search for the fabled Fountain of Youth. This is a search many people of a certain age (i.e. over 30) in Hollywood are already quite familiar with. Jack now faces not only an old adversary - Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) returned from the dead and working for His Majestys Royal Navy - but a brand-new bad guy Blackbeard (Ian McShane) whose crew consists of zombies. Theres also Blackbeards daughter Angelica who has a fraught history with Jack and is definitely not a zombie. She is supposedly a master of disguises but since she is played by Penelope Cruz whose beauty is impossible to disguise even beneath false moustaches and an overload of greasepaint her specialty was lost on me.Cruz is clearly in the movie to spice things up but things are still pretty chaste throughout. Maybe thats because Cruz was pregnant during filming or more likely its because Marshall and his screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio no doubt taking their cue from uberproducer Jerry Bruckheimer have been careful to keep things kid-friendly. Of the four ""Pirates"" movies ""On Stranger Tides"" seems the least strange. (The most outre sequence features a bevy of mermaids who seem to have washed in from a La Jolla swimsuit competition.)Previously Depp played Jack with more than a hint of goosey depravity. Here he mostly mugs. Perhaps he no longer feels the need to extend himself. For too long now Depp one of our most audacious actors has coasted on playing bizarro characters - Jack Willie Wonka the Mad Hatter. Hes amusing in these films occasionally daring but one longs for him to reenter the real world. Hes turning into a stunt actor.With further sequels already in the works and billions more to be made I would nevertheless like to point out that the wind went out of these pirate ship sails a long time ago. In olden times movies didnt get sequelized beyond two or three installments. Now its the gift that keeps on giving - even if the gift box is empty. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action/adventure violence some frightening images sensuality and innuendo.)

Sony Pictures Classic By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 20 2011 1201 a.m. ET In Woody Allens beguiling and then bedazzling new comedy nostalgia isnt at all what it used to be--its smarter sweeter fizzier and ever so much funnier. From the first note of music over a dark screen--a soprano saxophone played by some ghost of Sidney Bechet--""Midnight in Paris"" teases us into expecting nothing more or less than a charming pastiche of the bits and pieces that pop up in many Woody Allen films. The jazz score from another era introduces scenes of the city--not Manhattan in black-and-white splendor but Paris under a bright summer sun. Then a troubled writer makes his appearance--not the blocked novelist played by Josh Brolin in last years ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" but Gil a hack screenwriter played by Owen Wilson who wants to be a novelist. (He and his prickly fiancee Inez played by Rachel McAdams have joined her parents on what began as a business trip for her father.) To round out the familiar cast of archetypes theres Michael Sheens insufferable Paul a poseur who insists that Versailles means ""a place where the weeds have been pulled."" Watch a clip from ""Midnight in Paris"" starring Owen Wilson Rachel McAdams and Kathy Bates. The conflicts are also familiar and entertaining. The earnestly liberal Gil argues back and forth with his prospective father-in-law a conservative Republican who takes a dim view of him as well as his politics. Paul dismisses Gils nostalgia for a Paris that no longer exists as nothing but denial of the painful present. The name for this malady he announces is ""golden-age thinking."" All of that is well and good but this 44th film written and directed by Mr. Allen--imagine 44 films over four decades--has better poissons to saute. The plot flips at midnight when Gil a solitary wanderer lost in a maze of cobblestone streets spots a black-and-yellow apparition coming around a corner--a huge old Rolls-Royce filled with expat revelers. And not just a Rolls but a magic coach that might have come from a Cocteau fantasy. Once Gil joins the revels his tipsy befuddlement escalates to the innocent astonishment that Mr. Wilson has done so well in the past and does superlatively in Gils present which is interwoven with the fabled past of the Ville-Lumiere. Im starting to write in circles here because Im conflicted myself I dont want to spoil any surprises but I do want to convey the sense of joyous delight that flows from the films time-hops. Maybe the best way of getting into it is by noting that Gil was also the name of the movie actor played by Jeff Daniels in one of my favorite Woody Allen films--one of my favorite films period--""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" The magical moment of that achingly lyrical fantasy comes when Gils character an intrepid archaeologist steps out of the screen and into Mia Farrows grim Depression-era life. In ""Midnight in Paris"" lyricism yields though not entirely to the scintillating lunacy of a wannabe writer stepping into another era and finding himself in the midst of the writers and artists he has worshipped as gods. Cocteau is only one of many. The pianist singing songs with phenomenal lyrics--""in shallow shoals English soles do it""--isnt just a pianist. An American poet introduces himself as Tom. The alpha literary lion of the milieu is Corey Stolls Ernest (Im going along with the first-name-only game played by the credits) a somber self-mythologist who speaks about love and death in run-on sentences and keeps trying to pick fights. Mr. Fitzgeralds hair is impeccably marcelled while Mrs. Fitzgeralds psyche is so tangled that Gil gives her a Valium. (Shes played brilliantly by Alison Pill.) Kathy Bates is not just hilarious shes eerily convincing as Gertrude who of course has Pablos portrait of her hanging in her salon. (Speaking of the dour Pablo Ernest says ""Hes great but hes no Miro."") Gils presence is readily accepted by Adrien Brodys Salvador as well as by Salvadors friends Man and Luis; they see no problem with someone living in two worlds because theyre surrealists. Mr. Allen offers this inspired nonsense with the casual aplomb of an absurdist; its all so silly and such wonderful fun. That changes though when he brings on Adriana an aspiring fashion designer and sometime mistress of various painters in town Pablo among them. Shes as real as the marvelous Marion Cotillard can make her which is to say intensely and for Gil sublimely Adriana is everything his fiancee isnt with the added attraction of being a legend. And through their adventure in another magic coach ""Midnight in Paris"" reconsiders Pauls diagnosis. When was the golden age and why didnt we get to live in it? Its a serious question that the movie has the good grace to take whimsically though theres no contest photographically between present and past. The superb cinematographer Darius Khondji floods his vistas of daytime Paris with light thats gentle but banal while Anne Seibels production design turns several coins de rue into vaguely cheesy movie sets. In the nighttime Paris that Gil explores the colors are rich the shadows are deep the mists promise mystery and serpentine alleys invite the sort of dreamy meanders that suit Gil so well. (Annoyed by his romantic affection for soft summer showers Inez asks early on ""Why does every city have to be in the rain?"" One answer is that cameras love the look of wet pavements.) At the same time the movie gives todays Paris a boost by populating it with women whose intelligence and sensitivity are equal to their beauty. One of them a guide at the Rodin Museum is played by Frances First Lady Carla Bruni. (More than a piquant cameo its a pleasing performance.) Another Lea Seydouxs Gabrielle sells antiques at an outdoor stand and values Gil as a customer with special tastes. ENLARGE Johnny Depps Jack Sparrow accompanied by redcoats in Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides. Disney Actors have always been eager to work with Mr. Allen; heres another demonstration of why. Every member of the cast shines at varying intensities Ms. McAdams as a young almost-married whos lively and attractive albeit a scold; Kurt Fuller as Inezs acidulous father; Mimi Kennedy as her dryly sarcastic mother; and in lesser roles Nina Arianda Tom Hiddleston Daniel Lundh and Michel Vuillermoz. But this is Mr. Wilsons picture. Practiced though his trademark naivete may be its entirely fresh once again because hes so good at playing such a complex role. Gil is a bit of a goofball but he is also without knowing it the genuine artist he yearns to be. For the filmmaker who brought these intertwined universes into being the film represents new energy in a remarkable career. In recent years Mr. Allens output has been variable; a succession of small mostly agreeable entertainments punctuated by the disagreeable miscalculation of ""Whatever Works"" and the glorious madness of ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona."" Whats new about ""Midnight in Paris""--about its cheerful shallows along with its unstressed depths--is the lovely unseriousness of the whole venture. Just as Luis Bunuel did Woody Allen is growing more playful as he gets older. His new movie truly is a place where the weeds have been pulled. Everything comes up roses. Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides ""Its not the destination so much as the journey"" Johnny Depps Captain Jack Sparrow declares in this latest addition to the theme park ride. For me it was not so much the journey as the destination--the curtained opening beneath the Exit sign--so Im not the one to say whether this film is better or worse than the previous one. Its definitely shorter and more coherent Jack and Geoffrey Rushs Barbossa both sail off to find the Fountain of Youth but Ian McShanes Blackbeard is after it too and not just Blackbeard and his crew of zombies but his daughter Angelica who is played by Penelope Cruz with a what-am-I-doing-here expression on her face. (She looks cute with a moustache.) Watch a clip from ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" starring Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz and Geoffrey Rush. Keith Richards in another cameo as Captain Teague asks ""Does this face look like its found the Fountain of Youth?"" Nope it does not. Mr. Depp fulfills his flouncing quota though his deadpan sometimes goes completely dead. The movie was written by ""Pirates"" stalwarts Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Theyre funny guys and the script might well be funny too but its hard to tell from the metronome rhythms set for the actors by the director Rob Marshall and by the editors working as galley slaves under their producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I did like an elaborate swarm of mermaids especially the one who washes up on the movies shores; her name is Syrena with a ""y"" to distinguish her from common sirens and shes played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey. But the IMAX print I saw was so murky as to make you give thanks for the few scenes shot in simple sunlight the 3-D wasnt worth the bother and never before have I wanted to chloroform an entire orchestra. DVD FOCUS Wedding Crashers (2005) Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are John and Jeremy motor-mouthed con men who crash wedding receptions to pick up girls. In the opening scene set in an office where the longtime friends maintain a dubious practice as divorce mediators an aggrieved husband laces into his wife who replies furiously ""You shut your mouth when youre talking to me"" This tidbit of skewed logic is only one bright moment of many in a film blessed with language thats sharply honed if often raunchy. Rachel McAdams is a bridesmaid Claire with whom John falls hopelessly in love. La Vie en Rose (2007) Marion Cotillard won an Oscar for her astonishing performance as the tortured impassioned Edith Piaf. In the spirit of Piafs signature song I regret nothing about ""La Vie en Rose""--not the narrative confusion the sketchy details or the lack of historical context. Olivier Dahans long harrowing and phantasmagorical biopic doesnt bother with such events as World War II which slips by unnoticed. This isnt negligence but a reflection of Piafs point of view. Her life was only about singing and searching for love. And always the songs she sang with the intensity of a cyclotron beam. Broken Embraces (2009) Penelope Cruz does her best to act badly during several passages in Pedro Almodovars tragicomedy but her effort is doomed to failure. Shes magnificent even when her performance is supposed to be clumsy and those passages arent what they seem anyway. Theyre part of a wonderfully elaborate joke in a film that serves as a love letter to the movies and a demonstration of the mediums mysterious power. Ms. Cruzs Lena is part of a quadrangle that involves a blind Spanish screenwriter and former director an ominously amorous tycoon and the former directors production assistant. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Starring Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz Geoffrey Rush Director Rob Marshall Running time 217 Release Opened May 20 2011  Editorial Review Sail on o ship of Johnny DeppBy Ann HornadayFriday May 20 2011Watching ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" is to be reminded of 2003 when many skeptics (including yours truly) approached the first installment with a combination of suspicion and outright cynicism. A movie based on a theme park ride? How good could it be?Plenty good as it turned out. And in a similar fashion the fourth installment dispels many fans trepidation regarding sequels and the diminishing returns they so often represent. The legions of filmgoers who have made the ""Pirates"" movies such a box office behemoth neednt worry. ""On Stranger Tides"" feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails.Anchored by a playfully androgynous Johnny Depp as the ever-cheeky Captain Jack ""On Stranger Tides"" marks the return of stock ""Pirates"" players Geoffrey Rush (as Sparrows beloved nemesis Hector Barbossa) and Kevin R. McNally as friend and confederate Joshamee Gibbs. And it welcomes two new characters to the fold who slip into its fanciful sometimes gently ribald world with uncanny ease Ian McShane -- who with ""Deadwood"" and a slew of nasty Brit crime thrillers has found his niche playing menacingly oleaginous villains -- delivers an appropriately ruthless turn as the notorious Blackbeard. And Penelope Cruz -- arriving by way of a wittily clever entrance -- delivers an appropriately smoldering turn as a mysterious pirate named Angelica whose storied past with Jack becomes clear in a few neat expository strokes.In fact the whole of ""On Stranger Tides"" could be described as appropriate clear and neat as first-time ""Pirates"" director Rob Marshall swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism the series has come to stand for. Starting with a smartly staged escape from King Georges castle and a rollicking carriage chase through the London streets ""On Stranger Tides"" delivers its whammies with metronomic regularity and on at least two occasions genuine ingenuity Marshall who started life as a choreographer in musical theater brings those gifts strongly to bear on a stunt in which a mutinous crew is hung by their ships lines swinging and dangling with balletic grace. Later a group of men watch mesmerized as an ethereal school of mermaids encircles their boat their sinuous movements enchanting the audience just as seductively. (Note to caretakers of small children Little ones may find this scene frightening when the fish-ladies turn out to be part piranha.)As with so many 3-D movies these days that added technological dimension doesnt add anything particularly memorable to ""On Stranger Tides"" apart from the odd outstretched sword or skeletal hand. But nor does it detract from the movies palette and visuals which are consistently bright vivid and clean. The result rather than a series of ""watch out"" stunts is a movie that more closely resembles a spiffy childs pop-up book which is altogether appropriate considering its childlike tone and Peter Pan-like protagonist.Actually make that Peter Pan with a dash of Keith Richards and the flouncy sashay of a ""La Cage aux Folles"" refugee. With his dreadlocks tipsy line readings and kohl eyeliner (can anyone rock a smoky eye like Johnny?) Depp still brings verve and nerve to the role that has solidified his standing as a bona fide international superstar giving ""On Stranger Tides"" every campy bit hes got when a lesser actor would be phoning it in. His commitment and energy extends to the entire production which unlike so many sequels these days (cough ""Sex and the City 2"" cough) has put the fans first and given them something both familiar and novel.Is ""On Stranger Tides"" great storytelling? Not by a league Sparrow and his crew spend most of the movie trudging through a verdant jungle looking for the Fountain of Youth. The plot is well plotty sprouting ancillary tendrils and characters with fecund but pointless abandon. Having apparently audited a class at the Michael Bay School of Narrative Structure Marshall tends to resolve too many scenes with an oncoming fireball.But those are quibbles; the team behind ""On Stranger Tides"" should be congratulated for knowing and honoring their core audience delivering the proper ratio of action humor adventure and bodice-ripping they require to feel well served. Depp Cruz Marshall -- as well as at least one wittily apt cameo performer who shall go nameless -- deliver the winning recipe with precision and brio. A fifth movie based on a movie based on a theme park ride? Whos counting?Contains intense sequences of action/adventure violence some frightening images sensuality and innuendo.

"Pirates On Stranger Tides in precarious position - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Pirates On Stranger Tides in precarious position By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Such an excess amount of piracy has been wrung out of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise that assessing this fourth installment can be reduced to movie-sequel math. By Peter Mountain Disney Enterprises Captain Jack (Johnny Depp) attempts a quick getaway in On Stranger Tides. He also swings from chandeliers and battles blood-sucking mermaids. EnlargeClose By Peter Mountain Disney Enterprises Captain Jack (Johnny Depp) attempts a quick getaway in On Stranger Tides. He also swings from chandeliers and battles blood-sucking mermaids. Heres how it goes down 4 is better than 3 about the same as 2 and worse than 1. The maiden voyage of Pirates of the Caribbean was an undeniably fresh surprise back in 2003. But the sequels have felt in varying degrees as soggy as a ships planks after a storm. This time Penelope Cruz joins the buccaneers as a crafty and sensual pirate. One thing is clear Cruz as the spirited Angelica and Johnny Depp as mincing Captain Jack Sparrow have far better chemistry than Depp did with Angelina Jolie in last years dreadful The Tourist. VIDEO See the Tides trailer PHOTO Gallery of Pirates MORE Jack Pirates 4 on a mission Depp does his best to breathe life in a gasping-for-air role that once felt inspired. He seems to have more fun than in the last couple go-rounds and his wit is sharper. But the script doesnt add colors to the characters. Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa goes through the motions. The limitations of the role seem all the more obvious after watching his nuanced portrayal of the speech therapist in The Kings Speech. It should be noted that at 2 hours and 17 minutes this is the shortest of the four movies. Score points for new director Rob Marshall (Chicago) replacing Gore Verbinski who directed the first three. Marshalls choreographic skills are an asset particularly in staging an early exciting chase sequence where Sparrow nimbly eludes King George II (Richard Griffiths). The worlds favorite pirate dangles from ropes swings on chandeliers and leaps atop carriages. Later he has a lively swordfight with Angelica who we learn is an old flame. Jack has lost his beloved ship the Black Pearl and is intent on getting it back. Others around him are bent on finding the Fountain of Youth. The two goals converge. Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and a crew of zombies figure into the proceedings. Despite these baddies the voyage to reach the fountain grows listless. About the movie Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides   out of fourStars Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz Geoffrey Rush Ian McShane Director Rob Marshall Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action/adventure violence some frightening images sensuality and innuendo Running time 2 hours 17 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Women play a bigger part than in episodes 1-3. Pirates are menaced by bloodsucking mermaids -- for those whose taste for screen vampires simply cant be satiated. Another departure from the first three movies Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are nowhere to be found. But there is a love story involving young hotties specifically missionary Philip (Sam Claflin) and Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) a less-bloodthirsty mermaid. She is taken prisoner by the pirates because her tears activate the Fountain of Youth. Did we mention the story is nonsensical? This is the first of the franchise shot in 3-D but those glasses come into play only about five times when swords get brandished directly into the camera. Familiar and predictable this Pirates reboot is often incoherent and crammed with pointless details. The more sequels spun off the clearer it becomes that one movie about these swashbucklers would have sufficed. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Photo ( ) ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides."" (AP) Cutlasses flash music swells mast sways critic yawns. Sure ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" be a lusty yarn of the waves. And tis as average as the sea is deep. ""Pirates"" 4 is not as bad as ""Pirates"" 3. (Some other things that are not as bad as the 2007 excursion which by coincidence was also 2007 minutes long rickets gangrene intermediate-stage leprosy.) The previous entry had a habit of pitching and yawing on waves of exposition (""Parley"" usually signaled time to go out for a beer and maybe not come back as minutes of screen time were spent quibbling over some footnote in the pirate rulebook). The exposition problem this time is less irritating but still present. When the explication lets up the action scenes and banter meet minimum acceptable blockbuster standards but thats all you can say for them. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has an amusing entrance in disguise as a judge who rules on the case of his sidekick Gibbs (Kevin McNally). In a typical example of the movies half-baked thinking (which starts with the title -- meaningless but cool-sounding like the name of a cologne) Jack sentences Gibbs to death then hops into his prison carriage with him promising that both will escape because a guard has been bribed. Wouldnt it have been easier to just find Gibbs innocent and walk away with him? No because we need for Jack to be double-crossed and hatch a crafty escape. This involves swinging on a chandelier and running across a buffet table set for the king of England who wants to put Jack under the direction of his old nemesis Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on a mission to find the Fountain of Youth before the Spaniards do. Fleeing like a Looney Tunes Errol Flynn Capt. Jack runs into his father (Keith Richards) who offers more exposition You need two silver chalices to drink from the Fountain of Youth. Richards is as wasted here as he was in about 1975 Youve got two of the most charismatic entertainers of the last 50 years and all that happens is a little back-story delivery? Watching these two performers have a sandwich together would be vastly more entertaining than the movie. Meanwhile a rival ersatz Jack Sparrow is hiring a crew to go after the Fountain and after a comical sword fight the phony Jack turns out to be his old girlfriend Angelica (Penelope Cruz). It isnt hard to see what the attraction is Think of all the mascara secrets they must share. A drawback is that her dad is Blackbeard (Ian McShane) who is to other pirates what pirates are to clergymen. Sparrow leads a goofy mutiny against Blackbeard yet the old captain keeps him around to help find the Fountain. PHOTOS JOHNNY DEPPS LEADING LADIES The jokes bob along at a fourth-grade level Jack calls His Highness ""your heinie"" and during an argument that involves a Christian proselytizer says ""I support the missionary position."" The attention span in the story is also more middle school than midshipman The officers on Blackbeards ship are said to have ""Zombiefied"" though nothing ever comes of this and Blackbeard can do magic but apparently prefers not to. He does a couple of nifty tricks when we first meet him and then no more reference is made to his dark arts. I suppose you have to give credit to the movie for coming up with some badass killer mermaids. As photographed from underneath their swishing tails are spectacularly sinister -- Jaws meets Ariel. But most of the sword fights and other set pieces lack excitement. Director Rob Marshall who did the musicals ""Chicago"" and ""Nine"" seems to think that Broadway-style fakery is good enough. I picture the actors being told ""Look just dash around knocking swords together for a couple of minutes. We got Hans Zimmer to score this thing hell make it seem thrilling."" Nameless interchangeable extras -- we dont even see their faces -- tumble like autumn leaves as the principals parry and thrust. The music goes DUNT DUNT DUNT. And the love story goes CLANK CLANK CLANK. The missionary played by an Orlando Bloom-ish cover boy named Sam Claflin falls in love with one of the mermaids and while making goo-goo eyes they ladle out offerings from the Fountain of Cliche. The first ""Pirates"" was one of the finest blockbusters of the decade and the second one wasnt bad. But its the newest episode that made me feel like a kid again -- bored stuck waiting for something more interesting to come along. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next NBC Sports chief Ebersol resigns Read Next NBC Sports chief Ebersol resigns Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 40527 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20897 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 13811 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pirates-of-the-caribbean-on-stranger-tides ) Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides (United States 2011) May 19 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in IMAX 3-D. The fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie represents a perfect encapsulation of what the summer sequel tent-pole has become a half-baked casserole of recycled elements from past installments of the franchise tossed together with lackluster action sequences (inspired by or designed for video games) and gratuitous special effects. The screenplay credited to Ted Elliott amp; Terry Rossio is little more than a clothesline from which to dangle all of the obligatory set pieces. This is one script that could have been assembled using a computer. Had that been the case however the result wouldnt have been as long-winded. The basic story is simple; its something of a wonder how much endless exposition and tedious dialogue Elliott amp; Rossio cram into the films bulging 137 minutes. Reviewing On Stranger Tides as a movie has limited value. The production will not make about a billion dollars (worldwide) because it has the elements viewers value from cinema. It like many summer blockbusters is designed to deliver a momentary adrenaline jolt while providing audiences with a few familiar characters and elements. All that will be remembered upon exiting the theater is that there are now four (instead of three) episodes in the franchise. On Stranger Tides exists mid-way between a video game and an amusement park ride (in this case the second part can be taken literally) and for those who arent looking for anything more it will probably succeed. I suspect that will represent a large percentage of those who pay out their hard-earned cash to see it projected theatrically (in 3-D IMAX 3-D or good old-fashioned 2-D). The existence of a fourth Pirates film was predicated upon the participation of Johnny Depp whose interest was piqued by a paycheck with a lot of zeroes in front of the decimal point. No one will begrudge Depp the huge windfall; he has paid his dues working for creative forces like Jim Jarmusch and Terry Gilliam. Still its a little disappointing that his contributions to On Stranger Tides are limited to the likeness and mannerisms of the campy and charismatic character he played on three previous occasions. Captain Jack might just as easily have been portrayed by an animated version of a Madame Tussauds waxwork dummy. On Stranger Tides opens an undetermined time after the conclusion of At Worlds End. Captain Jack accompanied by an old flame Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and her father Blackbeard (Ian McShane) is in search of the Fountain of Eternal Youth. There are two other groups involved in the race for the prize a small army of Spaniards and an English privateer captained by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). As with any quest its not just a matter of following a treasure map to the final destination. There are items that must be collected along the way - in this case two chalices and the tear of a mermaid. Several characters from the first three Pirates are back including Barbossa and Jacks right-hand man Gibbs (Kevin McNally). Not appearing are Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley. Surprisingly they are missed. Knightleys flirtations with Depp represented the best thing about Dead Mans Chest and throughout the first trilogy the two ""vanilla"" characters were the straight men to Captain Jacks clown. Without them the outrageous buccaneer is considerably less endearing. A couple of irrelevant secondary characters (a missionary and a mermaid) are introduced to add the element of romance subtracted by the removal of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner but they represent little more than a means by which the running time can be inflated. Jack is left interacting with Angelica but the only thing about Penelope Cruz in this role that isnt flat is her chest. Rob Marshalls direction is competent and from a technical standpoint theres nothing wrong with the various action sequences aside from the lack of excitement. For all his faults Gore Verbinski at least handled the action with panache. Those movies thrummed with derring-do. This one sinks. In many ways On Stranger Tides reminds me of another fourth installment Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The level of disappointment is perhaps muted because the wait between Pirates sequels has only been four years while Spielberg/Lucas/Ford kept us waiting for two decades. Still both movies are indications that the filmmakers should have stopped with a trilogy. Is it necessary to say anything about the 3-D? Having seen On Stranger Tides in IMAX 3-D Im convinced that the less expensive brighter and more colorful 2-D is the way to go. The 3-D gave me a mild headache (the first time that has happened) with the action sequences notably suffering from blur. Also since many of the scenes are dark it may sometimes be useful to remove the glasses to figure out whats happening. Maybe darkness isnt a bad thing for a quasi-amusement park ride. After all the lights are off for most of Space Mountain. The problem is theres no sense of motion in On Stranger Tides. As a movie On Stranger Tides would have to be considered a failure. The story does not engage the characters are stick figures the action sequences are perfunctory and the whole enterprise reeks of being a money-grab. Yet when seen through the prism of what is often proffered as ""summer entertainment"" its a relatively cheap way to numb the mind and dull the senses. With expectations properly adjusted maybe this Pirates of the Caribbean wont make you feel like youve been forced to walk the plank.

Photo Peter Mountain AP Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides Adventure. Starring Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz Geoffrey Rush and Ian McShane. Directed by Rob Marshall. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Captain Jack isnt really a character. He is a condition. He can never have a strong emotion or a strong need. He can never change. Other characters must deal with him as a monolith and if he ever were to alter or deepen the audience would practically consider it a breach of contract. So its a bit of a problem to find Johnny Depps Captain Jack at the center of ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides."" If you want to burden your movie from the outset give it a protagonist who cant grow cant change cant feel and wants nothing. Then give Depp total license to mug his way out of this confinement. Worse give him scenes opposite Geoffrey Rush who not only plays a pirate but one with a peg leg (Oh no Unfair advantage) and let them compete to see who can give the more grossly narcissistic and uninhabited performance. Depp wins but its close. Yet for all this misery this is by no means the worst of the ""Pirates"" movies. Director Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") may be too cowed by the success of the previous installments to try anything radically new but he tries - in the face of a script of almost willful ineptitude - to impose something approaching coherence. He also has the advantage of working with Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane who approach the movie as an acting job and not as a chance to flounce and preen. Theyre not at the center of the movie but theyre just off center and they help. Related Stories Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides If you see the movie watch Depp and Cruz in their scenes together and note the difference. Unlike Depp Cruz listens. Her focus is complete. And she finds an emotional through line amid the tangle of the story to give wholeness to the woman she plays. Angelica (Cruz) wants to find the Fountain of Youth. She wants it not for herself but for her father Blackbeard the Pirate (Ian McShane) who is not a very nice person. So her motivation is love with the complication that she might be in love with Captain Jack as well. But her loyalty is to her father. Thats what Cruz plays - every moment she is onscreen. Blackbeards loyalty is to himself. Single-minded and ruthless - something McShane can play as well as anybody - he wants the Fountain for the usual reason. He doesnt want to die. So thats what McShane plays. Actually a search for the Fountain of Youth might have been a strong organizing principle for the whole movie. It could have motivated Captain Jack either out of a desire to live forever or out of desire to control the Fountain with all the power that might bring. But no that would be too clear-cut. Instead the movie has Captain Jack in search of the Fountain ... for no reason. He is without motive. Moreover he keeps doing things against his own interests and against the interests of people who are on his side - again for no reason. This isnt absurdity. This is nonsense - and its as boring as nonsense. The action scenes are dull because you know who cant get killed ""Hold your fire I want him alive"" These scenes are even a little creepy because Captain Jack is going around killing people without need or purpose. The dialogue interludes are worse because theyre static The conversations almost invariably consist of characters explaining themselves or congratulating themselves for being themselves. Nothing happens. Nothing. Still the new ""Pirates"" is not all torture. There is an interlude involving mermaids that is eerie and unsettling a vision of monstrous allure and devouring sexuality. I wonder what Freud would have thought. And as long as Cruz and McShane are onscreen there is some humanity and emotional truth in the vicinity. Take it when you can get it. -- Advisory Mermaids with fangs. Trivialized murder. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Dead Mans Chest and At Worlds End meandered so far off course and took so long to get there that almost any Act 4 encore would qualify as a quantum leap forward. It didnt hurt that the movies scored a massive booty at the box office in the process.Thus we come to Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides a spectacle whose very mediocrity comes off as a virtue in light of the series preceding slogs. At 137 minutes its only moderately too long. With fewer ""What in the name of Jolly Roger is going on?"" plot tangles it doesnt make you want to whip out a compass or a narrative map. In coming to terms with its identity as disposable entertainment On Stranger Tides proves as painless and forgettable as the amusement park ride on which this whole treasure-grubbing enterprise is based.Johnny Depp of course is back as Captain Jack Sparrow still looking like a dandified white Rastafarian with a thing for mascara. As long as Depp is prancing about the screen slurring his words and executing interpretive dance moves theres little need to worry about story or direction. Thats fortunate because you wont find much of either.A collection of passable action set pieces in search of a tone Stranger Tides finds Captain Jack sailing as a prisoner of Blackbeard (the malevolent Ian McShane easily the best thing in the movie). The Beard is father to Angelica (Penelope Cruz in tomboy mode) with whom our rakish hero had a long-ago dalliance. Now theyre all sailing the seas and rumbling through the jungle in search of the Fountain of Youth.This premise yields two dividends. It provides the odd sensation that might come with a Disney production of Werner Herzogs Amazon epic Aguirre The Wrath of God (unfortunately without Klaus Kinski or all of those monkeys). And it allows the ravaged Keith Richards doing his requisite cameo as Jacks papa to utter the movies best line ""Does this face look like its been to the Fountain of Youth?""The 3-D is completely useless unless you work for the studio that reaps those few extra bucks per ticket. But its not impossible to shut down your senses and enjoy the ride (so to speak). McShane whether hes playing an English crime kingpin (Sexy Beast) an Old West gangster-entrepreneur (Deadwood) or a dark-hearted pirate never fails to deliver evil on a Shakespearean scale. A couple of chase scenes especially a frantic scramble from a school of hissing mermaids provide dashes of excitement.Most important this Pirates under the direction of Rob Marshall knows to keep things simple and acknowledge its own silliness. Mindless entertainment should never be hard to follow a lesson Stranger Tides takes to heart. In case you fear this is the end of the line for Captain Jack the wrathful Angelica offers words that any cash-happy outfit can live by ""This is not over."" Arrrgh.

This royal confab doesnt go well for Sparrow however and so after some tricky business in a London courtroom some lockups and escapes from jail and a chase through ye olde muddy streets Jack finds himself in the company of the one-time convent sister (if shes to be believed) who became his lover and now seems to be working for Captain Blackbeard or something like that. The Pirates franchise has never taken its back stories terribly seriously. Directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago Memoirs of a Geisha Nine) who shows himself capable of orchestrating elaborate set pieces and overseeing squads of special-effects teams On Stranger Tides is somewhat more buoyant than its two immediate forebears in this series. Depp sashays around as is his wont dropping bon mots and bawdy puns - and getting a chance to chew the fat with his inspiration for the role Keith Richards once again. Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbossa Jacks newly peg-legged rival who is leading his own expedition to Ponce de Leons legendary font. And so the race is on the Spaniards for one; Barbossa a ""privateer"" flying the Union Jack for two; and Sparrow and Angelica aboard Blackbeards Queen Annes Revenge for three. At a certain point when landfall is made and a school of CG mermaids start splashing and diving (and alas showing vampire-like fangs) On Stranger Tides falls into the dark effects-driven morass that made At Worlds End and Dead Mans Chest so torpid. (About those mermaids Pre-Raphaelite supermodels anyone?) Theres little if anything here to keep us emotionally invested and so the pile-it-on mutinies and sword fights and perilous dives off vertiginous cliffs exist just to wow us. And frankly the wow factor isnt that great. The quest for the Fountain of Youth - which requires the ritual deployment of a couple of silver chalices and a vial containing a mermaids tear - turns out to be just a salty dogs McGuffin.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Captain Jack Sparrow is essentially the Fonzie of the Pirates Of The Caribbean films the swaggering one-note flavor character who proved to be the series most popular element and quickly took over. Thats more obvious than ever in Pirates Of The Caribbean On Stranger Tides the first installment without director Gore Verbinski or romantic leads Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley The whole story now rests awkwardly on Sparrows narrow shoulders. Stranger Tides eventually produces a substitute naive romantic hero and a star-crossed love interest but thats a late-film development and a minor subplot among many others. For the most part Sparrow (Johnny Depp) swishes swans and swashbuckles through the center of the story trying to fill all the narrative roles himself which means hes by turns cowardly and bold selfish and self-sacrificing an egotistical monomaniac and a tenderhearted softie. Its like watching a one-man show where the roles keep changing. But much of the rest of the film remains consistent with the series to date Stranger Tides is another loose chain of big action setpieces this time centered on a quest for the Fountain Of Youth that draws in a Spanish expedition a British deputation (captained by series regular Geoffrey Rush) the pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his maybe-daughter (Penelope Cruz). Theres a little of the usual POTC changes of fortunes and changing of sides but Tides is generally a straightforward simple race to a goal with a lot of sword-fighting and special effects along the way. The series has needed this streamlining since the beginning--individual scenes drag on too long for the film to feel fleet or propulsive but at least the endless convoluted exposition is largely gone. And viewers engagement will depend entirely on their tolerance for Depps antics Apart from Cruz who throws herself lustily into her tough-seductress role the actors give negligible performances with McShane Rush and Keith Richards in a repeat cameo all playing nigh-identical smug glowerers. POTC was never about nuance and now its even less so Its about watching Depp fall into peril and wriggle his way out over and over for hours. Tides is a smaller film than past installments by design and necessity. Which often makes it feel lightweight but thats still better than bloated.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint For all its slam-bang adventure the new ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a very timid movie. It has sensational stunts epic scope baroque set design and superb special effects but not much wind in its sails. This episode feels like the fourth film in a trilogy wheezing along when it should leap relying on our affection for recurring characters rather than taking us on a bold new journey of discovery. Theres a chase or a brawl or a sword fight every couple of minutes but those knockabout scenes dont infuse the movie with the headlong momentum of the earlier entries. The rambunctious brawling feels like a nervous urge to keep the frame active. The actors know this is supposed to be a spoofy slapstick farce but director Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") -- stepping in for the original helmsman Gore Verbinski -- seems to have lost the map to the buried treasure. Instead he takes his cues from the Official Summer Blockbuster Franchise Playbook. When in doubt toss in an action sequence. The marquee attraction of course is Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow and audiences will forgive the film almost anything for a glimpse of his gold-toothed grin. Depp still radiates verve and prankish humor. In an early London scene Jack is dragged in chains before King George and remains unflappable in His Majestys presence. He improvises an elaborate escape from the palace involving a napkin a chandelier a pastry a passing coach a society womans pilfered earring and a flaming coal wagon. The bedlam is competently staged but its Depps pixilated bravado that truly sells it. His Jack is such an inspired amusing opportunist that his antics inspire almost immoral delight. Its good to end the royal audience on a high note because the scene eats up several minutes with chatter about Englands race to locate Ponce de Leons Fountain of Youth before the rival Spanish can claim it. Which brings us to the main course of the story the race to locate the fountain. Jacks old nemesis Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush whose drawling pirate inflections stroke each line of dialogue as if it were a kitten) has given up piracy to become a privateer serving the King. Angelica (Penelope Cruz) a spitfire old love of Jacks is in league with Blackbeard (Ian McShane the casting agents go-to bad man) a fearsome pirate and the master of impressive supernatural powers. Peter Mountain ASSOCIATED PRESS - AP Ian McShane portrays Blackbeard in ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" The race for the prize ought to lend the story an irresistible drive yet for long stretches the film seems to be sailing around in circles as unnecessary characters and gimmicks are introduced. This chapter drops sappy lovebirds Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley but drags in wimpish Sam Clafin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as a preachy young missionary and his beloved mermaid. Yes you read that right. With all these associates and relations and new-character narrative ballast aboard the story tootles along like a tugboat. The story has such a thrown-together quality that I spent more time puzzled than thrilled. Logic isnt just broken its smashed. How does Jacks dad (Keith Richards) appear at just the right instant to aid his impromptu palace escape? Why does Blackbeard stop using his sorcery just when the Fountain is within his grasp? Why didnt someone lock the screenwriters in a room until they came up with better verbal duels between Depp and Cruz? I admire Depps finesse and Rush is a treat but theres only so much that fresh performances can do to liven up lackadaisical material. The film smells of dead fish yet the now-mandatory post-credits scene seems to pave the way for a second trilogy. Didnt anyone learn from ""Star Wars The Phantom Menace""?

In this fourth installment of the franchise Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz generate some enjoyable chemistry as pirate rivals who were once lovers and the ""stranger tides"" of the title--ebbing through a South Seas lagoon that contains the Fountain of Youth--encompass such clever digital imagery as mermaid armies and waters that flow upward. This is eye-catching and forgettable in the patented Bruckheimer manner which means you should be entertained if youre not expecting anything new.

(Walt Disney Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday May 19 2011 815 AM Title Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides Even a maverick has to pay the bills right? While Johnny Depp has built himself an admirably eclectic resume a villa in the South of France doesnt run itself. Which means presumably that he cant take risks like ""Rango"" unless he occasionally pads his bank account with yet another overstuffed underwhelming ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" sequel. Perhaps director Gore Verbinski has a smaller mortgage as he wisely walked away after his third attempt. (Or maybe he just knew ""Rango"" which he also made would turn out well.) The new captain is Rob Marshall who scrapes off a few of the barnacles that clung to the last effort. But he cant avoid the feeling that this adventure has run aground. With Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley also gone Penelope Cruz has stepped in as Angelica the daughter of Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Together theyre on a search for the legendary fountain of youth. But theyd better move quickly a British team led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) plans to get there first. Angelica assembles a crew by posing as her former beau--a certain Jack Sparrow. The real Sparrow (Depp) is characteristically bemused by this impersonation until he figures out how to turn it to his advantage. Soon hes hopped aboard Blackbeards ship determined to beat everyone else to immortality. Cruz makes a fine foil for Depp; her spirited presence brings a much-needed second (fourth?) wind to these familiar proceedings. But she cant carry a movie alone and everyone else--Depp included--seems to be nearly tapped out. Theres one great scene in which the sailors meet some unexpectedly dangerous mermaids but it only  highlights whats missing most of the time. Meanwhile even those inclined to be generous may suspect theyre being duped when they put on their plastic glasses. Making a frustratingly dark movie even muddier the 3D and Imax options enhance nothing but the price of a ticket. There was a time when Captain Jack was as wonderfully unpredictable as Depps other iconic characters. But despite Sparrows ongoing flashes of charm Depp himself seems to know hes coasting. No matter how much treasure this excursion turns up hes clearly more inspired by uncharted territory. Dont Miss Keep your eyes open for a surprising cameo at the start--youll never guess who Sparrow seduces during his first escape.

(AP Photo/Disney Peter Mountain) Beware matey -- the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series has been taken over by zombies. Without Gore Verbinski at the helm the fourth movie in the lucrative franchise is a long slow voyage through shallow water.""On Stranger Tides"" was directed by Rob Marshall who paced ""Chicago"" to the snappy rhythms of a jazz soundtrack. But without a ration of razzle-dazzle this unfunny flick has the pace of a landlubber walking the plank. Even Johnny Depp whose loopy portrayal of Capt. Jack Sparrow kept the first three movies afloat when they were overloaded with special effects seems to be going through the motions.The skeletal plot is that three ships are racing to find the Fountain of Youth. The Spaniards have the inside track until the king of England commissions a ship under the command of crooked Capt. Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush). Sparrow then joins a rival expedition organized by his lost love Angelica (Penelope Cruz). Angelica is the fiery daughter of the sinister pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane a good fit for the franchise) who seeks the elixir of immortality to thwart his prophesied death at the hands of Barbosa. To work the waters of the fountain must be mixed with the tears of a mermaid in a golden chalice. So the story is more of a scavenger hunt than a rekindled romance between Jack and Angelica.The closest thing to an impressive visual in this dreary downsized 3-D flick is when some flirty mermaids are lured to a lighthouse where captors await. Blackbeard nets one of the mermaids (Astrid Berges-Fribey) and tries to make her cry but shes protected by the obligatory chivalrous hunk (Sam Claflin). ""On Stranger Tides"" has the fishy smell of something washed ashore and sold as new. But this shipwreck isnt worth a wooden doubloon.

"Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides Rob Marshalls wan direction and too much Johnny Depp (too much) sink this 4th pirate ship. - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Yo-ho-humMassive amounts of Mr. D even in 3-D cant save this excursionMay 19 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticPenelope Cruz Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush in ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides.""Shot in 3-D if that means anything to anybody anymore ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" comes with a misleading subtitle. Stranger tides? Stranger than what? Whats strange or fresh about any of the mechanical diversions on offer here?Director Rob Marshalls chorus of yo-ho-hum does remind us that Johnny Depp really was a good time in the first and second ""Pirates"" movies. The new film reminds us also that in general projects undertaken by Jerry Bruckheimer are better with hotfoots such as Depp or Nicolas Cage or the next Depp or Cage on screen messing around subverting expectations.But ""Pirates 4"" reminds us of this without being any fun on its own. Marshall directs the seafaring traffic taking over the hugely successful franchise from Gore Verbinski. Say what you will about the combined 127-hour running time of the first three but Verbinski particularly on the second picture managed some creative and engaging set pieces (the giant hamster-wheel bit for one). Dutifully by contrast Marshall must learn on the job with plenty of tech support but not much on the page.The legendary fountain of youth serves as the treasured booty this time and its eternal riches are being pursued by an ever-morphing scrum of double-crossing weasels. They include Capt. Jack Sparrow essayed sashayed and flounced by Depp with occasional traces of the old panache; Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) representing the British navy; the Spanish fleet whose very ships appear to snivel along with their sniveling crew; a rogue Spanish pirate (Penelope Cruz dressed up and ready to play but stuck with a wanly conceived Puss in Boots ""Bickersons"" routine); and the ruthless Blackbeard (Ian McShane who speaks as if being paid by the pause).En route to the magical fountain over on Soundstage 19 the ""Pirates 4"" gang runs into demon cannibal mermaids among other things. I will astonish you with this fact The film also contains many sword fights frenzied in the extreme. Marshall shows little facility for mapping out and choreographing action in a satisfying way. Depp isnt slumming but even in a product such as this the quality of the script matters. Also the proportions are off People tend to forget that Depp wasnt all over every scene in the first ""Pirates."" The wastrel Sparrow ends up both overexploited and underpowered in this fourth outing.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of action/adventure violence some frightening images sensuality and innuendo)Cast Johnny Depp (Capt.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Because ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides was made with a chest of Disney doubloons and the might of producer Jerry Bruckheimer it features the finest 3-D money can buy. None of this cut-rate post-production conversion junk; the extra-dimensionality of the latest ""Pirates feels thought out and even finely crafted as if you were really in that summer-movie snow globe for the ride.Of course just to make sure we get our inflated ticket prices worth the movie spends much of the 137-minute running time throwing stuff at our heads. I kept a list if only to pass the time a wagonful of flaming coals rolling barrels spurting water spurting wine many swords a voodoo doll in the shape of Johnny Depp a human being in the shape of Johnny Depp. Everything but the script. In fairness that might have passed by unnoticed.To press the point there is absolutely no need for a fourth ""Pirates of the Caribbean but here it is anyway four years after the third film supposedly brought things to a close. It promises to be the start of a new trilogy too but one wonders how long a franchise this massive can run on iron-poor blood. ""On Stranger Tides gets the job done but just barely and without that extra dimension and an unforgettably spooky few scenes in the middle it would be a paltry thing indeed.Theres a new director at the helm. Rob Marshall (""Chicago) at least streamlines the story line so that its easier to follow than the hectic delirium of Gore Verbinskis originals but hes working with only half the marbles. Missing from the new installment are Orlando Blooms dreamy Will Turner Jack Davenports doughty Norrington Tom Hollanders villainous Beckett comic beanpole Mackenzie Crook and most crucially Keira Knightleys Elizabeth Swann who by 2007s ""At Worlds End had assumed the mantle of the series central character.But not its star. That would be Depps Captain Jack Sparrow the projects antic Puck. When the original ""Pirates appeared eight years ago the shock was that an actor this serious could play it so lightly swinging like a drunken cavalier from mast to rooftop to desert isle.Because Jack wasnt the movies main character Depp was free to be the swash in its buckle mocking the stodgy unironic bigness of the blockbuster in which he found himself. No wonder the Disney executives got ulcers as they watched the first films rushes.Well Jacks the main event now and while Depp gets his laughs the act is starting to pall. Hes like a party guest who has told the same joke too many times now; its a good joke but you know the teller can do better. ""On Stranger Tides sends Jack in search of the fabled Fountain of Youth tacking between his old foe Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) whos now working as a privateer for King George (a wonderfully hammy Richard Griffiths) and the dread pirate Edward Teach a.k.a. Blackbeard (Ian McShane) who has a zombie crew and a fetching pirate daughter named Angelica (Penelope Cruz). The underwritten script contorts itself to give Jack and Angelica a past romance but while the two actors play pleasantly together they never once strike a genuine spark.That in fact is the primary problem with ""On Stranger Tides Its a machine with no heart. At least until the midpoint when Blackbeards ship pulls up in Whitecap Bay and sets a few crewmembers out as bait for the mermaids. (You need a mermaids tear to put in one of the chalices for the Fountain of Youth ritual and -- oh never mind.)Eerily visualized and even better thrillingly original this sequence carries a sensuous underwater dread as the mermaids surface lovely young sirens with malicious intent. Its like a shark attack with extra added hormones.Out of this sexual horror rises a romance between a virginal captured mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) and a young cleric (Sam Claflin) whos aboard Barbossas ship only because the movie needs a straight man who looks great with his shirt off.""On Stranger Tides keeps cranking up the four-way contest of wills between Barbossa Blackbeard Jack and Angelica with the Spanish Armada tossed in as a palate cleanser but you keep urging it back toward the scenes between the man of God and the lady of Fish if only because their scenes are the only ones with any emotional content whatsoever.Other characters rise to the surface like flotsam Keith Richards in a nonsensical return appearance as Jacks piratical dad Judi Dench as a dowager whose carriage Jack briefly crashes.Individual scenes of swordplay and rope-swinging have the necessary vigor but the whole feels terribly forced as if its marking time for . . . what? 3-D technology to improve to the point where its worth the extra four dollars? Depp to find his groove again? I never thought Id miss the overstuffed craziness of Verbinskis originals -- the squiddly extras the moments of sheer pop surrealism the Kraken -- but ""On Stranger Tides is like a familiar house where half the furniture has been sold off.

Thats a fitting premise for a blockbuster franchise that now risks treading on thin ice by trotting out its fourth chapter. After all isnt it the dream of every big-budget sequel to seem as fresh and new as the one before it? And to ensure that the franchise itself stays eternally youthful? A sequel like On Stranger Tides however feels like an antiaging tonic thats being forced on the audience. Early on a platoon of British redcoats plucks Johnny Depps Jack Sparrow from a coach and deposits him in an ornate sitting room where they bind him to a gold-leaf chair. While waiting to be interrogated (about what hes not certain) Captain Jack jumps forward a few inches at a time and tries to grab the cream puff thats sitting on the table. Thats a vintage Jack Sparrow moment His life hangs in the balance and all he cares about is the sweet pastry in front of him. Jack the dreadlocked rummy pirate who never says exactly what he means is a bit of a decadent dessert item himself -- a tasty overstuffed confection sugary on the inside. But consume too much of him and it isnt good for your arteries. When Jack trapped in that royal chamber comes up against King George II (Richard Griffiths) a rotter with the face of a gigantic pink baby the two are so flamboyant that the scene carries a charge. Then Jack escapes leaping through the room like a ? demented Musketeer and the coach chase that follows is just as brisk. Thats about where the fun ends though. In the past I would have said -- I have said quite often -- that I wish that the Pirates of the Caribbean movies would cut down on the ghoulishly hyperkinetic CGI and nonsensical plotting. Well be careful what you wish for. On Stranger Tides has little in the way of jousting skeletons acid-trip desert dream sequences or over-the-top plot twists. And frankly I dont think Ive ever longed more for excessive CGI and nonsense. Basically the entire film consists of Jack traveling aboard the run-down death ship of the ? sinister pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane) all to reach the island that houses the legendary fountain. Meanwhile the peg-legged Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) working for King George heads for the same destination. Directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago Nine) who has taken over from Gore Verbinski On Stranger Tides is so straightforward yet plodding that it puts the old back in old-fashioned entertainment. Watching this lead balloon of a tall tale in which you can see around every corner I actually began to wish that say Russell Brand had been handed the role of Jack Sparrow or had at least played his even less sane brother. Jack more than ever is now front and center the focal point of every scene and the result is that hes become less of a jester and more of a colorless expository hero. He ticks off the story for us point by point instead of standing to the side lobbing little verbal bombs at it. Depps delivery is still amusingly sozzled but the performance has lost any trace of surprise or merry deranged zing. The more Jack says the less funny he is. On Blackbeards ship theres a mutiny which doesnt lead anywhere of note and after a while theres a mermaid captured because her tears are needed to activate the fountains magic. Shes played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey with all the intrigue of a model in a French perfume commercial. There is also a great deal of turgid scene-chewing devoted to the issue of whether Angelica (Penelope Cruz) Jacks ""feisty"" new love interest is actually Blackbeards daughter. Cruz rather than enticing is testy and one-note and Jack doesnt seem all that sparked by her. McShane at least performs with his usual homicidal gleam -- he fires up every scene that hes in -- but the overly strenuous romantic backchat keeps stopping the movie dead. Everyone gets to the lush green island and then?very little. More traveling around and talking about nothing. Will Jack at knife- and gunpoint take a flying leap off a humongous cliff? Will the Fountain of Youth actually work? As a filmmaker Marshall has a singular knack for stripping questions like these of even their most basic propulsive interest. On Stranger Tides isnt nearly strange enough. Its one real act of piracy is stealing away your excitement.

Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides Bad Director Rob Marshall. Cast Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz Ian McShane. Rating PG-13 for action/adventure violence. This weeks new movie releases Depp held Pirates rehearsals in his former bar Keith Richards talks Pirates book Rolling Stones Spotlight Johnny Depp Spotlight Penelope Cruz Adventure movies But once you find it isnt all you have to do take a drink? Not so in ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides."" Finding the fountain proves difficult enough but harnessing its powers once youre there is complicated. Very complicated. Insanely complicated with so many disparate elements thrown together that eventually it makes no sense and you wonder why you bothered to make the trip in the first place. Wait were still talking about the Fountain of Youth here right? Eh or the movie. Works either way. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are gone in the fourth installment of the blockbuster franchise but Johnny Depp returns as Capt. Jack Sparrow the Keith Richards-inspired pirate. A good thing - although obviously not as original as the first time around (or the second or third) Depps performance is still one of the few bright spots in the movie. Richards is back too in an all-too-brief appearance as Sparrows father. Director Rob Marshall takes over for Gore Verbinski. He knows his way around an action scene but too often drags the proceedings to a halt so that characters can tell a story or explain things. And how any director could make Ian McShane as Blackbeard increasingly less scary as the movie goes on is anyones guess but Marshall manages to do so. The film finds Sparrow in London where the king wants him to help beat Spain to the Fountain of Youth. Bemused to see old foe Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) now in the Royal Navy Sparrow declines the offer and instead plots an elaborate escape that involves swinging from a chandelier a wagon filled with flaming coal and a cameo by Dame Judi Dench of all things. But he soon crosses paths with Angelica (Penelope Cruz) a former flame whom he um met in a convent leading her on the swashbuckling path. They fight they flirt theyre the Honeymooners with swords. They also wind up on the Queen Annes Revenge the pirate ship of the dread Blackbeard who also - wouldnt you know it - seeks the Fountain of Youth. If youre counting thats the Spanish the British and Blackbeard and his crew of zombies and prisoners competing in the race for eternal life. Its like an Olympic sport gone to seed. But just finding the fountain isnt enough. Several artifacts must first be found including - because why not - the tear of a mermaid. But these are not Darryl-Hannah-in-""Splash"" mermaids. These are vampire mermaids which sounds like a Halloween costume a 4-year-old might make out of leftover bits and pieces found in a closet. Plays that way in the movie as well. A romance between Philip (Sam Claflin) a religious fellow Blackbeard has captured and one of the mermaids (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) is nothing more than a distraction. Thats fitting. The movie is a series of distractions tossed together in the hopes that they will come together in a coherent story. That never really happens. Also Ive never really picked sides in the great 3-D debate but this is a good argument against the fad. Everything is murky so much so that in some of the darker scenes its hard to tell whats going on. Although thats true in some of the brightly lit scenes as well. Clocking in at two hours and 17 minutes ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" is actually the shortest of the four films but you feel every second. For the infinitely patient there is a bonus scene after the interminable credits roll but its not much of a payoff. And thats asking an awful lot. Havent we seen enough already?

The pirates of the Caribbean are back and this time theyve given up on the doubloons and galleons to plunder something really precious. Our time. The series always tended toward the epic; this film is actually the shortest. But the other films were faster and fresher. The pacing is off now and much of what were shown weve seen before. If you dont remember much of the series -- and the last two were sort of a bouillabaisse of sea monsters Chow Yun-Fat and pirates with faces like a plate of calamari -- no matter. The filmmakers dont much care what happened anyway. All you need to know is that the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow has lost his ship the Black Pearl. And is so rashly eager to get it back he lets himself get tricked by the infamous Blackbeard who has his own quest -- to find the Fountain of Youth. There are a few holdovers from the earlier films -- not Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley alas but Geoffrey Rush as Sparrows chief piratical nemesis. Theres also an added attraction in Penelope Cruz playing an old love of Sparrows (and a new competitor). Movie Review Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides (PG-13) Disney (137 min.) Directed by Rob Marshall. With Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz. Opening Friday in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence and grog abuse. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS And did I mention this is now in 3-D with swords and bodices coming straight at the camera? Thats a plus I suppose except that theres a new director too in Rob Marshall a consistently employed big-budget filmmaker who consistently misses the point (the uncynical ""Chicago"" the unmoving ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" the unfocused ""Nine""). His approach to this project is just as clumsy. The film begins in a hodgepodge of action a chase scene turning into a battle turning into another pursuit turning into another fight. It doesnt realize we need time to catch our breath and space to appreciate the swordplay (something at least the director of the first three films Gore Verbinski occasionally understood). And then after about half an hour of this the film goes to sea -- and drifts. Depp and Cruz join up with Blackbeard Rush chases after them and the Spanish navy goes in pursuit of everyone. Nothing is clear except the fact that weve seen this before. Theres an interminable trek through the same Hawaiian rain forest thats in every other modern jungle movie; even a swordfight in a magical cave feels like something done earlier and better in the first film. Theres one good spooky sequence with a school of mermaids and the cast hams it up amusingly. Cruz flashes her eyes Rush smacks his lips and Depp minces about slurring his words and batting his lashes. But without Blooms baby swashbuckler Depps bizarre pirate has been elevated to sole lead -- a responsibility the character cant sustain. And without a strong hero or simple conflict its all just a lot of ""Avast"" and ""Ahoy"" and ""Arrrrrrr."" The film deliberately provides a clearcut fate for only one of the characters leaving the rest to return for however many more sequels the filmmakers can turn out. And perhaps thats the real curse of the Black Pearl. No matter how many times it sinks to the bottom its always there waiting to be salvaged for one last leaky voyage.

After sinking into self-important tedium with its prior two overstuffed installments Pirates of the Caribbean seemed destined for permanent burial at sea. And yet the soggy franchise and Johnny Depps foppish rapscallion return again for On Stranger Tides--to search for the fountain of youth no less a quest that Chicago director Rob Marshall (taking the helm from Gore Verbinski) embellishes with the usual gaggle of musty ships-and-sabers tropes and cacophonous CGI. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Captain Jack Sparrows limb-flailing shenanigans had already become old-hat during his past outings so Depps routine--the look-at-me flamboyance of his trinket-decorated braided hair flowing scarves and giant rings as well as his half-drunken flouncing lisping and pratfalling--is no longer a surprise but rather a dreary expectation fulfilled. More astonishing however is that even though it does away with its preceding trilogys plot-heavy mythology for a supposedly more streamlined stand-alone story the ensuing tale--in which Jack reluctantly teams with his former flame Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and her iconic baddie daddy Blackbeard (Ian McShane) to reach the legendary fountain before English king-employed Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)--is a familiar mess of rules rituals creatures and chandelier-swinging sword-clashing pandemonium.No knowledge of the first three Pirates films is required for this fourth go-around a merciful development given how severely forgettable the previous convoluted machinations were. More merciful still is that Dull (Keira Knightley) and Duller (Orlando Bloom) have also been jettisoned their milquetoast fashion-model-pretty amour here replaced by Jacks spirited love/hate passions for Angelica a Feisty Spanish Sexpot whose heart the pirate broke years earlier. The couples initial reunion involves Angelica posing as Jack thereby positing her as his equal as well as re-establishing Jacks trademark self-love a trait Ted Elliott and Terry Rossios screenplay attempts to complicate by having the gold-toothed scoundrel eventually confess to having actual ""feelings"" for Angelica.Regardless On Stranger Tides merely feigns at delivering a more mushy-hearted Jack all while establishing a narrative goal for its hero and then erecting constant intricate impediments designed to maintain a mood of head-spinning business. Instead of fleshing out Jacks personal hunger for ceaseless longevity we get rescues from prison foolhardy mutinies redemption-preaching missionaries and carnivorous mermaids. The plot feels strained in both its tense romantic repartee and in its rollicking centerpieces as Marshall shoots Jack and Angelicas maiden duel with invigorating clarity and rhythm before succumbing to his typical edited-to-ribbons incoherence.As befitting a saga about neer-do-wells engaged in supernatural adventure On Stranger Tides depicts pious zealots as killjoys but its Jack who turns out to be the real downer. Although Depp seems to have rediscovered a bit of the original spark that was MIA in Dead Mans Chest and At Worlds End and the script provides plentiful opportunities for him to devour scenery his Jack remains a once-inspired creation now far less funny than he fancies himself and consequently Marshalls film often plays like a series of setups for Sparrow-centric payoffs that never materialize. Still at least Depp is given something to do; McShane on the other hand is relegated to exuding evil mainly via his long scraggly beard and Rush is stuck for the first two-thirds at a remove from the action proper blaring ""Yar"" and ""Aye aye"" as he pursues Jack on a ship full of British stiffs.As the seductive and conniving Angelica Cruz is luminous albeit not enough to compensate for Marshall shrouding virtually every major set piece in nighttime fogginess. Further sabotaged by light-dimming 3-D the visual murkiness comes off as a blatant attempt to mask the shoddiness of the special effects and the unoriginality of the combat choreography and ultimately proves directly at odds with a story driven by its characters desire to escape deaths everlasting darkness. Jack will no doubt live to prance another day but from Depps fey bon mots to a cameoing Keith Richardss scraggly visage his swashbuckling series is showing its age.1 Johnny Depp dresses up for money.Peter Mountain Disney Enterprises Inc.

But the experience of sitting through this latest flogged cash cow in the already overexposed comedy adventure series feels more like tracking stock figures than watching a piece of family entertainment. Every frame feels laboured every gag tired every action set piece familiar every performance phoned in.Johnny Depp is back in the headscarf and eyeliner as Captain Jack Sparrow whose search for the Fountain of Youth has foundered for no specific reason. Finding himself in London for no specific reason he soon falls in with ex-lover Angelica (Penelope Cruz) who is masquerading as Sparrow for no specific reason. Together they set off for the fountain pursued by Geoffrey Rushs peg-legged Barbossa who has joined the British navy for no specific reason. On Stranger Tides is a film which seems so loaded with contempt for its audience that it expects us not to notice or care that the characters have no clear motivation that entire scenes have no reason for existing and that for much of the film we dont even know what continent were on. Its a film where our heroes can escape a trap by simply pulling a lever and dropping through the floor where a character can dive into a hole in the ground and pop up in an entirely different part of the story. A film in other words without tension momentum or resonance. For some this may be a step up from the wilful psychedelic idiocy of At Worlds End the previous film in the series. But at least that had imagination On Stranger Tides is simply lifeless a reductive insulting moneymaking exercise with as much charm and depth as a slot machine.

The CGI in the last two spoiled them and theres not so much of it here (or maybe theyve just perfected it). But I saw the 2D version and noticed that there were a lot of aerial shots flying over forests and precipices and I thought theyd added them in for the 3D showings. Im sort of fed up of 3D and it annoyed me that live action films (that dont actually work very well in 3D) are being made with 3D scenes built in. All that happens in 3D live action movies is they look a bit dull because the glasses are dark. Ive only seen maybe three really good live action 3D movies - Superman Returns and a couple of Harry Potters which I saw on an IMAX screen. You really felt you could reach out and touch the characters.

No. So this is the first one of the 4 ive seen in the cinema (or all the way through) therefore I may be a little more tollerant than those who arent fans but who have seen the other 3. ON THIS BASIS alone I found it to be reasonably entertaining (though far too dark) and lacking in too many ""get on with it ffs"" moments. But Id had enough of this romp by the time the credits rolled and wont be seeking out the others...all very remenisant of my first ever viewing of the ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise a few weeks ago.

When financial necessity transformed Disneys breezy ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" into a ponderous waterlogged trilogy the franchise reached such a saturation point that even star Johnny Depp admitted he often had no clue what was going on in his own scenes. For that ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" serves as a welcome corrective reviving the fun feather-light frivolity that any film based on a Disneyland ride ought to exhibit. It has nary an original idea and still doesnt make much sense but its lost all pretensions that it should and looks poised to plunder massive worldwide coin. Making a conscious break from Gore Verbinskis trilogy -- and dropping two key protagonists without explanation -- new director Rob Marshall discards much of the convoluted mythology of the later pics and instead adapts an unrelated novel (Tim Powers ""On Stranger Tides"") to fit the characters. Thats hardly the only looting going on however. This film contains heavy lifting from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" a moony supernatural romance cribbed straight from Stephenie Meyer and even a Lone Ranger and Tonto-style walk into the sunset. Some of this falls flat but Marshall gets away with it on the sheer earnestness of his appropriations -- had he attempted to disguise them it would have felt dishonest; had he winked at them the film would have disintegrated into a smirking exercise. As it is it almost brings to mind Umberto Ecos famous description of ""Casablanca"" as a hundred different cliches celebrating a reunion. Following an appropriately pulpy prologue the film opens on erstwhile Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) as hes marooned in London in search of a ship and pursued by local authorities who he makes little serious effort to avoid. Hearing that an impostor Sparrow is auditioning pirate recruits at a seaside bar he seeks out the interloper only to discover his spitfire former lover Angelica (Penelope Cruz) disguised as him. After some requisite sword-clashing Angelica kidnaps Sparrow and ferries him aboard the Queen Annes Revenge lorded over by Angelicas (maybe) father Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Commanding a crew comprised of equal parts stray pirates and hulking zombies -- why he needs the former when he has the latter is never explained -- Blackbeard enlists Sparrow to help him locate the fountain of youth which becomes an especially urgent task after a prophecy foretells Blackbeards imminent death at the hands of a one-legged man. Meanwhile Sparrows rival Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) now conveniently one-legged has bid farewell to his pirates life and seeks the fountain on behalf of the king of England who is keen to find it before a rival crew sent by the king of Spain can claim it for themselves. As the three parties converge on the fountains jungle location they must also deal with a ravenous horde of vampiric mermaids from whom a single tear must be procured to drink the fountains waters. (Somewhat disturbingly these sirens are the perpetrators and victims of the only borderline-upsetting violence in the film.) In case auds have trouble following any of the above frequent recaps are provided throughout and it ultimately doesnt matter too much anyway. More problematic is the films near-total lack of suspense. Now that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightleys land-lubber audience surrogates have been cast off the viewer is left entirely in the company of unflappable pirates who rarely seem overly concerned with how they will wiggle out of any particular jam. All the better to enjoy the impressive choreography of the action setpieces maybe but it robs the pic of any real tension. Depp remains the face of the film and has lost little enthusiasm for his mincing derring-do. But a majority of his thunder is co-opted by an on-point Rush who not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depps stock and trade. McShane on the other hand is underwhelming. Never appearing comfortable in his heavy pirate get-up his tired Blackbeard is only menacing via other characters testimonials to his evil and his one onscreen atrocity seems tossed in merely to stress that he is in fact the bad guy. Cruz is a reliably welcome gorgeous presence though she too often falls back on the ""feisty Latina"" signifiers that have been the crutch of so much of her English-language work. Sam Claflin supplies some semi-risible gallantry as a super-studly priest and Astrid Berges-Frisbey looks effectively terrified as a captive mermaid. Aside from some groan-worthy swords and serpents protruding from the screen 3D lensing is smart and clear and Hans Zimmers bombastic score is never inappropriate to the goings-on onscreen. Production design and visual effects all look very expensive.

TWITTER Johnny Depp searches for the fountain of youth and Keith Richards delivers a soon-to-be-classic line in director Rob Marshalls lively 3D ""Pirates."" LONDON - Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is back in excellent form for his fourth adventure in Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides which is more serious in the hands of a new director Rob Marshall and thanks to Penelope Cruz its also a good deal sexier. Best known for musicals such as Nine and the Academy Award-winning Chicago Marshall shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights and he handles the 3D well. He also adds a dash of pepper with lively sexual tension between Sparrow and a Spanish firecracker named Angelica (Cruz). Angelica is Jacks match for swordplay and sexy banter and while the tone of the film which deals with a search for the fountain of youth is darker than the three directed by Gore Verbinski its action adventure and comedy will see it find a similar pot of theatrical gold. More of the story takes place on dry land than the other films with inventive and exciting set pieces in London and the hills and jungles of an exotic place where lies the secret of perpetual youth. It begins with Jack in the British capital to find a way to release from prison his stalwart sailmate Gibbs (Kevin McNally). With inspiration from a novel by Tim Powers titled On Stranger Tides about another captain named Jack screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio show typical ingenuity in devising hair-raising obstacles for Jack to overcome. In the opening this involves changing the course of justice in an English court an encounter with the king in his palace and a riotous chase through the streets of London. The series regular cinematographer Dariusz Wolski captures the cityscapes wittily and makes the most of real locations from the city center to the venerable naval museum at Greenwich. Marshall has brought in his usual production designer John Myhre who won an Oscar for Chicago and he makes the palaces pubs and later jungle temple breathtakingly shipshape. Hans Zimmer demonstrates again his keen grasp of how a musical score can inform action and elevate mood and tension. The plot is again driven by a search for something virtually unobtainable as Jack finds himself in a chase to find the fountain of youth in competition with not only the returning Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush having fun once more) but also the Spanish navy and the most deadly pirate of them all Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Cruz makes a splendid entrance in disguise but once revealed she brings her Oscar-winning vivacity to an irrepressible woman who claims to be Blackbeards daughter. McShane too grabs his first appearance on the bridge of a pirate ship with great panache. No less would be expected of Rolling Stone Keith Richards who has a killer line as Jacks indomitable pirate father when his son asks him whether hes ever seen the fountain of youth. It feeds cleverly on the Richards legend and will become one of the most-quoted lines from the series. The film makes an adventurous departure from the traditionally benign view about mermaids. A mermaids tear is a vital ingredient of the potion required for the secret of youth and so Blackbeard schemes to ensnare a school of them in nets on an island beach. They turn out to have more in common with one of Davy Jones underwater beasts save one played by sweet-looking Astrid Berges-Frisbey who falls for an idealistic cleric played by Sam Claflin. The missionary gives Jack fodder for an amusing line but also puts religious faith in a good light compared to the Spanish Catholics whose inquisitional devotion makes them the bad guys. Marshall and his team make good use of 3D in the exterior sequences so that London landmarks and rocky islands look magnificent. It is less successful when CGI is involved however as characters sometimes appear to be cut out figures. At 136 minutes the film is marginally the shortest in the series and it profits from that. Cruz is a wonderful addition and a teaser following the credits augers well for more so long as Depp continues to get as much enjoyment from playing the role as he gives to his audience.
