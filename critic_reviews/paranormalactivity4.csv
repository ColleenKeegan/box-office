Watching Paranormal Activity 4 I found myself wishing that there was a way to monetize the concept of a 45-minute-long feature. (Technically speaking a feature film need only be more than 40 minutes long but when was the last time you saw something that short in a theater?) The fourth film in the extremely profitable Paranormal Activity franchise works largely along the same lines as the earlier ones An admirably tense buildup effectively utilizes the films found-footage gimmick before a lot of dithering around waiting for predictable repetitive scares reveals the concepts limitations. The film follows up on the occurrences in PA2 in which a girl named Katie abducted her baby nephew Hunter from his father and mother (her sister) after killing them. Now were in the happy suburban Nevada home of Alice (Kathryn Newton) and her 6-year-old brother Wyatt. Their life starts to take a creepy turn when Robbie a shy odd boy from across the street comes to stay with them after his (unseen) mother mysteriously has to go to the hospital. Could this boy be Hunter? Well he certainly seems weird. Soon enough Alice and her boyfriend Ben who were already into Skyping are rigging up computers and their cameras around the house to monitor the strange things little Robbie does at night. These early scenes work reasonably well in part because the characters have an easygoing unscripted feel to them; they feel like real suburban kids. The film was directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Shulman who also made PA3 and who came to prominence with the offbeat indie documentary hit Catfish (which had enough of a thriller/mystery vibe that some felt it was staged). They gleefully get plenty of horror mileage out of the sound of random objects and/or wind hitting the microphone and they also display a fondness for the unmotivated jump cut as a source of cheap scares. As usual there are lots of open doors and barely visible corridors in the background. And yes this family does own a cat. But after a while we start to get bored at seeing the same locations (the same bedrooms the same living room the same kitchen) used in the same ways (a creeping shadow here a thud on the ceiling there). This happens around the point where other horror films would start to get busy explaining the plot  letting their characters discover what kind of demon is following them and/or ways to defeat it. To their credit the Paranormal Activity films tend to keep this type of expository drivel to a minimum (though theres the usual brief bit of business here about some ancient Hittite demon) but it also means that the stories such as they are dont have anywhere to go after a certain point. But the real problem behind Paranormal Activity 4 is that its entire raison detre has gotten old; producer Oren Peli who directed the first one even included some gentle digs at the found-footage genre in his superior Chernobyl Diaries released earlier this year. This time around the reasoning behind the gimmick gets tossed after a certain point but the gimmick itself remains Were still seeing things through handheld devices and built-in laptop cameras even though nobody seems interested in looking at the footage the cameras were supposedly recording. (This wouldnt be so distracting if the characters hadnt spent the first 40 or so minutes of the film incessantly looking at said footage.) In other words were basically just waiting to get to the end. Because we know that despite all the profound gaps in logic and the regurgitated thrills the PA films have a tendency to rally in their final moments. Sure enough this one picks up as it reaches its climax finally delivering the kind of in-your-face fuck-you ending these films have now become known for. Anyway Im going to hope against hope that Paranormal Activity 5 clocks in at under an hour. Then we might have something. -- Bilge Ebiri Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick The Larry Sanders Show Is Coming to HBO Streaming Outlets in September Avengers Infinity War Doesnt Want Infinite Films Is Now Just a Standalone Film Somebody Alert the Television Academy A New Alan Ball Family Drama Is Coming to HBO TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

"Paranormal Activity 4 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; paranormal-activity-4 ) Paranormal Activity 4 (United States 2012) October 19 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli They could have called this Paranormal Inactivity. Its a rare horror franchise indeed that manages to remain fresh and creepy by the time it arrives at installment 4. Paranormal Activity despite a terrific beginning quickly grew stale and repetitive and the third sequel is easily the most lifeless. Its as if all the first movies assets have been turned into liabilities and all the energy has been leeched away. Part of the problem is that theres really nowhere for the series to go but finances have demanded that the filmmakers churn out a new episode every Halloween. Another issue is the way directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman present their footage (still first-person). Instead of using anticipation to build dread they approach things in a more straightforward matter-of-factly fashion. Payoffs are few and far between. The woman not paying attention as she dices vegetables does not lose a digit. The vanishing knife does not reappear in someones back. There are far too many missed opportunities. The ""boo"" moments lack punch. Theyre uniformly obligatory and not in the least bit shocking. In fact especially toward the end they verge on self-parody. Paranormal Activity 4 follows the same basic formula first-person footage tells the story of a family who finds their home life increasingly disturbed by potentially malevolent supernatural activity. In this case the 15-year old heroine Alex (Kathryn Newton) has a webcam set up on open (Apple) laptops in almost every room of the house which limits (but does not eliminate) the amount of inappropriate time she has to spend running around carrying her computer. She has a boyfriend younger brother mother and father. All of them are about as well-developed as one might expect. The real problem is the creepy across-the-street neighbors a familiar figure from the Paranormal Activity saga Katie (Katie Featherstone) who arrives with an adopted six-year old in tow. For about 30 minutes nothing happens. Its a little like watching home movies or PG web chats (because Kathryn Newton is the same age as her character theres no question of any naughty stuff). Over the next 45 minutes a few things go bump in the night but theres a lot of dead space in which nothing much happens. Lots of shots of empty rooms. Of course we stare hard at those empty rooms expecting there to be something creepy or scary... unfortunately theyre just empty rooms. Then every once in a while someone strolls by. Doors mysteriously open while people are sleeping but they never wake up or watch the footage. Only in about the last 10 minutes do things happen and when they occur the ineptitude of the direction is so extreme that the action turns comedic. Exiting the theater I momentarily wondered if I had just witnessed a Paranormal Activity parody. But that would be giving far too many people too much credit for cleverness. This is just badly made formula schlock. I suppose it could be argued that Paranormal Activity 4 finally advances Katies story although not in a meaningful way. She hasnt been an important character since the first movie although she keeps popping up like a whack-a-mole. Installment 3 also directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman attempted to fill in some backstory via taking the prequel route (thereby delaying for a year the need to tell this story) but the whole thing doesnt hold together. The incremental ""revelations"" serve only to cheapen the original film. If theres one thing to compliment about Paranormal Activity 4 its the performance of Kathryn Newton who sells her role and the situation. The same cannot be said of the other actors who lack Newtons naturalness. She seems like a teenager whos caught in a very bad situation (in more ways than one); her fellow thespians are awkward and unconvincing. The acting quality is on par with what one gets in faux-amateur porn films. Paranormal Activity made the transition from low-budget horror phenomenon to bankable product with the release of the first sequel. Paramounts accountants are undoubtedly happy with the franchise but one wonders if the diluted level of scares offered by Paranormal Activity 4 will kill a series that has turned the concept of ""found footage"" from a legitimate stylistic choice to a groan-inducing mistake. Forget jumping the shark... this series has cleared a shark a whale and a submarine.

Credit Dean Hendler/Paramount Pictures The latest ""Paranormal Activity"" No. 4 is unlikely to attract new viewers to this horror series; by now youve signed on or not. But there are reasons these movies persist mainly a consistency and a determination not to overreach; understatement and adherence to form carry these films. ""Paranormal Activity 4"" will please the fans and that should sustain this low-budget highly profitable franchise.In a surprising -- and refreshing -- ""Paranormal"" first the focus in No. 4 is a teenager. Alex (Kathryn Newton wonderful) the heroine hangs out with her friend Ben (Matt Shively also delightful) or talks to him via Skype when shes not dealing with her bickering parents and young adopted brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp).Then theres the solemn brooding Robbie (Brady Allen) the boy next door adopted by Alexs family after his mother Katie (Katie Featherston the series mainstay) became sick. Ever since he moved in chandeliers and kitchen knives just havent been able to stay still. And somethings happening with the living room Xbox.Expect the customary surveillance cameras throughout a suburban home; jump cuts; bodies and faces pressed oppressively close to the lens; de rigueur dark hallways closet doors and distant noises. But the mood is often playful with teases and fake-outs that are sometimes humorous and usually right before shocks. Violence is rare quick and devoid of lingering close-ups.Can we expect a No. 5? Stick around after the closing credits.""Paranormal Activity 4"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Violence strong language and child endangerment.

Its October which means the low-budget high-yield ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise has plopped yet another sequel into theaters slavishly following the formula of previous chapters. Multiple surveillance cameras? Check. Spacious McMansion where strange things start happening? You got it. Bizarre apparitions that either move really slowly or very quickly through the frame? Yup. Viewers ready to shell out for ""Paranormal Activity 4"" can be assured that there are at least a half-dozen or so decent jolts to be enjoyed over the films running time but prepare for a long wait to actually get to them. The first two-thirds of the film redefines ""slow boil"" to the extent that audiences will spend as much time looking at their watch as they do waiting for something eerie to happen on screen. This installment begins with a flashback to ""Paranormal Activity 2"" which ended with creepy Katie (Katie Featherston) abducting her young nephew Hunter before jumping ahead to November 2011 when teen girl Alex (Kathryn Newton) and her boyfriend Ben (Matt Shively) start noticing theres something very weird about Robbie (Brady Allen) the dour bowl-haircutted boy across the street. When Robbies mom goes to the hospital late one night Alexs parents take Robbie in for the duration. His unusual behavior continues and weird shapes start showing up in Alex and Bens Skype conversations and then chandeliers start falling out of the ceiling. And so on. The biggest surprise that ""Paranormal Activity 4"" -- written by Christopher Landon (who did the previous two movies) and directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (the guys behind ""Catfish"" and ""PA3"") -- is that the relationship between Alex and Ben is so engaging. Theyre funny theyre flirty and theyre smart enough to realize that something weird is going on (its Ben who wires all the computers in the house to shoot surveillance footage) making them far more interesting than 95% of most other horror-movie teenagers. But praising a ""Paranormal Activity"" movie for the teen relationship is like lauding a restaurant for the music they play; its nice but its not what you came for. These movies tend to eschew the hard questions -- What is the agenda of Katies mysterious coven? Who exactly found the found footage of this movie? -- in favor of thrills and chills but even those dont build in any way. Yes its scary when the X-Box Kinect registers the presence of a person whos invisible to the naked eye or when a carving knife flies up to the ceiling when moms back is turned but ""Paranormal Activity 4"" provides this minimum requirement of scares without pacing them or escalating them in a way that builds tension or suspense. Would it be too much to ask that the franchise skip a year so that the inevitable ""Paranormal Activity 5"" script could actually take this story somewhere interesting while also spooking the bejesus out of us? Or would giving this cash cow a sabbatical cause too many nightmares in the bean-counters suite? Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The scariest stretch in Paranormal Activity 4 are the 10 seconds or so--though it feels like an agonizing minute--where a teenager abandons a web-chat conversation to investigate a weird noise and all the audience gets is an empty static shot of her bedroom wall and an open doorframe leading into her closet. That frame will be filled by something at some point whether its a specter or the girl returning to the conversation but in the meantime viewers are invited to scan around in the darkness and wonder about the terrible things that might be lurking in the shadows or off screen entirely. This is a familiar feeling in the Paranormal Activity movies which have by now become an annual reminder that the fundamentals of horror are strong. The mythology has deepened largely to the negative and the formula is as rigid as the fixins of a fast-food sandwich--tastes the same in every city. But the effects are eternally reliable. With an ominous title noting the mysterious disappearance of chief beastie Katie Featherston and her infant nephew from a California suburb the action shifts to Henderson Nevada and centers around Kathryn Newton a typical teenager with a sweet younger brother (Aiden Lovekamp) and a conveniently tech-savvy boyfriend (Matt Shively). Not long after discovering him hiding in their backyard treehouse at 10 o clock at night the creepy new kid from across the street played by Brady Allen comes to stay with them while his mother recovers from a vague illness. Between his blank stares his night prowling and his conversations with an imaginary friend Allen freaks Newton out even before things start going bump in the night. Using an Apple Stores worth of laptops around the house Newtons boyfriend sets up four different webcams to help figure out whats going on. Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman of Catfish fame directed the last Paranormal Activity movie which was the strongest mostly because of the inspired decision to mount a camera on the base of a rotating fan. Joost and Schulman try to exploit webcams to similar effect here and get some good scares out of the fact that web-chatters take up most of the screen obscuring whatever might be behind them. But Paranormal Activity 4 eventually falls back on the surveillance-cam concept and loses some of its grip as the action escalates and more of the occult silliness comes into play. (The ending too rips off The Blair Witch Project so egregiously they could have swapped some footage.) Still its a near-certainty that Paranormal Activity 5 will be terrifying--and based on where this series has gone its also a near-certainty it wont be surprising either.

Are you incapable of shooting a cell phone video much less managing the intricacies of a Web cam chat? Congratulations Your ineptitude guarantees that youll never be haunted by the vain ghosts and demons that stalk the video-savvy humans of the Paranormal Activity films. In the latest installment of this wildly profitable series Ben (Matt Shively) loyal boyfriend to the lovely Alex (Kathryn Newton) age 15 has mad A/V skills and he sets video cameras up in every room of his girls suburban Nevada home. Alex hopes the cameras will document her suspicion that the creepy little neighbor boy staying with her family has ""brought something with him"" into the house. As always we the audience witness much more of the footage than its subjects so poor Alex never sees herself for example floating above her own bed while sound asleep. Screenwriter Christopher Landon along with co-directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman make a truly lame attempt at establishing a supernatural mythology to explain all this but their real energies go to amping up the jarring sound cues darting shadows and last-shot shocker (so goofily weird this time that youll laugh out loud) that make this franchise a perennial crowd-pleaser.

Paranormal Activity 4 review Same old spooky stuff | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesParanormal Activity 4 review Same old spooky stuffThe quality isnt keeping pace with the frantic production quota as Paranormal Activity 4 makes as plain as the jump scares it overuses.Paranormal Activity 4 takes story strands from the first three movies and attempts to stitch them into something resembling a cohesive narrative.  (Dean Hendler / Paramount)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 19 2012Paranormal Activity 4 (out of 4)Starring Kathryn Newton Brady Allen and Katie Featherstone. Directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman. 88 minutes. Now playing at major theatres. 14AThings must be getting a tad frantic down at the McSpooky factory where they bang out Paranormal Activity sequels.Ever since Oren Peli first made bank in 2009 with his found-footage combo of grainy videos pesky demons and skittish homeowners the push has been on to have a new chapter of the slowly evolving saga out every Halloween.Article Continued BelowThe quality isnt keeping pace with the production quota as Paranormal Activity 4 makes as plain as the jump scares it overuses.Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman back for more after helming the superior PA3 take story strands from the first three movies and try to stitch them into something resembling a cohesive narrative. Its a stretch and also not all that scary.PA4 picks up the dangling plot line from PA2 where poltergeist-plagued Californian Katie (Katie Featherston) vanished in 2006 along with her baby nephew Hunter. This is hitched to strange 2011 goings-on in a Nevada household. The expository prequel that was PA3 is all but forgotten until the confusing ending of this film.You follow? It doesnt really matter because its all faint-by-numbers this time without even a cool device like the low-tech fan cam from PA3 to interest us or really scare us.The ghostly goings-on have shifted to Henderson Nev. an affluent suburb where never is heard a discouraging word -- until the day when weird neighbour kid Robbie (Brady Allen) comes to temporarily stay with a mother and father (Alexondra Lee and Stephen Dunham) their teen daughter Alex (Kathryn Newton a bright spark) and 6-year-old son Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp). Robbies mom unseen for now is in the hospital.Robbies obviously got issues but at least he believes in dental hygiene -- he brings his toothbrush along with a fork he claims is 100 years old. Robbie starts wandering the house at night painting demonic symbols on Wyatt and muttering about a spooky unseen pal.Thus ensues the usual PA drill of flying furniture ghostly levitations and dastardly doings both mischievous and menacing most of it dutifully caught on the laptops and pixelated Xbox that Alex and Robbie have constantly running (this is actually the most believable part of the story).Been there shrieked that but there are a couple of laughs. The dad actually switches a light on during one haunting spell and who ever does that in a horror movie? And Wyatt amusingly recalls The Shining as he tools around the house on his jumbo trike.Things start to get downright silly when PA4 shudders to an abrupt halt and then links back to events of PA3. Are we supposed to believe that zombiemeister George Romero is involved now too? Paranormal Activity is getting awfully crowded but theres no sign of this cash cower going away anytime soon quality be damned.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

There is still activity I regret to report and none of it is of the normal variety. When will these obsessive home-video enthusiasts learn? The first time an inanimate object hurls itself across the room at you is probably the time to pack a bag and bail. Dont stick around to get the really awesome YouTube footage. ""Toby"" this series resident demon only likes to go viral the old-fashioned way -- via possession. Returning to the present after the flashback to the 80s in ""Paranormal Activity 3"" the fourth installment in this found-footage horror series follows a family in Nevada playing host to a creepy 6-year-old neighbor boy (Brady Allen) whose unseen mother has suddenly been hospitalized. Robbie who doesnt have any other apparent relatives is prone to turning up in random places in the middle of the night standing and staring. This is as unnerving to Webcam-savvy teenage daughter Alex (Kathryn Newton gorgeous enough to withstand many an up-the-nose ""Blair Witch"" shot) and her sorta boyfriend Ben (Matt Shively) as it is fun for her little brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp) whos bunking with the weirdo. And its definitely of no concern to the parents (real-life couple Stephen Dunham and Alexondra Lee; Dunham tragically died last month of a heart attack) -- they are way too preoccupied with their passive-aggressive marriage to realize theyre being haunted. Any more details would spoil things but I think you know how this is going to play out The ""PA"" formula is tried and true. Long stretches of placid green night-cam footage manage to make your flesh creep as you try to figure out if you just saw movement in the corner. Then something eventually flies dramatically across the screen and no matter how much you tried to gird yourself you jump. Repeat repeat repeat. This is hardly reinventing the wheel but it is serviceable if youre looking for a few shivery communal scares. Filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman who also directed the last one even throw in a few nods to the classics as when Wyatt rides his Big Wheel around the house navigating a ghostly presence a la ""The Shining"" -- though pointing toward better and scarier fare doesnt really do them any favors. They also include Katie Featherston star of the previous films in some capacity though she mostly seems to serve as an odd cautionary tale Sure supernatural things that go bump in the night are chilling but what you really need to beware of is your crazy aunt.

BOTTOM LINE The motto of this enduring franchise is simple If it aint broke dont fix it. Set your bar low and you might have fun. CAST Katie Featherston Kathryn Newton Matt Shively LENGTH 128 The enduring horror franchise about haunted houses in suburban America returns with ""Paranormal Activity 4"" which means more creaking doors and bumps in the night. The shtick has been wearing thin but this time the filmmakers add something new a pretty blonde teenage heroine. About time To its credit ""Paranormal Activity 4"" almost never ogles young Alex played by the appealing newcomer Kathryn Newton but she and her almost-boyfriend Ben (a likeable Matt Shively) bring a youthful energy to this ossifying series. Theyre an endearing pair flirting and sharing confidences via Skype. When Alex gets up from her bed to inspect the latest thud downstairs a lovelorn Ben cries out from her laptop screen ""Wait take me with you"" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? In a story that will be familiar to fans of the previous films -- and to anyone whos seen any horror movie ever -- a little boy Robbie (Brady Allen) comes to stay with Alexs family and triggers a series of strange events. Robbie looks a bit like Danny from ""The Shining"" and even rides his tricycle around the house; he also forms an intense bond with Alexs little brother (Aiden Lovekamp). When Alex grows suspicious Ben reassuringly sets up computer cameras everywhere providing us with the found-footage experience these movies are known for. Returning directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman get some good scares using the motion-detecting beams of an Xbox Kinect but the script (by Christopher Landon and Chad Feehan) is the usual stuff the imaginary friend the weird symbol the possible cult next door. (Katie Featherston also returns providing a slim thread of continuity with the previous films.) The scares are hit-and-miss but at least Alex and Ben are fun to hang out with.

Paranormal Activity 4 will look pretty familiar to fans but the scares arent quite there (Dean Hendler) C- Paranormal Activity 4 Genre Horror; Starring Brady Allen Katie Featherston; Director Henry Joost Ariel Schulman; Release Date Wide 10/18/2012; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted October 20 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Suburban teen Alex (Kathryn Newton) gets increasingly freaked out as her little brother (Aiden Lovekamp) cozies up to his weirdo neighbor (Brady Allen) who says he has an invisible ""friend."" Its a new house with a new family in it but everything else in Paranormal Activity 4 will look pretty familiar to fans who come for the series signature trick of sneaking haunted-house scares into the background of ""surveillance"" footage. This time the recording is done with new gadgets like smartphones and the infrared camera of a Microsoft Kinect video game console but the goal is still the same scaring you witless with anticipation. And by that standard PA4 pales in comparison to the original trilogy. Writer-directors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost (Catfish PA3) have their heads too far in the franchises mythology which concerns a woman named Katie (Paranormal Activitys Katie Featherstone) who seems to be linked to a demonic spirit. PA4 develops the story ever so slightly (not enough to satisfy fans) and delivers a few good scares (not enough to satisfy newbies); mostly it plays like a overlong prologue for the already-in-the-works PA5. Heres hoping this is just the tension-racking lull before the next big scream.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 813 p.m. EDT October 18 2012Franchises latest adds webcams and night vision but no new scares.Dont look for anything new aside from the recording technology in found footage fright film Paranormal Activity 4 starring Kathryn Newton.(Photo Dean Hendler Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review   out of fourStars Katie Featherston Kathryn Newton Matt Shively; Directors Henry Joost Ariel SchulmanRated R; Runtime 1 hour 28 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideThe franchise that capitalized on the found-footage craze has gotten lost.Theres virtually nothing new in the dull Paranormal Activity 4 (  stars out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) except for a modification in the method of documenting the spooky shenanigans. Most of the creepy stuff is recorded via a laptop webcam or video chats instead of a standard video camera.The Paranormal movies hinge on the increasingly popular concept of found footage in which large swaths of the story are presented as a homemade video capturing unseen ghostly events. While the first Paranormal Activity in 2007 was fresh and genuinely frightening the concept has grown stale and gimmicky. In this sloppy installment some visuals dont even fall within found-footage parameters or adhere to the storys internal logic.Potential terrors lack originality or are never fully realized. Rather than moving the story forward by fleshing out the ghost story thats been evolving over the previous three films directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman rely on goosing the audience with false scares and bland jolts.With its nerve-jangling deployment of ordinary household items gone mysteriously awry the first film was a phenomenon. This time the things that go bump in the night are run-of-the-mill bangs clatters slams and thuds that rarely elicit the jitters jumps and screams that audiences experienced in the first couple films.BOWLES Found-footage movies are so successful its scaryMORE Latest news reviews amp; coverage of all things film at USA TODAY MoviesFifteen-year-old Alex (Kathryn Newton) lives in a spacious house with her rather disconnected parents and little brother. When Robbie (Brady Allen) a strange little boy living next door comes to stay with them for a few days malevolent weirdness ensues. Alex and her pal Ben (Matt Shively) decide to investigate whats going on setting up laptops to record events in several rooms utilizing motion-sensing equipment with tracking dots and night vision. But some of the images that vaguely emerge seem to lead nowhere except perhaps to eye strain. This follow-up feels scattershot and pointless riding on the coattails of its predecessors. Potentially frightening elements are introduced then dropped or never fully played out. Once the scares start happening -- slowly -- the terror quotient remains muted. A neighborhood witches coven plays into the proceedings. But it is more silly than fearsome.The longevity of the Paranormal Activity series is keyed to originality. How many times can the filmmakers keep re-warming the same old story? How many times can bodies be violently dragged from their beds until the viewer is inured to the terrifying visuals?If the folks behind Paranormal are intent on churning them out then the films need to be more imaginative conjuring up new kinds of scares.Paranormal Activity 4 is more like Paranormal Stasis. 91 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/PE3fet,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/10/18/paranormal-activity-4-review/1635161/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,paranormalactivity410,paranormalactivity4,usatoday

When Katie suddenly appears it implies that Robbie is in fact Hunter though it seems she has some dark designs on young Wyatt.Directed like ""Paranormal Activity 3"" by the team of Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman this time from a story by Chad Feehan and screenplay by series regular Christopher Landon this films strong suit is that it finally feels contemporary.The use of computer webcams and the strange sensation of backward motion that comes from someone carrying a laptop while walking and chatting is both familiar and disorienting (though there is nothing quite as ingenious as the sequence in the third film in which the camera was placed on a rotating fan for an unyielding pan back and forth across a room).PHOTOS Movies dealing with possessionIn one especially effective visual motif small beams of light from a video game system create an eerie star field in a darkened room.""Paranormal Activity 4"" is in many ways one big setup building to a single inevitable whats-behind-you jump scare and then a rollicking finale a one that implies a deeper mythology opening the door (but of course) for another sequel.mark.olsenlatimes.comParanormal Activity 4MPAA rating R for language and some violence/terrorRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESParanormal Activity 4 offers the same old scares critics...October 19 2012New on DVDJanuary 22 2012Paranormal Activity 3 scares off competitionOctober 24 2011Movie review Paranormal Activity 3October 21 2011Movie Projector Paranormal Activity 3 to frighten rivalsOctober 20 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowFilmNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-paranormal-activity-4-review-20121019,0,3345199.story",200,paranormalactivity411,paranormalactivity4,latimes

(Photo credit Dean Hendler / Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 18 2012 152 PM Title Paranormal Activity 4 Film Info Video footage shows creepy shenanigans by a suburban demon. Directors Henry Joost Ariel Schulman. (135) R Language some violence. Area theaters. Magic moment With the press of a button the camera watches as the living room is lit with iridescent dots. Here it comes The creaking noise a vague whirr of anticipation the graininess the stop-and-start scares. Its ... a laptop. And its the whoo-hoo innovation of ""Paranormal Activity 4."" As ""a-ha"" ideas go this ranks slightly below ""PA 3s"" hook when we saw why in the 1980s a girl named Katie became the obsession of an invisible demon called Toby. In this years edition the adult Katie (Katie Featherston) is back. After a brief video shoutout to the baby abducted two paranormal activities ago ""PA 4"" picks up in 2011 as grade-schooler Wyatt notices a strange neighbor kid across the street. Wyatts teenage sister Alex (Kathryn Newton) sees the boy as well hiding in her old treehouse. The strange kid Robbie (Brady Allen) winds up spending a few days at Wyatts house when the woman he calls ""Mom"" -- Katie -- is mysteriously spirited away by an ambulance one night. Soon laptops provided by Alexs annoying boyfriend (Matt Shively) are filming Robbies late-night wanderings as well as floating knives strange toy formations and doors opening sloowwlyyy . ""PA 4s"" best idea besides reintroducing the slow-walking statuesque Katie is a strange video trick involving lots of little lights filling a darkened room. Its tough to describe but the cameras of course capture a figure the characters cant. What hard-working directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (who also did ""PA 3"" as well as the tricksy faux-documentary ""Catfish"") cant capture is the correct ratio of scares-to-tedium. These movies with their meta-You Tube frights live or die on those. There are a few jolts yet most are from someone jumping into the frame (which quickly grow tiresome). And theres of course a promise of more activity to come. But unless moviegoers think its worth watching another whole cast of characters sleep while their furniture moves around them only diehard fans will stay awake for that next entry.

In its new chapter the once-terrific minimalist horror series takes a nose dive by simply repeating old gimmicks By Richard Corliss Oct. 18 2012 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Dean Hendler / Paramount Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture A shock to the system is an event. Someone tiptoes up behind you and goes boo A car zips out of a side street into your lane. A door slowly blows closed. That last one in the original Paranormal Activity made movie audiences jump in tandem as if ordered to by a gym teacher. Ah the pleasures of horror-movie subtlety when the conventions of the genre are stripped to the bone and the scariest part is not the monster but the waiting. In so many ways Oren Pelis film proved that less is more. Shot in a week in 2007 for 15000 and finally released in 2009 it earned 193.4 million at theaters around the world. PA and its two sequels have totted up a 576.6 million global gross on a production investment of about 8 million or a 72 return on every dollar spent shooting. But when you expect the shock -- hear the tiptoeing spot the car see the same spooky door in another film -- thats merely a habit. Attending a Paranormal movie is now just that a rite of fall with predictable autumnal shivers like a Halloween jaunt in say Alaska. Not missing a trick or a treat the entertainment-industrial complex has extended a single fright night into an entire season in theme parks (Universal Floridas Halloween Horror Nights which stretch over six weeks beginning Sept. 21 now in its 22nd year) at kitsch museums (Madame Tussauds Chamber of Horrors) and in Hollywoods fall schedule of pre-Halloween horror films. This year The Possession began the ghoul parade in late summer Aug.31 and it has continued with a new haunted-house movie nearly every week. (READ Corliss on the Paranormal phenomenon) As the series that challenged Saw the previous pre-Halloween king and quickly beheaded it the PA franchise has stopped innovating and turned into a familiar theme-park-like attraction the same reliable recyclable experience the same methods employed with the minutest variations. Thats certainly the case with Paranormal Activity 4 which will lure about 5 million people to theaters this weekend. The movie is an October surprise without the surprise. You go not to be scared but to remember the thrills you felt watching the first film. Instead of a journey into fear PA4 is a nostalgia trip -- deja boo all over again. In the first movie set in Carlsbad Calif. in 2006 Katie Featherston and Micah Stoat (the actors used their real names) moved into a house that gave hints of being in a really bad mood. The door moved; shadows crept across walls; an unseen figure slipped under the bedcovers. We saw this because Micah had set up a video-recording device in the bedroom; a timer spun or froze to capture the inexplicable evidence. (SPOILER ALERTS coming on plots of the first three films) By the end Micah was dead and Katie demonized. PA2 operated on parallel tracks with the first film showing Katies sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and her son Hunter; Katie kills Kristi and abducts Hunter. The third film flashed back to 1986 when Katie and Kristi were kids and the root of the trouble -- a coven of demons -- was revealed. So far so cool. The second and third episodes though lacking the innovations of the original built on its found-footage ingenuity and point-of-view rigor. PA3 was directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman who had invested their ""documentary"" Catfish with such rich characterization that TIME named one of its subjects as a Best Performer of 2010. Given the reins again for PA4 -- and again directing a script by Christopher Landon (who wrote the second and third episodes -- Joost and Schulman were expected to lend body and (lost) soul to the central mythology for this is the first film to move the larger story forward chronologically from 2006. (READ Mary Pols review of Catfish) Its now 2011 in Henderson Nev. and were in the home of a normal-for-now family Mom and Dad (Alexondra Lee and Stephen Dunham) their 15-year-old daughter Alex (Kathryn Newton) and 6-year-old son Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp). When the woman who moved into the house across the street is taken to the hospital with an unknown complaint the family takes her moody son Robbie (Brady Allen) in for a few days. Stuff happens and to record the spookiness Alexs boyfriend Ben (Matt Shively) hooks up more surveillance equipment -- Mac laptops XBox Kinect Skype -- than Claire Danes sneaked into Damian Lewiss home in the first season of Homeland. Need I say more? O.K. thank you I will. (Hardly any SPOILER ALERTS here. Most of this is revealed in the trailers.) A basketball slowly bounces down the steps to the living room. Moms kitchen knife flies out of sight when she isnt looking. (Itll be back.) Robbies invisible friend becomes in night vision semivisible. On Wyatts bedroom wall the invisible friend scrawls his name Hunter. Robbie warns Ben ""He doesnt like you""; and when Ben asks ""Who doesnt like me?"" the child replies ""Youll find out."" Wyatt who was adopted says ""My family needs me back."" Plus a levitation a neck snap a creepy bathtub scene some mischief in a garage and the return of the Katie coven. (READ Mary Pols review of Paranormal Activity 2) Horror movies have borrowed from other horror movies since -- since probably the second horror movie. Youll note references to The Shining Poltergeist Rosemarys Baby Halloween Night of the Living Dead and dozens more but mainly to earlier PA episodes. Not so much an advance as a remake with a different cast PA4 repeats tropes from earlier in the series but less impactfully. One of the cool moments in PA3 was when the dining-room furniture disappeared then suddenly dropped from the ceiling (this brilliantly shown from a camera attached to a rotating ceiling fan). This time a chandelier crashes and a couple of pieces of furniture move themselves -- pallid reprises. The new movie nearly chokes on these replays and has more fake shock moments (people who scare people) than real ones. The audience no less than the filmmakers can calibrate the ""surprises"" with a stop watch wait wait... and go. And for all the video documentation of awful phenomena Alex never bothers to show her parents the evidence and convince them shes not paranoid but truly persecuted. (READ Corlisss review of Paranormal Activity 3) One of the pleasures of the first film was feeling the community of moviegoers. Maybe they were frightened maybe they just enjoyed pretending to be but the crowd reacted to the minimalist terrors as one jittery organism. At the PA4 screening people still emitted ooohs and eeks but the expressions of fear had a rehearsed air as if the folks at the Regal E-Walk on 42nd Street had morphed into the Rocky Horror Picture Show acolytes of decades past who were self-consciously and ironically part of the movie. (At least the Regal crowd didnt have to dress in drag.) One trailer for PA4 shows folks at a preview screening purportedly scared witless as if its a preview screaming. Were the audience members paid actors? Or has reality TV and the universal need to be YouTubed for 15 minutes turned every citizen into a ham for the camera? The big bummer of PA4 is that until literally the final shots it doesnt elaborate seriously on the grander question -- the big ""Whats Katie up to?"" The TV series The X Files mixed stand-alone episodes with a few times a season further hints on the ""mythology"" Mulders lost brother Scullys child the Smoking Mans mission etc. PA4 doesnt provide nearly enough clues; in TV this episode would be called a rerun. The ponderous pace of revelations makes you wonder how many PA films the series guardians have planned before the faithful actually learn something. Or maybe the filmmakers are content to keep coasting on autopilot retracing their greatest hits. Theres a point at which movies become only merchandise and the Paranormal franchise may be heading for that nexus that nadir. (SEE Find Paranormal Activity on the all-TIME Top 25 Horror Movies list) In TV the moment when a hit series gets desperate and either does something ludicrous or reworks old episodes is called ""jumping the shark."" The Paranormal team has to rethink what its doing with this intriguing notion. Otherwise it will have jumped the shock.

PARAMOUNT Okay dont move. Dont move. Just sit there. Sit there and read this. Are you reading this? Okay keep reading. Dont move. Just sit there reading this and reading this and then when you -- Boo Pretty scary huh? Well okay maybe not. But lulling people into a false sense of security and then jumping out at them has made billions for horror-movie directors -- and a very nice chunk of change for the smart minds (and studio) behind the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise. They took that old idea and ran with it inventing a bare-bones chiller about a couple living in a bland house where things suddenly go bump in the night. So the shutterbug hubby sets up some security cameras and while the couple sleeps we watch. And jump. By the fourth-go-round though the story (an angry demon a possessed young woman) and the gimmick (people with camcorders who film everything even when theyre being chased by said possessed woman) are getting a little lifeless themselves. Yes there are still shocks. There will always be shocks when youve been lulled into a slightly dulled unsuspecting state and all of a sudden ... Boo See what I mean? But theres nothing very new to the shocks. (Even the sound of them is the same.) And at this point the ""mythology"" (Okay who was behind this cult again and why did they call up this demon?) is getting a little hard to keep track of. Its nice that Katie Featherston is back as the demon lady; with her sweet baby-round face shes not the sort of person you expect to go around cracking necks. And young Kathryn Newton is lovely as the unsuspecting neighbor girl. (Hmm did someone say ""sacrificial virgin""?) Theres also in its own weird way a certain kind of avant-garde twist to this kind of moviemaking. Since the time of D.W. Griffith directors have literally directed where we look with editing camera movement and close-ups. Watch her. Pay attention to this. By relying heavily on static points of view however (this time cleverly incorporating webcams and Skype) the ""Paranormal Activity"" series seemingly removes that directorial authority. Someones still in charge of course but were not conscious of it. We have to scan the frame ourselves constantly looking for clues warnings danger. And that both deeply involves us in whats happening and refuses to provide the comforts of an obvious structure. Theres a truly experimental edge to that kind of filmmaking and one that might be worthy of real study. Or certainly of more exploration by a better filmmaker with a more ambitious aim of examining different ways of seeing. But instead its been taken over by a bunch of pranksters with no larger goal than jumping out regularly and shouting -- Boo Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Paranormal Activity 4 (R) Paramount (88 min.) Directed by Henry Joost Ariel Schulman. With Katie Featherston Kathryn Newton. Now playing in New Jersey.

Daily Edition Login to download Paranormal Activity 4 Film Review 116 AM PDT 10/17/2012 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS This once-innovative series rolls on without much regard for either plot or character development. TWITTER Katie Featherston makes only a brief reappearance in the latest installment of the urban-legend horror franchise. Mockumentary filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (Catfish) know a thing or two about misdirecting an audience as they proved again with 2011s Paranormal Activity 3. Together with returning screenwriter Christopher Landon this time around they seem short on new ideas however relying more on the series reputation for low-budget thrills to attract audiences. Regardless by now Paramounts franchise is a brand unto itself and its unlikely that anything will stop the first few waves of fans boosting Paranormal Activity 4 up the chart until at least through Halloween. Quickly recapping with flashbacks and documentary-style introductory cards the conclusion of Paranormal Activity 2 when in a prequel to 2007s original film Katie (Katie Featherston) killed her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) and abducted her nephew Hunter (William Juan Prieto) the current version jumps ahead to 2011 relocating the action from California to Nevada and introducing an entirely new family. Teenager Alex (Kathryn Newton) her 6-year-old brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp) and their parents (Stephen Dunham and Alexondra Lee) live a typical middle-class suburban life even if they think their neighbors across the street -- single mother Katie and her young son Robbie (Brady Allen) -- are a bit of an odd pair. After Katie is unexpectedly and mysteriously admitted to the hospital for some unknown illness Alexs mom inexplicably offers to take Robbie in while his mother is recovering. Alex soon begins to notice strange events coincident with Robbies arrival while the young visitors insinuations increasingly draw Wyatt away from her. Other family members also begin to clue into the strange goings-on with mysterious sounds shifting furniture and alarmingly animated household objects suggesting something is seriously amiss. With the help of her boyfriend Ben (Matt Shively) Alex sets up the familys home video cameras and laptops to record Robbies late-night wanderings and vaguely sinister activities around the house. As Alex becomes more convinced that some evil presence is seeking her out the mysterious forces behind Robbies visit become more assertive squarely threatening the familys survival while inexorably tracking back to the earlier abduction of Hunter. By now the basis of the Paranormal Activity franchise concerning Katies possession by a demonic force that results in a series of malevolently haunted houses is well-known to those who care to follow each new iteration. The fourth installment adds very little new information while playing out the inevitably unpleasant outcomes that await the characters preferring to recycle plot elements from previous films. Fairly mild in tone and riffing -- if not quite ripping -- off a collection of horror classics that includes The Shining Rosemarys Baby and Poltergeist both the franchises premise and its execution nevertheless remain rudimentary with the narrative and character backstories representing more of a sketch than a fully realized vision of the supernatural world that Katie inhabits. Although Newton and Shively are likable enough in their roles as the sleuthing teens the other performances remain perfunctory overall. Laptop webcams and camera phones are substituted for the earlier video-surveillance cams but little has changed visually in the style of the filmmakers alternation of static and frantic handheld shots mixed with a surfeit of distracting closeups. Asymmetrically framed scenes staccato editing techniques and oppressive ambient sound (and the ominous lack of a score) are substituted for any real narrative development leaving a plot essentially consisting of a series of setups followed by frightening payoffs. Weak attempts to introduce a smattering of satanic symbology are belatedly superfluous. Its just such lack of creative investment that inevitably leads to further sequels if a theatrical audience can actually be sustained going forward.

A battle between horror conventions and innovations has been steadily brewing over the course of the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise and in the fourth film the conventional finally wins. Less reliant on slow-burn suspense and larded with fake-out jump scares this is the first sequel in the series that fails to advance the overall mythology in any meaningful way. Whether the faster pace and less inventive thrills will matter to hardcore fans theres little indication the ""Paranormal"" brand has worn out its commercial appeal just yet. B.O. should be positively frightful (in a good way) through the Halloween season. Small children chatting with spirits. A virginal teenage protagonist fending off her horny boyfriend. Creepy neighbors dabbling in the occult. Auds have seen it all before which would be less of a concern if this ""Paranormal"" followed in its predecessors footsteps and found fresh ways to spin familiar tropes. Instead directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman and screenwriter Christopher Landon (all returning from ""Paranormal Activity 3"") seem to be suffering from creative malaise settling for a few too many shots of doors ominously opening on their own and multiple instances of the family cat scampering past the camera to deliver a sudden jolt. ""Paranormal Activity 3"" circled back to the past to explore the childhood of the first two movies sibling protagonists Katie and Kristi. The fourth film picks up five years after the end of part two when Katie disappeared into the night with her infant nephew Hunter after murdering her sister. Using their whereabouts as a lingering question the film introduces two 6-year-old boys. Robbie (Brady Allen) a loner with a proclivity for menacing asides lives across the street from Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp) a rambunctious lad with a lovely teenage sister Alex (Kathryn Newton) and two stable parents Doug (Stephen Dunham) and Holly (Alexondra Lee). A mysterious accident at Robbies house forces the neighbors to become his temporary caretakers; Alex is the only one who notices all the unsettling things that coincide with Robbies arrival. Even before Alex and her wisecracking b.f. Ben (Matt Shively) rig the home with cameras to provide the series trademark nighttime video recording the film plays fast and loose with the requisite found-footage style. Viewers are rarely clued in as to whats being used to film the action or why its being recorded at all other than what seems like Alexs obsessive need to carry around her computer and engage in frequent videochats with Ben. Eventually the creepy notion emerges that various webcams in the house are permanently recording whether their users know it or not but the filmmakers never really follow through on the paranoid potential inherent in such an invasion of privacy. The pics sole visual novelty comes from the use of the Xbox Kinect gaming accessory which blankets the family living room with tiny green projection dots visible only when captured by an infrared camera. The gimmick adds an otherworldly quality to select nighttime sequences while doubling as a quirky bit of product placement. At least its more original than the multitude of setpieces blurring the line between ripoff and homage in the pics use of a Big Wheel tricycle (""The Shining"") levitating body (""The Exorcist"") and bathtub (""A Nightmare on Elm Street""). Performances are fairly routine for the genre though young leading lady Newton summons agreeable echoes of Dakota Fanning and Evan Rachel Wood. Tech credits are also in line with expectations but the creeping intrusion of flashy visual effects and prosthetic makeup into what started as a low-tech series may not be to everyones liking. Gregory Plotkins editing further violates unwritten franchise rules by breaking up the ""found footage"" with jarring cuts occasionally utilized for quick shocks. The film is dedicated to the memory of Dunham who died of a heart attack last month. In addition to playing his onscreen wife here Lee was Dunhams spouse offscreen as well.
