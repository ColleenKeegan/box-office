Comments The Young Victoria Recommended 2010 Smartly scripted by Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park) this historical romance chronicles the early reign of Queen Victoria played with admirable intelligence and feeling by Emily Blunt. Like Shekhar Kapurs Elizabeth (1998) the movie is a crafty mix of love story and postfeminist parable charting Victorias blooming relationship with her first cousin Albert (Rupert Friend) even as it considers the complex problems of a woman wielding power in a mans world. Fellowes labors to unite both elements at the very end and his partly invented climax seems a shame given his otherwise careful elucidation of the political landscape Victoria was forced to negotiate. But this may be the perfect shared entertainment for daughters just growing out of their princess phase and mothers with their own challenges balancing love and work. Jean-Marc Vallee directed; among the crack supporting cast are Paul Bettany Miranda Richardson Jim Broadbent and Mark Strong. PG 100 min. By J.R.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Emily Blunt is said to have fought hard to land the title role in ""The Young Victoria and ambition is the steel spine that underlies and enlivens even this actresss softest performances. Her grit surfaces here and there throughout the movie a sweet stodgy historical romance about the difficulties of being a queen and a young woman not necessarily in that order. I have an image of Blunt looking wildly about for a royal to play Blanchett got the young Elizabeth I Mirren got Elizabeth II Dench got old Elizabeth I and old Victoria. Whos left? Lady Jane Grey? A patsy. Bloody Mary? Too nasty. Empress Matilda? Who cares? Wait . . .So we have ""The Young Victoria the word ""The added to prevent wags from mistaking the movie for ""Young Frankenstein. Written by Julian Fellowes (""Gosford Park) and directed by Canadas Jean-Marc Vallee its lavishly appointed tosh that very effectively dramatizes the growing love between Victoria and her first cousin and eventual husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Rupert Friend) and turns distracted and busy whenever it deals with history.Your heart sinks in fact when the opening title cards establishing the historical context leave you scrambling to take notes. Gradually we piece together that the teenage Victoria is a balky pawn in the hands of her mother the Duchess of Kent (a thin-lipped Miranda Richardson) and her ""adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong almost as dastardly as in ""Sherlock Holmes).As sole heir of her uncle King William IV (a magnificently blithering Jim Broadbent) Victoria has the British empire as her rightful due and everyone wants a piece of her. As in 1998s ""Elizabeth the drama is in watching an untested girl navigate a sea of sharks to reach the scepter that belongs to her alone.The difference is that Victoria has someone swimming alongside her. As ""The Young Victoria portrays it Albert is initially handsome bait dangled by his uncle King Leopold of Belgium (Thomas Kretschmann) to gain influence in British politics. Both the future queen and the young prince understand this. The shock is that they warm to each other genuinely and with a secret glee. Theyre two shy children of privilege who realize that no one else but they - and certainly not the grown-ups - understand what theyre going through.The scenes of the couples courtship and marriage then are extremely charming and even weirdly erotic because both Blunt and the underrated Friend (""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont) carve out a rich emotional intimacy in the midst of all that duty.Where ""The Young Victoria trips over its diamond-encrusted shoelaces though is in keeping up with the political whirl surrounding the young queens ascension. Paul Bettany plays Lord Melbourne with a crafty smile and a leonine head of hair and if youre not paying attention youll miss that this noble who offers to be Victorias private secretary is also the sitting prime minister.Their relationship in fact led to a crisis in Parliament and in the streets as the opposition objected to Melbournes undue influence. This results in some unconvincing muttering among the barely seen masses one rock through a window and a rattled Albert getting off a few good barbs against Melbourne.Its a muddled but plush experience overall and if youre a royalist completist or a historical romantic youll probably have a decent time. As much as Blunt may have wanted the role though Im not sure it suits her. The star ably shows us the earnest young ruler while giving us glimpses of the we-are-not-amused public statue Victoria would become and she conveys the ardor of an isolated girl realizing with some astonishment that she has a soul mate.But the role calls for a good dollop of British royal naivete and Blunt to be blunt cant dull her edges enough to play it. We never really believe Sir John or Lord Melbourne or King Leopold constitutes a threat to this girl and without that any dramatic suspense evaporates into topiary and velvet. The actress has altered the queens cape to fit but its her ambition not Victorias that keeps peeking through.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Granite-hipped toad- faced and as stern as her scepter Queen Victoria was born to be a statue. But what if she wasnt? Covering the years just before and just after she assumed the throne at age 18 ""The Young Victoria"" redefines her as a haughty hottie who learned political chess at an age when she wasnt allowed to walk down the stairs by herself. Casting Emily Blunt in the title role the movie effectively lays out how Victoria outsmarted her enemies assumed the UK throne found herself a stable husband and settled in for a 63-year reign. Youre bound to well with patriotic pride if you happen to be German. The young princess (whose first language was German and whose relations are seen referring to her as ""Schatzi"" which in my rhyming dictionary shares some unfortunate company) is a determined young beauty working on an awkward long-distance relationship with the nephew of the king of Belgium. His not-really-all-that-Belgian name Albert von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha. The films portrait of Her Majesty as a pretty nice girl may persuade you only a bit more than the Sinead OConnor love ballad that wafts over the closing credits (""Theres oooonly me and only yoooou."" Well yes and a few hundred million subjects). But a refined script from Julian Fellowes (who won an Oscar for writing ""Gosford Park"") clearly explains the political intrigue the romance the protocol annoyances the duty. I didnt quite believe that this tiny girl could become the most powerful woman in the history of the world but at the time perhaps no one believed it. Moving into the just-completed Buckingham Palace Victoria discovers the place is freezing. Apparently one footman is in charge of laying the fire someone else in charge of lighting it. Worse When it comes time to make a match with Prince Albert (a puppyish Rupert Friend) the rulebook says she must propose to him in stark reversal of the more modern practice in which the woman simply intimidates the man into proposing. Meanwhile the evil Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong who really isnt -- as in next weeks ""Sherlock Holmes"" hes nasty without being interesting) angles to make Victoria his puppet while the cool canny Prime Minister Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) guides the teen Queen around the traps. So close is their friendship -- which the movie portrays as a full-on flirtation -- that hecklers call Victoria ""Mrs. Melbourne"" at the opera. A constitutional crisis looms when Victoria refuses to appoint ladies in waiting allied with Melbournes rival incoming Prime Minister Robert Peel. Fellowes makes all of these elements fresh without aggressively pushing the line that old times were just like modern ones. All three points of the love triangle meanwhile are appealing wreathed in tender looks and long walks in the gardens. Staking out the center of recent royal dramas -- nowhere near as dank and ruthless as Cate Blanchetts ""Elizabeth"" but weightier than Helen Mirrens ""The Queen"" -- ""The Young Victoria"" achieves a fine balance. I guess thats what you get when a film is produced by both Martin Scorsese and Sarah Ferguson.

And her edict would have been wise because Emily Blunt is utterly charming in this dramatization of the young Victorias ascension to the throne and her courtship with Prince Albert. In the hands of director Jean-Marc Vallee and screenwriter Julian Fellowes The Young Victoria adheres -- mostly -- to history. Its romanticized with Victorias beloved Albert (Rupert Friend) a more eager suitor than history indicates. And the movie may give British political scholars fits because Lord Melbourne the 58-year-old Prime Minister who coached Victoria in politics and queenly affairs is played here by the dashing and quite youthful Paul Bettany excising 20 years and at least as many pounds from Lord M.s real person. (See the top 10 movie performances of 2009.) In 1837 the teenage Victoria was heir to the throne held by her uncle King William (Jim Broadbent) but living in royal lockdown at Kensington Palace. ""Even a palace can be a prison"" she tells us. Were well acquainted with the downside of royalty thanks to the current Windsors chatty ex-in-laws but Victoria isnt just whinging. She sleeps in a room with her German-born mother the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) has only her spaniel Dash for a playmate and isnt allowed to walk down stairs alone. Her governess the Baroness Lehzen (Jeanette Hain) is the closest thing she has to a friend. The Duchess and her ""adviser"" (in both boudoir and boardroom) the glowering Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) try to strong-arm Victoria into signing over her power to her mother just in case King William dies before she turns 18. We want her to be Queen so she can finally say ""Off with his head."" Conroy is the films only outright villain but hes not really much source of tension once shes Queen shes the boss. Nor are Lord M. or Lehzen even though they try to manipulate the young Queen because this is primarily a love story. It certainly has sturdy roots Victoria ruled for 63 years and adored Albert so much that she wore black for the 40 years she was widowed. (Its believed in some quarters that she did find love again with manservant John Brown but thats a different movie called Mrs. Brown.) But was it a wild love story for both parties? It can be a challenge to trust historical dramas. Were so used to being duped that even while were enjoying a scene we may think its all made up. The Young Victoria features the jolly King William at his birthday banquet quite in his cups trashing Victorias mother. Its a funny bit ending with Richardson huffing off and some dry old man saying ruefully ""Families."" This scene has the mark of something written expressly for Broadbent by Fellowes but in Lytton Stracheys biography Queen Victoria and again in Christopher Hibberts youll find that scene told exactly as it is onscreen. The only difference is that Blunts Victoria doesnt burst into tears as the real princess apparently did; the movie heroine has more backbone. Shes also less gushy and girlish (Romy Schneider covered that ground in 1954s Victoria in Dover). Victoria left ample and surprisingly intimate diaries as well as her sketchbooks which provided evidence of her platonic infatuation with Lord M. (she mostly got misty-eyed over the idea of him as a young man) and her nearly instantaneous attraction to her cousin Albert whom she described as ""extremely handsome ... he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth"" -- which is certainly true of Friend. But perhaps in deference to the contemporary audiences desire to see Victoria as a Queen shaping her own destiny the movie tilts the balance of romantic power somewhat giving us a Victoria gradually won over by Alberts attentions. He grumbles to his brother about the political nature of the courtship (""What do you say about a man who waits for a rich woman?"") but hes soon got the mushy look of a man more than ready to fulfill his duty. The suggestion is that hell offer her an alliance of equals. Discussing the subject of husbands and political games over a chess match he tells her ""I should recommend you find one to play it with you rather than for you."" He is as noble and upright as anything out of a Jane Austen novel -- a savior in short. Weve grown so fond of Blunts Victoria that we just want her to have a real friend benefits and all. We may be looking at Victoria and Albert through rose-colored glasses but this love story is a touching romantic confection a fine way to follow up your figgy pudding. Long live Queen Emily.

The Young Victoria Dewy yearning with a core of steel | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentThe Young Victoria Dewy yearning with a core of steelLogic insists that Queen Victoria had to be young once despite the eternal image we all have of her as the crabbed monarch who glares from a photo taken in her later years.Emily Blunt as Victoria survives intrigue to win the throne. Moviegoers though may prefer to see her romance.  (SUBMITTED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 18 2009 Starring Emily Blunt Rupert Friend Paul Bettany and Miranda Richardson. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee. 105 minutes. At major theatres. PG Article Continued BelowLogic insists that Queen Victoria had to be young once despite the eternal image we all have of her as the crabbed monarch who glares from a photo taken in her later years.Was she as peaches-and-cream gorgeous as Emily Blunt depicts her in The Young Victoria? Likely not as archival evidence suggests a much plainer face. But Blunt masters the unblinking countenance and iron will that Victoria possessed qualities the young queen needed to find her way through a gilded maze of knaves and scoundrels.The most startling thing about this sumptuous film isnt the glamour in front of the camera but the perceived politics behind it. Eyes rolled over news that proud Quebecer Jean-Marc Vallee was making a movie about British royalty a revelation that must have caused the chain-smoking ghost of Rene Levesque to erupt in coughing fits.Vallee says he was drawn by the challenge but its likely he saw in Victoria a determined outsider similar to the teen protagonist of his earlier film C.R.A.Z.Y. who fights his repressive Quebec family while grooving to Pink Floyd and David Bowie. (Vallee wanted to use the Floydian tones of Icelands Sigur Ros for his soundtrack to The Young Victoria which would have been fascinating but rights issues forced him to stick to a statelier classical score.) Vallee and screenwriter Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park) share a vision of Victoria as a dewy monarch struggling to serve her subjects while following her heart toward the awkwardly charming Prince Albert and having to do so in the midst of royal machinations that are quite rightly compared to a chess game.What emerges is a genuinely affecting love story although it takes patience to negotiate the early intrigue. Those not fully versed in British history may find it tough figuring out whos zooming who in the powdered-wig antics behind Victorias ascension to the throne in 1838 at the barely legal age of 18.Prior to this Victoria had been caught in a taffy pull of competing interests and agendas. Those doing the yanking include her dotty British uncle King William (Jim Broadbent); her Belgian uncle King Leopold (Thomas Kretschmann) and his compliant nephew Albert (Rupert Friend); her scheming mother the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson); and mommas creepy Svengali and presumed lover Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong).First glimpsed as a sad 11-year-old (Michaela Brooks) forced by her monarch-in-waiting status to abide by confining and lonely rules of conduct Victoria quickly susses that only by taking charge of her own affairs will she achieve any success or happiness. She has no time to lose in growing a backbone because her mother and Conroy seek to have her submit to a formal Regency an agreement by which a young person forfeits the throne to elder caretakers - in other words the Duchess and Sir John.Victoria is aided in her personal growth by the whispered encouragements of the wily prime minister Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) whose motives remain under scrutiny throughout the film.Its only when the focus finally rests on the slowly blossoming romance between Victoria and Albert that The Young Victoria fully exudes warmth and invites empathy. It is here that the pairing of Blunt who most often plays the bitch in films like The Devil Wears Prada and Friend a much more mellow cat seems preordained and providential.She is a wary yet determined lady; he is a deferential yet stubborn gentleman. Together they possess the alchemy to be among the most golden couples seen on the recent screen.We watch in fascination and some amusement as Victoria and Albert settle the terms of a relationship that history records as one of the most fruitful of royal pairings. The result is a movie that honours the past while informing the present.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday December 17 2009 532 PM Title The Young Victoria When we think of Queen Victoria a single indelible image comes to mind -- and it definitely doesnt look like Emily Blunt. But even the most aged matron was a girl once and surely Her Majesty would not object to the appealing portrait Blunt offers in Jean-Marc Vallees ""The Young Victoria.""Still even she might have hoped to see some real spirit in Julian Fellowes script which remains impeccably proper at all times. The result is a biography that is quite enjoyable to watch and a bit too easy to forget.When we meet Victoria she is considered a pawn by factions hoping to capitalize on her youth and gender. Her selfish mother (Miranda Richardson) and manipulative adviser (Mark Strong) are the most demanding and insist she give them regency control. She proves more stubborn than anyone expects and takes the crown at the age of 18 after the death of her uncle (Jim Broadbent). But the maneuvers continue with leaders of various countries -- including her own -- attempting to assume power. For the ruling party in Parliament this means the prime minister (Paul Bettany) insinuating himself as a mentor. For the Belgian king (Thomas Kretschmann) it means sending his nephew Albert (Rupert Friend) to court the queen. While Victoria turns out to be a natural leader her imposed loneliness remains a burden. Albert becomes her partner but its not easy for either to find a balance between romance and regal obligations.Though Blunt is excellent at delivering slightly off-kilter turns its easier to build a performance on quirks than on character. Its a pleasure to see her digging so deep here especially with such a capable cast backing her up. But its clear that all the actors would benefit from a more relaxed approach especially one incorporating some of the freedom and creativity Vallees Victoria yearns for. The film does look beautiful and theres enough intrigue to inspire anyone to learn more about such a complex fascinating life. It just would have been nice to see a little more of that complexity onscreen.

Those of us on this side of the pond have just as long a history of turning them into hits For some reason we cant seem to get enough of watching those stodgy royals in crisis. Movie Information The Young VictoriaRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Jean-Marc ValleeActors Emily Blunt Jim Broadbent Mark Strong and Paul BettanyRun time 104 minutesMPAA rating PG (mild sexual content and violence)Synopsis The story of Queen Victoria produced by Sarah Ferguson Duchess of York.More movies from GuideLive.comThe latest entry in the genre The Young Victoria doesnt rank with the best. But much like 1998s Elizabeth it brings a surprising intensity and snap to a story that warrants no more than a paragraph or two in most American history textbooks.In the 1830s the teenage princess Victoria (the excellent Emily Blunt) finds herself caught between warring factions Her uncle King William (Jim Broadbent) wants to make certain that Victorias Belgian-born mother (Miranda Richardson) doesnt try to grab control of the throne after his death. Victorias Belgian uncle (Thomas Kretschmann) meanwhile begins scheming to get his German-born nephew Albert (Rupert Friend) to win Victorias heart. And then theres Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) the smoothly controlling Parliament member who becomes Victorias closest adviser much to the dismay of everyone around her.Director Jean-Marc Vallees previous film C.R.A.Z.Y. was a coming-of-age drama set in 1970s French-speaking Canada; screenwriter Julian Fellows is best known for the Oscar-winning murder-mystery Gosford Park. These unexpected bedfellows bring visual and verbal wit to the proceedings and they tell a potentially convoluted story with elegant lucidity. The excellent ensemble abets them considerably. (Particular props go to Broadbent whose turn as the cantankerous king is very funny.)If The Young Victoria never transcends its fussy trappings - its still a familiar costume drama - it remains brisk and intelligent not to mention a welcome alternative to the noisy holiday season spectacles currently jamming up the multiplex. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 17 2009 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Apparition films Emily Blunt portrays Queen Victoria right and Rupert Friend portrays Prince Albert in a scene from The Young Victoria. Liam Daniel/Apparition Films/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? If you have a hankering for British royalty and the glories of Empire ""The Young Victoria"" will likely satisfy your craving. But all others be forewarned This movie starring Emily Blunt as Victoria could well have issued from the royal family itself. (Sarah Ferguson in fact is one of the producers.) The film essentially begins in 1837 just before the 18th birthday of Princess Victoria of Kent next in line to the throne owing to the absence of any other heirs of King William (Jim Broadbent acting Dickensian). The machinations of Victorias mother the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) to void her daughters ascension are balanced out by Victorias incipient love duet with Albert (Rupert Friend) the nephew of her uncle Belgian King Leopold (Thomas Kretschmann). Blunt and Friend strike a few flinty sparks and Julian Fellowess script has its share of dry-as-dust witticisms. Most of the time though its a stiff pageant. The director Jean-Marc Vallee is French-Canadian. Mon Dieu Grade C+ (Rated PG for some mild sensuality; a scene of violence; and brief incidental language and smoking.)

"Movie review Long live The Young Victoria starring Emily Blunt washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Young Victoria Movie review Long live The Young Victoria starring Emily Blunt Emily Blunt captures the spirit of a royal in love in ""The Young Victoria."" (Liam Daniel) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 18 2009 Lovers of pomp pageantry and extravagant period detail will find themselves exceedingly well served by ""The Young Victoria"" a visually arresting and sneakily engrossing film about the courtship of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The movie which stars Emily Blunt in the title role and Rupert Friend as Albert accomplishes what the best historical fiction does It sends viewers so gracefully into the rites and habits and language of another era (in this case Victorias ascendancy to the British throne in 1837 at age 18 and her subsequent marriage) that they dont realize how much information theyre absorbing. More than anything ""The Young Victoria"" deserves kudos for dispelling the common image of Queen Victoria -- that rather plump matronly widow with the dour hankie on her head -- and presenting viewers with a beguiling young woman imbued with spirit intelligence and observant wit. Blunt who has provided brilliant comedic support in such films as ""The Devil Wears Prada"" steps regally into the role as the teenage Victoria who as heir to the British throne has been brought up by her mother the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) in near-pathological protectiveness. Even as a teenager Victoria isnt allowed to walk down a flight of stairs unattended. More problematic is the palace intrigue to which Victoria is subjected by her mother uncles and even her devoted governess. Screenwriter Julian Fellowes (""Gosford Park"") limns the power plays with graceful assurance; but as fascinating as Victoria and her political education are its Albert who turns out to be the most sympathetic figure in ""The Young Victoria."" From their courtship over games of chess to the princes search for meaningful work once they are married Albert emerges as an unusually enlightened romantic hero who wins his beloveds heart by treating her as a respected equal. ""The Young Victoria"" may impart copious amounts of detail about its fascinating protagonists but its not a mere tutorial Its a heady thoroughly transporting plunge.  PG. At Landmarks E Street Cinema and Landmarks Bethesda Row. Contains mild sensuality a scene of violence brief profanity and smoking. 100 minutes.

Photo Liam Daniel Apparition Movie review The Young Victoria 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Young Victoria Drama. Starring Emily Blunt Rupert Friend Miranda Richardson and Paul Bettany. Directed by Jean-Marc Vallee. (PG. 119 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) We Americans get intimidated by this sort of thing. So every so often we need to remind ourselves that the mere spectacle of people walking around in 19th century costume and talking with English accents does not automatically constitute an intelligent movie. Case in point this muddled entry known as ""The Young Victoria"" with the future queen played by Emily Blunt who seems about as 19th century as an iPod. If you like this sort of movie - and actually cards on the table I like this kind of movie - you will not be sorry you saw it. But you will not come away from the experience feeling that youve seen Victoria young or otherwise. Moreover the confused script and Jean-Marc Vallees busy direction will not illuminate English politics of the 1830s. To really understand whats going on either read up beforehand or prepare to spend a half hour with the encyclopedia when you return home. Call this a rags-to-riches tale. At the start of the film the young Victoria is not happy because she lives in seclusion with her mother the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her boyfriend Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) and they treat her like shes a complete moron. Soon shell become queen but they dont want her running the country no way. They want her to agree to a regency with Sir John in charge because for some zany reason they think a teenage girl should not be calling the shots in the worlds most powerful nation. ""The Young Victoria"" is about the lead-up to Victorias ascension to the throne and her first years in power. Ideally this might have been the story of how a preternaturally gifted young girl outmaneuvered everybody took the throne and became a political genius and a benevolent leader. But the truth is less clear cut and considerably less interesting at least the way they tell it here. Apparently avoiding a regency turns out to be pretty easy once you pass 18. And running a country isnt that hard either if you make friends with the prime minister and do whatever he says. In this case the PM is Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who establishes with Victoria a genuine and almost familial rapport. Bettany brings an interesting quality to the role playing Melbourne as a fundamentally decent person who has been practicing the political dark arts for so long that hes incapable of spontaneous sincerity. He seems weary of himself. The other strong performance in ""The Young Victoria"" is that of Rupert Friend so mysterious and wayward in ""Cheri"" and now the soul of transparency as Prince Albert. Hes Victorias suitor a sweet capable guy who actually likes Victoria for herself which would not be easy under the best of circumstances. With Blunt playing her as bratty and 21st century its even harder. Julian Fellowes screenplay piles on inessential information in some places then leaves out essentials in others although whatever script problems the movie has are compounded by Vallees direction. Vallee seems so intent to impress that he becomes insensitive to the text visually undercutting information and cluttering up moments in which simple directness is called for. Still if you want to hate ""The Young Victoria"" youll have to work at it. Even at its worst (all the many scenes of Victoria and Albert kissing and rolling around in bed) its diverting in a soap opera way. If you really want to see this movie dont let me talk you out of it. -- Advisory This is fairly wholesome entertainment.

But you know ""even a palace can be a prison"" she muses ruefully.Ah yes. There she is cloistered teen granddaughter of George III next in line for the throne wandering the gilded halls and formal gardens no friends no fun no iPhone.Whats a lonesome heiress presumptive to do?Whether or not director Jean-Marc VallA(c)e and writer Julian Fellowes depiction of the accession of Britains mighty 19th-century monarch is accurate the film theyve made with its candlelight-flooded parlors its royal balls and banquets and its backroom scheming stands as grand entertainment. Its a portrait of a young lady taking to power - tentatively at first but soon with fierce conviction with relish.And Blunt her eyes sparking her manner playful smart and proud shines in the title role. If the film itself isnt brilliant its star most definitely is.Much of the conflict in The Young Victoria comes by way of the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) Victorias mother who closely allied with Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong also the villain in Sherlock Holmes) is set to become regent if the king dies before Victoria turns 18. The duchess and Sir John have their own interests at heart and do their utmost to keep Victoria uncounseled unprepared helpless - wholly dependent on them. If only she would sign the regency papers allowing her mother to run the country.King William IV Victorias uncle cannot stand the duchess and theres a terrific scene at his birthday feast in which William (Jim Broadbent slurring marvelously) lashes out at Victorias mum drenching her in buckets of drunken invective while the assembled throng look on scandalized aghast (and enormously entertained).And then Victoria is crowned and talk of a husband begins in earnest. Of course we know who wins out Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Victorias German-speaking first cousin played here as a soulful man of honor and an eager lover by Rupert Friend.Alberts courtship of the queen is a complicated affair He must gain her trust thwart the ambitions of rivals not seem too intrusive and wait for her proposal. Complicating matters further He seems truly to love her.VallA(c)e shoots in a smooth dreamy style pausing to linger on the exquisite costumes the shiny new digs at Buckingham Palace. (Victoria was the first royal to live there.) A fine cast - Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne Thomas Kretschmann as King Leopold Jeanette Hain as Victorias confidante Baroness Lehzen - keep Blunt on her toes.She smiles she purrs she barks she cries.And the woman she plays reigned for 63 years.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Over the centuries Queen Victoria has become as much a fixed image as a flesh-and-blood historical figure. Stern stout and unyielding shes been transformed into a stand-in for everything repressive and staid in 19th-century Britain. Though at heart a perfectly polite costume drama The Young Victoria gets a minor charge simply by portraying Victoria in the years leading up to and after her coronation at the age of 18. Winningly played by the anything-but-stern Emily Blunt Victoria is presented as a bright vivacious willful and sometimes rash monarch-in-the-making who took the reins away from those who expected to hold them for her. The film around her performance is never so commanding but as a colorful only mildly juiced-up history lesson its effective enough. Director Jean-Marc Vallee bathes the frames in the details of its luxurious surroundings and the screenplay by Gosford Park writer Julian Fellowes does a passable job of laying out all the factions jockeying for power around Blunts Victoria. The film lays on its politics-as-chess-game metaphor a little thick however and its refusal to leave the corridors of power to see the impact of its developments on the country at large makes it feel stuffy after a while. Maybe thats why--in spite of nice work by Miranda Richardson as the Victorias mother and Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne whose mentorship carries a hint of self-interest--The Young Victoria is at its liveliest when focusing on the romance between its heroine and her cousin Albert Of Saxe-Coburg And Gotha (Rupert Friend) which--here at least--begins as an attempt at power consolidation and blooms into true love. Blunt and Friend generate an impressive amount of sexual tension via courtly letters and chaperoned conversations. Even under constricted circumstances and in the middle of constricted movies hearts cant hide their passions.

"Young Victoria The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; young-victoria-the ) Young Victoria The (United Kingdom/United States 2009) December 14 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Young Victoria which was selected as the closing film of the 2009 Toronto Film Festival (a position that often attracts mediocrity) isnt so much poorly made as it is uninspired. Its hard to determine whether the root cause is that the early years of Victorias reign were inherently dull or whether the production makes them seem that way. With a muddled focus that cant hone in on whether this should be a period piece romance or a dissection of the cloak-and-dagger politics of the day The Young Victoria never gels. The pedestrian screenplay and lackluster direction by French Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc VallA(c)e disallow the members of a generally fine cast to accomplish much with their roles. The Young Victoria feels like a wasted opportunity and is among the least impressive in a long line of motion pictures about British royalty. The film starts out juicily enough. Victoria (Emily Blunt) is a year shy of her majority and her mother the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and the head of her household Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) are already plotting how to control the youthful monarch once she ascends to the throne upon the death of King William (Jim Broadbent). They want her to sign papers making them regents but she refuses. They continue to scheme but at this point the movie loses interest in them. They show up from time-to-time during the rest of the film but in marginalized roles. The story shifts to the romance between Victoria and Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) who has been sent from Germany by his uncle to gain influence over the young soon-to-be queen. Meanwhile on the home front Victoria has fallen under the spell of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) the Prime Minister who wants to shape her opinions and use her as a political trump card. Historically The Young Victoria is reasonably accurate although its portrayal of King Leopold of Belgium (Thomas Kretschmann) Victorias uncle and one of her principal advisors is in a negative light. The film covers only the period from 1836 (a year before she became queen) until 1841 with a couple of brief flash-forwards at the end. As the title implies it is not a comprehensive look at Victorias reign. A more dramatically compelling film about the queen which chronicles her later years is 1997s Mrs. Brown. A better rendition of the segment of Victorias life covered in this movie can be found in the 2001 TV mini-series Victoria amp; Albert which is available on DVD. The most fascinating elements of films about rulers relate to the behind-the-scenes politicking backstabbing and influence peddling. Theres plenty of that going on in The Young Victoria - Conroys failed attempt to strong-arm his future liege into making him a regent or personal secretary Melbourne establishing ""control"" over her and Alberts shaking off the leash placed upon him by Leopold. None of the various plots however are strongly developed and the screenplay credited to Julian Fellowes (who has written a number of classic adaptations for British TV) keeps them mostly in the background. Those who enjoy movies about royalty for the delight of seeing the monarch outwit and overmatch his/her opponents will find little to appreciate in The Young Victoria. The romance between Victoria and Albert is intended to be the films emotional centerpiece but it comes across as tepid. Theres not much of a spark between Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. The films attempts to spice up their sex life (to the extent that anything can be considered to be ""spiced up"" in a PG-rated movie) raises an eyebrow when one considers that Victorias lasting legacy may have been her strict code of morality. Ultimately one almost feels more affection from Victoria for her pet spaniel than for Albert. Emily Blunt normally known for fiery performances (as in My Summer of Love and The Devil Wears Prada) is surprisingly bland here never really bringing Victoria to life. Her task isnt made easier by an equal lack of animation evident in Friends work. Paul Bettany is solid but his role is secondary. The same can be said of Miranda Richardson. Mark Strong has the makings of a good villain but after his early attempts to force Victoria into signing a regency agreement he disappears into the background. (He gets a chance to be a more substantive bad guy in Guy Ritchies Sherlock Holmes.) Jim Broadbent is in fine form but hes in so little of the film (about three scenes before his character dies) that his participation is easily forgotten. As is almost always the case with British period pieces The Young Victoria is a visual treat. The coronation scene with its colorful palette and rousing rendition of ""Zadok the Priest"" offers a mesmerizing cinematic moment. VallA(c)e displays an excellent eye for the time period if not for the characters inhabiting his drama. (There are also instances in which the dialogue sounds jarringly modern.) For those who are students of the British monarchy the film represents a curiosity - a chance to see how a group of filmmakers have chosen to represent this phase of history on the screen. For the average movie-goer however the film lacks the verve necessary to make the tale engrossing in the way Elizabeth did. (To be fair the 1500s make for more rousing cinema than the 1800s.) The result is a well-mounted production that comes across as a little dull rambling and undercooked.

Laboring under lampshade millinery hair that looks like cake and more sumptuous banqueting than we should ever have to sit through Emily Blunt is cute sassy and wildly improbable as the titular Majesty-in-waiting who in life was a short dumpy policy wonk and energetic social reformer. Biding her time to get out from under her vixen mother (Miranda Richardson as always) and manipulative adviser Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany a perpetually raised eyebrow) who wages war with other pols over her head the willful young minx makes eyes across the water at hubby-to-be Albert (Rupert Friend a total stiff well cast for once as the earnest Teuton who would sire nine children with Victoria). Sagging beneath reams of expository dialogue by Julian Fellowes who also wrote the far naughtier Gosford Park The Young Victoria reproduces the premise of The Queen (she outsmarts her worldlier advisers) with none of that movies cheek or verve. Plodding from one brocaded talkathon to the next director Jean-Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y.) makes an unannounced left turn into action with a slow-mo assassination attempt that looks like a commercial for something then proceeds as planned to the inevitable nuptial hour.

By Anthony Lane Penelope Cruz Nicole Kidman Daniel Day-Lewis and Kate Hudson in ""Nine.""   Credit Illustration by Andy Friedman The beginning of ""Nine"" feels like an end. The first words we hear are ""You kill your film"" uttered at a press conference by an Italian movie director named Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis). We then find him at the Cinecitta film studios in Rome on an echoing soundstage which starts to fill as if by magic with all the women he has known adored and worked with. They range from his mother (Sophia Loren) to his tigerish mistress (Penelope Cruz) his main muse (Nicole Kidman) and his long-suffering wife Luisa (Marion Cotillard). Also present are his costume designer and confidante (Judi Dench) a reporter from American Vogue (Kate Hudson) and from the shifting sands of his childhood a witchy hooker by the name of Saraghina (Fergie). Together they weave around Guido chanting ""La-la-la"" like a chorus without a song sheet. You wonder where the lyrics went but as the rest of ""Nine"" makes clear youre not missing much. Rob Marshalls film is based on the stage production of the same name and I cant say that I am racked with regret at having skipped it. There are big numbers aplenty--all the actresses get one apiece apart from Cotillard who gets two--and most of them are belted out with growls and gusto (Fergie being the belter-in-chief) but I woke up the next morning as I did after Marshalls previous choice of musical ""Chicago"" without a single tune or phrase still tolling in my head. ""My husband spins fantasies he lives them then gives them to you"" Luisa sings and her words might as well be spoken. You long for the ghost of Lorenz Hart to be unleashed on the whole affair with a hard blue pencil and a head full of rhymes. To be fair the theatrical project was a challenge in the first place having taken its cue from ""81/2"" Fellinis masterpiece of 1963. This means that ""Nine"" is a film of a musical of a film--which was itself the film of a life if you happen to believe that Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) was the harassed alter ego of Fellini himself. The story was that there was no story; Guido could not get his latest film started or even written and that remains the case in ""Nine."" One is forced to ask who wants to make or watch a major Hollywood musical about mental block? ""Singin in the Rain"" was also about obstacles in moviemaking but it found irrepressible joy in seeing them surmounted; each song pushed events along whereas the songs in ""Nine"" merely hold them up. A woman is introduced the action is paused and she gives us the melodious lowdown on her circumstances. Cruz for instance begins with the purring line ""Whos not wearing any clothes? Im not"" though she is in fact wearing about an acre of lingerie and sliding down a long pink slope a lubricious tribute to ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" from ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" although Cruz is hellbent on highlighting her rear whereas Marilyn Monroe was too busy stuffing her tongue in her cheek. The wisest figure by far is Judi Dench and its a pity that she is saddled with the most pointless song--a riff on the Folies-Bergere. Wrong country surely but then the movies grip on Italy feels tenuous at best. There are luscious locations and everyone will covet Guidos lithe little Alfa Romeo in powder blue but there is no getting around the ungainly fact that here is a bunch of non-Italian performers speaking like-a theess. (The script is by Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella whose 1999 film ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" about foreigners dying to be sucked into Italys warmth and only half succeeding was a far more honest approach to cultural fusion. Just think what Minghella might have wrought at the helm of ""Nine."") Apart from the odd pronto and bene the ban on Italian is absolute without one subtitle. Could this be because the filmmakers are scared that ""Nine"" will be mistaken for an art-house picture? If so their fear is well grounded because ""81/2"" remains the most gorgeous item of festive modernism with its portrait of the artist ensnared by the goddesses of memory and desire. The entire theme of Marshalls film is set by and surpassed by Fellinis opening scene--wordless and breathy with a trapped Mastroianni pounding on the windows of his hearse-black gridlocked car. To follow in the footsteps of Mastroianni is no enviable task and Daniel Day-Lewis adroit as ever approaches it by changing the steps. Where his predecessor lounged and strolled or dipped into a clownish stagger we find Day-Lewis leaner in physique forever on the fast and wolfish prowl--hands in pockets shoulders forward not pushing his sunglasses cutely up and down his nose as Mastroianni did but keeping them on full beam like the Devils headlights. He belongs however in a more focussed movie; this one feels too sluggish for his predations although we do get a loyal reproduction of the scene from ""81/2"" in which Guido watches footage of his latest screen tests with Luisa sitting nearby. She was once his leading lady and Marshall has supplied (as Fellini did not) a flashback to her own test years before with Guido unpinning her hair in front of the camera. Now he does exactly the same to a grateful ingenue and there is no forgetting the look in Cotillards eyes and their tears of simmering wrath. ""To create is to forgive yourself in public"" she says and the line is like a switchblade. She has seen as Fellini saw all too clearly and as ""Nine"" shows only in flickers that the Guidos of this world are drawn toward a helpless and horrifying deal love for arts sake. The beast is not made human by his beauties whether they number eight nine or hundreds; he just becomes more of a beast. The new Terry Gilliam film ""The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus"" has one of those roll-up roll-up titles that appeal to Gilliam who is not so much a movie director as a carnival barker with a bent for motion pictures. The last example was ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and some of its tropes return here the team of travelling players and the elderly fabulist who tries to dictate the proceedings. In this case our aging hero Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) is perched inside a mobile theatre of antiquated design which is trundled through modern London; part of the movies charm is its brazen anachronism--a sense that the past can seep through time and burst into the here and now. (And the now is pretty wretched rusting wastelands beside the Thames.) Also in attendance are Tom Waits as a smiling Beelzebub in a bowler hat; a dwarf sadly compulsory in any work that flirts with the surreal; and as Parnassuss daughter the British model Lily Cole whose unearthly heart of a face is like a special effect. Above all we get four types of Tony the gadabout who consorts with Parnassuss troupe. He is played by Johnny Depp Colin Farrell Jude Law and Heath Ledger the first three deputizing for the last who died before the films completion. It should not be mistaken for his finest hour; we see his larking but not the undertow of frailty that tugged at ""Brokeback Mountain"" and his principal duty here like everyone elses is to go with the flow of phantasmagoria. Thus people are invited onto the Doctors stage and sent through a rickety mirror into a world where anything goes--a candy-colored landscape out of ""Mary Poppins"" an oily river that curls up into a snakes head you name it. Are these embodiments of each persons fancy or did Parnassus himself cook them up? I have no idea any more than I can decide whether C.G.I. was the best or the worst thing that could have happened to Terry Gilliam. His gifts of invention were already so fecund and so prolix that this newfound ability to construct anything that drifts into his minds eye--as opposed to the ramshackle hand-drawn delight of his earlier animation--spells both enchantment and chaos. He can follow any train of thought so he does and its no surprise when the trains run out of steam. No such mania infects ""The Young Victoria"" Jean-Marc Vallees account of the monarchs early years which veers in the other direction. From the start it feels handsome steady and stuck; the ties that bind the historical bio-pic are no looser than those which constrain a royal personage and the frustration to which Victoria would later admit (""I had led a very unhappy life as a child--had no scope for my very violent feelings of affection"") is legible in the face of Emily Blunt who takes the title role. She is attended by a host of British actors--Paul Bettany though too young makes a winning and cynical Lord Melbourne and Jim Broadbent resembling a Gillray cartoon detonates the stolid tale with a loud and well-attested explosion of rage at a banquet--but the movie like the age that it depicts stands or falls on the woman at its core. Blunt strikes me as the real deal languid but biting like Jeanne Moreau yet able to command a scene while somehow appearing to shift to one side (as Moreau would never do) and observe with a skeptics smile. The little puff of relief that Victoria gives after addressing the Privy Council on the morning of her accession is despite her duties the exhalation of a free spirit and one prays that films more liberating than this and more likely to feed Blunts appetites will come her way. The Colin Firth of ""A Single Man"" likewise rises above the atmosphere that encircles him. He plays George who teaches literature at a college in Los Angeles in 1962 while mourning the loss of his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) in a car accident. When George walks through the snow toward the crash site not only are his pants perfectly creased but even the corpse preserves a certain je ne sais quoi. True this is a dream sequence but then the whole movie with its glazed and polished air could be a dream. We know for instance how English professors dress some trim-suited and clerical others avuncular in tweed many too deep in Dryden to be bothered with their outward crust and one or two no better than compost heaps. Not this lot. They look as spry and as spotless as an advertising spread in LUomo Vogue. Whos in charge here for heavens sake--a fashion designer? Well yes for ""A Single Man"" is the first feature to be directed by Tom Ford. The hero of the story adapted from the novel by Christopher Isherwood explains himself in voice-overs ""Just get through the goddamned day bit melodramatic perhaps but then again my heart has been broken. Feel as if Im drowning sinking cant breathe"" he says. Such wordiness seems unjust to Firth who is perfectly capable of showing any congestion of spirit by body language alone. The film is slowed by its own beauty but it is salvaged by two majestic scenes. In one George learns of Jims death in a phone call from a relative during which his voice (this being 1962) must betray nothing leaving his face (on which Ford is smart enough to keep the camera) to do all the work; in another George goes around for a long evening with his friend Charley (Julianne Moore) who likes to start boozing as she puts on her face in the morning. Two characters trying and failing to drown their hopes and regrets and two strong actors refusing to be tight-laced by a directors exercise in style here is a mood piece looking for a fight.

Blunt however is such a wily and playful actress that in The Young Victoria she makes her twinkly ivory radiance fit the role. Her beauty comes off not as the usual period eye candy but as an expression of Victorias inner grace -- her deceptive ability to go with the flow. As a teenager Victoria doesnt quite know why she wants to be queen but she does know she was born to shoulder that glorious burden. The morning that King William IV (Jim Broadbent) dies Blunt gazes into a mirror with a look of How will I do this? and that brief humanizing glance is enchanting. It makes her seem royally real. Written by Julian Fellowes the screenwriter of Gosford Park The Young Victoria traces its heroines early years by embracing a radical concept It sticks close to historical fact and thereby presents the choices faced by a naive young queen not as a confectionary costume melodrama but as the nuanced political passion play it well may have been. The most craven schemers -- Victorias mother (Miranda Richardson) and the consort (Mark Strong) shes ruled by -- are defeated without much fanfare. Victorias real problem is deciding which colleague to trust the unctuously affable Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who exploits her insecurities or her cousin Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) whom she falls in love with but whos essentially working as an undercover agent for his uncle the king of Belgium. At first Victoria trusts too much; then after marrying Albert she trusts too little. Shes an English-monarch Goldilocks trying to figure out how much manipulation is just right. The Young Victoria has a subtler flow than you might expect and at times its calmer than you may like. Director Jean-Marc Vallees images have a creamy stateliness but this is no gilded ? princess fantasy -- its the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant. Victoria a leader who changed the world becomes any young woman brave enough to seize her moment.

Anyone who complains they dont make love stories like they used to will get a kick out of ""The Young Victoria"" a biopic of the early years of Blightys longest-reigning queen and in particular her courtship with the love of her life Prince Albert. Tip-top casting and playing led by young thesps Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the royal lovebirds a succulently crisp script by Julian Fellowes (""Gosford Park"") and trim helming by French-Canadian Jean-Marc Vallee (""C.R.A.Z.Y."") combine in well-groomed upscale three-hankie entertainment for the ""Masterpiece Theater"" crowd. Pic bows in the U.K. March 6. A brief intro with Victoria as an 11-year-old (Michaela Brooks) sets her up as a victim of her position caught between the machinations of two royal uncles and a prisoner of protocol and social rules. But thanks to Blunts beautifully modulated turn which balances royal reserve girlish enthusiasm and lightly tempered steel the film is in no way a morbid study in self-pity. The biggest compliment one can pay Blunt is that the more familiar Queen Victoria of later life can already be glimpsed in her perf without ever getting in the way of her youthful portrait. Story proper begins in 1837 just before the 18th birthday of Princess Victoria of Kent (Blunt) who in the absence of any other heirs of King William (Jim Broadbent hilariously ornery) is next in line to the throne. However so far Victoria has been kept away from the court by her domineering mother the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her moms ambitious adviser Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). If the sickly William soon kicks the bucket and mom and Conroy can get the still underage Victoria to sign a regency order the duchess will be able to rule in her name and Conroy can rule through the duchess. Victoria holds out against their bullying but across the Channel her uncle Belgian King Leopold (Thomas Kretschmann) is plotting to get his nephew Albert (Friend) to marry Victoria for political convenience. Albert is coached in Victorias likes and dislikes but when the two finally meet Victoria takes a fancy to him when he drops his act. Blunt and Friend quickly establish the screen chemistry vital to the movies success in a delicious scene in which the two play chess under the watchful eyes of their scheming elders. The complicity they develop forms the basis for a long-distance courtship that slowly ripens into love. However after becoming queen at the age of 18 Victoria still feels unready to commit to marriage before establishing her own authority. Artfully manipulated by pol Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) she finally gives in to her own heart and Alberts patient courting and the two who are only months apart in age finally marry three years later in 1840. The lead-up to the proposal of marriage is played as a romantic-political triangle between Victoria Albert and Melbourne. Blunts controlled portrayal of the young womans fractionally different attitudes to the two main men in her life is one of the pics major delights. When she finally reveals her true feelings at the movies 70-minute mark the remainder of the film sketching her and Alberts first years of marriage movingly surfs on the tide of emotions unleashed. Fellowes screenplay packs in a host of characters and some background politics such as Victorias edgy relationship with Tory prime minister Sir Robert Peel (Michael Maloney) in a series of brief pithily dialogued sequences. What could have been a bumpy dramatic ride -- and is in the early stages -- is gradually smoothed into longer more satisfying arcs by Vallees fluid direction smooth cutting by Jill Bilcock and Matt Garner and especially by Ilan Eshkeris copious score. Latter lacks any strong musical motifs but its classical vamp-til-ready style lends both dignity and romance to the material. Its Blunts show but both Friend who bears an uncanny resemblance to the real Albert and Bettany playing way older than he is are almost equal partners. Both their characters nicely modulate as the movie progresses with Bettanys Melbourne becoming almost sympathetic. Supports are solid down the line with both Richardsons mom and Harriet Walters aunt the main standouts. Both thesps like Friend sport realistic German accents emphasizing how many of the senior royals of the time were in fact Teutons. Realism doesnt quite extend however to Blunts accent which is pure British cut-glass even though Victorias first language was German and she never quite mastered English grammar. Other tech credits are all top of the line from Sandy Powells quietly eye-catching costumes to the candle-lit Super-35 widescreen lensing by German d.p. Hagen Bogdanski (""The Lives of Others"").

Susu says January 3 2015 at 410 pm Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years) Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was apart from our current Queen the oldest ever British monarch living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in ""Mrs Brown"". ""The Young Victoria"" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal Sarah Duchess of York whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra. There are three main strands to the plot. The first concerns the intrigues of Victorias mother the Duchess of Kent a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy who was widely rumoured to be her lover. (According to one unfounded rumour he and not the late Duke of Kent was Victorias natural father). The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium who was uncle to both of them to influence this romance. (Leopolds hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg to which both he and Albert belonged). The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839 when supporters of the Tory Party (which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government with the monarch reduced to a figurehead. Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories the predecessors of the modern Conservative party. Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified whereas Melbourne for all his dash and charm is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform. There may be some truth is these characterisations but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs and that they had benefited from William IVs unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration. Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen and this one contains its share of inaccuracies. Prince Albert for example was not injured in Edward Oxfords attempt on Victorias life and Melbourne (in his late fifties at the time of Victorias accession) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany. King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent (who was his sister-in-law) but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet as he is shown doing here. I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a ""Regency Order""; the Duchesss constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830 which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession. No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act. There are also occasional infelicities. In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a ""Danger Major cliche ahead"" warning. Yet in spite of scenes like this I came to enjoy the film. There were some good performances especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy. It is visually very attractive being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama. Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top. (Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in ""Moulin Rouge""). The main reason for the films success however is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert. Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused but a determined strong-minded and loving young woman. Her love for Albert and their happy family life together was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people. (With the exception of George III Victorias Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues). Blunt and Friend make ""The Young Victoria"" a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history.
