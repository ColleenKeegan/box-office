Some fancy footwork in the writing and directing cant disguise the hoary ""Ten Little Indians"" origins of ""Identity."" A snappily executed little thriller set entirely at a remote desert motel in which the body count of occupants is tallied via a quickly accumulating set of room keys this glorified programmer keeps the viewer guessing about the killer for a while but features a twist ending that will be as painfully obvious to some as it will be a complete surprise to others. A smart campaign looks to generate good short-term biz for Sony. Scouring about for a fresh ""Old Dark House""-style location in which to trap a set of seemingly unrelated characters British scribe Michael Cooney (the ""Jack Frost"" pics and the West End stage hit ""Cash on Delivery"") has come up with a good one in a Bates-like establishment in the Nevada wastes that becomes inescapable due to torrential rains. From first frame to last the water pounds down cutting off the roads and phones (cell phones dont work well around here either) and creating a sense of unrelieved pressure on the hapless characters who skulk around like a pack of wet dogs trying to evade a relentless predator in their midst. In a framing device the import of which is long kept mysterious the case of multiple murderer Malcolm Rivers (Pruitt Taylor Vince) is brought up for a new hearing just hours before his scheduled execution. Cut to the motel where a distraught George (John C. McGinley) turns up on a rainy night carrying the bloody body of his wife Alice (Leila Kenzle) their dazed son Timmy (Bret Loehr) in tow. Jazzing up the calcified format any way they can Cooney and director James Mangold play little games with the time sequence. Liked practiced card dealers they rapidly shuffle events to show how cop-turned-chauffeur Ed (John Cusack) driving over-the-hill prima donna actress Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca DeMornay) home from a film shoot she just quit accidentally ran over Alice then helped to save her life and get her to the nearest shelter; how low-rent hooker Paris (Amanda Peet) abandoned her convertible and caught a ride with Ed who later ditched his own car and returned to the motel with bottom-feeder newlyweds Ginny and Lou (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott); and how tough cop Rhodes (Ray Liotta) was forced into an unwelcome pit stop while transporting demented murderer Robert Maine (Jake Busey). Once the first victims head is discovered knocking around in an industrial clothes dryer a half-hour in the corpses begin piling up rapidly. When Rhodes foolishly allows his prisoner to escape suspicion instantly falls upon Maine but when the latter is found with a baseball bat down his throat and the pace of the killings accelerates thereafter panic and dread compete as prevailing emotions among those left alive. The pressure cooker environment and the on-edge if not edgy characters keep things lively for a while but the familiarity of the concept and essential thinness of the conceit show through well before the brief running time expires. While the key revelation is kind of creepy not only does it lack the shock value that might have been intended but it seems increasingly implausible the more you think about it cheapening the piece considerably in retrospect. Working with uniformly one-dimensional parts performers do their bit to contribute some flavor. In a rare conventional project Cusack steers clear of stock heroics by underplaying Eds competence and essential smarts while Liotta registers only minor variations on notes hes hit before. A welcome live-wire whenever shes on Peet seems all but bursting to play a multi-faceted character for a change and McGinley is now looking more like Rudy Giuliani than James Woods does. Everyone else alternates between distraught and jumpy. Atmospheric pic has the feel of a stylistic exercise for Mangold who has shown a leaning toward character-driven dramas in the past and he handles it proficiently with key help from lenser Phedon Papamichael and editor David Brenner both of whom do exemplary work. Mark Friedbergs motel set shows no telltale signs of its studio confines and Alan Silvestris score busily tends to keeping the tension up.

But initial admiration soon fades into a feeling of emptiness. Michael Cooneys bustling screenplay is obviously inspired by Agatha Christies Ten Little Indians as disparate travellers converge at a remote motel on a stormy night only to find their number whittled away one by one. Among the increasingly fearful flotsam limo driver Cusack fugitive call girl Peet and hassled cop Liotta seem likely to survive longest in the face of the escalating body count. There are things to enjoy. Cusack is all nuts and bolts professionalism as he delivers screeds of deftly disguised exposition. Spirited direction milks the isolated tumbledown setting for copper-bottomed suspense and almost masks the mechanical aspect of one inventively grisly demise following another. The scheming narrative ably marshals teasing red herrings and diversionary ruses before hitting us with a doozy of a reversal. But thats it. Plenty of craft and care yet somehow getting the trick out in the open drains the film of the fun we had in the run-up.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Starring John Cusack Ray Liotta Amanda Peet and John Hawkes. Directed by James Mangold. (VHS and DVD. R. 97 minutes.) At first ""Identity"" seems like nothing more than a pleasing and blatant homage (i.e. rip-off) to the Agatha Christie-style thriller where marooned guests realize that a murderer is in their midst . . . and no one can leave The rain is unceasing. Cars dont start phones dont work doors creak gates swing open by themselves -- weve seen it before. Yet make no mistake. ""Identity"" is more than an entertaining thriller. Its a highly original one. The violence and mayhem are constant though the movies style is refreshingly old-fashioned -- scream-and-laughter-inducing rather than coldly repulsive in the modern fashion. The retro style is a conscious choice not a crutch because at heart ""Identity"" is postmodern creative and quite new. Exactly how it manages to be new wont even be hinted at here. Suffice it to say that at the screening I saw the print broke and there was an unscheduled 10-minute intermission. In the rush for the concessions counter everyone was sure they knew who did it and absolutely everyone was wrong. ""Identity"" takes place almost entirely in a single location a run-down motel in Nevada. The roads are flooded on either side so motorists have no choice but to check in for the evening. Checking out will be harder. John Cusack plays Ed a former Los Angeles cop who works as the chauffeur for a spoiled has-been actress (Rebecca De Mornay). Ray Liotta is Rhodes a cop who is transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey). Also in for a rough night are Amanda Peet as a reformed call girl and a young married couple (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott) just back from Vegas. A clever opening juggles the sequence of events to account for the whereabouts of the various characters at a given point in time. Then the catastrophes begin -- first a terrible road accident that causes a family (John C. McGinley Leila Kenzle Bret Loehr) to come to the motel seeking first aid. Soon the head of one of the guests sans body is found revolving in a clothes dryer (an unorthodox but effective means of drying hair). At that point one can say that the prologue is over and that ""Identity"" has officially begun. Someone is killing the guests one by one. A prime suspect of course is the prisoner if only because he looks like Gary Busey -- his son Jakes gleaming and perfectly evil teeth are the Busey family crest and make a screen credit unnecessary. But no one really knows whos doing it or why and despite the efforts of the two cops (current and former) the stiffs keep coming. Figure 10 guests a 97-minute movie. ""Identity"" is at no loss for action. Though the film is without doubt an ensemble piece its Cusacks movie if its anybodys. The faint look of permanent and slightly comic shock that once defined his face has mellowed into a richer sadder harder humanity. Liotta is just as terrific. Like a ferocious Baby Huey he cajoles bullies and terrorizes his way through the movie. And Peet with her long jaw and angular dark beauty does a fetching turn as the party girl dreaming of a little peace. ""Identity"" doesnt aspire to be a classic. It aspires to grab the audience and say ""Gotcha"" but few movies can even do that. Advisory This film contains violence and strong language.

The ""party"" call went out to college students for an all-expenses-paid spring break vacation at a beachfront resort in Cancun. The only requirements a hard body a soft head and exhibitionist tendencies. Heidi and Dave scope out the beach scene in The Real Cancun a reality-based study of spring break. Cancun features dozens of scantily clad and uninhibited folks inane conversation binge drinking and transparent posturing. Those who expect lots of nudity will see plenty of suggestive dancing and lascivious poses but only a few bare breasts bums and sex acts kept under wraps (or sheets). Viewers will zero in quickly on the most obnoxious of the pack. Jeremy the blond stud brags ""Girls go on spring break to meet guys like me"" and beds a few of them. Nicole and Roxanne the Texan twins put on a beachfront show that would make Showgirls Elizabeth Berkley blush. Then theres Alan the shy guy who prefers milk to shots of tequila. The rest of the crowd induces him to drink and he spends much of the trip drunk. His favorite refrain ""I just wanna see some boobies."" Those who sit through this mindlessness get the booby prize. --Claudia Puig It Runs in the Family The title easily could refer to the acting talent of the Douglas clan. Father and son Kirk and Michael Douglas moments together are among the movies best. Michaels 24-year-old son Cameron and Michaels mother (Kirks ex) Diana also put in strong performances making the overall experience worthwhile though the story is predictable. The comedy-drama initially might appear to be based on real-life elements but its fictional. The movie opens with shots of old photos a reminder of 86-year-old Kirk Douglas glory days. The character he plays attorney Mitchell Gromberg has had a stroke just as Douglas has. Though the actors speech is slurred it is always understandable. Alex is experiencing a midlife crisis and his son Asher (Cameron) is having his own rebellious period. Alex is married to Rebecca (Bernadette Peters) a psychologist trying to understand the quiet ways of their 11-year-old son Eli (Rory Culkin) who in a way is the most mature male in the family. Michael Douglas does a credible job as the petulant son who nearly strays from his wife and is inattentive to his children but still emerges as a likable sort. A noteworthy scene in which father and son stage a relatives ""burial at sea"" in an upscale suburb is a hoot. But a few other moments most of them involving Cameron and his love interest (Michelle Monaghan) feel like a cliched WB sitcom. Mark Hammer an amputee does an excellent job as Alexs elderly uncle. His performance and that of Kirk Douglas powerfully illustrate the indomitable spirit of individuals who refuse to let disabilities impede their goals. For that alone the movie is worth watching. (PG-13 drug content sexual material language) --C. P. Identity There are a couple of identity crises brewing in the psychological thriller Identity. Someone is killing off 10 strangers stranded together in a remote motel during a violent storm. And identifying the murderer is what the movie purports to be about. But halfway through the killer is revealed and suspense dwindles as the movie morphs into a psychodrama about the workings of a deranged mind and the efficacy of the insanity defense. Reviews of the movies Real Cancun (out of four) It Runs in the Family Identity Confidence People I Know Ostensibly inspired by Agatha Christies Ten Little Indians Identity relies excessively on its lineage a conceit that has become fairly tired. John Cusack is convincing as a decent but enigmatic limo driver ferrying a spoiled TV star (Rebecca De Mornay). When they have an accident on a deserted road that injures the mother of a small child (Leila Kenzle) Cusack and the womans husband (John C. McGinley) seek assistance at the only open establishment a seedy motel run by a suspicious night manager (John Hawkes). Soon a storm forces others to converge on the place a call girl (Amanda Peet) a cop (Ray Liotta) transporting a prisoner (Jake Busey) and a pair of newlyweds (Clea DuVall and William Lee Scott.) With moments of mind-bending creepiness the film has potential but eventually it devolves into merely a head-scratcher. (R strong violence and language.) --C. P. Confidence Director James Foleys slick handsome package isnt about that feeling you get when you hit a karaoke high-note or a softball at a picnic. Its about the other kind of confidence grifting cheating the rackets sleights-of-hand and the built-in victim -- who in this case ends up dead. Unfortunately the corpse turns out to have worked for a lowlife Mr. Big which means that the offending crew members (Edward Burns Paul Giamatti) must visit the boss to make amends. They find an outwardly seedy but subliminally scary string-puller played by Dustin Hoffman. Hoffmans colorfully ill-groomed creep suggests what Midnight Cowboys Ratso Rizzo might have become if hed had more money but less character. Hoffman wants his visitors to rip off an even bigger Big (Robert Forster) setting off 75 more minutes of did-I-just-see-that? for audiences. Even with Burns smoothest performance yet as a lead Confidence is on a level with Steven Soderberghs blah remake of Oceans Eleven. But because no one is expecting much it seems a little better. Movies can pull off sleights-of-hand too. (R language violence and sexuality/nudity) --Mike Clark People I Know As a Manhattan transplant suddenly in over his head fading publicist Al Pacino wont own a cell phone and keeps referring to ""the old days"" when he represented Montgomery Clift and Mama Cass in the showbiz jungle. Filmed two years ago this sometimes incisive but finally overbaked drama deals with murder intrigue and an unnamed mayor whos a hot-button issue for minorities. In reaction Pacino (wisely underplaying a showy part) sponsors a benefit for jailed Nigerian immigrants without green cards. While trying to get celebrities to show up (""I have Regis"" is dangled bait) hes tangentially involved in the killing of a druggie starlet. Victim Tea Leoni memorably spits out put-downs and the movie loses something with her exit. Kim Basinger has a few scenes as a gorgeous widow who wants Pacino to give it all up for her Virginia farm. It wont be a waste of time to watch these people -- on cable and probably not too far in the future. (In New York and Los Angeles. R language drug use sexual images) --M. C.
