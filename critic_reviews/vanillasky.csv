Mysterious tale of a dashingly handsome young man who is badly disfigured in an auto accident. This review was corrected on December 12 2001 A middling Tom Cruise vehicle as far as the general public is concerned ""Vanilla Sky"" will surprise buffs for being a virtual scene-by-scene remake of the 1997 Spanish feature ""Open Your Eyes"" (Abre los ojos) albeit with a distinctly different tone. Mysterious tale of a dashingly handsome young man who is badly disfigured in an auto accident sails along for a while thanks to the intriguing setup and energetic attractive cast. But like the original -- only at considerably greater length -- it ultimately heads into an elaborate mumbo-jumbo zone that strenuously plays head trips over familiar issues of reality vs. fantasy whos who and what characters are alive or dead. With Cruise alone being used to sell the picture in a campaign that offers not the slightest hint of what the film is like or about Paramount can expect strong initial B.O. to level off to ultimate midrange results based on likely heavily mixed aud reactions. Strikingly well made even as it became frustratingly muddled toward the end ""Open Your Eyes"" opened the floodgates in a remarkable way for its director and co-writer Alejandro Amenabar; based on Cruise and Nicole Kidmans enthusiasm for it the young Spanish helmer sold the remake rights to Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner and snared Kidman to star in his next picture ""The Others"" the sleeper hit of this past summer. Oddly Cameron Crowe Cruises cohort on the massively successful ""Jerry Maguire"" became involved to adapt and direct the ""Eyes"" remake Oddly in that Crowes renown is based first and foremost on his talents as an original screenwriter. Perhaps realizing that to begin reshuffling Amenabars complicated structure would bring down the whole deck of cards Crowe scarcely touched it changing only minor details retaining important key dialogue and making his most significant contribution by moving the mood away from dark weirdness to one drenched in modern mores and rock n roll. Plotwise if youve seen ""Open Your Eyes"" youve seen ""Vanilla Sky."" In kinetic narcissistic high gear Cruise convincingly plays David Aames a devil-may-care New Yorker who has inherited a fortune and a publishing empire to which he pays cursory attention can barely walk across a room without stumbling over all the women who prostrate themselves at his feet and relishes the idea of commitment about as much as he enjoys heights his one phobia. As did the original pic opens with Penelope Cruz intoning the words ""abre los ojos"" then indicates there will be two levels of ""reality"" at work as David emerges one morning to find Manhattan utterly devoid of life then pic rewinds to have him make the same drive through a city full of the usual activity. In a sudden flash-forward shortly thereafter David his face now hidden behind a mask is seen under the care of therapist McCabe (Kurt Russell) who reveals that David has been charged with murder. Although David pointedly did not invite occasional bed partner Julie (Cameron Diaz) to his birthday party she turns up anyway at the festivities populated by dozens of great looking women as well as in a cameo Steven Spielberg. The hosts best friend Brian (Jason Lee) brings along another looker Sofia (Cruz playing the same role she essayed in the original) whom David playfully enlists to help keep Julie at bay and later takes home. In a paroxysm of unrequited love Julie then manages to get David in her car and promptly drives the two of them off a bridge. A few months and operations later the previously beautiful David emerges with a badly scarred and somewhat distorted face and dreams that it can be reconstructed back to normal. He resumes pursuing Sofia who remains friendly but at arms length and he eventually flips out casting his mask off in a drunken nightclub frenzy and passing out on a downtown street. Suddenly all is normal again Davids face is perfect and Sofia takes him to bed until its abruptly Julie in his bed claiming to be Sofia and taking her place even in the latters personal photographs. During an intense sex bout David becomes unhinged and would appear to kill Sofia/Julie is declared deranged by McCabe and eventually ends up in the offices of a creepy company that specializes in cryonization or putting people in the deep freeze until some distant date when they will be thawed and brought back to life. ""Open Your Eyes"" had a similarly mystifying final act that ultimately proved needlessly obscure and Crowe has gone to some lengths to try to explain what happens so the audience wont go out totally flummoxed. Nonetheless the temptation to tune out of whats going on is too great to resist especially since some of the more arresting aspects of the original have been softened along the way moves that make ""Vanilla Sky"" like its title more bland and less provocative. Unsurprisingly the lead characters facial deformity has been made much less grotesque in the Hollywood version. In the Spanish film his post-accident face made him resemble the Elephant Mans brother and quite difficult to look at; Cruise by contrast is allowed to look banged up but not utterly unsightly. More significantly however the character of Julie has been made so nice that her actions no longer make sense. In the original the character was a weird one-night-stand who became a scary stalker a screws-loose witch who seemed entirely capable of doing herself in and taking the rich young man with her. Here Diaz plays her as a sort of lovable kook whos just terribly disappointed that one of Gothams most eligible bachelors has escaped her grasp; as written and played her willingness to end it all (which itself is fudged in the staging) is simply unconvincing. Not only unbelievable but annoying as well are the cultural artifacts with which Crowe has surrounded David. There is nothing in the mans character to explain why hed be interested in the giant French ""Jules and Jim"" and ""Breathless"" posters that prominently adorn his apartment. And while David does seem like a rock n roll kind of guy -- not unlike a grown-up version of Cruises character in ""Risky Business"" in fact -- the fetishism here goes so far that it begins to reflect what we know of Crowe much more than it illuminates anything about David. Crowe made it abundantly clear in ""Almost Famous"" how much he loves music but the 40-plus pop tunes that wallpaper the picture (in overly familiar fashion at times) plus the John Coltrane hologram ""playing"" at his party the genuflection in front of a framed busted-up Pete Townshend guitar and the irrelevant homages to Dylan and Bjork just for starters seem like an obsession being pursued to vastly diminishing returns. Theres a time and place for everything but enough already. That said the picture has vitality a fine cast and excellent craft. Playing a callow fellow whose fate pushes him to varied emotional extremes Cruise is switched on at all times and quite credible as a superficial guy sincerely trying to go deep. Cruz who has never seemed comfortable acting in English at least comes across as more at ease here than in any of her previous Hollywood efforts although she doesnt glow with the great radiance and inviting warmth she emitted in ""Open Your Eyes."" Lee as Davids easygoing novelist buddy Timothy Spall as Davids intensely loyal attorney Tilda Swinton as the supremely assured head of the cryonics firm and Noah Taylor as a strange company spokesman who explains all bring strength and distinction to the supporting cast. Production values are rich in all departments notably Catherine Hardwickes production design which is especially fine in its detailing of Davids lavish apartment and John Tolls lustrous lensing. Final scene set on the roof of a midtown skyscraper not only extensively shows the late World Trade Center towers looming downtown but the Statue of Liberty sitting smack-dab in the Hudson River.

His interest in sexy Julie (Cameron Diaz) evaporates as soon as he spots his best friends (Jason Lee) date Sophia (Penelope Cruz) whom he pursues without a thought for the consequences of his actions.Briefly the movie appears to be a romantic comic portrait of a self-satisfied jerk. Then suddenly it flashes forward to a prison where David his handsome face hidden behind a latex mask is being grilled by a psychologist (Kurt Russell). It seems his face has been disfigured in a car wreck when the jealous suicidal Julie drove both of them off a bridge. It also seems that David is facing murder charges. But who is the victim?Just when we think were watching a murder mystery the movies reality shifts under our feet again. Are we watching a dream a nightmare a madmans delusions? Treading a fine line between horror and hooey ""Vanilla Sky"" is part thriller part love story part science fiction and entirely different from anything the amiable creator of ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"" has done before. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Unlike David Lynchs mesmerizing surreal ""Mulholland Falls"" everything gets explained at the end. You wont see the final nutty twist coming--that is unless youve seen Alejandro Amenabars ""Open Your Eyes"" the spooky Spanish film that Crowe duplicates with shocking fidelity down to the casting of Cruz as Sophia. ""Vanilla Sky"" alas held no shocks or surprises for me having recently seen the original. One change he does make is to humanize the Cameron Diaz character who was a scary femme fatale in Amenabars version. This is consistent with Crowes kinder gentler sensibility but its a mistake. Not only does it make her radical act harder to believe it lessens the tales terror.The real mystery here is why a filmmaker as talented and unique as Crowe would want to devote several years of his life to recreating someone elses movie.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Whatever goes wrong in Cameron Crowes Vanilla Sky though (and not a lot goes right) the film does at least have the courage to ask the question What are you left with when you take away Tom Cruises face? The answer Im afraid is Not very much. Cruise has always been at his worst when he has to express the inner anguish of his being. In Vanilla Sky the cataclysmic car crash that leaves his smug-grinned yuppie peacock (this time hes a Maxim-style magazine publisher) scarred and embittered is meant to be a cosmic comeuppance for his life of selfish hedonism. But the sight of Cruise looking like Jerry Maguire playing the Phantom of the Opera is creepy in all the wrong ways. Instead of provoking sympathy the ugly-duckling nightmare only heightens our awareness of Cruises vanity. Not to worry though--its all just a dream Or maybe not. Its my job to parse the inconsistencies of even the most confusing movies but halfway through Vanilla Sky there wasnt much I could do but throw up my hands. Are Cameron Diaz as Cruises threateningly unstable casual-sex buddy and Penelope Cruz as the saintly photographer who tries to Show Him Love supposed to be the same person? The way that the film has been edited none of the fake-outs and reversals have any weight; the more that they pile up the less we hold on to any of them. Were left with a cracked hall of mirrors taped together by a What is reality? cryogenics plot and scored to Cameron Crowes record collection. The movie does feature a few arresting visual tricks. Crowes eyes are open all right but he appears to have directed most of Vanilla Sky with his mind wide shut. D+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

USATODAY.com - Sky aims high but falls short Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 12/14/2001 - Updated 0150 PM ET Sky aims high but falls short By Mike Clark USA TODAY Vanilla Sky (out of four) Stars Tom Cruise Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Director Cameron Crowe Distributor Paramount Rating R for sexuality and strong language The usually down-to-earth Cameron Crowe has spent years building audience goodwill with such films as Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire. Now hes going to test it with Vanilla Sky a nervy and gorgeously mounted career stretch gone haywire starring Maguire lead Tom Cruise. The vibes never felt right on this one. Despite a New York setting and a Crowe-characteristic rock sensibility Vanilla is remarkably faithful to the plot of its source (Spains 1997 Open Your Eyes) which shared the same female lead Penelope Cruz. Those who know the original -- hardly the Cruise fan base -- probably sensed risky business for him long ago. Thats because Eyes creator Alejandro Amenabar (who directed Nicole Kidman in The Others) disfigured his central character and turned him into a noisy nut case after a lovers brutal act of revenge. Read more Video Vanilla Sky trailer Dazzling in parts but rough going as a whole writer/director Crowes variation is of all things tedious (a first for him) especially in early scenes. Veering close to discomforting self-parody as a has-it-all magazine magnate Cruise fails to click with his role from the start -- and even in later scenes when the idea of a cover-boy actor sporting a wrecked face would seem to have dramatic possibilities. Cruise also fails to click with Cameron Diaz as a fatal attraction whose character is tough to buy -- and with Cruz despite their off-screen relationship. Scenes in a boardroom and at a party should play to Crowes talents; instead they fall flat. Drawn-out encounters between lawyer Kurt Russell and a masked Cruise swell the running time to 136 minutes. Yet when Crowe can get away from the characters and into the surreality of discos dream sequences and an ethereal finale that finally gives the story some emotion this folly rises to the level of honorable even fleetingly brilliant. Through it all Oscar-winner John Toll continues on the path that has established him as the most exciting cinematographer working today. The movies built-in problem is severe enough to lick a Cruise a Cruz and Camerons of both sexes. What works in a quirky foreign film can look silly with expansive Hollywood treatment. Crowe is smart enough to know this so its baffling he chose Vanilla over richer cinematic tastes.

Starring Tom Cruise Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz. Directed and written by Cameron Crowe. (VHS and DVD. R. 136 minutes.) In ""Vanilla Sky"" Tom Cruise plays David Aames a man of charm enormous wealth and a libido so prolific that he can satisfy women four times in one night. The heir to a publishing fortune David emerges from protracted adolescence when he meets Sofia a Spanish dancer played by Penelope Cruz. But fate has a way of interrupting the bliss. ""Vanilla Sky"" is an odd mixture of science fiction romance and reality warp and will probably be compared to ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Memento"" for its ability to confound its audience. Its a big challenge for Cruise and writer- director Cameron Crowe but the films aim -- to dazzle and inspire -- is sapped by Cruises vein-popping running-the-marathon performance. When Cruise acts nothing is suggested and everything is indicated. A line of dialogue is prefaced with a knowing nod and a twinkle (hes sure of himself) a twist of the neck and narrowing of eyes (he knows youre full of it) or a drop of the jaw and parting of lips (hes surprised). Just as David finds ecstatic love his world is shattered when Julie (Cameron Diaz) a crazed and jealous ex-lover drives her car off an embankment and smashes it into a brick wall. Julie dies; Davids face is disfigured. Well maybe thats what happens. In a plotline that spins between reality and dreams and keeps adding and removing new layers of seeing were never sure whats happening and whats merely imagined in Davids fragile paranoid brain. ""Vanilla Sky"" has a large agenda and makes the mistake of assuming that well extend our unconditional sympathy to a character as narcissistic as privileged and as pleased with himself as David Aames. Cruz repeats the role that she played opposite Eduardo Noriega in ""Abre los Ojos."" Shes a hugely appealing actress and projects a plushy warmth and defenselessness. Most impressive is Cameron Diaz whose fatal-attraction stalker is both heartbreaking and terrifying. Advisory This movie contains raw language and sexual situations.

Starring Tom Cruise Penelope Cruz Cameron Diaz Jason Lee and Kurt Russell this film is a remake of the Spanish movie ""Abre Los Ojos"" (""Open Your Eyes"" 1997) directed and co-written by Alejandro Amenabar. This romantic drama-turned-science fiction flick is an abrupt departure in material for both Crowe (""Jerry Maguire"" 1996; ""Almost Famous"" 2000) and Cruise. Whether audiences are going to want to make the same trip is debatable. Cruise stars as David Aames a man who has everything. He glides through his manicured life without a trouble in sight. Hes the heir to a publishing empire created by his late father. The only checkpoints in his life are the companys seven-member board which he calls the Seven Dwarfs. As the only responsibility in his life theyre the only bane of his existence. On the other hand he hasnt formed many lasting relationships. His only friend is Brian Shelby (Lee) a would-be author whos known him since childhood. Shelby is the only one who will forgive Davids self-absorption. All the women in Davids life come and go and are as disposable as Kleenex.

"Vanilla Sky | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; vanilla-sky ) Vanilla Sky (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Vanilla Sky (the name refers to a painting by Monet) is the quirkily titled American remake of the 1997 Spanish language feature Open Your Eyes. Like its predecessor Vanilla Sky is a mind-bending excursion across genres - a warped fairy tale that dabbles in romance mythology horror mystery and science fiction. There are plenty of philosophical musings on the difference between dreams and reality and numerous occasions in which the film dares us to tell them apart. Vanilla Sky gives new meaning to the familiar phrase from a childrens song ""Life is but a dream."" For director Cameron Crowe the man behind Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous Vanilla Sky represents a groundbreaking career move. Not only is this his initial foray into the much-maligned realm of remakes but its the first time he has performed without the safety net of being firmly rooted in pop culture elements. Crowe shows immense respect for his source material but not the kind of slavish reverence lavished upon the book-to-movie conversion of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. Vanilla Sky is a faithful remake of Alejandro Amenabars Open Your Eyes but like all good remakes it can stand on its own and does not fade and discolor in the face of the original. Crowe has brought his own unique strengths to bear upon the material staying very much in step with Open Your Eyes while adding some warmth and clarity that were not evident in the cooler more ambiguous original. The Spanish-language film is the better version but Vanilla Sky is a credible substitute for subtitle-phobic audiences. David Aames (Tom Cruise) has the world in the palm of his hand. The majority stock owner of a big-time publishing firm David has everything he wants - a great job with short hours a spectacular Manhattan pad and a gorgeous female pal named Julie (Cameron Diaz) whos willing to have sex with him whenever the urge hits (which seems to be fairly often). Then one day confirmed bachelor David meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and he suddenly discovers what love is. Unfortunately Davids blossoming relationship with Sofia fans Julies jealousy. It seems that she doesnt share Davids casual view of their sexual encounters. So feeling hurt and betrayed she invites David for a ride then crashes her car killing herself and badly injuring him. He survives but is maimed and disfigured and must wear a mask to hide the mass of scars and twisted flesh that comprises his once-handsome face. (With the mask on he looks uncannily like Michael Myers the psycho killer of the Halloween series.) In many ways the story is pure Twilight Zone but Crowes down-to-earth approach softens and grounds it making the characters seem more genuine even amidst the surreal setting. Crowes use of music (one of the strengths of his previous efforts) - everything from the Beach Boys to Peter Gabriels ""Solsbury Hill"" - enhances the mood allowing Vanilla Sky to develop its own identity. In addition the screenplay closes with a less evasive explanation of what has transpired. However the changes are minor; this is not a case in which Hollywood has butchered the end of a foreign feature in the hope of boosting ticket sales. Several of the principals are veterans of Crowes behind-the-camera approach. Tom Cruise previously in Jerry Maguire brings along his boyish good looks. He plays David as a charismatic rogue - someone the audience is supposed to recognize as a bit of a scoundrel but like nevertheless. Jason Lee seen as the Stillwater lead singer in Almost Famous is Davids best friend Brian. Noah Taylor Stillwaters manager plays the part of a mysterious stranger who frequently crosses Davids path. Penelope Cruz reprising the part of Sofia (which she also played in Open Your Eyes) displays a fair amount of chemistry with Cruise. Crowe was reportedly delighted that he was able to capture the two falling in love on camera. However while theres definitely a spark it doesnt seem any more potent than the one between Cruise and Renee Zellweger in Jerry Maguire and there was nothing going on between them off-screen. Cameron Diaz has no difficulty with a difficult part - not only must she portray the playful girlfriend and the demented rejected lover but she has to mimic Cruz during two key sequences. Finally Kurt Russell plays the psychologist who befriends David and tries to help him unravel the mystery that makes him doubt his sanity. Like Open Your Eyes Vanilla Sky makes allusions to Beauty and the Beast The Hunchback of Notre Dame Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Phantom of the Opera. Crowe takes things one step further incorporating references to music film and art. The movie poses questions about the boundary between reality and fantasy. Like David the viewer sometimes has trouble differentiating one from the other. Crowe starts blurring this line early in the proceedings - the first scene offers the nightmarish tableau of David running through an entirely deserted Times Square (the logistics of filming this must have been enormous). In this era of virtual reality we are asked to examine our own preferences - to continue facing the tribulations of a concrete life or to retreat into an artificial dreamscape. In the end Vanilla Sky answers all the questions it poses and wraps up most (if not all) of the dangling plot threads. However while the explanations come in the final fifteen minutes the most rewarding aspect of the film is the journey to that point - trying to outguess the script enjoying the carefully constructed romance between David and Sofia (is anyone better than Crowe at telling a heartfelt love story?) and appreciating the details and nuances contributed by a director who knows what hes doing. The science fiction aspects of this movie may place Crowe in unfamiliar territory (he is clearly at his best when dealing with character interaction) but he rarely seems lost.
