Comments Like Mike In this summer-weight but winsome basketball fantasy a 14-year-old boy (rapper Lil Bow Wow) who longs to leave his Dickensian orphanage finds a pair of sneakers with the initials MJ inside. When he puts them on he acquires the slam-dunk prowess of a certain legend which in one fairy-tale twist after another propels him and his losing team into the playoffs. The script by Michael Elliot and Jordan Moffet is serviceable; the direction by John Schultz is clockwork though punchy. Yet the film made with the NBAs stamp of approval rides high on its old-fashioned sentiments and the precocious charms of its teenage star who can be both obnoxious and endearing. With Crispin Glover Jonathan Lipnicki Morris Chestnut Robert Forster Eugene Levy and cameos by a slew of NBA stars. 100 min.

""Like Mike"" ties together the now-hallowed family movie and the childhood sports fantasy into an amiable package that will keep the kids occupied over the long summer holiday weekend. But as with too many studio pics plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure of a pintsize teen orphan whose magic sneakers land him a spot on an NBA squad. Although the court action contains only a fraction of the hoops energy one would expect from a pic co-produced by NBA Entertainment -- and film suffers from the conspicuous absence of the titles Michael Jordan -- wide-ranging crowds will ensure a winning B.O. score for Fox followed by a sweet run through ancillary playoffs. Pic shoots for mass appeal with casting of Lil Bow Wow Snoop Doggs longtime minicompanion in his first lead role as 14-year-old Calvin who is stuck at an orphanage in the shadow of downtown L.A. Calvin initially must face off with big bully Ox (Jesse Plemons) but this tired redux of sentiments that were hip when the Katzenjammers were kids is temporarily shelved when Calvin happens upon a pair of sneakers sporting what seem to be a young Michael Jordans initials. Zapped with lightning during a storm the shoes give Calvin Flubberesque jumping ability which he shows off during a halftime one-on-one contest at Staples Center against Los Angeles Knights star Tracey Reynolds (Morris Chestnut). Since the Knights are struggling in the standings and at the gate general manager Frank Bernard (Eugene Levy) reckons Calvins skills (the under-5-footer can slam-dunk and sink three-pointers) are enough to sign him up. Still Franks original plan is to have Calvin sit on the bench as a mascot for just one game. Its one of many plot complications that writers Michael Elliot and Jordan Moffet allow to muddy what should have been a simpler more enjoyable story. Indeed Calvins developing relationship with an initially skeptical Tracey and gags -- although many uninspired -- that naturally spill on to the screen as the little guy contends with life on the road in the NBA seem to provide enough story elements. Still the plot adds two villains Ox and orphanage director Stan whom thesp Crispin Glover and helmer John Schultz try to turn into a Dickensian villain with a postmodern twist. This leads to pointless distractions like the filmmakers emphasis on Glovers protruding nose Schultz and lenser Shawn Maurer seem to have lit the thesp to particularly weird effect. The other visual effects mostly shots of Lil Bow Wow jumping flying and slamming are nearly upstaged by Glovers odd presence. Meanwhile almost as odd as the absence of MJ himself is the lack of stars from the L.A. teams among pics parade of actual NBA hoopsters. The Knights can be seen as the stand-in squad for the always-underdog Clippers. But members of the team as well as three-peat champs the Lakers are AWOL even though the Lakers vaunted triangle offense is discussed in an especially cute scene between Calvin and Tracey. Instead many of the guys the Lakers habitually beat -- from Chris Webber to Jason Kidd to Allen Iverson -- make rather wooden appearances. (Actually if pic really wanted to be au courant with its target youth market the correct title would be ""Like Kobe."") Lil Bow Wow shows good presence onscreen playing the requisite range of emotions from cocky to frustrated with confidence. Taking a break from his screen career as a ladies man Chestnut puts up solid numbers as a typical stuck-up star who comes around to appreciate the new kid on the block. Levy does a milder variation on his usual shtick while Robert Forster as the Knights coach helps ground the basketball action in something like reality. Tech elements are fine but courtside camerawork is stolid rather than fluid and exciting. As usual in lower-budget Hollywood comedies scene after scene is overlit. Tune-stuffed soundtrack features natch the latest Lil Bow Wow stylings.

"Like Mike No Harm No Foul washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Like Mike No Harm No Foul Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 5 2002 FULL disclosure I dont even follow basketball. I didnt view Michael Jordans return to the game as the second coming of Jesus Christ and I dont care what brand of shoe he wears. I also dont as a rule listen to rap music and until recently I was only distantly familiar with the work of the newly pubescent music sensation known as Bow Wow -- or Lil Bow Wow as he is officially billed (despite the now 15-year-old performers recent efforts to drop the modifier). So you can imagine how little I was looking forward to a movie starring the aforementioned Mr. Wow as Calvin Cambridge a 14-year-old orphan whose dreams of playing in the NBA come true when he finds a pair of magical slipper -- er shoes -- reputed to have once belonged to the legendary Chicago-Bull-turned-Washington-Wizard. That being said I liked ""Like Mike"" a sappy but sweet B-ball Cinderella story that succeeds thanks largely to the outsize charm of its 4-foot-8-inch corn-rowed protagonist. Mind you ""Mike"" is riddled with cliches down to the adorable and ethnically diverse cast of orphans (lisping Jonathan Lipnicki of ""Jerry Maguire"" fame and Brenda Song play Calvins white and Asian best friends); the crusty but caring nun who oversees their education (Anne Meara); and the heartless conniver who runs the place where theyre warehoused (Crispin Glover doing his best Snidely Whiplash schtick). Its every orphan movie youve ever seen from ""Curly Top"" forward wrapped up in a big soggy bundle along with every underdog sports flick ever made including ""Air Bud."" And yet I liked it. Its sense of harmless inoffensive wish fulfillment along with its celebration of fatherhood -- more than a team jersey Calvin wants a daddy -- is genuinely touching if overly familiar and formulaic. And the chemistry is surprisingly unforced between Bow Wow and his professional mentor Tracey Reynolds played by Morris Chestnut as the fictional ""Los Angeles Knight"" who becomes Calvins roommate and father figure when the teens newly discovered skill on the court earns him a berth on an NBA team. On the downside the film plays at times like a commercial both for Nike whose shoes have extensive product placement throughout the movie and for professional basketball. Produced in association with NBA Entertainment and featuring a dozen or more cameos by such real-life players as Allen Iverson Jason Kidd David Robinson and Chris Webber ""Like Mike"" will have instant appeal for those sport-smitten youngsters who lap up every league-approved product tie-in. Yet the bald-faced hucksterism of it all still leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Ultimately though I was able to forgive and forget. Saccharine though it may be ""Like Mikes"" message about finding love and self-esteem is a worthwhile one and outweighs the crass pitch for footwear and season tickets.

"Like Mike Lil Bow Wow Jumps Through the Hoops washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Like Mike Lil Bow Wow Jumps Through the Hoops Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Wednesday July 3 2002 ""Like Mike""? Not really. This ""heartfelt family comedy"" as its marketers describe it is more pointedly a slick piece of cross-promotion for stuff that has nothing to do with the movies. Weirdly the packaging geniuses at the NBA (which co-produced ""Like Mike"") have chosen rap star Lil Bow Wow to sell their basketball tickets and merchandise. Although the preternaturally gifted rapper and dancer is able to strut his stuff for a few minutes in ""Like Mike"" his gifts are largely wasted in favor of a tiresome story and myriad special effects sequences. Maybe next time his agents can find him a movie in which he - oh gee lets see - actually sings and dances. Taking a little from ""Oliver Twist"" here a bit from ""Cinderella"" there and just a dash from ""The Red Shoes"" for good measure ""Like Mike"" concerns a cunning little orphan named Calvin (Bow Wow) whose problem is that he isnt all that young At 13 he has aged out of the infant-toddler stage at which most kids are adopted. Like most youngsters their age Calvin and his best friends at the orphanage Murph and Reg (Jonathan Lipnicki and Brenda Song) are flat-out hoops crazy They while away their time shooting baskets playing one-on-one and cheering on their local NBA team the Los Angeles Knights. But the closest they get to a real game is when theyre forced to sell candy outside the Staples Center by the latter-day Fagin who runs their group home with sadistic despotism (the villain is played with slithery malevolence by Crispin Glover). Calvins life of misery - he desperately longs for a family preferably one like Will Smiths on ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" - is interrupted one day when he tries on a pair of donated sneakers. Not only are they a perfect fit but the initials ""M.J."" are inscribed inside. Convinced that his new shoes once belonged to Michael Jordan Calvin begins to undergo a startling makeover The kid who couldnt shoot straight is suddenly flying through the air just like his idol. When Calvin unexpectedly gets to see a Knights game in person and even more unexpectedly is given the chance to show his new moves during halftime the teams manager (Eugene Levy) sees a gold mine The Knights sign Calvin and find a terrific new marketing gimmick ""Hes lean hes mean hes 13."" ""Like Mike"" features its share of inside-basketball jokes especially some witty segments featuring real-life NBA players like Allen Iverson and Jason Kidd. But despite its moments of comedy and some nice chemistry between Bow Wow and co-star Morris Chestnut as the Knight who reluctantly mentors Calvin theres something troubling about a movie that depicts would-be parents trolling an adoption center like so many Kmart shoppers. It should come as no surprise when Calvin ultimately finds his ""Fresh Prince"" and that he and his friends embark on a wonderful new life. But the frightening myths about adoption that run through ""Like Mike"" make even its happiest endings a little bit creepy. LIKE MIKE (PG 100 minutes) - Contains brief mild profanity. At area theaters.

USATODAY.com - Like Mike entertains but is no slam-dunk Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 07/03/2002 - Updated 1032 AM ET Like Mike entertains but is no slam-dunk By Mike Clark USA Today Sydney Baldwin 20th Century Fox Bow Wow left and Morris Chestnut star in Like Mike. Diminutive rapper Bow Wow is better than a lot of non-actors whove wangled leads in major studio releases but its better not to oversell the earnest energy he brings to Like Mike ( out of four). Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle the movie is a basketball variation on 1993s Rookie of the Year a kids baseball comedy that lifted the premise of 1954s Roogies Bump. And yet if I were a sports-prone youngster I probably would enjoy this picture which tells of a 14-year-old orphan whos given old sneakers brandishing M.J. initials which do not stand for Milla Jovovich. Whether they stand for his eminence Mr. Jordan Calvin Cambridge (Bow Wow) suddenly is possessed of enough basketball skills to become the star of an NBA team the fictional Los Angeles Knights. Perhaps this explains why the L.A. Lakers Shaquille ONeal and Kobe Bryant are not among the hoop stars who show up in cameos. (Though Allen Iverson Chris Webber and Jason Kidd do.) Calvins sudden and consistent conversion of 3-point shots contributes to crowd-pleasing court scenes. But theres also an odd subplot out of Oliver Twist notwithstanding the orphanage directors big-screen TV. Charlies Angels Crispin Glover plays the creep and does what youd expect a Glover character to do speak in exaggerated tones rip off Calvins NBA earnings and torch the only snapshot a Calvin buddy (Jonathan Lipnicki) has of his late mother. Where are the social-services bureaucrats who busted Sean Penn in I Am Sam when you need them? Morris Chestnut (The Brothers) plays Calvins roommate and temporary team rival who becomes a friend and a father substitute. For his part Calvin tries to reconcile his new friend with his estranged dad but the film drops the attempt like a bad in-bounds pass. Chestnuts love life also seems ill-defined though this is an NBA in which players seem less interested in groupies than room-service food. So heres a movie about a 4-foot-6 net star hitting theaters less than three weeks after Juwanna Mann which is about a guy who poses as the opposite sex in a womens basketball league. Its hard to imagine Bobby Knight tuning into either on cable next season even if he gets it for free in his hotel room.

Directed by John Schultz from a screenplay by Michael Elliot and Jordan Moffet. 100 minutes. Rated PG for brief mild language. Several theaters. In ""Like Mike"" a pair of sneakers become the preteen-boy equivalent of Dorothys ruby slippers With them on his feet young Calvin Cambridge (teen hip-hop star Lil Bow Wow) can play basketball like a miniature winged version of his idol Michael Jordan. On court Calvin flies through the air merrily slam-dunking; off-court he even gets to order room service and have a paint fight with an NBA star. Just your basic sports fantasy kid-sized. And its all pretty sweet thanks to a winningly low-key performance by young er Wow. The screenplay does saddle Calvin with plenty of melodrama -- hes an orphan living in a grim group home run by a money-grubbing creep (Crispin Glover looking nastily malnourished) when the NBA comes looking for him. But ""Like Mike"" at its heart is the story of a kid you want to root for and Lil Bow Wow with his easy grin is immensely likable in his screen debut. (The same cannot be said for his co-star Jonathan Lipnicki the kid from ""Jerry Maguire"" whos now 11 but still has the cutesy mannerisms of a 5-year-old. But hes easily ignored.) Morris Chestnut is warm and charming as Calvins NBA roommate and surrogate father figure and numerous NBA stars (including the Sonics Gary Payton) make cameos. At times the film seems like a big NBA commercial which in essence I suppose it is -- ""Like Mike"" is a production of NBA Entertainment thus explaining the prominent display of ""nba.com"" in a key scene. Like all fairy tales ""Like Mike"" has a picture-perfect happy ending; indeed every conflict is resolved with breathless speed (often at the expense of believability). But thats OK; this is a squeaky-clean warmhearted movie parents can send kids to without worries. ""Like Mike"" is about dealing with your fears remembering to wear your seatbelt and believing that dreams can come true -- a nice message even with product placement.

Twentieth Century Fox photo by Sidney Baldwin Score one for young rapper 1 / 2 Back to Gallery LIKE MIKE Sports fantasy. Starring Lil Bow Wow Morris Chestnut and Robert Forster. Directed by John Schultz. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The young man who stars in ""Like Mike"" glows with such winning confidence and sensitivity that I watched the movie wondering where they found such a terrific child actor. Turns out the star of this charming sports fantasy is a platinum-selling rap artist. His name is Lil Bow Wow and he brings real sweetness to his role of a teenage orphan who suddenly finds himself able to play basketball like Michael Jordan . One wouldnt automatically think of rap as a training ground for actors but its proving to be a gold mine -- look at LL Cool J who has proved himself a fine and versatile talent. (The late Tupac Shakur wasnt bad either and neither are Ice T Ice Cube and Will Smith.) Whats especially refreshing about Lil Bow Wow is that hes cheerful and fresh. The usual rap on rappers is that they tend to be unsmiling but Bows face is an open book. He plays Calvin a 14-year-old living in a Los Angeles orphanage. The first minutes of this movie let viewers know theyre in good directorial hands. Director John Schultz gives the orphanage a gritty grainy look. On the weekend prospective parents visit and immediately gravitate toward the toddlers and infants while the older kids watch dejectedly. Its a sad and rather uncompromising beginning for a comedy but it works grounding the fantasy to come in a tough realistic world. The turning point in Calvins life arrives when charity apparel is donated to the home and he ends up with a pair of secondhand sneakers with the initials ""M.J."" written in marker inside. From the moment Calvin puts on the sneakers he becomes an unstoppable basketball phenomenon capable of getting by any defender though barely 5 feet tall. Typical of the many amusing scenes here is one in which Calvin is chosen at random during halftime to play one-on-one with a member of a Los Angeles teams starting five. To the delight of the packed arena Calvin finds himself able to score at will against an opponent twice his size. He can score from the outside and he can also slam dunk the ball by flying through the air toward the basket. Jordan only looked as if he could fly. Calvin really can. In addition to telling a hard-to-beat sports story -- a kid joins the NBA -- ""Like Mike"" tells an affecting tale about a boy with a deep longing for parents and the bond that develops between him and a fussy finicky fellow player. From all appearances Tracy (Morris Chestnut) is the quintessential bachelor with no interest in setting down roots but the movie -- and Chestnut -- let us see in an unforced way how being around Calvin might awaken a paternal instinct. The screenplays emphasis on personal relationships and not just winning and losing makes ""Like Mike"" something more than a typical sports movie. It also gives Lil Bow Wow something to do besides dribble between his legs. It allows an alert and engaging performance to take wing. In this context the sports scenes are just the icing on the cake. Theyre nicely staged. Here we have Lil Bow Wow playing opposite players who dwarf him and yet the game choreography is smooth enough to allow us to believe that the big guys arent just letting him win. Near the finish the movie indulges in some tiresome complications and a chase scene goes on too long and makes for dull viewing -- its as if the filmmakers hearts werent in it and why should they have been? In any case its a minor blemish that takes little away from this appealing movie one of the summers pleasant surprises.

Hes sunny and scrubbed - a cherub in street braids. That makes him perfect to play Calvin a 14-year-old orphan who gets to live out his king-size hoop dreams after he stumbles onto a pair of Michael Jordans old Nikes. The moment he puts on the magic shoes he turns into a zigzagging slam-dunk virtuoso hitting 30-foot jumpers and flying up to the backboard - a notable feat indeed considering the kid is only 4 foot 8. The special effects that accomplish all of this are convincing enough but Like Mike has the synthetically wrapped pseudo-charm of a perfunctory Flubber sequel. Calvin becomes the star novelty of the L.A. Knights wowing crowds at the Staples Center but most of the movie isnt even set on the basketball court. It is rather a will-someone-take-this-child-home sudser with the charismatic Morris Chestnut trying to liven up the surrogate-daddy role of Calvins teammate. There are snoring jokes room-service jokes and the noisy thunk of a plot when Calvin gets his sneakers stolen. The kid quite understandably wants to keep on flying but Like Mike barely gets off the ground.
