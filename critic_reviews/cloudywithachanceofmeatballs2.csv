Remember wide-eyed inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) spunky meteorologist Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) Steve the monkey (Neil Patrick Harris) and all the rest? It doesnt matter if you dont. The innovation lies in the setting after a prologue involving a bad guy more obviously up to no good than Dr Evil were plunged into a tropical world where thanks to the invention that made junk food rain from the skies in the last film foodimals roam free. Imagine a Jurassic Park constructed entirely out of whatever foodstuff best satisfies your appetite for a pun. Theyve got tacodiles flamangoes shrimpanzees and adorable little marshmallow creatures that look exactly like the Adipose blob monsters David Tennant battled in Doctor Who. Those last ones dont have a pun for a name. They dont need one - theyre so cute. This is the level of logic which underpins the whole film. At one point a character even ponders aloud that its probably best not to think too hard about how this ecology might work or whether it makes sense. Amen to that.

Inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) the man whose foodstuff-generating contraption led to the comestible weather patterns in 2009s Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and his gang of pals discover that his invention is still at large. Whats more it has started imbuing its creations with sentience leading to an entire edible ecosystem. Flint is sent on an expedition by his hero (and ultimately we learn the films villain) wavy-armed tech-guru Chester V voiced by Haders former Saturday Night Live co-star Will Forte. He soon comes across all species of ""foodimals"" including?but God knows not limited to?shrimpanzees flamangos and tacodiles. Theres a vague underlying message of vegetarianism or at least anti-corporatism as well as some emotional beats that were hit earlier and harder in the first go-round. But the film mainly subsists on its own manic energy. The animation is inventive and elastic the dialogue zippy and shamelessly punny and the tone lighthearted and fun even if on a whole its not quite a full meal.

Unquestionably the most pun-filled movie of 2013 Cody Cameron and Kris Pearns follow-up expands the world of machine-made delicacies in supremely weird and wonderfully silly directions while preserving the charm and chemistry of the characters introduced in the first film. Simultaneously more adventure-filled and less emotionally affecting than its predecessor ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" makes a shift from disaster-movie to creature-feature tropes with its buffet of savory set pieces and effervescent visuals garnished with delectably sharp-edged humor. Bill Hader reprises his role as Flint Lockwood the inventor of ""FLDSMDFR"" the machine that turned water into food before it transformed his hometown of Swallow Falls into a smorgasbord of oversized chow. After being recruited to work for Chester V (Will Forte) a Steve Jobs-like CEO whose company Live Corp is tasked with cleaning up his mess Flint hunkers down to create the next great device to better humankind. Also read 20 Movies Were Dying to See This Fall But as he his dad Tim (James Caan) and his pals Sam (Anna Faris) Brent (Andy Samberg) and Earl (Terry Crews) settle into new lives in San Fran Jose they are soon asked by Chester to return to Swallow Falls where they discover that his machine has started producing ""foodimals"" living creatures you guessed it made out of fruits vegetables and other tasty vittles. Beyond the films incredible variety of cleverly named creatures including ""susheep"" ""watermelephants"" ""tacodiles"" and ""shrimpanzees"" ""Cloudy 2"" finds more humor per square inch than well any film since the original. Eager to indulge the exaggerated squash-and-stretch style of animation that gave the first film its buoyancy Cameron and Pearn design amazing new sets - like Live Corps headquarters a gigantic light bulb - and then basically explore them like kids digging through a toy box. At the same time the duo manages to keep a tight leash on the story even as theyre deconstructing the conventions of the genres theyre using as a basic narrative framework which provides plenty of straightforward gags for kids while offering a meta-text that adults will enjoy. Also read Fall Movie Preview Hunger Games Thor Shoot for Record-Breaking 2013 at the Box Office Dealing with his first taste of ""popularity"" Flint struggles to find a midpoint between the trust of his new boss and confidante Chester and the loyalty and common sense of his buddies. Hader continues to perfectly balance the characters earnest nerdiness a suitably bonkers imagination and an occasional susceptibility to social acceptance making him someone who might test our patience in real life but on film is a hero we sympathize with and are eager to see prevail. Faris Sam unfortunately has less to do this time around but thankfully Cameron and Pearn preserve her pre-Hollywood makeover style of a ponytail and glasses making sure shes an integral and equal part of the group rather than simply Flints love interest. As Chester meanwhile Forte gets enormous mileage out of his not-so-quietly self aggrandizing ""benevolence"" managing to make him a perfect embodiment of what Flint aspires to be albeit without the underlying humanity that makes his new student such a great likeable kid. Also read Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 Trailer The Food and the Furious Regardless whether its ""Jurassic Park"" and teen-movie goofs are particularly resonant with you the animation is simply gorgeous and utilizes the free reign of its filmmakers imagination to create landscapes that are perfect both for physical confrontations and emotional standoffs. (A lake-sized pool of syrup provides both a wonderful sight gag and a perfect metaphorical location for Flints to choose between Live Corp and his friends.) In which case other than its comparatively muted emotional resonance -- there are no tearful moments like the first films reconciliation between Flint and Tim -- the only caveat to offer about this sequel is that if you have any dislike of puns be warned that there are a ton of them. But even though it doesnt feel quite as fresh or satisfying as the first film ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" offers a surprisingly filling second serving for a series that should probably have only amounted to an amuse-bouche.

Photo Courtesy Of Sony Pictures Animat Sony Pictures Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 review 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Bill Hader Anna Faris Will Forte and James Caan. Directed by Kris Pearn and Cody Cameron. (PG. 95 minutes.) ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" is a humorous yet unfocused romp so unwilling to settle on a single theme that hyperactivity medication should be handed out with the 3-D glasses. The animated sequel starts as a very clever and slightly sinister deconstruction of Silicon Valley culture before morphing into a lightweight ""Jurassic Park"" parody then morphing again into a rousing ""Avatar""-style nature versus machines battle. (The latter incorporates elements of the Battle of Endor with monster tacos instead of Ewoks.) This fear of continuity seems to be a growing trend in animated family films where talented filmmakers are given great amounts of freedom then seemingly use every single concept from their brainstorming session for the movie. ""Despicable Me 2"" had a similar vibe as did the two most recent ""Madagascar"" films. The end result feels like a dormitory food fight - so much fun in the moment before everyone walks away from the ugly aftermath feeling a little guilty and wondering whos going to clean up the mess. ""Cloudy 2"" begins where the first film left off with the island of Swallow Falls covered in giant foodstuffs courtesy of inventor Flint Lockwoods out-of-control cheeseburger replicator. The newly vindicated scientist (voiced again by Bill Hader) is given a choice - to join his friends in a startup or head west and become a cog in Live Corp led by a tech sector icon in the semi-fictitious city of ""San Franjose."" For a very clever half hour Sony Pictures Animation nearly succeeds in out-""Wall-E""-ing Pixar. Live Corps leader is the cult-like figure Chester V (the artists make sure he looks nothing like Steve Jobs or Larry Ellison) who outwardly champions innovation while quietly turning great young minds into scared over-caffeinated drones. This is the Google parody we were never going to get from this summers ""The Internship."" But Chester V is just a way to get the crew back to Swallow Falls which is now being overrun by food/animal hybrids including fearsome Tacodile Supremes Watermelophants and Shrimpanzees. The criticism of the high-tech hype and responsibility is abandoned as Chester V becomes a run-of-the-mill villain with robot henchmen and world domination goals. Its worth noting that the jokes are effective no matter where ""Cloudy 2"" travels. Two new directors and writers duplicate the witty irreverence of the original whether theyre on the West Coast or in the land of Apple Pie-thons. The character design in these films is particularly strong which rescues some of the more obvious sight gags. ""Theres a leek in the boat"" one character screams ... cut to a harmless-looking vegetable with eyes arms and legs. The climax is notably similar to the last films final conflict - a sign that the writers may have just collapsed with exhaustion. Who knows what they have planned for ""Cloudy 3."" (Best guess A satire of social networking before borrowing the time travel plot points from ""Terminator 2"" and ending with a ""Braveheart""-style man-versus-food showdown.) Just keep it funny and well mostly forgive the short attention span cinema. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

This scrumptious sequel follows the same recipe as the 2009 original. More about Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 >> A young inventor bursting with enthusiasm Flint (voiced by Bill Hader) must try to shut down his greatest creation a food-generating machine before it wreaks irreversible damage. An appealing voice cast returns including Anna Faris James Caan Benjamin Bratt Andy Samberg and Neil Patrick Harris. Terry Crews replaces Mr. T as Earl the authoritative cop and Will Forte joins the fun as Chester V Flints boyhood idol who is the rock star of science geeks. Flint and his posse must travel back to Swallow Falls the island he inadvertently buried under layer upon layer of food in the first film. Now those comestibles have sparked to life taking various zoomorphic forms. The result is an edible Oz a julienned Jurassic Park. Nicely rendered too. Youre supposed to fear the giant cheeseburgers but their sesame-seeded buns just make them look delicious. Its a tasty buffet of food gags both visual and verbal. When they say ""Were toast"" they really mean it. The story combines humor with a sprinkle of wholesome romance topped with a hint of pathos. And the soundtrack is cool mostly because of Paul McCartneys latest song ""New"" and a remix of the Ohio Express ""Yummy Yummy Yummy."" The animation is warm and fluid the supporting characters vivid and the direction of Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn clever. The script disappoints at times but kids are unlikely to notice during this riot of color and laughs. But the movie does feel slightly padded with plot additives.

"Movie review Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 cooks up crazy fun - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Movie review Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 cooks up crazy fun Cloudy with a Change of Meatballs 2 Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 starring the voices of Bill Hader Anna Faris James Caan and Will Forte. Video by Jason H. Neubert Betsy Sharkey reviews Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 starring the voices of Bill Hader Anna Faris James Caan and Will Forte. Video by Jason H. Neubert Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic I have no idea what effect foodimals will have on the ecosystem and I do worry. But the 3-D animated movie mash-up that creates such exotic species as taco-diles shrim-panzees banan-ostriches and my favorite fla-mangoes makes for some pretty delicious family fun in ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2.""There are definitely fewer carbs this time around. Whether charges of insensitivity to childhood obesity issues hurled at the first film are the reason ""Cloudy 2"" is overwhelmingly fruit- and veggie-centric. And honestly anyone who can pull off a running joke about leeks that does not make you gag and is in fact a silly delight deserves props. That team involves prolific voice actor Cody Cameron and animator Kris Pearn plucked from the trenches of ""Cloudy"" and plopped into co-directors chairs for ""2"" -- sharing nicely Im sure since the sequels all about getting along. Further extending the weird science first popularized by Judi and Ron Barretts childrens book the screenplay is by Erica Rivinoja John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein.PHOTOS Fall movie sneaks 2013 When last we left the Atlantic island of Swallow Falls aspiring inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) was destroying his greatest achievement the Diatomic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator to save the world from a devastating spaghetti and meatball storm.""Cloudy 2"" picks up with the islands evacuation for cleanup. Its good citizens relocate to the big city of San Franjose -- Silicon Valley with a few hills. Its a place of high-tech glass towers and neutral-toned minimalism controlled by a single conglomerate Live Corp. The company is in the business of the ""betterment of mankind"" so you know right away its eccentric owner Chester V (Will Forte) is up to no good. Ever by his side is new assistant Barb (Kristen Schaal) an orangutan outfitted with a human brain and fighting for a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t. Its an issue.In Flints camp in case you need reminding is Anna Faris TV weathercaster Sam Sparks still swooning over Flint. Mannys behind the camera and Benjamin Bratts behind him. James Caan is Flints outdoorsy dad completely tapped into his sensitive side now and hoping to bond with his boy over manly things. In the long minute or so that separates the two films time frame Andy Sambergs Brent has become a mogul; his Chick-N-Sushi joints are a hit. Earl (Terry Crews) Swallow Falls cop has turned in his badge and turned foodie. And Neil Patrick Harris scamp Steve the Monkey is more essential and up to even more mischief.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot moments Though the movie will go into great detail all you need to know is that Chester Vs designs on world domination involve getting his hands on Flints food replicating machine. You didnt really think it was destroyed did you?It hasnt merely survived its gone mad -- churning out mountains and rivers and swamps and jungles and deserts overrun with 39 different varieties of misbegotten new species.The animation and 3-D effects of this hybrid world are simply stunning and a much-needed jolt after San Franjose and Live Corp.s uniformity. The color is scrumptious and the human characters with their expressive Pinocchio-esque eyes are enchanting. But it is the inventive design of the many creatures that feels so fresh. The detail is so rich and so dense that you wish some of the frames would freeze so you had more time for savoring.They are an eclectic bunch of interlopers. But the best -- as always -- are the more organic mash-ups like those fla-mangoes where the fruit fits the shape of the bird quite nicely. The completely zany creations like the cheeseburger bully that scurries around on spider legs made of French fries are more of a stretch. And that screaming lettuce-spitting taco-dile is slightly scary.ON LOCATION Where the cameras rollBut even if Flint can find and stop his machine what is to be done with this bounty of new breeds?Its a pickle.Because like the tribe of briny bruisers that roam the land foodimals are sweet once you get to know them. Conflict is definitely on the menu as it should be. Its the sides that drag things down. There are more secondary story lines than marshmallow fellows who replicate at rabbit speed.Its all very murky what might happen if the machine fell into the wrong hands (those would be Chester Vs). More worrisome is the way even bigger questions are completely ignored. Like what happens when food becomes our friend -- literally. What do we eat? What do they eat? No clue.But perhaps the only question that matters is whether parents will care if the plot is undercooked as long as their little munchkins are giggling. I think we can hazard a guess on that one.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com | Google+ ----------------------------------------Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2MPAA rating PG for mild rude humorRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Animation (Movie Genre) Movies Entertainment Reviews PG Rated Movies Terry Crews Bill Hader Fall Movie Sneaks 2013 Movie review Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 cooks up crazy fun Review Metallica Through the Never an intriguing but weird beast Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2-review,0,6671981.story?track=rss",200,cloudywithachanceofmeatballs28,cloudywithachanceofmeatballs2,latimes

VPC Scott Bowles USA TODAY 603 p.m. EDT September 26 2013Not as inventive as the original Cloudy 2 may still have enough razzle dazzle to keep the kids entertainedFlint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) left and Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris) return for more food-related fun in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2.(Photo Sony Pictures Animation)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  1/2 out of fourStars Bill Hader Anna Faris James Caan Will Forte Andy Samberg Benjamin Bratt Neil Patrick Harris Kristen SchaalRated PG; runtime 1 hour 35 minutes; opens nationwide FridayHow you view Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2depends largely on the role movies play in your life.If you rely on films to keep your kids entertained and distracted for an hour and a half Meatballs (1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) is a masterwork a visual stunner that manages to break from animations current 3-D rut.If you prefer your kids movies to actually say something the forecast is a little more gray.The inevitable follow-up to the 2009 hit faced a near-impossible task in trying to match the Technicolor palette and offbeat storytelling of the original based on the 1978 childrens book by Judi Barrett and illustrated by Ron Barrett.Alas the sequel directed by Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn continues to establish itself as an aesthetic wonder. But those pretty pictures are hardly worth a thousand words and Meatballs 2 nearly grinds to a narrative halt.STORY In Cloudy 2 giant tacos bite backVIDEO Meet the foodimalsREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersSeemingly picking up minutes after where the first film left off our young genius inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) has just been hailed as the Edison of his animated times after creating the Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator (FLDSMDFR for short) a machine that turns water into bananas the size of Buicks.In a hurried exposition that resembles the set-up of a SpongeBob SquarePantsepisode we learn that the invention not only continues to churn out preposterous produce but that the snacks have become sinister ""foodimals"" that threaten to destroy Flints tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic. Kind of a Jurassic Park of living angry zucchini.The flimsy plot is enough to plunge Flint and his dad (James Caan) and pals Sam (Anna Faris) Earl (Terry Crews) and others back to Swallow Falls where they will face ""tacodiles"" and ""shrimpanzees."" Get it?If you dont dont worry. In place of a story arc Cloudy offers puns aplenty as our heroes worry theyre ""french"" toast and that their boat has sprung a ""leek."" At least the kids are dodging real food instead of hyper-caffeinated cola -- though they all act as if theyve downed a gallon apiece.That though may be the films saving grace as a distraction. Theres not a surprise or moment of tension to be found here but the film is all energy and color that makes the discomfort of 3-D glasses seem worth it.More importantly Cloudy continues to take a decided step away from photo-realistic drawings. Big-budget animation has become obsessed with rendering cartoons as convincing as a picture with much success. But Cloudy embraces a world found only in an animators mind -- one worth exploring if you check your brain at the FLDSMDFR. 22 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1fsmgwBFall Movies Calendar OctoberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this October.

Characters likably struggled to connect and spaghetti twisters and other visuals lived up to that colorful title. So now we get a 3-D animated sequel ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2."" Its another brightly rendered effort but as the title indicates a lot of the real creativity seems to have been used up the first time around. Misfit inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) and friends are dropped into a ""Jurassic Park"" setting when his food-raining invention begins churning out ""foodimals."" Nicely designed but shades of the exotica in ""The Croods."" And ""The Lorax."" And the Candyland riff in ""Wreck-It Ralph."" Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

Credit Sony Pictures Animation Opens on Friday. Directed by Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn1 hour 35 minutesThere are moments of visual humor in the animated sequel ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" that are so inventive they feel like a glimpse of a cartoon masterpiece Jerry Lewis might have made. Most of the best scenes set in a place called San Franjose eerily capture the pink light of the Bay Area better than anyone since Wayne Thiebaud or Richard Diebenkorn. These scenes also sum up the tech culture there of shiny white start-ups and endless lattes.But when the friends -- voiced by Bill Hader Anna Faris and Neil Patrick Harris (as a scene-stealing talking monkey) -- return to their island home which has become overrun by living food products the film loses its originality and instead pays homage to ""Jurassic Park"" as if set in Oz. Despite these aspirations at its best and also at its worst the film and particularly its goofy tech-guru villain seem more resonant of ""Zoolander.""Language in the film is also interesting. Cute is used as a noun as in a ""car powered by cute."" There is a bizarre instance of a strawberry translating the baby-talk of the foodimals. And the rampant puns begin to feel like linguistic pranking. (I appropriately groaned the first time ""theres a leek in the boat"" was used.)So this is a film for ""Zoolander"" fans children parents and those who enjoy occasional bits of nonsensical psychedelic plotting. People who are partial to adorable things like pet strawberries and a family of kawaii-style marshmallows will also enjoy the movie. At times it felt as if this film might challenge Pixars decade-long reign but that promise wanes. Instead the movie is sometimes so strange colorful and wildly cute that it may end up becoming a ""Yellow Submarine"" for a new generation. The soundtrack with a score by Mark Mothersbaugh even features a new song by Paul McCartney.""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for bathroom humor.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The food-swamped town of Swallow Falls has a new problem The leftovers are alive. Rated PG (some rude humor) BOTTOM LINE A gaseous overstuffed sequel to the charming 2009 original. CAST Bill Hader Anna Faris Will Forte Andy Samberg LENGTH 135 Back in 2009 Sony Pictures Animation successfully stretched a short childrens book ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" into a feature film. The story centered on science geek Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) and spunky weather girl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) who protected the island of Swallow Falls from the spaghetti storms and meatball meteors he invented. Writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller piled on the food-based humor but also mixed in three key ingredients charm intelligence and heart. For ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" Lord and Miller are gone and so is nearly everything that made the first film a treat. The likable Hader and Faris are back and a few jokes are worth an adult chuckle. Mostly ""Cloudy 2"" relies on the usual noxious recipe for junky kid flicks loud noise pop music and poop jokes. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The discombobulated story begins with Swallow Falls in FEMA mode its food-soaked citizens forcibly evacuated. Flint goes to work for tech guru Chester V (a funny Will Forte) head of LiveCorp ""the coolest hippest company in the world"" based in San FranJose. Chester a parody of various Silicon Valley gurus is a clever creation but whats his connection to Swallow Falls? It turns out Flint didnt quite destroy his food-generating gizmo and the island is now a ""Jurassic Park"" of living foodstuffs populated by shrimpanzees and flamangoes. Chester wants them destroyed but Flint isnt sure. ""Cloudy 2"" is so overstuffed with ham-fisted jokes -- sorry even Im doing it -- it leaves little time for Flint and his friends to interact. Dopey Brent (Andy Samberg) spastic monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris) tough cop Earl (Terry Crews replacing Mr. T) and Flints gruff dad (James Caan) do a lot of shouting and screaming but little else. Some gags make no sense -- pickles that go fishing? -- and too many are of the ""cut the cheese"" variety. At least this butt-obsessed sequel isnt in 3-D. Frenetically directed by Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" shoves as much down your throat as it can. In the end though youll leave feeling empty. 208 Moviesanimated movie PLOT The food-swamped town of Swallow Falls has a new problem The leftovers are alive. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (some rude humor) CAST Bill Hader Anna Faris Will Forte Andy Samberg LENGTH 135 BOTTOM LINE A gaseous overstuffed sequel to the charming 2009 original. 307 KidsdayKidsday interviews Bill Hader Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Photo AP Movie Review 1 out of 4 Stars. Taco hell. Running time 95 minutes. Rated PG (mild crude humor). At the Union Square the Magic Johnson the Lincoln Square others. MORE FROM Kyle Smith Hillary is the smart kid but Trumps the bad boy -- and thats her problem Indignation is an important devastating look at 50s youth Thrilling Nerve never takes its foot off the pedal Bad Moms good laughs The worst Bourne movie is still pretty good Whelk I hope the makers of ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" earned a nice celery but Im afraid they made a hash of things. A hash seasoned with oy sauce. The beloved childrens book-turned-semi-beloved 2009 movie is now more or less just a field upon which five writers toss half-jokes and food gags. Sample ""Theres a leak in my boat"" Pan over to a leek in the boat. (Thats one of the better lines.) Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) who in the first film invented a machine that turned water into food and wound up creating disastrous (if delicious) weather this time leaves his wrecked town Swallow Falls with his crew to work for a tech mogul named Chester V (Will Forte) at an Apple-like corporation called livE -- a Silicon Valley Oz. Chester V a distinctively dressed fellow with a habit of pressing his palms together while saying ""Namaste"" and boasting that he has created ""the coolest company in the world"" is a parody of Steve Jobs which at least gives adults something to notice. But then again Steve Jobs was a parody of Steve Jobs. The movie doesnt get much mileage out of this figure amusing though it is that St. Steve gets his bottom paddled here. Chester Flint Flints girlfriend (Anna Faris) and buddies head back from livE to the wreckage of Swallow Falls with a mission to wipe out the animal-food hybrids (a cheeseburger with spidery French fry legs shrimpanzees susheep) that are rampaging through the place. The doomsday device? A ""BS-USB"" gadget. BS. Get it? Not a lot to get. See what I mean about half-jokes? When someone says something will be a ""piece of cake"" theres a little anthropomorphic hunk of gateau sitting nearby -- but thats not actually a joke. Nor is naming a babyish strawberry ""Barry."" Nor is the endless grumbling by Chesters assistant (Kristen Schaal) that shes an ape but not a monkey nor Flints fisherman dad (James Caan) inserting the word ""chum"" into every third sentence nor everyones stumbling over the name of Flints awkwardly named machine the FLDSMDFR. It might politely be said that the writers didnt sweat things too much because they knew the animators are the stars. These latter do indeed take up a lot of the slack. While the characters are wandering haphazardly killing screen time until the bad guy can get eaten by a cheeseburger there is a rich pageant of colorfully bonkers images. Its all playful watermelephants and deadly taco-diles and adorable little marshmallows floating in formation like ducks. Too bad sharp digital work had to be wasted on a story thats as cutting-edge as a Commodore 64.

(Courtesy of Sony Pictures Animation) By Sean OConnell September 26 2013 Experienced chefs will tell you that changing one or two crucial ingredients in a prize-winning recipe can turn a delectable meal into a flavorless dish youd hesitate to feed to your pet. A similar switch deflates Sony Pictures Animations sequel ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2."" Original co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have departed the ""Cloudy"" kitchen choosing instead to apply their weird imaginative senses of humor to 2012s irreverent ""21 Jump Street"" and next Februarys promising ""The Lego Movie."" But even though their ""Cloudy"" replacements Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn have access to almost all of the components that helped make the first film a critical and commercial success this noisy sequel delivers about as much pizzazz as reheated leftovers. (If it seems like Im leaning too heavily on culinary references Im merely taking a cue from the ""Cloudy"" screenplay which never met a food-inspired pun it didnt want to embrace celebrate then drive into the ground.) The sequel picks up eight minutes after the 2009 ""Cloudy"" concluded. Amateur inventor Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) continues to clean up the delicious mess created by his Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator a device that turns water into food. His faulty invention catches the eye of Chester V (Will Forte) -- Flints childhood idol and the mysterious chief executive of a burgeoning idea factory named Live Corp. Chester offers Flint a dream job at the California company but his first assignment sounds familiar Hes ordered to return to his hometown of Swallow Falls and once again disconnect the Food Replicator which currently is creating hundreds of new edible species called Foodimals. The first ""Cloudy"" whipped a tornado of tasty food jokes into a spot-on satire of natural-disaster pictures like ""Twister"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow."" Lord and Miller took the simple concepts of Judi Barretts 1978 childrens book and blew them up to epic proportions (and portions) lampooning Hollywoods overblown post-apocalyptic film genre in the process. But instead of upping the ante as so many sequels do ""Cloudy 2"" merely gets the band back together -- including perky weather girl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) immature bully Brent (Andy Samberg) and Flints level-headed father (James Caan) -- for a repetitive mission that calls to mind multiple beats from the first movie. Even stranger once back in Swallow Falls ""Cloudy 2"" proceeds to lift scenes references and bits of dialogue from ""Jurassic Park."" The towering T-Rex is replaced by a Tacodile Supreme. Preying velociraptors are now cheesburger-spider hybrids that roam the island making things difficult for Flint. But theres a difference between cleverly referencing a cultural touchstone like ""Jurassic Park"" and blatantly stealing from it. ""Cloudy 2"" doesnt figure that out. The ""Cloudy 2"" script panders with sophomoric jokes about cutting the cheese excreting ""jam"" from a talking strawberrys bowels or swinging through a cavernous laboratory using wedgie-proof underwear. Kids will chuckle for sure. But parents who were pleasantly surprised by the original films intelligence will miss Lord and Millers guiding hands as what once felt so funny now leaves a stale taste.

This ones an innocuous time-waster.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune September 26 2013 -- 247pm  Sony Pictures Animation This film image released by Sony Pictures Animation shows characters from left Earl voiced by Terry Crews Flint voiced by Bill Hader and Sam voiced by Anna Faris in a scene from ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In the pun-laden parlance of ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" food scientist Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) faces an eggsistential crisis. In the 2009 original story his miracle water-into-food-making device went blooey burying his island hometown of Swallow Falls in a deluge of cheeseburger hail and pasta tornadoes. In ""Cloudy 2"" the gizmo goes further on the fritz turning the food-flooded town into a Jurassic Park of Hippotatomuses Tacodiles Bananostriches and Wildebeets. For all that its hardly a comedic feast. Like its overeager hero ""Cloudy"" charges off wildly in all directions. Rather than picking targets for its humor and firing a few bulls-eyes it shoots off random gags like buckshot scoring some hits and plenty of misses. ""Cloudy 2"" brings back the first films cast with all their tics intact. Weather announcer Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) is now Flints best gal pal. Reformed bully Brent (Andy Samberg) is his even more bumbling sidekick. Blustering policeman Earl (Terry Crews replacing Mr. T) is on hand for situations requiring fortitude and muscle. And Flints widowed father Tim (James Caan) hopes to forge a closer relationship with his son through a fishing trip that never seems to get past the planning stage. cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for mild rude humor. Theres a dose of high-tech corporate satire with Apple-like LIVE Corp. -- ""the coolest company ever"" -- recruiting Flint to join the ranks of its master scientists (but actually to seize his haywire invention). Lives founder slippery tech guru Chester V (Will Forte in evil Steve Jobs mode) is shadowed by a platoon of lookalike holograms the ultimate yes men. The companys absurd efforts to keep its employees productively over-caffeinated and Chesters New Age platitudes wont make much sense to the films grade-school target audience. On the other hand most grownups will get more pleasure from their kids reaction to the corny Shrimpanzees and Cheespiders than from the facile jokes (""Theres a leek in my boat""). Where the film excels is its look. Directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn give the characters a flailing Play-Doh flexibility and a cartoonish visual design thats quite pleasing. Hurricane-haired wide-eyed Flint is a likable dweeb just standing there while Chester with his sharp triangular goatee and rubbery arms is a disturbing sight even as he pours on his oily smarm. The architecture of LIVEs headquarters resembles a sleek sterile honeycomb. The anthropomorphic food creatures are sweet and the film even wrings good laughs from its use of color. Flints new party-in-a-box invention the explosive Celebrationator splatters multicolored goo in a 30-foot radius like so much sticky confetti. After its triggered the area resembles the site of a particularly heated paintball contest. An innocuous time-waster ""Cloudy 2"" will surely be a family smash. Too bad a film about the joys of invention and creativity didnt embody those qualities itself. Watermelephants?

BY Jordan Hoffman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 26 2013 1200 PM Title Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 Film Info PG Language. Area theaters. 3-D where available. The squibbly Minions of ""Despicable Me 2"" have some serious competition on being the cutest -- and most quotable -- cartoon creations this year. In ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" Barry the Berry perfect in design and simplicity gives a scene-stealing nonsense-language speech to his fellow sentient fruits vegetables and meats. Anyone who doesnt laugh is allergic to fun. Barry is just one of dozens of creative pun-tastic ""foodimals"" in this bright and engaging sequel thats no mere pile of leftovers. This is unquestionably 2013s best animated movie so far. After a recap for those who missed the 2009 original wide-eyed inventor Flint Lockwood (an endearing-sounding Bill Hader) finds himself under the wing of his scientist hero Chester V (motor-mouthed Will Forte). Flints home island is quarantined following the first films food-weather assault. In the city of ""San Franjose"" Flint starts working for Chesters caffeine-addicted genius hub called Live Corp. Chester talks like a Steve Jobs-ish visionary but only the youngest audience members wont see that hes got an evil scheme on his menu. A dill pickle in Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 What Chester wants is Flints old miracle gizmo the FLDSMDFR -- pronounced as it is spelled of course and always entertainingly -- which is back on the island and creating living food. The trusting Flint unknowingly aids in the dastardly plot. When Flint and his gang (sunny Anna Farris gruff James Caan dimwit Andy Samberg excitable Terry Crews talking monkey Neil Patrick Harris) first lay eyes on these edible creatures it plays like ""Jurassic Park."" The giant spider-like cheeseburger with French-fry legs is a miracle of animation simultaneously scary and adorable. There are watermelophants and hippo-potatomuses shrimp-anzees and mosquitoasts and well you should sample the rest of this pun buffet yourself. ""Cloudy 2"" is loud weird and chaotic -- just as kids like it. Theres plenty of screaming and running while arms flail about and even the obligatory message bit is given a healthy dose of ""yeah yeah yeah."" Your car ride back from the theater wont be a quiet one but sometimes its good to have a sugary treat.

"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 4 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 4 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 Good 4 stars Directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn.Cast Bill Hader Anna Faris Will Forte.Rating PG-13 for mild rude humor. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Sep 26 2013 1005 AM ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" the 2009 film based on Ron and Judi Barretts childrens book was freewheeling and funny well-realized the kind of thing where conventional wisdom says leave it alone no sequel is necessary. Good thing these people didnt listen to conventional wisdom. Though Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn take over directing duties from Phil Lord and Chris Miller ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" picks up where the first film left off literally and offers at least as many laughs (if not more for adults) retaining the goofy attitude. Cameron and Pearn throw a lot at the wall just like their predecessors and most of it sticks. In the first movie Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader) was a brilliant-if-hapless inventor. He had good ideas. They just seemed always to go awry. He developed a gadget that could turn water into food but that too caused problems -- food storms and overeating combined for disaster. But with the help of meteorologist Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) and Flints dad Tim (James Caan) disaster was narrowly averted when Flint destroyed the machine. And thats where the sequel begins. Theres still a mess on Swallows Falls the island where Flint lives. But in comes Flints boyhood hero Chester V (Will Forte) a television personality and legendary inventor who has built Live Corp a company with an Apple/Google-like campus where all the inventors who are anybody want to work. Like Flint. Chester extends an offer Sam and Tim and Flints other friends support him and soon theyre off to the big city where Tim tries to come up with inventions clever enough to land him a coveted position on Chesters team. But trouble is brewing. Chester informs Flint that the water-into-food machine was not destroyed and is instead creating dangerous food-animal hybrids that could migrate to other places and destroy the Earth foodimals. (If you dont think the name is the slightest bit funny youre going to miss out on a lot of the jokes.) Chester convinces Flint to ignore his friends and go back to the island to find the machine and destroy it. Seriously now has turning your back on your friends ever been a good idea? So yes there are lessons learned here as in the first movie and once again the filmmakers wisely dont beat you over the head with them. Their approach isnt more subtle -- they work the lessons in while beating you over the head with visual and verbal gags -- but it is effective. As with ""Superbad"" ""Knocked Up"" and other more-adult fare there is a sweetness inherent to ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" (and the original). Plus there is a nod to a famous science-fiction movie toward the end of the film that is played perfectly subtle enough to let you feel good about recognizing it without giving too much away. Of course ""Cloudy 2"" doesnt boast the go-for-broke originality of the first film. Uh by definition Its a sequel. But its the rare one that takes the spirit of the original and runs with it coming up with something uniquely good in its own right. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Tasty second helping not same old leftovers September 26 2013|Michael PhillipsStill from ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2."" (Sony Pictures Publicity)Thanks to the likes of ""Ice Age"" most animated features rely on a general wash of sarcasm-based meanness atop sequences of hammering photo-realistically rendered peril. Throw in a rote message of friendship and a reminder of the importance of family before the up-tempo closing credits and the people will come. Same old thing but louder? Count me in.So when a modest quick-witted charmer such as ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" comes along attention must be paid.In this case the credit goes to the writers Erica Rivinoja (whose credits include ""Grounded for Life"" ""Up All Night"" and ""South Park"") and the team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" -- we all make mistakes). Directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn take over for the sequel to the medium-size 2009 success.This isnt groundbreaking moviemaking either visually or in terms of story. But ""Cloudy 2"" moves well. The characters dont communicate primarily by way of day-old pop culture references or mean-girl/bully-boy snark. Most important the writers and artists take the business of running gags and throwaway gags and all sorts of gags seriously. In other words Its funny.Having seen the first ""Cloudy"" several hundred movies ago Id forgotten most of the plot machinery. The sequel does nicely catching us up. Enterprising inventor Flint Lockwoods amazing ""food replicator"" which caused so much grotesquely filling havoc in the earlier film has been destroyed. (None of this was in the original storybook; only the title survives.) The sequel introduces what happens just seconds after the end of the first. The island of Swallow Falls is evacuated by the representatives of Live Corp. whose inspirational founder is a wily combination of Steve Jobs and Richard Branson and whose new product launch -- the ""8.0 food bar"" -- promises to be a global phenomenon.But the food replicators still alive and ticking. On the island strange and tasty things have been spawned food-animal hybrids of uncertain bloodthirstiness. Mosquitoes resembling two slices of bread? Mosquitoasts. Tacos with a suggestion of the crocodile? Tacodiles. A cuddly oversize strawberry? It goes by the name of Barry. ""Cloudy 2"" is insatiable when it comes to food-borne puns.The movies being sold on the images of marauding baked-potato hippos and the like and certainly the film offers its share of such sequences. But as Flint his weather caster girlfriend Sam his fisherman-dad and his pet monkey Steve explore the mysterious island and the plot thickens ""Cloudy 2"" refuses to turn into another stupid action movie disguised as a kids diversion. For the adults yes there are hints of scenes from ""King Kong"" to ""Soylent Green"" to ""Jurassic Park."" But any sharp underager can get a laugh out of such fleet-footed bits as someone running down what appears to be an alley hitting a wall and then realizing along with the audience that its a billboard for an alley company (""Building quality alleys since 1973"").Bill Hader once again voices Flint sweetly and well. Anna Faris and James Caan return in relaxed and easygoing form as Sam and Flints father respectively. Neil Patrick Harris works miracles with one-word utterances in the role of Steve the monkey. Will Forte is a bit of a drag as Chester V the visionary Jobs-like guru but not enough to cause trouble.The directors realize the value of holding a shot and keeping several lines of dizzy action going within that shot so that whatever Steves up to for example can be glimpsed peripherally at first. The jokes keep coming as does the food. The movie is better in every respect than the original ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" Its also more fun than all three ""Ice Ages""; ""Monsters University""; ""Planes""; ""Epic""; ""Despicable Me 2""; and though I could go on I wont.mjphillipstribune.com""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG (for mild rude humor)Running time 135Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesFoodimals stalk animated film world of Cloudy With a...September 26 2013Illini`s Qb Derby Plot ThickeningJuly 30 1987Flint Takes Pride In Spartans BedrockMarch 27 1999The Plot Thickens For PacersMarch 20 2000Cheaper picks up a plot in second go-roundDecember 21 2005Find More Stories AboutCreditsSteve JobsSequelTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0924-cloudy-chance-meatballs-2-20130926,0,1947312.column",200,cloudywithachanceofmeatballs219,cloudywithachanceofmeatballs2,chicagotribune

Animation has inked a grand tradition of cruelty from Wile E. Coyotes countless failed firebombings to modern-day kiddie cash-grabs in which the most common punch line is a fall or a fart. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Cant we all just get along? In Cody Cameron and Kris Pearns good-hearted Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 the answer is yes -- unless youre made of food. (Cannibals stay home.) The first film which turned a 32-page childrens book into an unexpected critical darling was a celebration of all things nerd. On an island named Chewandswallow where the only food is sardines young inventor Flint (Bill Hader) concocted the Flint Lockwood Diatomic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator a gizmo that turns water into whatever foodstuffs he wants. Cue an unnatural disaster The machine went berserk in the clouds and flung giant meatballs at the town keeping Flint so frantic that he couldnt seal the deal with Sam (Anna Faris) a cute glasses-wearing weather girl. Thats cool -- and that love stuff was mushier than a one-ton banana.The sequel starts seconds after the climactic food fight. Flints a hero but his home is a mess. Enter his hero TV scientist Chester V (Will Forte) a Twizzler-slim goateed guru who would have Steve Jobs clawing angrily out of his grave to complain if he hadnt already dug himself out to rage about being played by Ashton Kutcher. Chester is the inventor of his own life-changing pocket-sized rectangle a food bar. Though busy tinkering with an update the Food Bar 8.0 Chester promises a solution the citizens cant resist Hell send his minions to scrape off the cheese and temporarily relocate everyone to the city of San Franjose. Better still hell hire Flint for an entry-level job at Live Corp a lightbulb-shaped genius factory with a coffee station every 15 feet.Film DetailsCritics Pick Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time95 min.

Its above-average cute stuff that celebrates friendship and brains as Flint Sam and their crew -- a moron in a chicken suit (Andy Samberg) a multitasking cameraman (Benjamin Bratt) an Old Spice-slathered cop (Terry Crews) a monkey and Flints monobrowed dad (James Caan) -- return to the island discover Chesters secret plans and blah blah blah hugs hugs high fives.

Theres hippotatomuses shrimpanzees fruit cockatiels and apple piethons. Theres snapping tacodiles pesky mosquitoasts rampaging wildebeets and hungry cheespiders with watchful sesame seed eyes. Then there are the foodimals who simply are what they are only cuter sour pickles sweet berries and screaming leeks the latter of which sounds like the greatest 90s alt band never made. By the time a marshmallow blinks its goggle-eyes and curls up with a flock of mini-marshmallow babies you may be convinced youve wandered into the ultimate Japanese grocery store -- or perhaps snuck in a very special brownie.Usually when the creators of a cartoon claim to have laced in grown-up jokes it means for every four pratfalls theres an oblique reference to Paris Hilton or Jay Leno. Instead the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs franchise takes its comic cues from The Muppets and Pee-wees Playhouse kids shows that ripen as their audience matures.If the first film was a surprise the second is a shock -- after original directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller decamped to make the also unexpectedly terrific 21 Jump Street reboot and the upcoming Lego Movie this follow-up could have been fast-food franchised. New co-director Pearn deadpanned that taking over the reins was ""an organic choice"" but Lord and Miller are aware that the sequels quality reflects on them even without their names on the poster. Despite their commitments theyve stayed on as executive producers to remain as vigilant over the series as the Colonel is over his secret blend of 27 spices.Will kids notice? Nah. They wont even get a joke about butter versus Parkay. But if I were the parent of an oversensitive 7-year-old the kind who loves ponies and gets squeamish about hot dogs Id take them straight from the theater to a therapists couch before they swore off eating anything but rock candy and maple syrup the only insentient calories in this comestible Jurassic Park. When strawberries give big speeches and blueberries grow chest hair whats mealtime and whats murder? Tellingly even the characters in the film barely eat and when a tribe of pickles goes nuts for sardines the idea of flesh-eating gherkins is as subversive as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.Hey heres a bad idea. Lets ask Morrissey ""Heifer whines become human cries/Closer comes the screaming knife/This beautiful creature must die/This beautiful creature must die.""Is it too late to have him do the soundtrack?CLOUD WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 2 | Directed by Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn | Written by John Francis Daley Jonathan M.

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 set phasers to pun | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 set phasers to punCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 keeps the food puns flying thanks to a new breed of yummy animals.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Sept. 26 2013Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2Starring the voices of Bill Hader Anna Faris Kristen Schaal James Caan Will Forte and Neil Patrick Harris. Directed by Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn. 94 minutes. Opening Sept. 27 at major theatres. GThe food puns fly on frantically beating wings -- in eye-searing colours and passable 3D -- in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 the sequel to the 2009 animated kids hit comedy based on the childrens book by Judi and Ron Barrett.Article Continued BelowInventor and passionate nerd Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) is looking for a brainstorm to make up for his former failure from the first Cloudy a machine that turned water into food with disastrous results. Inspired to take a chance on a new creation by meteorologist pal Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) hes working on a new invention to earn him a coveted slot at The Live Corp. run by his idol the all-powerful guru Chester V. But what should it be? Spray-on shoes? A party in a box?Chester (Will Forte) working a Steve Jobs vibe in one of several gags geared to adults in the audience takes only the top minds to be one of his crew to help build a better tomorrow through technology. Job one is cleaning up Flints hometown of Swallow Falls which is still in a food coma thanks to his now-destroyed invention.Flint lands his coveted job and eases into his new workplace with the help of Chesters Majordomo (and favourite invention) Barb (Kristen Schaal) an orangutan with a human brain and a fondness for glitter nail polish.Flint accompanied by his taciturn simian sidekick Steve (Neil Patrick Harris) is so busy trying to be a Live Corp. genius he doesnt realize hes alienating his fisherman dad Tim (James Caan) best pal Sam and the rest of his crew.Not only is he having a rough time at Live Corp. it gets worse when Flint learns that his water-into-food machine is not only still working its now churning out terrifying foodimals -- food-animal hybrids. He has to find a way to stop it and save the world. Again.In a Jurassic Park-like aha moment the camera moves from the shocked friends faces as the screen fills with every imaginable food creature from graceful long-necked scallion giraffes to wide-mouthed hippotatomuses lumbering watermelophants and screeching shrimpanzees. Things get more complicated -- and slightly scary for younger moviegoers -- when a ravenous tacodile (supreme) with a hot-pepper tail and a massive cheespider with hundreds of sesame seed eyes and french fry legs show up to chase some humans.Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn take over directing duties from Part 1 helmers Phil Lord and Chris Miller and the results are even more frenetic than the first outing.But there are also gentler moments that repeatedly settle on a running theme of the importance of friendship and family including a quite charming bit involving some clumsy pickles and fishing rods.The same type of visual jokes and laughter-generating witty asides from the first serving of Meatballs are also on the sequels menu. Less welcome is the return of a predictable story along with an occasionally heavy handed serving of the moral to our tale.Still at its heart Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 is fun even if it is occasionally so chaotic it tramples the movies flow like a herd of stampeding Buffaloafs. For the most part theres nothing wrong with playing with your food especially when it plays back in such delightful ways.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet To consume a steady diet of big-screen cartoons is to be at once wowed by the regular advances in computer animation and bored by the stories theyre often being used to tell. (Its the cinematic equivalent of gifted gastronomists toiling away in the kitchen of an Arbys.) For the latest depressing example look to Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2. In this manic perfunctory sequel the same malfunctioning magic machine that caused food to rain from the sky in the first Cloudy has turned the quaint island community of Swallow Falls into an edible lost world. Out of the gourmet foliage crawl carnivorous truck-sized cheeseburgers that walk on french-fry legs and spin webs of cheese and tribes of pickle men nattering like the minions of Despicable Me. Both the creatures and their jungle habitat look good enough to eat; lots of time money and loving care has been poured into the project assuring that every sentient vegetable has the perfect shape color and texture. What a pity then that almost no imagination has been expended on the narrative an adventure built on easy lessons about the importance of friendship and the dangerous allure of fame. Like too many sequels this second helping of Meatballs confuses bigger for better piling on the action but misplacing much of the originals charm. Picking up literally seconds after the events of its predecessor Cloudy 2 finds plucky inventor Bill Hader falling under the influence of his childhood hero a billionaire mogul/scientist (Will Forte) who tricks the young egghead into searching for his delicacy-creating device buried somewhere among the delectable wildlife of his overrun hometown. (Naturally Hader brings along all his old celeb-voiced friends though the overzealous policeman is now played by Terry Crews instead of Mr. T.) While the technical department offers a cornucopia of visual treats the writers mostly serve leftovers; their plot reheats several elements from Pixars Up including a tropical-paradise setting a personal idol who turns out to be a scoundrel and an animal sidekick with a translator. Directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn also riff on Jurassic Park and in the superior first act the gee-whiz corporate culture of Google. The best sight gag on the menu is a grid of office cubicles each housing a scientist and his work-in-progress invention. Like the films animators these industrious wage slaves break their backs in service of a greedy imperfect vision. Pun fanatics will certainly get their fill as many of the jokes here amount to little more than cramming together the names of food and fauna. (To viewers of a certain age or sensibility ""Theres a leek in my boat"" will seem the height of witty wordplay.) But the morals dont go down as smoothly. Especially hard to swallow is the films severely confused perspective on ethical eating. Just to clarify Its wrong to convert these oversized food monsters back into meals but perfectly okay to keep slaughtering actual animals for their meat? A PETA membership isnt necessary to choke on that mixed message.

TWITTER Bill Hader Anna Faris and James Caan once again lend their voices to the follow-up to the 2009 animated hit. It might not possess the robust charm of its 2009 predecessor but Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 nevertheless gets an amusing boost from a genetically modified marauding menagerie of Tacodiles Watermelophants Sasquashes and assorted other ""Foodimals"" that have overtaken the once-tranquil island of Swallow Falls. While the inventive mashups make the rest of the storytelling feel like an undercooked side dish by comparison their presence alone should ensure that the 3D animated sequel easily whets the appetite of the broad audience that made the first installment a 243 million worldwide box-office treat. Provided theyve allowed a sufficient distance from the self-cannibalizing summer 2013 animation glut Sony Pictures handing the release the slot occupied this time last year by Hotel Transylvania should anticipate similarly sunny results. PHOTOS Elijah Wood in Hobbit and 16 Other Cameos in Prequels Reboots and Remakes Where the first movie took a loose cue from the book of the same name by Judi and Ron Barrett the sequel goes off in its own direction rather than taking a page out of their print follow-up Pickles to Pittsburgh. Picking up mere moments from where things left off in the last installment Cloudy 2 finds Swallow Falls having to cope with the big gooey mess left by those spaghetti tornadoes and other torrential tidbits. Overseeing the massive clean-up operation is Chester V (voiced by Will Forte) a blue-jean billionaire cross between Steve Jobs Richard Branson and P.T. Barnum who heads up the Live Corp. global empire. Dealing with those masses of leftovers means temporarily relocating well-meaning inventor Flint Lockwood (the returning Bill Hader) along with perky meteorologist Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) reformed nemesis ""Baby"" Brent (Andy Samberg) Steve the Monkey (Neil Patrick Harris) former police officer Earl Devereaux (Terry Crews ably replacing the originals Mr. T) and Flints stoic dad (James Caan). But upon returning they discover their home has been overrun by the aforementioned Foodimals (also including Shrimpanzees Susheep French fry-legged Cheespiders and swarms of Mosquitoasts) being churned out by the presumed-disabled FLDSMDFR. VIDEO Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 Trailer It also turns out that Chester V isnt the benevolent guru/mentor the impressionable Flint thought he was. Having moved on to 21 Jump Street and the upcoming Lego Movie the first films Phil Lord and Chris Miller handed over the directorial reins to Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn both of whom have a long association with Sony Pictures Animation. Swapping the disaster-flick motif of the original for a monster-movie overlay they lend the proceedings a zippy visual energy and get fine support from their energetic voice cast. But they cant gloss over the uninspired plotting convoluted exposition (especially in the clunky setup that gets the characters off the island) and truly pun-ishing dialogue credited to Erica Rivinoja (South Park) and John Francis Daley amp; Jonathan Goldstein (Horrible Bosses). And although the 3D barely computes few will likely notice -- what with all those flocking Flamangos and wide-eyed strawberries providing ample distraction.

Households with kids who dont eat meat out of respect for other living creatures could be thrown into wild upheaval by the arrival of ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" a thoroughly nutty sequel to Sonys 2009 toon that anthropomorphizes every munchie imaginable. Now even strawberries have souls -- to say nothing of such hybrids as ""tacodiles"" and ""watermelophants."" As cracked as all the pics Franken-foodstuffs may be it took guts to fix such an unconventional follow-up which could do decent biz catering to the very young and very stoned alike while offering global merchandising opportunities galore. Too bad this philosophically conflicted junk-food lark isnt content to rot kids teeth going after their brains as well.This story first appeared in the October 01 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Until ""The Smurfs"" came along ""Cloudy"" was the closest thing the struggling Sony Pictures Animation division had to a hit. That said the unlikely sequel -- in which frustrated inventor Flint Lockwoods genetically modified leftovers evolve into full-blown ""foodimals"" wreaking havoc on the island of Chewandswallow -- aspires to a bigger audience than the first movies 125 million box office and yet ties a surprising number of its jokes to the earlier film. Judging by a prologue that clunkily attempts to recap what came before it might have been wiser to cook up an entirely new plot than to continue where that story left off. Although ""Cloudy"" managed to remain emotionally grounded by an approval-seeking subplot between Flint (voiced by Bill Hader) and his dad (James Caan) at a certain point the story went almost completely off the rails as super-sized vittles overtook everything and Andy Sambergs character wound up stuck inside a giant rotisserie chicken. Those amused by that bonkers ""Little Shop of Horrors""-style sensibility will be delighted to find the sequel continues in the same vein starting with the larger-than-life cleanup job facing the town. Meanwhile fans of the originals heartfelt quality and the generally clever way it poked fun at disaster-movie tropes will find this outing less to their taste serving up what amounts to a gonzo riff on ""Jurassic Park"" as Flint and his friends contend with an island overrun by mutant creations. Instead of being humbled by the fact one of his inventions nearly destroyed the world Flint craves recognition as a first-class inventor. His idol the eerily Steve Jobs-like Chester V (Will Forte) exploits the creativity of others for the benefit of his soul-sucking Live Corp. which plans an iPhone-style product launch for its new Food Bar. (Surely a Monsanto-esque seed-monger have made for a better villain or wasnt that silly enough?) Chester V craves access to Flints FLDSMDFR -- the unwieldy acronym for the gizmo he invented that turns water into food. Assumed destroyed at the end of ""Cloudy"" the FLDSMDFR has actually grown more sophisticated spitting out an entire ecosystem of ""foodimals"" which the film argues deserve to live in peace. Why? Because theyre cute including such fun-to-identify creatures as the ""hippotatomus"" and ""fruit cockateil."" Yes a mutant ""cheespider"" (a giant burger with French fries for legs and dozens of evil sesame-seed eyes) can eat you but it also makes quite a nice pet if you just stop to scratch its buns. Logic doesnt really apply in this trippy universe where Flint now working for Chester V and his bossy orangutan Barb (Kristen Schaal) must track down his FLDSMDFR and insert a system-killing device. Co-directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn both served on the story team of the original ""Cloudy"" and though their follow-up shows reverence for the source (with larger roles for nearly all the supporting characters including a full-blown speaking part for cameraman Manny voiced by Benjamin Bratt) it also violates much of what that film -- and Judi and Ron Barretts classic picture book -- stood for. If ""Cloudy"" represented a worst-case scenario of what can happen when humans toy with nature the sequel argues that society shouldnt be too quick to dismiss the freaky results of genetic engineering shown here as a noble form of creativity. Put a smiley face on a marshmallow and you evidently have a new species worth saving. But try to grind that adorable creature up and serve it as food the way Chester V does and death could be too kind a fate for such craven capitalist behavior. Studios never tire of such hollow self-criticism slapping anti-consumerist messaging on films clearly designed to support a minor empire of product tie-ins. Now contrast this paradoxical subtext with the relatively selfless moral the Barretts preached on the page In their own childrens book sequel ""Pickles to Pittsburgh"" when faced with a mountain of leftovers the characters proceed to distribute the excess food to hungry communities around the world. Still the filmmakers see no imperative beyond the desire to entertain here. As weird as the world theyve created can be its ripe to the point of rupture in the imagination department. Where the previous film pushed technology to make everything look edible this one has concentrated less on texture than design inventing dozens of funky foodimals and a robust tropical environment for them to inhabit (plus the fictitious city of San Franjose where Live Corp.s hilarious HQ is based) gorgeously rendered in 3D. What Erica Rivinoja John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldsteins script lacks in lingering nutritional value it compensates for with amusing food puns. If nothing else the pics zany tone and manic pace are good for a quick-hit sugar high. Film Review Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2Reviewed at AMC Century City 15 Los Angeles Sept. 23 2013.

""Theres a leek in my boat"" exclaims his father Tim (James Caan) during the grand finale. Dropping the same joke twice in a 95 minute stretch? Its possible directors Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn didnt even notice as ""Cloudy 2"" barrels along faster than its spastic inventor on a caffeine binge. The 2009 original separated itself from the Pixar and Dreamworks competition with a joke-first approach. The sequel quadruples the recipe with gags on top of gags on top of gags in a way only animation could achieve. Like a foodie ""Jurassic Park"" conjured up by Tex Avery ""Cloudy 2"" is a sight to behold ... as long as your brain hasnt turned to mush by the halfway point. The movie picks up moments after the heartwarming conclusion of the first ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" where it quickly abandons any sense of character pacing or tension. After stopping a delectable natural disaster from wiping out his home of Swallow Falls Flint is ready to start a ""lab"" -- which sounds creepily like a polyamorous relationship on paper -- with his gal pal Sam (Anna Faris) Dad the local cop Earl (Terry Crews) the local bully Brent (Andy Samberg) and Sams cameraman Manny (Benjamin Bratt). Life plans are thrown out of whack when Flints childhood hero Chester V (Will Forte doing his best evil Steve Jobs impression) arrives to town to recruit the bright mind for his tech conglomerate LIVE Corp. Chester V moves Flint and the gang to San FranJose and his ulterior motives reveal themselves The innovating mogul wants the FLDSMDFR machine capable of producing any food out of a few drops of water for himself. But its stuck in the middle of an overcooked Swallow Falls and worse the exact location is stuck somewhere in Flints absent-minded brain. ""Cloudy 2"" isnt as successful as ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" but its ambitiously chasing the layered comedy established by the Zucker Bros.. The film stuffs word play in its main characters mouths as throwaway gags explode in the background ensuring that someone will always be laughing at something. And theyre not all food puns (those are more the cherries on top of cherries on top); straying from the photorealistic trend Cameron and Pearn stretch the elasticity of the cartoon Flint and Chester V to new lengths. As Flint builds crazy inventions adapted straight from an eight-year-olds crayon doodles -- Like the ""Celebratonator"" an explosive box full of rainbow paint and confetti -- hes reacting with flailing appendages and wide-eyed expression. Haders spaz scientist puts Robin Williams work in Flubber to shame. You know since we were all heralding that one. When Chester puts Flint in charge of returning to Swallow Falls to unearth the FLDSMDFR ""Cloudy 2"" evolves into a Jules Verne-style adventure movie and loses most of its steam. The place is overrun with animal/food hybrids with predictably groan-worthy names. Bananostriches Wildabeets Hippotatoes and flocks of Fruit Cockatiel run amok in the jungles of Flints hometown with most of the films journey dedicated to stumbling upon and naming the edible kingdom. The highlights are Barry an anthropomorphized strawberry who speaks adorable gibberish and a crew of fishing pickles who look suspiciously like the Google Android logo. Building off the frenetic sensibilities of the movies first half the exploration of this weird and wild world however stunningly realized by the animators feels dredged from the shallowest pools of the Internet. Characters move with the rigid mannerisms of GIFs emotion pops like a curated Buzzfeed list of adorable cats and all of it vanishes at the pace of a click on to the next set up before anything registers. ""Cloudy 2"" is as sharp as it can be while pandering to audiences with non-existent attention spans. Lacking an ounce of story ultimately diminishes the effects of the movies barrage of antics. The telling moment comes when embarrassed in front of the entire LIVE Corp development team Flint runs home for a pep talk from his Pa. What could have been a genuinely sweet moment is disrupted by a background stunt involving Flints pet monkey and a trick candle gone wrong. ""Cloudy 2"" cant settle down for one minute perhaps at the risk of losing its young audience. Thankfully theres Hader and Fortes natural ""Saturday Night Live"" that realizes itself in full under the guise of cartoon characters. Even when the two are bouncing from their underwear performing the nerdiest acrobatics above an electrified pool of water these two have chemistry. ""Cloudy 2"" starts ripe before rotting past the point of consumption. Its problem may be best explained by the Zucker Bros.. In their now-legendary ""15 Rules of Comedy"" they point to a type of failed joke called ""Straw Dummy."" ""Where the intended target is set up by the writer instead of real life. Even if the joke hits the target who cares?"" Thats ""Cloudy 2"" that starts off mining jokes from its dazzling environments and whacked out characters before shotgunning ideas at the wall in relentless fashion. There are lots of laughs and for a PG-rated animated comedy that might be enough of a miracle. But by the end the movie and the audience are overstuffed. Its a cinematic food coma.
