A helpful fellow con suggests that Libby serve her time then kill the SOB for real since she cant be tried for the same crime twice. I like the noir setup of Double Jeopardy and I love Libbys spa-like lockup where the lithe inmate spends quality time toning up in preparation for her superwomanly expedition -- to confront her evil husband and reclaim custody of her child. But everything else about this toothless thriller -- directed in a departure from the romanticism of his Driving Miss Daisy by Bruce Beresford (with particular attention to the atmospheric scenery of Washington state and New Orleans) -- feels like a strained reworking of The Fugitive. And that includes Tommy Lee Jones performance as a growly drawly drink-weakened parole officer who takes one look at dainty well-toned Libby and out of all his hard-boiled cases announces ""Im gonna have trouble with you."" Well of course he is This parolee has been weight-training and putting highlights in her hair and shes a mom. So look out buster.

Starring Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones. Directed by Bruce Beresford. (R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Double Jeopardy"" is a stew pot of standard story elements all thrown together. Its a revenge story a prison picture a womans film about a mama looking for her child and a tale of a wrongly accused convict. Its also a quasi-remake of ""The Fugitive"" that even brings back Tommy Lee Jones as the cop on the trail. Yet somehow the concoction is fresh. Theres something heartening about a film that aspires to do nothing but entertain -- and does. ""Double Jeopardy"" is a well-acted diversion directed by Bruce Beresford (""Driving Miss Daisy"") with an intelligent grasp of the moment-to-moment emotion. He has the advantage of a top-notch actress Ashley Judd in the lead role. In 1995 Judd blew a hole through ""Smoke"" in her one scene as Stockard Channings crack-addicted daughter. After that one might have expected her to be offered roles that capitalized on her intensity but her Hollywood career has been mostly bland. Until now her best showcase was a low-budget independent called ""Normal Life"" in which she played a violent neurotic. In ""Double Jeopardy"" Judd finally gets a chance to show what she can do. She plays Libby a married woman with a young son and a handsome husband (Bruce Greenwood) who is just a little too slick. He collects art. He smokes Cuban cigars. He smirks a lot and enjoys needling people. Greenwoods performance in the films opening minutes is a study in how a good actor can subtly manage to make an entire audience hate him while doing nothing overtly vicious. Things get interesting when Libby and hubby go out sailing. She falls asleep and wakes up covered in blood. Theres blood up the stairs and all over the deck and the husband is nowhere to be found. From the evidence of movies we can only assume that its the easiest thing in the world to cover a sleeping person in blood. I think Id wake up but then one does tend to get paranoid from watching thrillers. Just once though wouldnt it be interesting to see someone wake up while the other person is pouring the blood on -- just to hear what the conversation would be like? The title ""Double Jeopardy"" re fers to the clause in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution that states that no one can be tried twice for the same crime. Libby is convicted of murdering her husband but a month into her sentence she discovers that her husband staged the whole thing that he is alive and well and living in -- well where else would he go? -- San Francisco. She is understandably miffed but one thought consoles her Once she serves the time she can kill him and the government cant put her back in jail for it. The movie lives up to the neat setup. Libby wants revenge but mainly she wants to see her son. ""Double Jeopardy"" is not a particularly deep movie but Judd who spends most of the picture in a state of controlled frenzy makes it substantial. Her acting choices are always right and often unexpected She smiles when other actresses would not and stays still when another would emote. Always just beneath the surface is a fierceness. Judd can make an audience really believe that she wants something. ""Double Jeopardy"" contains Jones best performance since ""The Fugitive"" probably because he acts nothing like he did in ""The Fugitive."" Jones doesnt try to be flashy. He plays Libbys parole officer a sad sack under the rough exterior who drinks a lot. Without much indication from the script Jones not only keeps the audience clear on the process by which the parole officer comes to believe Libbys story but he also lets us understand that he needs to believe it even if we dont exactly know why. ..

"Double Jeopardy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; double-jeopardy ) Double Jeopardy (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli Towards the end of Double Jeopardy one individual threatens another ""Im gonna have you arrested for stupidity."" I wish someone had made a similar pronouncement to director Bruce Beresford and writers David Weisberg amp; Douglas Cook. In most cases Im willing to give a film a fair amount of latitude (especially a mystery/thriller which by its nature is likely to have a convoluted plot) provided that three criteria are met. First the characters must be interesting. Secondly the story must maintain a minimum level of credibility. Finally and most importantly the screenplay must not insult my intelligence. Double Jeopardy manages to fail in two of these three areas. The only point it meets is the ""interesting character"" one and thats in large part because Ashley Judd is a good enough actress to be able to bring something to an on-screen personality that isnt in the script. The premise despite being somewhat implausible is nevertheless intriguing. A woman Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) is arrested for killing her husband Nick (Bruce Greenwood). The two leave together for a weekend trip on a sailboat but when the coast guard answers a distress call all they find is a bloodsoaked Libby. Her trial does not go well and she is convicted. However while in jail she learns that her husband is not dead. With a new identity he has taken her son and money and left Washington State. Once she is out on parole she begins searching for Nick with her parole officer Lehman (played by Tommy Lee Jones in full Fugitive mode) hot on her heels. And when she finds him she has one big thing going for her. Because the Fifth Amendment does not allow a person to be tried more than once for one crime (the situation is called ""double jeopardy"") and she has already served time for Nicks murder she can execute him with impunity. If made for a thoughtful audience Double Jeopardy could have been a powerful motion picture examining issues like justice and revenge. How would any of us react if we suddenly discovered that we had the power of life and death over the person who had wronged us the most grievously? Unfortunately this movie is too focused on action melodrama and plot twists to allow for more than a moments intelligence to worm its way into the script. Double Jeopardy piles implausibility upon implausibility until its dubious foundation begins to crack under the pressure. Willing suspension of disbelief gets thrown out the window. And not only is the storyline impossible to swallow but the characters all act like they have been victims of some sort of degenerative brain disease. Critics love to mock horror movie scream queens for their stupidity but some of those girls are geniuses compared to the men and women populating this movie. No one here acts in ways that make sense; they do dumb things just so they can be placed in danger. And even an inattentive audience will be at least a couple of steps ahead of them. Ashley Judd almost makes Libby credible. In fact the actress is so good that against all odds we like the character even though she only uses about 1% of her brain cells. Its not difficult to understand why Judd would accept this role Libby is a strong female character who doesnt need a man to save her. Its less clear why Tommy Lee Jones agreed to appear here. He isnt given much to do nor is his character well developed. Maybe the writers expected us to mentally graft the personality of Sam Gerard (from The Fugitive and U.S. Marshals) onto Lehman. The third main actor Bruce Greenwood is also much better than the material. Greenwood will not be familiar to most American viewers but he is a well-respected Canadian character actor who has had key parts in Atom Egoyans Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter (he played a grieving father in both films). Filmmaker Bruce Beresford has an uneven resume. For every Driving Miss Daisy or Paradise Road theres a Her Alibi or A Good Man in Africa. Its almost as if Beresford accepts a job based on a fascinating premise without considering whether the script does it justice. There are some nice things about Double Jeopardy. In addition to Judd the cinematography (by Peter James) is impressive whether its of gorgeous mountain vistas or rainy New Orleans streets. But this doesnt amount to a good reason to see a mostly bad movie. By sticking to the familiar lobotomized thriller formula Double Jeopardy too often fails to arrest anyones attention.

With a straight-ahead no-nonsense approach to match its stars ""Double Jeopardy"" is single-minded and engaging thriller storytelling without an afterglow. Though hardly an original stroke ""The Rock"" co-scenarists David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook turn the old ""Death Wish"" revenge fantasy formula on its head by making a strong woman the rooting interest to get justice by any means necessary. In the first studio project in which shes front and center throughout Ashley Judd makes her woman scorned an impressive star turn that is equal measures sinewy determinedly focused and graceful a yin to Tommy Lee Jones patented gruff yang as the parole officer tracking her down. Utterly pro and ideally cast in major roles pic delivers action but few surprises to generate the kind of buzz needed to fill cinemas for many weeks through a busy fall season. Paramount should expect respectable but not dazzling numbers in theatrical phase with a nifty chase to major coin later in vid. Judds rise to stardom is the most interesting element here and while this marks her second standard-issue thriller in a row after the forgettable ""Kiss the Girls"" current pic is both a better example of the genre and offers the versatile thesp a far greater challenge which she grabs and literally runs with. While Judd has yet to find the ideal role for her to balance an almost startling intelligence with a physical power unusual among her peers this yarn gives her plenty of scenery to chew and blow away. Direction by Bruce Beresford is so unassumingly assured that it barely registers that the thriller is a marked change of pace from his more humanistic character-driven projects. Script though serves up some nice character business and humor from the outset when Libby (Judd) is enjoying a fund-raiser party thrown at her and hubby Nicks (Bruce Greenwood) awesome Whidbey Island Wash. pad. She yearningly looks at a sailboat with 4-year-old son Matty (Benjamin Weir) not realizing that spendthrift Nick has bought one for her. A seemingly throwaway party moment as Nick wittily explains to a clueless yuppie couple about his cherished originals by the father of abstract painting Wassily Kandinsky hints at a slightly smarter-than-average thriller and proves to be crucial to plotline. Hints are dropped that Nicks in hot financial water and that marriage is shaky but couple seems sexy and happy as they take boat out for a spin. Hours after lovemaking however Libby wakes in a blood-stained bed and finds blood on everything including a knife -- but no Nick. On cue the Coast Guard appears as Libby holds the knife. Despite a positively Jackie O.-like appearance and a convincingly emotional speech on the witness stand with curiously little effort expended by her defense attorney Bobby (Jay Brazeau) Libby is convicted of murder. Believing shes placing Matty in good hands with family friend Angie (Annabeth Gish) Libby gives her custody of the child but loses contact with either of them once shes behind bars. Chase is essentially on even during incarceration when Libby takes tips from ex-lawyer inmate Margaret (Roma Maffia) on how she can get an address for Angie. Libbys phone call throws off Angie as Nick arrives at her San Francisco home just as Matty is talking to Mom who now realizes that shes been framed and starts working out like shes in Olympic trials for the Revenge event. Though title refers to w.k. legal dictum which prevents a previously convicted person of being charged with same crime a second time this is apparently news to Libby as Margaret fills her in on the not-very-startling business which means that Nick can be murdered sans punishment. In the typically ultra-tidy style of this narrative Libby gets paroled with no problem after doing six years and not looking worse for the wear. Parole officer Travis (Jones) is all business as Libby soon observes even as she learns that Travis himself was jerked around by his former spouse and is separated from his own child. This doesnt stop Libby from going back to Whidbey Island and pilfering files at Angies school for her latest address. Short but gripping chase by cops over island dunes puts Libby back in Travis grasp but not for long as she is able to make a watery escape. Its ""Fugitive"" time again for Jones and while he looks a bit like an actor wondering if hes having deja vu all over again he injects every scene during a lengthy pursuit from the Northwest to New Orleans with a wry ironic wit. This is all new though for Judd who looks and acts pumped for action just eluding her pursuer every step of the way. Kandinsky again pops up in the plot for a key and clever twist in an amusing art gallery scene that has energy of best moments from the ""Lethal Weapon"" series contrasted with some elegant noirish touches as Libby ingeniously crashes a gala New Orleans affair to finally confront an embarrassed Nick. After a long absence from story Greenwoods bad guy takes center stage and imbues pic with an oily presence that this excellent Canadian thesp clearly enjoys. Disturbing Libby-Nick encounter in rotting city cemetery leads to the feisty damsel locked in a coffin with a corpse from which of course she finds an escape. Travis finally puts two and two together and realizing that Libby has been innocent all along helps turn the tables on Nick in the kind of parlor scene Sidney Greenstreet might have relished. Judd Jones and Greenwood deserve more than this crafted but basic paint-by-numbers thriller vehicle but they are by no means slumming their way through. Beresford is less interested in visual razzle-dazzle than in staging the heavily plotted story as handsomely as possible. But despite fine casting and the consistently pro approach familiarity sets in and lack of surprises directly lessen what could have been emotionally gripping. Vivid Brit Columbia locales stand in for Washington setting. This incidentally raises an interesting retrospective plot question about why Nick and Angie didnt simply flee to nearby Canada making it infinitely harder for Libby to track them down. Craftsmanlike credits include a stately score from Canadian composer Normand Corbeil and pretty lensing care of regular Beresford d.p. Peter James.

A helpful fellow con suggests that Libby serve her time then kill the SOB for real since she cant be tried for the same crime twice. I like the noir setup of Double Jeopardy and I love Libbys spa-like lockup where the lithe inmate spends quality time toning up in preparation for her superwomanly expedition - to confront her evil husband and reclaim custody of her child. But everything else about this toothless thriller - directed in a departure from the romanticism of his ""Driving Miss Daisy"" by Bruce Beresford (with particular attention to the atmospheric scenery of Washington state and New Orleans) - feels like a strained reworking of ""The Fugitive."" And that includes Tommy Lee Jones performance as a growly drawly drink-weakened parole officer who takes one look at dainty well-toned Libby and out of all his hard-boiled cases announces ""Im gonna have trouble with you."" Well of course he is This parolee has been weight-training and putting highlights in her hair and shes a mom. So look out buster.
