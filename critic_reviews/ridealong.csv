By David Denby Tom Schilling in a miniseries made for German TV about the Second World War.   Credit Illustration By Concepcion Studios At the beginning of the ambitious German television miniseries ""Generation War"" five young friends (three men and two women) dance and drink in a Berlin bar. The time is June 1941. Two of the men are heading to the Eastern Front but the Fuhrer has promised that the war will be over by Christmas and the mood is charged even celebratory. ""The whole world lay before us. We just had to take it"" one of the men says narrating. Four years (and four and a half hours) later after Germanys defeat the survivors reassemble in the same bar. The bookends pull the series together but the banality of the device is almost comical. ""Generation War"" (originally titled ""Our Mothers Our Fathers"") was a sensational success in Germany and Austria when it aired there last year. It depicts an enormous range of experience vicious combat with the Red Army ambushes life in wartime hospitals moments of shock and disillusionment. Yet it depends on the conventions of soap opera and popular melodrama (is a soldier hit with machine-gun fire really still alive?) and some of it comes close to inanity. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 with more than three million men yet these five people keep bumping into one another on the Eastern Front as if they were crisscrossing a large fairground. ""Generation War"" has the strengths and the weaknesses of middlebrow art it may be clunky but its never dull and once you start watching you cant stop. Commissioned by the German television company ZDF (headquartered in Mainz) the series has been picked up by Music Box Films for theatrical release in this country as a two-part movie; an airing on a cable network is also planned. The director Philipp Kadelbach and the writer Stefan Kolditz have said that their intention was to start a dialogue with Germans who lived through the war. That idea might have made more sense a decade or so ago when there were more people left to talk to. Its a little late now for this film to serve as the basis of a moral conversation. Still better late than never I suppose. The filmmakers have produced a collective portrait of a generation Wilhelm (Volker Bruch) stern and responsible is a lieutenant in the Wehrmacht; he squares his jaw and does his duty. His bookish kid brother Friedhelm (Tom Schilling) serves in the same unit but he hates war and mutters bitter asides between battles. The brothers are fond of Greta (Katherina Schuttler) a singer who wants to be the next Marlene Dietrich and her lover Viktor (Ludwig Trepte) a Jewish tailor who has managed to get by in Berlin a relatively liberal city where anti-Semitism is not as virulent as elsewhere in Germany. The fifth member of the group is Charlotte called Charly (Miriam Stein) an ardent and idealistic nurse. She and Wilhelm are in love but are afraid to tell each other. (Really? In wartime young people tend not to be so hesitant.) Except for Viktor they all do terrible things. The brothers take part in executions; Charly betrays someone who trusted her; Greta sleeps with a loathsome S.S. officer first to protect Viktor then to boost her career. ""Generation War"" has been much praised in Germany for its sense of accountability. The old accepted notion that the barbarians were confined to the S.S. and the Gestapo has been cast aside. The series acknowledges what scholars have established in recent years that the Wehrmacht played a major role in committing atrocities in the occupied countries. ""Generation War"" doesnt center on the war against Jews and other minorities but the Holocaust has been widely discussed in Germany and maybe this time the focus can be elsewhere. There are however other omissions and silences. Aside from Viktor the characters are fervently patriotic but not ideological. They are surrounded by the S.S. yet none of them become committed Nazis. They are meant to be overwhelmingly young--a little foolish not terribly perceptive and essentially innocent. Is this a convincing picture of educated Berlin youths in 1941? By the time the story begins the Nazis have advanced across Europe invaded the Soviet Union and killed Jews by the thousands in occupied lands. Jews have been disappearing even in Berlin. While destroying one myth the filmmakers have built up another. The movie says that young men and women were seduced and then savagely betrayed--brutalized by what the Nazis and the war itself put them through. Their complicity in this account is forced never chosen. Aimed at todays Germans who would like perhaps to come to a final reckoning with the war period ""Generation War"" is an appeal for forgiveness. But the movie sells dubious innocence in the hope of eliciting reconciliation. That said the depiction of war is detailed raw and often moving. Kadelbach uses newsreel footage and the grimy blurred images of blitzkrieg and retreat are incomparable as an evocation of force and panic. After each newsreel segment Kadelbach picks up with the brothers Wehrmacht unit. He knits together scenes of staged fighting with much greater coherence than the directors of the American TV series ""Band of Brothers"" did especially in an attack on a fixed Soviet position in a rubble-strewn street which may be the best representation of close combat ever filmed. Kadelbach has a tactile feeling for terrain weather and the everyday horrors of a soldiers life. When not fighting the Red Army Wilhelm and Friedhelm miserably do the criminal work of killing Russian civilians and Polish partisans. American viewers wondering how we might have responded under such extreme pressure will regard these Germans with intense curiosity What did they think they were doing? What happened to them? Friedhelm a virtual noncombatant at first suffers an internal collapse (""You resist the temptation to be human"" he says) and turns into a cold-eyed killer who no longer cares whether he lives or dies. The disillusionment of his disciplined brother Wilhelm is more complicated. Disgusted and increasingly rebellious Wilhelm goes AWOL for a while. He tries to survive morally as well as physically. Does this portrait amount to special pleading for a Wehrmacht officer? While re-creating the vast swing of German forces in and out of Russia Kadelbach tries to capture the inner turmoil of two men. Call it half a victory. Viktor guided by a mixture of caution and opportunism holes up with partisans in the Polish countryside. His improbable adventures make for a good story but he doesnt get the in-depth treatment given the other men. And the womens roles get pushed into cliche. Katherina Schuttlers singer carrying on with her S.S. officer looks merely deluded to us and I wish she hadnt taken a knowing drag on a cigarette after sleeping with her man--the mark of a fallen woman that goes back to the silents. Charly an example of blooming German maidenhood comes off as stupid; her blunders serve to advance the plot not to illuminate the character. If only the filmmakers had realized that the most cataclysmic of wars required more than hackneyed TV drama. What we get is confounding--both silly and tragic physically alive and morally obtuse. In the hit comedy ""Ride Along"" Kevin Hart and Ice Cube are just funny enough to make audiences forgive some of the most careless moviemaking in the long history of thrown-together commercial packages. Hart is a video-game champ who wants to marry his girlfriend (Tika Sumpter) the sister of a veteran Atlanta police detective played by Ice Cube. The detective tests his would-be brother-in-law by putting him through a hellish day of police work and they become buddies or something like it. The plot is so lame and derivative that it keeps stumbling even as farce bad guys get caught in a huge explosion and then pop up again later the same day; the heavy-browed Bruce McGill plays a police chief whose lines seem to have been recycled from a seventies cop show. Nothing in the movie makes sense but I prefer to think that ""Ride Along"" is just a badly told joke rather than an insult to its audience. Maybe next time the director Tim Story will go over the edge into parody. He doesnt at the moment have much talent for shoot-outs and chases though hes good at milking these two actors for what they can do. Ice Cube has a stare as deadly as a meat cleaver and speech so precise that it seems etched; he has a good slow burn and a gift for tirade. Hart hops around him like an overanxious terrier chattering falling recovering. Like a lot of young comics he teases male infantilism and stud swagger but he does it faster than anyone since Eddie Murphy in his early days. The movies success will no doubt yield between two and eight sequels. It would be nice to see the talent put to better use but I wouldnt count on it.

His chance arrives when his girlfriends brother - hard-ass Atlanta cop James (Ice Cube giving a masterclass in the art of the contemptuous look) - offers him the chance of a ride along a Training Day-style one-day immersion into high-level crimebusting. If Ben impresses James will grant him permission to propose to his sister of whom he is fiercely protective. Director Tim Story (Fantastic Four) locates the right blend of humour and action in a couple of taut sequences but Ride Along is saddled with an uninvolving plot and largely content to coast on cop-movie cliches. It leans heavily on Hart for laughs but his manic flailing irritates more often than it amuses. Plenty here stretches credibility but nothing rings less true than the unalloyed embodiment of male fantasy that is Bens girlfriend (Tika Sumpter) who is endlessly supportive of her beaus juvenile antics and permanently sexually desirous of him. Ride Along also peddles some extremely dubious messages the most worrying of which is the suggestion that playing violent video games - as Ben does - is ultimately the most effective police training.

Photo Quantrell D. Colbert Universal Pictures Ride Along review Hart Ice Cube in formulaic cop film 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Ride Along Action comedy. Starring Kevin Hart Ice Cube and Tika Sumpter. Directed by Tim Story. (PG-13. 100 minutes.) ""Ride Along"" is such a formula effort - so much what they call ""high concept"" - that you might be able to get the same effect imagining it as watching it. Just lower the lights get into a comfortable chair and contemplate Kevin Hart and Ice Cube riding together in a police car ... a fast-talking funny guy and a slow-talking surly guy ... not liking each other ... yet slowly bonding ... as they go after a major mob boss. Thirty years ago this movie was called ""48 Hrs."" Fifteen years ago it was called ""Rush Hour."" It has been called about 50 other things since but you can have the whole experience free by just thinking about it and your version will be just as good as this one. Yet funny thing about movie formulas - they dont arise because theyre repulsive. They arise because they have an inherent appeal and so in its humble way does ""Ride Along."" At times watching Hart and Ice Cube step into these roles is like watching some secular version of a Passion play or Nativity cycle some endlessly repeatable archetypal thing in which the actors are temporal and interchangeable and the tradition is all that matters. Or better yet its like watching some opera that youve seen so many times that theres no suspense over whether Violetta survives consumption or not. No the only suspense is whether the soprano will go for the high note at the end of Act 1. Those are the real questions What kind of soprano is Kevin Hart? What kind of baritone is Ice Cube? And the most truthful answer is friendly but unexciting Theyre OK. Theyre pretty good. ""Ride Along"" was directed by Tim Story who was also responsible for ""Think Like a Man"" the 2012 movie that really launched Hart as a comic actor. Here Hart is Ben who plays video games all day and works as a security guard. Newly accepted into the Atlanta police academy he hopes soon to have enough money to marry his girlfriend (Tika Sumpter). But he also wants the respect and blessing of her brother James a big tough police detective played by Ice Cube. Most of ""Ride Along"" takes place over the course of one long day in which Ben goes on a ""ride along"" with James. Ben wants to prove that he has what it takes to be a police officer and James hopes to scare him off. Why? Well James just doesnt like him. But then things start happening - things easily imagined but why give them away? The movie has no bad scenes and one good one an extended one in which Laurence Fishburne shows up as the most dangerous man in Atlanta looking amused floating through the role and letting his presence do the rest. As for everything else in the movie Hart is funny but he has something besides humor. He seems like a sensitive feeling person driven somehow. This underlying quality doesnt get much of a workout here but its a presence a hint something giving body to the movies empty form. And in one or two scenes particularly in the opener Ice Cube reminds us of what was apparent from ""Boyz N the Hood"" many years ago. Hes a fine dramatic actor or could be if he ever appeared in dramas. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Dumpuary Movie Report The Naked Awfulness of That Awkward Moment Ride Along and Labor Day << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Dumpuary Movie Report The Naked Awfulness of That Awkward Moment Ride Along and Labor Day Movies January 31 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print When bad movies end with a blooper reel youre supposed to think This is how much worse it could have been But really blooper reels add insult to injury. Youre forced to acknowledge that someone actually was in charge of the dull moronic mess you just watched. Remaining seated becomes a forensic opportunity So this is how this was so bad. That Awkward Moment is bad but its scarcely the worst. It wants to be one of those we-had-a-deal comedies in which the characters agree to participate in or abstain from some sexual or romantic rite with Seinfelds ""master of your domain"" masturbation pact being the landmark of the genre. At some point someone says ""I thought we had a deal"" The friendships fracture for a couple of scenes (or one long montage). Then coincidence or a ""one year later"" tag heals all. A moderately smart movie would have pushed back against the formula. That Awkward Moment simply mistakes being obnoxious for being clever. Here three Manhattan friends (played by Michael B. Jordan Zac Efron and Miles Teller) mutually agree to stay single but just wind up closeting their romantic commitments. Even by the loose standards of bromantic comedy these are outrageously low stakes. Jordans doctor comes home one day to a request for divorce. He wants to fight for the marriage but his two buddies -- they design ""chick lit"" book covers -- want him to give up so he can seduce and carouse with them. Whats the price for violating the pact? Whats its point? Its that dudes have to be dudes and being a dude means going home with a girl you meet at a bar -- as Ephron does with Imogen Poots -- and trying to sneak out of her apartment because the thigh-high boots envelopes of cash and copy of Story of O in her bedroom spell prostitute. (Not only does Pootss character show up a scene or two later as a prospective author in need of book-jacket design shes also the sort of character who when Efron explains why he left still continues to date him. Id love to see the movie in which she sits down for brunch and tries explaining that to her girlfriends.) The movie is going for a kind of Taming of the Douche. But none of the three stars is really up to the task. To Jordans credit hes playing the one least interested in being a jerk. Hes got a swaggering sweetness that makes the characters refusal to give up interesting. You just dont believe the movies version of the situation. Its as if writer-director Tom Gormican heard that people get divorced and sleep around but has no idea what making either funny entails. Anyway when he gets to play confident Jordan seems unstoppable. All the sexiness Efron keeps trying for Jordan has coming out of his eyelashes. Efron has become a pleasure to watch. Hes Shia LaBeouf without the hot air and fifth shot of espresso. He just lacks the threat that can turn his hotness into danger. He might never get to Christian Bale in American Psycho or Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street. In this movie he gets to be profane and pump his front into a womans rear. But as an immoral star hes still only a Disney Family-level asshole. Teller plays the most maladroit of the three. He softens the misogyny by treating it as something less galling. When a gentleman comes on to the friend (Mackenzie Davis) his character will spend the rest of the movie secretly sleeping with he says ""You can tame her with tequila and compliments."" The insults gush from him as they do from Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill. Teller is also unusual looking yet happens to be a better handsomer actor who can give the offensiveness a psychological changeup. Rogen and Hill project. Teller performs. As actors these three have little to do with each other. I was curious to see a movie attempt to harmonize them. To some extent Gormican manages it but the result just ends up being New Girl but limp. That Awkward Moment plays with the cliche of pricks being princes in need of a princess. But Im not sure the movie even believes that to be true. Its both too cynical and too cute. One scene sees Efron and Teller present a new book design explaining that women will buy any book with shoes on the cover and one of the women in the room blurts out ""I love it."" Only in this fantasy would a woman say that. Only in this fantasy would bromance skip romantic comedy and shoot straight for dick lit.  Ride Along doesnt end with a blooper reel -- just more movie. Its like an overflowing toilet. But for two weeks its been at the top of the American box office. This means there will really be no living with Kevin Hart who was last seen being swatted away by the stars of Grudge Match. Even though this time its Ice Cube doing the swatting the movie is all Harts. He squeaks and screams and talks the way Usain Bolt runs. In a big ensemble comedy -- Think Like a Man for instance or BETs Real Husbands of Hollywood -- his humiliated mock outrage works because youre not stuck with him. Given how big a hit Ride Along appears to be we all are now. Hart plays a do-nothing whos been accepted into Atlantas police academy and needs the approval of his fiancees brother before they can get married. The brother happens to be Ice Cube a detective who cant stand him and drags Hart to work to scare him out of both police work and marriage. Needless to say the plot twists and Hart proves accidentally invaluable. The movies lousiness comes directly from its slap-together laziness (Tim Story directed; four credited writers typed). It could have been the farce of Training Day. Instead the whole thing leans on Ice Cubes scowl and Harts eagerness to please. Meanwhile as Harts girlfriend Tika Sumpter is meant to be a vision of tolerance and well just a vision. She spends the climax as a damsel in workout shorts and a top and seems -- here anyway -- to have arrived from the Kerry Washington-Zoe Saldana-Gabrielle Union bougie-beauty factory. Also here thanklessly are John Leguizamo Bryan Callen and Laurence Fishburne who actually bothers trying to give a performance. Its bad but its something. All the while Hart is jumping up and down not listening causing trouble. You dont know whether to put him in another movie or a timeout. He and Ice Cube bring nothing out of each other. The movie is one of those Coors Light ads in which Ice Cube gets frosted by an inanimate can of sassy beer. Now the beer is Hart who as a comedian has been begging for Hollywoods attention for five years. He has it now but youve got to believe he can do better than this.  I walked by posters for That Awkward Moment and Ride Along and looked around the theater lobby waiting for someone to say ""Just kidding"" Jason Reitmans Labor Day is 111 minutes of a ""just kidding"" that never arrives. I saw the movie first last fall (and wrote about it then) and remain astonished by its earnestness and ludicrousness. Josh Brolin escapes from prison and holds Kate Winslet and her teenage son (Gattlin Griffith) hostage in her stately New England home. Were meant to find this scenario mysterious but it turns laughable fast. At some point Winslet complains about her bowl of spoiled peaches and Brolin suggests making dessert. And so these two and the boy stand together mixing peach filling their hands sloshing in the same bowl. You can believe Reitman was drawn to the colors of Joyce Maynards 2009 novel especially all the purple prose and the opportunity to toy with flashbacks. But the information in the flashbacks is so obvious that they turn the movie into camp. But Labor Day is too dreary for camp. Its dramp. The whole film operates on a level of foolishness thats impossible to sit through with a straight face. Some of the embarrassment arises from terrible performances. Winslet can play confused. But she spends the film in a coma of bewilderment. Its probably easier to pretend youre asleep than to be tied to a chair or doing that pie sequence. This is no part for a good actor. This is no part for anybody. It barely works on the page. The rest of the embarrassment comes from how peculiarly personal this movie feels. Reitman adapted Maynards book himself and whatever he saw in it never materializes on the screen. The result is a gauzy almost unreleasable movie thats detached from its warmth.

This routine buddy picture offers plenty of instant gratification (Cube and Hart are easygoing screen presences and many of their one-liners are funny) but shows little concern for characterization storytelling or even comic pacing.

Daily Edition Login to download Ride Along Film Review 900 AM PST 1/15/2014 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A familiar appealing cast and frantic action keep this franchise-ready film hitting on all cylinders. TWITTER Ice Cube Kevin Hart Tika Sumpter and John Leguizamo co-star in Universals new action comedy. Kevin Hart and Ice Cube take on a bad cop-wannabe scenario in Tim Storys Ride Along which turns out to be something like a comic riff on Training Day. Leaning more toward Harts brand of slightly raunchy humor rather than Ice Cubes equally popular family-friendly fare the PG-13 film exhibits broad appeal backed by a wide-ranging marketing campaign. With an opening timed for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend and lacking any similar action-comedy competition the release could score big for Universal in major markets. Ben Barber (Kevin Hart) is a video game-obsessed high school security guard whos inexplicably landed in the good graces of super-cute girlfriend Angela (Tika Sumpter). Ben plans on proposing just about any time but the problem is that Angies brother hardcore undercover Atlanta police officer James Payton (Ice Cube) is completely paranoid about protecting his younger sisters welfare after the years they spent in foster homes growing up. STORY Hollywood Fix the 2014 Movie Calendar Ben thinks hes found the ideal solution when hes accepted for police academy training expecting James to welcome him into the family but his new career opportunity makes little impression and Ben remains unable to obtain the irascible cops approval. Then James hits on a scheme he thinks will definitively discourage Ben saying hell give the wannabe cop a chance to prove hes really police department material by surviving a ride-along in James department-issued muscle car. ""Youve got one day and one day only to show me what you got"" James tells him. Ben jumps at the chance to show his worth although he quickly begins to wonder if hes made the best choice when hes plunged into Jamess slightly sketchy investigation of a local gun-running crime lord. Working behind the scenes with junior officers Santiago (John Leguizamo) and Miggs (Bryan Callen) James sets Ben up for a day of embarrassing pranks typically played on rookie cops. The series of incidents proves repeatedly humiliating for Ben but the odd thing is that he keeps turning up clues on James investigation of Serbian arms dealers and a developing plot to supply one of Atlantas most nefarious criminals. Deploying a conspicuously broad brand of humor and just about every buddy-cop movie convention at its disposal the screenwriting team of Greg Coolidge Jason Mantzoukas Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi exploits Bens desperation for easy repetitive gags that nonetheless elicit a fair amount of laughs due mainly to the charisma of the principal performers. As the weary veteran cop intent on cracking a big case and shaking off his lame sidekick Ice Cube exudes the requisite scorn for his would-be partner constantly setting him up and putting him down with a sneer and a chuckle. Cubes comic timing cant be faulted but he doesnt appear to muster much enthusiasm for the role relying more on his well-worn persona than a real commitment to the performance. The same cant be said for Hart who over-commits in a big way but grabs the majority of laughs for his outrageous over-reaching and self-ridicule. If anything its all a bit excessive and intentionally so although its a technique that begins to show some wear midway through the film. One of Harts greatest assets is his nonstop motor-mouth and the screenwriters give him plenty of opportunities to spew utterly inane statements and commit outrageous blunders. The running gag associating Bens skill at military-themed video games and his ability to identify exotic weaponry gets plenty of mileage and remains well-integrated with the main plot. STORY Todd McCarthy Names the 10 Best Films of 2013 Supporting castmembers register solidly although talented Tika Sumpter doesnt have much to do other than sitting pretty until the bad guys inevitably show up. Leguizamo has a nice turn as James semi-psycho subordinate and Callen is suitably standoffish as the police departments oft-put-upon lieutenant. Since the films largely schematic subplot about Serbian gunrunners cant manage much in the way of originality its fortunate that Story knows his way around a comedy. Together with the screenwriters he keeps the jokes and gags coming at a furious clip most of which land nicely thanks to the leads skilled timing. The rapport between Story and his Think Like a Man actor pays dividends here as Hart ramps up his routine to a near-manic level. With Universal already planning a Ride Along 2 hopefully the holiday weekend turnout manages to fulfill the studios expectations regarding the films early promise.

"Ride Along - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Ride Along Posted by Christy Lemire on January 20 2014 5 Comments Universal Pictures Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence sexual content and brief strong language. Running time 100 minutes. One star out of four. ""Ride Along"" has the dubious distinction of being simultaneously shoddy and straining lazy and desperate. Its a comedy thats never funny with action thats never thrilling. Director Tim Storys film is so addled with mismatched-buddy-cop cliches its actually hard to tell whether theyre intended as homage or parody -- or perhaps it was just easier to wallow in gags that are familiar and safe rather than coming up with an original idea. (It took four whole people to cobble together the screenplay. Count em.) One thing is for certain A little bit of Kevin Hart goes a long way. The quick-talking diminutive comic was actually the best part of Storys 2012 comedy ""Think Like a Man"" -- but then again he was a member of an ensemble where his manic shtick was enjoyable in small sporadic doses. Here hes exhausting appearing  in nearly every frame opposite Ice Cube as the scowling straight man. All traces of Cubes innate likability -- which Story made the most of when he directed him in the amiable ""Barbershop"" way back in 2002 -- have been scrubbed away. The two characters are supposed to clash but that would require chemistry of some sort. Harts Ben is a high school security guard with dreams of glory as a police officer. He also dreams of marrying his girlfriend the beautiful Angela (Tika Sumpter) but first must acquire the approval of Angelas brother James (Cube) the toughest detective in all of Atlanta. (Sumpters character by the way is little more than an idea; smart-alecky and oversexed shes required to run around in cleavage-baring blouses tight tank tops and itty-bitty shorts but has no discernible life or career outside of Ben. And the fact that she feels compelled to defer to her brother about a major life decision like marriage seems especially archaic in this day and age.) Having just been accepted into the police academy Ben feels like hes practically a cop already. Eager to prove himself to James both personally and professionally hes all-too happy to go on a ride-along with the veteran officer. (The movie at least has the decency to acknowledge that its premise will remind you of the far superior ""Training Day."") But James -- with the help of two of his colleagues (John Leguizamo and Bryan Callen) -- hopes to make life on the mean streets look as unappealing as possible dragging Ben along to only the most annoying time-sucking calls. At the same time though James is trying to do legitimate investigative work looking into a suspected illegal arms deal involving a bunch of generically villainous Serbian bad guys. (Bruce McGill is underused in a couple of scenes as James stock disapproving lieutenant.) This brings us to the only truly clever idea ""Ride Along"" has to offer Because Ben spends so much of his free time playing a ""Call of Duty""-style first-person shooter video game hes inordinately knowledgeable about the various types of high-powered weaponry. So by sheer accident he helps James sniff out the criminals and uncover their plan. But mostly Ben blathers and bumbles repeatedly and gratingly. There isnt a moment of surprise here. The second Ben picks up a shotgun at a shooting range for example you know the kick will blast him to the back wall and you know James will react with a groan. Youll find yourself groaning again and again too -- but perhaps no more so than when Ice Cube quotes one of his most famous songs when he quips at the films conclusion ""Today was a good day."" Presumably saying ""Fuck tha police"" while apt also would have made a PG-13 rating impossible. Tweet Category Reviews Tags action Atlanta Bruce McGill buddy cop comedy Ice Cube John Leguizamo Kevin Hart Tika Sumpter Tim Story 5 Comments on ""Ride Along"" January 20 2014  by  Christian Toto     Ugh. Would love to see Hart and Ice Cube in a different movie with a script that wasnt dashed off as quickly as this movies must have been. They have comic potential but its wasted here in scene after scene. Yet the Cubes business instincts remain sound given the box office tally. His ability to make movies on a modest budget is something other Hollywood talent should notice and emulate. Reply January 25 2014  by  You know who i am     Ride along is a great funny movie with adult humor. With the role of ice cube having a serious but funny personality. Kevin hart is a gpod man too. Kevan hart has many great lines in the movie but always seeming to be flying. Reply January 20 2014  by  Anonymous     I love Kevin Hart but this movie didnt look very funny or intersting. Ah January you and your movies... Reply February 7 2014  by  m9decai     Didnt care for the reviewers commentary on Angela sounds like in real life she would talk down about a woman who is devoted to her man and wants to raise a family more than joining the rat race and becoming a feminist. Yes reviewer strong powerful women like Angela still exist in the world today they are the ones who raise strong intelligent men and women. That becomes their job. Reply April 15 2014  by  Tashtego     Thanks m9decai I just barfed in my mouth a little. Folksy platitudes just dont agree with my stomach.

Ride Along (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Ride Along (R) Funnyman Kevin Hart works hard to keep you laughing through this predictable cop comedy. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com1/16/2014 Editor rating 2 Kevin Harts mouth is the sole reason for the existence of the by-the-numbers buddy comedy Ride Along which rises and falls on the strength of his chattery comic delivery. Unfortunately theres more falling than rising though thats not all Harts fault. Hes undoubtedly a funny guy but he cant quite carry an entire feature film. Hes better in smaller doses (watch his hilarious performance in the ensemble comedy Think Like a Man and see if you dont agree). In Ride Along his schtick gets more camera time and it wears thin much less quickly than you might think. But its the only foundation propping up the movie which is delivered with all the subtlety of a motorcycle crashing through a plate-glass window or a truck flying through the flames of an explosion (both of these things actually happen in the films opening sequence but you are welcome to pick any of the other action movie cliches herein to illustrate my point). Hart plays school security guard Ben a gamer who has decided to translate his skills at shooting digital bad guys in Fallujah to a paying job. He has been accepted at the police academy in Atlanta and hopes to become a cop and then propose to his live-in girlfriend Angela (Tika Sumpter in the traditionally thankless role). The problem? Her brother James (Ice Cube) is a detective -- a no-nonsense bad team member I-dont-play-by-the-rules sort of detective if you can imagine such a thing -- and he doesnt approve of Ben who badly wants his blessing. James has no intention of bestowing it and hits on a perfect way to punish Ben and maybe even make him rethink his choice of career Invite him along for a day on the job set up several scenarios that will make Ben look like an idiot and hope he shuts up once and for all. Ben doesnt shut up of course and theres some fun to be had watching Hart try to solve every problem on the street by jabbering at it. Watching him attempt to fire a shotgun at a shooting range is amusing too even though you know exactly what will happen. But the film also sets up a dull convoluted plot about James trying to solve a case involving Serbians and arms dealing and a mysterious criminal mastermind named Omar who has plans to take over the city (or something) which undermines the breezy tone in which Hart operates best. Thus Ride Along sabotages itself although I suppose that doesnt really matter -- there are already plans in the works for Ride Along 2. But trust me you want to proceed with caution.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A wannabe cop hopes to impress a surly Atlanta police detective by shadowing him for a day. Rated PG-13 (language action sexual themes) BOTTOM LINE Hart yaks Cube snarls and together they mostly shoot blanks in this unfunny action-comedy. CAST Kevin Hart Ice Cube Tika Sumpter LENGTH 140 ""Today was a good day"" says Ice Cube as Atlanta Police Detective James in ""Ride Along."" Hip-hop fans will get the irony The line comes from a 1993 song by the pioneering gangster rapper here playing -- gasp -- a lawman. Granted Ice Cube already played a police captain in ""21 Jump Street"" but he delivers the line with such a broad smile that its hard not to laugh. That however is easily the funniest moment in ""Ride Along"" which pairs Ice Cube with the fast-talking comedian Kevin Hart as a wannabe cop named Ben. The story begins when Ben decides to prove himself worthy of marrying James sister Angela (Tika Sumpter) by riding along with him on a routine day. Its predictable stuff -- surely youve guessed that the two will break a major case -- but its also standard operating procedure for a buddy-cop comedy. As in ""48 Hrs."" ""Rush Hour"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" the real attraction here is always the chemistry between the two stars. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Harts springy energy and Ice Cubes deadpan snarl can be amusing but they cant compensate for weak material. Director Tim Story who cast Hart to good effect in 2012s ""Think Like a Man"" here throws him into several promising situations but the scenes fizzle and go nowhere. Ben never surprises us Hes small a video-game nerd and a blabbermouth who sure enough cant fight cant shoot a gun and irritates people. By the time Ben finally does show us some magic (a redo of Eddie Murphys barroom bluff in ""48 Hrs."") weve been let down too many times to care. Ice Cube a strong presence in rowdy comedies like ""Barbershop"" and ""Friday"" seems ill-suited to this tame toothless movie. Hes mostly limited to steely-eyed reaction shots and some banal cop talk with his partners. ""Ride Along"" relies increasingly on its criminal underworld plot which is to put it mildly pathetic.

Though he admits to never having read the actual script Snyder notes the predictable promising beauty of the films logline -- a scaredy-cat teacher has to spend a day riding alongside his girlfriends overprotective and aggressive cop brother. Apparently it was so good that its taken nearly a decade of rewrites and re-tinkerings to finally get Ride Along to the screen; the finished film has four credited screenwriters and presumably many more uncredited ones And after all that what have we got? An Ice Cube and Kevin Hart comedy that will probably be in a Rite-Aid discount bin in about six months. Ze sausage it iz delicious no? There have been a few changes to that allegedly perfect concept along the way. The risk-averse teacher is now Ben Barber (Hart) a school security guard who wants to join the police force. Hes still in love with James Paytons (Cube) sister (the never-not-stunning Tika Sumpter) and he still wants to marry her. And loose-cannon cop James still thinks Ben is a wimp and a loser and wants to teach him a lesson -- and so he drags him along one day as they answer various bizarre police dispatch calls. But perhaps to accommodate Harts blustery motormouth skills Ben has now been refashioned from your typical milquetoast into someone a bit harder to pin down -- the kind of guy who will talk a good game and throw himself into a dangerous situation only to cower away once things get physical and his teeny-tiny body is in danger of actual harm. It makes for a messy relationship as the lines between the foolhardy cop and the foolhardy civilian are now a bit less clear. But it also makes the film a bit less predictable. You never quite know what Ben will do and you never quite know how James will get him out of it. Though it starts off more like a comedic variation on Training Day Ride Along also bears more than a passing resemblance to last summers odd couple cop comedy The Heat in which by-the-book Fed Sandra Bullock and unhinged Boston cop Melissa McCarthy bickered and took down bad guys while becoming best friends. Like The Heat Ride Along has as much action as it does humor though a time traveler from 1996 might have his mind blown to learn that the Sandra Bullock movie is far more profane and violent than its Ice Cube counterpart. In both films though one character serves as the comic engine Here Hart has the energy to take his rat-tat-tat rants into odd fun directions but he doesnt quite have the hypnotically surreal whipsawing quality that McCarthy brought to her performance. As for Ice Cube he does irritated well and he gets to do a lot of that here. About 90 percent of his performance appears to be reaction shots. It all mostly works but you cant help but wonder at times if it could have been a lot funnier if it had just a bit more edge. Aside from some goofily intimate sex talk between Hart and Sumpter Ride Along never seems to want to push any envelopes or to take any real chances. And given the familiarity of the whole thing you keep wishing for something to raise your pulse. Hart brings some of that but its never quite enough. The premise of that long-ago spec script was a typical fish-out-of-water/buddy-cop tale. But weve had so many of those over the years that its hard not to watch Ride Along and be reminded of many more entertaining and surprising films that you could be watching in its place.

"Ride Along | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ride-along ) Ride Along (United States 2014) January 17 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ride Along the new action/comedy starring Ice Cube and Kevin Hart defies the clichA(c) that you cant judge a book by its cover. Nothing unexpected lurks beneath a bland and predictable exterior. Those who have seen a 30-second TV commercial (or the longer theatrical trailer) have no need to endure the production in its entirety they have experienced all director Tim Story can offer. At its best Ride Along is tolerable. At its worst it borders on insulting. Those who attend movies for the plot will find little to applaud about Ride Along. The narrative is merely an excuse to pair up the stars and fill the background with explosions and bullets. The familiar story is about two mismatched ""buddies"" who find themselves on the trail of a mysterious crime kingpin named ""Omar"" (Laurence Fishburne). James Payton (Ice Cube) is a pugnacious rebellious cop who has been tracking Omar for years with little success. His lieutenant (Bruce McGill) is losing patience with his lack of results. Ben Barber (Hart) is James would-be brother-in-law. Bens intended bride Angela (Tika Sumpter) wants him to get her brothers ""blessing"" for their engagement. That involves proving something about his character to James. To accomplish that Ben agrees to ""ride along"" for a day in James cop car. Initially its a set up to deflate and humiliate Ben but that changes when the situation with Omar erupts. Director Story whose dubious resume includes two bad Fantastic Four movies understands how to take material that could have been R-rated and neuter it for PG-13 consumption. The level of violence in Ride Along would be sufficient to get most similar films the more restrictive rating but Story makes sure that during gunfights camera movement becomes so spastic that its impossible to process whats happening. As a result the violence seems less extreme than it would if the scenes were filmed coherently. Whats good for pacifying the MPAA however leads to a terrible viewing experience. To the extent that Ride Along offers anything entertaining it comes from the interplay between Ice Cube and Hart who are channeling their own urban cop versions of Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison. These two have effective chemistry with Ice Cubes unsmiling ways playing well off Harts over-the-top high energy approach. Nevertheless its apparent that the need to keep things PG-13 ""clean"" blunts Harts comedic edge. The presence of occasional laugh-inducing material cant dispel the sense that the movie could have been hilarious if the restraints had been removed. Ride Along appeals to audiences who dont want to think much while relaxing for about 100 minutes in a theater. It offers generic action a trite storyline a predictable ending uneven comedy and passable chemistry between the leads. Theres plenty of energy but not much substance. Calling this ""workmanlike"" would be overpraising Storys dubious achievement. Its baffling that the script required four credited screenwriters but thats often the case with January movies material is progressively dumbed-down through overwriting to the point where the end result is forgettable. If youre intrigued check out the trailer. If after seeing that youre still interested by all means pay the admission fee. At least youll know exactly what youre getting; Ride Along has nothing to hide.

"Review Ride Along coasts on Kevin Harts comedy - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Ride Along coasts on Kevin Harts comedy Ride Along Quantrell D. Colbert / Universal Pictures Kevin Hart left and Ice Cube in ""Ride Along."" Kevin Hart left and Ice Cube in ""Ride Along."" (Quantrell D. Colbert / Universal Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Ride Along"" the latest go at the action-comedy-buddy-cop genre has the stone-hard cool of Ice Cube and the manic energy of stand-up comic Kevin Hart.With a sharper script ""Ride"" might have reached the bar set in the 1980s by Eddie Murphy in ""48 Hrs."" and ""Beverly Hills Cop."" But the laughs here are lazy and any sense of logic is definitely on the lam. The films not-so-secret weapon is Hart. Even with bad material the guy is really funny. Yet the movie relies too heavily on Harts ability to riff endlessly and breathlessly on his stature or lack of it (the comic is 5-foot-2 and he works it) his bravado or lack of it and of course his sex appeal or lack of it.Cube is solid as the impenetrable brick wall that Harts comic barrage bounces off. Their odd-couple shtick delivers laughs. But more often than not ""Ride Along"" chokes on its own fumes. GRAPHIC Faces to watch 2014 | EntertainmentThe two men are initially framed by what divides them. On one side is tough Atlanta detective James Payton (Cube) in the midst of a high-stakes arrest. Cut to Ben Barber (Hart) a high-school security guard completely engrossed in upping his score during a video game shootout.The conflict turns on Paytons plan to stomp out Barbers dreams of marrying the detectives sister Angela (Tika Sumpter) and joining the Atlanta police force. Which is not a bad starting point.What Barber doesnt know is that Payton has devised a ""rookie ride along"" designed to frighten him out of his wits and make it clear hes out of his league. But as fate would have it a chance for Payton to catch an elusive and infamously unseen drug lord intervenes. Let the friction and the fun begin. ... If only.On the set movies and TVTim Story who directed Hart in his 2012 breakout ""Think Like a Man"" pretty much puts everything on the comics back and forgot that a movie needs a story. ""Ride Along"" -- written by Greg Coolidge Jason Mantzoukas Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi -- doesnt have much of one. The plot twists are more like narrative accidents. Even a comedy about cops cant get away with being completely implausible though this one certainly tries.As Payton Cube is required to scowl a lot which he does very well. Harder is giving some punch to the phrase ""This is where it gets real"" or some variation of it about 100 times.""Ride Along"" is the kind of action comedy or drama in which the popular rapper-turned-actor is often cast. But in movies like ""21 Jump Street"" ""Rampart"" and the lighter down-home humor of ""Barbershop"" whether hes a good guy or bad funny or not Cube has proved he can do more than what hes given here.There is a lot of action and a lot of talk much of it painfully delivered by ""Ride Alongs"" strong and mostly squandered cast including John Leguizamo Bruce McGill Laurence Fishburne Bryan Callen and Jay Pharoah.There is an endearing sweetness to Barbers romancing of Angela making it believable that the leggy beauty would fall for him. Sumpter doesnt get much screen time which is unfortunate because shes a promising young talent and she uses her time well.But ""Ride Along"" is very much Harts game. When he gets revved up the comedy is delivered rapid fire. His signature style which first made him a stand-out on the comedy circuit is kind of like an assault rifle with its trigger locked on auto.Barbers bumbling attempts to try his hand at interrogating a suspect or at firing a gun -- or both at the same time -- are little gems. His hapless machismo keeps getting him and Payton into increasingly dangerous fixes. Occasionally Barber inadvertently does something right. Its a toss up which irritates Payton more.Within some of the chaos there are glimmers of what might have been. And Hart certainly tries to save the day. But like nearly everything else in ""Ride Along"" he falls a little short. At least the guns are blazing ... .Ride AlongMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of violence sexual content and brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying In general releasebetsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews Kevin Hart Think Like a Man (movie) Eddie Murphy Barbershop (movie) Review Heated action in the close confines of Freezer Review Hamlet as postwar soap opera Review Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? is affirming if demure Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-ride-along-movie-review-20140117,0,7900790.story#axzz2qc6vIxbj",200,ridealong14,ridealong,latimes
"Ride Along a fast trip to tedium Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRide Along a fast trip to tedium Review Standup comic Kevin Hart and rapper/actor Ice Cube team up in this loud pointless buddy comedy. Kevin Hart plays annoying wannabe cop Ben to Ice Cubes understandably irritated cop James in Ride Along.  (Univeral Pictures)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Jan. 16 2014Ride AlongStarring Kevin Hart Ice Cube. Directed by Tim Story. 100 minutes. Opens at major theatres Jan. 17. 14A.Its a noisy ride to nowhere.Ride Along pairing standup comic Kevin Hart with hip hop artist/actor Ice Cube is another in a long line of buddy comedies that aim to milk laughs from two mismatched characters. Too bad this one turns out to be a bum trip.Article Continued BelowCube plays James a cop and overprotective older brother who hopes to dissuade younger sister Angela from marrying her boyfriend Ben by demonstrating his lack of manliness. Since Ben has applied for entrance to the police academy James decides to take him on a ""ride along"" to test his mettle knowing that the ardent gamer is likely to falter in the face of real-life action.Unfortunately the storyline is a testament to tedium and cliche throughout. Having four writers listed in the screenwriter credits delivers the usual recipe of too many chefs delivering bland box office fare.The script uses words like ""ass-face"" and takes several shots at the diminutive Hart -- to wit ""youre about a chromosome away from being a midget"" -- laying bare a sense of desperation bordering on pathetic.Hart has built a solid career in comedy but his manic stage antics -- reminiscent of Rush Hours Chris Tucker though not quite as loud and annoying -- dont translate particularly well here. His motor mouth buffoonery wears thin awfully quickly.One nice surprise is Ice Cube who brings his trademark scowl but manages to emote just enough to make his character sympathetic. We certainly feel his pain in having to spend so much screen time with such an annoying future brother-in-law. Under the category of wasted effort theres John Leguizamo one of Cubes two cop buddies. (Why two? Who knows or cares?) Leguizamo is a gifted standup comedian in his own right and a versatile actor but the script gives him virtually nothing to demonstrate his array of talent.One also feels pity for fine veteran character actor Laurence Fishburne slumming it in the thankless role of Omar a criminal kingpin Detective Payton has been trying to nail for ages. Director Tim Story delivers car chases and pyrotechnics -- including an exploding barbecue in the final credits -- designed to inject action into a story with a serious comedy deficit. It all just feels so contrived flat and derivative.With so much wasted talent and so little comic payoff dont let this film take you for a ride.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Credit Universal Pictures Opens on Friday.Directed by Tim Story1 hour 40 minutesIce Cube and Kevin Hart create a crowd-pleasing if predictable variation of the buddy cop movie in ""Ride Along."" The plot isnt much but Mr. Harts fans at least are well served by the way his manic energy bounces off Ice Cubes growly stoicism.Mr. Hartis Ben who desperately wants to be a police officer though his only heroics have taken place while jacked into a multiplayer online video game. His girlfriend (Tika Sumpter) has an overprotective brother James (Ice Cube) a police officer known for his gonzo style.James doesnt like Ben and arranges to take him on a ride-along hoping this will somehow discourage both Bens interest in police work and his sisters interest in Ben. The plan is for Ben to experience a bunch of humiliating junk calls but instead the two end up in the midst of a major bust.The plot twists are easily guessed and the film goes on for one predicament too long but there are some good laughs. Mr. Hart is in self-deprecating mode a more palatable persona than the brash one in his recent stand-up concert film ""Let Me Explain"" and it suits the slim material nicely.""Ride Along"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) because police work involves a lot of cussing.

He was the lone high point of last months train wreck Grudge Match and he gives Ride just enough buoyancy to keep it afloat despite a story that would sink most performances.Hart plays Ben Barber an Atlanta security guard with plans to join the police academy. Ben is a realistic Paul Blart a rent-a-cop who fancies himself a Dirty Harry thanks to the video games that are his true passion.TRAILER Ride AlongREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYCOMING SOON The latest trailersBut before Ben proposes to his girlfriend Angela (Tika Sumpter) he wants the blessings of Angelas brother James (Ice Cube) himself an Atlanta cop. James offers to take Ben along on a police ride to test the suitors mettle.Hart and Cube deserve a better story than the one director Tim Story foists on the stars. James is your standard 1980s rogue cop complete with a lieutenant (Bruce McGill) who thinks his best man is out of control. And its literally minutes before Ben is unofficially deputized and helping work a Serbian guns racket.The lazy writing is enough to keep Ride Along from flying. But like Melissa McCarthy (who was also terrific in a cop comedy last years The Heat) Hart is willing to use his physical stature to great comedic effect and the screen crackles when hes on it.Harts at his best when hes self-deprecating and he goes there often in Ride Along. His panicked reaction when he thinks he sees a burglar -- pushing his fiancee out of the way as he shrieks in terror and runs into a wall -- is tear-inducing. He threatens taunting kids with prison time and is defended by his fiancee as being only ""weenie-ish.""Ride Along makes no bones about its love of Training Day a film thats quoted often. But the movie takes true inspiration from 1982s 48 Hrs. Eddie Murphys famous film debut.Hart is much like Murphy fast-talking mischievous and irresistible. Hes so confident and good-natured that we see how Angela fell for her pint-sized slacker.Ice Cube is fine as the straight man though Ride Along nearly breaks down when Hart is off-screen. And theres no telling what the actor could do with real material.But Hart does yeomans work in Ride Along and hes due for a promotion. 60 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1dVeDIT",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/01/16/ride-along-review/4504437/,200,ridealong17,ridealong,usatoday

No what ""Ride Along"" actually is mostly for the better is a forum for Kevin Hart to be the best stand-up comedian he can be. And when he is that Kevin Hart working at a mile a minute always on the verge of exasperation constantly examining new ways to deliver a joke ""Ride Along"" is an extremely watchable quasi-movie. When its bogged down by little peccadillos such as story relationships or logic well its clearly not half as good. The great fallacy of the Kevin Hart experience seems to be that there needs to be a ""real"" movie packaged around him as if both the fajita tortilla and fillings should be the same thickness. Not so The joy of Harts comedy is the constancy and the less plot you put around him the better of youll be throwback spoofs like ""Airplane"" and ""Spaceballs"" coming to mind as proper vehicles for the level of silliness a Hart project should aim for. To that end ""Ride Along"" is a strong recommend when Hart is talking but merely a mediocre attempt at a movie when hes not. Ben Barber (Kevin Hart) is smitten with Angela Payton (Tika Sumpter). He wants to marry her but theres only one problem and that problem is her brother Detective James Payton (Ice Cube). Though most brothers are protective James takes it to a whole new level clearly of the opinion that Ben is worthless and not at all deserving of his little sister. However Ben has a plan to impress James (and his special lady) hell join the police academy and gain James respect on his own turf. Everything is going swimmingly as Ben gains acceptance into the police academy (which come to think of it would be another great Kevin Hart film) and this after working as a high school security guard. When James hears the news he comes up with a plan on the spot to take Ben out on a police ride along ostensibly to humiliate / dissuade him from pursuing Angela any further. Thus the concept is born and ""Ride Along"" is in effect. From here on out were be treated to a series of comedy sketches - watch Kevin Hart get chesty with huge bikers watch Kevin Hart try to arrest a naked man and most of these moments do elicit laughter. In between these moments there are trouble spots though because the ""filler"" is the same old conceit every time out with Ice Cube looking at Hart angry and Hart trying to impress him but to no avail. The reasons these moments fall so flat is that its immediately clear Ice Cube wont be allowed to like Kevins character until the ""critical"" juncture making the rest of ""Ride Along"" into a bit of a slog just to get to that scene. Still its clear Hart is a comedian in ascension and Ice Cube was at least well chosen as the person to grimace at him. Cube for his part emotes a macho solidness thats hard to come by hes all at once the guy who would insult shoot or knock you out. Thats range Logically ""Ride Along"" is your standard paint-by-numbers cop buddy comedy. The guys will learn to work together sure okay and the very thing that seems like Bens weakness will be the one thing that bails them out in the end (stop me if youve ever seen a movie before). Tika Sumpters character Angela is given precious little to do besides sport the tightest of shorts but when Cube Hart and Sumpter are on the screen together theres at least some respite from the incessant ""Ill glare you prattle on"" dichotomy that most of the rest of the movie sticks to. Recent films such as ""21 Jump Street"" (in which Ice Cube also played the guy who glared a lot) have done well to have both main characters carry the comedy; by choosing not to place each protagonist into either the ""manic"" or ""depressive"" box the entire film was smoothed out with the result being the jokes could come from many different angles. But at its very best ""Ride Along"" evokes glimmers of ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Beverly Hills Cop"". Those films were more serious in tone but both gave ample opportunities for the straight man / crazy man comedic set-up that theyre shooting so hard for here. Still it seems apparent that ""Ride Along"" would have been better off either embracing the more serious tone (and taking an R rating) or just playing it much less serious overall (""Police Academy""). By middling it going right through the goal posts of its genre ""Ride Along"" ends up being a little more mushy and typical than it should have been given the great advantage with which the film began. SCORE 6.3 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and has been on a police ride along. It was awesome.

Tom Clancys Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) as a young covert CIA analyst uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack. (Photo/Video Paramount) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Jan. 16 2014 305 p.m. ET Instead of a wolf on Wall Street ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" gives us a fox--the Tom Clancy hero played this time by Chris Pine. A covert CIA agent Jack leads a double life as an executive in a brokerage house using his business and finance creds to sniff out iffy transactions that may reveal terrorist plots. The story loosely based on the Clancy canon doesnt make a lot of sense unless youre deeply into ""external sterilized interventions"" or ""dark pool outrhythms."" On the other hand its easy enough to compute a succession of car chases and several outbreaks of hand-to-hand combat. This is moviemaking in a modular mode an inspiration-free action adventure--with cheesy cinematography--that fills its modest running time by fitting together familiar elements into something reliably even insistently not new. WSJ film critic Joe Morgenstern tells us why he calls the film ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" ""uninspired"" and its cinematography ""Cheesy."" Photo Paramount. Jack himself has become a module a plug-and-play character previously embodied by Alec Baldwin Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck. In a spirit of industry-wide interchangeability Hollywoods new Captain Kirk has newly been plugged into the Ryan role. Mr. Pine is extremely likable in everything he does and thats certainly true here though hes unlikely to topple Daniel Craig or Matt Damon from their places in the tough-guy pantheon. In fact Jacks generally mild demeanor gets a wry acknowledgement at the very end just before he and his CIA mentor Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) meet the President of the United States. ""Any way"" Harper asks ""you can get that Boy-Scout-on-a-field-trip look off your face?"" No one will mistake the villain of the piece Viktor Cherevin for a Boy Scout. A Russian oligarch hes played by Kenneth Branagh who also directed with a comic-opera accent thats zestful for a while but then like the movie itself increasingly silly. Viktors villainy doesnt lack for ambition. Hes up to an assortment of dirty tricks that only Jack can detect and thwart including currency manipulation meant to plunge the United States into what Viktor foresees gleefully as ""the second Great Depression."" (One could argue that we almost pulled that off on our own.) The script is credited to Adam Cozad who has no prior script credits and David Koepp a veteran screen writer and rewriter. Its terribly clumsy and except for the frenzied action intractably abstract what with financial maneuverings on a global scale and digital Niagaras pouring down flat screens. (The silliest sequence of all takes place aboard a CIA plane where scores of analysts with data-sucking computers give Jack instant intel on an impending calamity.) Keira Knightley is Cathy Jacks fiancee. She has little to do apart from being confused about his true occupation and being in danger as a result of it. Recognizing this lapse the movie tries to rectify it albeit late in the game by allowing Cathy rather than Jack to identify a crucial photo as the office building he works in. Journey to the South Pacific Watch a clip from the IMAX film ""Journey to the South Pacific"" an underwater voyage to Indonesia to learn about its inhabitants as well as efforts being made in the region for ocean conservation. Narrated by Cate Blanchett. (Photo/Video IMAX) As the atmosphere warms and the oceans rise documentary filmmakers with an educational focus are facing the challenge of informing their audiences without discouraging them. ""Journey To the South Pacific"" an IMAX 3D production aimed at young people grafts a fictional story line onto spectacular documentary footage. The narrative details the accelerating loss of species diversity in recent decades the precipitous decline of big fish in fragile ocean ecologies and in particular the plight of the Pacific leatherback turtle an ancient creature facing imminent extinction. Mostly though the tone is upbeat. Its a story of kids learning how to make a difference in their own back yard which in this case is a group of islands within a marine park reserve in the remote Indonesian province of West Papua. ENLARGE A scene from Journey to the South Pacific IMAX Corporation/MacGillivray Freeman Films The film directed by Greg MacGillivray and narrated by Cate Blanchett explores its subject through the wide eyes of Jawi a 13-year-old who is charming without trying to be and who plays a mean ukulele. Jawi circumnavigates the reserve aboard the Kalabia a small vessel and floating classroom that in fact as well as in this fictional narrative spreads the conservation gospel among West Papuas children. He also dives--with no more gear than goggles and flippers--while the camera watches him and the otherworldly creatures that surround him. Im always delighted by the clarity and monumental proportions of IMAX films; this one lived up to my expectations. For openers its amazing that the water doesnt spill into the auditorium. Then theres the spectacle of the waters contents which need to be treasured and protected manta rays soaring and swooping like Matisse dancers; undulating battalions of rainbow-colored fish; tiny sea horses camouflaged perfectly although magnified by the IMAX lens into animals of impressive stature; flounder-like flatfish that resist the 3D process; a gathering of 40-foot whale sharks more comfortable with Jawis company than he is with theirs; and 500-pound leatherbacks mysteriously returned from the Oregon coast to the same stretch of beach where they were spawned. At times ""Journey To the South Pacific"" verges uncomfortably on merry-villager tropes--whole villages of kids running joyously to meet the boat while the music swells. But this is a film with a positive message thats delivered eloquently and whos to say that joyous purpose doesnt have its place? Ride Along Watch a clip from the film ""Ride Along."" Fast-talking security guard Ben (Kevin Hart) joins his cop brother-in-law James (Ice Cube) on a 24-hour patrol of Atlanta in order to prove himself worthy of marrying James sister. (Photo/Video Universal) By now moviegoers have learned to expect little from Hollywood in January; tis the season to be shoddy. Still ""Ride Along"" set in Atlanta gives shoddiness a bad name. Kevin Hart is Ben a rent-a-cop and childish nebbish in love with Tika Sumpters beautiful Angela. What she sees in him is unclear though he does have a good heart an amusing motor mouth and a gift for touching craziness. (What he sees in her is another matter since the wretched script hasnt even given Angela an occupation let alone a core personality.) To marry the couple needs the approval of her brother James a cop played by Ice Cube. James the very soul of disapproval insists that Ben prove himself by riding along with him on a 24-hour patrol. ENLARGE Kevin Hart left and Ice Cube in Ride Along Universal Pictures Theres comic potential in what becomes an extended hazing ritual (and what amounts as the script notes in passing to a riff on the excellent ""Training Day""). But Mr. Hart whose comedy regularly refers to his short stature has a role that comes up shorter than he does so he wears out his welcome with amiable banter that becomes incessant babble. And Ice Cube gives a charmless performance that substitutes declamatory anger for acting. The director was Tim Story who did the memorably exuberant ""Barber Shop"" a decade ago and the cast includes Laurence Fishburne. Whats he doing in a movie like this? Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Unstoppable (2010) Chris Pine is the rookie conductor and Denzel Washington is the veteran engineer in this terrific thriller directed by the late Tony Scott. The premise is simple to the point of primal -- a runaway freight train hurtling through Pennsylvania with a load of lethal chemicals and no one in the locomotive. On the same track heading toward it is another freight train pulled by a locomotive with the movies co-stars at the controls. The cast includes Rosario Dawson Kevin Corrigan and Ethan Suplee. Mark Bomback wrote the script. Ben Seresin did the sensational cinematography. ENLARGE Tropical Rainforest (1992) Ben Shedds superb documentary made for IMAX is available as Netflix streaming video. Thats a comedown but not a wipeout; the content remains intact. ""Imagine were travelers in time"" begins the films narrator the genially orotund Geoffrey Holder ""Its 400 million years ago."" The film shows us the growth of the rain forests matchless biological diversity and culminates in unprecedented destruction by contemporary loggers. ""Were just part of evolution"" the narrator says evenly ""no better than insects and no worse."" But we have foresight the film notes. ""The future is a time that we can change."" ENLARGE Three Kings (1999) Yes Ive recommended David O. Russells moral fable of the Gulf War many times but this time its for the extraordinarily nuanced performance by Ice Cube as Chief Elgin a committed Christian who confronted by a map that holds a promise of legendary wealth believes ""the good Lord has put this map in our path."" Most prominent in the cast are George Clooney Mark Wahlberg and Spike Jonze. In my initial review I said the film ""vaults David Russell to the first rank of contemporary filmmakers."" Thats where he remains to this day.

(AP) By Stephanie Merry January 16 2014 Follow stephmerry It feels good to laugh. After bingeing on a heavy meal of year-end movie releases -- those films competing for a gold trophy come March -- its easy to forget how pleasant a moderately inane broad comedy can be. The Oscar antidote goes by the name of ""Ride Along"" a buddy-cop comedy that isnt at all original but does have one big thing going for it. Or more accurately a little thing comedian Kevin Hart. He plays Ben a motor-mouthed gamer and high school security guard who wants to marry his girlfriend Angela (Tika Sumpter) but needs to get approval from her prickly brother James (Ice Cube). The two men got off on the wrong foot but James a police officer tells Ben theres one way he can prove himself James proposes that Ben tag along during a day on the job. Given that Ben is an aspiring cop he jumps at the chance. Predictably the day doesnt unfold as heroically as Ben hopes. He cant intimidate a small child much less a loitering biker gang and when he tries to handcuff an irate nearly naked man covered in honey well you can just imagine. Of course the big case James has been working which involves Serbians and an elusive criminal mastermind named Omar comes to a head on the one day James is babysitting his potential brother-in-law. The outcome is obvious but Hart distracts from the familiar territory with consistent laughs. As a stand-up comedian hes known for his spot-on delivery but the diminutive jokester also proves himself a master of physical comedy whether hes gliding awkwardly across the roof of a car imitating Rihannas dance moves or reacting to a false-alarm home invasion by falling into a bookcase and knocking himself out cold. Hart is clearly working overtime; theres nothing effortless about his histrionic delivery but it works. Ice Cube does less heavy lifting as the straight man (though who knows what kind of existential crisis he may be grappling with given the unprintable things he used to rap about police back in the day) but he conveys the checklist of important traits for the seasoned curmudgeon exasperation arrogance and buried deep a soft spot. Speaking of hitting the high points the action in ""Ride Along"" looks slick with a car chase that opens the movie and an impressive show of explosives. None of it will be enough to make ""Ride Along"" memorable. You might think of the movie as a long car trip youve taken many times before. The same old roadside attractions may not be exciting but when youve got great company who cares? PG-13. At area theaters.

Colbert) Ride Along is out of gas By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Jan 16 2014 (...) Quantrell D. Colbert This image released by Universal Pictures shows Ice Cube right and Kevin Hart in a scene from ""Ride Along."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Quantrell D. Colbert) When youve got a friend who is always bumming rides never pays for gas and often steers you in dicey directions is he worth the aggravation because occasionally he makes you laugh? Thats the calculation behind the cop comedy ""Ride Along."" Kevin Hart hits the vicinity of humor with a few of his drive-by wisecracks but the movie itself has nothing under the hood.Hart plays Ben a security guard at an Atlanta high school who dreams of becoming a police officer and continually practices his aim in violent video games. His tall and tolerant girlfriend Angela (Tika Sumpter) is the sister of cop James (Ice Cube) who thinks that the motor-mouthed runt isnt worthy of her. But when Ben is accepted into the police academy James gives him one chance to prove his professional and personal worth by riding shotgun in the police cruiser.Instead of breaking new ground the several screenwriters exhumed a few buddy comedies and hoped we wouldnt notice how bony the plot is. After some Serbian thugs shoot up a shopping mall -- with the Atlanta cops recklessly returning fire and then commandeering civilian cars for the requisite fiery chase -- James goes gunning for their Mister Big a shadowy character called Omar. While over-eager Ben contributes some of the knowledge he gleaned from gaming two other cops (John Leguizamo and Bryan Callen) prank him with false alarms.If theres a surprise in this movie its that Hart is marginally more restrained than his obvious influence Chris Tucker in the ""Rush Hour"" movies. Theres even a glimmer of goodness in the character that melts Ice Cubes cold demeanor just in time for the stupid shoot-em-up finale. ""Ride Along"" is rated PG-13 which negates the potential pleasure of a fully loaded laffer. Its like everyone involved is on parole afraid to disturb the piecemeal pantomime of an action comedy. Its getting harder to remember that producer Cube was the rapper and real-life desperado who blindsided us in ""Boyz n the Hood."" Maybe in the inevitable ""Ride Along 2"" the partners can go gunning for the evil overlord who stole his street cred.What ""Ride Along""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 145  Content Violence and strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Grade F This grossly incompetent cop comedy proves that even a comedian as spirited as Kevin Hart cant improvise in a vacuum. Hes stuck in the role of a motor-mouthed security guard who goes on a ride-along with a tough cop (Ice Cube) to prove that hes fit to marry the mans sister and enroll in Atlantas police academy. Its a particularly heartless mindless and soulless example of the buddy movie - really more just a frenemy burlesque of a buddy movie. Hart has nothing to play except yammering enthusiasm and improbable bravado. And Ice Cube appears to think hes Dirty Harry reincarnate - his loner cop follows a lawman version of ""by any means necessary"" sporting mean smiles or scowls that might as well be tattooed on his face. The civilian uses knowledge of weaponry hes developed as a gamer along with his tiptop memory to help crack a case involving a mysterious Mr. Big. But for the longest time the gnarly policeman subjects his gung-ho acolyte to extravagant mirthless humiliations. In this films terms the citizen must prove himself by spraying bullets lobbing grenades and executing an improbable physical takedown of a loathsome villain. ""Ride Along"" contains credits for a backfield of screenwriters but it has so little consistency or follow-through it might have been written in a single huddle. In one scene our embattled hero cant handle the kickback of a gun or hit the rim of a target. Mere hours later he casually pumps lead into a bad guys shoe. The director Tim Story displays none of the flair for capturing distinctive personalities and performing rhythms that he showed in ""Barbershop"" and ""The Fantastic Four."" From the horrendous shoot-em-up opening to the routine gag stuck in the closing credits ""Ride Along"" keeps shooting itself in the foot.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Ride Along Kevin Hart Small Cop The stand-up standout takes a detour to movie stardom with the sub-ordinary cop comedy By Richard Corliss Jan. 15 2014 Share Read Later Quantrell D. Colbert / Universal Pictures / APFrom left Ice Cube and Kevin Hart in ""Ride Along."" Ride Along Year 2014 Director Tim Story Studio Universal Actors Ice Cube Kevin Hart John Leguizamo Laurence Fishburne Tika Sumpter Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture In a time when films are either gigantic nine-figure epics or indie pictures on a paupers budget a middling movie has its theoretical charms. Viewers neednt prepare to be awed or do their Sundance homework. A movie of meager ambitions sets the comforting bar of low expectations. We go simply to be diverted mildly entertained. For decades that was Hollywoods promise to audiences fulfilled in the B movie but now nearly extinct. Today so few films have those modest old ambitions that Ordinary is the new Extraordinary. Ride Along could be a new example of that endangered species. It doesnt make you wait till the end for the actor and director credits; rather the movie spills them over the opening scene of a heist -- just like the mediocre old days. Its also a buddy-cop movie virtually the Pringles of film genres. And its stars are Ice Cube the rapper whose film career stretches from Boyz N the Hood in 1991 to another buddy-cop movie 21 Jump Street two years ago and Kevin Hart whose stand-up stardom has led him to more prominent movie roles. (READ Joel Steins profile of Kevin Hart) In the script credited or debited to Greg Coolidge Jason Mantzoukas Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi the two cops arent bantering pals but bitter adversaries the veteran James Payton (Cube) tough honest and weary and Ben Barber (Hart) a high school security guard who dreams of joining the Atlanta PD. He is also mouthy accident-prone and crime of the century engaged to marry James foxy sister Angela (Tika Sumpter). So James takes him on a one-day ride-along in his squad car exacting the promise that if Ben doesnt cut it on his ""training day"" hell get out of Angelas life. Expect screwups peril from a drug gang and the eventual bonding of opposites with complementary skills. Or in the tradition of the middling movie expect next to nothing. Directed by Tim Story whose career has embraced both the soft black-angled comedy genre (Barbershop Think Like a Man) and the Marvel epic (Fantastic Four and its 2007 sequel) Ride Along has one distinctive calling card Hart. A 5-ft. 2-in. bundle of friendly aggression and cries of plaintive bafflement that he makes sound like hallelujahs Hart has scored in two stand-up movies the 2011 Feel My Pain and last years Let Me Explain which earned 33 million (on a 2.5 million budget) and is the top comedy concert film since Eddie Murphy Raw in 1987. Harts funny-charming turn in Think Like a Man stoked the fantasy that he could be the next Murphy or Richard Pryor a stand-up comic who became a platinum movie star. Eddie hasnt been that for a decade or more and Pryor died in 2005. (READ Corlisss review of Think Like a Man) Harts Ben earns his salary scaring kids into staying in school by telling one potential truant that he could end up a disfigured war veteran who wont be able to walk to the unemployment line because ""You got no feet"" But his vocation to the preposterous exclusion of gorgeous Angela is playing a video game called Blackhammer. A maestro of virtual violence Ben cant control or calm Atlanta street life. When James tells him to get a motorcycle gang out of a no-parking zone one of the dudes -- no its a woman biker with a goatee -- spits on his shoe. Enraged but unfazed Ben tells the woman to ""go get Purell and some Baby Wipes"" before James saves him from certain gelding. Well of course Bens bantam bravado will help James as he faces down the drug lord Omar (Laurence Fishburne in a late visit); and Ice Cubes angry tilde eyebrows will relax into grudging gratitude. But too many of the scenes play like discarded bits from In Living Color. John Leguizamo who a decade ago might have been what Hart hopes to be is wasted in a supporting role. And crucial mistake Hart plays more strident than sweet this time and risks forfeiting his audience appeal. The one minor hope -- that this Kevin Hart Small Cop might lead him toward the box-office empyrean that Kevin James enjoyed after his Paul Blart Mall Cop hit it big when released five years ago this weekend -- now looks almost hopeless. Too bad that Ride Along never makes it to Ordinary; it sinks into sub-. This is a movie you keep watching only from lethargy.

"Ride Along movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Ride Along  Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Early bloggy reviews of ""Ride Along"" have rolled in this week with phrases such as ""perfectly acceptable"" and ""been-there-done-that"" suggesting the likely range of opinion. Itll probably be a hit Audiences are getting precisely what theyre promised.This is the ol odd-couple cops routine rigged up to support the pairing of Ice Cube in the role of a snarling Atlanta police detective on the trail of a mysterious arms dealer and Kevin Hart as the detectives prospective brother-in-law a high school security guard with aspirations to join the force. Harts best bits in ""Ride Along"" such as they are and such as it is hark back to the panicking-ninny routines of many other comedians from Eddie Cantor to ""Rush Hours"" Chris Tucker.The 2001 drama ""Training Day"" is name-checked in ""Ride Along"" and some of the stuff in this diversion isnt much less vile than anything Denzel Washington got up to in ""Training Day."" The story has a bizarre undertone. Cubes character is so creepily protective of his sister played by Tika Sumpter in various states of decorative undress he comes off like someone who should be tailed not someone doing the tailing.Harts Ben Barber must prove his worthiness to his future in-law and show he has what it takes to be this movies idea of a good cop measured in how many innocent bystanders come in for friendly fire. The rest of the movie is sexual molestation jokes misjudged brutality and a general glorification of assault weapons. (The films rated PG-13 and itd be pretty stupid to take anyone under 12.)The supporting cast features John Leguizamo and Bryan Callen as Cubes colleagues and Bruce McGill as the tetchy lieutenant.Director Tim Story cant do much with the screenplay which smells of the eternally rewritten paste-up job. After Storys loose ingratiating work on ""Barbershop"" and ""Think Like a Man"" I hoped for something more fun here. ""Ride Along"" trading in too much action and not enough comedy is best considered as the latest restaurant to open in an Olive Garden-type chain. No surprises. Pretty much like the last one you went to. Plus lots of breadsticks. mjphillipstribune.com""Ride Along"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of violence sexual content and brief strong language)Running time 140Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies PG-13 Rated Movies Tim Story Barbershop (movie) Bruce McGill Kevin Hart REVIEW Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit  REVIEW Big Bad Wolves  1/2 REVIEW The Nut Job  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-ride-along-0117-20140116,0,6231588.column",200,ridealong26,ridealong,chicagotribune

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday January 16 2014 1200 PM Title Ride Along Film Info PG-13 Violence language sexuality. Area theaters. In the first five minutes of ""Ride Along"" director Tim Story gives us a shootout a car chase and a massive explosion. So if youre looking for brainless action hop in. But if youre aiming any higher youll probably want to find another ride. The director seems to assume -- probably accurately -- that stars Ice Cube and Kevin Hart already have enough fans to pack theaters. He lets his leads do what they do and doesnt bother asking for more. Cube (who was also in Storys much funnier ""Barbershop"") scowls and growls as James a longtime detective in the Atlanta Police Department. And as his soon-to-be brother-in-law Ben Hart is manic and frantic. Ice Cube and John Leguizamo in Ride Along Since Bens fiancee Angela (Tika Sumpter) wants her brothers blessing before she gets married the two guys agree to spend a day together. Ben wants to be a cop and is desperate to prove himself so hes thrilled when James suggests they pair up for a patrol. James however thinks Ben is unworthy of Angela -- and intends to prove it. For a while he and his partners (John Leguizamo Bryan Callen) have some fun scaring Ben with fake emergencies. But things turn serious when word comes through that a major arms deal is about to go down. Ride Along is a blast for Ice Cube and Kevin Hart. Story and his four screenwriters dont exactly strain themselves to find a new angle in this mismatched buddy comedy. Picture ""Rush Hour"" and then imagine Hart as the annoying kid in ""Are We There Yet?"" Youve basically just watched the entire movie in your head. If you actually want to see some mayhem though theres just enough here to make the effort worth your while. Story keeps the pace up with some satisfying action scenes. The stars do work hard to mine laughs. Ultimately though the tired plot exists solely to pair Ice Cubes slow-burn silence with Harts antic chatter. Each has a few amusing moments. But without any fresh material both wind up spinning their wheels. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Ride Along Kevin Hart cowers jumps fidgets raises his voice into a high nasal whine manically repeats words and phrases for comic effect and blurts out big chunks of dialogue in single breaths. In other words he behaves like Jerry Lewis and the movie--an action comedy about a high school security guard who spends a day with his girlfriends cop brother--improbably brings to mind the buddy comedies Lewis made with Dean Martin in the 1950s. The rapport between Hart and co-star Ice Cube has all the hallmarks of contemporary mainstream comedy (pop culture references trash-talk riffs) but the movies Hart-centric set pieces--most of which revolve around him impersonating authority figures--hearken back to Lewis. Many Jerry Lewis staples including bratty children and imposing tough guys are present and accounted for; at one point Hart even childishly leaps into Ice Cubes arms Lewis-style.Set mostly over the course of a single day Ride Along stars Hart as Ben a wannabe cop who spends most of his free time playing multiplayer shooters on his Xbox. (This again recalls Lewis comics- and movie-obsessed characters.) After receiving an acceptance letter from the police academy Ben tells tough-as-nails Atlanta detective James (Cube oozing ""Im just playing along with this"" aloofness) about his plans to marry James sister once he graduates. James is an overprotective older-brother type who thinks than Ben isnt good enough for his sister and he suggests that Ben prepare for academy training by shadowing him for a day assuming that his aspiring brother-in-law will prove himself unworthy.Ben is dorky and unimposing but hes still a competent prospective law-enforcement officer so James sets out to deliberately sabotage him by asking the dispatcher to reroute him all of the most annoying calls. These minor disturbances end up tying into a crime ring James has been investigating for the past three years--a development which recalls another Martin amp; Lewis-flavored buddy-cop comedy 2010s The Other Guys. Ride Along even opens with an explosion-laden car chase that brings to mind The Other Guys beginning but it lacks the earlier films affection for police work/culture and its populist anger. Rather Ride Along is just another renegade-cop-knows-best movie with Ben and James back-and-forth hung on a generic gun-smuggling plotline populated with non-ironical stock types.Is any of it funny? Hart and Cubes deliveries certainly are but skilled comedians can make people laugh without being all that funny especially if theres a large audience involved. The true measure of a joke isnt the immediate laugh effect but whether it bears repeating. American comedies used to be some of the most carefully crafted movies around (two Martin amp; Lewis vehicles--Artists And Models and Hollywood Or Bust--are among the most formally assured Hollywood films of their era) but changing preferences have pushed them to emphasize delivery over comic style or whats actually being delivered. Theres nothing funny about Ride Alongs direction which is handled by Tim Story the indistinguishable journeyman who helmed Barbershop Think Like A Man and two largely forgotten Fantastic Four movies. The best thing that can be said about Storys style is that it never undermines a joke. Ride Along is at its best when it embraces the comedy of an earlier era when performance was just the surface of an inherently funny situation or scene a trip to a gun range that verges on slapstick with loose-limbed Ben struggling to hold a front-heavy handgun upright; a confrontation with gun smugglers in a strip club with Ben prancing around blissfully unaware of the danger hes in; a sequence that intercuts James interrogation of an informant (Jay Pharaoh) with Bens struggling to interrogate the informants kid brother. However as the movie enters its third act the generic plot kicks in with a string of non-comic scenes enlivened by one-liners--an unfortunate reminder that as often as Ride Along seems to be channeling 1954 its still a 2014 studio comedy.

"Ride Along 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Ride Along 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Jan 15 2014 516 PM You know that blurb they show during the closing credits of movies something along the lines of ""No animals were harmed during the making of this film?"" They should put up something similar while the credits roll for ""Ride Along."" Maybe something like ""No brains were used during the making of this film."" History is lousy with mismatched-partner cop movies and Tim Storys film is just another in that long line. Its better than some (though none spring immediately to mind) worse than others (start with ""Lethal Weapon"" and work your way down). Kevin Hart a genuinely funny guy plays Ben Barber. Hes a school security guard who wants to be an Atlanta police officer; his qualifications appear to consist mostly of being really good at violent video games. He is also in love with Angela (Tika Sumpter) whose brother James (Ice Cube) is a bad-attitude lone-wolf-type cop. He doesnt play by the rules blah blah blah. He has the requisite short-tempered lieutenant (Bruce McGill) who is fed up with James freelancing in his pursuit of a villain named Omar who no one has ever seen not even his own henchmen. Ben wants James approval before asking Angela to marry him. This seems unlikely as James detests Ben only in part because Ben once set him on fire during a backyard barbecue. James arranges for Ben to ride along with him on a shift ostensibly to let him prove that he is marriage material for Angela. Once James asks dispatch for all the crazy calls a series of predictably well crazy scenes ensue. Everything is predictable even the twists. Might Bens video-game skills come in handy in real life? Hmm. Wait dont think about that too long. Its OK; the screenwriters didnt either. There is notable irony in seeing Ice Cube play a police officer. As a member of N.W.A. Ice Cube one of the baddest of the gangsta rappers had a few colorful things to say about the police on the album ""Straight Outta Compton."" (Look it up. Listen to it.) Granted the album and the song in question came out more than 25 years ago. But now Ice Cube seems happy enough to make winking references to his rap career; the nod to ""It Was a Good Day"" here is actually pretty funny. So is Hart at least when given the opportunity. Ice Cube is a good actor in other films but Hart is what makes ""Ride Along"" better than it otherwise would have been. You can practically see Hart straining to break free of the script and let loose with a wild improvisational rant and you never lose hope that he might. (Spoiler alert He doesnt.) Hart faced a similar dilemma with the recent ""Grudge Match"" which was dismal. Thats too bad. Eventually a movie will come along that really showcases Harts talents. But ""Ride Along"" isnt it.

""I am the man"" Cube insists. You cant blame him for being defensive. Now a 44-year-old father of five Cube is three decades away from the furious teenager who co-founded N.W.A in his senior year of high school. Hes allowed to soften -- or really melt. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Not that he has. Cube is determined to prove hes still cold and hard. In Ride Along his default expression is snarl. Hes quick to blaze bullets in a crowded mall admits his Wi-Fi password is ""SuspectShot23"" and when carjacking a valet to chase a perp gets pissed that they offer him a Prius. (""Man get that bullshit out of here."")His Atlanta detective has two problems and a conscience about ignoring the rules of engagement aint one. First the force is sick of him pursuing an unknown mastermind named Omar and second his sister (Tika Sumpter) is engaged to marry a 5-foot-2 high school security guard (Kevin Hart) who Cube grumbles is ""about a chromosome away from being a midget."" Someone should tell him there are worse things that could happen to his sister than a dude trying to put a ring on it but judging by his daydreams of blasting Hart in the chest with his Glock Im calling Not It.Film Details Ride Along RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time100 min. More Info Trailer Hart plays a video game expert who wants to shoot real bullets by joining the police. (No theres no height requirement but yes Atlanta candidates have to be able to scale a six-foot wall.) Sure hes a small man casually hopping on a kitchen counter in his scenes with 5-foot-7 Sumpter to gain a few inches and resigning himself to disappearing completely from the screen when she presses him against the wall for a kiss. But the script assures us hes got a big package -- his game nickname is BlackHammer -- and an even bigger mouth. Which he needs. With Cube in dour dickhead mode the stand-up comic works double-time for laughs just as he had to do in Grudge Match. Hes forced to talk for two eventually getting so hyped up he delivers his lines at a scream. Harts a millimeter away from obnoxious but his desperation won me over. At least hes trying to entertain.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm When Hart convinces his brother-in-law-to-be to let him tag along for a day Ride Along shifts into cruise control as just another cop comedy. Sort of. The cliches are all here the big case the tight-ass lieutenant the partners who cant click. Its the same formula Hollywoods been using since the Keystone Kops swaggered down the street with batons. We laughed at them for being fools just as we did at the badge-wearing buffoons of Dragnet Police Academy The Other Guys and even Paul Blart Mall Cop. Even when the cops are capable say in Beverly Hills Cop or Lethal Weapon theyre game to make wisecracks about themselves. But in Ride Along the joke feels like its on us.Director Tim Story and his four-man screenwriting team think the height of hilarity is Ice Cube smacking around civilians. Like Observe and Report this ego-tripping law enforcer is cynicism disguised as comedy. The only difference is that Seth Rogen knew his character was an asshole meathead. Cube is convinced hes the hero. I bet kids whove been stopped and frisked will crack up when he threatens to falsely accuse a boy of assaulting a police officer. Maybe theyll double over during the scene where he shrugs off the shooting of an unarmed man. You know who wouldnt smile at that? Young Ice Cube.Forget going soft -- Ride Along proves Ice Cube has bigger image problems than kiddie movies and Coors Light commercials. Its not his Hollywood career that makes him a sellout. Its not even that the brave big-mouthed teen who co-wrote ""Fuck tha Police"" grew up to play a cop. Its that the rapper and activist who recorded 1992s The Predator a furious album about the Rodney King attack now is embracing exactly the kind of violent entitled civil rights-crushing cop he once demonized.Police brutality demands a riot? This Cube thinks its a laugh riot. Not that 24-year-old Cube was a saint. Im still smarting from his track ""Cave Bitch"" in which he says he cant stand ""no stringy-haired blonde hair blue-eyed pale-skinned ... bitch named Amy."" (Ouch) Still its disheartening to see him in this boneheaded comedy that reflects -- not dissects -- our casual at-least-it-wasnt-me attitude toward law enforcement abuse. And because he mean-mugs through the movie looking like the same old stern Cube who rocked a Raiders hat instead of a badge its harder to notice the glacial change thats happened under the surface especially when he doesnt seem to notice it himself.After smashing up a farmers market for a prank Detective Cube turns to the camera and grins ""Today was a good day."" Maybe for him. But I bet everyone else in Ride Along wishes his police car had rolled right past them.RIDE ALONG | Directed by Tim Story | Written by Greg Coolidge Jason Mantzoukas Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi | Universal Pictures | Citywide1 Ice Cube left and Kevin HartPHOTO BY QUANTRELL COLBERT Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

NAACP Awards Nominees Include Kerry Washington Andre Braugher and Kevin Hart This buddy-cop retread wastes two talented performers on substandard material Comedian-turned-actor Kevin Hart has expressed his desire to have a career like Eddie Murphys but anyone who has sat through recent Murphy big-screen vehicles like ""A Thousand Words"" ""Norbit"" ""Meet Dave"" or ""Imagine That"" might put Harts aspirations in the be-careful-what-you-wish-for column. And while the mismatched-buddy-cop formula of ""48 Hrs."" gave Murphys career an effective kickstart back in the 1980s Harts similarly themed ""Ride Along"" feels like the copy of the copy of the copy of Murphys influential hit. Instead of Murphys wiseacre convict we get Hart as Ben a motor-mouthed video game fanatic who spends the day with his prospective brother-in-law James (Ice Cube) a rule-breaking cop on the hunt for an elusive crime kingpin. (James like Nick Noltes character in ""48 Hrs."" is the kind of policeman whose short-tempered supervisor is constantly threatening to take him off the case.) See video Kevin Hart Hopes Ice Cube Is Not the Death of Him in Ride Along Trailer Ben wants to marry James sister Angela (Tika Sumpter ""A Madea Christmas"") and go to the police academy but James hopes to frighten him out of both ambitions by putting the fast-talking gamer geek in a series of hazardous situations over the course of one days ride-along. But wouldnt you know it Ben stumbles upon one clue after another and proves himself to a more effective sidekick than James originally thought. Theres nothing wrong with a familiar framework as long as the filmmakers can find a new way to amuse and thrill the audience. But writers Greg Coolidge Jason Mantzoukas Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi give us scene after scene of a sputtering Hart and a glowering Ice Cube despite the fact that they were brilliantly funny in respectively ""Think Like a Man"" and ""Barbershop"" their previous collaborations with ""Ride Along"" director Tim Story. See photos 2014 Movie Preview 60 Upcoming Winter amp; Spring Films - From Paranormal Sequel to Transcendence How lazy is this script? Hart bluffs like a tough-guy in a strip-joint scene thats nearly identical to Murphys legendary ""48 Hrs."" showdown in a redneck bar. Sumpter as the films only female character with more than five lines of dialogue eventually gets stuck being a hostage. Theres a ""surprise"" twist that any attentive viewer will see coming from miles away. The first driving-through-a-fireball sequence happens during the opening credits. And Hart refers to a bearded-lady biker chick as a ""thing."" Twice. The movie cant even find a way for ""SNL"" cast member Jay Pharoah to use his talents for either comedy or mimickry instead wasting him on a nothing bit part as a twitchy snitch. See video Bill OReilly Knows Ice-T From Ice Cube...

(Universal) C+ Ride Along Genre Comedy; Starring Kevin Hart Ice Cube John Leguizamo; Director Tim Story; Release Date Wide 01/17/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 100; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Pictures Posted January 27 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Is this finally Kevin Harts moment? The high-pitched high-strung comedian with the manic motormouth delivery has been killing it as a stand-up for a while now but despite a long resume of TV and film roles he still hasnt found that elusive crossover hit. His new comedy Ride Along could do the trick but it mightve helped if it were a smarter funnier movie. Hart plays an Atlanta security guard about to propose to his girlfriend (Tika Sumpter). Before he does though he needs the blessing of her intimidating cop brother (Ice Cube) who ropes him into being his patrol partner for a day to prove his worthiness. Ride Along is a generic slapdash odd-couple flick -- the fast-talking pip-squeak vs. the fearsome pit bull. Still Harts exasperated dervish shtick has moments of real live-wire anarchy including one priceless gag at a firing range. Will it be enough to make Hart a household name? Maybe. But both he and his fans deserve better. C+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Running time 100 minutes Rated PG-13 (profanity violence sexual references). At the Kips Bay the 34th Street the Magic Johnson others. ""Ride Along"" tries to be a comic version of ""Training Day"" only theres nothing in it as funny as Denzel razzing Ethan. Theres nothing much funny in it at all. Ice Cube plays James a cop who cant stand Kevin Hart which is pretty easy to imagine only unlike Cube I still couldnt stand Hart at the end. Hart plays Ben a Paul Blart type who dreams of being a supercop and eagerly agrees to go on a daylong ride with James the kind of tough undercover man for whom a routine investigation into some forged passports somehow turns into a shootout and a drive through a fireball. Cubes James doesnt want his beautiful sister Angela (Tika Sumpter) to marry Ben a half-pint gamer nerd who calls himself ""Blackhammer"" on his super-soldier video game and once set fire to James at a barbecue. So the cop figures hell haze the younger man for a day and this will somehow keep the little guy from becoming his brother-in-law. The movie depends entirely on how funny you think Kevin Hart is. All I see is a twitchy little rooster who needs to switch to decaf or remove his finger from the nearest electrical outlet. He jerks and jukes his way through the movie begging us to laugh and crashing into stationary objects. His models seem to be Chris Tucker and Eddie Murphy but Tucker was infused with nuttiness whereas Hart just seems to be trying too hard. Hed do better learning some of Murphys 80s cool. The script rumbles along from one little-guy joke after another. James sends Ben to ask some biker outlaws to move their hogs and lil Ben is immediately surrounded by menacingly large hairy dudes. Theres nowhere to go with that scene except for a lame gag about a bearded lady so we move on to a playground where Ben gets in an argument with a small child who bests him. Then its on to a shooting range where Ben is so wee he gets thrown against the wall by the kick from firing a shotgun. Cube is a pro at playing gruff and street-smart so its tiresome to watch him reduced to lobbing lazy insults at his motor-mouthed would-be partner. ""Hes about one chromosome away from being a midget"" is the best of these. If small stature together with talking fast and occasionally breaking into a high-pitched scream are all Hart has going for him I fear his career is going to be . . . short.

Kevin Harts motor-mouthed zinger-a-minute comic delivery does what it can to enliven ""Ride Along"" a lazy and listless buddy-cop action-comedy that fades from memory as quickly as its generic title. Opening in the post-awards-season January doldrums this Universal urban programmer should score some quick cash from fans of Hart and co-star/producer Ice Cube but seems unlikely to match the success of director Tim Storys previous collaborations with these stars 2012s ""Think Like a Man"" (91 million domestic) which featured Hart and 2002s Ice Cube vehicle ""Barbershop"" (75 million domestic). The 5-foot-4 Hart who projects some of the manic man-child energy of the young Jerry Lewis is well cast here as Ben Barber an Atlanta high-school security guard who dreams of becoming a real cop and of proposing to his longtime live-in girlfriend Angela (Tika Sumpter). But first he must win the approval of Angelas stern older brother James (Ice Cube) who happens to be a hard-bitten detective with the Atlanta PD. James meanwhile believes sis can do better than this diminutive nebbish who spends all his spare time playing videogames and so plots to give his prospective brother-in-law a crash course in the grit and gristle of real police work by allowing him to ""ride along"" for one day on his beat. One can marvel that it took four credited writers to come up with the ensuing cavalcade of moth-eaten comic situations which include Ben running afoul of a surly biker gang and getting lifted off his feet by a shotguns kickback at the firing range. (All thats missing is a car chase in which someone knocks over a fruit stand.) Even in such hackneyed routines Hart can be fun to watch especially when he goes toe-to-toe with one menacing perp whom he mistakenly thinks is a plant put there by James to test his mettle. But the movie doesnt offer much for Cube whos too innately likable to be convincing as the disapproving authority figure. (He glowers and grimaces a lot but underneath it all we know hes a big softie from the start.) Even less well served those resourceful character actors John Leguizamo and Bruce McGill saddled with throwaway roles as respectively a cop with an all-too-obvious secret and a blowhard sergeant who constantly scolds James for playing by his own rules. The movies only mildly clever conceit not exploited nearly enough is that Bens many hours logged playing a ""Call of Duty""-style combat videogame have left him with an encyclopedic knowledge of military-grade weaponry -- a skill that helps him to unearth a couple of clues in a major case James has been working. This in turn leads ""Ride Along"" down the dreariest of cop-movie alleys including central-casting Serbian terrorists and a mysterious crime lord named Omar whos so stealthy no one even knows what he looks like. When Omar (played by a semi-surprise guest star) finally shows his face during the obligatory abandoned-warehouse climax he suffers from what Roger Ebert memorably termed the ""Fallacy of the Talking Killer"" droning on at such length about his nefarious plans that our heroes have multiple opportunities to turn the tables on him. ""Ride Along"" quotes directly from such genre touchstones as ""Training Day"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" while indirectly calling to mind the likes of ""Bad Boys"" ""Midnight Run"" and this past summers ""The Heat"" -- all of which offered more dimensional characters and more inspired ways of navigating this well-trodden ground. Story who also directed Foxs slyly self-mocking ""Fantastic Four"" movies seems as bored by the material as the audience delivering action and jokes with a base level of technical competence but no particular flair.

Reel Junkie has written a similar one http//thereeljunkie.com/2014/01/27/film-review-ride-along-2014/ Ride Along was SUCH a disappointing attempt at resurrecting a tired story. Reply Richard Romero says January 15 2014 at 633 pm Scott I was hoping for this film to hit it out of the park Reply ted says January 15 2014 at 156 pm I have viewed a couple of the clips...just more racist drivel. Reply Joe Smart says January 15 2014 at 918 am I didnt know anyone liked Tim Storys Fantastic Four movies. I think calling them slyly self-mocking is giving everyone involved way too much credit.

""When I go to the movies"" these fans say ""I dont want to think I just want to see a movie."" I dont agree with that -- if you just want to watch pretty moving images without thinking buy a kaleidoscope. But there is something to be said for movies that keep you from thinking about other things. Take ""Ride Along."" Its not going to win any awards. In fact youre probably not going to remember it a year from now. But it has a few laughs a surprise or two and at least one hardworking actor. It only has a small job to do -- to divert. But it does it. The action-comedy stars Ice Cube as an in-your-face Atlanta cop and Kevin Hart as the excitable wannabe who wants a shot at the Police Academy -- and also the mans blessing to marry his kid sister (a purely decorative Tika Sumpter). But hows he going to do that? Why by impressing on a daylong ""Ride Along"" -- one that the grumpy police officer has designed for maximum discomfort. Both characters invoke ""Training Day"" with its sudden explosions of violence. However theres a lot of ""Rush Hour"" here too -- Hart yammers away so constantly so screechingly that you wonder if he has to cut royalty checks to Chris Tucker. The thing is though that Hart can be genuinely funny -- he is one of those comics who will do anything for a laugh and some things twice -- and he is tireless. Nearly boneless too from the shots of him (or his stunt double) getting bounced off walls like a rubber ball. What he doesnt get to do here is play much of a consistent character -- hes trash-talking brave or jelly-spined scared as the jokes require. Nor is Ice Cube called upon to do much more than glower. But director Tim Story -- who directed Ice Cube in ""Barbershop"" and Hart in ""Think Like a Man"" -- knows his actors strengths and weaknesses and mostly plays to the first while trying to hide the second. The plot - which has the cops looking for a mysterious crime figure known only as ""Omar"" -- is serviceable enough too. And although Story is bad at staging firefights -- there are two extended gun battles where its hard to tell exactly whos shooting whom -- hes better at fistfights and car chases. And yes there are plenty of both. So did I think a lot of ""Ride Along""? Not really. But I saw it after a pretty long and lousy day and Ill tell you one thing For 100 minutes I didnt think about anything else at all. And yes sometimes that small relief is the best thing a movie can give. Ratings note The film contains strong language violence and sensuality. Ride Along (PG-13) Universal (XX min.) Directed by Tim Story. With Ice Cube Kevin Hart.
