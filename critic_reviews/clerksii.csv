Dante and Randall the title characters in Clerks operated under the tagline ""Just because they serve you ... doesnt mean they like you."" In the sequel the working-slacker ethos is still worth a laugh -- and still a good way to frame humor guaranteed to offend. ROBERT SIEGEL host Its 12 years since movie audiences were introduced to Dante and Randall the title characters in the independent comedy Clerks. The film was set in a Quick Stop convenience store and its tag line was Just because they serve you doesnt mean they like you. Bob Mondello says theyve warmed up just a little in Clerks 2. BOB MONDELLO movie critic The opening shot shows Dante raising the metal door that covers the Quick Stop storefront. It and he are in black and white as they were in the first movie. Whats inside though is orange and yellow. The Quick Stop is in flames. (Soundbite of Clerks 2) Mr. JEFF ANDERSON (as Randall Graves) I left the coffee pot on again didnt I? MONDELLO Thats Randall the video store guy who is still Dantes best buddy even in color. They are 12 years after the first movie no longer 20. Theyre now thicker in the waist and possibly even thicker in the head. Still having the same sort of moronic conversations they did at the Quick Stop. After the fire though they have them at their new place of employ the cow-themed hamburger joint Moobies. (Soundbite of Clerks 2) Mr. BRIAN OHALLORAN (Dante Hicks) What are you writing over there anyway? Your memoirs? Mr. ANDERSON Im battling this jackass on his blogs message board. Mr. OHALLORAN About what? Mr. ANDERSON On how hes got too much free time and no life. Its this guy in a wheelchair thats always preying on everyones sympathies writing these long diatribes about how hell never walk again and how walkers should appreciate the blessings of their functioning legs. So Ive been getting into it with him throwing it back in his stupid crippy boy face about how I love to just sit around and how Id rather drive to the end of the block than walk. Mr. OHALLORAN The guys in a wheelchair. Mr. ANDERSON Yeah. Thats why I called him crippy boy. Have a good one. MONDELLO If you find that exchange amusingly appalling rather than just appalling then Clerks 2 once called the Passion of the Clerks may be right up your alley. Its a lot like the first movie though with higher profile supporting players like Wanda Sykes Jason Lee and Ben Affleck joining the likes of Jay and Silent Bob. Theres also a plot this time admittedly a loose one mostly about Dantes upcoming ill-advised marriage. His boss played by Rosario Dawson tries to advise him as hes painting her toenails. (Soundbite of Clerks 2) Ms. ROSARIO DAWSON (Becky) Come on Dante. She was the girl who wouldnt give you the time of day back in high school. And years later after shes played the field and realized how unsatisfying the so-called hotties are shes finally gone with someone who looks - Mr. OHALLORAN Oh my God. Youre going to say fugly arent you? Ms. DAWSON Unconventional Mr. OHALLORAN Oh nice back pedal. Ms. DAWSON Thank you. MONDELLO Director Kevin Smith perhaps knowing that this romantic stuff will play to an older demographic than the first movies sex drugs and video chatter did has included one new younger clerk Elias played by a very funny Trevor Fehrman who has absorbed pop culture without processing it particularly. Elias thinks Frodo and Gandalf are gods. He sneers at Luke and Leia and he is hilariously ill-informed about sex. His naivete serves to counteract some of the raunch in the films grossest conceits a donkey sex scene for instance. The director has five more pictures under his belt than when he made the first Clerks so the sequel has a more polished look which does not work in its favor particularly. But the working slacker ethos is still fun in Clerks 2 as is the fact that the film has something to offend most people over say well puberty really. Im Bob Mondello. Copyright (c) 2006 NPR.

Mercifully Clerks II is also a return to form for the bearded auteur who revisits super-slackers Dante and Randal ten years later only to discover that they remain losers in both life and love. This time around the undynamic duo have gained a few pounds and swapped the mini-mall for a fast-food joint up the road but little else has changed. Their days still revolve around foul-mouthed arguments concerning the relative merits of the usual Smith suspects (Lord of the Rings Star Wars and of course Jesus) while their prospects show no sign of improving.As with the original Clerks II is driven by a series of outrageously lewd and crude vignettes rather than anything even approaching a plot while the acting is largely amateurish (though Rosario Dawson does provide sparkle and sex appeal as Dantes beguiling boss Becky). Yet while the film is rude and raucous throughout it doesnt have a bad bone in its body providing a joyous celebratory swansong for the beloved characters; if this really is the end of the View Askew universe (as Smith claims) then its a fitting finale for the indecent ensemble. That said having visited the characters in their twenties and thirties it would be a shame if Smith didnt check up on them in their forties just to see how the Clerks deal with the difficulties of middle age.

By Peter Hartlaub Published 400 am Friday July 21 2006 Photo DARREN MICHAELS Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 Jeff Anderson Brian OHalloran Jeff Anderson Brian OHalloran Photo DARREN MICHAELS Who says aging slackers cant be funny? 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Clerks II Comedy. Starring Rosario Dawson Brian OHalloran and Jeff Anderson. Directed by Kevin Smith. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The best way to enter Kevin Smiths ""Clerks II"" is with a cynical mind-set assuming that its just another movie sequel that didnt need to get made. Convince yourself that the characters have been strip-mined in comic books a TV series and movies since ""Clerks"" became an indie sensation more than a decade ago -- and didnt Smith say he was going to move on after ""Jay amp; Silent Bob Strike Back"" came out in 2001? Whatever your expectations they will almost certainly be exceeded by Smiths hilarious and creative return to low-budget cinema. The continuing adventures of Dante and Randal are just as amusing as the first ""Clerks"" film and the story line has an unexpected sincerity that will remind this movies aging slacker target audience of ""The Breakfast Club"" and Smiths best film ""Chasing Amy."" ""Clerks II"" is almost as unpolished as ""Clerks"" but that seems to be part of the point. The movie is the end of a full-circle journey for a director who tried making films that satisfy film school instructors and mainstream critics but who will always be more comfortable making cinema that amuses regular people. The fourth paragraph is as far as anyone can go in good conscience before pointing out that ""Clerks II"" -- even more than its predecessor -- is not a film for everyone. More specifically its not a film for people who cant find humor in live donkey sex shows. I think this is a very good film but you probably wont agree if your favorite TV programs are ""Sue Thomas F.B.Eye"" and reruns of ""Diagnosis Murder."" ""Clerks II"" begins with the fiery demise of the Quick Stop the bunker-like New Jersey convenience store where Dante (Brian OHalloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) have been toiling for the past decade. They end up at a fast food burger franchise called Moobys although Dante is engaged and about to move to Florida with his ridiculously hot wife -- where a house and job from his father-in-law will free him from slacker limbo. For the first 15 minutes or so Dante and Randal fall into a comfortable pattern throwing around pop culture references while we catch up with new and old characters. The ""Clerks"" Greek chorus of Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith) went to rehab and found Jesus although theyre still dealing drugs. Randal in particular seems to continue resisting the idea of growing up particularly when he argues with a dorky younger employee named Elias -- peaking with a funny diatribe about the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy being better than ""Lord of the Rings."" (""Three movies of people walking to a f -- volcano"" Randal gripes.) The movie gets thrown off its axis when Moobys manager Becky (Rosario Dawson) arrives. Everyone was uniformly raw in ""Clerks"" so the shortcomings of the actors were less of a distraction. When the talented Dawson comes on screen in ""Clerks II"" the others are challenged to keep up. The plot is all over the place at times and the decision to shoot mostly in color instead of ""Clerks""-style black-and-white only serves to highlight the films blemishes. But Dawson turns out to be a necessary ingredient propelling the emotional core of the film forward while somehow convincing the audience that a smart attractive woman could find a schlub like Dante desirable. The movie only gets better when the love triangle becomes a quadrangle with Randal exploring his completely heterosexual yet still powerful feelings for Dante as well. With criticism for Smiths paint-by-the-numbers ""Jersey Girl"" still in his rearview mirror the director seems to relish packing his movie with out-of-nowhere moments -- whether its a go-cart race with a Burt Bacharach soundtrack or a choreographed acid flashback of a musical number. Its clear that this is a very personal movie about some of the struggles Smith has faced in Hollywood. (For the same crowd that still hasnt figured out after three ""X-Men"" films that the movies are about Martin Luther King and Malcolm X heres a short glossary of ""Clerks II"" symbolism Dante = Kevin Smith; The Quick Stop = small-budget personal filmmaking; Florida equals Hollywood; and Jason Mewes = Jason Mewes.) But even when this movie is wrong it still feels right. It was a good idea to make ""Clerks II"" -- and it may simply be Smiths destiny to revisit these characters every decade or so. After enjoying this movie the prospect of watching Randal as an 80-year-old starts to make sense. -- Advisory Where to start. ... This movie contains George Carlins seven dirty words strung together in every imaginable combination vivid talk about controversial sexual positions vivid talk about sex with minors racial epithets food tampering dozens of blasphemies scenes with strong allusions to bestiality and a bunch of other stuff were probably forgetting.

Jeff Anderson left and Brian OHalloran reprise their roles as Randal and Dante in Clerks II. Photo The Weinstein Co. Fans of the first will find plenty to love in Clerks II 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Readers Take this quick-n-easy test To gauge your likely response to Clerks II the new Kevin Smith movie sharpen your No. 2 pencils and answer five multiple-choice questions. Before you start know this. Clerks II is neither the best nor the worst installment in Smiths Jersey-centric ""askewniverse"" but fans will find plenty to feed their obsession. The film revisits best pals Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) and Dante Hicks (Brian OHalloran) 10 years older doughier and not much wiser. They hold McJobs at Moobys the fictional burger joint thats appeared in much of Smiths handiwork. Unlike the original Clerks II is shot mostly in color. Like the original it follows a star-crossed day on the job. And like the original the action covers a rooftop scene a hooky-playing scene riffs on movie trilogies a scene in which Dante accuses Randal of ruining Dantes life and scenes of Dante juggling two adoring babes Rosario Dawson as his Mooby manager and Jennifer Schwalbach (Smiths wife) as his fiancee. As expected all such scenes include hyper-graphic sex talk and escalating customer vituperation. But on to the quiz. 1) You thought the first Clerks released in 1994 was A) one of the (expletive deleted) funniest (expletive deleted) movies ever (expletive deleted) made. B) a post-modern thesis on sexual intimacy suburban ennui morality in the Star Wars universe and accidental necrophilia. C) the work of the devil 2) You regard Kevin Smiths films which also include Dogma Chasing Amy and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back as A) (expletive deleted) genius. B) an energetic if flawed body of work that reflects the writer-directors devoutly unorthodox Catholicism his omnivorous command of pop culture and his hair-frizzingly profane vocabulary. C) the work of the devil 3) You think dancing dope peddlers Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself) are A) (expletive deleted) hilarious. B) in desperate need of an iPod but isnt it nice that Jay has six months sobriety in AA? C) the spawn of the devil 4) Clerks II introduces us to Mooby employee Elias (Trevor Fehrman) whos obsessed with J.R.R. Tolkein Transformer bots and ""Pillow Pants"" -- a troll that lives in his girlfriends ... forget it. This strikes you as A) see 3A. B) supremely bizarre but see 3A anyway. 4) ????? 5) Finally when informed that Clerks II includes both a Ben Affleck cameo and a scene of bestiality involving a donkey and a large bald human in Samp;M gear your gut reaction is A) (expletive deleted) cool. B) sudden and debilitating nausea. C) the work of the devil HOW TO SCORE Add three points for every ""A"" response 2 for every ""B"" and 1 for every ""C."" 13-15 points Youll love it. 9-12 points Youre in that nether world between greatly amused and profoundly repulsed. See it but go for popcorn during the donkey bit. 5-8 points No (expletive deleted) way. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 6 Pairs of Alpine Swiss Mens Dress Socks for 7 + free shipping Xlong 20-Foot Solar Pool Heater Panel for 88 + free shipping Carbon Fiber Pattern Case for iPhone 6/6 Plus for 1 + free...

Yet its precisely devotees of the Smith universe (porn jokes cruddy camera angles surprise flights of grunge eloquence more porn jokes) who have a right to be wary of a Clerks sequel. Can Smith after finding fame and fortune beyond the mini-mall parking lots of New Jersey now successfully revive the talky dead-zone limbo of postadolescent wage slaves whose lives are going nowhere? Can he recapture the store-as-movie-set authenticity of the original film? How about its innocently sacrilegious horndog wit? The answer of course is that Kevin Smith can recapture all of this -- or at least enough of it to make Clerks II an agreeable mischievous romp instead of a rip-off -- because he never truly abandoned it in the first place. Clerks II unlike Clerks has been shot in color and given the semblance of a plot -- will Dante Hicks grow up into a responsible citizen? -- but really the movie like Clerks is a low-budget excuse for talk dirty talk dorky talk obsessive pop-culture talk (which is better The Lord of the Rings or Star Wars?) great gushing geysers of talk much of it prickly and obscene and hilarious and in that Kevin Smith way so smart about being stupid that the characters verbosity becomes in every sense their saving grace. In Clerks II the Quick Stop has been closed down due to a fire. Dante (Brian OHalloran) the neurotically rational wheel-spinning underachiever who looks like Charlie Sheen after being whacked with a geek stick and Randal (Jeff Anderson) that spiky even less evolved specimen of dedicated...uh randiness now work the counter of a Moobys fast-food franchise. They wear goofy purple uniforms that if possible mock their status even more than the Godot-at-the-Ring Dings-rack atmosphere of the convenience store did. Slinging burgers and onion rings to the rare customer who wanders into the place they jabber in their nothing-matters/everything-matters way about such vital topics as Transformers the Proustian joy of go-carts the issue of whether two particular body parts should ever meet during sex and also whether either of these two human zeds plans to get you know a future. Dante at least wants one. At 33 he has a tawny domineering fiancee (Jennifer Schwalbach) and hes planning to go with her to Florida where hes to spend his life running a car wash. The complicating factor is Dantes boss played by Rosario Dawson -- convincing as a rival love interest though not necessarily as the manager of a Moobys. The romantic plot is standard-issue but the real love story -- the one between Dante and Randal -- is brought to a satisfying even touching conclusion. And I havent even mentioned the donkey sex or the way Jay (Jason Mewes) with boom-box backup from Silent Bob (Smith) massages his nips as he replays the killers dance from The Silence of the Lambs. Talk about touching.

The follow-up to the 1994 cult hit plays as a money grab from a writer and director running out of ideas.

New Jerseys most famous and profane slacker-filmmaker now 36 remains obsessed with high school the ""Star Wars"" trilogy hard-core pornography and offensive language. Twelve years after the low-budget ""Clerks"" made a name for Smith with its quotable crude epigrams hes made a sequel. Or perhaps its just a remake. ""Clerks II"" repeats all the charms and flaws of the original with a far less forgivable outcome since Smith is now in a position to do far better. Perhaps the only thing more annoying than a misanthropic slacker is a group of now-successful actors and filmmakers pretending they are still slackers. Hiring people who couldnt act was a badge of honor in 1994 when Smith made the first ""Clerks"" for 27000. Mix in a few real actors like Rosario Dawson for ""Clerks II"" and you get a Big Gulp of a mess. ""Clerks II"" plays as a money grab from a writer and director running out of ideas. To recap ""Clerks"" followed a day in the life of post-high school losers Dante (Brian OHalloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) as they shirked duties and argued with customers at a backwater New Jersey convenience store. They ended the day resolved to take college courses and find better work. ""Clerks II"" opens with that Quick Stop burning down and Dante and Randal taking worse jobs as uniformed help at a burger joint called Moobys. Arrested adolescence has extended into their 30s though Dante is about to escape to Florida with a hot fiancee whose daddy will give him a car wash to run. Smith doesnt write dialogue so much as a series of self-contained speeches. His actors never seem natural theyre just waiting for whoever is talking to finish their part of the script so a new rant can be launched. Nothing Dante said in ""Clerks"" would change what Randal was about to say or vice versa. OHalloran in particular is the most wooden of actors a vague smile on his lips whether appropriate or not and never quite masking a look of terror over whether hes properly memorized the next lines. Tolerable in ""Clerks"" his faults glare openly here as a romantic opposite to Dawson whose perky knowing smile could make even Silent Bob talk. Smiths writing hasnt progressed beyond perfecting his delight in immaturity. His boys are terrified of seeming gay; they hire a donkey-porn act for a going- away party (lunch-spoiler alert depicted graphically on screen) and argue nonstop about Transformers vs. Ranger Danger. ""Sometimes I feel like the world left us behind a long time ago"" laments Randal. Ya think? ""Clerks II"" winds up in a convenience store again. Lets not hold our breath for ""Clerks III"" when Dantes kids are 12 years old and trying to buy cigarettes from Randal. A third installment would only have the entire audience echoing Dantes timeless lament ""Im not even supposed to be here today.""

Comments Clerks II Kevin Smiths sequel to his 1994 indie classic about two aimless New Jersey buddies is as dead-end as their jobs. Dante (Brian OHalloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) now sling fast food at Moobys whose slogan--""Im Eating It""--pretty much describes the experience of watching this movie. In place of the sharply etched observational humor of the original which featured a host of no-name actors in memorably quirky performances we now get mostly raunch and some flaccid cameos from Smith cronies Ben Affleck and Jason Lee. The leads arent as charming under the deadweight of a linear plot involving Dantes travails with his fiancee (Jennifer Schwalbach) and his boss (Rosario Dawson the films brightest spot) and the climax--an ""interspecies erotica"" bachelor party--leads to a depressingly sappy ending.

"Slackers only slightly grown up - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Slackers only slightly grown up By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  July 21 2006 Class reunions are funny things. People show up looking for their younger selves while trying to convince everybody else theyve grown up. The old rallying cries sound vaguely silly coming from men equipped with love handles. And the angst and anger and boredom of early adulthood have been replaced by the last thing a kid wants to hear about sentiment.All that and you wouldnt miss it for the world.So it is with Kevin Smiths long-awaited ``Clerks II"" which might better be termed a low-class reunion. The 1994 original was a blast of straight-outta-Jersey bile shot in black and white and paid for out of the loose-penny cup by the cash register. Foul-mouthed dirty-minded mostly hilarious it was Smiths way of climbing out of his own convenience-store McJob and helped kick - start the mid-90s indie-film boom.Smith went on to ``Chasing Amy "" and ``Dogma "" got married had a kid then took a tumble with 2004s ``Jersey Girl "" a perfectly OK heart-tugger that had the misfortune of getting caught in the Ben Affleck/J-Lo pile-on. With ``Clerks II"" the director retreats to home turf but is Smith playing it safe or is he really interested in seeing how the old nabe has changed?Bit of both actually. Dante (Brian OHalloran ) the hapless check-out drone of ``Clerks"" is now 32 on the beefy side and working at a fast-food franchise called Moobys (the beloved Quick Stop having burned to the ground). Hes engaged to an ambitious hot patootie named Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach  Smiths wife) and is on the verge of moving to Florida. At long last maturity beckons so why is he terrified? Is it because he yearns for his boss Becky (Rosario Dawson ) a more grounded (not to mention gorgeous) Jersey girl?The script by the way does what it can to convince us that Rosario Dawson might conceivably be found running a strip-mall restaurant. Personally Im not buying it. But Im not arguing either.While Dante is sizing up belated adulthood his best friend Randal (Jeff Anderson ) has regressed even further. OHalloran looks his age but Anderson appears to have awoken from a cryogenic sleep same baseball cap twisted on backward  same dead-eyed contempt for the world same delight taken in extreme political incorrectness and torturing the Normals. When Dante chides him for insulting a handicapped woman Randal snorts ``Its not like shes Anne Frank."" Helen Keller you mean? Whatever.``Clerks II"" notes where things in this cultural dead end have changed and where theyve stayed the same. Out in the parking lot Jay (Jason Mewes ) and Silent Bob (Smith) are still selling weed but theyre fresh out of rehab and Jay insists (in language unfit for a family newspaper) that he has found Jesus. Of all the reassembled cast Mewes looks as if hes been through the worst but his devil-boy fury seems tamed here.The movie tries to have it both ways and comes out addled and sweet. There are some scathingly funny exchanges between Randal and Dante as the former vents against ``The Lord of the Rings "" trilogy and tries to insist that the phrase ``porch monkeys"" is not a racial slur. Cue Wanda Sykes as an outraged customer to straighten him out as well as Ben Affleck and Jason Lee in pitch-perfect cameos.At the same time Smith impulsively throws in a musical number -- you start out shaking your head in disbelief but it keeps getting bigger and bigger and you finally give in -- and he slowly raises the stakes in Dantes relationship with Becky. The word ``love"" is tossed around more than once even by -- horrors -- Randal.Has Kevin Smith gone soft? Yes and no. True he lets Dante pour his soul out late in the film with a passion the one time Quick Stop clerk would have scorned (and which unregenerate ``Clerks"" fans will probably ridicule). But please note that the scene takes place against the (unseen) backdrop of a live sex act with a donkey. So what if you cant go home again? According to ``Clerks II"" home is wherever you park your ass. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Rating R for sexual and crude content including aberrant sexuality strong language drug materialRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesOpens today nationwide Inspired moments are too few in Clerks II Updated 7/21/2006 937 AM ET E-mail | Print | By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Kevin Smith has grown up even if his films havent. That might explain why Clerks II cant quite decide how old it wants to act. This sequel to the 1994 original has some inspired moments of the gross-out humor that made the original a cult smash. But amid those moments Smith also displays the tendencies of a slick sometimes formulaic Hollywood director. The shift can be jarring. One moment were in the middle of a sentimental flashback. The next someone is having sex with a donkey. The movie begins as the original did with Dante (Brian OHalloran looking an awful lot like Ricky Gervais) opening the Qwik-Stop for yet another tedious day of selling cigarettes to minors and quarreling with customers. But when the store goes up in flames he and Randal (Jeff Anderson) decide that its time to move up in the world -- to Moobys fast food. The premise has promise particularly with early cameos from customers Ben Affleck and Jason Lee. But instead of skewering the monotony of everyday life in blue-collar New Jersey as he did in the original Smith overstuffs his characters with crises and emotional complexity. Dante is getting married moving to Florida and uncertain about love. Randal is fretting that he has done nothing with his life. Moobys store manager Rosario Dawson is grappling with her uncles cancer. Even Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith) who spent nearly all of the first film high and leaning against a wall have found religion peddling sermons along with their weed. There are still simple pleasures to be found. Mewes remains the combustible engine that powers Smiths comedies and his imitation of the serial killer from Silence of the Lambs is a gem. Smith cannily captures the feud between fans of Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings. And Dawson is a pure joy to watch. She turns what could have been a wince-inducing dance number into a sweet cliche. Its the crude humor that trips up the movie. Clerks wants to be two films in one and neither quite works. At some point Smith will have to decide how mature he wants his characters -- and movies -- to be.

"In Clerks II Kevin Smiths Jersey Boys Still Register washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Correction to This Article A July 21 Style review of the movie ""Clerks II"" misstated the budget of the original ""Clerks."" It was 27000 not 230000. In Clerks II Kevin Smiths Jersey Boys Still Register Jason Mewes left and director Kevin Smith reprise their 1994 roles. (By Darren Michaels -- The Weinstein Co.) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 21 2006 Kevin Smith made ""Clerks"" a talky black-and-white comedy in 1994 for 230000 and almost instantly became a harbinger of a new era in American independent film. ""Clerks"" starred unknown actors Brian OHalloran and Jeff Anderson as convenience store employees who spend a day exchanging pop-culture trivia slagging off customers and repairing to the roof for an impromptu game of hockey. It was vulgar steeped in geekdom and decidedly latitudinal when it came to drugs (the supporting characters Jay and Silent Bob played by Jason Mewes and Smith were small-time dealers). Lewd crude and parentally unacceptable ""Clerks"" nonetheless became a generational touchstone and Smith became a hero for his brutally affectionate portrayal of post-adolescent aimlessness. Twelve years later Smith has made ""Clerks II"" as a gift to those who through ""Mallrats"" and even ""Jersey Girl"" have stuck by their man. (The film is full of in-jokes and cameos from Smiths rep company.) Like its predecessor ""Clerks II"" is a foulmouthed panegyric to the lowest common denominator stooping ever lower for laughs with jokes that usually have something to do with sex drugs or ""Star Wars."" But like so many of Smiths flicks as he calls them ""Clerks II"" is shot through not just with the directors love of mischief but with his signature brand of humanism one that combines self-deprecating irony with deep compassion. Even as they mark time speculating on deviant sexual positions say or the historical place of Jar Jar Binks in the cinematic canon you get the feeling that Smiths characters are really interrogating the very nature of meaning and moral discernment. Smith may be the one filmmaker working today who can so easily convey a sense of profound spiritual faith while shamelessly grubbing for laughs with an on-screen donkey act. So ""Clerks II"" finds Dante (OHalloran) and Randal (Anderson) at the theologically significant age of 33 each facing an uncertain future if not outright crucifixion Dante is set to marry his fiancee Emma (played by Smiths real-life wife Jennifer Schwalbach Smith who resembles a human mash-up between Karen Black and Ann Coulter). Randal still without ambition after all these years is bereft at the prospect of losing his best friend; its a setup similar to ""You Me and Dupree"" with the love interest fundamentally being between the two guys. Smith is not a distinguished visual artist and even as a writer his work is full of flabby gratuitous sequences (an out-of-left-field go-kart race for example). People love Smith for those ineffable moments of humor both raw and observant that only he seems able to deploy. So in ""Clerks II"" in which Dante and Randal have moved on to be countermen at Moobys (the Golden Calf from Smiths riotously devout ""Dogma"") we are subjected to Smiths escalating attempts to shock a running Anne Frank gag; some gloppy references to sex on a fast-food prep table; a riff worthy of Lenny Bruce regarding a particularly offensive racial epithet; that donkey. But were also treated to those Smithian pleasures that are all the more sublime for being couched in such outlandish tastelessness Randals argument with a dim colleague named Elias (Trevor Fehrman) about the scriptural implications of the Transformers; a similar diatribe regarding the relative merits of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings""; and a rapturous production number in which the hockey game in the first movie becomes a dance sequence set to the Jackson 5s ""ABC."" But by far the best excuse for seeing and celebrating ""Clerks II"" is the presence of two actors. Mewes who has famously battled heroin addiction is back at his motormouthed best delivering a performance as a newly clean and sober drug dealer that is both sly and moving. And Rosario Dawson is nothing short of heroic as a gorgeous Moobys manager worthy of Jane Austen possessed of both sensual exuberance and sharp intelligence. Dazzling and brave Dawson is reason alone to see ""Clerks II."" And she perfectly embodies why Smiths sensibility with its near-Platonic balance between the sacred and profane is one to be cherished. Its true of ""Clerks II"" but it could be said for just about any Kevin Smith movie For all the trash talk and trouncing of common propriety its real subject is transcendence. Clerks II (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for pervasive sexual content and crude humor including allusions to aberrant sexuality strong profanity and some drug material.

Youll be shocked to learn that Dante and Randal are still doing the exact same thing standing around all day at their menial jobs finding ways to avoid work and talking. And talking and talking. Theyre just doing it in color instead of black and white. But in revisiting the characters who made him an indie darling and a cult favorite writer-director Smith finds himself back at the top of his game especially after his most recent offerings the self-indulgent ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" (2001) and the soft-hearted ""Jersey Girl"" (2004). ""Clerks II"" goes disastrously awry in the third act -- almost irreparably so -- but before that when the insults are flowing and the graphic banter is crackling the film frequently achieves a rhythm thats hilariously infectious. (Its OK -- go ahead and give into it. Theres a 12-year-old boy inside all of us and ""Clerks II"" reaches out to give him a reassuring hug.) The sequel begins where the 1994 original left off in grainy black-and-white at the suburban New Jersey Quick Stop where Dante (Brian OHalloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) have toiled away mindlessly all these years. Only the place is on fire -- causing ""Clerks II"" to shift cleverly into color and forcing the duo to find jobs they hate somewhere else. They end up at Moobys a sort of evil Disneyfied fast-food chain where Rosario Dawson plays the impossibly cool sexy manager Becky with whom Dante shares an unlikely chemistry. Dawson is effortlessly lovely as always and yet fits comfortably into Smiths twisted universe. (The filmmaker said it best when he remarked that she makes you actually believe that Becky would have sex with Dante. Were paraphrasing here but you get the idea.) Also joining the crew is virginal Elias (the endearingly jumpy Trevor Fehrman) a co-worker whos freakish even among Smiths usual misfits and comic-book geeks. Elias finds himself drawn into some of the most protracted heated discussions with Randal the instigator -- such as which is better? ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings""? -- the kinds of debates that members of Smiths loyal fan base surely have had themselves in the comfort of their parents basements. Advertise Advertise Advertise Meanwhile drug dealers Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself) stand outside the restaurant all day just as they stood outside the convenience store. They serve as both Greek chorus and inane distraction -- Jay frantically dancing and enjoying the sound of his own voice Silent Bob chain smoking and letting his eyebrows do the talking -- and provide some of the most staggeringly raunchy moments of all. (It is good though knowing that were seeing Mewes clean and sober on screen for the first time after years of drug addiction.) Theres a plot too such as it is. ""Clerks II"" unfolds during Dantes final day on the job before heading to Florida with his fiancee the perky blonde controlling Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smiths real-life wife). Randal who loves Dante in a totally hetero way doubts that his best friend is truly happy with this woman; at the same time Becky also hopes hell stay for her own secret reasons. As Dantes confusion mounts ""Clerks II"" builds toward its thunderous climax. And unfortunately we mean that literally. Smith leaps brazenly into the abyss when he has Randal throw a going-away party for Dante at the restaurant complete with ... um ... how to phrase this? Theres a donkey a stage disco lights and a smoke machine. It goes too far for too long and Smith just does not know when to rein it in (if youll pardon the pun). Or maybe he just doesnt care. Smith wont win any new converts with ""Clerks II"" but hell satisfy the devoted core audience. And for passing fans who longed for his low-budget roots hell remind you of what you stopped in for in the first place. (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"Clerks II | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; clerks-ii ) Clerks II (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its interesting to note that as Kevin Smith has changed and matured as a filmmaker he has elected to close the circle and look back from a perspective of a dozen years at the movie that put him on the indie map Clerks. Clerks II is a direct sequel to that movie albeit one that transpires a decade later - the first such movie Smith has done (although many of his films have featured cameos by characters from other pictures). It feels both the same as and different from its predecessor the same in that the script is constructed around a truckload of nearly X-rated gags and different in that Smith is peddling a message. Clerks II may have a heart but it gains it by jettisoning a portion of its funny bone. Dont misunderstand - this is a funny movie. It delivers plenty of laughs but it isnt in the same league as Clerks. I left that movie holding my stomach from laughing so hard. With this one I was smiling but my diaphragm had not been given a workout. And Smith has something to say this time around. (I remember him making this comment about Clerks at a personal appearance ""Theres no message at least not one I consciously put in there. Its just a bunch of dirty jokes."") With a theme that may be as much a defense of his gentler style of movie-making (evident in Jersey Girl) he notes that aging changes people. The aimlessness of youth is replaced by a desire to make ones mark on the world. Theres also the friendship angle that friendships - true friendships - can outlast everything. As Clerks II opens the Quick Stop is burning to the ground bringing to a close an era for long-time convenience store clerk Dante Hicks (Brian OHalloran) and his best buddy video store clerk Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson). No matter - both of them find other employment this time as burger flippers at the fast food joint Moobys. A year later Dante is about to leave New Jersey for good heading off to Florida where he intends to wed his fiancA(c) Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach). It doesnt matter that his real love is his boss Becky (Rosario Dawson) since she doesnt have Emmas money or connections and she doesnt believe in romantic love. Randal is devastated by his friends departure but he tries not to show it. And fundamentalist Christian/Lord of the Rings fanatic co-worker Elias (Trevor Fehrman) who idolizes Dante is equally distressed. Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) dont care one way or another - they just do what they always do hang around outside and deal dope. Clerks II contains plenty of pop references - The Lord of the Rings vs. Star Wars Transformers racial slurs - as well as countless jokes 95% of which would be enough on their own to earn the film its R rating. The volume is down from Clerks as is the ratio of hits to misses. This is indicative of how difficult it is for any director to mine the same territory twice. In fact its remarkable that Smith has developed something with as much wit as Clerks II exhibits. Despite not achieving the level of the original (which arrived as a breath of fresh air blowing through stuffy art houses) this is the most amusing comedy to arrive in months. The acting is predictably mediocre with one exception. Smith is committed to bringing back the original cast including Brian OHalloran Jeff Anderson and a rehabbed Jason Mewes. Its no surprise that these guys have essentially played these parts (and no others) over the course of the last 12 years. They were amateurs when Smith recruited them for Clerks and their thespian skills have not been honed in the intervening years. OHallorans forced rushed delivery of certain lines robs them of whatever power Smith invested them with during his writing. Jennifer Schwalbach Smiths wife plays bitchy Emma a two-dimensional caricature shrew. The aforementioned exception is Rosario Dawson who imbues Becky with passion and humanity. Dawson is so much better than anyone else in the cast that her presence in the film accentuates their deficiencies. Had someone less accomplished gotten the role perhaps OHallorans stiffness wouldnt have been as obvious. Clerks II has its share of serious scenes and while not all work on an individual level the aggregate is effective in making the movie more than a pointless exercise in scatological jokes and bestiality gags. (Try as he might Smith fails to out-gross Tom Green from Freddy Got Fingered.) Also despite OHallorans limitations as an actor the relationship between Dante and Becky is effective. In fact its one of the two cornerstones of Clerks II (the other being the Dante/Randal friendship). Its hard to say whether this is the last visit to the View Askew New Jersey Universe. (Smith makes sure we know where the film is set - hardly a scene goes by without a verbal or visual reference to the state.) At one time he vowed to retire this group of characters after the release of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back but that didnt happen. Clerks II is a marked improvement over Jersey Girl which may be an indication that Smiths strength lies with these people. The question is whether theres anywhere else to take them or whether there needs to be.

Gentle feeling of nostalgia pervades this hit-or-miss sequel which relocates the gang to the ninth circle of fast-food restaurant hell. ""Clerks"" cultists will need no kicks in the groin to step up to the counter. Its Dante and Randal who strike back in ""Clerks II"" a softer flabbier and considerably higher-budgeted follow-up to Kevin Smiths 1994 indie sensation that nevertheless packs enough riotous exchanges and pungent sexual obscenities to make its 97 minutes pass by with ease. Politically incorrect raspberries and the umpteenth appearance of Jay and Silent Bob aside a gentle feeling of nostalgia pervades this hit-or-miss sequel which relocates the gang to the ninth circle of fast-food restaurant hell. ""Clerks"" cultists will need no kicks in the groin to step up to the counter for this second go-round courtesy of the Weinstein Co. Brief prologue neatly dispenses with both the Quick Stop supermarket and the black-and-white aesthetic from the original film forcing New Jerseyites Dante Hicks (Brian OHalloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) to move on to the Technicolor glory of Moobys. Behind the counter of this cow-themed burger joint (where menu items are prefaced with words like ""udderly delicious"") affable Dante and confrontational motor-mouth Randal continue their routine of doing nothing in particular occasionally reporting to manager Becky Scott (a sassy Rosario Dawson). Dante has grown unusually close to Becky in recent months despite the fact that hes engaged to a perky control freak (played by Smiths real-life wife Jennifer Schwalbach Smith) and intends to start a new life with her down in Florida. The use of color may strike some auds as a concession to the mainstream (the first ""Clerks"" wore its grungy monochrome like a badge of honor) as might the prominently played and occasionally gooey scenes of romantic flirtation between Dante and Becky some of which involve toenail-painting. Yet if ""Clerks II"" doesnt have quite the scabrous kick of its predecessor the chance to revisit a classic premise must have renewed the writer in Smith whose banter here often achieves a sharpness and quality that havent been in evidence since 1999s ""Dogma."" In addition to all the gags quips and extended rants about subjects like masturbation anal-oral contact bestiality sex with pickles and the difference between Anne Frank and Helen Keller Smith is at his best as a self-implicating satirist of geek culture. The apex is a genuinely inspired debate between Randal and lower-ranking employee Elias (Trevor Fehrman) about the relative merits of ""Star Wars"" vs. ""Lord of the Rings"" (""Theyre three movies about walking""). Whats missing is a colorful gallery of customers comparable to those who wandered in and out of the Quick Stop in the original pic. The best ""Clerks II"" can do is cough up brief cameos from Smith regulars Ben Affleck and Jason Lee as well as a typically noisy display of attitude from Wanda Sykes. And of course drug-dealing wall-leaning duo Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) are back in the flesh still contributing nothing to society in mildly amusing fashion. As a director Smiths visual command remains strictly rudimentary though perfectly suited to his ambitions. Final scene which briefly reverts back to black-and-white has the wistful feel of both a return and a farewell. Clerks IIProductionA Weinstein Co. release of a View Askew production.
