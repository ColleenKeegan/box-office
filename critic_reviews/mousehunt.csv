But closer inspection of this not uninteresting hybrid - part family fare part subversive fantasy - reveals that this delicately composed film shares stronger bonds with the work of Terry Gilliam than John Hughes.

Down the road ancillary prospects are even rosier. Mouse Hunt"" is the cats meow. Blending the graceful slapstick of Laurel amp; Hardy with the mock Gothic visuals of ""The Addams Family"" this often screamingly funny comedy about a resilient rodent has enough across the board appeal to click with audiences of all ages. Even though it faces stiff B.O. competition in the current holiday season demolition derby pic could eke out enough coin to qualify for sleeper status. Down the road ancillary prospects are even rosier. Nathan Lane and Lee Evans (""Funny Bones"") are ingeniously teamed as Ernie and Lars estranged brothers reunited by the death of their aged father string manufacturer Rudolph Smuntz (the late William Hickey). Ernie the cynical owner operator of a pretentiously trendy eatery wants to sell the old mans factory a cavernous antique that appears to be a holdover from the earliest days of the Industrial Revolution. But the far more sentimental Lars wants to preserve the family business and swears fealty to his fathers motto ""A world without string is chaos."" Unfortunately Ernie loses his restaurant -- and gains a great deal of notoriety -- when his most famous customer the city mayor dies of a heart attack during a lavish meal. Just as unfortunately Lars is booted out of his house by his shrewish wife (Vicki Lewis) who cant understand why her husband wont accept a firm offer for the string factory. So the two brothers must take advantage of another inheritance from their late father a dilapidated mansion thats been vacant for several years. Shortly after they move in they discover the place is an architectural masterpiece that may be worth millions. Trouble is an incredibly crafty mouse has made the mansion his home. And he wont leave without a fight. First time feature helmer Gore Verbinski -- a commercial director best known for introducing the ""Budweiser frogs"" -- does a nifty job of quickly establishing and skillfully sustaining a kind of fractured fairy tale stylization. ""Mouse Hunt"" begins on a darkly humorous note as the two bicker-ing brothers inadvertently disrupt their fathers funeral. It takes awhile for Adam Rifkins clever screenplay to place Ernie and Lars in the man-sion and in conflict with the mouse. But once the brothers start to match wits with the rodent pic becomes an amusingly twisted live action cartoon with Lane and Evans playing increasingly frustrated Wile E. Coyotes to the mouses indefatigably resourceful Roadrunner. Throughout most of ""Mouse Hunt"" the four legged title character is impressively portrayed by a real mouse -- well OK several real mice -- under the supervision of animal trainer Boone Narr. Children will be especially delighted by scenes in which the mouse scurries and jumps across floors and onto shelves. Even so Stan Winstons Animatronic mice are even funnier particularly when the action is viewed from the rodents point of view. When Lars hammers strips of wood across baseboards the mouse sees nails the size of redwoods crashing through the wall. Later when the brothers try to flood him out with a garden hose the plucky rodent looks very much like a panicky bit player trapped below deck in ""Titanic."" But the most special effect in ""Mouse Hunt"" is the well timed give-and-take between the top billed human stars. Lane mixes sharp tongued sarcasm and self satisfied fussiness to create a character who echoes Oliver Hardy and occasionally Groucho Marx. (A mischievous in joke Lane who provided a key voice for Disneys ""The Lion King"" quotes that animated blockbuster while greeting a guest.) Evans has some hilarious moments of herky jerky physicality when the generally sweet natured Lars is repeatedly outwitted and enraged by his four legged adversary. Together the two leads bring out the best and the funniest in each other suggesting that future screen pairings may be in order. Among the supporting players Christopher Walken is a standout with his self mocking portrayal of an obsessed exterminator whose professionalism borders on dementia. Debra Christofferson and Camilla Soeberg are amusing as two zaftig sisters who dont mind being pawed by the mouse hunting brothers. Other first rate comic turns come from Maury Chaykin as a multimillionaire who wants to buy the mansion Lewis as the wife who wants to sell it and Eric Christmas as the lawyer who cant quite figure out whats going on. A frail Hickey appears only in a hospital room flashback. But his character manages to dominate the proceedings thanks to a portrait that periodically changes expression to punctuate the action. The well known character actor died shortly after completing work on ""Mouse Hunt"" and the pic is dedicated to his memory. Production design by Linda DeScenna is an invaluable asset. In addition to creating the dilapidated mansion she also designed a spectacularly grim city pound for the brothers to visit when they go looking for a mean mouse hunting cat. Composer Alan Silvestri provides a playful mood enhancing score. Other tech credits add to the fun. Mouse HuntProductionA DreamWorks Pictures release. Produced by Alan Riche Tony Ludwig Bruce Cohen.

Their dying fathers string factory is making a loss; Ernies position as a chef has just been terminated; and dimwit Lars couldnt hold down a job even if he tried. Then father dies leaving them the factory and a decrepit country mansion. As luck would have it though the house is worth a fortune so the pair set about restoring it for auction. Theres just one obstacle a territorial mouse with an attitude problem. This film comes over as a mix of Laurel and Hardy Home Alone and Tom and Jerry and it works very well. Lane is especially funny his deadpan Hardy-esque mannerisms working perfectly against Evans winsome Laurel-inspired character and theres a memorable cameo from Walken as a manic exterminator. It looks good too the generous use of wood and autumnal colours giving it an earthy almost timeless appearance. Exceptional effects.

Comments Mouse Hunt Christopher Walken briefly plays an exterminator who takes his work very seriously and one or two of the special effects provide a momentary sensation of novelty. But this desperately all-ages movie just emphasizes its banality by throwing money and effort into effects and production design at the expense of pacing--perhaps the most crucial element in comedies that furiously juggle many objects and actors. The derivative fable follows two brothers (Nathan Lane and Lee Evans) whose father has died leaving them a nearly obsolete string factory an old house of questionable value and inadvertently a persistent mouse. The satire--a thin veneer for the storys real mission destroying everything in sight--is undermined by the usual tension between characters who value expensive possessions and endless gags that involve wrecking them as if this will teach the greedy characters not to be so materialistic. As always a happy coincidence inverts the lesson. Written by Adam Rifkin and directed by Gore Verbinski. 97 min.

Starring Nathan Lane Lee Evans Christopher Walken. Directed by Gore Verbinski. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) An extraordinarily cute and clever mouse is the main attraction in ""Mouse Hunt"" the new comedy starring Nathan Lane and British comic Lee Evans as bumbling brothers who inherit an old house on a hill. Think ""Tom and Jerry"" meets ""The Three Stooges."" Thats the tone of this wacky tale an over-the-top slapstick movie for families. ""Mouse Hunt"" opens today at Bay Area theaters. The mouse though no ""Babe"" hogs the movie -- and why not? The filmmakers have created a rodent as lovable as it is wily using real mice a computer-generated mouse and animatronics. First-time feature director Gore Verbinski won a Clio Award for his Budweiser frog commercials. SOME GAGS ARE INSPIRED ""Mouse Hunt"" is inane antic cinema in the extreme. But even if half the gags dont quite work the other half are inspired -- especially a riotous sequence when the mouse runs amok at an auction and flees into a beehive hairdo and down the low- cut blouse of a buxom woman. Also juicy is the beady-eyed little heros confrontation with a menacing cat. ""Mouse Hunt"" has a dark wintry look that seems almost Dickensian. If off-putting it is also apt since the focus of the fun is a creature that lives in a shadowy world inside walls and under floorboards. The plot is so goofy it makes Saturday morning cartoons look deep. Ernie Smuntz (Lane) and brother Lars (Evans) face hard times when their stern father owner of a string factory dies and leaves them nothing but the familys tumbledown mansion. Their first impulse is to unload the sprawling Victorian dump. But when they find out that its an architectural masterpiece perhaps worth millions they decide to move in refurbish it and sell it at a big profit. Theres only one hitch -- the single-minded mouse. The film cleverly shows the mouse do ing only mouselike things to which the brothers consistently overreact. Gradually the focus shifts to the desperate plight of the brothers so it seems that the mouse is somehow getting more clever and even a little maniacal -- yet its still doing only what a mouse would to survive the unwanted guests and construction chaos. The brothers are afraid of the mouse of course. Their campaign soon escalates from brooms and clubs to mousetraps. The mouse gingerly avoids them and the traps end up snapping on Lars in places it hurts. The mouse ransacks the kitchen scurries into walls causes a terrible sewer line backup and seems unhampered in ruling the roost. Perhaps the most amusing sequence is when Christopher Walken shows up as Caesar the exterminator looking ready to fight World War I single-handedly. His eccentric gestures carry the moment when his methodical approach is upended. CAVING IN FROM MOUSE CHAOS Ernie (Lane) is the smarter of the brothers but hes also closer to caving in emotionally to mouse havoc. Evans as Lars is dopey but optimistic. His zany physical style seen in ""Funny Bones"" with Jerry Lewis comes across as a bit stilted here. Broadly comic performances rule the picture Vicki Lewis as Lars wife April; Eric Christmas as a lawyer; Maury Chaykin as a greedy millionaire. Of the current batch of family movies this ""Mouse"" clicks.

But closer inspection of this odd but not uninteresting hybrid--part bright broad family fare part subversive fantasy--reveals that this delicately composed first feature from commercial director Gore Verbinski shares stronger bonds with the work of Terry Gilliam than with the oeuvre of John Hughes. Set in a wet gloomy landscape thats supposed to be timeless Delaware but might just as well be Victorian England the comedy follows the mousehunting chores of Ernie and Lars Smuntz (Lane and Evans respectively) squabbling brothers who have inherited a mansion. When the dilapidated house turns out to be the valuable work of an architectural master the boys decide to sell; the vermin however thwarts all efforts at eradication. Charles Gibson who did so well by pigs in Babe conjures sweet visual effects but the charms of Evans (from 1995s oddball Funny Bones) and Lane (whos at his best playing to the balcony) are lost in all the detailed hubbub.
