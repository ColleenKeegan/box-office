Directed by Renny Harlin from a screenplay by Michael France and Sylvester Stallone. Oak Tree Lewis amp; Clark City Centre Factoria Kent 6 Kirkland Parkplace Aurora Village Alderwood Valley 6 Gateway 8 Everett 9. ""R"" - Restricted because of violence profanity. ------------------------------------------------------------------- ""Cliffhanger"" resembles the old stereotype about heavyweight boxers and defensive linebackers. Its physically impressive requires huge amounts of resources (reportedly 70 million) to sustain itself is the product of considerable training and discipline moves with noteworthy speed . . . and has the intelligence of a Presto-Log. The fact that so much money was lavished on such a thick-headed project represents the height of fiscal ineptitude but this is the kind of roller-coaster ride for which eager audiences will gladly check their brains at the turnstiles so go figure. In a plot that could be summarized on a postage stamp Sylvester Stallone plays an expert mountaineer who after failing to prevent the death of a fellow climber goes into a major funk and quits his post on the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team losing his nerve and his girlfriend/colleague (""Northern Exposures"" Janine Turner) in the process. Just when our hero needs an opportunity to regain all hes lost a band of nasties led by Eurotrash villain John Lithgow hijacks a jet carrying 100 million in cash being transferred by the Denver branch of the U.S. Treasury. When the hijacking goes sour Lithgow amp; Co. abduct Stallone and his climbing pal (Michael Rooker) to retrieve the three cases of big bucks that have landed in the treacherous Rockies. From there its a race for the cash because Rooker Stallone and Turner are only useful as long as they can guide Lithgow to the money. After that theyre dog meat. This film exists only to thread together a series of ""breathtaking"" action sequences that seem to deliberately avoid logic. Its the kind of film in which an idiot villain will fire into a tenuous snowbank causing the avalanche that kills him and in which Stallone emerges from an ice cave at precisely the spot where a villain just happens to be waiting. Hmmm . . . just what are the odds of that I wonder? And wont that pointy stalactite come in handy when Sly has to dispatch the guy? Youve got to reluctantly admire the gutsiness that took director Renny Harlin (""Die Hard 2"") into the Italian Alps where his daring crew risked life and limb for a few good thrills. But the sheer physicality of this production (which doesnt hold a candle to the climbing sequences in the IMAX movie ""To The Limit"") means nothing without a genuinely stimulating story. Remove the thematic depth and psychological complexity that David Lean brought to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and it would be far more difficult to appreciate Freddie Youngs stunning cinematography. Likewise even an action movie must engage the common sense that ""Cliffhanger"" neglects or we will return its disrespect for our intelligence. The grand finale is awesome and silly at the same time and Lithgow indulges his best campy badness since ""Buckaroo Banzai"" stealing the best of the clunky dialogue that was heavily rewritten by Stallone. But with end credits that run for nearly 7 minutes ""Cliffhanger"" has recruited an army of Hollywoods finest technicians for what amounts to a barely adequate skirmish.

Not boxing per se (although he does a little) but simply holding on. Virtually every action sequence in this picturesque alpine adventure culminates with Stallone as a park ranger named Gabe Walker dangling from some vertiginous precipice a couple of digits hooked on a rock and his legs swinging in the air thousands of feet above an icy canyon floor.Directed by Renny Harlin the transplanted Finn whose other big action pic Die Hard 2 was likewise adrift in snow (the mega-budget films also share a couple of harrowing airplane sequences) this Rocky Mountain high concept is at its best when the good guys and bad guys are grunting across altitudinous terrain racing for a few suitcases loaded with cash that fell from the sky.Once they start talking however things get draggy. The villains led by John Lithgows gleeful sociopath deliver the requisite spate of ruthless one- liners but more often than not the malevolent zingers fall flat. And the conversation between Stallones Walker - a rescue ranger who has lost his nerve after letting an inexperienced climber literally slip through his fingers - and his ranger girlfriend (Janine Turner) is even worse. The couples exchanges are a whirl of cliches.With the Italian Dolomites substituting for the Colorado ranges Cliffhanger is spectacularly handsome. Snowcapped peaks jut against blue skies and sheer walls of rock drop to treelines of fir. Harlin and his crew use swooping helicopter shots to capture the majesty of it all and there are some magnificent screenwide vistas tiny human figures rappelling and running along huge mountainscapes. The cinematography and gravity-defying stunt performances are exhilarating.The story alas is pure routine. A Treasury Department jet loaded with fresh 1000 bills is hijacked over the Rockies but the plane is hit by bad weather (and gunfire from a wounded Fed) and goes down. Stranded on a summit the diverse troop of trigger-happy psychos radio for help and get some. An unsuspecting Walker and his former partner Hal Tucker arrive to lead the crash party out of the mountains but instead find themselves forced at gunpoint to retrieve the money-laden baggage.Michael Rooker (Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer) plays Tucker who has had a er falling-out with Walker. The buddies dispute is designed to add a little tension to the drama but theres never any doubt about whose side Tucker is going to come down on. Nonetheless Rooker makes a solid action hero in his own right and he gets off one of the films few successful retorts as he dispatches a brutal British henchman with a quip about his soccer aspirations.Cliffhanger boasts a couple of especially violent scenes one involving a thoroughly stereotyped black villain played by the mono-monikered Leon. Leons gangster encounters Walker and his girlfriend Jessie in a cave and the resultant exchange appears to have no other purpose than to push a few buttons with a particular urban demographic group. Its gratuitous and distasteful.Along for the ride are Ralph Waite as an old pop of a park ranger; Paul Winfield in a bland Treasury official role; Caroline Goodall as Lithgows femme fatale and two MTV-generation mountaineers (a kind of Bill and Ted of the aerie-set) who have the misfortune to cross paths with the crooks.As for Stallone his musculature ripples and his brow furrows and thats about the extent of it. Having taken a credit on the screenplay Stallones probably as much to blame as co-writer Michael France for the prosaic dialogue - lines that make his limitations as an actor woefully apparent. Stallones better off just keeping his mouth shut and hanging on for dear life.CLIFFHANGER   1/2Produced by Alan Marshall and Renny Harlin directed by Renny Harlin written by Michael France and Sylvester Stallone photography by Alex Thomson music by Trevor Jones distributed by TriStar Pictures.Running time 1 hour 58 mins.Gabe Walker - Sylvester StalloneQualen - John LithgowHal Tucker - Michael RookerJessie Deighan - Janine TurnerFrank - Ralph WaiteParents guide R (violence profanity)Showing at area theaters Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

The films first 15 minutes in fact are actually suspenseful.During this prologue you meet Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) and two other members (Michael Rooker and Janine Turner) of the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team who are attempting to save an inexperienced climber. While not especially graceful this section of the film - which shows the teams desperate struggle to keep the climber from plummeting - certainly holds your interest."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;No the moviegoers rapid descent doesnt begin until the plot really kicks in and the heroes do battle with a gang of ruthless thieves whose airplane has crash-landed in the mountains.At any point from then on the next splat you hear may be your own.What makes you feel so lousy at Cliffhanger is its relentless pounding violence. This summer blockbuster (or potential blockbuster) may be the most sadistic mainstream movie to come along since - well gee when was the last Rambo flick anyway?Of course Stallone gets part of the blame. Not only does he star in the film (which opens today) he co-wrote the exploitative screenplay with newcomer Michael France.But theres enough blame to go around and surely director Renny Harlin deserves some.In fact Cliffhangers peculiarly acrid variety of sadism is similar to that of Die Hard 2 which Harlin also directed. This guy has about the same relation to the director of a truly exciting action film as a jackhammer operator has to an orchestras tympanist.This isnt the sort of movie that demands great acting and Cliffhanger doesnt get it. The closest the film comes to an interesting performance is John Lithgows droll Master Thespian turn as the leader of the thieves.As rescue-team member Gabe Walker Stallone just sort of huffs and puffs his way up and down the mountains. There hasnt been so much heavy breathing since - well gee when was the last Madonna movie anyway?Rooker (Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer) and Ralph Waite (TVs The Waltons) - who play other rescue-team members - are bland. As for Turner who is cast as yet another team member she is somewhat surprisingly rather more human-seeming than you might expect from watching her anchor-babelike nonperformance on TVs Northern Exposure.But that small pleasant surprise means next to nothing in the context of a blood-and-guts-o-rama like this one.You dont have to be one of those zombies who are obsessed with banning violence in movies to recoil from the level of exploitation in Cliffhanger. As the beatings and explosions and gunfire and whatever keep coming the films ugly spirit could get to just about anyone.By the end of the picture your question isnt so much Will our heroes triumph? as How will I ever scrape myself up off the floor of the movie theater?Its a question that each one of us must answer for him or herself."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORELottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoDo your homework before painting or sealing cool deckPuerto Rico birth certificates How to get a new oneLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida Lotto"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt; Related ArticlesWhen It Comes To Suspense Cliffhanger Hits New HeightsJune 4 1993Cubs 1st Baseman A Hit With TurnerJuly 6 1993More Than Exposure - cliffhanger For TurnerOctober 14 1992Index by Keyword|Index by Date|Privacy Policy|Terms of ServicePlease note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors reporters or any other editorial staff.",http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-05-28/entertainment/9305281284_1_cliffhanger-gabe-walker-sylvester-stallone,200,cliffhanger2,cliffhanger,orlandosentinel

"Movie Reviews  Not Much Plot to Hang Onto  Cliffhanger has plenty of mayhem high-flying stunts and sadistic fight scenes but the story falls short. - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Reviews  Not Much Plot to Hang Onto  Cliffhanger has plenty of mayhem high-flying stunts and sadistic fight scenes but the story falls short.May 28 1993|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC Someday theyll make an action picture that manages to do without a plot. Someday theyll figure out how to squeeze so much mayhem into two hours that it wont matter who is doing what to whom. But for now no matter how spectacular the stunts are they still have to be connected to a scenario and as long as thats the case films like ""Cliffhanger"" (citywide) are going to continue to fall short.Make no mistake the high-flying stunts in director Renny Harlins film are definitely state of the art and while theyre going on the film works up a serious level of excitement. But as soon as the action stops and the inevitable talking begins ""Cliffhanger"" falls to earth with a considerable thud.Though director Harlin has claimed presumably with a straight face that he took this project on because it would give him ""more in terms of character and relationships"" than his previous ""Die Hard 2"" and despite a rather involved writing credit (screenplay by Michael France and Sylvester Stallone and a screen story by Michael France based on a premise by John Long) ""Cliffhanger"" has the kind of dramatic texture that would look undernourished in a comic book.Stallone obviously did more than take a pencil to the films inconsequential script he also stars as Gabe Walker mainstay of the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team specialists in helping those stranded in the unforgiving snows of Colorado.After a challenging on-site experience that is perhaps ""Cliffhangers"" best sequence (so dont come late) Gabe decides the mountains are no longer for him. He wants his sweetheart and fellow rescuer Jessie Deighan (Janine Turner veteran of TVs equally snow-bound ""Northern Exposure"") to leave as well but she thinks thats an offer she can refuse.While Jessie and Gabe exchange insights about the vagaries of human behavior ""Cliffhangers"" other plot shoe drops. A Treasury jet carrying exactly 100 million is attacked by hijackers and soon the cases of money as well as the plane come crashing down right in Jessie and Gabes neck of the woods.Eric Qualen (John Lithgow) the oh-so-evil genius who heads the hijack crew decides he needs professional help locating the 100 million not to mention getting back to town. And quicker than Jack Frost Jessie Gabe and teammate Hal Tucker (""Henry Portrait of a Serial Killers"" Michael Rooker) all end up on top of the mountain going toe to toe with the desperadoes.Tucker is initially introduced as a character who bears a fearsome grudge against Gabe (could this have been the ""more in terms of character and relationships"" that Harlin was talking about?). But once the action gets started that enmity all but disappears as does any chance of memorable acting from anyone. Even Lithgow whose bravura villain role in Jim McBrides made-for-Showtime ""The Wrong Man"" was one of the delights of the Cannes Film Festival can only do so much with a part that seems to have been written for Alan Rickman.Seeing ""Cliffhanger"" also underscores what an act of sheer will it has been for Stallone to turn himself into an international action star. His career-making role in the original ""Rocky"" is still his best work and its mixture of light action and pathos remains his most successful acting path. Despite having bulked himself up into the appropriate body Stallone tends to come off as awkward when he does battle betrayed by a face that seems more sad and sensitive than believably heroic.Another problem for Stallone as well as ""Cliffhangers"" most offensive aspect is the way he insists on playing average guy Gabe as if hes more invulnerable than the Terminator. Both Gabe and Hal receive horrendous beatings from the bad guys that are extended well beyond the point of sadism beatings of a ferocity that would kill almost anyone yet they survive with hardly a noticeable aftereffect. It is not a pretty picture and if there was any sense in the ratings system it would earn this picture an NC-17 instead of its timid R (for violence and language).If you can survive those beatings and the exposition doesnt excessively bore you the beauty of the Italian Alps Dolomite range (which doubled for Colorado in Alex Thomsons crisp photography) and those action sequences (including dizzying climbing and some exceptional midair antics which are not sadistic) all function as advertised. ""Cliffhanger"" no doubt makes for a great coming attraction but as a two-hour movie its claims are much more problematic.CliffhangerSylvester Stallone Gabe WalkerJohn Lithgow Eric QualenMichael Rooker Hal TuckerJanine Turner Jessie DeighanRex Linn TraversCaroline Goodall KristelA Carolco/Le Studio Canal+/Pioneer production in association with RCS Video released by TriStar Pictures.

"Ghastly `Made In America Should Never Been Made - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Take 2. FRIDAYS GUIDE TO MOVIES amp; MUSIC. Movies. Siskels Flicks Picks.Ghastly `Made In America Should Never Been MadeMay 28 1993|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is ""Made in America"" an outrageously lame comedy about a subject that has served as the text of some very good films recently-interracial love. In movies as varied as ""Flirting"" from Australia and Spike Lees ""Jungle Fever"" black and white couples have seriously fallen in love and fought through the attendant problems.Maybe the easiest way to criticize ""Made in America"" is that not for a second do you believe that the characters played by Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson really like each other. At first theyre not supposed to but later. . . . That these two actors reportedly fell in love during the making of this film only makes their lack of chemistry more astounding.Goldberg plays a single mom who operates an African-centered bookstore in Los Angeles. She has an 18-year-old daughter (Nia Long) who was fathered by a donation to a sperm bank. Curious about the identity of her father the girl does some investigating and comes up with-much to her horror-the name of a sleazy car dealer played by Danson. Shes stunned but Goldberg is appalled.But rather than write characters that might approximate the intelligence of a street-smart car dealer in the nations most competitive car market or a strong-willed woman with enough smarts to operate her own business the authors of ""Made in America"" take the sitcom low road and play out the story at the eye-popping comic level. Danson plays a clown; Goldbergs character is a scold. Can her daughter bring them together? Will Smith from the genuine sitcom ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" also is reduced to playing a lame friend. And Danson looks wasted throughout the film. In addition to the screenwriter his makeup artist let him down.""Made in America"" is playing at the Burnham Plaza Water Tower Webster Place and outlying theaters. Rated PG-13. (STAR)Flicks Picks guide-(equals)New this week- CLIFFHANGER (Burnham Plaza McClurg Court Webster Place and outlying). Take away the mountains and what you have is a howlingly bad action film with a cornball villain out to steal a massive amount of United States currency from federal agents. Out to save the dough and assorted lives is mountain rescue ace Sylvester Stallone who has been in retirement ever since he incorrectly believed he was responsible for failing to save the life of a trapped climber. Typical of the stupidity here is that we can plainly see he wasnt at fault in the films opening scene. Later were treated to assorted predictable slips and trips and jumps and bumps. Did I mention slides? John Lithgow is a laughable villain which only makes the mountain scenery that much more impressive. But you dont go to a picture like this to stare at mountains. R. (STAR)- MADE IN AMERICA (Burnham Plaza Water Tower Webster Place and outlying). This weeks Flick of the Week. See above. Rated PG-13. (STAR)- MENACE II SOCIETY (Pipers Alley and outlying). A brilliant film of despair tracking the same emotional turf as ""Boyz N the Hood"" as we follow the development of a young African-American from Watts who is born into a violent world and plays out a predictable role in it as well. We root for him to triumph over tremendous odds knowing that it isnt likely to occur. If this sounds too downbeat to be entertaining you havent seen the exceptional filmmaking skills of the Hughes brothers 21-year old twins who trained themselves on video cameras. R. (STAR)(STAR)(STAR)(STAR)- SLIVER (Burnham Plaza 900 North Michigan Webster Place and outlying). A depressing experience. Sharon Stone trashes the impact she made in ""Basic Instinct"" by letting her papable on-screen spirit serve an empty screenplay about a single woman harrassed by two creepy guys one a trashy novelist (Tom Berenger) and the other a rich playboy (William Baldwin). One is a killer and the other is voyeur; both live in the same apartment building. The sex scenes have been cut or underlit to the point of boredom. As a result Stone is at her best when she sits in a bathtub far removed from either of the guys. R. (STAR)- THE STORY OF QIU JU (Music Box). The latest feminist drama from Chinas leading filmmaker Zhang Yimou ""Ju Dou"" and ""Raise the Red Lantern"" is another excellent film. He tells the epic story of a gutsy farm woman who defends her husband against an insult from a local government official. She demands justice and during her cross-country search for equity we meet Chinese characters who reflect a nation in transition. PG.

"Rockys Mountains - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Take 2. FRIDAYS GUIDE TO MOVIES amp; MUSIC.Rockys MountainsStallones `Cliffhanger Hits Dizzying HeightsMay 28 1993|By Dave Kehr Movie critic.`We like extremes"" remarks one of the minor characters in ""Cliffhanger"" a goofy SoCal teenager who likes parachuting off the peaks of rocky mountains.So too does Renny Harlin the Finnish-born action filmmaker who has now graduated from ""Die Hard 2 Die Harder"" to the even more extravagant even more hysterical ""Cliffhanger"" which stars Sylvester Stallone as a rock-climbing rescue worker caught up in a mad chase across a mountain range.One doesnt look to Harlin for subtle gradations of emotion delicate nuances of feeling. The new film is one maniacally extended almost unbroken series of high-risk situations most involving dizzying heights automatic weapons and grinning sadistic villains.Much of it is effective but much of it is just too much-too relentless too overpowering and too mean-spirited-to be the kind of rousing adventure it means to be.Harlins most effectively staged sequence is his opener in which Stallone as the angelically named Gabriel Walker comes to the rescue of his wounded partner Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) and Hals uneasy girlfriend Sarah (Michelle Joyner) who have gotten themselves stranded atop an immense needle-like promontory called ""The Tower."" (Although the film is set in the Colorado Rockies most of it was filmed in the Italian Alps near Cortina.)Unfolding some spectacular aerial photography of the region under the opening credits Harlin deftly sets his astounding outdoor stage using a combination of matte shots (in which actors are superimposed onto artifical backgrounds) and swooning camera movements to establish a breathtakingly effective sense of height.As Gabe climbs up the spire a bright red helicopter flies into view containing Gabes partner and companion Jessie Deighan (Janine Turner) and Frank (Ralph Waite) the helicopters crinkly-eyed avuncular pilot.Landing on a roomier nearby peak Jessie and Frank throw a cable across to Gabe; harnessed to it Hal and Sarah will be able to slide to safety. Hal makes it but then Sarahs belt breaks. Gabe scrambles out to save her but as he struggles to hold on to her her hand slips from her glove. She falls to her death.Harlin smoothly modulates the sequence from humor to panic to tragic impact. Although there are some shaky matches in light quality between the location long shots and the studio closeups (a problem throughout the film) this is filmmaking of a very high order depending for its impact on a Hitchcockian calibration of framing and cutting. The audience is gripped by pure form.Hitchcockian too is the reference the sequence makes to the opening of ""Vertigo"" most specifically in the way the scene fades to black before Gabe has climbed down leaving him metaphorically suspended over a void for the balance of the film.Flash-foward one year where Gabe his nerve mightily shaken has returned to the mountains from a long haitus; he wants to reclaim Jessie and take her back to the city.This of course is not to be.A radio call comes in to the rescue station asking for help for a band of amateur climbers about to be stranded in a major storm. The viewer knows as the characters do not that these climbers are in fact a band of ruthless super-criminals who after a not entirely smooth attempt to hijack a U.S. Treasury plane loaded with 100 million in fresh bank notes have crash-landed in the mountains.Led by the dastardly cold-blooded Qualen a renegade CIA agent (John Lithgow in exactly the kind of overripe role he should never be offered) the villains lure Gabe and Hal into their clutches; they need them to help locate the three cases that fell from the plane each containing one-third of the loot.The script by Michael France with a rewrite by Stallone provides Gabe with a distractingly large number of personal issues to resolve where one would have been more than enough-he needs to renew his romance with Jessie heal his broken friendship with Hal and regain the self-respect that went down with the unlucky Sarah.Harlin commits a similar and more literal kind of overkill by needlessly piling up corpses entirely too many of them belonging to sympathetic characters. If he needs to demonstrate just how ruthless Qualen and his band can be a single gratuitous killing would have more impact that the deadening half-dozen Harlin offers here. Harlin committed a similar misstep in ""Die Hard 2"" by crashing an entire jumbo jet full of innocent people. Its hard to regard any movie as an innocent romp after that. Mass murder does cast a nasty pall.""Cliffhanger"" could have used a little more of the humor that enlivens such moments as Gabe and Jessie warming their hands over a bonfire of 1000 bills. Says Gabe gesturing at the cave theyre sitting in ""It costs a fortune to heat this place.""1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesDistant past trumps recent past in adaptationJuly 29 2011The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (star)(star)November 8 2002Its Jet Li vs. Jet Li in `The OneNovember 2 2001Battling bros perk up the Kid plotMarch 24 2011`Flowers hymns hero-journalistsMarch 15 2002Find More Stories AboutFilmSarahSequenceTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-05-28/entertainment/9305280020_1_gabe-climbing-sequence,200,cliffhanger6,cliffhanger,chicagotribune

Comments Cliffhanger Its hard to think of a movie my feelings have been more divided on. An action adventure directed by ace craftsman Renny Harlin in spectacular mountain settings (supposedly the Rockies though most of the picture was filmed in Italy) this is often breathtaking and beautifully put together; the action never flags and despite the presence of Sylvester Stallone (who wrote the silly boys fantasy of a script with Michael France) sheepdog expressions and all the movie comes across as if somebody half-believed in it. On the other hand the brutality and sadism it delivers at every opportunity which were supposed to take for granted as part of the ""fun"" left me feeling that any civilization that can create such an entertainment may not deserve to survive; except for our recent turkey shoots in Panama and the Persian Gulf savagery has seldom been celebrated as shamelessly or as disgustingly. Maybe the way those scenic mountain vistas recall the pre-Nazi star vehicles of Leni Riefenstahl isnt just coincidence the movie seeks to make proto-Nazi thugs out of all of us. With John Lithgow Michael Rooker Janine Turner Rex Linn Caroline Goodall Paul Winfield and Ralph Waite.

You worry about Sylvester Stallone. For most of Cliffhanger he runs around in a T shirt atop a mountain range in the snow.

Its not just that they revel in speed noise outrageous thrills- Cliffhanger certainly provides all those things-but that their relentless kinetic thrust has no real logic no narrative ebb and flow; were simply invited to strap ourselves in and surrender judgment. A violent zap-a-minute thriller set in the spectacular Colorado Rockies (though much of it was actually filmed in the Italian Alps) Cliffhanger contains a few moments of lyrical pulse-quickening vertigo but its also packed with beatings knifings impalings shootings explosions. At one point Stallone is roughed up as badly as Rocky ever was-each punch lands with an apocalyptic thwack-and before that his partner (Michael Rooker) gets the same pounding treatment. Despite the dont-look-down Olympian settings Cliffhangers spirit is brutal and earthbound. The movie is like one of those computer-designed simulator rides that whip you around until youre dizzy and aching but dont actually take you anywhere. Its Die Hard V at 13000 feet. A crew of thieves led by-what else?-a psychotic British mastermind (John Lithgow) hijack a U.S. Treasury cargo jet and abscond with 100 million. When their small plane crash-lands leaving several money-filled suitcases scattered in the wintry mountains they call the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team and are met by two of its veteran climbers. Gabe Walker (Stallone) and Hal Tucker (Rooker) used to be friends but they havent spoken in months-ever since Walker in the films stupendously scary opening sequence tried to save Tuckers girlfriend from falling to her death. The two men are ordered at gunpoint to retrieve the lost cash. But Walker escapes and he and the thieves commence a lethal game of cat and mouse amid the peaks caves forests and deliriously plunging cliffs of the Rockies. The stolen-loot business is of course little more than an excuse to get Stallone and his foes up in the mountains. Once theyre there director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2) stages some amazing sequences. Theres one dizzying climax in which Stallone is whipped through the air on a long springy metal ladder finally battling Lithgow atop a helicopter thats jammed into the side of a cliff. At its best Cliffhanger has the enjoyable preposterousness of the Roger Moore James Bond films. Still I couldnt help wondering why Harlin barely even tried to match the elegant realistic terror of that perilous opening sequence. Cliffhanger delivers its quota of thrills but too much of the movie is devoted to the sort of kick-ass set pieces that would have worked just as well in urban alleyways as on mountaintops. This is a cliffhanging suspense film that doesnt exploit our fear of heights as much as our fear of getting blown away by machine-gun fire. As the evil Qualen Lithgow seems to be doing an impression of Anthony Hopkins. Hes amusing in a predictable way though he does have one shockingly nasty moment bumping off his most devoted crew member with a hair-trigger malice thats so nonchalant its funny. The ragtag script (credited to Stallone and Michael France) fails to establish the other villains-or for that matter the heroic Walker-as anything more than monosyllabic ciphers. Fortunately that strategy works just fine for Stallone. He may not be a wizard at delivering his lines but for an action star he has a wonderfully expressive face-that parrot mouth curled in defiance the dark burnished eyes that somehow manage to make macho rage seem sensitive. Here as in Rambo First Blood Part II series its exhilarating to behold the speed and sheer balletic confidence with which Stallone swings his overly-muscled body around. Like Rambo Cliffhanger seems to put him in the middle of a kamikaze fitness workout. He leaps climbs and runs; he uses one of the villains as a human toboggan; he gets into an epic scuffle with another baddie (this one played by the black actor known simply as Leon whom the movie tastelessly turns into a bloody-mouthed savage) and skewers him on a stalactite. Some may find the sheer relentlessness of Cliffhanger a big kick. Yet the movie would have been more fun had Harlin utilized the nooks and crannies of the mountaintop setting with greater ingenuity doing more to turn the Rockies into the worlds most intricate and treacherous jungle gym. A lot of the staging seems arbitrary When its time for another fight Harlin simply sticks two enemies on the same peak without a care as to how they got there. In spatial-logistical terms the film makes almost no sense (Die Hard for all its bombast did). Then again a roller coaster doesnt really have to make sense. It just has to keep moving.

""Cliffhanger"" lives up to its title as a two-hour rollercoaster ride that never stops. A high-octane action suspenser with thrilling vertiginous footage unlike anything seen before in a feature this is an ideal summer popcorn picture that will keep audiences collective palms sweaty and give Sylvester Stallone his first major international hit in some time. With a good guy seeking redemption and bad guys 200% evil the battle lines are as clear as in a cartoon or a World War II movie. But where most rugged he-man films feature a few action sequences scattered throughout director Renny Harlin keeps the adventure stuff in this reputed  65 million production coming at an astonishing pace. Each scene may not top the last -- in fact the two most amazing passages occur early on -- but despite its simplistic script ""Cliffhanger"" has few peers in the sheer quantity of visceral thrills. Nine-minute opening sequence is a heart-stopping stunner. Rocky Mountain Rescue pro Gabe Walker (Stallone) has climbed up a needle peak to help rescue an inexperienced climber the girlfriend of his partner Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker). But in a grippingly detailed succession of events the rescue goes awry  and the young woman slips out of Gabes grasp to her death thousands of feet below. When Gabe returns to Southern Colorado a year later hes unable to patch things up with his own g.f. Jessie (Janine Turner) and Hal still blames him for causing the accident. Having disengaged from friends and career in the interim Gabe isnt sure hes ready to rejoin the living and gets more than he bargained for by the challenge that is immediately foisted upon him. In the next-most-gasped-at sequence a private Treasury Department jet is hijacked by turncoat T-Man Travers (Rex Linn) who slips across a cord to another jet commandeered by the nefarious Qualen (John Lithgow) whose gang of mostly Brit baddies is expecting to collect  100 million from the heist. But the three suitcases containing the cash fall to the ground and the jet (in another amazing scene) makes a crash landing on a mountain stranding the band of villains in a gathering storm. Enter Gabe and Hal who arrive to rescue the group but are promptly captured and forced to lead them through the snowy icy terrain to the loot. So its the masters of the mountains vs. well-armed and particularly nasty adversaries. Many variations of cat-and-mouse are played as Gabe escapes and beats the others to some of the money Jessie choppers in and the nasties begin quarreling among themselves and are picked off one by one. The set pieces just keep coming including an avalanche a fight with stalagmites treacherous wolves and a fight in a river under ice. But the picture has got to scale the peaks one more time for the finale a literal cliffhanger involving Gabe and Qualen and a helicopter. Its another doozy. It was no doubt a lot more fun to think up all these scenes than to shoot them but on both counts the filmmakers have done their jobs admirably. Harlins headlong approach and breathless pacing maintain continual excitement but what really puts this in a class of its own is the verisimilitude of the action. Despite credits to stunt and climbing doubles and the occasional process shot  there is no doubt that Stallone and other actors were really up on the sides of mountains for many of the shots not to mention hanging precariously over distant gorges and ravines. The climbing and aerial footage in widescreen is remarkable throughout the weather rough the action utterly convincing. People with a strong fear of heights will get a workout. Tenor of the action is brutal and sometimes bloody but tension is the predominant keynote. Looking great Stallone is clearly into this one and it pays off in one of his most rugged screen appearances. Rooker Turner and Ralph Waite are fine as the other good guys while the baddies -- Lithgow (in what could be called the Alan Rickman role) Linn Leon Craig Fairbrass Caroline Goodall Denis Forest and Gregory Scott Cummins -- all try to outdo each other in defining pure evil. Although set in Colorado and partly filmed in Durango most of the picture was lensed in Italy near Cortina DAmpezzo in the Alps and in Rome. Locations are spectacular and tech contributions throughout are aces with Alex Thomsons lensing Frank J. Uriostes editing and Trevor Jones score all charging things up along with the virtuoso visual effects and stunt work.

When Gabe Walker (Stallone) fails to stop a girl falling to her death his nerve is broken and he leaves the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team and his lover Jessie (Turner). But a chance for redemption arises when he and now vengeful colleague Tucker (Rooker) are duped into rescuing a motley gang of villains who have lost three stolen Treasury coffers in an air crash in the high peaks. Director Harlin makes the most of the scenery but seldom manages to induce a tingling sense of vertigo. Fun for the undemanding but Stallones comeback should have been much tighter.

Yet another validation of Stallones manhood it de- tails the tediously Herculean feats of a tough but vulnerable rock climber in a battle against himself nature (""gravitys a bitch"") and a pack of internationally renowned psychos led by John Lithgow.Set against the scenic uplands of Colorado (actually the Italian Alps) its a ""Rocky"" Mountain High for none but the star who seems to think its Mount Olympus hes scaled. His brooding and flexing are given the epic treatment by the apparently awestruck Renny ""Die Harder"" Harlin whose direction goes beyond action-packing to relentless.The film opens with a spectacular shot of the Alps (Harlin thought them prettier than the Rockies) with the camera gradually closing on a lone climber dangling from a precipice. Gabriel Walker (Stallone) a cocky rock jock is attempting to rescue his injured partner Hal (Michael Rooker) and Hals girlfriend. Alas she falls to her death when she slips from Gabriels desperate grasp.Eight months later Gabe who has quit his job with the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team returns to Colorado to resume his courtship of a feisty helicopter pilot Jessie (Janine Turner). Jessie chides him for running away from his fears and urges him to return to the heights. ""It doesnt get any better than this"" she says citing the great philosopher Old Milwaukee. Still not convinced Gabe is about to leave when he and his estranged buddy Hal are obliged to go after a party of stranded hikers.After some wrangling they brave the snow and high winds to reach the imperiled hikers -- actually a vicious gaggle of gangsters who crash-landed during a spectacularly precarious midair hijacking. In the process theyve lost their loot -- 100 million taken from a Treasury Department jet -- and intend to get it back with Gabe and Hals help. They hold the two mountaineers at gunpoint but Gabe manages to escape.Stripped of his equipment and his swaddling climbing garb -- the better to see his ripples and bulges -- Gabe manages to find Jessie and a sweater. Then the pair set off in search of the dastardly Eric Qualen (the chop-licking Lithgow) and his rainbow coalition of cartoon bad guys. Gabriel now turned avenging angel is ready to climb every mountain and if necessary even yodel his manly expletives to save Hal and wreak vengeance on Qualen. Tenacious as edelweiss his gal Jessie clambers a few toeholds behind.At every turn theres a new challenge but Gabriel always outsmarts the allegedly clever Qualen a former British intelligence agent. Armed to the teeth and possessed of a hair-trigger temper Qualen kills anything that moves including most of his cohorts and a teenage camper who just gets in the way. Though hes ruthless even by Rambonic standards Qualen isnt an especially worthy opponent for Alpine Boy. He represents no greater evil no enemy of the American way -- the Japanese the Arabs the South Africans the Vietnamese. Hes just a black hat -- one size kills all. (If Lithgow isnt careful hell be reduced to hosting turkey shoots.)Stallone is coming home to the action genre after belly-flopping in the comedies ""Oscar"" and ""Stop or My Mom Will Shoot"" but hes still got the same problem. He hasnt got a sense of humor about himself; even Schwarzenegger has that much. Hes slightly more articulate than usual but the lines still fall from his lips like beaten boxers to the mat. Not that it much matters given the constant mayhem.""Cliffhanger"" which Stallone rewrote from Michael Frances screenplay is easily as mean-spirited as ""Cobra.""

"Cliffhanger | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cliffhanger ) Cliffhanger (United States 1993) A movie review by James Berardinelli Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) is a member of a mountain climbing rescue team. When one of his operations goes wrong and the girlfriend of his best friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) is killed Gabe blames himself and leaves. Eight months later after setting up a life in Denver he returns to the mountains to persuade his lover Jessie (Janine Turner) to come with him. While hes there a call for help comes in and Gabe decides to become involved in one last rescue attempt. However unknown to him the rescue call is a fake put out by a group of hijackers stranded in the mountains after the crash of their plane. Led by the psychotic Qualen (John Lithgow) theyre after three suitcases of money (100 million dollars) that are lost somewhere in the peaks and valleys of the Colorado Rockies. Hey whats a down-and-out street fighter from South Philly doing climbing mountains in a tee-shirt? Seriously though Sylvester Stallones newest character may be named ""Gabe"" but he takes an awful lot from the likes of men named ""Rocky"" and ""Rambo"". Theres also a little of John McClane in him as well. This is not an original or interesting personae and it shows what can happen when an actor becomes too-easily identified with one (or two) roles. To his credit Stallone tried to do something different (two comedies called Oscar and -- ugh -- Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot) but when the ""great experiment"" failed he returned to the genre where he made his money. Whether Cliffhanger will bring Stallones name back into the top echelon of action movie stars has yet to be determined but if this film cant the task may be impossible. The first scene typifies the entire movie. Theres a lot of action and a fair degree of tension (even though its pretty obvious whats going to happen). Stallones muscles are shown to their best advantage as he reaches out to save the life of a girl hanging by a thread. Bad dialogue abounds as does lame acting. ""Please dont let me die"" begs the girl at least half-a-dozen times before plunging to her doom. This is not an example of a well-written dramatic moment but its indicative of how all of Cliffhanger has been put together. When the film goes for drama it invariably fails. The dialogue is routine frequently punctuated by cliches and the character-building scenes do little more than waste time. One could argue that theres not enough action in the picture because of these long drawn-out sequences. They dont work so their inclusion damages Cliffhangers pace. The editing is suspect. The final product appears heavily cut. Numerous transition scenes have been trimmed in favor of the above-mentioned character moments. There are also several useless scenes featuring a couple of high school kids who have no purpose whatsoever in the overall storyline. Im sure none of the expensive shots were eliminated but the curious choice of what to use has given Cliffhanger an uneven tone. Renny Harlin showed in Die Hard 2 that he has skill when it comes to directing action sequences. This ability is evident in Cliffhanger. Sure the movie borrows from other action films (most notably the original Die Hard) but it does so in a big bold way and theres enough new stuff to keep scenes fresh. Unfortunately as strong as Harlin is with the mountains and hardware hes that weak with the actors. He gets little out of them seeming more interested in the next avalanche than a reasonably-delivered line. John Lithgow is surprisingly ineffective as the villain. Given his past track record one would think he would be perfect to play the Alan Rickman-clone (a smooth-talking British-accented psychotic whos out for the money). However the role is woefully underplayed and Lithgows Qualen becomes the least-hated member of his group of thugs and mercenaries. Cliffhanger takes pains to make us loathe the bad guys but its the ringleader that we have the least antipathy for. If youre in the mood for something thats completely visceral and mindless (really mindless -- the plot is a joke filled with contrivances and coincidences) this movie will fit the bill. Parts of it are excruciatingly bad but there are numerous examples of well-directed action that on balance compensate for the worst gaffes. This is a poor mans Die Hard. It has the explosions gunplay and spectacular stunts but little of the wit and intelligence. In other words its a typical summer action flick.

""Cliffhanger"" which kicks off this years blockbuster sweepstakes with a nasty cynical vengeance is a sober reminder to close down all mental activity. Just pull the plug on your judgment good sense and values. Remember to leave enough motor skills to face forward -- thats where the screen is.Its no surprise that this Sylvester Stallone vehicle was directed by Renny Harlin the one responsible for the calamitous plane-crash scene -- and other violent excesses -- in ""Die Hard 2 Die Harder.""In this further escalation of cruelty he provides the appropriate cliffhanging thrills -- when the movies at its best. But he concentrates most of his time on sheer brutalization. ""Cliffhanger"" is the modern equivalent of throwing Christians to the lions. Its an eroticism of nastiness -- triple-X fare for dirty old men in raincoats. If you resist this sleazy gorefest youll be right to feel proud of yourself.In a ""Vertigo""-like beginning the psyche (I use the term loosely) of Rocky Mountain Rescue climber Stallone is shattered by a catastrophic mishap. When he tries to save a dangling panicked climber -- the girlfriend of his pal Michael Rooker -- hes tragically unsuccessful.In the movies closest attempt at an internal moment he blames himself. Rooker blames him too. Stallone then quits the team and vanishes for eight months leaving helicopter pilot and girlfriend Janine Turner unaware of his whereabouts. Action movie heroes do that.The only thing thats going to get the Slyster over the guilt is another dangerous mountain rescue involving overwhelming physical punishment sheer-face climbing (in a wet T-shirt) avalanche evasion explosives evasion and a therapeutic round of bloody deaths.He gets his chance when psychotic villain John Lithgow and his bionic affirmative-action hench-persons (including black kung fu specialist Leon and English female pilot Caroline Goodall) commandeer a U.S. Treasury Department plane carrying 100 million.Lithgows hijacking plot goes awry when the plane crashes in the mountains and scatters the money (in three suitcases) all over the Rockies. Needing mountain guides to retrieve the cash Lithgow radios for rescue help.When Stallone and Rooker (still on bad terms with each other) answer the call they find themselves pressed into Sherpa service at gunpoint. Meanwhile Turner and fellow pilot Ralph Waite remain at the rescue base unaware of the criminal activity going on.Compelled to one-up the avalanche of trashy action pictures before it ""Cliffhanger"" makes us acutely aware of how mega-mean these villains are. In the films two meanest scenes the uni-named Leon kicks punches and knifes Stallone in every conceivable part of the body only to get his grisly ""just"" reward. Then another Lithgow sidekick (Craig Fairbrass -- the racist policeman in the brilliant PBS drama ""Prime Suspect"") literally plays soccer with Rookers body only to get his comeuppance.In these and many other scenes the human body gets it in every conceivable way. Phlegm and blood fly from kicked mouths in slow motion bodies are skewered by stalactites bullets and jagged knives turn human guts into Hamburger Helper and Lithgow turns on even those closest to him. Love he tells one unfortunate partner before blowing a hole through her middle is all about sacrifice.""Swiss Family Robinson"" this aint.By the way heres Renny Harlin on why he decided to make this picture ""After Die Hard 2 I was looking for another movie that could give me the same kind of thrills yet give me more in terms of character and relationships.""He must be referring to the way supposedly experienced rescue climber Turner squeals like a bimbo in distress when she sees a cave full of bats or constantly gives away her position to the criminals by hollering out to Stallone. Dont look for screenings of ""Cliffhanger"" at future feminist film festivals.Maybe Harlin (who also made ""Nightmare on Elm Street IV"") was referring to the soul-searching grunts and gasps by Stallone as he lugs his body over precarious mountain ledges; or the classic enmity between Stallone and Rooker (not since Iago and Othello . . .). Or possibly Harlins most proud of Lithgows unforgettably fleshed out personality. ""You want to kill me dont you?"" he tells Rooker. ""Take a number and get in line.""
