When the US mens Olympic basketball squad won gold in London earlier this month there was a fair amount of comment about lessons learned at the 04 Athens games when the team never came together and left with bronze. Shades of Sylvester Stallones ""Expendables"" franchise. Sure theres inherent interest in seeing old-school action icons tossed together in the same sandbox but imagine what a blast it could be if the movies gave them genuinely inspired material. As it stands ""The Expendables 2"" is lazily satisfied with repeating the first movies formula shortcomings and grisly strengths alike just as the first movie was content to slavishly ploddingly cover the hits of the 80s. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Directed by genre journeyman Simon West (""Con Air"") the sequel reunites Stallones grizzled mercenary with his bulletproof core crew right hand Jason Statham loose-screw Dolph Lundgren backup muscle Terry Crews and Randy Couture and (briefly) Jet Li. Wunderkind sniper Liam Hemsworth (""The Hunger Games"") and Chinese actress Yu Nan are the groups new recruits. And for those keeping a fanboy scorecard the lineup again includes Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger in slightly expanded roles. Jean-Claude Van Damme plays bad guy with semi-intentional panache. (Its partly just the sunglasses.) And Chuck Norris is the most busily social ""lone wolf"" around. If theres one way the sequel does try harder its in the lots-of-moving-parts department. Slow-moving parts but still. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The initial setup involves CIA man Willis dispatching Stallone and company to Eastern Europe on a safecracking job but when the group is ambushed by Van Damme theyre soon ordering up a combo meal of plutonium recovery and revenge. Along the way (and in a breakneck hostage-extraction opener) theres enough chunky bloodshed and creatively choreographed knife-throwing to equal the first installments grungy thrills. Whats also the same though is the disappointing lack of cleverness. Lundgren is divertingly kooky and Van Damme flashes an annoyed Eurotrashy attitude that could be better leveraged. But more clunky ""Ahll be bahk"" jokes? Please say they wont be even the self-referential ones. Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

Jason Statham and others are along for the ride too. (Lionsgate)By David Hiltbrand Inquirer Staff WriterPosted August 19 2012Its hard to believe there was much clamor for a sequel to Sylvester Stallones 2010 blast-em-up The Expendables. Unless by some unlikely chance it did exceedingly well overseas.But this is no time for logic - Geronimo here we go againStallone and Jason Statham return as the leaders of a weathered motorcycle club who call themselves the Expendables. They also double as a deadly mercenary incursion team.Their specialty taking on well-armed foreign armies. They go into these seeming suicide missions with a giddy gusto wisecracking and whooping while exterminating hundreds of enemy soldiers.Filling out the team are Terry Crews Randy Couture and Dolph Lundgren. Its a little surprising to see Dolphs Gunner character return. In the first film he was an evil crazed traitor Stallone had to put down.Now hes back and redeemed. Maybe that was just a superficial gaping chest wound he had.Simon West has taken over the directors chair from Stallone. Hes somehow managed to amp up the violence a pretty mean feat.The Expendables 2 is a cascade of explosions and blood splatter. Bad guys are decapitated eviscerated and vaporized. The plot is basically the same as in the first film. The guys put down a viciously repressive military junta halfway around the world and then on their second mission things get personal.The bonus in this film is the parade of aging action-film guest stars who join in the festivities. Its like a bath of stale testosterone as these Hollywood tough guys from the 80s swap references to their most famous movie lines. Their individual entrances are the primary pleasure of The Expendables 2 so lets not spoil the fun.Even the villain is a former matinee muscle man. Its Jean-Claude Van Damme. The film makes a fetish of high-ordnance weapons but Stallones Barney Ross still favors the old rock-em-sock-em style. His final bare-knuckle showdown with Van Damme is a furious battle of the body doubles.With this film the Expendables franchise (can I really be saying this?) finds its formula and takes on unavoidable momentum. Nice to know Americas action stars no matter how old they get will never lack for gainful employment.

"Expendables 2 The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; expendables-2-the ) Expendables 2 The (United States 2012) August 17 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Expendables 2 does not defy expectations; it defines them. If you think you know what the movie will deliver youre probably right. No surprises no twists. Even more than the original The Expendables this feels like an homage to the 80s although maybe thats because of higher profile parts for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger whose cameos have been expanded to supporting roles. Joining the party are Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris. And the much feared PG-13 neutering did not happen. The Expendables 2 glories in carnage to a degree where its almost impossible to imagine how much cutting would be needed to avoid an R. On the whole The Expendables 2 is more satisfying than The Expendables. With Stallone no longer behind the camera (he has been replaced by Simon West) the action scenes are better staged and more competently presented (no shaky-cam this time around). Theres more humor than in the first installment although nearly all the good one-liners are given to Schwarzenegger. The action is fast and brutal and if it doesnt raise the pulse much its at least flashy. The plot is a by-the-numbers affair that feels like it was dusted off the shelf as a rejected 80s Bond movie but The Expendables 2 isnt about character development or narrative inventiveness. Its about kicking ass blowing up things and spending time in the comfort of a darkened theater surrounded by 80s action icons. The core members of The Expendables remain the same. The leader is Barney Ross (Stallone) the grizzled veteran of many operations. His right-hand man is Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) and support is provided by Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Toll Road (Randy Couture). Mickey Roarke is nowhere to be seen and Jet Li has only a brief appearance (hes gone by the time we get to the opening credits). But theres new blood Liam Hemsworth plays Billy the Kid and Nan Yus Maggie brings a little estrogen into this flood of testosterone. Of course shes a strong woman - in this context that means she walks softly and carries a big gun. Van Damme gets to play the bad guy (cleverly named Vilain) which guarantees him a big one-on-one with Stallone at the end. Willis is Mr. Church the man who hires The Expendables and Schwarzenegger is Trench a rival who collaborates to pay back a debt. Chuck Norris reprises his role as John Booker from 1978s Good Guys Wear Black. As for the plot... we dont need no stinkin plot. Its something about Vilain finding a stash of weapons-grade plutonium deep in a mine and trying to get it out by using slave labor. He wants to flood the black market with it; five tons of the stuff can make a lot of bombs. The Expendables are all that stand in his way. For Barney its not just about national security its personal - he has a score to settle with Vilain. The whole movie exists as a set-up for the big climax. Not only do we see a Stallone/Van Damme smackdown (which probably would have been more impressive 20 years ago) but were treated to Schwarzenegger and Willis teaming up and trading quips. This provides a couple of priceless moments Willis saying ""This time Ill be back"" (although Arnold gets to utter it first) and Schwarzenegger offering ""Yippe Kayay"" (no ""motherfucker"" included). The final battle is fun but it takes a little too long getting there and the (mercifully brief) ""character building"" moments are almost painful. Not a lot needs to be said or written about The Expendables 2 which does exactly what its supposed to do - no more no less. Since most viewers will go to this movie with a firm understanding of what theyre getting the sequel is unlikely to disappoint. In fact because it offers more than teases with Schwarzenegger and Willis it can be said to be more satisfying. This is basic generic action filmmaking as much a throwback to the 80s as many of the actors who grace the screen. Those with a desire to overdose on testosterone need look no further.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The first Expendables movie benefitted enormously from nostalgia not just for the cast of action icons like Sylvester Stallone but for a time when action meant crude Golan-Globus productions with practical effects big explosions and roided-out machine-gunners getting their testicles electrocuted in the jungles of Southeast Asia. But The Expendables 2 makes a franchise out of a novelty item and the nostalgic kick is gone Its a reminder that most of those 80s actioners were xenophobic and dumb that many of its stars had more muscle mass than charisma and that the sight of these old fossils referring to themselves as old fossils is more pathetic than cheekily self-referential. Theres nothing wrong with the no-frills two-fisted 80s action aesthetic--which is still a relief from contemporary abuse of CGI--but merely reheating it with a wink isnt enough anymore. The needlessly murky plot finds Stallone and his band of mercenaries--Jason Statham Dolph Lundgren Jet Li Terry Crews Randy Couture and newcomers Liam Hemsworth and Yu Nan--dispatched by CIA agent Bruce Willis on a mission to retrieve a MacGuffin. When bad guy Jean-Claude Van Damme (playing a character named ""Vilain"") foils their plans and kills one of Stallones men the gang goes back for revenge and justice. This involves infiltrating some terrible operation where Van Damme and his thugs are enslaving locals and forcing them to dig for plutonium in an Eastern European hellpit. Such things make Stallone stare off to some vague point in the horizon and mumble something righteous before corralling his crew into slaughtering henchmen indiscriminately. The 72-year-old Chuck Norris makes a ceremonial appearance as a ""lone wolf"" who leaves many bodies in his wake without seeming capable of raising his arms above his head. (Though killing without having to move does suit the Chuck Norris Facts meme.) Hes the symbol for much of whats wrong with The Expendables 2 Trotting out old stars spouting old catchphrases against a generic action backdrop isnt exactly giving the genre a shot in the arm. The Expendables was a fine enough curtain call for Stallone and friends a chance to relive past glories and rebel against the status quo. But if he wants to be a star again hell need to do more than keep taking a bow.

Photo Credit Lionsgate advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Barney Ross and his mercenaries seek revenge for one of their own. RATING R (graphic violence language) BOTTOM LINE Another mocking salute to dumb action flicks but the jokes on you It really is dumb. CAST Sylvester Stallone Jean-Claude Van Damme Chuck Norris Yu Nan. LENGTH 143 Yeah yeah I get it ""The Expendables 2"" is a fun-loving throwback to the gloriously bad action films of the 1980s. Heres what I dont get Why couldnt it be a throwback to the good ones? The 2010 original starring Sylvester Stallone and other square-jaws from the Reagan era had potential to reinvigorate the long-gone ""hard action"" genre. But Stallone who wrote and directed went for easy self-parody -- bombs bullets bad guys exploding like watermelons -- instead of genuine excitement. His strategy was to mock the movie before his audience could. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Likewise the main joke of ""The Expendables 2"" is how lame it dares to be. Stallone returns as mercenary Barney Ross along with Jason Statham Terry Crews Dolph Lundgren and Randy Couture as his lazily-sketched helpmates. Jet Li drops out early replaced by Yu Nan as Maggie (a girl) and Liam Hemsworth plays eager newcomer Billy ""The Kid."" While trying to swipe the blueprints for a Russian nuclear cache -- talk about the 80s -- one of the Expendables is killed prompting a new mission revenge. Director Simon West (""Con Air"") gives the movie a jokey sloppy straight-to-video feel but hes not the only one. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis are back with bigger roles and more one-liners about their better movies; the famously wooden Chuck Norris in his franchise debut as Booker seems to have petrified with age. The only player with his heart in the game is Jean-Claude Van Damme relishing his role as a European villain named -- get this -- Vilain. There is some nasty business at odds with the lighthearted vibe Maggie is an expert torturer and butcher which seems a little unsavory. But ""The Expendables 2"" is generally a carbon copy of the first film mildly amusing but deeply unsatisfying.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 17 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 17 2012 924AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Simon West Written by Sylvester Stallone and Richard Wenk Starring Starring Sylvester Stallone Jason Statham Yu Nan Classification 14A Country USA Language English The Expendables 2 like the unnumbered original not only recycles a cadre of once-iconic coots - Arnie S. Sly Stallone Bruce Willis among them - but kindly reissues an invitation to play that most entertaining and competitive of Hollywood sports Whos got the best facelift? The slickest dye job? The buffest Botox? Watch The Expendables 2 official trailer video Video Stars cast their votes for future Expendables Along the way said coots augmented by Chuck Norris along with relative youngsters like Jason Statham defy their years with some vintage butt-kicking all shot without recourse to any newfangled CGI.Of course the result is forgettable but at least its efficiently and breezily forgettable. Whats more there are laughs too and heres the best part - one or two of them are actually intentional.First frame Nepal. Olive-skinned baddies are torturing hooded figure. Coots to the rescue. Stuff blows up. Rescue effected hood lifted escape made - on armoured trucks slicing through the jungle on speed boats skimming over water on an aged plane propelling through the air. Being a coot myself Im exhausted. Then the opening credits roll.So its back to the U.S. of A. in a bar for a bit of banter until Willis pops up to give the coots their next assignment. Theyre joined by Maggie (Yu Nan) cause shes ""combat proficient"" and pretty not to mention half anyone elses age. Oddly undeterred by that chronological chasm Maggie bats her eyes at Sly who pretends not to notice (or is too myopic to see but lets give him the benefit of the doubt). Then they all head off to Albania to meet Jean-Claude Van Dammes ultra-cool villain a badass in dark glasses.Villain gets down to homicidal biz by killing a raw innocent which for reasons unknown prompts Sly to wax philosophic on the fate of once-iconic coots in our fickle culture ""Why is it the ones who deserve to die keep on living? Whats the message in that?"" Oops sorry maybe he was talking about the villain. Anyway in a deep mine left over from the Cold War theres a vast stash of ""weapons-grade plutonium"" to be protected from nefarious hands. Alas that blabbermouth Sly is at it again ""We keep it light until its time to get dark and then we get pitch black."" Talk about your spoiler alerts - so much for the rest of the plot.To his credit director Simon West (in a rare concession to Father Time Stallone has eschewed double-duty behind the camera in this outing) negotiates the transitions from light to pitch black with competence if not flair. And you gotta love it when Chuck shows his lifted face. Bystander ""I hear you got bitten by a king cobra."" Chuck ""Yes but after five days of agonizing pain the cobra died."" In fact all the coots seem comfortable in their surgically tightened skin - to a grizzled man theyre savvy screen veterans and surprisingly non-pathetic. And no one can deny that the golden oldies score harmonizes perfectly with the golden oldies.The exception Im sad to report is Arnie who seems pale and distracted no doubt still pining for the bloodier action of politics perhaps looking out at that Romney fellow and thinking ""There but for a birth certificate go I.""

Its hard not to like a movie in which Bruce Willis toupee-less CIA agent accuses Stallones ragtag band of mercenaries of engaging in ""male pattern badness. Willis actually picks up a weapon or two this time around and hilariously shares a tiny mini-car with Arnold Schwarzenegger who fires off a nonstop series of ""Terminator-themed quips when he isnt plowing tractors through mountainsides. This time Willis has sent the Expendables to Albania -- or is it China represented by Bulgarian locations? -- to rescue some ""weapons-grade plutonium that has gone astray. Along the way our heroes also free some enslaved natives and wreak vengeance on a sadistic baddie (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who limits Liam Hemsworths participation as the teams nod to youth to the films first half hour. (Hemsworths in the film roughly twice as long as Jet Li who literally bails after a 15-minute all-action prologue set in Nepal.) The fallen young comrade also lends some unintended poignancy when Stallone (who recently lost a son in real life) delivers a eulogy ""Why is it the ones who deserve to live the ones that want to live the most die and the ones that dont deserve to live keep on going?"" Vigorously directed by Simon West (""Con Air) ""The Expendables 2 otherwise eschews such philosophizing in favor of male camaraderie and explosions. Lest you get the wrong idea there are the odd half-hearted passes made at the groups token female member played by lovely Chinese martial artist Nan Yu. The script credited to Stallone and Richard Wenk allows Stallone and Jason Statham to trade lots of mock insults while laying bloody waste to an army of bad guys. But it relegates other returning cast members Dolph Lundgren Terry Crews Randy Couture and Scott Adkins primarily to interchangeable comic relief. They dont get anywhere near the laughs of newcomer Chuck Norris whose hilarious extended cameo begins on a backlot version of New York City that the script insists is an abandoned Soviet training base. An anticlimactic hand-to-hand battle between Stallone and Van Damme had me worrying about their Medicare coverage. Fortunately the film goes out with a rousing airport battle that cheerfully flouts logic and the laws of physics while allowing Norris Schwarzenegger and Willis to join in the fun.

"The Expendables 2 is a kick Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview The Expendables 2 is a kickThe Expendables 2 is armed with Sylvester Stallone Jason Statham Liam Hemsworth Bruce Willis Jet Li and more for blow-em-up craziness thats B-movie fun.August 16 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Sylvester Stallone with his family at the London premiere of ""The... (Sang Tan / Associated Press )""The Expendables 2""arrives jam-packed and fully loaded with main man Sly Stallone still leading the charge followed by that wild bunch of aging brawn. There is some new blood in Liam Hemsworth and a lot of very old blood with nearly every AARP action hero in the book turning up at some point. And the kill count reaches into the ca-zillions.But somehow all that testosterone-infused blow--em-up craziness turns out to be kind of a kick.Director Simon West hasnt messed much with the basic formula of Barneys (Stallone) buffed-up band of misfits saving the day though the camp factor has been ratcheted up considerably and the action is even more over the top than in its 2010 predecessor. The central wrecking crew is composed of Christmas (Jason Statham) Yin Yang (Jet Li) Gunner (Dolph Lundgren) Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Toll Road (Randy Couture). The fight has shifted from Latin America to Asia but freedom is once again on the line. The guy responsible for this desert storm is brutally played by kickboxing great Jean-Claude Van Damme a a villain named Vilain (sic).Like the original ""Expendables 2"" starts with a brazen bid to rescue someone from imminent torture and death this time in Nepal. Since Barney and the guys dont really do anything on the down-low it is a breathless stretch of crash and burn that stacks up the dead while destroying around a hundred sets and the souped-up vintage plane Barney flies his troops around in.But thats just the tease and a good spot to start throwing in some of those cameos a Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) Church (Bruce Willis) and Booker (Chuck Norris) who always manage to be memorable. Its also where we meet new recruit Billy the Kid (Hemsworth). Hes just past a nasty stint fighting in Afghanistan with a sad story hell soon be telling. But before Barney Billy and the rest even have a chance to get out of Nepal Mr. Church (Willis as dry as a martini and worth savoring) comes calling with their next dangerous assignment in nearby China.But what bugs Barney is that hes forced to bring along gasp a woman. Maggie (Yu Nan) is some kind of computer genius and since the guys arent very smart shes critical. Theres a secret cache of Russian plutonium long buried in a mine that Vilain wants to get his hands on. In the process villagers will be conscripted or killed or both.Barney and the boys will stage a series of raids to right all the wrongs. And Booker (Norris) will show up armed and dangerous also presenting the chance for some lone wolf jokes. (For the uninitiated 1983s ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" starred Norris and is one of the many many nods to action movie lore that are sandwiched into the film.)There are a series of good moves that make ""2"" slightly better than ""1"" starting with Stallones decision to turn over directing duties to West an old hand at the genre with ""Con Air"" and ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" among his credits. Richard Wenk came aboard to co-write the sequel with Stallone and the result is a cleverer script. Cinematographer Shelly Johnson gives it all a vintage postcard look.For all the tough guy posturing in ""Expendables 2"" they actually turn out to be a bunch of old softies a who knew? When they arent discussing ways to crush their adversaries youre likely to find them talking about their feelings. Hemsworth is a nice addition as the good kid who manages to pull off his Army sob story without totally embarrassing the guys though there were a few wet eyes on screen.As to the boom boom those sequences are splashy and high-octane enough they should satisfy the adrenaline junkies. But what gives ""Expendables 2"" its charm is the films unabashed nostalgia for the genres best B-movie moments. As Stathams character puts it so well while slipping on a pair of brass knuckles never count out the classics.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESExpendables 2 to pound ParaNorman Sparkle Timothy...August 16 2012Movie review The ExpendablesAugust 13 2010Sylvester Stallone springs back into actionJuly 18 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-the-expendables-2-20120817,0,7593892.story",200,theexpendables27,theexpendables2,latimes

And this time the fearless crew of mercenaries is more fun to be around.By Frank Masi Lionsgate-Millennium FilmsThe Expendables 2 featuring returning performances by Sylvester Stallone left Jason Statham and Terry Crews is more entertainingly cartoonish than the original.EnlargeCloseBy Frank Masi Lionsgate-Millennium FilmsThe Expendables 2 featuring returning performances by Sylvester Stallone left Jason Statham and Terry Crews is more entertainingly cartoonish than the original.Sponsored LinksThe gore is ridiculously graphic and theres far more brawling than brains in The Expendables 2 (  1/2 out of four rated R opens Friday nationwide) but the one-liners delivered in a melange of accents fly almost as furiously as the deafening explosions and whizzing bullets.Where the first Expendables directed by Sylvester Stallone took itself too seriously the sequel directed by Simon West is more entertainingly cartoonish.MORE Mature heroes in action despite the creaksThe corps weapons cover a wide swath from brass knuckles to army tanks to airplane propellers that double as decapitation instruments all in service of a stupendously high body count. Be prepared for an especially loud sonic assault but some of the one-liners are priceless as written by Stallone and Richard Wenk.Stallone and his coterie of aging action stars send-up their he-man images in this celebration of mindless machismo. Broadly amusing gags ensue.The story opens with an extended 15-minute siege. The group is attacking legions of soldiers in a Nepalese village in order to rescue Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Later one of their own is cruelly murdered and the hired guns go into high-octane revenge mode.About the movieThe Expendables 21/2 out of fourStars Sylvester Stallone Jason Statham Arnold Schwarzenegger Jean-Claude Van Damme Chuck Norris Terry Crews Liam Hemsworth Dolph Lundgren Director Simon WestDistributor Lionsgate Rating R for strong language and bloody violence throughout Running time 1 hour 43 minutes Opens Friday nationwideThe camaraderie is a bit less testosterone-laden this time with the addition of codebreaker Maggie (Nan Yu) to the gang. Shes there per the orders of CIA agent Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) to whom Barney (Stallone) owes a debt. Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a baddie with the un-subtle moniker Jean Vilain. Chuck Norris is a one-man army.But the plot is incidental. Expendables 2 is all about carnage and cheekiness.Some of the visuals leave indelible impressions such as a world-famous action star hilariously ripping off the door of a Smart car ala Herman Munster. (To keep from spoiling the fun we wont say whodunit.)Enjoy three clips from Expendables 2These movies are not meant to be anything more than silly fun with an all-star cast of mature hunks engaging in shameless action flick cliches and capitalizing on audience nostalgia. Fans of Stallone Schwarzenegger Willis Norris and Van Damme will have a field day watching these movie icons flex their still-taut muscles. Younger more current action hunks like Jason Statham Liam Hemsworth and Jet Li mix it up with the veterans.Time spent as governor of California did nothing to improve Schwarzeneggers line readings. Between Belgian Van Dammes thick accent (he pronounces challenge with the accent firmly on the second syllable) and Schwarzeneggers Teutonic growl some lines are mangled as hideously as bad guys bodies. Fortunately language is beside the point in this bombastic shoot-em-up extravaganza.The Expendables 2 is corny barbaric and sometimes visually murky. But humor and self-deprecating macho charm make this male pattern badness crowd-pleasing fun. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Even when theyre ambulatory these gents have the limited flexibility of posable figures who are worth more as collectibles untouched in unopened packaging. And two years after Stallone first gathered a core cadre of fellow rusting iron men in The Expendables I couldnt be happier to see them oiling their gun barrels grunting their one-liners and blowing away bad guys who speak English with suspicious accents. Not for a minute does this lot suggest that theres any post 9/11-ish global-warming-ish economic-meltdown-ish subtext to their stupidly impressive antics. What a fun-dumb relief In the isolationist Expendables world all foreigners are bad news. All buddy bonding is done with a wink. All pretenses of art are checked at the door. Someone even says ""Ill be back."" (Guess who?) And the beauty is this testosteronic movie is perfectly exportable all around the globe. Dub the whole thing in Tagalog or Urdu skip the subtitles and it would still be universally understandable. Rocky Terminator John McClane USA USA Stallone himself directed The Expendables with a meaty hand and slapdash control. The Expendables 2 benefits from the meaner leaner moves of Simon West a dab hand at brute-force eyeball-gouging action pix (hes got Con Air and Lara Croft Tomb Raider on his resume). The picture opens with a great/ludicrous action prologue an insane rescue mission set in a hostile ""Nepal"" thats little more than a generic Asian hellhole full of sadistic maniacs. But the bullet-riddled heart of the story concerns simple simpleton brute force revenge as the team seeks payback for the death of one of their own killed on the orders of Jean-Claude van Damme as Euro-evil incarnate. Theres also the matter of retrieving stolen computer gadgetry that just might blow up the world. The fellas eat their grub strap on their weapons and lumber into combat. For the first time the dudes are joined by a kick-ass Chinese lady Expendablette played by Yu Nan who throws a sultry glower or two at team leader Barney Ross (Stallone) before joining the fray. Assigning artistic values like ""good"" or ""bad"" to The Expendables 2 is a fools assignment. The movie is excellent crap fine junk an exercise in campy movie nostalgia and a demonstration of American supremacy in the field of nutty cosmetic enhancements for aging movie stars. I had an inexcusably fine time studying movie-star hairlines and admiring their willingness to let us gawk. B Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Credit Frank Masi/Lionsgate Just when you think the action-hero-filled ""Expendables 2"" has forgotten that this is at heart a comedy franchise along comes a guy who has been out of the game for years to save the day.That familiar weathered face belongs to Chuck Norris and whatever Sylvester Stallone the architect of these films paid him to return to the big screen it wasnt enough. Mr. Norris arrives just as the blood baths and leaden dialogue are beginning to grow tedious and his deadpan self-parody is pretty darn funny. More important it gives you permission to laugh at the rest of this mindless movie which is the only way to choke it down.As with the first ""Expendables"" in 2010 Mr. Stallone has assembled a roster of prominent action stars many of them noticeably past their prime and a preposterous amount of explosives and heavy weaponry to enact a formulaic good-triumphs tale. Returning cast members include Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger who have a bit more to do here than they did in the first film as well as Jason Statham Dolph Lundgren Randy Couture Jet Li and Terry Crews. Newcomers in addition to Mr. Norris include Yu Nan (yes women can be Expendables too) Liam Hemsworth of ""The Hunger Games"" and playing a villain named Vilain Jean-Claude Van Damme.Mr. Stallones character Barney leads a group of old-school mercenaries who are dispatched by the mysterious Church (Mr. Willis) to retrieve something from a safe in the wreckage of a crashed plane. Vilain is there too one of the Expendables dies and the mission morphs into one involving payback and plutonium.Mr. Stallone directed the first film but here turned that job over to Simon West ""so that he could focus more on the writing"" the films press notes explain. (He shares a screenwriting credit with Richard Wenk.) That extra attention to the script produced plenty of those earnest Stallone-esque lines that you can only hope are intended humorously because if theyre not theyre just embarrassing.Until Mr. Norris shows up the scripts efforts at sly comedy dont work all that well relying on obvious inside jokes and references to the various stars previous work. Mr. Norriss character Booker (also the name of his character in the 1978 film ""Good Guys Wear Black"") works those same angles but is somehow much funnier. From his arrival until the film works its way to the inevitable mega-confrontation in which the bad guys shoot with stunning inaccuracy and the good guys dont the movie is pleasantly dumb fun if you watch it with the right mind-set.

Its the joints that are a little creaky but what would you expect from this sequel to the 2010 blockbuster in which a cadre of aged action stars led by Sylvester Stallone gathered to fire guns blow things up and beat the living daylights out of assorted baddies?

Credit Lionsgate Films From The Expendables 2 - Ive Got Shoes Bigger Than This Ive Got Shoes Bigger Than This Credit Lionsgate Films From The Expendables 2 - Incoming Chopper Incoming Chopper Credit Lionsgate Films The Expendables 2 brings back essentially the same cast with a few additions and features approximately the same quota of explosions and ass-kicking as its predecessor did give or take a few incidents of flame-throwing and skull-bashing. Stallone returns as mumbling mercenary Barney Ross who leads a band of musclebound merry men wholl do anything for a buck Barney is most commonly found in the company of his sardonic sidekick Lee Christmas (Jason Statham who somehow emerges from the most ridiculous scenarios with his coolness intact). Milling around in the background with not much to do except throw their weight around are Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews). Jet Lis Yin Yang -- one of the most appealing characters in the first movie -- appears in an early scene and is quickly dispensed with. Hes replaced sort of by an Asian operative named Maggie (Yu Nan) who seems to exist solely to make moo-moo eyes at rugged he-man Ross whos having none of that girly stuff. Theres also a greenhorn named Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) but lets not get ahead of ourselves. Most of the action takes place in Bulgaria where Ross and Co. have been dispatched by shadowy CIA go-between Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) to prevent a heap of weapons-grade plutonium from falling into the wrong hands. This requires crash-landing a plane that was pretty rickety to begin with blowing assorted evildoers to kingdom come and making the acquaintance of a village full of women whose menfolk have been enslaved and put to work in that plutonium mine. Director Simon West (The Mechanic Con Air) guides the plot about as well as he needs to given that the body count is what really matters here. i Jean-Claude Van Damme plays the aptly named Jean Vilain -- hes the bad guy see? -- in the sequel to 2010s blockbuster hit.

Frank Masi/Lionsgate Films And boy do those bodies pile up. The Expendables 2 is reasonably cathartic in a fall-down-go-boom way and if the pictures self-conscious riffing becomes tiresome after a while -- there are only so many jokes a bunch of middle-aged sides o beef can make at their own expense -- its still much wittier than its predecessor. The dialogue broken down and remixed works as a kind of brutalist comic-book haiku ""Better duck"" ""Oh [expletive]"" ""I got this"" ""Fire"" ""Yeah"" ""Whoa"" And how can you resist Jean-Claude Van Damme as a villain named -- what else? -- Vilain showing off the star-shaped tattoo on his neck and explaining helpfully that it is the ""sign of the goat -- the pet of Satan"" The Expendables 2 stands strong against Satan his goats and everything they represent. In its worldview truth justice and Doans Pills are really all that matter.

Entertainment One/Everett Collection By John Anderson Updated Aug. 16 2012 636 p.m. ET At the Museum of Modern Art in New York right now theres a smallish gallery upstairs set up to provide a crash course in Abstract Expressionism. It might also serve as a DVD extra to director David Cronenbergs elliptical new feature ""Cosmopolis."" At each end are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock artists directly referenced in the film. Between them are paintings with an emotional kinship to Mr. Cronenbergs coolly absurdist and disturbing drama a stark staring woman by de Kooning and a violently kinetic Clyfford Still in which a jagged shriek of color rips across a funereal black backdrop. Riding across Manhattan in a stretch limo in order to get a haircut the day of 28-year-old billionaire asset manager Eric Packer devolves into an odyssey with a cast of characters that start to tear his world apart. (Video Entertainment One) ""Cosmopolis"" from the novel by Don DeLillo is not about art per se. But it uses art as a counterweight to money and to a fundamentalist belief in financial ""systems"" that has led its ""hero"" down a path to destruction. Like the novel Mr. Cronenbergs screen adaptation is keyed to the off-kilter economics of a present-day Manhattan even if the story is set a few moments in the future. In addition it marks Mr. Cronenbergs return following three very successful and accessible entertainments--""A History of Violence"" ""Eastern Promises"" and ""A Dangerous Method""--to a more characteristic weirdness. Conventional it is not. Engrossing it is. ""Twilight"" heartthrob Robert Pattinson portrays the insufferable Eric Packer a ridiculously wealthy young trader who has gambled heavily on the yuan and is about to lose his Brunello Cucinelli shirt. Swaddled in his custom-elongated limousine (which has also been lined with cork a la Prousts bedroom) Eric decides he needs a haircut; the only acceptable barber is on the other side of the city. The president is in town. ""Just to be clear"" Eric asks his security man (Kevin Durand) ""which president are we talking about?"" As his vehicle proceeds to make its excruciating way from east to west a simple trip across town becomes a Joseph Campbell-evoking mytho-heroic vision quest in which the protagonists life will be reviewed and found wanting and a luxury limo will morph into a metaphorical hearse. Along the way the New York painters of the 40s are referenced in ways that are pointed and even a bit self-serving My film Mr. Cronenberg is saying will provoke much of the same general bewilderment that greeted Pollock (a very Pollocklike creation is ""dripped"" behind the opening credits). Nevertheless great art is great art. And money--the underlying evil of the film--is just money. The Canadian director no doubt hopes to make some money although like Rothko his primary motivation seems to be existential dread rather than a new swimming pool in Toronto. Otherwise he would make conventional movies. WSJ contributor John Anderson reviews ""Cosmopolis"" a movie directed by David Cronenberg telling the story of a 28-year-old billionaire asset manager whose life gets torn apart by a cast of characters as he rides through Manhattan in a stretch limo looking to get a haircut. (Video Entertainment One) Those kinds of movies have likable heroes and no one is supposed to like Eric Packer. Not his icy wife (Sarah Gordon) an heiress and bad poet who refuses to have sex with him. Not the various subordinates who pass through the womblike limo itself an exercise in expressionism (it seems to shape-shift but that may be the angles). Its hard to warm to the guy After he has backseat sex with his art dealer Didi Fancher (a mischievous Juliette Binoche) she tells him about a Rothko thats suddenly become available. Didi recommends a buy. Eric decides instead that he wants to purchase the entire Rothko Chapel in Houston. ""It belongs to the world"" Didi protests. ""Its mine if I buy it"" Eric replies at which point the rear window of the limo suddenly becomes awash in daylight. Either that or the wrath of God. ""Cosmopolis"" is a bumper-to-bumper road movie. There are moments of very abrupt violence and much thats going to push conventionally minded audiences away. Mr. Pattinson who no doubt wants to escape the ghoulish goldmine that has made him a star isnt quite in step with the films agenda Hes a bit too likable as well as constricted although those qualities are used by Mr. Cronenberg to the films advantage. The director whose films have often been pigeonholed as ""horror"" has never been interested in monsters even if Eric Packer is one. Like many sci-fi visionaries he has watched where the culture was going and pursued its logical ends including virtual realities and body modification (notably in ""eXistenZ""). ""Cosmopolis"" with its echoes of Beckett and Sisyphus carries a rather banal message--that absolute wealth corrupts absolutely. But its not pushing any Occupy bandwagon despite the surreal street scenes Mr. Cronenberg provides of rioting the adoption of the rat as a unit of currency and the attack on Packer by a prankster ""pastry assassin"" played by Mathieu Amalric (""I am the action painter of the cream pie""). Mr. DeLillo wrote the book in 2003 which is when producer Paulo Branco brought it to Mr. Cronenberg. In marketing terms its arrival today is just good timing--something that for Eric Packer has just about run out. WSJ contributor John Anderson reviews ""The Awakening"" a movie directed by Nick Murphy that tells the story of an author who attempts to debunk a haunting at a prestigious London boarding school. (Video Sony Pictures) ENLARGE Rebecca Hall in The Awakening Origin Pictures; The Awakening The centenary of World War I is virtually around the corner and the closer it gets the more the war will invade pop culture. Foreshadowing what is sure to be anniversary-mania two summers from now is ""The Awakening"" a supernatural thriller set in the immediate aftermath of that war--""a time for ghosts"" as an opening title warns. The film benefits enormously from having the luminous Rebecca Hall as its lead. It also gains an ominous gravity from the haunted wounded and wobbly England in which its set. Hoax exposer Florence Cathcart (Rebecca Hall) visits a boarding school to explain sightings of a child ghost. Everything she believes unravels as the missing begin to show themselves. (Video Cohen Media Group) There a professional nonbeliever named Florence Cathcart (Ms. Hall) spends her time debunking the so-called mediums who have sprung up like toadstools to exploit the grief-stricken. Leading her anti-spiritualist vice squad Florence breaks up a phony seance getting a slap in the face for her trouble. ""Did you ever have a child?"" the slapper demands clearly preferring belief to the truth. But what is the truth? When Florence is hired by a boys school to explain the ghost sightings that have paralyzed the student body reality becomes enshrouded in mist. Having set up Florence and his audience as cynics director Nick Murphy sets the bar rather high for the kind of eeriness to follow. But both he and his cast are up to the challenge. Whether ""The Awakening"" holds together logically or lives up to the standards it sets for itself is a question but the atmosphere is seductive. The performances by Imelda Staunton as a Mrs. Danvers-esque caretaker and Dominic West as a teacher and war vet with survivor guilt are very fine. The star however is Ms. Hall whose plucky Florence displays doubt intelligence dignity and tolerance mixed with just a whiff of condescension for those who salve their mourning hearts with the balm of blind belief. So much virtue might have been trite. Here its enchanting. Watch a clip form the film The Expendables 2 starring Sylvester Stallone (Video; Lionsgate) ENLARGE Some of the cast of The Expendables 2 Lionsgate The Expendables 2 ""This is embarrassing"" says Arnold Schwarzenegger. ""Sure is"" grunts Sylvester Stallone. Theyre not really talking about the lumbering vehicle theyve found themselves aboard but as with much of ""The Expendables 2"" the jokes are there to be mined. The movies chief gag is that all these dinosaurs are in the same place at the same time in an old-timers game of 80s action heroes who include Mr. Stallone Mr. Schwarzenegger Bruce Willis Dolph Lundgren Chuck Norris and a villainous Jean-Claude Van Damme who treat their legacies with undignified disdain. Also in the cast are the younger Jason Statham Jet Li and Terry Crews as well as the boyish Liam Helmsworth whose might as well have ""marked for death"" tattooed on his forehead hes so nice and polite. Cut on the old ""Seven Samurai"" template ""E2"" features a group of mercenaries each of whom has a specialty by which he extinguishes enemies with decapitations and arterial explosions. Much of the movies action was very obviously enhanced during the films post-production process to achieve maximum arc and volume--which is excuse the term overkill. It may be a bit late in the game to bemoan the kind of hyper-violence that makes up so much of ""The Expendables 2"" given that its cast has been practicing movie mayhem lo these many years. But does it all have to be so tedious? To the movies credit many of the inside jokes are pretty funny and Mr. Lundgren is close to hilarious as a dissipated Swede named Gunner. But as Joe Morgenstern likes to note this movie--like so many--is barely for Americans at all. Its mostly for those vast overseas audiences who eat this stuff up made global stars of Mr. Stallone and Mr. Schwarzenegger in the first place and helped turn grunting into the Esperanto of the action movie. Fewer words fewer subtitles. Its always been about economics. WSJ contributor John Anderson reviews ""Side by Side"" a documentary directed by Christopher Kenneally in which actor Keanu Reeves sits down with famous hollywood directors like James Cameron David Lynch and Martin Scorsese to discuss the past and future of filmmaking. (Video Tribeca Film) The documentary Side by Side investigates the history process and workflow of both digital and photochemical film creation. Featuring James Cameron Martin Scorsese George Lucas David Lynch Steven Soderbergh and more. (Video Tribeca Film) Side by Side That what we call ""film"" often isnt film anymore may be of interest only to a small percentage of cinema-goers. But those with a serious interest in the future of the form will be well-served by ""Side by Side"" a knowing look at the transition from celluloid to digital capture development and projection. Hosted with depth and charm by one of its producers Keanu Reeves this Christopher Keneally-directed documentary includes interviews with many of the most prominent directors of our time who fall on either side of the argument the digital champions (James Cameron predictably) and those not-quite-Luddites who dont think digital has achieved the texture or artistic qualities of film. The latter include ""Dark Knight Rises"" director Christopher Nolan. ""No one has said it actually looks better"" Mr. Nolan says of the medium thats taking over the medium. All agree that the outcome is inevitable including Martin Scorsese David Lynch and David Fincher. The situation is fascinating and given an illuminating investigation here. ENLARGE DVD Focus Dead Man (1995) Its director Jim Jarmusch called it a ""psychedelic western""; critics called it one of the finer films of 1995 a droll cerebral postmodern hipster social-critique masked as a frontier adventure in which an accountant named William Blake (Johnny Depp)--fatally wounded by a prostitutes jealous ex-boyfriend (Gabriel Byrne)--takes a long walk to his own demise. Shot in glorious black-and-white by the celebrated Robby Muller ""Dead Man"" features the Native-American actor Gary Farmer as the mystical Nobody and a guitar-saturated score by Neil Young who apparently improvised the soundtrack while watching footage of the film. D.O.A. (1950) Film noir was defined by the darkness of its plots and few were darker than this unnerving effort by director Rudolph Mate about a man searching for his own murderer. Frank Bigelow--played by Edmund OBrien at his most palatable--has been poisoned with a ""luminous toxin"" and is given a week to live. He spends the time trying to find out who killed him at one point going to the police to file a report (Cop ""Who was murdered?"" Bigelow ""I was."") The frenzied pace and the role of a lifetime for journeyman OBrien made this a minor classic of the genre. The Grey (2011) Something of a surprise hit for director Joe (""Smokin Aces"") Carnahan this adventure in the far north stars Liam Neeson as the stoic and lethal John Ottway a man who is severely depressed over the woman hes lost and works as a sharp-shooting wolf exterminator at a gas refinery in northernmost Alaska. When their plane goes down in uncharted territory Ottway and his fellow roughnecks make an arduous trek across wolf-infested snow pack a journey that develops into Ottways own spiritual odyssey. A thrilling film one thats far more profound than the advertisements might have let on.

Really. Old guard action stars Sylvester Stallone Dolph Lundgren Jet Li Jean-Claude Van Damme Bruce Willis Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger out to prove they can still cut the mustard. Whats not to root for? But the strain shows in The Expendables 2 even with flashy editing and a pounding soundtrack. Like the 2010 original The Expendables 2 is all sound and fury signifying nothing when at the very least it should add up to big dumb fun. This sequel doesnt wear down your resistance; it just wears you out. It helps (a little) that Simon West of that immortal guilty pleasure Con Air takes over the directing chores from Stallone. But the script by Stallone and Richard Wenk doesnt so much defy credulity as bludgeon it to death. Its up to Stallones Barney Ross and his AARP team to save the world by grabbing hold of a stash of plutonium from a plane that crashed in Albania before the villain (Van Damme) gets it first. Simple stuff. Barneys second-in-command Lee Christmas (Jason Statham a baby at 44) is back in play. And theres new blood in the form of Liam Hemsworth as a sniper trained in Afghanistan and Yu Nam as a Chinese tech genius who is - OMFG - a woman. Their contractor Mr. Trench (Willis) insists on it. And their friendly rival Trench (Schwarzenegger) is amused by it. Cue the hail of bullets. ""Rest in pieces"" cries Barney before blowing away a fool. The script tries to beat audiences and critics to the punch by supplying its own insults. Spotting an aircraft on its last leg Stallone says ""that plane belongs in a museum."" Snaps Schwarzenegger ""we all do."" Ouch. The truth hurts.

Area theaters. In the first few minutes of ""The Expendables 2"" there are just as many ""Uggh"" and ""Hooah"" grunts as there are explosions. Which translates as A lot. Consider it a sign of how heavy the lift was this time for writer-star Sylvester Stallone and his crew. It also may be the war cry of this semi-successful sequel whose cast has as many laugh lines on their faces as battle scars. When Stallone gathered up a mini-platoon of action stars for the first ""Expendables"" two years ago -- along with relative young uns like Jason Statham and Jet Li -- it had a self-deprecating kick. ""2"" works harder to land punches but when it does it provides the kind of fun its fan base hopes for. But expectations and targets are lower all around. Stallones Barney Ross is still the steely but kindhearted leader of mercenaries now seeking vengeance after their youngest member (Liam Hemsworth awkwardly emoting in a no-emote zone) is killed. The villain is a baddie named Vilain (pronounced Vil-ANE) played by Jean-Claude Van Damme as best he can with a face more taut than his pecs. The ""Muscles From Brussels"" and Chuck Norris (as a lone wolf mercenary) are the new oldsters. Besides Statham and Li Barneys team again includes Dolph Lundgren and as the Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop of the group Randy Couture and Terry Crews. Theres also a female assassin (Yu Nan) whose presence is an off note. Would the Delta Force have invited a lady along? Stallone is once more an amiable host. He even pulls off heroics despite having an ill-advised stache laying over his mouth which nowadays looks like a squished octopus. Sadly Lundgren thinks hes comic relief which is tough since we cant understand him while Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger have more to do than in Part One. Both are happy to send up their image though the ex-governator has amazingly lost whatever basic acting skills he once possessed. Still its all exactly as youd expect if less exciting than youd want. Setting a bullet-spraying finale in an abandoned Cold War training ground that resembles 1980s New York after an H-bomb is a nice touch. You get the feeling that had that really happened Stallone and his weathered boys might have withstood the blast bad quips and all.

For starters its an awful pun (and I say this as something of an expert). Either screenwriter Richard Wenk or co-writer/star Sylvester Stallone thought it was genuinely clever or merely clever-sounding enough to include. Its a nonsensical phrase that nonetheless reflects the pattern of this sequel -- each of the many manly men onscreen acts bad with a gun and even worse once armed with dialogue. With that said this ultra-violent follow-up (directed by Simon West of ""Con Air"" fame) gives the audience what it wants in full force which is more than could be said for Stallones original assembly of countless action icons like himself. This time the ranks of the mercenaries known as the Expendables (which still include Jason Statham Jet Li Terry Crews Randy Couture and Dolph Lundgren) have lost morose Mickey Rourke while gaining Liam Hemsworths sniper kid and Nan Yus intelligence operative. Shes been added to the team at the insistence of CIA Agent Church (Bruce Willis sharing more screen time alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger) who wants Barney (Stallone) and his men to retrieve a cryptic doodad from deep in the heart of Eastern Europe. As it turns out they arent the only ones who want this device; Jean Vilain (villainous Jean-Claude Van Damme naturally) wants it for himself and doesnt hesitate to kill the least essential member of the Expendables to do it. What follows is a revenge mission that incorporates a generic plutonium-minded plot and curiously mimics the village rescue of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" only with the added cornball sentimentality of a classic WWII drama and interracial innuendo galore. From the opening assault on a Nepalese village onward West proves to be a slightly steadier hand at the action than Stallone was with less egregious digital blood splatter replaced by a generally gung-ho spirit that occasionally slips into the utterly incomprehensible. (The less said of constantly grainy close-ups and back-home speeches the better.) As the token female addition to the team Yu is suitably awful at dialogue exchanges leaving one to wonder if the more effortlessly charming Michelle Yeoh Maggie Q Zhang Ziyi or Lucy Liu had to pass before she got the part. To be fair shes no more mumble-mouthed than the leads. Its tempting to say that out of the entire cast Lundgren makes the most egregious transformation between films from pouty turncoat into comic relief (mocking his own real-life experience as a Fulbright Scholar for example) but here everyone serves as the comic relief. For better and worse hardly a moment goes by without someone making a winking reference to their own former glory (especially Schwarzenegger). Its the kind of movie where Chuck Norris shows up to embrace his very own meme. Its the kind of movie in which Statham dons a priests garb and pronounces someone ""man and knife"" before stabbing them. Its the kind of movie where a henchman gets shot while going through an airport scanner. Like I said its ""why not?"" filmmaking at its loudest thriving on familiarity above all else. At its worst the film doubles as the very sight of nostalgia collapsing in on itself. This is what dementia should eventually look like for any child of the 80s as iconic actors begin spouting one anothers catchphrases while other badasses arrive to theme music from films they were never in. When someone rhetorically asks ""Whos next Rambo?"" one might begin wondering whether or not these actors own movies actually exist in the world of these characters. But dont. Dont wonder. Dont think. Its only with that mindset that ""The Expendables 2"" is enjoyable and not merely sad.

But never say never West may be one of the people to blame for the saggy rickety and occasionally winded geriatric action thriller The Expendables 2 but he nevertheless proves the lasting value of a strong first impression. In what might just stand as the most chaotic opening sequence ever filmed Expendables 2 careens out the gate at a reckless pace. Fade in to Nepal as a hooded prisoner in a dark holding cell endures a merciless beating from sneering captors. It only takes a second or two to realize the stranger is in big trouble--and another few seconds to discover that the cavalry is on the way. Speeding over a hill on the horizon Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) is leading a militarized caravan on a rescue operation that is less Navy SEAL stealth than Hollywood shock and awe. The ensuing 10-minute sequence is a cacophony of macho madness featuring rifles sub machine guns bazookas helicopters flying daggers airborne motorcycles shattered helicopters makeshift torpedo/cannons sputtering sea planes brutal decapitations and about 100 gallons of fake blood. Its one of those extended opening onslaughts that conjures memories of similar sequences in Blade 2 Casino Royale or even Raiders of the Lost Ark--a bombastic and inventive amuse-bouche that temporarily elevates the aftertaste of stale leftovers from the first Expendables two years ago. (MORE Nicolas Cage Harrison Ford in The Expendables 3?) Embracing a ""more is better"" strategy that seems to apply to everything from ammunition to casting calls Expendables 2 has successfully supersized its ranks of over-the-hill combat heroes. At the center of the mercenary squad is Stallone flanked once again by trusted number two Jason Statham amateur scientist Dolph Lundgren hot-tempered Terry Crews and token Chinese extra Jet Li (who makes a quick exit from the proceedings) as well as newcomers Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger who make all-too-brief appearances. Also new to the slate are Liam Hemsworth as a young rising sniper whos killed during his final mission by villain Jean-Claude Van Damme--a mission assigned to Stallone and company by a government agent (Bruce Willis returning from his cameo in the original) with a serious grudge against Ross--and Yu Nan a female Chinese codebreaker who cuts through the flirting sexism and grunting machismo to prove that she has the mettle to handle the stress of the battlefield. Its ultimately the death of Hemsworth that propels the action. Ross demands vengeance for his fallen comrade and so off the crew goes to Bulgaria tracking a stolen computer to a vast underground mine where multiple tons of hidden plutonium are now being dug up to be transported to the black market. Through rural impoverished villages deserted Soviet training bases that look like exact replicas of New York City and straight down into the heart of the mine the Expendables crew punches slices and shoots its way through enemy lines. Existing somewhere between action hero revue and gritty first-person-shooter fantasy Expendables 2 may strike a goofier tone than its predecessor but it still finds the most traction when conjuring its stars grittier sides. The opening sequence which spotlights a furrowed ensemble executing ferocious maneuvers is exhilarating for its sheer excess. Envisioning just about every possible firearm motorized vehicle and kill shot imaginable this is genuinely badass bedlam. And more than just inventive in its staging and unhinged in its ferocity the salvo manipulates technology in such a way that we can believe in this bunch of 60-year-olds using big bad gadgets to unleash holy hell. (MORE Will The Bourne Legacy Usher in the Story-Less Movie?) But the same cannot be said for the sequence that follows--or really for any other moment in the movie. In fact one wonders if the budget was blown on scene one because nearly every other action set piece that follows lacks the originality or velocity of the prologue. The more these actors are challenged to engage physically with an unending pageant of nameless henchman the more conventional commonplace and clumsy the fight scenes become. Sure each hero gets his moment in the ring--Statham is the most animated in his church knife fight Sly is the most lumbering in his chain-wielding airport brawl--but the choreography becomes progressively less distinctive. Much the same goes for the dialog that bookends these showdowns as the men grunt about age women guns and regrets without divulging anything remotely revealing. Occasionally co-writers Richard Wink and Stallone succeed in breaking up the violence with humorous quirks Chuck Norris goes full ninja hilariously appearing and disappearing from shootouts at will and Lundgrens character fancies himself an aspiring mathematician and chemist though none of his calculations are ever correct. Van Damme throws himself most convincingly into the storyline embodying an insidious villain who will insult you and steal your sword before he puts you in the ground. (MORE Total Recall Revisited What Colin and Arnold Can Tell Us About Pop Culture) After the likes of The Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man theres something slightly refreshing about a summer blockbuster that relies a little less on computer-animated heroics than on big trucks big guns and a round of beers to celebrate. This is a throwback with nostalgia to spare. But between the opening fireballs and the last call The Expendables is mostly a series of misfires banking on familiar faces and inside jokes but failing to accurately conjure what we came to love about the likes of Stallone Schwarzenegger and Willis in the first place. It wasnt just their physique or their fame that drew us in; Rambo rallied us in his fight against an unjust police force the Terminator scared us silly with his unalterable kill-or-be-killed programming John McClane wowed us with his ability to even up insurmountable odds. These guys became icons because of their characters and these stories. And while West alludes to some of those magical discoveries in his opening free-for-all the remainder of this Expendables feels like little more than a bunch of bored movie stars winking at one another. By the time Arnold cracks his second unfunny ""Ill Be Back"" reference I felt conned. Spoof or not a movie needs to think of something original for its heroes to do.

There may be blood but this is one silly sequel.  (Frank Masi / Alliance Films)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 16 2012The Expendables 2 (out of 4)Starring Sylvester Stallone Jason Statham Jean-Claude Van Damme Arnold Schwarzenegger Bruce Willis Dolph Lundgren Chuck Norris Jet Li Terry Crews Randy Couture and Yu Nan. Directed by Simon West. 103 minutes. Opens Aug. 17 at major theatres. 14ANomination for the years cutest bromantic couple Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham who sport matching berets and brass knuckles in The Expendables 2. Theyre a dangerously darling duo.They have competition. Amongst the many beefy buddies in this steroidal sequel there are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis getting very close and cuddly in a Smart car. Article Continued BelowThese brawny boy-men mean business of course but its mostly funny business. The sole reason for Schwarzeneggers expanded presence now that hes returned from politics to movies full-time is to crack wise with his famous one-liners (""Im back""). But they all take turns playing the clown -- and for the most part its fun to watch them at it even if the body count is distressingly high.Stallones Expendables have all reached the age where theyre as likely to reach for the Botox as for the testosterone supplements and theyre not trying very hard to hide it.Especially since the success of their first film proved the enduring popularity of action heroes in their 50s and 60s all the more so when you cram so much muscle into a single movie. The pumped-up pack has a couple of noteworthy additions (Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris) and subtractions (Mickey Rourke and Steve Austin) plus enlarged cameos (Schwarzenegger and Willis) and returning mainstays (Stallone Statham Dolph Lundgren Jet Li Terry Crews and Randy Couture).Theres also the obligatory tough girl the code-breaking and neck-snapping hottie Maggie (Yu Nan) who becomes an important part of various male missions but is still expected to wait outside the tree fort.Stallones Expendables ringleader Barney pays her what passes for a compliment in this universe after she proves herself an ace at linguistics bomb defusing and martial arts ""Is there anything you dont know?""The plot? Youre kidding right? But it can be summed up in Barneys answer to his slicing sidekick Lee Christmas (Statham) when hes asked ""Whats the plan?""Barney snarls ""Track em. Find em. Kill em.""Theres plenty of this especially the killing part (decapitations are a favourite method) and motivations are two-fold saving the world and payback. The villain du jour who actually is named Vilain has Van Damme hoarding a big stash of weapons-grade plutonium (like theres any other kind?) while also seriously annoying the Expendables with his dastardly deeds.Its like watching a hog wallow at a fall fair all mud blood and squealing. And its set to the most incongruous pop soundtrack ever with tunes The Young Rascals ""Groovin"" making mass slaughter seem like a great way to while away a Sunday afternoon.Simon West (Con Air) working with a script by Stallone and Richard Wenk directs with efficiency but with more blunt force than panache. It begins with a Nepal fortress rescue that is built around battering rams machine guns and cheesy one-liners.West is fully in on the joke though and he does allow Stallone who directed the first film to concentrate on what passes for acting. Stallone is not a guy you want to confuse.Quirks they have a few which makes these Expendables so endearing. Barney loves skull symbols even putting them on his designer ballpoint pen. Henpecked Lee has a cell phone that quacks whenever his lady calls and hes apparently the only guy getting any serious female attention.Jet Lis Yin Yang is handy with pots and pans when his gun fails. And Chuck Norris arrives to the sound of Ennio Morricones spaghetti western theme and with a funny story about a cobra. Weird how Norris has started to look like Tim Allen in his old age.At no point does anybody take any of this seriously even when the inevitable showdown occurs between Stallone and Van Damme a matchup long hoped for by fans of the genre.It was evidently more of a workout for their stuntmen judging by how much of it was shot in near darkness. This will become more of a necessity as the franchise continues -- Expendables 3 is already in the works -- along with the relentless aging process. I can imagine a future Expendables shot entirely in the dark with only the sounds of guns and grunts to guide us. All least well know theyre all smiling.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"The Expendables 2 (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Expendables 2 (R) A dispiriting lack of effort sinks this would-be guilty pleasure. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/15/2012 Editor rating 1 At one point late in The Expendables 2 Sylvester Stallone Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger stand shoulder to shoulder in the same frame using enormous machine guns to blast away at some bad guys. The sight of the three huge stars in the same movie doing something other than talking (which is all they did in the previous film) should be funny and exciting and nostalgic -- a sort of wish-fulfillment fantasy for action-movie fans. Instead all you notice is how Schwarzenegger whose stint in politics has left him with a bit of a paunch winces when he fires his weapon as if he were a little afraid of it. Or how Stallones face has been pulled and stretched to the point that it is almost grotesque (his expression rarely changes whether hes blowing up a tank or tying his shoelaces). Or how utterly bored and unengaged Willis looks as if he were wondering how much longer he needs to hang around before the production wraps and he can go home and cash his paycheck. Released in the summer of 2010 The Expendables grossed almost 300 million worldwide. A sequel was inevitable especially since the project was Stallones baby and he hasnt been working much lately so what else is he going to do? Sensitive to complaints by fans that several of the biggest names in the cast barely appeared in the first movie Stallone made sure that Willis and Schwarzenegger hang around for more than just cameos this time. Jean-Claude Van Damme who declined to appear in the previous film changed his mind when he saw the grosses and signed on to play the heavy. Chuck Norris is also in this movie although you should know that he gets roughly five minutes of screen time half of those devoted to his telling of a Chuck Norris joke. That is as funny as the movies self-aware humor gets. Stallone co-wrote The Expendables 2 with Richard Wenk (The Mechanic 16 Blocks) and he handed over the directorial reins to Simon West (Con Air Lara Croft Tomb Raider) who knows how to orchestrate enormous set-pieces. West throws in everything he can think of -- car chases boat chases truck chases foot chases jet-ski chases -- but he doesnt cut it together well so the action becomes abstract Its all explosions and guns and crashes and unnaturally loud punches with faceless nameless stuntmen taking all the risks. West also cant overcome the vanity of his large aging cast who force him to shoot them only from flattering angles and to go easy on the harsh lights please. There are some close-ups of Stallone that are so fuzzy youd swear the movie was out of focus. As usual Jason Statham emerges from the debacle unscathed Hes such a committed actor that even a movie this bad cant sink him. Hes the only one though. Liam Hemsworth little brother to Thors Chris Hemsworth plays a sniper whose name might as well been Sacrificial Lamb. You know hes a goner the moment you see him because he makes his co-stars look way too old (also you can understand his line readings because his face has not yet been immobilized by Botox). Terry Crews and Randy Couture who had things to do in the first film basically stand around in the background this time. Jet Li literally parachutes out of the movie early never to return because there simply isnt enough in this flimsy script to keep all these characters occupied. There are however loads of horrendous one-liners (""Rest in pieces"") some lame attempts at meta-humor (Schwarzenegger ""Ill be back."" Willis ""Youve been back enough. Ill be back"") and some brief horrifying glimpses at plastic surgery gone way wrong. Van Damme whose English has gotten a lot worse since the last time we saw him wears sunglasses for most of the movie even when hes burrowing deep underground to steal some plutonium which initially seems like a curious choice. Why hide the handsome actors mug? Then he takes them off and you immediately understand. The Expendables 2 barely qualifies as a movie but it does make for a fascinating study on male vanity. Most of these actors are extremely fit with the bodies of muscular 30-year-olds but theres nothing they can do about the lines and creases in their faces except take surgical jackhammers to them. The results are not pretty. Rumor is a third Expendables movie is already in the works with Steven Seagal Harrison Ford and Nicolas Cage potentially joining the cast. Id rather see a film where all these actors sit around playing poker and joshing each other than have to sit through another shoot-em-up for septuagenarians.

So resumes the machine-gun etiquette and repartee--""Oh shit"" ""Arggghhh"" ""Yeahhh"" ""Whoo-rah""--of the titular soldiers of fortune returning from Sylvester Stallones 2010 nostalgia victory lap. This time around the Expendables (Stallone Jason Statham and assorted beef) cinch on their trusses to chase a Great Whatsit across Cold War-istan and race against a dastardly curiously made-up Jean-Claude Van Damme who radiates an amusing aristocratic disdain. Director Simon West has previously shown a knack for brazenly overinflating action cliches until they giddily pop--notably in 1997 classic-of-a-sort Con Air--and his Expendables 2 does admittedly discover some ingenious new methods for disassembling the human form. But any glee is offset by the films weakness for mechanical self-reference encompassing joyless one-liner nods to the assembled actors filmographies and a knowing attitude toward the films Hall of Fame cavalcade-of-cameos nature--Chuck Norris and a windblown and slightly spooked Arnold Schwarzenegger pass through--making a sour joke of flaunting its outright cash-in cynicism (actual exchange ""Thanks for stopping by."" ""My pleasure""). Has the parallel between the actor and the mercenarys trade ever been so overt?

Thats the dilemma of the first minutes of The Expendables 2 as his ageing mercenary flies his warplane low over water and struggles to clear a dam. Stallone is back for a second stab at recapturing the glory days of 80s action cinema and so are co-stars Jason Statham Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren. There are cameos once again from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger but Mickey Rourkes gone awol. Fans of bargain-bin beat-em-ups need not worry however for Jean-Claude Van Damme steps in to play a villain with a stash of plutonium and Chuck Norris pops up as a lone wolf. In some ways this is better than the first film it ditches tedious backstories and chats between saggy has-beens in favour of more stabbings shootings and decapitations which makes it a more honest proposition. There are some corny one-liners and a bit more self-mockery. But its still a ropey film and - hair dye and wrinkles aside - if someone told you that the negative was found on the shelf of a studio that went bankrupt in 1991 youd most likely believe them.

TWITTER Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first significant post-political role joins Sylvester Stallone Bruce Willis Jason Statham Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren in the action-filled sequel. Capping off the summer box office with explosive action The Expendables 2 offers the sendoff adrenaline junkies are seeking before the more sedate pace of fall releases. As he proved with the original installment Sylvester Stallone grasps the action-oriented DNA of the films badass cast of reprobate mercenaries with an intuition derived from dozens of genre roles. Without any similar competition among this weeks openers the Lionsgate sequel should fare extremely well against remaining holdovers though exceeding the 2010 originals surprising 274 million in worldwide box office might be a stretch PHOTOS 80s Action Stars Where Are They Now? Without wasting any time on setup the sequel finds Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team of hard-bitten mercenaries on a clandestine mission to extract a kidnapped Chinese billionaire in Nepal where they discover that someone has gotten there before them -- Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) another operative for their contractor Mr. Church (Bruce Willis). Freeing Trench and the billionaire from their captors the team returns to the States where Church confronts Barney with an unpleasant reminder The Expendables leader owes Church 5 million in confiscated cash from a previous job. But he is prepared to make a deal if Barney takes on a new assignment. The catch is that he will need to place Churchs operative on his team Chinese tech expert Maggie (Yu Nan). Since the Expendables are an all-male crew the addition of a woman almost immediately throws group dynamics out of kilter. Their assignment is to retrieve an undisclosed item from a high-tech electronic safe aboard a downed plane that has crashed in Albania. Although new team member and Afghanistan vet Billy (Liam Hemsworth) an expert sniper reluctantly tells Barney that this is his last outing the rest of the Expendables relish another mission including second-in-command Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) and team members Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews). STORY Sylvester Stallone Defeats Lawsuit Claiming The Expendables Was Ripped Off As soon as Maggie has decoded the safe aboard the crashed plane and extracted the contents the Expendables are ambushed by an Eastern European crime cartel led by the sadistic Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who forces Barney to turn over the device from the safe and then kills a key team member. Maggie later reveals that the item stolen by Vilain is a miniature computer containing the location of a five-ton cache of plutonium that the Russians stashed in an abandoned mine during the Cold War. Motivated as much by revenge as their realigned mission to prevent Vilain from selling the weapons-grade nuclear material to a list of willing buyers the Expendables take off in pursuit of their adversaries with Barneys directive uppermost in their minds ""Track them find them kill them."" VIDEO Expendables 2 Star Sylvester Stallone Calls Film a Minor Miracle While most of the original films action transpired in Latin America Expendables 2 relocates to Bulgaria which offers appropriately expansive vistas and credible locations for the Eastern European settings. Taking over directing duties from Stallone Simon West preserves the hardboiled action and wisecracking cast dynamics of the original channeling some of the B-movie tonal elements he might have picked up directing Con Air. Managing the complexity of stunts aircraft and vehicle pileups and frequent shootouts that comprise the majority of the running time is a major challenge that West executes with elan even adding unexpected grace notes to some otherwise routine scenes. Abetted by cinematographer and action-adventure specialist Shelly Johnson whose camera placement and movement are spot-on the action choreography never disappoints. Numerous gunfights combat set pieces and fight scenes are muscularly staged and skillfully supported by Todd E. Millers editing though the sheer sound volume grows repetitive and wearying. With such an expansive cast theres a risk that the quality of performances might be diluted by the quantity of recognizable actors. But co-screenwriter Richard Wenk and Stallone have generously given both major players and cameo actors their own often quite -humorous character traits and dialogue. When Schwarzenegger is onscreen much of the banter is at the former California governors expense -- though much as ever he gets some memorable lines himself. STORY Arnold Schwarzenegger on Bodybuilding Steroids and His Love of Sylvester Stallone Working with a fairly routine action-adventure scenario the filmmakers can leave the cast to adequately fill out their roles. Since many of the leads have well-known personas from past films and franchises performances are a blend of action-hero impassivity and sendups of familiar characters. Stallone anchors the cast with a sometimes nuanced interpretation of Barneys mix of personal and professional demons and plays it straight as a foil to Stathams put-upon sidekick. A late scene with Van Dammes suitably sadistic villain shows that Stallones still got the charisma to carry an intimately staged fight sequence. Lundgren gets great comic mileage out of Gunners lunkheaded character while Couture and Crews hold down the stalwart combat veterans shtick. Despite key roles Hemsworth and Yu dont add much to the ensemble and Chuck Norris as Booker and Jet Li as Yin Yang appear too briefly to make much impact. Many might wonder about Schwarzeneggers return to action movies and might be pleased that the brief role of Trench is a perfect fit adorned with some of the best dialogue in the script. While hes every bit as creaky as the other vets his age relying more on very large weapons and cutting humor than unarmed combat Schwarzenegger still can steal a scene particularly in the final set piece where hes paired with Willis who relies more on smirking threats than decisive action until the final reel. Pyrotechnic and special effects credits are superior on a reasonable budget and though the soundtrack would have benefited from a higher ratio of contemporary hits to familiar classics Brian Tylers score carries the action without overwhelming it.

""Male-pattern badness"" in the words of Bruce Willis whose own smooth-shaven pate lends the joke an extra curl of irony. With Willis Sylvester Stallone and roughly a dozen B-through-Z-movie icons returning for sequel duty plus Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris for good measure this muscle-bound meathead extravaganza is a sometimes blissfully cretinous endeavor delivering the maximum firepower and zero brainpower its target audience expects. Surprisingly junkier-looking than its hit predecessor the Lionsgate release should still land in the same commercial ballpark. Having directed himself and his brawny ensemble with more energy than coherence in 2010s ""The Expendables"" Stallone turns over the helming reins to Simon West well prepared for this gig based on his past experience shepherding burning planes (""Con Air"") and Jason Statham (""The Mechanic""). On a visual level West seems to have taken the idea of ""down-and-dirty"" rather too literally; from its initial blowout to its climactic slugfest this is one ugly tank of a movie shot in murky shades of brown gray and yellow that suggest the actors were afflicted by an outbreak of jaundice. As scripted by Stallone and Richard Wenk the pic isnt much better to listen to. What it does offer in spades is the sort of self-referential humor that labors at every turn to make clear that the actors -- chiefly Arnold Schwarzenegger who doesnt give a performance here so much as a recitation of ""Terminator"" references -- are in on the joke the idea being that all the good-natured winking and ribbing will somehow translate into viewer enjoyment. And from time to time with all the reliability of the gangs creaky old seaplane it does. After a fairly exciting and completely irrelevant 15-minute opening salvo in Nepal ringleader Barney Ross (Stallone) and his hardened crew bid a hasty farewell to their token Chinese member Yin Yang (Jet Li in and out) only to inherit another Maggie (Yu Nan) a skilled codebreaker who joins them in their next mission. Alas said mission costs them one of their best and brightest a sensitive young sniper (Liam Hemsworth) mercilessly slain by a crime kingpin so villainous hes actually named Vilain (Van Damme). Clearly its payback time. Or at least it will be once the pic dispenses with a few draggy character-building scenes and painful one-liners as when Swedish meathead Gunner (Dolph Lundgren) fixes Maggie with a meaningful stare and murmurs ""Id really die for some Chinese."" This is followed by an ostensibly more chivalrous bit of male-female interaction in which Barney warns Maggie to keep her emotional distance lest she too become a victim. Maggie were told is good with a knife but her weapon of choice here is the contemptuous smirk the assumption being that the bold gesture of adding a woman to the cast precludes the need to give her anything interesting to do. Far deadlier are newcomer Booker (Norris) a lone-ranger assassin whose dynamic entrance occasions a cheesy blast of Ennio Morricone and Barneys trusty No. 2 Lee Christmas (Statham) who can be counted on to turn an airplane propeller into a handy decapitation device. As for the other men on the team they all emerge from the experience with little more than scrapes and bruises spraying their nemeses with almost as many catchphrases as bullets. ""I got this"" grunts Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) right before firing off a few thousand rounds allowing the actor to distinguish himself a bit from his virtually interchangeable co-stars Scott Adkins and Randy Couture. In their closing bout Stallone and Van Damme come to resemble two swinging sides of beef -- both tough leathery and flayed almost beyond recognition but not quite. Recognition indeed is the chief and perhaps sole pleasure this picture is selling Its the ostensible thrill of seeing all these action-movie avatars trying to outmuscle each other onscreen never mind how many lapses in logic and pointless plot contortions were necessary to bring them together in the first place. Pic generates some unique production value from its mostly Bulgarian locations and the hyper-violent action sequences more than earn their R rating though their impact is disappointingly mitigated by the quick haphazard editing and a grimy visual scheme that turns blood the color of mud. The high volume of deafening explosions necessitated a great deal of distractingly post-dubbed dialogue also forced to compete with a hemorrhaging score and an insistently nostalgic soundtrack of 60s and 70s tunes.
