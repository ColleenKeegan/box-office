Because the crowd-pleasing analogue spectacle of The Poseidon Adventure was so clearly ripe for a Hollywood digital update? Because its plot about a luxury cruise ship hit by a rogue tidal wave taps right into all those post-9/11 post-tsunami post-Katrina anxieties? Because Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot The Perfect Storm) is running out of boat ideas? Whatever the reason Poseidon proves a distinctly conservative venture. A flashy David Cameron conservative mind you. Its pacy and exciting trowelling on plenty of shoddy CGI slap and offering a brand new cast of characters. Gone is Reverend Gene Hackman haranguing his faithful herd from ballroom up to propellor shaft in favour of gambler Josh Lucas trying to sneak off to safety alone. Hes stopped by nine-year-old Conor (Jimmy Bennett) asking to tag along with his single mum (Jacinda Barrett) before being joined by Richard Dreyfuss playing a recently dumped suicidal gay architect and Kurt Russells Robert Ramsey both a former firefighter and former mayor of New York () who demands they first track down his teenage daughter Emmy Rossum and her boyfriend (Mike Vogel). Where 1972s crew conjured a rousing communality 2006s film offers a line-up of loners struggling to stay together and lacks the same momentum as a result. It also fails to tease out the contemporary resonances or adequately integrate emotion with action - why is Russell quizzing Rossum about her boyfriend while theyre zipping over a lake of flaming oil on a commando line? - and serves up a reactionary body count of one villain one hero and two immigrants. Nevertheless Petersens expert direction ensures it remains gripping keeping the tension ratcheted right up and commendably steering it all home within 100 minutes.

It isnt kitschy enough to deserve a Velveeta mention. There was a glimmer of cheesy hope when the Black Eyed Peas singer Stacy Ferguson appeared at the New Years Eve blowout on the luxury liner named for the god of the sea. In her form-fitting gown she could have been mistaken for Charo. And while the ships survivors are driven to live ""Poseidon"" is never character-driven enough to make us care. Indeed the movie starring Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell as the alpha-male duo trying to take a group from the top to the bottom of the overturned ship doesnt even reach the emotional watermark of director Wolfgang Petersens previous voyage ""The Perfect Storm."" Be honest what were you expecting from this Hollywood cruise into the vaults? Extra special effects and maybe some folks to root for. ""Better effects crueler script"" might be the tagline for this retold tale. Theres no arguing that when the big computer-generated ""rogue wave"" hits youre in for a visual ride. I for one though miss that mountain of water announcing itself as a green streak across a radar screen the way it did in the 1972 original. Is ""Poseidon"" more amazing than another flick about a ship going down? What was it called? Oh yeah ""Titanic""? Of course not. Its just more. More rushing water; more unquenchable fires; more flying crashing crushing debris; more broken burned floating bodies. In an impressive touch the ships swimming pools dump their contents into the sea as the wave turns the Poseidon into a hapless surfer in a North Shore pipeline nightmare. Is it more indelible than disaster maestro Irwin Allens insta- classic starring Gene Hackman Roddy McDowell and floating above them all Shelley Winters? Not on Mrs. Belle Rosens life. Before the new Poseidon meets its unmaking we meet the cast. With Lucas Russell Richard Dreyfuss and Emmy Rossum (""The Phantom of the Opera"") its not a bad crew. But they are set adrift by a flat script written by Mark Protosevich (""The Cell""). Except for the palpable terror of a waiter played by Freddy Rodriguez (""Six Feet Under"") theres little ballast to give moving weight to the disaster. It isnt for lack of trying. Theres the forlorn gay man (Dreyfuss) who forgoes suicidal thoughts when he has to fight for his life. Theres the over-protective father and his bristling- to-be-free daughter. Theres a mother and young son (played by Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennett) who melt Lucas hardened professional gambler Dylan Johns. But their connections are handled hurriedly. Lets get back to the lethal flotsam. Russell steps in as former New York City Mayor Robert Ramsey. He may have mastered a couple of universes (though really theres no way he would ever have been elected da mayor of that burg) but Ramsey cant keep his daughter (Rossum) under his protective gear forever. Russell and Lucas strain for onscreen authority. Yet when Russells character tells someone ""I used to be a fireman"" everyone in the audience will be tempted to quip ""Wasnt that in ""Backdraft?"" Parents be warned. If the film has a child in danger consider it a hard PG-13. Here the filmmakers feel compelled to plunge a young boy into a scene that while true to the disaster goes beyond the pale. But then the visual grammar of horror flicks is overtaking other genres. When cinematographer John Seale trains his lens on the bottom of an elevator shaft full of twisted metal we know its only a matter of time before someone will be impaled. And when poker-playing lout Lucky Larry mouths off not only can you bet the farm his lucks about to run out but ""Poseidon"" has led us to hope it may. And in the end what sort of hope is that?

"Shipshape Remake washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Shipshape Remake Worst vacation ever Jacinda Barrett Jimmy Bennett and Josh Lucas in Wolfgang Petersens leaner and meaner remake of the 1972 disaster movie. (By Claudette Barius -- Warner Bros. Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 12 2006 ""Poseidon"" is two words shorter in title and 20 minutes shorter in running time than ""The Poseidon Adventure"" its beloved 1972 predecessor. Its not so much a remake as an abbreviation. Maybe it should have been called ""Posdn."" You might say Come on. Without the blubbery excess (Red Buttons Shelley Winters) without the camp stylings and kitschy hamboning (Red Buttons Shelley Winters) ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is just another boat movie. Or you might say ""Poseidon"" isnt a ship its a freight train that just goes faster and faster. It plays like ""Titanic"" if ""Titanic"" had begun at Minute 127. Loathing (but in a good way) both Red Buttons and Shelley Winters I happen to prefer by far the second edition. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" has been fixed not neutered. Begin with the title The word ""adventure"" never belonged in a movie about a disaster. Gee about a thousand people die Is that an adventure? Would 9/11 or Hiroshima then qualify as ""adventures?"" The director of the new movie the German uber-pro Wolfgang Petersen knows a little about disasters particularly those at sea. He was many years ago the genius behind ""Das Boot"" that odyssey of German submariners. There he showed a peculiar gift for evoking the cramped mega-mechanical hell called an U nterseeboot  and the existential horror of people trapped beneath the sea while explosions beat the hell and the spirit out of them. It wasnt much fun and it wasnt very pretty. He brings that same imagination for ordeal to this film. He leaves out largely character back story anecdote warm personal relations and a discussion of Christian duty (as represented in ""The Poseidon Adventure"" by the Rev. Gene Hackman and the Rev. Arthur OConnell). Petersens movie isnt cute funny warm nice inspirational or uplifting. Its about the incredible labor of survival in a world turned totally sociopathic in an instant. And Petersen doesnt waste any time getting to that instant. The big wave hits the luxury liner Poseidon somewhere east of Java about 15 minutes into the movie. When it hits it hits like a sledgehammer wielded by an angry sea god who doesnt like ships that look like the cities in 50s sci-fi movies. Petersen doesnt spare the carnage. People die in the hundreds the thousands. And when they die their bodies float in the sloppage of water that sloshes through the topsy-turvy decks or lie all twisty-still and bloodied from concussion (for some reasons he sees explosions as a necessary result of a big ship going over). Against this carnival of death the film quickly isolates a small team of free thinkers. Unlike the sheep who believe in the biblical assurances from Capt. Michael Bradford (Andre Braugher) that all is well and that the tipped boat will be quickly righted these free thinkers head up trusting their instincts over official bromides. The two main guys are high-end gamblers (not much background as I say is given) played by Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas and Lucas becomes messy so fast (his beard seems to be stimulated by adrenaline and grows out two weeks worth in what cant be much more than three hours) that he ceases to remind you of some weird DNA lab orgy that has somehow interwoven Matthew McConaugheys gene strips with Paul Newmans. Kind of creepy if you ask me but I cannot seem to get any woman I know to agree with me. Anyhow they attract a few others who happen merely to be standing next to them when they start the journey. These consist of a mother and son; a wealthy heartbroken gay man (Richard Dreyfuss in the combined Red Buttons/Shelley Winters role); and an unattached beauty who gravitates between the two blond guys. Later they encounter Russells daughter (I know a fantastic meet) and her boyfriend who happen to have survived on a slightly higher -- i.e. lower -- deck (since the ship is now upside down). Kevin Dillon is briefly attached to the unit as well but when he says ""It all comes down to luck"" in a giant bad Texas accent you know his is about to run out. The three women are Brunette No. 1 Brunette No. 2 and Brunette No. 3 all beautiful all tall all hard to tell apart. Clearly a little Charlies Angels maneuvering of ethnic typology and hair coloring might have helped the clarity issue. For the record the three are Jacinda Barrett (the mom) Emmy Rossum (the daughter) and Mia Maestro (the eligible one). Does it matter? No because the movie is not about being its about doing. Its basically an ordeal by ordeal. Its one damn thing after another and the personalities emerge from the action they arent imposed on it. Theres no intra-squad politicking no coups or revolutions. The movie unlike the quasi-religious gimmickry of the first is utterly uninterested in metaphor. The movie isnt about anything except seven people trying to survive a disaster and some make it and some dont. It certainly gets the three most annoying things about water It is wet there is a lot of it and it wants to kill you. The water actually stalks them and Petersen a sadist to the end loves to trap his squirming rats in dark narrow spaces such as ducts or chambers and watch them fight their panic as the wet endless killing stuff roars around them. Up up it goes until only flaring nostrils are left. Not pretty. If youre claustrophobic or hydrophobic if you dont like dead things especially people this aint the movie for you. In fact far less than ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (Shelley Winters Red Buttons) ""Poseidon"" reminds me of the short story ""The Open Boat"" (Stephen Crane) that remorseless existential tale about men robbed of their personalities by the intensity of the life-or-death ordeal that they face and the whimsy with which God or nature toys with their destinies. Thats one of the harsh lessons of this harsh movie The good dont die young and the young dont die good. Most people just die and as in Cranes primordial seascape the ones who live are the ones who got lucky. Nobody says it but the movie decodes to a survivors epiphany in ""The Open Boat"" Nature "" . . . did not seem cruel to him nor beneficent nor treacherous nor wise. But she was indifferent flatly indifferent."" Poseidon (97 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 but includes extremely intense scenes of carnage and death by drowning and explosion.

Comments Poseidon A gigantic slab of American cheese The Poseidon Adventure (1972) was typical of the Vietnam-era disaster movies apart from the spectacle of wholesale destruction its dramatic focus was the question of leadership as passengers aboard an overturned ocean liner tried to decide whose cockamamy plan would deliver them from doom. After 9/11 and Katrina this megabudget remake by Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) benefits from a similar cultural oomph though its just as enjoyably silly as the original. With Kurt Russell (as the former mayor of New York) Josh Lucas (as his antagonist a professional gambler) Andre Braugher Jacinda Barrett Emmy Rossum Kevin Dillon and Richard Dreyfuss in the Red Buttons role--giant shoes for any man to fill.

It nearly drowns under the weight of its own soggy tedium. The sole reason to see it if you must is for the special effects and stunts. And even those eventually grow numbing with the constant barrage of roiling flood water fiery explosions hurtling bodies and gruesome deaths. What a contrast with a true disaster epic like United 93 where the hideous outcome was understated and therefore that much more poignant and devastating. IN DEPTH Graphic Poseidon could upset viewers Of course this is the re-make of the 1972 original with the notable addition of state-of the-art computer generated imagery. Even without the technological boost The Poseidon Adventure had more suspense and tension perhaps because we knew a bit about the characters and cared a whit more. This time around we are given only about 15 minutes of disaster-free exposition in which to get a sense of the key players. Then during a New Years Eve celebration a 150-foot tall ""rogue wave"" slaps the 20-story tall luxury liner and sends it reeling setting off a chain of upheaval and calamity that rather than seeming frightening merely comes across as overkill. Director Wolfgang Petersen responsible for Das Boot and The Perfect Storm clearly knows about making movies that involve choppy seas. But both of those films were more nerve-wracking and engrossing than this waterlogged exercise in peril. We follow the fortunes of a half dozen people who decide to flout the rules and follow the lead of Josh Lucas by making a break out of the ship which is slowly sinking. Kurt Russell who plays a former fireman-turned-mayor with a contentious relationship with his daughter played by Emmy Rossumis part of the cadre of brave rebels. Theres no guessing game as to who will survive and who wont. Its pretty evident from the start whos going to make it (spoiler alert ethnic minorities dont fare well.) Lucas and Russell do a fine job portraying heroes. Its just too bad that the lines they are given are not on par with their acting skills. Cliches are pitched about as wildly as the ship is tossed. Unintentionally laughable lines abound like the one uttered by a stowaway (Mia Maestro) as she screws up the courage to enter a chamber filled with charred corpses ""Its just dead people right?"" When the captain played by Andre Braugher greets the guests at the start of the nights party he explains that Poseidon is the god of the sea. ""What better way to celebrate"" he asks ""than on the back of the old fellow himself?"" And thats really all this re-make is about riding on the back of an old movies success.

Poseidon plunges into the deep end. 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Poseidon Action. Starring Kurt Russell Richard Dreyfuss Emmy Rossum and Josh L ucas. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) All movies even remakes deserve to be judged on their own terms. But theres something about the contrast between the 1972 ""Poseidon Adventure"" and the all-new ""Poseidon"" that points up an interesting difference between the way movies tell stories today and the way they told them 34 years ago. Usually when any of us tells a story even if its just an anecdote among friends we have a point -- not a message or a moral necessarily but a discernible reason for telling it. And people react to the story by reacting to its point by their eyebrows going up by their saying ""Oh yeah"" or laughing. (Tell a story without a point and they just stand there dumbfounded.) Likewise action movies used to have a point too a justification for the time investment that went beyond ""Here are some interesting things that happened."" The old ""Poseidon Adventure"" came out of that earlier tradition. But in Wolfgang Petersens ""Poseidon"" we see an exemplar of a new tradition in which stringing together interesting incidents constitutes enough justification for an entire movie. And so in the remake the connective tissue that held the original picture together -- the human interest the odd air of mysticism the evolving relationships -- has been stripped away while the action scenes have been expanded fortified and no question about it made more effective. The result is odd and yet all too common An experience thats exciting and nerve-racking in the moment but that in the end leaves audiences with a lonely walk back to the car. Even more odd this emptiness comes not through any failure of execution on the filmmakers part but by design. ""Poseidon"" is the movie they wanted to make -- a movie not about the triumph of the human spirit not about the value of sacrifice and not about the virtues of resiliency and innovation. Instead -- like some time-lapse photography showing human evolution going backward -- its about two things and two things only 1) The sheer exuberant joy of surviving especially when everybody else is dead; and 2) All the cool things that can happen when an ocean liner capsizes. How cool? Well very cool actually. When Petersen flips that ship he flips it slowly and milks it for every falling elevator passenger every electrocuted crewman and every screaming lady in a flaming ball gown. I dont even remember dead bodies in the original ""Poseidon Adventure"" but here its safe to say that there are hundreds of young actors who just got their Screen Actors Guild cards by playing formally attired corpses -- each one with a carefully composed quizzical-dead expression on its face. Its strange to say it but the corpses are a welcome addition. ""Poseidon"" takes place in an alternative universe identical to our own except that the passengers aboard the Poseidon have apparently never seen a disaster movie. If they did theyd know that to have a boisterous New Years Eve celebration aboard an ocean liner is an act of supreme hubris the equivalent of saying to the universe ""Please kill us."" The cosmic smackdown in this case takes the form of a ""rogue wave"" which overturns everything and gets the New Year off to a disagreeable start. Its a shame too because it was a nice boat with glassed-in elevators like the ones in ""The Towering Inferno"" -- two disaster movies for the price of one. All new characters make up the new picture so dont try to figure out who gets to be Shelley Winters. Kurt Russell plays the former mayor of New York City (thats about all we know about him) who has a querulous daughter (Emmy Rossum) and a mild-mannered future son-in-law (Mike Vogel). This time theres no one leader (Gene Hackman had that role last time). The mayor and a gambler Dylan (Josh Lucas) share those duties. They know everything about ships. Theyre amazing guys. Jacinda Barrett plays a single mom with a young son. Richard Dreyfuss plays a gay ... actually hes just gay. Thats it. Thats the role. But just imagine the license that playing gay gives an actor of Dreyfuss flamboyance. At least Dreyfuss does something with the part and the bonding between his character and a hapless stowaway (Mia Maestro) has a hint of emotional richness of an older man recognizing a younger womans outsider status understanding her feelings of isolation and reaching out to her. But this is just a tiny fraction of the movie and in terms of real emotion this is all ""Poseidon"" has. But it does have action scenes and theyre good tapping into every kind of elemental fear -- of fire of water of falling of being buried alive. A scene in which the principal cast is trapped inside a narrow heating vent as the water rises is harrowing. But you wont be thinking about ""Poseidon"" the next day. This ones strictly for folks who dont feel theres got to be a morning after. -- Advisory This film contains many dead bodies convincingly played and tense action sequences.

Others are classics by virtue of vast cultural brainwashing a gradual cross-generational mind-shift only loosely related to the films artistic worth. Such a film is Irwin Allens The Poseidon Adventure the durable 1972 yarn based on Paul Gallicos novel about a capsized cruiseliner and the handful of stragglers who survive. It was never a good movie only an endearing one its wooden acting and ungainly preachiness having aged into a fondly remembered high-kitsch exemplar. Packed between Gene Hackmans sermonizing and Shelley Winters death scene (a triumph for pudgy grandmas everywhere) were enough heinous 70s tuxedo shirts to solve the energy crisis. God and polyester Whats not to love? But if The Poseidon Adventure was pure camp classic Wolfgang Petersens uninspired re-do succeeds at neither -- its not camp and its not classic. The new film drops two-thirds of the title along with the pudgy grandma and every last metaphysical rumination on religion and human affairs. (A puffy tuxedo shirt remains.) Hackman the preacher-man has been replaced by Josh Lucas the gambler and Kurt Russell the ex-mayor two who survive a massive mid-Atlantic ""rogue wave"" that smacks the Poseidon upside its hull one New Years Eve flipping boat and sodden revelers on their heads. Among the upended most sit tight in the ballroom awaiting rescue -- dumb dumb dumb -- rather than climb up to ships bottom where they might escape. ""This room is a giant air bubble holding up the ship"" assures the captain (stentorian brow-beater Andre Braugher very wisely cast). Taking issue with his Archimedean logic is a jilted lover (Richard Dreyfuss) who was just about to pitch himself overboard when disaster struck. ""Im an architect -- these ships werent designed to stay afloat upside down"" he asserts to which relieved viewers might add Well thank the lord for architects or I might not have known. Dreyfuss the lover Lucas the gambler and Russell the ex-mayor make their way upward along with a stowaway (Mia Maestro) a drunken lout (Kevin Dillon who wears the puffy shirt and wears it well) a crew member (Freddy Rodriguez) a single mom (Jacinda Barrett) her son (Jimmy Bennett) the ex-mayors daughter (Emmy Rossum) and the ex-mayors daughters fiance (Mike Vogel). A few of these characters have ""early bite it"" stamped on their foreheads. Some die ignominiously some die heroically all die to jerk maximum tears -- but none strikes a blow to the heart. They just dont matter. Are we all so inured to death-at-sea scenarios (Titanic or Petersens The Perfect Storm -- the second of his three nautical films) that one more bobbing corpse doesnt do it any longer? Or should we blame Poseidons undeveloped characters and pan-flat dialogue? Key connecting scenes seem to be missing. Im all for brisk pacing and short running times but Mark Protosevichs (The Cell) screenplay could have packed in a bit more character development before ramming the boat to its computer-generated doom -- a whole 16 minutes into the movie. During the climbing and swimming and panicking and electrocuting that follow Petersen flexes his knack for action in tight dark places; his movies are hell for claustrophobes. But this ones not much fun for anyone else either. As much as Poseidon pumps up the spectacle it scrimps on the humanity and humor -- God and polyester -- that might have kept the ship afloat. Upside down or right side up it sinks. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Bushnell Off Trail GPS for 29 + free shipping Marc New York Womens Lace Sheath Dress for 26 + 8 samp;h 3P Military Tactical Oxford 30L Backpack for 12 + free shipping Kids Jackets at Columbia Up to 70% off + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Movies these days particularly big tent-pole franchise movies are almost always overlong. The relative briskness of ""Poseidon"" ensures that things wont get bogged down. If a sequence is dull you can be sure it will soon be replaced by another and another.And since most of the action in this Wolfgang Petersen melodrama is spectacular theres little need to worry. Petersen has twice before navigated his way through these shoals in his great U-boat picture ""Das Boot"" and the not-so-great ""The Perfect Storm"" (which did have that amazing monster wave to recommend it).""Poseidon"" has little relationship to the 1972 film ""The Poseidon Adventure"" except for its name and premise a mammoth luxury cruise ship in the North Atlantic is hit by a rogue wave rolls completely upside down and begins to sink. I have a fondness for the original which helped inaugurate the tsunami of disaster flicks such as ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Earthquake"" that followed in its wake. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Being bunkered for almost two hours with Gene Hackman Red Buttons Shelley Winters Roddy McDowall Stella Stevens and the pre-""Airplane"" Leslie Nielsen was camp heaven. It beats being trapped with the new movies crew which includes Kurt Russell Josh Lucas Richard Dreyfuss Emmy Rossum Kevin Dillon and Jacinda Barrett - a much more straight-faced bunch. ""Poseidon"" would have been better if it was over the top. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 But Petersen is a rather humorless sort. He sticks to the bare bones of the plot and provides very little in the way of comic relief. The personal stories of the main characters are quickly sketched in and then set aside. Nothing impedes the forward momentum.The festivities begin in the main ballroom of the cruise ship Poseidon on New Years Eve. The ship stands 20 stories high and once the wave hits and things go belly up a band of stalwarts try to work their way through all 13 passenger decks in order to escape.Robert Ramsey (Russell) a recently divorced former fireman and improbably the ex-mayor of New York and professional gambler Dylan Johns (Lucas) head up a squad that also includes Ramseys headstrong daughter (Rossum) and fiance (Mike Vogel) a protective single mother (Barrett) and her son and a stowaway trying to reach New York to be with her sick brother. Richard Dreyfuss plays a despondent millionaire who is taking the cruise solo because at the last minute his male lover jilted him.Dreyfuss seems to be in the movie as a kind of good-luck charm. When he starts paddling frantically he gives off ""Jaws"" vibes. (I notice in the press notes that Dreyfuss and some others involved in the movie took a cruise on the Queen Mary 2 for ""research"" purposes. Nice work if you can get it.)Of course not everyone will make it to safety and one of the genres pleasures - if you can call it that - is trying to figure out who will survive the flaming geysers and water walls and plummeting machinery. (Hint Lesser-known names and people of ethnic origin tend to get offed first.)Beyond being a showplace for crash-and-burn effects ""Poseidon"" seems to be stumping for togetherness. The go-it-alone gambler Johns is made to discover that he needs the help of others in order to survive.Now if only the bluebloods and the proles in ""Titanic"" had hooked up that film might have had a happier outcome. Grade B+ Rated PG-13 for intense prolonged sequences of disaster and peril. Next up Independence Day Resurgence Will disaster film become a box office hit?

"Poseidon sinks of its own weight - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Poseidon sinks of its own weight By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  May 11 2006 Is it too soon? Are we ready to probe barely healed wounds and confront intense emotional pain?I refer of course to the opening of a Poseidon Adventure"" remake not five months after Shelley Winterss death in January. Some of us havent even finished sitting shivah. But theres got to be a morning after.Unfortunately Poseidon"" is an ill-fitting tribute to the actress who portrayed Belle Rosen the bubbe with a mean breaststroke in the 1974 original. Back then a disaster movie promised flame-broiled extras and falling structural debris but also schlocky entertainment and B-level stars happily hamboning away. Maybe its the era were living in but the new film is as much fun as a shroud.Its also muscular and convincing -- almost too convincing. In one sequence where the assembled survivors of a flipped cruise ship have to swim 150 yards underwater to safety audiences may find themselves holding their breaths in suspense. A few scenes later as a terrified little boy and his mother blubber what may be their final farewell before rising water drowns the kid those same audiences may question exactly why theyre watching this. If not perhaps they should.You know the drill if not from the original movie (or Paul Gallicos 1969 source novel) then from last years waterlogged TV remake. A massive luxury liner gets hit by a wall of water -- they call them rogue waves"" nowadays -- and does a rollover. The ships captain (Andre Braugher) demands everyone stay in the upside-down ballroom until help arrives which clearly means those who listen to him are doomed. A plucky mixed bag of dissidents strikes out on its own heading upward toward the hull in a bid for rescue.They are Robert Ramsay (Kurt Russell) a former New York mayor and full-time over-protective dad to daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) who is secretly engaged to Christian (Mike Vogel) who seems much too generic to make it to the end credits; Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas) a rambler a gambler and a sweet-talkin ladies man; single mom Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett) and her young son Conor (Jimmy Bennett); ship busboy Marco Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez); Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) a depressed gay architect whose giant zirconium earring outs him from 50 feet away; vulgar jerk Lucky"" Larry (Kevin Dillon); and comely stowaway Elena Gonzalez (Mia Maestro).The problem is that aside from Dillon theres not an over-actor in the bunch. Even the usually reliable Dreyfuss plays it straight you should pardon the expression. Director Wolfgang Petersen who in films like Das Boot"" The Perfect Storm"" and Troy"" hasnt exactly displayed a carefree touch is going for realism here and the initial catastrophe is a special effects jaw-dropper -- the theater feels as if its going over with the ship. The carnage is bone-crushingly frank too and yes this probably is what people look like when theyre being electrocuted. Another movie milestone attained. Once the survivors leave the ballroom though all semblance of plot goes out the porthole and its just up and up water nipping at their heels. In the original Adventure"" the characters stood around every so often and chewed things over but Poseidon"" is structured as a single increasingly panicked chase scene. The new film is actually 20 minutes shorter than the first a disaster movie with attention-deficit disorder.Now obviously some of these folks are going to make it and some arent -- thats the 10-little-Indians guilty pleasure of the genre. An Indian probably wouldnt last too long in Poseidon"" though because the scripts guiding principle seems to be follow the white guy."" Its almost cheering to see a movie toss political correctness to the winds so cavalierly -- and in one scene with such Darwinian brute force -- but it betrays the fundamental democracy of disaster flicks.Indeed part of the enjoyment of The Poseidon Adventure"" was that it let Winterss roly-poly Jewish yenta save the day. In this film the ex-swimming champion is played by Kurt Russell and hes channeling Bruce Willis in Armageddon."" As Belle Rosen might say Fun? Not so much.""A word about Mark Protosevichs screenplay Uninspired. Most of the dialogue occurs in the first half and only a very trusting writer would come up with a line like Conor your friend the Captain wants you to blow the New Years horn"" and not expect the audience to think of Peter Graves in Airplane"" The back half of the movie is all action with characters painting themselves into watery corners and the filmmakers waiting until the grueling last moment before springing the doors open.Thats entertainment? Maybe but it plays with queasy dissonance in a post-9/11 world. There will be people who wont go to United 93"" because they think it will be depressing yet will go to Poseidon"" expecting an exciting night at the movies and I guess I dont understand how their brains work. Maybe the prospect of a second-tier cast dying for the sins of previous bad movies is enough of a camp factor to tilt the scales (although Rossum will have to do hundreds of these to atone for The Phantom of the Opera""). In a world of fresh horror though Poseidon"" seems a strangely punishing form of make-believe.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Poseidon Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/poseidon-2006,200,poseidon18,poseidon,rogerebert
"Poseidon | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; poseidon ) Poseidon (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Irwin Allen would be proud. Poseidon is a throwback - a 1970s-style disaster film made with 2006-era special effects. The movie delivers in most of the ways that matter for a motion picture of this ilk with Poseidon never trying to be something it isnt. Its about a group of two-dimensional humans battling bad luck and Mother Nature in a sea-based disaster that makes Titanic look like a pleasure cruise. Theres enough uncertainty about whos going to live and whos going to die to maintain a bit of suspense until the end although its more a question of mild curiosity than having a vested interest. One smart move by director Wolfgang Petersen and his screenwriter Mark Protosevich is not to attempt to develop the protagonists. Each character in this film represents a tried-and-true disaster film stereotype - from the self-absorbed loner who finds redemption in helping others to the kid who doesnt listen to his mother. The film opens with a few brief scenes that equate each character with their respective type. We are not subjected to the too often obligatory ""character building"" sequences that serve little purpose beyond expanding the running length and providing unintentional humor (see Armageddon Deep Impact The Core etc.). The film is more a re-imagining than a direct remake of the 1972 feature The Poseidon Adventure. Although the premise and basic setup are the same the characters and their specific situations are new. That means no Gene Hackman or Shelly Winters. After a 150-foot high rogue wave capsizes the Poseidon during a New Years cruise a group of survivors struggles to escape from the ship before it sinks. The group is comprised of professional gambler Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas); ex-fireman and ex-mayor of New York City Robert Ramsay (Kurt Russell); single mother Maggie James (Lucinda Barrett) and her son Conor (Jimmy Bennett); Ramsays daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her fiancA(c) Christian (Mike Vogel); depressed businessman Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss); and stowaway Elena (Mia Maestro). Leaving the ""safety"" of the upside-down grand ballroom where most of the survivors huddle behind bulkheads waiting for rescue these men and women face fire water and other perils in their struggle to take control of their own destinies. When one considers a disaster flick there are two aspects of the production that come under scrutiny. The first How spectacular is that actual disaster? The second How many surprises are there in the body count and are the action scenes leading to the deaths convincing and exciting? Although Poseidon doesnt get top grades on either count it does a respectable job in both areas. Some of the victims and survivors are evident from the start but one or two arent obvious. (No director in his right mind would kill a kid or a dog in a disaster film. There are no dogs here but there is a kid.) The biggest special effects moment in the film occurs about 20 minutes in when the huge wave blocks out the moon and horizon before crashing into the ship tilting it over before turning it belly-up. We have seen more impressive disaster spectacles but this one is good enough to be convincing. Its too bad that not all the effects work in the film is this effective. Wolfgang Petersen is no stranger to thrillers at sea - he helmed both Das Boot and A Perfect Storm. In this case his cast has to face not only water but fire as explosions rock different parts of the ship. One can tell from watching Poseidon that this was a physically demanding shoot for the actors. If stunt doubles are used theyre not evident. And many of the most daring feats appear to have been done using a life-sized sound stage rather than through the magic of CGI. That often gives Poseidon a more organic less high-tech feel. In the wake of Titanic theres probably a temptation to turn a sea-disaster picture like Poseidon into en epic romance/adventure. Its a temptation that Petersen thankfully resists. Poseidon is devoid of anything that might conjure up memories of the Winslet/DiCaprio coupling. Its straightforward action/adventure approach is both a strength and a weakness. Petersen sets out to give us a group of undeveloped stock characters and a bunch of cheap thrills and thats what he delivers. If thats the kind of thing you want from a would-be summer blockbuster Poseidon will not disappoint.

The stripped-down title of the disaster epic formerly known as ""The Poseidon Adventure"" accurately reflects the movie itself -- an early-summer vehicle thats built for speed with scant time to develop characters before the world turns upside-down. Thanks to its simple construction Wolfgang Petersens large-scale liner moves reasonably well though anyone with the faintest memory of its 1972 predecessor will wonder where most of the plot went and the dialogue is so stilted it can honestly be said the less the better. Given that Warner Bros. should enjoy a few bright mornings after though prospects of an extended theatrical voyage appear unlikely. Petersen came to prominence directing another sea-faring tale ""Das Boot"" but beyond the waves the two films are polar opposites -- one exploring human nature under claustrophobic conditions the other basically using its actors as props in a video-game style ascent to survival. Its equally telling that when the producers ""started from scratch with an all-new screenplay and original contemporary characters"" as Petersen explains in the production notes the demography of that hardy band changed considerably. And while Richard Dreyfuss plays a gay architect which can be seen as a nod to a new century theres no room anymore for Shelley Winters fat old Mrs. Rosen; instead the three central females -- Jacinda Barrett Emmy Rossum and Mia Maestro -- all look pretty fabulous when wet. Written by Mark Protosevich ""Poseidon"" dispenses with its exposition in the first 20 minutes and even then as sparingly as possible. Dylan (Josh Lucas) is a neer-do-well gambler first seen in a high-stakes poker game opposite Robert (Kurt Russell) who is -- for no particular reason -- the former mayor of New York. Robert is traveling with his headstrong daughter (Rossum) and her boyfriend (Mike Vogel) a relationship Robert isnt thrilled about. Dylan meanwhile engages in a brief flirtation with a single mom (Barrett) who has brought along her young son whereas Elena (Maestro) has stowed away having lacked the passage for a trip to see her ailing brother in New York. Thats about as much as the audience learns before the wave hits leaving the special effects in essence as the star of the story. And while there are some impressive harrowing sequences as passengers get picked off by an almost biblical parade of threats the initial impact of that great ""rogue wave"" is over in a matter of moments and some of the imagery is too conspicuously computer generated diminishing its impact. As the aspiring Moses attempting to lead his people to the promised land (minus the priestly vestments cloaked on Gene Hackman) Lucas cuts a dashing figure and the male bonding between him and Russell brings almost the only sparks that fly character-wise. At least Dreyfuss efforts to assist ""Alias"" co-star Maestro are perfectly chaste in this telling as opposed to Red Buttons dragging a well-soaked Carol Lynley along behind him. From a practical standpoint the movies truncated running time will doubtless come as a pleasant surprise to some not only allowing theaters to squeeze in extra showings but sparing teens the ordeal of sitting through mushy emotion before things start blowing up. And despite the liberties taken this version is preferable to Hallmarks recent made-for-TV update which absurdly revised the story so that terrorists triggered a blast that tipped the boat over. Indeed after a spate of overly long blockbusters from Petersen including ""Troy"" just the fact that he brings one home in less than 100 minutes represents an interesting twist. Still even if the goal was to test whether audiences will warm to a disaster yarn that barely bothers to identify its victims ""Poseidon"" goes a little overboard.
