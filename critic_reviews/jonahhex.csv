Its already sunk in the States but that could have as much to do with the poor quality of the movie as the unfamiliar material. Its the 1870s and Jonah (Josh Brolin) a hideously scarred Civil War veteran is seeking revenge on the Confederate general (John Malkovich) who murdered his family. Oh and for reasons left largely unexplained he can talk to the dead. Its this kind of headscratching development that makes Jonah Hex feel like a film aimed squarely at fans uninitiated viewers will find themselves perplexed and quickly annoyed by the scripts tendency to throw talking corpses mutant cage fighters and mysterious chemical weapons into what might have been a perfectly serviceable action western. At 81 minutes with credits Jonah Hex feels crude lazy and entirely perfunctory.

Pictures and Legendary Pictures in June 2010. (2010) Photo Credit Frank Masi / Warner Bros. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A Western with a supernatural streak and a soundtrack by the hipster metal group Mastodon ""Jonah Hex"" makes for one muddled pop-cultural stew. BOTTOM LINE A Western with a supernatural streak and a soundtrack by the hipster metal group Mastodon ""Jonah Hex"" makes for one muddled pop-cultural stew. CAST Josh Brolin John Malkovich Megan Fox. DIRECTOR Jimmy Hayward LENGTH 121 A Western with a supernatural streak and a soundtrack by the hipster metal group Mastodon ""Jonah Hex"" makes for one muddled pop-cultural stew. And thats not even counting Megan Fox as a prostitute and John Malkovich as an early domestic terrorist. Theres just one ingredient missing anyone with a clue. advertisement | advertise on newsday Thats disappointing since the script comes from Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor two talented genre hacks (thats a compliment) who usually inject smart satire into pulp fare like ""Crank"" and last years underrated ""Gamer."" They also usually direct though in this case they parted with Warner Bros. over ""creative differences."" The Neveldine amp; Taylor touch never exactly light is sorely missed. Whats left is a jumbled story in which the title character (Josh Brolin) a former Confederate soldier with a rope of scar tissue clenching his jaw searches for his disfigurer Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich). While Turnbull builds a nuclear-style doomsday machine like a Reconstruction-era Dr. No Hex tracks him by talking to the dead a trick he learned from some Injuns. Director Jimmy Hayward (""Horton Hears a Who"") ought to find at least some of this funny but instead every scene is rock-video serious. But Hayward also seems busy regluing the pieces of a dropped and shattered project. The fine actor Michael Shannon (""Revolutionary Road"") gets whittled down to a 20-second cameo; Jeffrey Dean Morgan doesnt even get a credit. The film is padded with flashbacks and even re-flashbacks but still falls short of the 90-minute mark. Like it?

Comments click to enlarge Jonah Hex Video Rated PG-13  81 minutes  2010 Jonah Hex the gunslinging antihero introduced by D.C. Comics in 1972 was really just Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name in need of plastic surgery but for this big-screen adaptation screenwriters Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (Crank) have endowed him with the handy ability to interrogate corpses. The result messily directed by Jimmy Hayward begins affably enough as a random slew of Leone-style squint-a-thons and shoot-outs but then loses it way in a dopey anachronism-happy sci-fi plot it seems that Eli Whitney (who died in 1825) built an apocalyptic weapon for the Union during the Civil War and when it falls into the hands of an ex-Confederate terrorist (John Malkovich) President Grant (Aidan Quinn) knows that only Hex (Josh Brolin) can stop him.

Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 18 2010 116AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 18 2010 1221PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Jonah Hex Directed by Jimmy Hayward Written by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor Starring Josh Brolin John Malkovich Megan Fox and Will Arnett Classification PG-13 Calling Jonah Hex a waste of time requires qualification given the action flick weighs in at 82 minutes. And that includes a lengthy comic book prologue and two or three Maxim-style pictorials of star Megan Fox twitching her lips in come-hither poses. The film is based on the popular DC comic franchise the story of a Confederate Civil War veteran (Josh Brolin) who turns to bounty hunting to fill his angry hours after a Mean Evildoer rubs out his family. How despicable is Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich)? Meaner than Johnny Cash without pills - the kind of villain who would stick a branding iron in a mans face just to watch him fry. Thats what Turnbull does to Jonah Hex after murdering his family. Now Jonah roams the western range on a black steed with rat-tat-tatting Gatling guns at his side. The film is a another crudely insistent revenge fantasy - Harry Brown in a cowboy hat. Hex is treated monstrously and so turns into a monster. Filling whole towns full of lead. Shooting hecklers in bars. ""Hey what happened to your face?"" a stranger asks. K-bam k-bam ""Nothing what happened to yours?"" is Hexs deadpan response. All of this - every shootout blown up building-train-bad guy - is perfectly justified. Hex is just getting even after all. It makes sense that the DC comic book was made into a movie. Jonah Hex the comic was inspired by Sergio Leones spaghetti westerns from the 1960s. But whereas Leones films are beautifully arranged landscape studies that provide a Cinemascope high filmmaker Jimmy Haywards ( Horton Hears a Who) work is all about fast-chopped editing. It even scans like a motion comic. Now the beauty of comics - the good ones anyway - is stopping to study the frame and breathe in the atmosphere. Cant do that here. Watching Jonah Hex the movie too often feels like were speed reading cartoon panels. Mind you there isnt much here youd want to slow down for. Co-star Fox who wears a corset and a thin layer of applied sweat still hasnt figured out the difference between posing and acting. And with his every scene Malkovichs purring owl-eyed villain reminds us were watching a really bad movie. The best part of Jonah Hex is Josh Brolin on a horse. Especially when hes not saying anything just moseying into or out of town. Too had he never moseys into a better movie.

Rather than a reinterpretation its a soulless sloppy smirky rerun that makes those Charlies Angels movies seem positively nouvelle vague; at least Drew Barrymore and crew werent just shouting bad impressions over the blasts. Liam Neeson is George Peppard as Hannibal Smith cigar-chomping frontman of the band of wrongly accused Army Rangers; Bradley Cooper is Dirk Benedict as Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck bullets bouncing off his perpetual smug grin; Quinton Jackson is Mr. T as B.A. Baracus whose Mohawk still pities the fool; and District 9s Sharlto Copley is Dwight Schultz as Murdock the howlin mad pilot who crashes most everything he touches. To the mix add in Jessica Biel as the Army captain charged with bringing down the boys (complicated by the fact that Face is her ex); Patrick Wilson as the CIA agent who may or may not be setting up the team (but totally is duh); frequent video-game voice-over actor Brian Bloom as the icky leader of a Blackwater-style operation thats gone rogue I tell ya rogue; and Gerald McRaney as the worlds worst best friend. The plot has something to do with counterfeiting plates but its just an excuse to blow shit up for two hours. How can something this loud be this boring? (Robert Wilonsky) (Citywide) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - GO  8 THE MORMON PROPOSITION Grinning into the camera a young Mormon in a Prop. 8 commercial highlighted in 8 The Mormon Proposition gushes that her activism around getting the ballot measure passed (to restrict the definition of marriage in California to opposite-sex couples) ""makes me feel American."" Diving into the grim irony of one group of Americans denying another group its rights under the guise of upholding American freedoms and ideals director Reed Cowan illuminates how the Mormon Church played California politics like a fiddle and how the churchs homophobia has ruined the lives of its queer faithful. Cowan strikes a potent balance between heart and head juxtaposing emotionally wrenching moments (a segment in which queer Mormons describe past suicide attempts is especially painful) with self-damning portraits of Mormon politicians and church officials and hard-nosed journalism from reporter Fred Karger who exhaustively outlines the churchs role in conceiving and bankrolling Prop. 8. The film whose low budget is underscored in cheesy dramatic reenactments might have been strengthened had Cowan connected dots between the fact that at the same time California passed Prop. 8 Arizona and Florida also passed initiatives banning gay marriage. (He does show how the Mormons used Hawaii as a test run for what theyd achieve in California.) But the flaws pale against whats illustrated which is not just how Prop. 8 passed but also the sordid cynical workings of our political machine. (Ernest Hardy) (Sunset 5)GO  CYRUS This freakishly engrossing black comedy about excessively mothered men and the women who enable them stars John C. Reilly as a middle-aged lost soul who cant believe his luck when he takes up with an enigmatic fox (the excellent Marisa Tomei). Until that is he runs afoul of her son the emotional terrorist played by Jonah Hill who cannily dials down the schoolboy hysteria that has defined his persona in the Judd Apatow oeuvre into a lethally seditious calm. So begins a slow war of attrition as excruciatingly funny to watch as it is horrifying to be caught up in. Yet nothing is overplayed in a movie that wanders teasingly along the borders between sorrow and laughter. Directed by Jay and Mark Duplass who come loosely associated with the mumblecore movement Cyrus was made with Hollywood money (Ridley and Tony Scott neither famous for the experimental method are executive producers) and big-name stars. It still retains the meandering quality of the Duplass brothers The Puffy Chair but also has a satisfying formal coherence. How you read the ending of this wickedly ambiguous yet strangely tender parsing of modern relationships will depend to a degree on which genre you think the film falls into but far more on whether you think theres such a thing in this age of perpetual youth as a grown-up. (Ella Taylor) (t/k)GO  ANTON CHEKHOVS THE DUEL Faithfully adapted from the Chekhov novella by Mary Bing and crisply paced by Israeli director Dover Koshashvili Anton Chekhovs The Duel comes about as close to soap opera passion as the virtuoso of wistful lethargy is likely to get. Perhaps comic opera is the operative term Adultery betrayal blackmail drunken antics and all manner of peculiar impulse behavior enliven the summery indolence of a Black Sea backwater. Laevsky (Andrew Scott) an agitated intellectual young wastrel is frantically attempting to ditch Nadia (Fiona Glascott) the vain lazily bovine married woman whom he persuaded to run away with to the wilds of the Caucasus. Laevsky and Nadia are perfectly ill-matched in their respective inability to cope with crisis. As the discarded mistress becomes increasingly lost her disheveled lover grows hysterically dissolute. Meanwhile their tragicomic floundering is observed by three professionals -- a contemptuous zoologist with a particular animus for Laevsky; the kindly if dim-witted town doctor; and a timid deacon -- each of whom embodies a particular moral position. The largely verbal drama is played out over a series of comic social disasters to climax with the eponymous affaire dhonneur -- at once the height of irrationality and the logical culmination of the movies ongoing narrative argument. Although co-producer Donald Rosenfeld is a longtime Merchant Ivory associate this potentially middlebrow exercise is neither anemic nor unduly genteel. The period atmosphere is sensuous; the postcard setting feels lived-in. The Duel is the most successful literary adaptation Ive seen since Pascal Ferrans 2006 Lady Chatterley. (J.

Sep. 13 600pm GO  I AM LOVE As unrepentantly grandiose and ludicrous as its title Luca Guadagninos visually ravishing third feature suggests an epic that Visconti and Sirk might have made after they finished watching Vertigo and reading Madame Bovary while gorging themselves on aphrodisiacs. That it works so well -- despite frequently risible dialogue (""Happy is a word that makes one sad"") and a notion of feminism that carbon-dates around the time Kate Chopin published The Awakening -- is a testament to the films loony sincerity and seductive voluptuousness. Guadagninos ""social melodrama"" is anchored by the magnificence of Tilda Swinton who plays Emma Recchi the unhappy unfulfilled Russian wife of a Milanese industrialist and mother of three adult children; her carnal desires surface after her sons friend Antonio (Edoardo Gabbriellini) prepares her a plate of perfectly seasoned shrimp. Theres nothing especially novel of course about exploring the soul-crushing emptiness of marriage to a titan of industry. But I Am Love may be the first film in which the lonely heroine finds inspiration in her daughters lesberation. For all its corny social studies I Am Love never forgets the lust that drives its narrative. Swinton and Gabbriellini make an extremely foxy couple her translucent flesh complemented by his dark hair and beard. Their assignations are all action little talk; when Guadagnino focuses solely on the primal the effect is spellbinding. Only the words get in the way. (Melissa Anderson) (Arclight Hollywood Landmark Playhouse Town Center)JONAH HEX Bracingly inept Chef Boyardee spaghetti Western Jonah Hex is the rare 80-minute movie that you cant even call ""taut."" Rather than teasing out curiosity about its outcast heros past Jonah pelts the viewer with clumps of exposition including a hasty comic-book-graphic origin montage illustrating the strange case of Hex (Josh Brolin) a former Confederate war machine whose near-death experience gave him the ability to talk to the departed -- hardly utilized or meaningful given the movies fatuous killing. We catch up with Hex roaming the steampunk Wild (Wild) West now a heavy-ordinance bounty hunter with his face half-melted into a permanent growl a reminder of the former commanding officer Turnbull who destroyed his life (played by John Malkovich pulling his purring villain off the shelf). Its 1876 and guess-who is plotting to construct a sort-of Doomsday Merrimack to sail into the Chesapeake Bay and level Washington D.C. for President Grants July 4th centenary address. Grudgingly tapped to save the Union Jonah gets help from strategic Black Friend gadgeteer Lance Reddick and strumpet gal pal Megan Fox who looks like shes waiting for the invention of clear heels. Metal outfit Mastodons sound track riffs never lock down a groove with the image interesting actors flit by barely used and franchise ambitions quietly expire. (Nick Pinkerton) (Citywide)GO  THE LOTTERY The ginger stepchild of President Obamas election platform it seems that this countrys broke-ass education system is finally stepping up for its media moment. On the heels of a recent 60 Minutes piece on the SEED school in Washington D.C. and New York Times Magazine cover story focused on education reform comes The Lottery a precise impassioned look at the battle between zone and charter schools in Harlem. Director Madeleine Sackler interweaves the stories of four charter hopefuls and their families with an exploration of an issue whose politics have grown so complex that they squiggle even partisan lines. Sackler finds personal persuasive points of entry for key factors in the debate Statistics contrasting the annual amounts spent on a childs education and a prisoners housing are followed by the account of a school lottery entrants incarcerated father who laments his lack of choice as much as the choices he made. An electrifying community meeting finds Harlem Success president Eva Moskowitz both vilified and heralded as ""our Obama"" by local parents as the unions depend on such poorly understood class and neighborhood tensions to maintain the status quo. Sackler reframes education reform as a moral issue and its impossible to look at the fallen faces of kids turned away from a school -- of all things -- and disagree. (Michelle Orange) (Music Hall) RAVAAN was not screened in advance of our deadline but a review will appear here next week.STONEWALL UPRISING In the early-morning hours of Saturday June 28 1969 at a dive on 53 Christopher Street in New York City the homosexual intifada began -- an event that remains surprisingly underdocumented. Homo history is bifurcated pre- and post-June 69 evident in the titles of the documentaries Before Stonewall (1984) and After Stonewall (1999). The value of Kate Davis and David Heilbroners poorly structured doc Stonewall Uprising is that it focuses on the during assembling minute-by-minute recapitulations of those who were there. Their memories are undeniably powerful their fury still white-hot 41 years later ""Our goal was to hurt the police. I wanted to kill those cops"" remembers John OBrien one man on the front lines. The inclusion of some talking heads however remains highly questionable For a film that celebrates the courage of the long-marginalized who fought back who ushered in the whole concept of gay pride is Ed Koch really someone you want to talk to? And tellingly its not the queers but a cop -- Seymour Pine the 90-year-old retired NYPD morals inspector who led the raid on the Stonewall Inn -- who gets the last word. (Melissa Anderson) (Nuart)GO  TOY STORY 3 Fifteen years after ushering in a new era of CGI animation and 11 years after a colossally successful pre-millennial sequel the Toy Story franchise returns to a changed world. Its irresistible conceit and snappy good humor remain largely intact though now it also hauls a saltier and more anxious sensibility. Inanimate figurines dont age but they do get nicked up and discarded and that tension between immortality and irrelevance remains the central conflict in Lee Unkrichs Toy Story 3. Andy is all grown up and about to drive off to college leaving the fate of his toys uncertain. Will they be stored in the attic left on the curb for sanitation pickup or delivered to the local day-care center? All of the above it turns out as the whole gang gets caught in an odyssey of compounded indignities. Fears of the unknown of neglect and abuse are gradually eclipsed by the threat of disposal. Identifying with plastic figures has always been essential to the series playfully perverse aptly adolescent allure but here that empathy mutates into macabre existentialist dread. How many kids movies lead their protagonists to the precipice of a flaming pit of hell? (Eric Hynes) (Citywide)WAH DO DEM A couple days before cashing in on a free Caribbean cruise for two dorky Brooklyn hipster Max (Sean Bones) is dumped by his girlfriend (Norah Jones in a tiny cameo) -- perhaps because he has no personality and his mouth hangs open like half an idiot -- but takes the trip alone anyway. Strutting around the ships senior citizens in a daze he barely talks to anyone and eventually docks in Jamaica where he naively gets in a car with the first stranger who smokes weed. Through a series of increasingly dumb-ass decisions Max loses his money passport clothes and his boat ride back home. Meanwhile TVs and newspapers in the background hint that Obama is about to win the U.S. presidency but our superficial hero cant be bothered to notice in filmmakers Ben Chace and Sam Fleischners glorified vacation video. The two wrote this slight handheld-shot drama around a free cruise Ben won then upped their indie cred with supporting players from Yeasayer MGMT Suckers and the Congos. If Max had been knifed to death for his oblivious behavior (the threat does exist) the film mightve been a critique of ugly Americans embarrassing themselves to indigenous folks but methinks were meant to actually feel sorry for this privileged twerp in neon sunglasses.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Jonah Hex Western horror. Starring Josh Brolin John Malkovich and Megan Fox. Directed by Jimmy Hayward. (PG-13. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""This heres my story"" says Jonah Hex the ax-wielding corpse-whispering hideously scarred 19th century Western-style bounty hunter at the outset of the film that bears his name. Thing is it isnt much of a story. Sure its got a hero on an errand of vengeance (Josh Brolin) a hooker with a heart of gold (Megan Fox corseted to within an inch of her life) an incompetent Irish thug with chin tattoos (Michael Fassbender) and a wacky genocidal villain (John Malkovich) who plans to kill Jonah and most important destroy the U.S. government with translucent orange bocce balls. Or something. It also has several actors with really bad quasi-Southern accents. Oh and fire - lots and lots of fire. Explosions too. Stuff blows up and I mean constantly; seven scenes (I counted) climax in flames. Unrepentant pyromaniacs might have a good time. Fans of the selfsame D.C. Comics series should enjoy Brolins rasping masculine approach to the mystically gifted Jonah whose key superpower is the ability to temporarily rouse dead folk for a chat. The villainous Quentin Turnbull is played by Malkovich outfitted with Snidely Whiplash grins and something that looks like a David Crosby wig. Hes one of several actors who utter inane gobs of dialogue thats either intentionally funny or unintentionally painful hard to tell which. Aidan Quinn as President Ulysses S. Grant gets the worst of it though Brolin is additionally hampered by a stiff prosthetic kisser that turns every sibilant into mush (""Wheresh Turnbull?""). Visually ""Jonah Hex"" is an orgy of overstatement rapid edits garish colors harsh light. In an effort to vary the tone director Jimmy Hayward an animator who co-directed the mostly adorable ""Horton Hears a Who"" inserts overexposed fantasy scenes featuring dirt the color of those nation-killing bocce balls. Truth be told the best part of the film unspools early on in a bit of cartoon backstory thats rendered with the slashing kinetic imagery of comic-book art. I wanted to see that movie the animated one or at least a live-action version intercut with a few interesting hand-drawn passages. Loath as I am to complain about a short running time I think ""Jonah Hex"" could have exceeded 80 minutes to make room for some real visual invention. And three-dimensional characters. And a plot. A plot would have been nice. -- Advisory intense sequences of violence and action disturbing images and sexual content.

Its as if the filmmakers used screenplay-generator software to devise this comic-book action movie. They entered in a few plot points - post-Civil War America badly scarred bounty hunter charismatic cult-leader villain and superweapon - pushed a button and out came this movie.Josh Brolin stars and in the films back-story prologue we learn how he came to be Jonah Hex a Confederate soldier who chose honor over comrades and paid dearly for the choice. He killed his best friend who just happened to be the son of the crazed Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich). Turnbull returns the favor by killing Jonahs wife and son and brands his face with a QT. Lest anyone mistake him for an overzealous Quentin Tarantino fan Jonah takes a red-hot hatchet to his face to obscure Turnbulls brand leaving him with the most distractingly improbable scar in movie makeup history.A lot of comic-lore mumbo jumbo is thrown out by Jonah in his grim-voiced narration. Such as He was left for dead saved by a band of Crows (the Indian tribe not the birds) and as a result he now shares a spiritual bond with crows (the birds not the Indian tribe) and can speak to the dead. He does this by touching the dead and reviving them in a way that will be very (very) familiar to fans of the dear departed TV series Pushing Daisies. Movie Information Jonah HexRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Jimmy HaywardStarring Josh Brolin John Malkovich Megan FoxRun time 81 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (intense violence sexual situations)Synopsis Megan Fox puts on a corset for this supernatural Western based on a comic book. Josh Brolin stars as the titles bounty hunter.More movies from GuideLive.comPresumably this all makes sense to fans of the Jonah Hex comic book series but as relayed to the big screen its all just so much portentous piffle. Jonah lives for revenge but he thinks Turnbull is dead so he becomes a bounty hunter with high-tech weapons and an uncanny knack for dodging bullets and not dying.Of course Turnbull is still alive and plotting to destroy America with a superweapon called the ""nation killer."" Its all extremely silly but played dead straight. On the heels of The A-Team heres another over-the-top action movie that tries to weave some real-life parallels into its mayhem. So Malkovichs quietly sadistic madman is called ""Terroriste"" and distinguished by his ""willingness to strike civilian targets."" Sigh.Brolin hampered by the architecture of his silly-putty facial scar speaks without moving his mouth. Malkovich looks soft and bored in ways that dont seem entirely intentional. Megan Fox portrays Jonahs prostitute girlfriend and as such gets to play with guns and sport a corset so tightly bound she looks like a red-satin-encased hourglass - not a good look by the way.Not that Jonah Hex would be mistaken as a great movie anyway but it is further compromised by the bad-luck timing of coming out in the wake of the release of the video game Red Dead Redemption from Rockstar the creators of among others the Grand Theft Auto franchise. In their Old West settings and themes of the mindlessness of violence the corruption of power and the fine line between good and evil these two projects share a lot of conceptual DNA. In every way that movies are supposed to trump video games - character story dialogue -Red Dead Redemption leaves Jonah Hex in the dust.

Frank Masi/Warner Bros./AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If summer franchise movies continue to recycle comic books will comic books eventually disappear? Or will movies? Or will they both sail off together? Such were my thoughts while watching ""Jonah Hex"" based on the DC comics series featuring the post-Civil War era drifter and bounty hunter (Josh Brolin) whose face - half of it anyway - was hideously scarred by his mortal enemy (John Malkovich who has a patent on playing mortal enemies).Actually its hard to have any thoughts while watching ""Jonah Hex"" - the cranium-crushing soundtrack takes care of that. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Brolin manages to come through with a star turn even though he resembles walking beefsteak tartare. Megan Fox inevitably turns up as a whore with a heart of fools gold and Aidan Quinn in a prime piece of miscasting is President Ulysses S. Grant. (No cigar-chomping here. Is he wearing a nicotine patch?) Other well-known actors are credited notably Michael Shannon who barely gets a walk-on. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? No doubt he was left on the cutting-room floor. As much as I like Shannon Im not complaining. ""Jonah Hex"" directed by Jimmy (""Horton Hears A Who"") Hayward has a running time of about 80 minutes. Thats just about right. Completists will have to wait for the DVD directors cut. Im no completist.

"Jonah Hex | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jonah-hex ) Jonah Hex (United States 2010) June 17 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli With its skinny running length (80 minutes including credits) often incoherent narrative and neutered violence Jonah Hex shows all the signs of having been re-worked in the editing room. The resultant production as is often the case in situations like this would be better off going straight-to-video. And if this represents the true vision of director Jimmy Hayward (Horton Hears a Who) then I have only one question What was he thinking? Jonah Hex is short enough slick enough and loud enough to avoid being summarily dismissed. Although the storyline with its bizarre ventures into mysticism and necromancy is at times difficult to follow (at least for someone not conversant with the comic book source material) the movie is never boring. It is however frustrating. The lead character Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is a Civil War-era vigilante with a thirst for blood and death-dealing. Yet obsessed by the desire to release this with a PG-13 rating Warner Brothers has sanitized an avalanche of gruesome killings beyond whats reasonable. So despite the high body count theres almost no viscera. Defending the decision to circumvent the R-rating is fruitless especially considering that the PG-13 restrictions are more distracting than effective. I mean if a movie is about a stone-cold killer shouldnt it be honest enough to show his work? The movie transpires in the post-Civil War era with two ex-Confederate soldiers squaring off against one another. On one side is the twisted General Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) who is assembling a doomsday weapon that he intends to turn against Washington D.C. and use to end the presidency of U.S. Grant (Aidan Quinn). On the other side is Jonah Hex the scarred bounty hunter and ex-subordinate of Turnbulls whose face bears the marks of a brand wielded by the General on the night he killed Hexs wife and son. Hex is not an ordinary man either. Rescued from death by Indian magic hes almost impossible to kill and he possesses the ability to speak with the dead. Hexs lone weakness is a prostitute named Lilah (Megan Fox) who pines for him while entertaining clients. Before he can offer Lilah a better life however Hex must settle his score with Turnbull and his sadistic sidekick Burke (Michael Fassbender). Most of Jonah Hex follows Hex who bears a passing resemblance to something out of one of George Romeros ""Dead"" movies as he kills people (all of which deserve their fates). Most of them are related to Turnbull in one way or another. There are scenes that take place in some sort of parallel mystical arena - a one-on-one affair that transpires on red sand and reflects the situation in the ""real"" world. The specifics of this are never made clear although perhaps this is second-nature stuff to Jonah Hex fans. The best thing that can be said about Jonah Hex is that it has the good sense not to take itself too seriously (theres a fun scene in which Hex pulls out some serious gunfighting hardware thats a few decades ahead of its time); the tongue isnt always planted in the cheek but its there often enough. Josh Brolin does a game job growling his way through the part and generally looks like a badass under a lot of latex. He is often upstaged by the nicely staged visual setups and the loud metal music but thats what he signed on for and he delivers the requisite one-liners with aplomb. Hes also not as enjoyable as John Malkovich who lives by the rulebook for overplaying the bad guy. Its always a problem when the villain is more interesting and charismatic than the hero. Megan Fox is on hand to provide eye candy. She has no character to speak of and her screening time is so limited that it wouldnt have been hard to eliminate her except then the movie would have been short its token corseted brunette. The part suits the level of acting talent she has thus far exhibited. Its hard to fault the idea behind Jonah Hex - the concept of an 1870s vigilante is pregnant with potential but the execution is awful. Without an understanding of what occurred behind-the-scenes its impossible to know who to blame for the final result but something this messy should have been cleaned up before reaching the screen. Jonah Hex like so many DC Comics properties not featuring Batman or Superman fails a successful transition from the printed page to the big screen.

Starring Josh Brolin John Malkovich Megan Fox Will Arnett Michael Shannon Director Jimmy Hayward Release Opened Jun 18 2010  Editorial Review Not much more than an ugly faceBy Michael OSullivanFriday June 18 2010""Jonah Hex"" may not be the longest 81 minutes you ever spend but it might well be the most tedious. Inspired by the comic-book cowboy character of the same name -- a scar-faced Civil War-era bounty hunter who can commune with the dead and who seems impervious to bullets himself -- the movie plods forward one leaden step at a time in single-minded pursuit of a goal.No not brains as in some zombie movies.Theres precious little of that commodity here under the serviceable but uninspired direction of Jimmy Hayward making his live-action debut after ""Horton Hears a Who."" Instead Hex (Josh Brolin) is driven by revenge. Revenge for his slain wife and child who were murdered by a demented Confederate officer named Turnbull (John Malkovich in full snake mode). In a prologue we learn that they were killed as punishment for the death of Turnbulls son (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) at Hexs hands.Will Hex catch Turnbull? And will he be able to stop him in his fiendish plan to attack Washington with a secret and wildly implausible super-weapon?Who cares.There are diversions along the way. Megan Fox is one. As the prostitute Lilah and Hexs love interest Fox the buxom hottie of ""Transformers"" fame will appeal to the same lad-mag crowd that ""Jonah Hexs"" crunching hard-rock score does.Michael Fassbender (""Inglourious Basterds"") makes an interesting-enough villain as Turnbulls tattooed Irish henchman Burke. Though truth be told his fights with Hex only serve to prolong the story unnecessarily.As for the title character Brolin has a suitably embittered hard-boiled presence. Most of his acting however is done by his facial prosthesis a gruesome-looking hole in his right cheek courtesy of Turnbull that has left him with a mouth that doesnt quite work. No matter. Theres nothing of particular importance in the dialogue which largely consists of such schoolyard taunts as ""Is that all youve got?""Of course theres plenty of shooting if you like that sort of thing including from Hexs horse-mounted twin Gatling guns which are kind of cool. But the way Hex can resurrect a corpse simply by touching it to perform a bit of postmortem interrogation is the films most original touch.Would that he could accomplish that same miracle with the film. Like Hex himself the movie may not exactly be dead but it sure as heck aint living.Contains frequent violence and brief sensuality.

Jonah Hex is one rugged slice of hombre served up extra-ornery. Among the several reasons why hes miffed as he wanders a cursed landscape in the post-Civil War South Jonah (Josh Brolin) was forced to kill his best friend rather than torch a hospital; his buddys father and his former commanding officer (John Malkovich) killed Jonahs wife and kids while making Jonah watch from a crucifixion position; half his face was burned off when his C.O. mashed it with a branding iron; and his girlfriend (Megan Fox) is a hooker whose clients dont treat her very nicely. On the plus side being kinda slightly dead himself from all this mistreatment means Jonah can talk to dead people for a little while at least until their flesh starts to get singed and they beg to be allowed to relax in their graves. As befits its surly hero ""Jonah Hex"" is a problem movie a little too arty and abstract to be sold as an actioner too self-consciously pulpy for the art house too weird and disturbing to market as yet another comic book movie (although it is one). Warner Brothers is dumping it without fanfare having first taken care (or so it appears) to gouge and hack it down to 82 fleeting minutes. Critics are likely to scoff. But theres a colorful damnation lurking in the movies haunted soul. With its cast of raging rogues and its scorched surreal atmosphere it occupies a space somewhere between ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (though I dont claim this film is equal to those two classics). Jonah roams a period that isnt often well-evoked -- 1876 when the self-brutalized nation lay feverish and trembling under a slowly dissipating fog bank of death. The Western with its code of short tempers and cheap life sprang from the Civil War but few Westerns connect the dots to demonstrate how the war must have created hollow nihilists the way ""Jonah Hex"" does. Jonah joined the Confederate Army not for ideology but for the rebellion and a taste for war. (The film somewhat awkwardly provides him with a black friend to prove hes no racist.) But when his commander turned from soldier to terrorist and ordered attacks on civilians Jonah refused to take the path of dishonor. Now his commander is planning to smite the Union with secret super-weapons stolen from the US military. That these bombs are groovy- looking lava-lamp-ish orange balls you might expect college students to stare at while listening to Jefferson Airplane somewhat lessens their dramatic impact. That sort of gadgetry (which also includes pocket-size crossbows) combined with Jonah being hired by President Ulysses Grant (Aidan Quinn) gives the film a touch of ""Wild Wild West."" But unlike that big- screen flop ""Jonah Hex"" doesnt veer into capering silliness although it does have a tongue-in-cheek wit. Tying up his horse and leaving it in the care of a small boy Jonah is asked the animals name. ""Horse"" he growls. Thats a line Clint Eastwood might have used with similar effect in The Man With No Name trilogy and Brolin is a worthy successor to the master. The movie around him is a study in dread -- savage mournful scarred by strange portents. Recurring images of a raven perched on a coffin indicate Jonahs likely fate and a temporary defeat of death is signified by the same black bird flying out of Jonahs mouth. Nutty? Maybe. But a pungent blast of the cinema du bonkers is just what this summers multiplexes need after weeks of bromide-stuffed retreads that are as smug about their lack of originality as packs of teen girls who dress exactly alike. Mock ""Jonah Hex"" if you must but you cant say youve seen a lot of other supernatural Westerns lately. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Billboard Say Say Say most popular Jackson song Read Next Billboard Say Say Say most popular Jackson song Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 34774 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21861 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 18027 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Warner Bros.) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 17 2010 504 PM Title Jonah Hex The gritty Western ""Jonah Hex"" is adapted from a series of graphic novels but with its impassive hunt-and-shoot attitude it might as well be based on a video game.Fans of the titular comic-book character will find their complex anti-hero turned into a brooding killing machine whose intricate back story is mostly irrelevant. What matters here are quick explosive thrills and in that regard alone director Jimmy Hayward delivers.Bounty hunter Hex (Josh Brolin) was once a Confederate soldier who earned the eternal fury of his commanding officer Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) by killing Turnbulls son in self-defense. A vengeful sociopath Turnbull responded with an attack that left Hex both physically and emotionally disfigured.When President Grant (Aidan Quinn) and his top aide (Will Arnett) hear Turnbull is planning a massive assault on innocent citizens they ask Hex to destroy his old enemy. With help from his favorite courtesan (a blank Megan Fox) Hex is happy to oblige.Brolin gets to play with some impressive artillery and there are enough shootouts and fights to connect the weak story line.Hayward and screenwriters Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor toss in anything they think might look cool (modern weaponry supernatural scares) and throw out anything that gets in the way (plot characterization logic). And though Brolin is always watchable all the actors appear well aware that theyre slumming.If all you want is a bullets-and-bombs B-movie youll get your moneys worth Somehow Hayward makes 82 minutes feel like hours.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie Review Jonah Hex - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie Review Jonah HexMyth and reality collide in a hot mess in DC Comics Old West tale of a scarred bounty hunter bent on revenge.June 18 2010|Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic There are few truths to be found in the smoldering ash heap that is ""Jonah Hex"" but here are the ones that matter John Malkovich is responsible for the Fourth of July fireworks tradition (who knew?); Megan Fox looks better fighting in a bustier than tight white ""Transformers"" jeans (no-brainer); definitely consider a cosmetic surgeon to deal with those unsightly facial scars dont get in a pique and try to do it yourself (duh). This latest DC Comics transmogrification into mega-action mess stars Josh Brolin as Jonah a bounty-hunting latter-day saint with an ax to grind and a face that even a mother couldnt love (see cosmetic surgery tip above). The film is director Jimmy Haywards ("" Horton Hears a Who"") first go at live action and there is promise in all the fire and brimstone raining down just no soul in the souls the devil went down to Georgia for. Set in the aftermath of the Civil War ""Jonah Hex"" is an apocalypse story of betrayal and redemption that burns its way through D.C. the Deep South and the dusty West. The till-death-do-they-part battle between good and evil pits a renegade Confederate colonel named Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich) against a vengeance-hungry Jonah. At stake is more than old grudges a the very future of these newly united states hangs in the balance. Basically Jonah shot Turnbulls son and some other Confederates who started blowing up civilians rather than Union soldiers. Not one to turn the other cheek Turnbull murdered Jonahs family and seared his QT brand into Jonahs face as a reminder that he ""destroyed everything you ever loved"" or something like that. Its not easy to forget the sentiment since Malkovich delivers the line so many times you wonder if he just never got the script revisions. Ah the ""script."" Writers Neveldine amp; Taylor who I gather arent using their first names to protect the familys rep have found a way to turn biblical references into bad dialogue at head-turning speed while making 83 minutes feel like a lifetime. I guess with ""Crank"" and ""Crank High Voltage"" as a training ground it was to be expected. In the comic book tradition the story weaves between the real and the mythical but its a very boozy trip. Brolins intermittent voice-over narration proves to be the most powerful stuff with the rest curiously sputtering. Case in point Jonahs caustic one-liners fall dead because their target has already bitten the dust a its just no fun if you cant see the guy react to being dissed before hes deceased. The look of the film is great though visually there are three distinctive streams that Hayward has trouble meshing. There is the stark graphic comic book style that is used to good effect in the beginning when Jonah is filling us in on why hes so mad. The style that dominates the film is a sort of spaghetti western wrapped in worn leather and dusted by grime that is by far the best; and finally a surreal-scape of dry red river beds and scary dreams which look evocative but are just not right for this movie. Of course the biggest effect is Jonahs face with half of it Brolins ruggedly handsome scruff the other a swirling crater of skin with a hole that exposes very bad dental hygiene. I guess its a good thing that Foxs Lilah a sharp-shooting hooker with a crush on Hex didnt find it as distracting as I did or some of the fights would have gone on even longer. Malkovich who does malevolence so well is strangely flat as the villain. All would be lost without his No. 2 the devilish Michael Fassbender as a tattooed crazy Brit named Burke. He takes care of most of the hand-to-hand combat with Jonah and brings the fire needed to fuel the bad guys and inflame his adversaries. That is not an inconsequential skill since he who controls the fire controls the action in ""Jonah Hex."" Cities burn people burn circuses burn boats burn. The governments secret new weapon of mass destruction that Turnball has stolen and Jonah has been conscripted to recover is a molten sphere that turns ordinary cannonballs into great balls of fire. But this is one film even Jerry Lee Lewis couldnt save. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Red TailsJanuary 20 2012Movie Review ThorMay 6 2011Critics Notebook The dilution of Comic-ConJuly 18 2010Toy Story 3 appears blessed Jonah Hex cursedJune 18 2010MOVIE REVIEW  Death Wish Enters Comic-Book PhaseNovember 9 1987MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmJohn MalkovichCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-jonah-hex-20100618,0,2037457.story",200,jonahhex15,jonahhex,latimes

If you ever wondered just how desperate Hollywood is to find the next big summer franchise -- and how clueless they are about how to do it -- take a look at the recipe for ""Jonah Hex."" First buy up the rights to a comic book ""legend"" which is really anything but. Second get the folks who made films like ""Crank High Voltage"" and ""Bullethead"" to write it. Finally hand it off to a director whose only previous feature was a Dr. Seuss cartoon. Really somebody thought this sounded like a plan?Jonah Hex(PG-13) Warner Bros. (81 min.) Directed by Jimmy Hayward. With Josh Brolin Megan Fox John Malkovich. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating One star Ratings note The film contains violence and sensuality.A dogs breakfast of half-remembered spaghetti Westerns and the leftovers of ""Wild Wild West"" the film stars Josh Brolin as a Confederate soldier out for vengeance against the one-time comrade who killed his family. President Ulysses S. Grant makes a guest appearance too as does Megan Foxs cleavage. Common sense though is far harder to locate. Right from the start Brolins Jonah Hex is a pretty peculiar Johnny Reb. You see he joined the Confederacy not because he hated the Union or loved slavery but just  ""didnt like being told what to do"" by Washington. Hes you know kind of a small-government Stars-and-Bars guy. Sure. He must be pretty progressive though because his armaments expert is a former slave. Medical care meanwhile comes courtesy of Native Americans who take Hex in after he gets a shotgun blast to the chest mumble some prayers and dose him with hallucinogens. Hex repays them by vomiting up a live crow. Where this script came from though is anyones guess. His mouth in a perpetual sneer from his characters scars -- at least I think thats why hes sneering -- Brolin strides around talking to the dead and destroying things mostly the good will he garnered after surprising everyone with ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""W."" John Malkovich turns in another one of his catalog-order epicene villains. Fox simply displays her curves -- even her eyelashes are voluptuous -- as well as her incredible bad taste in parts as Hexs cathouse girlfriend. (At least Salma Hayek playing a similar role in ""Wild Wild West"" was in on the joke.) None of it makes too much sense although to be fair it might have once -- getting a PG-13 rating instead of an R for this violent actioner was reportedly a drawn-out process. You can tell. The occasionally odd editing and the dont-blink appearance of a number of actors (Will Arnett Michael Shannon) hint at censored details and missing scenes. The arty padding (flashbacks hallucinations and finally flashbacks within hallucinations) suggest a desperate editing-room attempt to make it all work. They should have just cut another 81 minutes.

The sight is quite the conversation starter How the heck did Hex (Josh Brolin) get so ugly? Trouble is folksll get to dozing off as the movie answers the question with exactly the kind of nerdy eye-crossing attention to arbitrary character traits and unlikely relationships that sucks the cinematic air out of so many comic-book movies. Turns out Hex a 19th-century bounty hunter suffering from Civil War PTS in a wardrobe purchased at the High Plains Drifter Club For Men was mutilated by Confederate baddie Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich sneering and lolling as he adds to his character list of psycho-crazies). Turnbull also murdered Hexs family because Hex accidentally killed Turnbulls own son. Who dont you know was also Hexs good friend. Now Hex wants revenge. Which suits President Ulysses S. Grant (Aidan Quinn) since Turnbull has become an anti-Union terrorist. But which bothers Hexs loyal lady friend Lilah (Megan Fox) a prostitute who clearly enjoys good skin care treatment in the neighborhood of her brothel. None of em merit a fiddle-dee-dee. Among Hexs talents are the ability to raise a dead man from his grave long enough to have a chat and the good manners to talk nicely to his horse. Brolin discharges his comic-book duties manfully (if by manful you mean with a perpetual squint growl scar-tissued sneer and a tendency to peer out below the brim of his hat like a cowboy Princess Di).

Jonah Hex That bombing sound could be Foxs career | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJonah Hex That bombing sound could be Foxs careerJonah Hex brings comic book story to the big screen.Megan Fox stars in Jonah Hex.  (handout / handout)  John Malkovich left stars as Quentin Turnbull and Wes Bentley plays Adelman Lusk in Jonah Hex.  (handout / handout)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 18 2010Jonah Hex(out of 4)Starring Josh Brolin John Malkovich Megan Fox Michael Fassbender and Wes Bentley. Directed by Jimmy Hayward. 81 minutes. At major theatres. 14ALots of things go ka-boom and rat-a-tat-tat in Jonah Hex a barrel-scraping attempt at another comic book movie franchise.But the most interesting sound is the steady tick-tick-tick of the clock winding down on Megan Foxs 15 minutes of fame.Article Continued BelowAfter burning her bridges with Transformers and bombing with Jennifers Body this was supposed to be the summer blockbuster that restored her to the big screen and the hearts of fanboys.No such luck in this artlessly directed and sloppily written production which has been slipped into theatres without benefit of a proper critical preview -- and its easy to see why.Jimmy Hayward directs the title anti-hero drawn from the DC Comics series of the same name who is played with neither humour nor flair by Josh Brolin. Hell not look back fondly on this role.Hex is a bounty hunter and former Confederate Army soldier condemned by dark magic to exist in an other-world between life and death.He has semi-supernatural powers conferred by a sympathetic Indian shaman but also a fearsome machine gun.Hexs face was gruesomely disfigured by the same man who killed his family and caused his ghostly misery terrorist Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich). Hexs only earthly friend is Lilah (Megan Fox) a hooker with a heart of gold and her own basket of pain. Too bad she doesnt also have much of an actress to play her but then nobody in this film comes out smelling like roses.Hex wants nothing to do with normal society or politics yet hes summoned by the U.S. president to help save his still-young country.Seems the odious Turnbull played by Malkovich in full shrubbery- chewing mode has managed to cheat death himself.Hes somehow managed to acquire a weapon of mass destruction that looks a lot like an atomic bomb.The movie may be set in the 1870s the years immediately following the Civil War but the parallels with todays terrorism battles are driven home like a tomahawk through the skull.This looked to be a priority project by Warner Bros. at one point -- that is until the cash spigot got turned off. The special effects are really cheesy even by comic-book standards.The running time has been cut to a savage 81 minutes suggesting serious editing but it still feels long.Youd have think theyd had learned from the spectacular failure of Wild Wild West a decade or so ago.But you know what it is about hexes; theyre awfully hard to remove once acquired and Jonah Hex seems well and truly cursed.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Pictures A snag in the plan Lilah (Megan Fox) helps Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) in his fight against enemy Quentin Turnbull. ABOUT THE MOVIEJonah Hex 1/2 (out of four)Stars Josh Brolin John Malkovich Megan Fox Will Arnett Aidan QuinnDirector Jimmy HaywardDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action disturbing images and sexual content.Running time 1 hour and 27 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Some movies seem so blatant an effort to appeal to a specific target audience that they ought to come with a viewers advisory warning. The opening frame of Jonah Hex should say ""Caution Made expressly for the male teen demographic. Not suitable for anyone of any age who prefers movies with coherence an original plot or characters they give a hoot about."" Based on a series from DC Comics Jonah Hex is about a gunslinging loner hellbent on vengeance for the murders of his wife and son. Lest anyone forget what movie they came to see characters repeat ""Jonah Hex"" a couple of dozen times during the course of this inane action flick. CALENDAR Summer movie preview Director Jimmy Hayward a former animator helmed the fun Horton Hears a Who and worked on the first two Toy Story films. His first live-action effort is not as illustrious. Jonah is played by Josh Brolin who doesnt do much but glower as much as he can manage a facial expression given the makeup he wears to simulate the monstrous scar across his face caused by a branding iron. That experience somehow brought him in touch with the supernatural. When he lays his hands on a corpse life courses through them -- a handy trick when you need crucial information. John Malkovich plays his arch nemesis Quentin Turnbull a former colonel in the Confederate army who has inexplicably turned into a madman. They hate each other but its hard to muster up any concern about where that enmity will lead. Malkovich seems to have spent the last few decades of his once-impressive career playing variations on the sneering rage-aholic villain theme. Only his accent and hair length change. Jonah drifts dabbles in bounty hunting and sidles up to Lilah a comely prostitute played by Megan Fox in a performance so inert she seems carved out of wax. For the climactic battle with Turnbull Jonah and Lilah join forces. Gun battles and explosions happen. Turnbull has gotten his hands on a super-weapon that can take out most of Washington constructed by none other than Eli Whitney creator of the cotton gin. Poor Whitney has his inventors good name smeared in this revisionist history nonsense. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Frank Masi Josh Brolin in ""Jonah Hex"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Yep its hexed. ""Jonah Hex"" is to film what the chicken nugget is to cuisine. Bland anonymous packed with non-nutritious filler prepared without pride or love easiest to consume if youre not paying attention. This is industrially processed entertainment at it cheapest nastiest and greasiest. Josh Brolin plays the title character a Civil War veteran wandering the lawless chaotic West where the main activity of daily life is settling old scores. Fight scenes erupt every five minutes. This is not a comment on the Hobbesian brutality of the untamed frontier. The players continually empty the contents of their guns into each other because the filmmakers recognizing they havent given us interesting characters to follow fear well get bored. The plot ... sigh where to begin? The explosion-prone story isnt strong on exposition. Illogical plots are fine in hot-weather comic-book movies but ""Jonah Hex"" (based on a DC Comic) is stupefying. Director Jimmy Hayward a Pixar veteran in his live-action debut has created a slapdash movie littered with discordant scenes and editing too arbitrary to follow. The film attends to its myriad confusions in a long baffling animated sequence apparently added when the cast and crew got sick of shooting real-life footage. The gist of it is that Hex bears a grudge against Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich King of Camp Cinema). Turnbull is a marauder who slaughtered Hexs family before his eyes then used a branding iron to give him a facial scar that resembles a cheeseburger. But allowed him to live. This is how feuds get started. Understandably Hex is an ornery galoot. He grimaces like an ulcer patient communicates in grunts and growls and shoots people who wisecrack about his disfigurement. A bullet in the gut is Jonahs version of a witty retort. But he is no ordinary gunslinger. Hex has the power to restore the dead with his touch. Dont ask me to explain this. I gave up making sense of it 10 minutes in. JONAH HEX 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action disturbing images and sexual content. Rather than using his magic power to bring back his wife and son Hex wants revenge on the fey absinthe-sipping Turnbull. His ally is Lilah (Megan Fox) a feisty whore who has been manhandled by Turnbulls henchmen. She would be Hexs love interest except there is nothing lovable or interesting about her. Fox presents herself onscreen like a woman who is extraordinarily conscious of her looks and little else. Turnbull raises the stakes on his villainy by plotting to destroy Washington D.C. with a sort of atomic Gatling gun. This steampunk gizmo will put historians in mind of ""Wild Wild Wests"" 100-foot-tall missile-launching mechanical spider. Throughout these proceedings cutaways to President Grant (Aidan Quinn) show him looking like he could use a drink. Who can blame him for wanting to drown his sorrows after appearing in this fiasco? If the film were more excitingly bad we could call it a bomb. As it is ""Jonah Hex"" is a fizzle.

Unlikely to be remembered as one of Warner Bros. more illustrious DC Comics properties ""Jonah Hex"" casts a weak spell. An ultra-stylish attempt to spin the gunslinging bounty hunter from a little-known 1970s comicbook series into the stuff of movie myth this supernatural neo-Western actioner earns some distinction by virtue of its grungy post-Civil War settings and offbeat casting. But ""Jonah"" was a risky proposition to begin with and the films noisy slam-bang approach and lack of imagination in all nonvisual departments will keep it from rounding up a fresh generation of thrill-seekers. It doesnt inspire confidence to discover that the filmmakers went to the trouble of mounting a costly and elaborate production to introduce an unsung antihero to a overcrowded comicbook-movie market only to end the pic at a mere 81 minutes (including closing credits). While the door is left open for a sequel its hard to imagine a studio or an audience getting terribly excited about the prospect after such a numbing pyrotechnic display in service of a perfunctory revenge saga -- one that happens to be set on the troubled eve of Americas centennial. Amid a series of rapid dissolves and crude 2D animation the prologue finds Confederate soldier Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) strung up and forced to watch as his wife and child are murdered by his commanding officer Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich adding to his gallery of one-note evildoers). Fanatically devoted to the Souths cause Turnbull proceeds to brand his initials into Jonahs cheek leaving a painful permanent reminder of the soldiers inner torment. Years later Jonah has become a bounty hunter a brooding embittered loner who does most of his talking through the barrel of an 1873 Colt (or via the Gatling guns conveniently attached to his horse) and reserves his sole interpersonal exchanges for a fetching young prostitute Lilah (Megan Fox). But when Jonah learns that Turnbull presumed dead but very much alive is planning to launch a cataclysmic attack on the Union he makes it his mission to save the nation and settle the score. This gives rise to the tales most striking narrative innovation as Jonah gleans key information by communicating with the dead -- a gift he demonstrates in a series of ghoulish yet oddly poignant interludes with talking corpses (expertly rendered by the f/x and makeup teams). Its one of the few memorable touches in a picture that -- despite numerous opportunities for clever historical revisionism and visual artistry (some of which are realized in Tom Meyers sun-drenched production design and Michael Wilkinsons spot-on costumes) -- ultimately favors the expedient and the explosive at every turn. This should come as little surprise given that ""Jonah Hex"" was scripted by Brian Neveldine and Mark Taylor (the writing-directing duo behind ""Gamer"" and the ""Crank"" movies) who were originally slated to direct before exiting the project citing creative differences. While the helming reins were handed over to animation maven Jimmy Hayward (""Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who"") its the signature of Neveldine amp; Taylor (as theyre billed here) that remains most evident in the films shotgun wedding of oater iconography and videogame aesthetics -- all smash edits feverish cross-cutting color-saturated lensing and a thunderous heavy-metal score -- as well as its fusion of old-fashioned artillery and futuristic weaponry. Given the relative paucity of Westerns on the current moviegoing landscape its somewhat dispiriting to encounter a movie that would painstakingly erect a facade of 19th-century mining towns military forts and runaway locomotives (pic was lensed primarily in Louisiana) only to blow every one of those sets to yawn-inducing smithereens -- all presided over by Malkovichs leering megalomaniac hamming it up like some kind of Southern Bond villain (""Ahhhm the detonat-uh""). Brolin has shown a natural affinity for material with a Western bent (whether its ""No Country for Old Men"" or presumably the Coen brothers upcoming ""True Grit"" remake) and hes well cast as the tortured central figure even if the script never allows him the time or the scale to make Jonah Hex much more than an anguished character sketch. Thesp is forced to grunt and scowl through one side of his mouth thanks to that convincingly gruesome prosthetic scar which makes some of his gravelly voiceover unintelligible. While Fox is adequate as a whore packing plenty of heat in her corset the unusual supporting cast is an embarrassment of underutilized riches Michael Fassbender makes a memorable impression as Turnbulls nasty No. 2 while Michael Shannon is almost unrecognizable as a fiendish carnival impresario. Elsewhere Aidan Quinn Wes Bentley and Will Arnett (in a rare noncomedic role) register far too fleetingly.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The only thing sadder than Jonah Hex is what appears to have happened to his movie. Hex (Josh Brolin) is a renegade Confederate soldier and bounty hunter looking to finish off the general (John Malkovich) who killed his son and burned half his face. The movie began life as a macabre postbellum western for DC Comics. Now its lumbering action-camp following a video game plot.Brolin scowls throughout most of ""Jonah Hex. But other actors and subplots pop up then vanish. Michael Shannon Will Arnett Aidan Quinn (as U.S. Grant no less) Michael Fassbender that guy from ""The Watchmen (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) the dude from ""American Beauty (Wes Bentley) the enticingly poised lieutenant from ""The Wire (Lance Reddick) the chick in the ads for the next ""Twilight movie (Julia Jones) They all come and more or less go.Its unclear how long this movie was meant to be. But at 81 minutes its charred bullet-riddled mulch. You can see the longer movie twitching around inside the shorter one. Even then time refuses to fly. It drags although not entirely unpleasantly. I like the violence in Mastodons guitar-sludge score. And Im still amazed by how the effects department managed to make Jonahs facial scar look so believable. Its like it was cooked in a George Foreman grill. A band of skin reaches from his cheek almost to his chin keeping his jaw from hanging open -- its a mouth and a drawbridge. Brolin appears to be having a decent time clenching his quips with it. Hes laboring though. Clint Eastwood makes that look so easy.So do Eastwoods movies from which this liposuctioned blockbuster cribs. But the director Jimmy Hayward appears to be following Warner Bros. notes for when to blow up something. With all respect placing your next action franchise in the care of the man responsible for ""Horton Hears a Who does not speak highly of your enthusiasm for future installments.Opportunities go begging for pulp or historical rethinking (news of American Indians and freed slaves crop up and boy does Jonah seem like a crypto-libertarian). Instead the movie offers the standard cartoon warfare -- the Gatling guns come in so many sizes -- and bowdlerizes the comic book for maximum box office effect.Now ""the very fate of our nation rests with Jonah Hex. He has supernatural powers (he talks to the dead; thanks Crow Indians) and lies in bed with Megan Fox whos been cast and clothed so imaginatively as a wild-west prostitute. She damsels too easily. In her close-ups Fox appears to be staring out from a music box or a department store window. If she wont be returning to ""Transformers and shes looking for a new recycled franchise might I suggest ""Mannequin?The movies desperate mangled assembly does produce an unexpected side effect. The general incoherence is almost druggy (one of the production companies is Weed Pictures). From Warner Bros. standpoint this seems apt. If the studio thinks this is its next ""Batman it might be high.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

He communes with crows. He can spew black vapor from his mouth. He can grab hold of a corpse and bring it back to life.And he can play footsy with Megan Fox.How Ulysses S. Grant cloistered in his Oval Office in the years after the Civil War heard about this Hex guy is anybodys guess. But when an evil madman hijacks a military train carrying the 19th-century equivalent of an H-bomb Grant dispatches his top soldiers to hunt Hex down and recruit him to save the world.Luckily they find him playing footsy with Megan Fox.Josh Brolin wielding twin Gatling guns and mumbling impenetrably stars in the title role. Wearing a withering scowl a dusty wardrobe and a mix of prosthetics and CGI that makes his right cheek look like gristle that wild dogs have got at Hex busies himself riding around the land capturing wanted men. When a bunch of sheriffs refuse to pony up the reward money - and worse yet try to kill him for his efforts - he whips out the Gatlings and mows em down. And then Hex blows up half the town for good measure.After some voice-overs (Hex gets to narrate his own tale) and an animated sequence that tries to replicate the panel art of the comics its off to see Lilah. Shes a pistol-packin prostitute subtly portrayed by Fox with a lot of corset and garter action and of course a sexy sneer. Somehow when its time to head to the banks of the Potomac to save the president (Aidan Quinn) and the good folk who have come out for the Fourth of July celebrations Lilah is right there alongside Hex shootin the bad guys with the orange balls.Oh right the orange balls Like the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes smasheroo Jonah Hex mixes steampunk weaponry and design elements in there with the more historically accurate period accoutrements. The apocalyptic armaments that vengeful vicious Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich looking like a Woodstock rocker 40 years on) has got his demonic mitts on consist of projectile orbs glowing with a fiery light. When they blow up they really blow up.Jonah Hex - with a directors credit to Jimmy Hayward whose sole other feature is the animated Dr. Seuss adaptation Horton Hears a Who - has reportedly been plagued by problems from its initial conception through production and in post. The mishmash of visual styles (from Old West to Reconstruction South from cartoon to cowboy realism) attests to this.But hey the world needs a hero and if he shows up in a long coat and a tattered Stetson scarred and snarly arm in arm with Megan Fox who knows . . . maybe they can help out another president and plug that hole in the Gulf of Mexico too.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Bad movies arent what they used to be. More specifically bad movies that make it into theaters these days usually have a base level of competence that sets them apart from the bad movies of yesteryear. Dullness dwells where incompetence used to call home. The Raja Gosnells far outnumber the Ed Woods. But every once in a while a film limps into theaters so stitched together its a wonder it doesnt rip apart in the projector. Jonah Hex is such a film. Loosely based on the adventures of a character introduced in the early 1970s as DC Comics answer to grim spaghetti and revisionist Westerns Jonah Hex is the dark story of a tormented bounty hunter with a badly scarred face (Josh Brolin) who wanders the West taking whatever jobs come his way living like an exile from the human race. No wait its about the lighthearted adventures of a gruff wisecracking badly scarred bounty hunter who has all sorts of cool gadgets like a horse outfitted with Gatling guns. No that isnt entirely right. Its the story of a disgruntled Confederate colonel (John Malkovich) who on the eve of Americas centennial turns terrorist (contemporary resonance) and attempts to destroy Washington D.C. using a 19th-century super-weapon. Only one man can stop him the man he hates most in the world an elusive badly scarred bounty hunter who has the ability to briefly raise and converse with the dead like Lee Pace in Pushing Daisies but without the pies. Rumors of trouble dogged Jonah Hexs production from the time its original directors the Crank writing-directing team of Neveldine amp; Taylor abandoned the project up to when director Jimmy Hayward--an animation vet making his live-action debut--conducted last-minute reshoots with another directors help. Trouble happens of course but the 81 minutes (including credits) of Jonah Hex footage that made it to the screen look like something assembled under a tight deadline and possibly under the influence. One flashback makes three appearances. A fight scene with no dreamlike elements apart from a sky tinted red in post-production repeatedly appears as a dream sequence. A chunk of Hexs origin is told by way of animation for no apparent reason. Narration comes and goes. Whole elements like Hexs supernatural powers and Megan Foxs prostitute-in-distress could disappear without anyone noticing. And thats without even mentioning the Native American village that shows up at random. Or the CGI crows. Or the acid-spitting snake-man. (One element that occasionally gives the illusion of coherence a neat spaghetti-metal score. But even that was cobbled together from separate work by Marco Beltrami and Mastodon.) Jonah Hex is what happens when someone promises to deliver a releasable movie by a certain date and then doesnt.

Jonah Hex Bomb to bad Director Jimmy Hayward. Cast Josh Brolin Megan Fox John Malkovich. Rating Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action disturbing images and sexual content. RELATED Movie hookers Westerns Movies based on comic books Spotlight John Malkovich Movie bounty hunters ""Jonah Hex"" somehow manages to waste the talents of Josh Brolin John Malkovich Michael Fassbender Will Arnett Aidan Quinn and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in a story that combines vengeance the occult and an Old West war on terror (really). What director Jimmy Hayward was up to is hard to say; the film has the incomplete feel of something snatched from his hands before he was done with it (its only 80 minutes long). Or maybe he got confused himself and quit trying. Whatever the case ""Jonah Hex"" plays like an extended music video or a middling episode of ""The Wild Wild West."" Either way its not much of a movie. There are some good bits particularly a scene in which Brolin and Morgan face off in the eerie dark of a cemetery. But instead of a real narrative the story such as it is just sort of lurches along from one fight to another. Jonah Hex (Brolin) was a soldier fighting for the South in the Civil War though he didnt believe in its (or any other) cause. A natural killer but appalled at the senseless violence meted out by his commanding officer a sadistic nut case named Quentin Turnbull (Malkovich) Hex eventually defies him killing his son (Morgan) in the process. Turnbull retaliates by killing Hexs wife and child making him watch and branding his face leaving a scar with a hole in it all the better for shots of whiskey to dribble out of. (Despite this seeming hindrance Hex is still able to be a drunk.) Hex almost dies but doesnt quite. His ordeal leaves him able to communicate with the dead who are none too happy to be bothered. Who can blame them? So far so OK. After years as a bounty hunter friend to no one but the industrious prostitute Lilah (Megan Fox) Hex is called back into service by President Ulysses S. Grant (Quinn). It seems Turnbull ever crazier has acquired and assembled a weapon of mass destruction and means to use it. Hes a stone-cold terrorist swearing oaths against the newly restored Union; all thats missing are cable-news networks to broadcast his rants to a terrified populace and talking heads to complain about whats not being done to stop him. This is all doubtless meant to be some sort of commentary on life as we now live it but like the rest of the film it never really goes anywhere. A chase ensues but it feels compressed rushed. All of a sudden were at the climax which is muddied into incomprehension by needless flashbacks set in Hexs subconscious which is as confusing as that sounds. You cant help but believe there was promise here at some point during development. Brolin is always worth watching though he mostly sneers through the hole in his cheek. Malkovich does not shall we say underplay a showy role. Fassbender is actually quite fun as a psychopathic henchman of Turnbulls almost dancing with glee as he kills. Fox is Fox with all the good (looks) and bad (acting) that implies. Hayward creates some gorgeous shots of desert sky threatening clouds and such. But it adds up to nearly nothing. Did they run out of money? Time? Patience? Or did they just film a story that wasnt ready to go in front of the camera? Whatever the case ""Jonah Hex"" is far less than the sum of its parts.
