(Photo Francois Duhamel/Courtesy of Dreamworks) The really poetic weirdness though comes in a pair of encounters with Michael Shannon as John the deinstitutionalized son of the Wheelers realtor (Kathy Bates) who bonds with April over her alienation. Shannon is too large for the spaceFrankensteins monster in an ill-fitting suit whose movements (post-electroshock) are out of joint who sees malignancy and self-deceit wherever he looks. The conception is dated By virtue of his mental illness Johnthe nut who comes to dinnerperceives truth more clearly than the sane characters. (Yates doesnt go so far as to suggest like R. D. Laing that madness is the true sanity but theyre in the same ballpark.) Yet theres nothing musty about Shannons performance. In Bug he played (to the hilt) a delusional paranoiac but his John has a different vibeacid wires humming ripping off other peoples scabs to keep from ripping into his own. His scenes are sick-comic showstoppers but not so hilarious you cant see what hes doing torpedoing whats left of the cruise ship. The protagonist of the leisurely romantic fable The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is born old and wrinkled and ages backward which means we spend an hour and a half waiting eagerly for Brad Pitt to look like Brad Pitti.e. superhumanly prettyand the next hour and change thinking Is that all there is? Not much goes on in that face and Pitts resemblance to Robert Redfordpouchy cheeks quizzical half-open mouthtends to underscore whats absent. Redford in his prime was alert and prickly perpetually dissatisfied whereas Pitt exudes complacency. As Benjamin whose heavily symbolic malady has something to do with a supernatural clock designed by a grieving father to move in reverse he gives you no hint what his character makes of the changes. He doesnt bring out the tension between mind and body; he just stares ahead with sad eyes and lets his makeup do the acting. Pitt isnt bad (his noncommittal performance might even appeal to some people who can project on him what they will) but he lets opportunities slide that other physically inventive performers would kill for. The movie directed by David Fincher will probably be a hit anyway because the gimmick (adapted by Eric Roth from an F. Scott Fitzgerald story) is fun to play around with in your head and because its liberating to watch makeup gradually come off an actor instead of getting thicker (and phonier). Fitzgerald spent the later years of his life haunted by the profligacy of his early ones; to reverse time and recover his youthful body and stamina but retain his aged wisdom must have been a blessed pipe dream. Fincher is no humanist (his most vivid film is the clammy clinical Se7en) and he refrains from milking the material for sentimentwhich means the movie isnt mawkish but it isnt especially vivid either. The light is yellowish and diffuse the backdropsthe clock a factory wall the side of a shipoversize. Its a gentle expressionism redolent of death without rattling bones. Fitzgeralds alter-ego finds his Zeldacalled aptly enough Daisywhen she visits the convalescent home where his horrified father abandoned him. She grows up to be Cate Blanchett whose face is uncannily ivory-smooth. When Daisy and Benjamin meet in the middle both at the peak of their physical perfection theyre like two Greek statues basking in each others radiance albeit with dialogue that knocks them down a few pegs I was thinkin that nothing lasts and what a shame that is. As they move toward death one in the direction of infancy and dirty diapers and the other toward old age and osteoporosis The Curious Case of Benjamin Button attains a level of quiet grace. Its too bad that I can barely remember the movie after only a week. Nothing lasts indeed. The remake of that fine old fifties alien-invasion picture The Day the Earth Stood Stilla peacenik rejoinder to all the sci-fi movies in which E.T.s stood in for soul-sapping Commiescomes to a standstill about an hour before the Earth does in the wilds of New Jersey. Trust me folks Jersey turns out to be the ultimate momentum killer The main characters among them renowned scientist Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) and an alien Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) speed toward the Lincoln Tunneland yet as in a bad dream the tunnel seems to get farther and farther away. Just when we think theyre going to make it they pull into a McDonalds. Then they take a detour to talk philosophy with Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese) who lives deep in the Jersey woods. Meanwhile the excellent-looking giant robot Gort seemingly on the brink of going Godzilla on Manhattan transforms into an unphotogenic swarm of CGI bugs and annihilates Giants Stadium. Atop their tanks in the city members of various government forces look at their watches and noisily exhale. Next Doubt Previous 1 2 3 4 5 Next Share this story...

If like me you retain honeyed childhood memories of watching the sci-fi 1951 classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" on late-night television this remake starring Keanu Reeves is likely to be a letdown. But since when have remakes of classics equaled the originals? Youll be doing yourself a huge favor if you go into this movie with lowered expectations. Reeves plays the alien Klaatu who wants earthlings to shape up or ship out. Jennifer Connelly is the scientist who must convince Klaatu that we humans who are turning the planet into a garbage dump are redeemable. For most of the way this ecofriendly fantasy is pleasantly clunky and Reeves whose expressive range here is slim to none is perfectly cast as the alien.

This one with Clint Eastwood as director and star is concerned with honor and atonement with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art takes unapologetic time-outs for unfashionable moral debates revives acting conventions that havent been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls glowers mutters growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime. ENLARGE Clint Eastwood He plays Walt Kowalski a Korean War vet and newly a widower whose pride and joy is the immaculate 1972 Ford Gran Torino fastback that sits in his garage. Detroits suddenly acute problems add a layer of poignancy to a film thats already elegiac. During the industrys heyday Walt worked on Fords assembly line where he installed the steering column in his own car. Now hes retired and embittered a hard-shell crustacean perched on his front porch watching foreigners he deplores as they invade the old neighborhood. Deplores is putting it genteelly. Mr. Eastwood and his writer Nick Schenk give Walt all of Archie Bunkers bile though little of Archies sly wit at least for a while. No need to reproduce the radioactive epithets; suffice it to say Walt never lacks for political incorrectness. While the very sight of a Hmong refugee family next door produces pit-bull rumblings in his throat another target of his ire is Christopher Carleys parish priest Father Janovich who wants to get him into the confessional booth. ""I confess"" Walt tells the baby-faced cleric ""that I have no desire to confess to a boy thats just out of the seminary."" If Walt were only a refurbished version of the lightning rod that electrified ""All In the Family"" audiences decades ago ""Gran Torino"" might be an awkward curiosity and little more. But the filmmaker cares as he did in ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" about racial and ethnic reconciliation and the education of Walt Kowalski begins when a young man from the Hmong family next door tries to steal his precious car. Soon hes involved with the family to an extent he never imagined let alone wanted and ""Gran Torino"" becomes a vehicle for another kind of reconciliation -- Clint Eastwoods coming to terms with the vigilante tactics of Dirty Harry. His new movie isnt an apologia for all that but its a meditation as affecting as it is entertaining on the limits of violence and the power of unchained empathy. It seems to be exactly the movie he wanted to make at this point in his long career even though some of the performances by inexperienced or nonprofessional actors are less than successful. ""Gran Torino"" is defiantly old-fashioned and occasionally albeit endearingly self-indulgent. Most of all its heartfelt and for me the feeling was mutual. Doubt ""Doubt"" leaves none in one respect John Patrick Shanley was the right person to direct this fascinating screen version of his celebrated play set mostly inside a parochial school in the Bronx in 1964. Otherwise doubts abound exactly as theyre meant to along with four examples of superlative acting. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the charming compassionate Father Flynn a pillar of humanity set against the schools steely principal Meryl Streeps Sister Aloysius; she upholds her own authority and that of the Church with rigid conviction and a baleful gaze. In the wake of John F. Kennedys assassination Father Flynn preaches a sermon about loss of faith. Rather than decry it he tells his congregation that ""doubt can be as powerful and sustaining as certainty."" But Sister Aloysius will have none of it. Rather than jump to a conclusion she leaps to one heedlessly when Sister James a naive nun played by Amy Adams suggests that the priest may be paying improper attention to an altar boy named Donald Miller the schools first black student. (Viola Davis is the boys conflicted mother.) Doubt is the vital essence of Mr. Shanleys drama. Every reason to believe in Father Flynns decency or to question Sister Aloysiuss probity comes accompanied by a countervailing doubt. We bring our own doubts to be sure. Theyre based on what weve learned about predatory priests and theyre welcome too for ""Doubt"" is not about dispensing answers any more than its about defending the priesthood. The movie is a mystery tour of human motives and a cautionary tale about the dangers of being sure. The Reader People can give themselves away with a single word. Early in ""The Reader"" which is about words and literacy and much more Hanna Schmitz a German tram conductor played by Kate Winslet comes upon a teenage schoolboy whos obviously ill and takes him into her flat. ""Have you always been weak?"" she asks. The word sounds a faint alarm -- weak as opposed to Germanic-strong? -- that grows louder as the film swings between past and present though also between impassioned and abstract. The story starts in 1958. Hanna seduces the boy Michael (David Kross) making him an eager slave who must read classic literature to her in exchange for their illicit sex. (Hes under-age by several years.) Later as a law student Michael discovers that Hanna as a young woman was a concentration-camp guard. From that moment on the young man (whos played in middle age by Ralph Fiennes) must struggle with the meaning of what he has learned -- he loved her after all -- in something of the same way that modern Germany still struggles with the meaning of the Nazi era. Stephen Daldry directed skillfully from David Hares adaptation of a widely read novel by Bernhard Schlink. The elegant cinematography is the work of two of todays finest shooters Chris Menges and Roger Deakins. (Mr. Deakins also shot ""Doubt."") And the cast is superb especially Kate Winslet who transcends by far the limits of her characters narrow soul. Yet ""The Reader"" remains schematic and ultimately reductive. It really is about literacy which proves to be a dismayingly small answer to the enormous questions posed by Hannas dark past. The Day the Earth Stood Still ENLARGE Jennifer Connelly and Keanu Reeves in The Day the Earth Stood Still. 20th Century Fox ""Everything will be explained"" a government goon tells Jennifer Connellys exobiologist Dr. Helen Benson in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" A space ship has landed and Helen is urgently needed to make nice with the occupants. Whats never explained is why anyone would do such a dumb remake of Robert Wises 1951 sci-fi classic which starred Patricia Neal as a touchingly plain mother and Michael Rennie as Klaatu the Christ-like visitor carrying a message of peace (or else). Where the original film was unpretentious this version with Keanu Reeves as Klaatu is insufferably full of itself an ""X-Files"" episode pumped up to pseudo-cosmic proportions. Where the first one had the warmth of confident artistry this sorry second is as cold and blank as the expression on Mr. Reevess face. Instead of Sam Jaffe doing Albert Einstein John Cleese soldiers through a silly cameo as a Nobel laureate who studies biological altruism. In the spirit of critical altruism I say stay home and watch the real thing on DVD. Wendy and Lucy What you feel about Kelly Reichardts ""Wendy and Lucy"" may depend on what you demand from a movie. Theres no plot to speak of and few lines to speak. Michelle Williams plays Wendy a young drifter from Indiana who with her Labrador mix Lucy gets stuck in small-town Oregon on her way to look for work in Alaska. Thats most of the action except for Wendy losing Lucy and looking for her all over town and a security guard performing simple acts of kindness. But theres another way to look at it the way favored by Ms. Reichardt who made another understated little film ""Old Joy"" two years ago. That is to say very closely with attention to visual detail and an openness to the questions posed by Wendy almost wordlessly. What has brought her this far? She seems to have some direction but how much is hard to gauge. Whats wrong with her? Shes pretty and affable enough but somehow remote; a piece of her psyche may be missing. What happened to her bandaged ankle? Were never told. Whats to become of her? No way of knowing but her slow drift downward is troubling to watch and impossible to ignore. In a minimalist film of muted emotions Michelle Williams gives as lovely a performance as a moviegoer could ask for. Its a portrait of a life going grievously wrong or one thats never been right.

ABOUT THE MOVIE The Day the Earth Stood Still   (out of four) Stars Keanu Reeves Jennifer Connelly Kathy Bates Jaden Smith John CleeseDirector Scott DerricksonDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for some sci-fi disaster images and violenceRunning time 1 hour 45 minutesOpens today nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The best moment in The Day the Earth Stood Still is a throwaway line in which John Cleese is introduced as a scientist who won a Nobel Prize for ""biological altruism."" What exactly would that entail? It sounds like something Cleese and his fellow Monty Python wits might have dreamed up. Actually a good portion of this sci-fi disaster movie is unintentionally comical. And the parts that arent funny are just plain dull. The story an updated version of the 1951 classic about a portentous extraterrestrial visit feels musty and derivative and not only because its a remake. Keanu Reeves plays an alien with the catchy moniker of Klaatu who has traveled to Earth to warn of an impending global crisis. Taking this role seems to spell the impending end of his career. Why talented actors like Kathy Bates Jon Hamm and Jennifer Connelly signed on is hard to fathom. Connelly plays a scientist who repeats ""We can change"" about a half dozen times in the course of begging Klaatu not to destroy the world. He doesnt buy it. While hes a ""friend to the Earth"" hes not too keen on the people inhabiting and polluting it. The spaceship resembles a giant Christmas ornament and some visuals look as if theyve been borrowed from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The only bright spot in this lifeless story is 10-year-old Jaden Smith who plays Connellys stepson. He follows up his 2006 debut in The Pursuit of Happyness with an engaging lively performance. In contrast Connelly seems to be blandly going through the motions; Bates blustery portrayal consists mainly of issuing orders and doomsday pronouncements. Never fully engaging us The Day the Earth Stood Still has more plot holes than a hunk of Swiss cheese. And the story is about as fresh as a stale cracker.

"The Day the Earth Stood Still Misbegotten makeover | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe Day the Earth Stood Still Misbegotten makeoverKlaatu barada no go  I promise not to blow up your planet if you ignore this urgent warning to shun The Day the Earth Stood Still remake.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 12 2008 The Day the Earth Stood Still (out of 4)Starring Keanu Reeves Jennifer Connelly Kathy Bates Jon Hamm and Jaden Smith. Directed by Scott Derrickson. 103 minutes. At major theatres. PG Klaatu barada no goI promise not to blow up your planet if you ignore this urgent warning to shun The Day the Earth Stood Still remake.But it could make you feel like ravaging Hollywood. The rocket scientists behind this misbegotten makeover have managed to botch every aspect of this beloved 1951 film from robot Gort (now a one-eyed Gumby) to the barely heard ""Klaatu barada nikto"" retort.One scene deserves extra scorn as both the years silliest movie moment and most egregious product plug. Its the one where alien visitor Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) takes his Earthling groupie Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) to the local McDonalds for a meeting about his plans to scorch the planet. Want fries with that apocalypse?Worst of all is the politically correct tone. While Klaatus threat to mankind was always slightly goofy - stop being violent or well smash you - the original film made sense within the context of the Cold War. You could understand how other planets might fear careless humans monkeying with nuclear weapons even if these same humans were also busy building tailfin cars.Klaatus beef with Earth is now ecological. Hes like Al Gore with less charisma. Arriving in a glowing orb in New Yorks Central Park (a pointless shift from the original Washington D.C.) he tells us we have to stop polluting our planet or hell remove us from it and leave it a smoking cinder ball. I guess hes making it ready for Wall-E to move in but is this progress? And what business is it of Klaatus if Earthlings choose to foul their own nest?Then theres the acting. The immobile Reeves makes a plausible Klaatu (although hes no Michael Rennie) but hes taken his usual wooden acting to the level of Douglas fir. Reeves makes Pinocchio look Shakespearean but perhaps he deserves credit for delivering lines like ""It feels unreal to me"" with a straight face. The other players are all mere gaping hicks within a bilious CGI storm of flashing lights flattened stadiums and swarms of metal locusts that look like they migrated from The Mummy franchise.Connellys character has been upgraded from secretary to scientist but neither she nor fellow egghead Michael Granier (Jon Hamm from TVs Mad Men) exhibit much brain power.Kathy Bates is the U.S. defense secretary who has to explain to Klaatu why the president and vice-president are too busy to meet with him - and by the way Mr. Klaatu youre under arrest. No wonder she looks uncomfortable - she usually appears in good movies.Will Smiths son Jaden plays Connellys son in a casting decision of commendable inclusiveness but dubious dramatic effect. John Cleese is the math whiz whom Klaatu upstages reminding us of how funny the Monty Python sketch about alien Scotsmen was.The kindest thing that can be said about this tragic waste of pixels and this is taking seasonal charity to the max is that director Scott Derrickson and screenwriter David Scarpa at least tried to pay homage to the original film.But all of their updates look cheap and phony especially the so-called special effects. Why have Klaatu arrive in something that looks like a Greenpeace snow globe instead of a cool flying saucer? The only awe this movie inspires is realizing how well the original stands up and how little we puny Earthlings have learned in the past 57 years.

It carried two passengers an alien called Klaatu (Michael Rennie) who had obviously visited us before there being no other explanation for his perfect Oxonian accent and a robot named Gort who was played by a giant whose day job was doorman at Graumans Chinese theater. The visitors represented an alliance of outer space planets and they were on a mission to warn us earthlings to mend our warlike ways. Klaatu wanted to convene a conference of intellectuals and statesmen and to demonstrate the superior powers of the aliens by bringing all the Earths mechanized powers to a halt for a few minutes. If that warning didnt take he mentioned the possibility of burning Earth ""to a crisp"" in order to preserve intergalactic peace. There was common agreement especially among the young that Robert Wises The Day the Earth Stood Still was a really neat movie. And so it remains for a lot of reasons its timing at the onset of the atomic age and the cold war; the clear identification of Klaatu as a Christ figure (his earth name is John Carpenter -- or ""JC"" if you care to parse those initials -- and his surname refers us to Jesuss occupation); the fact that its success helped initiate what amounted to a new and potent movie genre -- sci-fi -- and above all the way it keeps faith with its roots in parable telling a simple story in powerful terms stressing a firm easy-to-read moral and keeping the special effects to an almost homemade level. It is in my opinion one of the most lovable and watchable movies of the postwar era. (See the Top 10 1950s sci-fi movies.) Now 57 years later someone has had the not inherently bad idea of remaking the movie. The nukes continue to proliferate and weve added the potential for ecological suicide to our arsenals of self-destructiveness so why not redraw Days moral for a new generation? Unfortunately the new director is a dope named Scott Derrickson who has teamed with a morally deaf screenwriter named David Scarpa and they have made what must be the worst major release in what may be the most disastrous year in recent Hollywood history. Most basically these aliens are not here to give us a last peaceful warning. Their trigger fingers are beyond itchy and they launch a major assault on the worlds capitals a concatenation of been-there done-that special effects that first deadens the senses and then mercifully induces narcolepsy. The aliens dont really give a chance to respond to their warnings. As a matter of fact since their alternative to our threatening behavior appears to be even more menacing -- it consists of swarms of metallic insects gnawing nastily away at any human flesh in its path -- it makes as much sense to resist the invaders as it does to heed them. You couldnt possibly be any worse off. Then too theyve screwed around with Klaatu played now by Keanu Reeves stripping him of all Christ-like attributes and turning him into a zombie-like figure awash in ambiguity; once he gets to meet a few humans he see that theyre really not such bad sorts after all. The guy was never a ton of fun but formerly he was at least a figure of moral weight and -- especially rare in popular entertainments -- a believably brainy one a kind of public intellectual before that egregious term was invented. Now hes pretty much a drip. I could go on -- pseudo-scientific investigations of Klaatu that produce more glop than useful information a failure even to reference the earlier films famous catch phrase (""Klaatu Barada Nickto"" which essentially means ""Cool it Gort"" and which was on every 12-year-olds lips a little more than a half century ago) a cross-species romance between Klaatu and an earth woman (Jennifer Connelly) that was once rather touching and now registers somewhere between fatuous and nonexistent. But why bother? Suffice it to say that these morons have quite simply turned The Day the Earth Stood Still on its head and whats falling out of its pockets in that upended state is a stream of junk. It does not have the charm of what little boys sometimes carry around with them but rather the nasty glitter of inept box office calculation. I suppose that doesnt make a lot of difference -- the tradition of stupid remakes is a long and undistinguished one. But some of us do have good movie memories and strong affection for the indelible impressions left on us by the populist triumphs of the past. For us and for everyone whod like to join us Twentieth Century Fox has put out a nice two-disc DVD of the Robert Wise original. It cost less than two tickets to this travesty and I urge it upon you. Its the best Christmas afternoon pastime I can imagine. See pictures of cinemas most memorable robots. See pictures of movie costumes.

Photo 20th Century Fox Photo Movie review {ldquo}The Day the Earth Stood Still{rdquo} 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Day the Earth Stood Still Science-fiction drama. Starring Keanu Reeves Jennifer Connelly Kathy Bates and Jaden Smith. Directed by Scott Derrickson. (PG-13. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) You wont realize how much you miss the Cold War until you watch the remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" The original film released in 1951 was a response to bickering post-World War II superpowers and their potential to destroy the planet with atomic power. In the new ""Day"" humankinds poor treatment of the environment is the parable but the results are soulless and boring. This was supposed to be the winter seasons big special effects picture. So why does it make Al Gores PowerPoint presentation look like ""Spider-Man 2"" by comparison? In times like these its comforting to place the blame on Keanu Reeves who stars as the stoic space alien Klaatu. But his wooden and disconnected performance (intentional this time) is maybe the fourth most noticeable example of bad acting in the movie. You know your script is weak when even Kathy Bates cant find a way to make her character halfway interesting. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" begins somewhat promisingly with microbiologist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) getting rousted from her home by a group of government agents who are rushing to gather all the greatest scientific minds in the world. A flying object from outer space is going to hit Earth in just over an hour. How can this movie not be fun? Things start to go downhill when a huge swirly ball lands and out walks spaceman Klaatu (Reeves) and his mechanical bodyguard Gort. More than a half century has passed since the first ""Day"" came out and the robot in this movie actually looks less convincing than it did during the Truman administration. Now Gort is basically a giant Academy Award statuette painted pewter with a one red shifting eye like the original ""Knight Rider"" car. As for Klaatu his otherworldly powers fall somewhere between Mork and ""E.T."" with ""Happy Days"" star Henry Winklers mastery over appliances thrown in. (Klaatu doesnt pound his fist on a broken jukebox until it plays ""Blueberry Hill"" but he does hotwire a polygraph machine Fonzie-style.) After Klaatu shows himself in human form almost nothing interesting happens. There are many sequences where people bark orders in military command centers and political war rooms but rousing action is scarce. The best visual effects sequence involving the destruction of Giants Stadium in New York is already in the trailer for the movie. And while there are many conversations between Klaatu and his human companions about the health of the planet almost no specifics are discussed. As a matter of fact I dont recall the words ""global warming"" ever being spoken. Its as if Klaatu is simultaneously considering both the obliteration of our species and a run for political office. Agreeing with Gore doesnt play well in the red states ... After watching this movie for 45 minutes or so you may start to think that wiping out every human being on Earth isnt such a bad idea. Anything to get Connelly to stop shrieking ""We can change We can turn things around"" over and over. She is awful in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" topped only by her grating onscreen stepson played by Jaden Smith. Its bad karma to ridicule kids in movies so well blame the director Scott Derrickson. No doubt youve seen more natural child actor performances in episodes of televisions ""Small Wonder."" Its a shame because the acting and directing was what made the first ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" great. The special effects as impressive as they were for the time complemented the films message but didnt overwhelm it. In the remake the story seems to be the third priority behind visual splendor and product placement. (In one unintentionally hilarious scene Klaatu has a rendezvous with a second human-looking alien ... in a McDonalds.) One more positive development for loyal Republicans In a year where George W. Bush has taken a beating on the big screen the president barely exists in this movie - instead his bitchy secretary of defense (Bates) makes all of the stupid onscreen decisions. ""Klaatu barada nikto"" is alien for ""Mission accomplished"" -- Advisory This film contains disaster scenes violence and ""Mad Men"" actor Jon Hamm who doesnt smoke in this movie but still does that distracting thing where he gets a really constipated look on his face whenever people ask him questions.

"Day the Earth Stood Still The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; day-the-earth-stood-still-the ) Day the Earth Stood Still The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli By all accounts both the director (Scott Derrickson) and star (Keanu Reeves) of this 2008 film are fans of its 1951 precursor. So what went wrong? At what point did this initially promising remake lose its way? After all Robert Wises science fiction classic The Day the Earth Stood Still is far from a perfect motion picture. Parts of the movie are contrived and there are gaps in logic and common sense. That being said its a powerful and compelling motion picture with something specific to say about the human condition. The new version while admittedly addressing aspects of the first that date it opens new holes some of which are more problematic. Worse it lacks the simple elegance and intelligence of the earlier film and employs special effects and pointless action scenes to replace passages of dialogue. A successful remake has a difficult path to traverse. It must honor the original while at the same time bringing something new interesting and intelligent to the project. The Day the Earth Stood Still fails a little in both categories. Too often the need to be a spectacle trumps the desire to be smart and thought-provoking and this works to the films detriment. The original The Day the Earth Stood Still was like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. This movie feels too much like a 90s/00s generic disaster feature. Okay The Empire State Building remains intact and the Statue of Liberty is still hoisting her torch but lets just say that the Giants and Jets are going to need a new home. Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) arrives on Earth with the giant robot Gort in tow. His vehicle of choice is a giant pulsating sphere which parks in New Yorks Central Park. Before Klaatu can intone ""Take Me to Your Leader"" to the greeting party headed by Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) he has been shot and is on his way to an undercover medical lab for surgery. The operation reveals that under a protective layer of placenta-like material is Keanu Reeves. He has a job to do which includes making a speech to all the leaders of the world and no one - especially not Secretary of Defense Jackson (Kathy Bates) - is going to stop him. In 1951 Klaatu came to Earth to offer a grim prognostication for the human race if we continued pursuing the insane strategy of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction). In 2008 Klaatus beef is global warming. He succinctly states his case for genocide The planet is too valuable to allow its indigenous human population to destroy it. Better that they be eliminated so it can survive rather than allowing them to destroy it and themselves with it. Either way after all mankind is dead. The Day the Earth Stood Still opens strongly with a credible enactment of how such a first contact might occur and a vivid introduction of Klaatu and Gort. Some of the ideas surrounding Klaatus stay in the medical facility are also interesting. The film veers off course during its second half with clichA(c)d ""character building"" sequences pointless pyrotechnics and a lot of running around in the backwoods of a New Jersey that looks suspiciously like British Columbia. The ending is a bit of an anti-climax and lacks the ominous and downbeat ""warning"" of its predecessor. Theres a kid in this movie just as there was in the first one. Here hes the step-son of Dr. Benson and is played by Will and Jadas son 10-year old Jaden Smith. My complaints are about the character Jacob not Smiths portrayal of him. This child is a source of frequent irritation. Its as if he was written with a checklist in mind of all the annoying things 10-year old kids do in movies. Hes not just a stereotype; hes an infuriating stereotype. His arc is equally predictable - he starts out the film as the stepson of the woman he calls Helen but by the end they have bonded and she is ""Mom."" Along the way hes on hand to do things like phone the military and tell them Klaatus location. Keanu Reeves is a good choice to play the implacable world-killer. The low-key largely emotionless actor imbues Klaatu with an alien quality. Mr. Spock would appreciate the characters cold logic as he discusses why the human races time is up. Jennifer Connelly has the thankless role of the sidekick (at least shes a scientist not a secretary). Hopefully she got a nice paycheck. John Cleese makes the films biggest impression in what amounts to a one-scene cameo. He presents an impassioned case for why the human race should be given a second chance then suggests Helen use something other than logic to persuade Klaatu. This opens up a lot of interesting possibilities about where the movie could have gone but elects not to go. Mention must be made of ""Klaatu barada nicto"" which has become a cult science fiction phrase over the years. Remaking The Day the Earth Stood Still without it would be like remaking Star Wars without ""May the Force Be with You"" or Star Trek without ""Live Long and Prosper."" According to the filmmakers ""Klaatu barada nicto"" is in The Day the Earth Stood Still but it is drowned out by the overactive soundtrack. Im still not sure where it is located - it could be in one of two places or perhaps in both. Regardless its inaudible and so might just as well have been left out of the movie. The film does a little better with other nods to the original such as scenes involving a sea of tombstones and a blackboard equation and the re-use of some of Bernard Herrmanns music. If one ignores the fact that The Day the Earth Stood Still is a remake it still falls short of expectations. Theres too little drama and tension and Gorts eventual transformation into a lethal cloud makes for a less-than-thrilling climax. Perhaps the most frustrating thing about the production is that there would appear to be considerable room to update the story and while some of that is done it is largely a wasted opportunity. Remaking a movie is easy. Engineering a good remake is difficult.

The Day the Earth Stood Still (PG-13) Fox (110 min.) Directed by Scott Derrickson. With Keanu Reeves Jennifer Connelly. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS Klaatu. Barada. Nik ... Whoa. Fans of classic science-fiction -- or even of Ringo Starr album covers -- have strong memories of the image a brushed-metal flying saucer landing in Washington to disgorge Gort a towering robot and Klaatu an imperturbable alien ready to unleash violence to ensure peace. But now ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" has been remade. And this time the strange visitor from another planet is -- Keanu Reeves? This remake is being called a ""reinvention"" and its true that there are changes beyond replacing the late Michael Rennie and giving the heroine a more active role. In the first 1951 film Klaatu came to warn us about nuclear armageddon. Here its the ecology. The basic idea is that were ruining the Earth a vital part of the galactic eco-system. So an interplanetary council has made the only logical decision Exterminate one species in order to save the rest. Klaatu it seems is the Terminix man and we are the vermin hes been sent to wipe out. This isnt a bad twist although it would be nice if the film once mentioned the words ""global warming"" ""toxic waste"" or even just ""pollution."" Why bring up the topic if youre afraid to address it? Its as if the script were sketched out by Al Gore then handed off to corporate lobbyists for a rewrite. After a peculiar Himalayan prologue the movie starts in earnest with the aliens arrival. Making the metaphor part of the production design Klaatu arrives not in a flying saucer but in a planetary globe; he wears not a space suit but a second soon-shed placental skin. (Gort happily looks much the same -- only supersized.) Once Klaatu arrives in Central Park though hes immediately shot by a nervous military; escaping from their secret hospital with the number of a sympathetic physician he runs to Jersey where he calls her from Newark Penn. Its rush hour it seems and hes feeling pained and confused. (And who cant relate to that?) This is where things start to fall apart though as the couple drives haphazardly around the state and the good doctor tries to talk him out of genocide -- at one point bringing him to her own fave professor a Nobel Prize winner in ""biological altruism."" But little of this makes sense. Why does Klaatu abandon his plan to address the U.N.? Why doesnt he just give us a safe source of clean energy? And if hed determined to exterminate us anyway why is he so careful not to kill his pursuers? What trendy remakers dont realize is that the creative DNA of a classic movie is as complicated as that of the people who made it; change one element and you risk ruining everything. And by substituting pollution for nuclear weapons the filmmakers have thrown the movie off its axis. Reeves remains monotonously dazed as Klaatu although his affectless delivery actually works here; Jennifer Connelly is as usual the prettiest crying woman in the movies (although I dont know if I quite buy her as a world-renowned Princeton astrobiologist). The rest of the cast is hopefully forgettable. Give ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" points for its clever look and some dazzling shots of Gort. (A sequence in which a military man tries -- foolishly -- to take a drill to him is particularly good.) But the dialogue is often as clumsy as the product placement and the rushed resolution is a mad embrace of Luddite panic thats opposed to everything Klaatu seems to stand for. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" may bill itself as science fiction. But it understands neither. Rating note The film contains violence.

This version stars a somnolent Keanu Reeves (is that redundant?) as an alien visitor and Jennifer Connelly - essentially reprising her role from ""The Hulk"" - as a hot scientist who helps Reeves make mankind realize the dangers of global warming. Why would extraterrestrials care about global warming anyway? In the original the more credible threat was nuclear proliferation and the arrival of the alien and his giant robot Gort was a clear metaphor for McCarthy-era paranoia. Moving the action to the present after a pointless prologue set in 1927 the undistinguished script attributed to David Scarpa (""The Last Castle"") removes the context from a story rooted in a very specific era as well leaving out almost every memorable scene from the original. Yes even ""Gort Klaatu barada nikto"" Were the filmmakers afraid of comparison or worried that if the affectless Reeves were killed and brought back to life audiences couldnt tell the difference? The only improvement in this edition directed without noticeable enthusiasm by Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") is the new CGI Gort. Hes a lot more imposing than the original played in a robot suit by a doorman at Graumans Chinese Theatre. The flying saucer in the original has been replaced by a CGI globe that lands not in Washington but an unrecognizable version of Central Park. Much of the movie - a patchwork of scenes from among many other movies ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" - takes place in a geographically challenged New Jersey where Princeton seems to be right next to Newark. A good part of the first 45 minutes takes place in one of the states fictional military installations the first of many tiresome cliches. When Reeves alien Klaatu escapes with Dr. Helen (Connelly) and her annoying stepson (Jaden Smith) the first stop is McDonalds for a risible rendezvous with another extraterrestrial. Another is the home of a learned scientist who has won a Nobel Prize for ""biological altruism."" He is played by John Cleese who used to routinely make fun of stuff like this during his Monty Python days. Meanwhile Secretary of Defense Kathy Bates - complete with a Sarah Palin do - is barking out military assaults on Klaatu and Gort when she isnt asking Dr. Helen ""Do you really think you can persuade him?"" One of the big problems here is that despite much exposition the nature of Klaatus mission on Earth isnt at all clear. And his powers seem to change from scene to scene If he can paralyze military cops to escape then why is it necessary to elude a state trooper by crushing him to death with a car then bringing him back to life? By that point ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is in serious need of resuscitation. The title more or less forces the filmmakers to re-create the earlier movies riveting climax but its as half-heartedly rendered as their CGI version of Manhattan. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next DELGO Read Next DELGO Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46718 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21187 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17476 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(WETA) Joe Neumaier Friday December 12 2008 943 AM Theres a ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""-ish sense of dread beneath the surface of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" but it never sees the light of day. Maybe thats because Robert Wises 1951 classic of the same name is essentially mankinds trip to the galactic woodshed for our violent nature and atomic weapons. The new version presents our failings as ecological yet once again the interstellar agents of doom are a giant robot called GORT and a stiff-looking scold in a 42-long suit.The latter is Keanu Reeves who emerges covered in goo from a giant orb. Before that though astrobiologist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) has been shuffled into a military transport with a bunch of jabbering eggheads to identify an object hurtling toward Earth. This is the kind of movie in which when they arrive the feds basically tell Helen to leave her young stepson (Jaden Smith son of Will) at home; hell be fine except for maybe that huge hurtling object. Its also the kind of movie where a fellow scientist (""Mad Mens"" Jon Hamm) says ""Ill have to crash-brief you"" and later tells the secretary of defense (Kathy Bates) that a cosmos traveler is ""the most important discovery in the history of mankind"" Once Reeves alien named Klaatu as in the original breaks free of the U.S. government hes on the run and distracted from his job to announce that advanced planets have decided this one can be saved but only without us on it. Dude - voted out of the universe. Harsh. The stone-faced silliness in this new ""TDTESS"" at first seems like an homage to old-fashioned 50s watch-the-skies movies until it becomes clear its just newfangled bad filmmaking. Early on theres some jumpy paranoia though once Reeves Connelly Hamm and Bates move their lips things go south. It isnt their fault though; the script doesnt even give Klaatu the big moment of telling the worlds collected leaders to get green or die. Instead he briefly banters with a professor (John Cleese) about humanity being on the precipice. And theyve nixed the famous ""Klaatu barada nikto."" The films major action sequences are never exciting and even the now-requisite destruction of New York feels lazy. (No one even comments on half the city being eaten by space locusts. Maybe theyre mulling that news report early on that says ""Financial markets react to alien invasion."") At least GORT has graduated from huge paperweight to building-size threat. However this story remains a philosophical discussion not ""Independence Day"" and the attempt to make it that results in something just as clunky as a mega-robot with laser-beam eyes. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Keanu as Klaatu is not much of a stretch.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune December 12 2008 -- 823pm Doane Gregory Associated Press - Ap Jennifer Connelly left Jaden Smith and Keanu Reeves right are shown in a scene from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Neither offensively bad nor particularly good ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" may be best remembered for the clumsiness of its intrusive product placement. Armageddon is brought to you courtesy of McDonalds and Honda. In one ludicrous shot the corporate co-sponsors commingle their pitches as the Golden Arches reflect gigantically against the Hondas windshield. ""Were here"" announces spaceman Keanu Reeves. Jennifer Connelly at the steering wheel helpfully responds ""McDonalds"" For not choking as she delivered that line Connelly deserves a major award. The film is based on the 1951 flying saucer classic that brought us gentle alien Klaatu and his laser-eyed guardian Gort who come to our planet warning us humans to clean up our act or else. Nowadays they like to call these needless remakes a ""re-imagining"" but how much imagination does it take to cast Keanu Reeves as the E.T.? Cant you come up with a half-dozen more interesting choices just off the top of your head? Johnny Depp Ralph Fiennes Tim Roth John Malkovich Javier Bardem -- easy The rest of the film is equally inspiration-bereft essentially laying a sheet of tracing paper over Robert Wises film and copying the outlines. The Cold War original was a warning about nuclear annihilation and this time the issue is ecological devastation. If this is thinking outside the box its a tiny box. The film gives us Reeves in his two most distinctive acting modes Beard Keanu and Clean-Shaven Keanu. Beard Keanu is making a solo ascent up an Indian mountain in 1928 when he encounters a glowing orb encased in ice. Clean-shaven Keanu arrives on the scene in the present day after landing in a bigger orb and shedding a whale-blubber placenta to walk among humans unnoticed. ""This body will take some getting used to"" he monotones and true to his prediction he never does master convincing facial expressions. Like a poor mans Michael Rennie Keanu dolefully observes inhumanity in action after escaping from a military base with space-biologist Connellys help. Her spunky/adorable stepson (Jaden Smith) in tow she tries to persuade him not to pull the plug on humanity. She even brings in John Cleese as her Nobel Prize-winning mentor to change Keanus mind but the visitors logic is cold-bloodedly Vulcan ""If Earth dies you die. If you die Earth survives."" Even a meeting with another resident alien at -- yes -- McDonalds fails to deter him from his mission. Meanwhile Kathy Bates frowns as U.S. Defense Secretary Pantsuit McGravitas. What you really want to know about is Gort the robot bodyguard that was the coolest character in the first film. Well hes a very tall computer-generated action figure and he uses his eye-beam to knock down fighter jets and explode tanks. He sees a good deal more combat action than in the original ""Day"" but hes less mysterious and threatening. In the first film we were warned that Gort could destroy our planet unless he received the shutdown code (all together now) ""Klaatu Barada Nikto."" Exactly how he would do his dirty work was left thrillingly unclear. Here we see his destructive power unleashed and its kind of a letdown. All Im gonna say is this Space cooties. Lots of them. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some sci-fi disaster images and violence. The original ""Day"" looks quaint and cheap today but the filmmakers compensated for its budget and special effects deficiencies with story and characters. The 2008 version disguises its story and character deficiencies with budget and special effects. Klaatu is right We are not making progress.

Share Print Save to your profile Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald When the alien Klaatu stepped off his spaceship the first time in 1951s The Day the Earth Stood Still he had come to warn us that mans constant warring against itself had become a threat to other civilizations and we had better stop it -- or else. In director Scott Derricksons respectful perfunctory remake Klaatu once again comes to visit us with a warning although hes apparently been hanging out with Al Gore since its what were doing to the environment that now has the extra-terrestrials wringing their hands (tentacles? pods? suction cups?) Just because the new The Day the Earth Stood Still is green though doesnt mean its dull. If anything theres a lot more mayhem and destruction this time around. Gort Klaatus red-eyed robotic guardian is a lot more short-tempered than he used to be (as well as a lot bigger). And when he goes on the rampage even Godzillas got nothing on him. Klaatu is played by Keanu Reeves who you could say was born to play the role of an expressionless unemotive alien and Jennifer Connelly is the female scientist and single mom who finds herself on the run alongside the otherwordly visitor. Kathy Bates plays the secretary of defense although going by the humorless way she barks orders at everyone they might as well have made her the president. The performances ultimately dont count for much in The Day the Earth Stood Still since the new version -- unlike the original -- is mostly a special-effects show. But what special effects they are Director Derrickson knows how to avoid the fake pasted-in look that plagues so much computer-generated movie imagery and the visuals in the film (which should be seen in its IMAX incarnation for maximum effect) are pretty nifty stuff such as the sight of Giants Stadium getting devoured by -- well no fair telling. Even if you know the original by heart the new Earth has a couple of surprises in store although the message remains the same Watch it Man.

During its final act alas it repeatedly sacrifices narrative logic for CGI-spawned spectacle all the while building toward an ending that aims for the ambiguity of 2001 but misses by several light years. For the benefit of those who tuned in late The original 1951 Day the Earth Stood Still was a cautionary Cold War-era fable -- intelligently scripted by Edmund North efficiently directly by Robert Wise -- about a tough-loving extraterrestrial Klaatu (played with unflappable dignity by Michael Rennie) who issues an ultimatum to earthlings hellbent on threatening each other (and by extension the rest of the universe) with nuclear weapons Chill out or get chilled. Klaatu is accompanied on his peacemaking mission by a humongous robot named Gort -- a laser-armed behemoth who responds to the classic command ""Gort Klaatu barada nikto"" -- but he demonstrates his ability to obliterate humanity in a scrupulously nonviolent (yet totally convincing) fashion. In the new but not improved version Keanu Reeves takes over the role of Klaatu whos been re-imagined by director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) and scriptwriter David Scarpa as a vaguely defined alien life force that assumes human form and doesnt seem particularly happy about it. Rennie underacted the part to the point of sporadic stasis but Reeves makes him look in retrospect like an over-caffeinated show-off. On the other hand -- and theres no way to say this without sounding snarky -- Reeves has the edge when it comes to conveying the concept of a stranger in a strange land and a strange body. The deliberateness of Reeves gestures and the monotone of his speech often cause for unintended laughter in other movies are altogether appropriate here. So its not really Reeves fault that this updated remake -- in which Klaatu has zero tolerance for global warming not nuclear proliferation -- is about as satisfying as a plate of lukewarm leftovers. Derrickson lavishes expensive production values on his twice-told tale and to his credit generates some modest suspense here and there. After being wounded by a trigger-happy Army marksman Klaatu escapes from a heavily-guarded government laboratory and takes flight with a sympathetic scientist (Jennifer Connelly in the kinda-sorta equivalent of the role originally played by Patricia Neal) and her too-cute-by-half stepson (Jaden Smith). And even though theyre being pursued by what looks like all branches of the U.S. armed services and the combined police departments of three or four states the fugitives have time to briefly visit another scientist (John Cleese) while making a wink-wink nudge-nudge allusion to a key scene from the 51 film. But the remake jumps the tracks and quickly plummets into frenzied incoherence when the new films bigger and badder version of Gort transforms itself into ... into ... well gee its hard to describe. A swarm of high-tech locusts maybe? In any event what follows is a great deal of f/x excess as various large items -- a trailer truck here a football stadium there -- are arbitrarily destroyed in scenes that seem designed less to advance the plot than to jazz up TV ads and coming-attractions trailers. This in turn leads to an ending that reprises Klaatus ultimate power play from the 51 movie for no apparent purpose. After that the remake doesnt conclude it merely stops. At which point audiences can be forgiven for shouting rude remarks at the screen.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The close encounter in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" doesnt exactly begin with a warm ""how do you do"" for the being sent to warn humans they are on the wrong course.When the visitor emerges from a giant sphere parked in Central Park hes shot. What happens once the wounded extraterrestrial is transported to a secure location to be operated on feels like a scene from one of those Discovery Health trauma shows ""E.T. with a GSW to the ER stat."" ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" starring Keanu Reeves as alien Klaatu is a slight goofy sentimental riff on humans -- our catastrophe-courting foibles as well as our goodness. Casting Reeves as the alien that a surgeon discovers encased in a placental goo makes sense. The actor has a gift for looking slightly new to the world. And he maintains the pose of being fresh to this planet and his human form throughout. Oscar-winner Jennifer Connelly plays astrobiologist Helen Benson. One of a number of scientists the government enlists (kidnaps is more like it) she becomes Klaatus guide. She is also our representative of human decency. Director Scott Derrickson and writer David Scarpa have updated Edmund H. Norths script for the 1951 sci-fi flick. In place of a Cold War allegory about an alien that comes to chide humans for their violence toward each other theyve delivered a global-warming parable. Poor Earth. Poor humans. Its no surprise that the latter need the former more than the reverse. Not unlike last years very earnest enviro-doc ""The 11th Hour"" this cautionary flick isnt just about our sorry stewardship of the planet. It also mourns humankinds potential demise. A melancholy ache runs through ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" In a roadside diner an alien who has lived among us for 70 years reports to Klaatu that humans are destructive. Still he doesnt want to leave. Our potential for kindness is embodied in the relationship between Helen and stepson Jacob (Jaden Smith of ""The Pursuit of Happyness""). She loves him. Angry at the death of his father he rebuffs her. She remains constant. One of the films sweeter moments comes early when a soldier catches Helen talking on a prohibited cellphone to Jacob. Its a scene that asserts that we are creatures of profound attachments. Some are even worthwhile. Still the initial lesson gleaned from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is that humans overreact mightily to the unknown. Kathy Bates plays Regina Jackson the secretary of defense. The prez and the veep are already hunkered in their respective bunkers. So shes the movies muscle in a situation that could have used some soft-power diplomacy. Theres not a lot of sophistication to the screenplays depiction of global politics in crisis. The smarts such as they are are poured into the science or at least how scientists are portrayed. They are a curious bunch not immune to shock and awe and sigh hope. Mathematicians and other braniacs in the audience may get a giggle out of the equation found on the blackboard of professor Barnhardt the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Helen and Klaatu visit. The rest might get a kick out of the guy who plays him John Cleese (""What is my theory? This is it. . . ."") For a too-brief moment ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" looks like it might honor its cheesier 1950s origins. In a ravaging soundstage storm a lone explorer (also Reeves) comes across an orb that looks like a cross between a giant marble and a murky crystal ball. What does it portend? Not all wed have hoped for. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" doesnt lack heart. Its surprisingly sincere. No the human quality it could use a bit more of is humor. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" PG-13 for some sci-fi disaster images and violence. 1 hour 43 minutes. Directed by Scott Derrickson; written by David Scarpa; based on Edmund H. Norths original screenplay; photography by David Tattersall; starring Keanu Reeves Jennifer Connelly Kathy Bates Jaden Smith John Cleese Jon Hamm. Opens today at area theaters.

The Day The Earth Stood Still Director Scott DerricksonGenre Sci-FiRunning Time 103 minutes Rated PG-13 for some sci-fi disaster images of the destruction of the entire world. Watch Clips Operation Interrogation Save The Earth i Klaatu Barada Nikto Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) has to convince Klaatu that the people of Earth are worth keeping. Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Twentieth Century Fox Klaatu Barada Nikto Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) has to convince Klaatu that the people of Earth are worth keeping. Twentieth Century Fox Dunno about the Earth but time certainly stands still for a goodly portion of Scott Derricksons expensively produced but utterly boneheaded remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still; the film is well under two hours long but the experience of watching it seems to go on until the end of days. The original was a 50s-era cautionary tale about atomic weapons; this ones just someones idea of a joke on the phrase ""little green men"" -- ""green"" in the distinctly post-50s sense of ""environmentally concerned."" Sci-fi fans will remember that last time around the alien Klaatu representing a sort of intergalactic U.N. popped by in a flying saucer to warn that humankind having split the atom needed to learn to live in peace -- or risk being exterminated before it could harness the atom for space travel and offload its planetary aggression. This time Klaatu (Keanu Reeves otherworldly as ever) is from a sort of intergalactic EPA concerned about the habitat of one of the universes few life-supporting planets. A reasonable trade I suppose though the filmmakers dont do much with the conceit. They do however mess with subtext in ways that sound cleverer than they play. In place of the first versions New Testament subtext -- in 1951 Klaatu wandered the earth using the name Carpenter died came back to life gave a nifty speech about living in peace and rose heavenward -- the screenwriters have here turned to the Old Testament. Glowing orbs float to Earth where they attract animals of all sorts which leads someone to call them ""arks"" and to wonder what comes next. ""A flood"" suggests hard-bitten Defense Secretary Kathy Bates -- guessing incorrectly as it turns out. What the screenwriters actually send her way is a plague of metal locusts hungry for anything man-made -- presumably foretold in that infrequently-quoted passage of the Book of Exodus in which the Lord calls for the smiting of sports stadiums and big trucks. Keanu er Klaatu has the good sense to run under an overpass (which must not be man-made because the locusts ignore it) but Shea Stadium and a racing tractor-trailer have by that time disintegrated digitally in a very brief flurry of reasonably cool special effects that are the only conceivable reason for attending The Day The Earth Stood Still. And which you can see very nearly in their entirety for free -- and even make them um stand still by pushing pause -- in the movies trailers on the Web.

An airtight excuse for truancy. ""Theres no school today because of the aliens"" 10-year-old Jacob (Jaden Smith) deadpans to his concerned stepmom Helen (Jennifer Connelly) a Princeton astrobiologist whose expertise is needed but pronto. Emerging from the colossal fireball that has descended upon Central Parks Great Lawn are Gort a one-eyed steel giant and Klaatu an adult humanoid encased in what appears to be whale blubber. First the Earth trembles. Then it holds its breath as Klaatu (Keanu Reeves resembling a cross between young Al Gore and middle-aged Dorian Gray) demands to be taken to our leader. He doesnt mean POTUS. The Day the Earth Stood Still an entertaining rethink of the 1951 classic warning against nuclear war follows the general lines of a lightbulb joke. How many astrobiologists does it take to change the Earth? One - but the Earth has to really want to change. And in this film (largely set in New Jersey but shot in British Columbia) its change or die. Connelly a doe whose inquisitive celadon eyes have unexplored depths is one of the loveliest things in movies. Her expression of skepticism giving way to awe sets the tone for the film. In the first two-thirds of the film director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) understands that the human face - especially that of Connelly - is more expressive than any special effect. In a movie that needs proof of why saving humanity is as important as saving the Earth Connelly is its best argument. Moviegoers are evenly divided into two camps those who believe that Reeves is a cinematic black hole and those who believe that his Zen equilibrium suggests a heroic balance of opposing forces. Im in the latter camp. His placeless quality makes him the right man for Neo in Matrix and Klaatu here. A correspondent observes ""If what you want is an actor to suggest that human speech and movement are alien to him Keanus your go-to guy."" His early scenes as Klaatu where the alien life-form has to acclimate itself to a human body suggest that of a toddler taking its first steps - or Jeff Bridges in Starman. The actor is particularly well-matched with Connelly who appears to challenge him to an intense-off. Its a draw. If Connelly is of the less-is-more school and Reeves the less-than-zero-is-more type Jon Hamm - Don Draper on Mad Men - is some sort of generic scientist who doesnt get into the minimalist groove of his costars. Nor does the adorable Jaden Smith (son of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith) who has inherited the genetic gift of commanding the screen. For its first hour the film smartly relies on the human factor and the power of actors faces in extreme close-up. But in an attempt to up the ante in this high-stakes game of Earth vs. earthlings Derrickson shoots the moon with swarms and explosions. While it doesnt undermine his affecting setup neither does it advance it.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.conm.

This botched remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" seriously dishonors the seriously fine 1951 sci-fi landmark on which its based. While technically proficient the new entry has not benefited from the kind of deep think necessary to justify a reworking as the once-bracing premise of a superior power holding Earthlings to account for their misbehavior now seems familiar -- if still valid -- from numerous interim fantasy and disaster pictures. Decent opening biz will surely plummet once the holidays pass. Robert Wises original film was based on a provocative screenplay by Edmund H. North itself derived from the 1940 story ""Farewell to the Master"" by Harry Bates which goes uncredited here. Pic arrived on the early cutting edge of 50s sci-fi effectively embodied early Cold War military jitters and proposed the notion that short of a deity that might impose order it might take an alien threat of annihilation to force humanity to stop squabbling and get its act together. The black-and-white feature was also graced by some unforgettable images notably involving the sleek flying saucer that landed in the mall in Washington D.C. and its occupants the immaculately accoutred Klaatu played by Michael Rennie and his robot guardian Gort. Topping it off was a chilling Bernard Herrmann score. One of the new films many sins is its lack of any primal defining imagery. Instead of a flying ship Klaatu (the sufficiently alienesque Keanu Reeves) and his soldier (a skyscraping perfectly sculpted male form with a destructive ray emanating from its noggin) emerge from a vaguely defined glowing sphere that lands in Manhattans Central Park. Naturally the Armys first impulse is to shoot Klaatu and ask questions later. Unfortunately the script by David Scarpa (""The Last Castle"") rotely retains key elements from the original -- the U.S. governments refusal to grant Klaatus request to speak with world leaders a widow and (step)son as key contacts for Klaatu the latters chat with a like-minded genius all original screenwriter Norths idea -- without giving them any interesting twists. The widow this time Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) has been upgraded to a Princeton prof and high-end scientist while her black stepson Jacob (Jaden Smith) keeps missing his dad who was killed in Iraq. Lots of military bluster personified by brass-balls Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates) keeps the hardware and special-effects team busy but as the story increasingly focuses on Helen Jacob and Klaatu mucking about in the foggy forests of New Jersey the more its apparent Scarpa and director Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"") are lost in the woods themselves. So many other potentially more exciting roads could have been taken. Instead of denying Klaatu access to the United Nations why not let him present his message and see where the chips fall? This is a global story after all so why not in this era of globalization genuinely make it one? There could have been three four five or more Klaatus -- one for every continent -- and the film could have intercut the fateful ramifications of differing international responses to his arrival. Innumerable other dramatic possibilities lie latent in the basic material but the filmmakers timidly ignore them in favor of sticking with very dull versions of the original films characters. Even when Klaatu is persuaded to alter his dim view of humankinds potential to transform itself its unconvincingly motivated. The performers all seem left to their own devices and appear very far from their best. David Tattersall who shot the three ""Star Wars"" prequels seamlessly melds the live-action with the extensive visual effects which were handled mostly by New Zealands WETA Digital. Given limited motivation by the lackluster action Tyler Bates score is several notches above the norm for big effects-driven pictures.

TheSquiddyGoodTimes says August 4 2015 at 1216 pm Great review Todd McCarthy you gave one of the best descriptions on Klaatus counterpart visiting Earth. After all they are a ""friend"" to planet Earth no need to be worrisome folks and military people but still the global upheaval is reaching high stakes that New York has been ultimately abandoned (along with other cities). And for good reason too Not going to spoil why but anyway I dont think the remake discolors the original film. Yes it has a new theme that it tries to tackle with but it merely comes off an advertisement that mainly brushes it off. Could have been more compelling along with the special effects. I liked the information you provided for the technology that handled the digital effects. It was interesting.

Thompson The Day the Earth Stood Still Wednesday December 10 2008 at 4 a.m. By Luke Y. Thompson 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - As in the original 1951 film by Robert Wise (and more or less ignoring Harry Batess original pulp short story ""Farewell to the Master"") the arrival on Earth of a near-omnipotent being named Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) is met with a trigger-happy response. Only the widowed Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) has faith that making friends with the alien might be in the best interests of humanity. But she may not be correct Unlike Michael Rennies mostly benevolent Klaatu version 2.0 is pissed at humanity for trashing the planet and comes prepared to wipe us all out. The problem with this new The Day the Earth Stood Still isnt so much in the execution of director Scott Derrickson who pulls off quite a few compelling sequences and best of all doesnt screw around too much with Klaatus giant robot Gort (at least until Gort suddenly turns into a cloud of tiny robot insects that arbitrarily eat whatever the plot calls for). No the problem here is that there are no big ideas The original Day was both a condemnation of Cold War military paranoia and an allegorical Christ tale with Klaatu dying for our sins before being resurrected and ascending into the heavens warning that hell be back with the apocalypse if humanity doesnt shape up. There are plenty of ways to bring similar themes into play here Klaatu as Bush figure perhaps invading because of our weapons of mass destruction? Instead its never clear quite what his problem is.

"Movie review The Day the Earth Stood Still -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The Day the Earth Stood Still -- 3 out of 5 stars In the reinvention of the 1951 classic. Keanu Reeves portrays Klaatu an alien whose arrival on the planet triggers a global upheaval. As governments and scientists race to unravel the mystery behind the visitors appearance a woman (Jennifer Connelly) and her young stepson (Jaden Smith) get caught up in his mission. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Keanu Reeves as an alien? Not a stretch. Jennifer Connelly as the empathetic scientist who argues to spare the human race? Again on-the-nose casting. The Day the Earth Stood Still a classic parable from 1951 with the most poetic title in all of science fiction was begging to be updated and so it has in this new film starring Reeves and Connelly. The new Day has spectacular effects to back up its sermon (it was preachy then its preachy now) about humanitys failings and how those might annoy a universe thats concerned were about to muck up the neighborhood. But its only about three quarters of a good film a solid thriller that loses heart and ends so abruptly as to make you wonder if the screenwriter didnt simply go on strike and refuse to provide a finale.It begins with a 1928 aliens-visit-the-Himalayas prologue and then leaps into a paranoid modern crisis with scientists including Dr. Helen Benson (Connelly) being ""taken into custody"" to help the government. What crisis they arent told. Then the object hurtling to Earth slows down and parks in New York and they figure it out. Its Close Encounters time. An attempt at first contact ends in a shooting; a creature emerges (Reeves) and scares the willies out of everybody including the flinty Secretary of Defense played by Kathy Bates in humorless ""Im in charge here"" mode. Every question earns a creepy cryptic answer. Wheres he from what is he and what does he want?""It would only frighten you.""He has the same name Klaatu and the same gigantic robot GORT you almost certainly remember from the original film updated and made even scarier.This Day first goes astray when Klaatu-Keanu escapes from government custody and meets up with one of his own kind now in ancient Chinese form (legendary character actor James Hong) and they have a long heart-to-heart about humanitys virtues and shortcomings -- in Chinese not Reeves first language. But the sympathetic doctor has a stepson ( Will Smiths model-pretty son Jaden) who acts tough and cracks wise -- ""Schools canceled on account of the aliens.""From time to time Connelly takes us to the movie this could have been in a tearful moment when she is confronted by a fellow mother a soldier who wants to share her cell phone because they both think the world is ending. Director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) had a new Starman here if hed trusted the actors and the emotions of the piece.In the end the script and the director got hung up on the sermon about humanitys need to change our ways the hellfire and brimstone punishment that awaits if we dont. This Earth could have moved if they had embraced the heart of Starman. Too bad they settled for a half-hearted Independence Day.

Nothing wrong with that but its worth nothing that the dumb-fun part is more effective by far. Director Scott Derrickson and screenwriter David Scarpa obviously had to jettison the nuclear threat from the 1951 original replacing it with a warning about . . . dont want to give too much away. Suffice it to say that its timely if obvious. (Hint Maybe Klaatu can do something about gas prices.) The basic premise is the same A visitor from another planet shows up; the military doesnt exactly roll out the welcome wagon. Nothing says hello like a gunshot. What is the reason for the visit? Can we see beyond our myopic world - um universe - view to even receive the message much less heed it? Derrickson wisely keeps some of the more-memorable aspects of the original intact. Keanu Reeves is the perfect choice to play Klaatu the emotionless alien who visits Earth with a series of seemingly inscrutable statements (hes saving the big message for a meeting with world leaders that no one seems to want to make happen). And Gort the giant robot-looking creature is still around menacing (and dangerous) as ever. The film begins with a team of scientists corralled by the government to deal with an imminent threat - something is whizzing through space heading for Manhattan. Theyre led by Michael Grainer (Jon Hamm) but once an enormous globe has landed in the middle of Central Park and deposited Klaatu Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) is clearly the only one with enough on the ball to recognize that we might want to listen to what the visitor has to say. Certainly U.S. government representative Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates) isnt interested at least not at first. Its all a bit generic the Big Bad Government Official too arrogant to think that she needs to pay anyone else any heed (a position effectively shot down with Klaatus snide retort ""Your planet?""). Klaatu escapes and ends up on the lam with Benson and her adopted son Jacob (Jaden Smith). He reveals his intentions to her He is indeed a friend of the Earth. Thats not necessarily the good news/it may sound like for the people living on it. A meeting with Helens mentor Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese) along with a little well-timed Bach and self-sacrifice leads Klaatu to believe that we might not be the hopeless case he thought (what if Barnhardt had been a Barry Manilow fan?). But is it too late? Though both Connelly and Smith are fine their scenes together are nothing special; its more fun to watch short-sighted government officials demand ridiculous experiments involving Gort. And though Reeves is nobodys Daniel Day-Lewis hes quite good at intoning lines of serious import; he gradually becomes more human but never to the extent that he has to you know stretch. On the other hand he never says ""Whoa"" either. Not that this would have been a bad thing. While its intent is undoubtedly serious youre more likely to take away the cool stylish elements from the film than anything else. Thats an OK thing. Audiences are more cynical than they were in 1951; using what is in effect an expensive B movie for social commentary doesnt pack the same punch. Better to just sit back and enjoy The Day the Earth Stood Still for what it is a fair amount of fun. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

The best thing in the movie is Michael Rennie who as the courtly extraterrestrial diplomat Klaatu exudes the sad yet deeply expressive charm of a haunted Peter OToole. In the expensive but plodding new remake the spaceship -- now an ethereal globe -- lands in Central Park and Gort isnt so lovey-dovey; hes like a super-tall obsidian Oscar statue wreaking havoc. As for Klaatu hes now played by Keanu Reeves who speaks every last line in a deliberately blank take-me-to-your-leader monotone that makes him sound like a kid imitating the rote sci-fi aliens of the 50s Michael Rennie transcended. Reeves seems to be trying to wriggle out of the charge that hes a flat actor by acting flat on purpose. But in The Day the Earth Stood Still he is flat. And boring. And so is the film. Once again the intergalactic travelers have come to Earth bearing a message -- only here its an all-too-predictable environmental one. On the run with a benevolent scientist (Jennifer Connelly) Klaatu warns that if we dont change our ways he and his fellow visitors will destroy the human race in order to save the planet. (Call it the General Westmoreland school of green activism.)
