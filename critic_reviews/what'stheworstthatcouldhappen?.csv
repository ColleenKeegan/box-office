Robert Koehler 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr May 30 2001 | 0403PM PT With a potentially boomeranging title like ""Whats The Worst That Could Happen? a comic movie had better be playing its skillful best. In fact the title is one of the few significant elements that remains intact in writer Matthew Chapmans dreary adaptation of Donald E. Westlakes clever 1996 novel. With a potentially boomeranging title like ""Whats The Worst That Could Happen?"" a comic movie had better be playing its skillful best. In fact the title is one of the few significant elements that remains intact in writer Matthew Chapmans dreary adaptation of Donald E. Westlakes clever 1996 novel his ninth in the series tracking the escapades of amusingly snakebit thief John Dortmunder. The mirthless enervated result of this page-to-screen transfer is a pinpoint study in what not to do with an adaptation as well as in why altering a well-known fictional character to suit a poorly cast star is almost always a very bad idea. The star in this case is Martin Lawrence who is not only thoroughly upstaged by nemesis Danny DeVito but is completely boxed out of his comfort zone for broad physical comedy. Westlake and Dortmunder fans will be enraged and pic will test Lawrences ability to draw his base in the same numbers as his last hit nearly a year ago ""Big Mommas House."" With nary an obese wiggling bottom in sight B.O. prospects appear shaky. What caps the projects numerous frustrations is how Westlakes tome about Dortmunder planning obsessive elaborate revenge against a tycoon who shamed him by stealing his ""lucky"" ring during a heist already reads like a movie and serves things up on a platter for an easy adaptation. From the opening minutes though when a suave Lawrence peruses paintings at a fine auction house and announces himself as ""Kevin Caffery"" to a lovely black Englishwoman named Amber Belhaven (Carmen Ejogo) its not only clear that were a million miles from Dortmunder territory but that Chapman and director Sam Weisman somehow feel sure they can improve on Westlakes mastery of the comic crime genre. When Kevin charms Amber by stealing back the very painting she had just auctioned off we get hints of a budding romantic comedy. Still Kevin gets into the sack with Amber awfully fast just as shes too quick to give him her fathers cherished ring and force him into compacts such as never lying to her -- and this to a self-confessed thief. In Boston things are going badly for tycoon Max Fairbanks (DeVito) a squat terrier of a man dubbed ""the dark prince of plunder"" who is contending with a Chapter 11 filing his bossy Beacon Hill-bred wife Lutetia (Nora Dunn) and his dry businesslike lawyer Walter (Richard Schiff). But once Kevins partner in crime Berger (John Leguizamo) hatches a plot to burglarize Fairbanks Marblehead mansion things get personal. Thankfully preserved intact are the novels crucial moments when Fairbanks entertaining a centerfold model at the manse catches Kevin in the act alerts the cops and tricks the thief into giving him Ambers ring. Thus a war of egos is born The wounded Kevin is determined to not let anyone ""rob the robber"" while the now-peppy Fairbanks is sure he can outlast his legal and fiduciary opponents since he reads the rings symbolism (its logo is identical to his corporations) as a sure sign of luck. Pity the fellow who tries to rip it off his finger. Pic soon sputters into a miasma of its own making as various comic set pieces jump and crash-land with DeVito and Lawrence showing sweat as they try to eke out the laughs. While Westlakes original plotting deliberately separates antagonists until the last possible moment pics scenario has them constantly crossing paths to no net effect except to preen testosterone onscreen. An auction finale is clumsy film comedy on every level bringing all the characters together for one last dull fling. Ridiculous coda plays like a measly bone thrown to fans of Lawrence who finally gets to sport a goofy Afro wig. Nothing in Lawrences uninspired perf justifies the Dortmunder-to-Kevin transformation with the many dead moments giving one plenty of time to recall Robert Redfords wry turn as the thief in ""The Hot Rock"" which remains the best Dortmunder pic. Lawrence does his usual mugging and even though material has been stretched to admit some loud farcical business its nowhere near the raucous level Lawrence likes to play at. As much as Lawrence is a fish partly out of water DeVito is in his element as Fairbanks -- maybe too much so for this feels like a less-energetic replay of DeVitos other incorrigible egomaniacs. The supporting cast of several brilliant comics -- such as Leguizamo Glenne Headly as Fairbanks I Ching-devoted aide-de-camp Larry Miller as Fairbanks security man and Siobhan Fallon and Lenny Clarke as feuding marrieds who assist Kevin -- is almost criminally underutilized. Dunn stands out turning a small role into a much bigger one as she did in ""Three Kings"" while Ana Gasteyer as Bergers wife appears mostly lost in the cutting room. Music selections and scoring are uniformly terrible starting with a mangled hip-hop sampling of Sinatras ""High Hopes"" but production dressed up by costumer Jeffrey Kurland and designer Howard Cummings is kind to the eye.

Yes it is By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- The title of Martin Lawrences new picture ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" is meant as a rhetorical question. But it only takes about 10 minutes of Lawrence lumbering around in especially heavy-lidded thick-tongued style before the unavoidable answer strikes you The worst that could happen is this crummy movie. Lawrence has starred in some pathetic one-joke comedies in the past but hes never seemed as wholly uninterested in his own work as he does here. His pseudo-suave non-performance is arguably the nadir of a nadir-centric movie career. Lawrence plays a professional thief named Kevin Caffrey. In the opening scene Kevin is at an art auction where he meets Amber Belhaven (Carmen Ejogo) a beautiful Brit whos crying because shes selling her favorite painting to pay off some bills. Sensing an easy conquest Kevin later steals the painting from its new owner and returns it to Amber. This criminal act inexplicably causes Amber to fall into Kevins waiting arms.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings The Worst Has Happened By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 1 2001 Danny DeVito and Martin Lawrence are just asking for it in ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" (Sam Emerson/MGM) In ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" the filmmakers respond to their titles provocative question with the following answer this movie.Kevin Caffery (Martin Lawrence) is an art thief whos burglarizing a Marblehead Mass. home when the owner sleazy rich guy Max Fairbanks (Danny DeVito) catches him at gunpoint. As the police are about to haul him away Max does something for pure spite. He takes off Kevins new ring claiming its his. Kevin who just got that ring from the new love (Carmen Ejogo) in his life is determined to get it back. And thats pretty much the story in this dull plodding comedy based on a Donald E. Westlake novel. The casting of Lawrence and DeVito as jugular-hungry opponents could have yielded some funny punchy entertainment. Both are feisty comedians who thrive on aggressively verbal comedy. They could have tongue-fought and eye-warred their way through an amusing comedy. But ""Worst"" is so suffocated by its own plot no ones got time to do more than follow the program. Unfortunately in Hollywood casting is considered more than enough to make a movie. The gags? They can be anything so long as these two play themselves right? Wrong. Lawrence who reaped millions on this date last summer with ""Big Mommas House"" is no Martin Lawrence this time. His routines are flaccid retreads of his usual stuff. And DeVito winner of the Mr. Ubiquitous Award lately also phones himself in. There is one small spark of humor in ""Worst."" And it flashes so brightly you find yourself wishing someone had junked Lawrence and DeVito then rebuilt the whole movie around this character. Thats Detective Alex Tardio played with prim hilarious precision by William Fichtner. A dandy of an officer who suggests a comic combination of Truman Capote Tom Wolfe and David Bowie he blows the two stars away with his wide brimmed hats impeccable white suits and the team of white pooches he loves to walk. Ace Ventura eat your heart out. But we digress. Talking about the best that happens is such a minor part of the big picture. ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" (PG-13 95 minutes) - Contains foul language and sexual situations.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Wasting a Cast of Comedians in the Worst Way By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 1 2001 Danny DeVito and Martin Lawrence are just asking for it in ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" (Sam Emerson/MGM) Whats the most routine that could happen?The answer is ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" the new Martin Lawrence-Danny DeVito comedy that now and then sputters to comic life but more usually wheezes along.Its based on what must have been a clever novel by old pro Donald Westlake and you can see his efficient story structure underneath the sometimes-funny more-often-not plottiness on screen. Its the one about the big thief and the little thief.The Big Thief - DeVito of course - is a Boston-based Murdoch-like media mogul named Max Fairbanks who devours all before him with a bird of preys glee while cheating lying and hiding imperviously behind a high-priced lawyer. His source of income and status is his wifes fortune which he loots while merrily committing adultery. One night in his beach cottage - that would be a 75-room mansion - he captures a burglar named Kevin Caffery (Lawrence) calls the cops and turns the fellow over to them.Except that in a frenzy of machismo and bravura dishonesty he tells the coppers that an inexpensive ring the burglar is wearing is his own; they strip it from Kevins finger and turn it over to the gloating Max. Ha ha he showed him didnt he?But some etiquette between thieves has been ruptured - I guess its that you dont steal something personal from someone whos merely stolen impersonally from you. The gauntlet has been thrown down and picked up; Kevin has to steal the ring back (hell take any cash lying around as well) and Max has to stop him. They escalate into something resembling a full-out war.Thats the gist of the story These two smart rapacious men essentially the same but for the scale of their enterprises become enmeshed in a pointless but irresistible mano a mano over what seems to be the least important thing in the movie the stolen ring. It reiterates a famous dictum about faculty politics The fight is so bitter because the stakes are so small. Of course what is really at risk is each mans sense of being a ruler of the universe.Played straight this might have made a neat little thriller. Of course its played for the broadest of laughs here by the director comedy professional Sam Weisman - perpetrator of some equally laugh-diluted efforts such as the Steve Martin-Goldie Hawn ""Out of Towners"" and Brendan Frasers ""George of the Jungle"" - who never met a pratfall a phony accent or a mistaken identity he didnt love.Weisman seems a little out of sorts with his stars or maybe theyre a little out of sorts with the project. Lawrence has always prospered in the kind of movie that treated him like Dr. J. Everyone backs off and lets him operate. In films like ""Big Mommas House"" he wasnt in the movie he was the movie. Yet ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" is by contrast a plot-driven ensemble piece where the story keeps getting larger and larger the situation more complex drawing in new characters and diminishing reel by reel the main mans screen time.It seems that Lawrences Kevin is part of a criminal subculture as rich and complicated as a Dickens novel and soon enough hes enlisted his girlfriend Amber (Carmen Ejogo) pal John Leguizamo as a burglaring sidekick Leguizamos wife played by Ana Gasteyer (a big talent shes wasted here) a computer hacker played by Todd Poudrier Bernie Mac as Kevins uncle and mentor and a few others.Meanwhile over in the DeVito part of the story the cast is also swelling; theres a lot of business with Maxs wife (Nora Dunn) his mistress (Sascha Knopf) his secretary (Glenne Headly) his lawyer (Richard Schiff) his security chief (Larry Miller) and on and on until its gotten so big it even has room for the U.S. Congress So basically these two dominant performers Lawrence and DeVito have been hired for a movie that puts their talent to its least efficient use. Go figure.The movie becomes increasingly desperate as it becomes increasingly crowded though now and then a scene pops out at you. In one Lawrence and Leguizamo are pretending to be Arab billionaires interested in buying a Washington building merely as a ploy to get into DeVitos apartment. That whole situation isnt terribly amusing; what is amusing is a crazed riff on interpretation the two work speaking a made-up lingo as if its the purest classical Arabic utterly befuddling everyone.But the only consistent source of humor in the film comes from a least expected source. An actor named William Fichtner whose big rawboned face usually consigns him to roles as wife-beaters thugs or abusive fathers (he plays one in ""Pearl Harbor"") checks in as a flamboyant Boston detective named Alex Tardio. Imagine Quentin Crisp with a badge as well as two poodles a fabulous mascara application and a very nice manicure and you get the picture.But in the end the movie collapses under its plot frenzy. Too much time is spent getting in and out of places pratfalling and overthinking every situation.""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" (95 minutes) is rated PG-13 for mild sexual innuendo and a cavalier attitude toward law and order.

"USATODAY.com - DeVito Lawrence steal some laughs Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/01/2001 - Updated 1153 AM ET DeVito Lawrence steal some laughs By Mike Clark USA TODAY MGM Danny DeVito (broke media mogul) and Martin Lawrence (professional thief) in Whats the Worst That Could Happen? Whats the Worst That Could Happen? (out of four) Stars Martin Lawrence Danny DeVito John Leguizamo Glenne Headly Carmen Ejogo William Fichtner Bernie Mac Director Sam Weisman Distributor MGM Rating PG-13 for language and sexual content After weeks of its silly trailer engendering low hopes Whats the Worst That Could Happen? opens with a rap tune laid over Frank Sinatras High Hopes. For any optimistic viewer the hope lies in the vast middle. But this dispensable comedy has a few unexpectedly loopy surprises including an outlandishly gay detective (played by versatile actor William Fichtner) who loves the Ice Capades but loathes insurance fraud. The literary source here is Donald E. Westlake whose underworld novels have been movie material since the late 1960s. ""Stop trippin "" may be too hip for the likes of typical Westlake dialogue yet this Martin Lawrence/Danny DeVito teaming still has a bit of an old-fashioned feel. It recalls those ragged 60s caper pics that now seem to congest cable channels in which the leads frequently play second fiddle to nutty supporting players. And in the ask-no-questions shtick akin to the caper genre professional thief Lawrence takes about five minutes to meet bed and accept a ""hot"" heirloom diamond ring from a seemingly well-adjusted British babe (Carmen Ejogo). And this is after she learns what he does for a living. Lawrence then breaks into the supposedly vacated mansion of broke media mogul DeVito a wily crook in his own right who surprises him by a) being at home and b) stealing the prized ring from him. The rest is a contest of wills all in an effort to get back the diamond; Lawrences schemes include staging public humiliations at DeVitos expense. Along the way we see the normally demure Glenne Headly (chaste Tess Truehart in 1990s Dick Tracy) rolling with DeVito on a couch and John Leguizamo also a thief speaking mock-Prussian (complete with the obligatory monocle) while conducting an auction. Larry Miller in keeping with his smarmy villainous turns in both recent Nutty Professor pics plays the head of DeVitos security who gets maced over and over by an old lady. Fichtners outrageousness aside the supporting actors complement rather than dominate a Lawrence-DeVito teaming thats passably inspired on its own. In fact Lawrence is notably toned down in what is all but a subsidiary role letting his diminutive co-star handle most of the storys rant-and-rave duties. Even if this goofy grabber flops its no bad career move. Whether you relished it or could have done without a second straight movie in a row hogged by Lawrences highjinks would be pushing it after Big Mommas House.

Photo courtesy of Eric Lee A billionaire (Danny DeVito) and a thief (Martin Lawrence) try to outdo each other in ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen? Photo courtesy of Eric Lee Martin under wraps / Comic hasnt enough to do in crowded convoluted Worst 1 / 1 Back to Gallery WHATS THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN? Comedy. Starring Martin Lawrence Danny DeVito. Directed by Sam Weisman. (Rated PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There comes a time in every film comedians career when he curbs his eccentricities for a straighter role. Steve Martin Eddie Murphy  Robin Williams and many others have made the transition. Too bad Martin Lawrence has joined their ranks. A comedic sparkplug who easily can carry a movie (""Big Mommas House"") Lawrence instead yields the floor to character actors who are funny but not as funny as he is in the vendetta comedy ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" Which is not to say he does a bad job. Its just that this sometimes funny but ultimately convoluted movie would have benefited enormously from letting Lawrence loose. TWO MEN AT WAR He plays a high-end thief who breaks into the house of crooked billionaire Danny DeVito. Only DeVito is at home at the time and he not only has Lawrence arrested but he steals his lucky ring as well. The cheeky move sets off a full-scale war between the men that includes numerous robberies computer hacking and obstructed Senate hearings. DeVito is solid as ever as a lusty little despot partial to Playmates cigars and brocade vests. Hes got more to work with than Lawrence hemmed in as a devoted boyfriend and all-around nice guy -- except for the thief and obsessive-saboteur parts. Both actors tap their natural tenaciousness as their characters revel in one-upmanship. But the greatest comedic opportunities are availed to supporting actors. The hilariously deadpan Bernie Mac (""The Original Kings of Comedy"") as Lawrences crime-boss uncle can draw a belly laugh with one raised eyebrow. Lawrence once the consummate scene thief instead lobs em over the net to Mac. William Fichtner (""The Perfect Storm"") has a few uproarious bits as an ultra-fey ultra-serious police detective. In his femininely tailored white suit he has a nose for crime and the casual elegance of Carol Channing. Fichtners character might not be PC but at least hes funny. Not so the old lets-dress-up-as-sheiks routine which Lawrence and John Leguizamo as his fellow criminal cannot breathe life into. Unfortunately this is the best setup Lawrence gets. SHIFTING TONE In a film with many deft touches and humorous throwaway lines (""That was a great place to hang a picture"" Fichtner says of a blank spot on DeVitos wall after a robbery) its too bad the creators had to resort to hoary devices. But they obviously ran out of steam at some point which also shows in the pictures radical shift in tone. Director Sam Weisman and writer Matthew Chapman adapting Donald Westlakes novel start the movie at a leisurely pace leaving room for character development. But by the last third the movie becomes a frenzied pileup of plot twists as Lawrence and DeVito escalate their battle. The biggest misstep though is running the movies best sight gag into the ground. The first visual reference is hilarious the second pretty darned funny . . . by the fourth its pathetic. As comedy goes that sort of repetition is a killer. Advisory This film contains violence raw language.

Genre Comedy; Starring Danny DeVito Martin Lawrence Nora Dunn Carmen Ejogo William Fichtner Glenne Headly John Leguizamo Bernie Mac Larry Miller Richard Schiff; Director Sam Weisman; Author Matthew Chapman Barry Fanaro; Producer (person) Martin Lawrence; Producer (group) Hyde Park Entertainment MGM Turman/Morrissey Company; Release Date Wide 06/01/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 1; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor MGM Posted June 8 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT Theres a depressed and depressing abandon-all-hope listlessness to Whats the Worst That Could Happen? a worst-case comedy that answers its own title question in every scene The worst thing that could happen certainly as far as comedy is concerned is for everyone involved to stop giving a damn. Funny not funny good acting bad what the heck. Lets move on to the next scene people; lunch break in an hour. Thats the feeling anyhow of this gassy hill of beans in which Martin Lawrence plays Boston-based professional thief Kevin Caffrey and Danny DeVito plays Max Fairbanks the billionaire whose North Shore mansion Kevin targets. Now Max we know and understand. Hes one of those brash ball-busting little men in whom DeVito specializes - a loud lewd cigar-chomping vulgarian from the Ruthless People school of ""f - - you."" DeVito is a travel-size physical specimen but hes so lusty noisy and hairy in his hollering and hell-raising that he easily stands up to men twice his stature (e.g. Arnold Schwarzenegger) and the discrepancy between height and breadth of apoplexy is the actors charm. As the tax-cheating head of a colossal company with the paradigmatic name of Global Universal Industries Max bullies his attorney (Richard Schiff doing a variation on his West Wing sadsack civil-servant persona) scares his chief of security (Larry Miller nailing his few screwy scenes) and cheats on his armor-plated wife (Nora Dunn) with a bosomy magazine pinup girl (Sascha Knopf) who really wants to be a TV entertainment journalist. (Laugh go ahead; thats one of the scripts only recognizable jokes.) And so when Kevin has the audacity to break into Maxs mansion - not knowing the tycoon is upstairs hootchy-kootchying with the Entertainment Tonight host wannabe - the captain of industry explodes with outrage A pipsqueak wants to rob Max? Hah Max will fight like a pit bull stealing something of Kevins in return. This escalating revenge might be a fairer and more amusing battle if the Kevin we see werent such a smudge a puddle a disjointed collection of Martin Lawrence routines and comedy postures passing as a character. Kevin is supposed to be educated and discerning enough to spot a fake masterpiece from the real deal yet he shares his heistwork with a motormouthed hothead (John Leguizamo coughing up a nervous string of caricatures from gibberish-speaking Arab emir to monocled German twit) and a hood-styled lounge lizard (The Original Kings of Comedys Bernie Mac). He rolls like a ladies man yet hes immediately smitten and reformed by a random pretty woman (Carmen Ejogo far more effective as Coretta Scott King in HBOs Boycott). Hes supposed to be Martin Lawrence funny - edged with raunch spry in high gear - but instead hes simply all over the map. And wherever Lawrence rolls director Sam Weisman (George of the Jungle) doggedly follows not so much advancing the story or shaping the movie as mopping up spills and stapling down flyaway pieces of acting from the rowdy supporting cast of comedy players. Many of them including past and present SNL cast members Dunn Ana Gasteyer and Siobhan Fallon are improv oriented and play their scenes like blackout sketches for their own amusement. Others including Glenne Headly as Maxs tarot card-reading executive assistant and William Fichtner as a dandyish Boston detective of exquisite wardrobes and exotically ambiguous sexual preferences are old hands at creating outre characters and while away the hours playing with flamboyant scarves and gestures. Too bad none of the talent seems to have been introduced to one other. Whats the Worst That Could Happen? based on a novel by Donald E. Westlake and written as a string of flameout one-liners by Matthew Chapman (Consenting Adults) is one of those all-stops-out ensemble capers that on paper seems ready-made for movie adaptation what with the con men babes and wheeler-dealers passing through ritzy locations. The movie was filmed in and around an airbrushed Boston as we are meant to tell from requisite shots of the city skyline off the Charles River.(As a small-time accomplice of Kevin and his crew Siobhan Fallon gamely weighs in with a full-tilt Southie accent although shes given little to do besides sound blue-collar tough.) Boston gets scrod in this production and so do moviegoers. Maybe the worst thing that can happen is that every other movie at the multiplex will be sold out this weekend.
