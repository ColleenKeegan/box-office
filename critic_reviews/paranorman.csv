This gem is just as beautifully hand-crafted but its definitely not one for scaredy-kids (or possibly even timid parents). Take the opening scene. Eleven-year-old Norman watches a video nasty in which a busty B-movie blonde fleeing a pack of zombies skewers a juicy-fresh prawn-coloured human brain with her stiletto heel. Squelch. At school Norman is nicknamed Ab-Norman. Pale interesting with electro-shock hair (and voiced by the current go-to kid for creepiness Kodi Smit-McPhee of Let Me In fame) hes a training-crush for Robert Pattinson. Oh and he can see ghosts. That doesnt go down too well with Normans dad who fears his sons fascination with all things undead is a gateway hobby to limp-wristed hippy stuff. The plot as terrifically sophisticated as it is - involving a New England Puritan witchhunt and a centuries-old hex - does drag a bit. No matter there are plenty of bogey-green yammering zombies on the rampage. And Laikas dazzling visual vocabularly really does give Pixar a run for its money. The detail down to the zombies tombstone teeth (well dentistry wasnt up to much in the seventeenth century) is breathtaking and there are some brilliant gags - like when Norman struggles to wrench a book of spells from the rigor-mortis-stiff hands of a corpse. Ghoulish? Yes. Funny? You bet.

It is well made very well acted and in places goes beyond very good to become really excellent. However it is at time rather dulll and just tries too hard. Yes there are the cliches about how in bred and dumb most Americans are but I left the film happy but not ecstatic that you should do with a 5 star film.

When a film like this starts out strong so often it can lose steam midway through or completely bungle a singular aspect near the end. From the first few moments of ""ParaNorman"" it became apparent that this film was exceptional worthy of trust that both the journey and destination would be enjoyable and it absolutely did not disappoint. Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a gentle soul a quiet  young boy obsessed with zombies and scary movies who just happens to see and speak with all the ghosts lingering in the world around him. No one else can see these ghosts and his family is concerned with his ""delusions"" especially when he claims to be able to see his deceased grandmother. Norman is struggling in school with only one friend Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) and though he tries to make the best of it its obvious that he feels like an outsider and a weirdo. With his special gifts Norman finds himself grappling with a centuries-old witches curse and when things go wrong hes suddenly faced with zombies witches and ghosts aplenty that wreak havoc on his small town. With the help of his annoying teenage sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) Neil Neils dopey brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) and the town bully (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) Norman sets out to undo the witchs curse though he may be far too late. Also check out Christopher Mintz-Plasse on Zombies and the Wisdom of Sequels ""ParaNorman"" is a 3-D stop-motion animated film from the studio that produced ""Coraline"" and both adventurous children and adults will find plenty to love here. The subject matter is a tad frightening from the fleshy zombies and howling witches to the occasionally spooky ghosts but any chill factor that ""ParaNorman"" might possess is tempered heavily with the humor and confidence of the script. The movie might draw comparisons to Tim Burton but where Burton veers hard into the bizarre and often eccentric ""ParaNorman"" is beautiful carefully and intentionally crafted with obvious love and attention to detail. From the tiniest nuances of facial expressions to the very different visual world unlike anything Id ever seen before ParaNorman is so completely different so fantastical and charming thoroughly wild at heart and very weird on top. The script is hilarious and heartfelt; From Normans sullen sadness to Neils bubbly simplicity the Valley girl-esque performance of sister Courtney and the slack-jawed lump that is Mitch these characters and many more set fire to the idea that animated characters cant portray real truths about the human experience. Weve all felt like Norman at times and the film touches on our shared experiences remarkably well. And this is what makes ""ParaNorman"" more than just another meaningful animated film what makes it exceptional  the thoughtful pairing of every element. Jon Brions score is moving and memorable the look of Normans world is magnificent and the story isnt marked by pandering stupidity or by trying to appeal to only children or only adults. Norman is different but he isnt choosing to be different. He simply accepts his gifts and is confused that other people are disturbed by him. It is often our differences and the particulars of who we are that allow us to ease ourselves (and others) out of the mire of doubt and sadness in which we so easily become ensnared. ""ParaNorman"" is a deeply moving film from the pleasure that a beautiful image can bring to the joy to be found in a highly original and wonderfully composed story. In a year marked by sequels and rehashed films that merely felt adequate ""ParaNorman"" took a huge risk on a scarier concept and it paid off enormously. See it and then go see it again.

""ParaNorman"" has all the ingredients of a childrens film albeit a spooky one Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee ""The Road"") is the laughingstock of Blithe Hollow a tourist trap with a Salem-like past. Hes taunted by the school bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and even his parents (Leslie Mann and Jeff Garlin) seem embarrassed by his behavior. In the middle of the school play Norman begins screaming ""The dead are coming"" When that warning comes true ""Para-Norman"" starts having fun with horror-movie conventions Normans motley group of survivors includes his teenage sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick); dumb hunky Mitch (Casey Affleck); and chubby Neil (Tucker Albrizzi). But ""ParaNorman"" also becomes something close to an actual horror movie. Its central mystery involves a centuries-old killing with harrowing implications and the climactic sequence has a visual and emotional intensity that even adults might find overwhelming. A lighter comedic touch might have helped as would more appealing characters The townsfolk are so uniformly misshapen (Mitchs flat-top cuts off most of his skull) that they dont look much better than the zombies. ""ParaNorman"" is never less than entertaining but youll have to follow it into a strange purgatory between two opposing genres.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 17 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Aug. 20 2012 1004AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Sam Fell and Chris Butler Written by Chris Butler Starring Kodi Smit-McPhee Anna Kendrick Casey Affleck Classification PG Country USA Language English Norman a spiky-haired boy of 11 has good reason to converse with the dead - theyre so much nicer and more available than the living. By night he chats up his beloved old granny long deceased but still a companionable sort. By day walking to school along the streets of Blithe Hollow he greets the friendly ghosts of the dear departed who greet him affably in turn. Yet inevitably upon reaching his destination Norman is the ""freak"" bullied and ostracized and otherwise degraded by the alive-and-well crowd. Such is the outcast fate of most heroes in the best childrens tales. And ParaNorman a ghoulishly delightful exercise in stop-motion animation is a very good childrens tale indeed. Watch ParaNorman official trailer But beware its not for the faint of heart Kids should exercise extreme caution in only choosing adults mature enough to accompany them. Thats because the co-directors here are Brits with a wry sense of humour a Grimm faith in the need of the young to confront the darker corners of their imagination and a politically incorrect fondness for unpalatable truths.When Norman finds a buddy in the chubby and similarly persecuted Neil his new friend extends him no sympathy but does offer a little advice ""You cant stop bullying - its part of human nature.""In fact the perils of human nature have a rich history in this New England town. Three centuries back witches were burned at the stake for the sin of non-conformity and their curse on the place is rumoured to linger. You can see where this is heading. However before it gets there our boy hero must contend with the corpse of his eccentric uncle freshly felled by a heart attack and clutching a tome that may reveal the secret of the witches curse. Okay kids this is the bit that will test your parents mettle Darned if Norman isnt obliged to ply the book from the mans cold dead and extremely inelastic hands After that scene the zombies are a walk in the graveyard.Yes a septet of zombies remnants of the intolerant Puritans who were the bullies of their time. The seven may look gruesome but in a nifty reversal theyre the fraidy cats now terrified of cellphone modernity and even more of their contemporary counterparts - the big-assed mob (the Brits love to sculpt the Yanks jumbo-sized) gathered at the town hall with blood on their mind.Naturally being well-acquainted with the dead Norman (the voice of Kodi Smit-McPhee) seizes the chance to shine. His small posse includes Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) and their respective older siblings - sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) with her shallow desires and raging hormones; brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) with those bulging muscles hiding his own secret. En route the directors working at the same studio that made Coraline prove themselves superb technicians in the stop-motion medium - the camera angles are as complex as live action; the 3-D add-on is organic and understated; and when the action gets heated the special effects live up to their name. If the story lacks the consistent psychological depth of Coraline another tale of an outcast finding solace in a parallel world amends are made during the lovely climax.Thats where Norman meets his 18th-century equivalent in Aggie who at an equally tender age was subjected to a rather more extreme form of bullying - branded a witch set ablaze by people whose fearful nature led them to ""punish imagination and difference."" Wrapped in a shroud of red light Aggies innocence is palpable and so is her anger. ""They hurt me"" she wails her perplexed surprise as raw now as then. Norman nods in understanding yet his reply doubles as an interrogation and the question mark echoes across all the witch hunts through all the generations ""So you hurt them back?""In those five childlike and questioning monosyllables theres so much going on. Vengeance is vying with wisdom the Old Testament is bumping up against the New normal and para are struggling to fuse - but of course no answer comes. Perhaps if we adults ever grow up it will.

Photo Courtesy of Wild Sentry If you were as underwhelmed by the last couple of Pixar features as I was try the spectacular-looking ""ParaNorman which marries Pixars formerly sophisticated storytelling style to the mordant wit of Tim Burtons animated projects. Like Burton and the geniuses at Aardman Animations this latest production from the studio behind the wonderful ""Coraline employs stop-motion animation to provide hand-crafted appeal to the clever and surprisingly scary story of a Massachusetts town whose witch-hunting past catches up with it on its 300th anniversary. At first the problem in Blithe Hollow is apparent only to Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) an 11-year-old misfit and horror-film fanatic who sees dead people including his grandmother (Elaine Stritch) with whom he converses daily. Normans parents (Jeff Garlin Leslie Mann) are understandably worried even before the ghost of dads newly deceased black-sheep brother (John Goodman) emerges from a toilet and advises Norman to take action before the spirits of seven town founders -- who condemned a girl accused of witchcraft to hanging -- rise from their graves. Indicative of this films deliciously twisted humor is a darkly hilarious scene in which Norman must pry a book from the cold dead hands of his uncle in an attempt to avert a night of the living Pilgrim dead. Theres lots more where that came from plus a motley assortment of allies who Norman recruits to help with his quest his pissed-off teenage sister (Anna Kendrick); a chubby classmate (Tucker Albrizzi); the classmatess jock older brother (Casey Affleck); and the school bully (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Even when the situations seem familiar writer Chris Butler (who co-directed with Sam Fell) spins them with countless small details. Theres also a subtle political message about fear impeding empathy -- and a casual curtain line from the jock brother thats positively subversive in the context of a movie aimed at families. Dont even think of taking a child under 5 to this one and you might raise that to 7 or 8 if your kid is especially sensitive. The film makes the animated ""Monster House look positively benign. ""ParaNorman is probably the years most visually dazzling movie so far and the stunning climax centering on an 11-year-old witch (Jodelle Ferland) is too good to spoil. Lets just say this is the first movie this year that warrants a 3-D surcharge.

Starring Leslie Mann Anna Kendrick Christopher Mintz-Plasse John Goodman Casey Affleck Kodi Smit-McPhee Bernard Hill Jeff Garlin Tempestt Bledsoe Elaine Stritch Director Chris Butler Sam Fell Running time 133 Release Opened Aug 17 2012  Editorial Review Middle school and zombies? AwwwkwardBy Sean OConnellFriday August 17 2012""I see dead people."" Thirteen years have passed (almost to the day) since young Haley Joel Osment whispered his confession to a stunned Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense"" sending chills down our collective spines. But what if the supernatural premise behind M. Night Shyamalans ghostly thriller inspired monstrous laughs instead of scares? Then youd have ""ParaNorman"" a colorfully macabre stop-motion animation comedy that embraces the sociopolitical allegories of George A. Romeros zombie pictures and reworks them into a feature-length episode of ""Scooby-Doo."" ""ParaNorman"" creeps and crawls out of the mind of writer/co-director Chris Butler a storyboard artist who honed his skills on Tim Burtons ""Corpse Bride"" and Henry Selicks ""Coraline."" Its no wonder then that when Butler receives free rein to tell his own story he comes up with a spooky creature-infested campfire story laced with valuable lessons about teamwork responsibility courage and the celebration of our inner outcast. That last trait is personified by Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) a quiet and unassuming middle-schooler who happens to be able to converse with the dead. On his daily walk to school Norman interacts with long-dead gangsters wearing concrete shoes a parachuted pilot hanging in a tree and a crushed animal the rest of us would recognize as roadkill. These restless spirits are far kinder to Norman though than the school bullies -- led by a pea-brained ox named Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) -- who ostracize our hero simply because hes different. Even casual moviegoers understand that something larger has to threaten Normans semi-peaceful existence giving him the opportunity to apply his precious gift and save the day. In the case of ""ParaNorman"" we learn of a centuries-old curse cast by disgruntled witch Aggie (Jodelle Ferland) against the heretics in Normans town. For years the witchs spell had been kept at bay by Normans crazy uncle (John Goodman). But when he mysteriously passes away its up to Norman his perturbed older sister (Anna Kendrick) and his mild-mannered best friend (Tucker Albrizzi) to quell a zombie uprising and grant Aggie her final wish. Two passions drive Butler and his co-director Sam Fell. The first is stop-motion animation a painstaking creative process thats arduous for the animators -- a three-minute sequence can take up to a year to film -- but ensures that each scene is carefully considered as its constructed. Rarely does one find trim-worthy fat in a stop-motion film. Butler and Fells other passion however is horror and they arent afraid to invigorate their animated adventure with unnerving nods to the gory genre. After a creaky start ""ParaNorman"" comes to life once the dead rise. Zombies stomp trees throw dagger branches purple-faced clouds loom and this roller-coaster ride through an expertly crafted house of terrors culminates with an unfortunately busy finale where Norman confronts Aggie the misunderstood witch. Too scary for the youngest in your family? Probably. Parents proceed with caution. ""ParaNorman"" in fact belongs on the short list of animated fables that aim most of their messages at grown-ups rather than kids. Adults will cheer Normans mature effort to accept his supernatural heritage. Theyll jeer Mintz-Plasses bully and chuckle at a brainless quarterback (Casey Affleck) with a secret to keep. And theyll nod solemnly during a telling scene near the end of ""ParaNorman"" where the zombies lurch through Normans town absorb examples of our societys mind-numbing pop culture and cower in fear. Because in ""ParaNorman"" the real monsters often look an awful lot like us. Contains scary action and images thematic elements some rude humor and language.

Too bad the movie doesnt have special powers too.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune August 16 2012 -- 540pm Focus Features Star Tribune Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) in ""Paranorman"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Humor depends on character context and continuity none of which is in abundant supply in ""ParaNorman."" The item in question is an occult-themed kiddie movie that aims for a Tim Burtonesque blend of giggles and chills missing both by a long shot. It has some elements of graphic interest. The opening and end titles are treasure troves of retro-spooky typefaces and the action in between is filmed in funky stop-motion. What is missing are the plot and personalities that would make us care. Also jokes. OK heavy sigh the setup Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a regular kid with extrasensory powers. He can see and hear the spirits who inhabit his old New England town. The dead people range from his kindly grandma (Elaine Stritch) to a flock of zombies raised by a vengeful child witch who is still steamed about that whole burning-at-the-stake thing Blithe Hollows settlers used to do. Norman doesnt do so well at making living breathing friends but his connection to the other side is the towns only hope as a curse settles in. The humor is as subtle as a skeletons elbow in the ribs. Grade-school wordplay dog-butt silliness ridiculously extended death scenes played for laughs (Normans oddball uncle voiced by John Goodman takes forever and a day to expire). The mind of a kid who would laugh at the Blithe Hollow tourist billboard featuring a witch in a noose and the motto ""A great place to hang"" is beyond contemplation. There is a smattering of cleverness. Grandma remains addicted to TV even in death. The ultra-hunky teen love interest for Normans older sister is not the stereotypical jock he appears to be. The finale is a lollapalooza of kinetic animated mayhem. But the story lacks a consistent sense of tension and the characterizations are tapioca-bland (ditzy cheerleader clueless dad pushy police chief stock bully). The whole thing lumbers worse than the zombies.

Credit ... more Photo Laika Inc. Focus Features ParaNorman review Breathtaking visuals 1 / 4 Back to Gallery ParaNorman Animated zombie comedy. Directed by Sam Fell and Chris Butler. With Kodi Smit-McPhee John Goodman. (PG. 93 minutes.) Zombies are people too. They may be ugly dead slow-moving inarticulate and easily dismembered but dont judge them too harshly OK? You dont want them to feel misunderstood. The same goes for witches. That more or less is the message of ""ParaNorman"" a visually breathtaking 3-D stop-motion fantasy from Laika the studio that made ""Coraline."" It tells the tale of Blithe Hollow a tiny New England town with a less-than-blithe history modeled it seems on the Salem witch trials. About 300 years ago a young witch was sentenced to death by hanging - but in her last breaths she managed to fire off a nice long-winded curse directed at her seven stone-faced accusers something about dying horrible deaths and being ""doomed to an eternity of damnation."" Meanwhile back in 2012 young Norman (voiced by the preternaturally wise Kodi Smit-McPhee) sees dead people. He blabs with them too - watching grainy horror films on the tube with his long-gone grandma (Elaine Stritch) greeting assorted spectral outcasts on his morning walk. Fate intervenes in the form of his stinky old uncle (John Goodman) who warns Norman of a looming town-wide zombiepocalypse and exhorts the boy to soothe the ghost of the angry witch. It aint that simple of course. Seven Puritan zombies do manage to rise limp around town freak out a sizable mob and lose track of a decomposing limb or two along the way. Norman does what he can zipping back and forth to an ancient wooded graveyard with the occasional aid - or something - of his zaftig buddy Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) his moronic sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) the equally moronic bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Neils mondo-moronic brother Mitch (Casey Affleck). Mitch takes part in the movies best gotcha moment right at the end. (Spoiler alert Yes the dude survives.) Directed by Sam Fell (a co-director on ""Flushed Away"") and Chris Butler ""ParaNorman"" features several memorable moments including one of the best and most repulsive toilet scenes since ""Trainspotting."" But its the look of the film that truly beguiles A seamless fusion of old-style stop-motion and CG effects the visuals have a heft depth and charm so often lacking in fully digitized movies. The world of Blithe Hollow exists in real space. The residents have real bags under their eyes real bellies at their belt buckles. Ugliness alternates with rapturous beauty The witch when she rises in the night sky appears as a twister of satiny ribbons. As for Butlers screenplay its less beguiling than preachy. And despite the supernatural parallels ""ParaNorman"" isnt nearly as creepy - or as magnificent - as ""Coraline"" a gorgeous and unsettling masterwork that plumbed childhood fears with a hypnotizing grace. The lesson in that if there was one Kids dont take your parents for granted. At least theyre people. Amy Biancolli is a film critic for Hearst Newspapers.

"Review ParaNorman runs amok with paranormal activity - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview ParaNorman runs amok with paranormal activityA spooky twist on outsider kids sad tale the stop-motion animated film is family-friendly and fun even with all the ghosts and zombies.August 16 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) searches Mr. Prenderghasts... (Focus Features / LAIKA Inc....)Like the undead animated movies are best when theyre under control. ""ParaNorman""a dark and slightly dotty 3-D fable about a boy who communes with the dearly and not so dearly departed sometimes gets a little out of hand especially at the end. Even so it may be the most fun youll have with ghosts and zombies all year. Its a spooky twist on the typical outsider kids tale of woe. Directed by Sam Fell and Chris Butler from Butlers scattershot script the stop-motion film centers on Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) a bookish 11-year-old and one of the main targets for the schools nose-picking bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). At home Norman is loved but misunderstood. His bombastic dad (Jeff Garlin) is forever booming about his conversations with ""ghosts."" His loopy mom (Leslie Mann) is certain its only a phase. And his teenage sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) basically cant be bothered with her irritating little brother. Normans solace is watching scary movies on TV with his grandmother (Elaine Stritch). The problem at least for Dad is that Grandma passed away last year. Its not all that surprising that no one believes Norman can really talk to the dead except for his weird Uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) a and of course the dead who turn up everywhere in Blithe Hollow a tourist trap whose claim to fame is a legendary witch hunt that happened 300 years ago. A giant statue of the captured old crone complete with pointed hat and warted nose graces the town square. Main street shops specialize in black-arts tchotchkes. Even the annual school play is a reenactment of the trial and hanging of the witch.PHOTOS. Too creepy for kids?Uncle Prenderghast tracks down Norman to tell him a crazy story about a curse cast by the old witch and an army of local zombies about to be on the loose. Then he promptly keels over leaving the grisly problem in Normans lap. Much running amok ensues. A great benefit of using stop-motion animation in a story like this is not only the way lines between the various realities can be blurred but how the style of film itself evokes a kind of pop-up book fairy tale quality that beckons you inside. In this strange world all the creatures come to life in inventive ways with the modeling allowing for a level of sculpted detail that is harder to achieve in more traditional animation styles. The ghosts are a bit wispier than the town folks and frankly for the most part a friendlier bunch. There are a series of stunning sequences as Norman falls into occasional trances in which scary end-of-Blithe Hollow premonitions play out in his mind. The zombies themselves are more fun than fearful especially the judges who condemned the witch to death truly a bunch of breakout boogeymen. The animators are clearly having a good time as the undead lose and retrieve bits of their decaying bodies along the way and that mood is infectious. There are some zombie rampages that might be scary for little ones and go on too long for kids of all ages but all in all its family-friendly.PHOTOS tHE wALKING dEAD AND THE BUSINESS OF ZOMBIESFell is an animation veteran having co-directed the delightful ""Flushed Away"" in 2006 and the somewhat less delightful ""The Tale of Despereaux"" in 2008. Butler is making his directing and writing debut after time in the artistic trenches including work on ""Coraline""filmmaker Henry Selicks stop-motion adaptation of the childrens story (it was nominated for an Oscar in 2010). That experience keeps the animation top notch. Things derail a bit near the end when the filmmakers start throwing in a few too many ""morals to this story."" And the final showdown between the town folk and the zombie rampage is a little too graphic for comfort. The story is at its best when it relaxes into quirky riffs on kids problems and zany zombies. There are amusing jabs at familiar stereotypes the best found among Normans band of unlikely allies A new friend named Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) a sweet fat kid who is another favorite target for bullying. And Neils buff but not too bright brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) is a hoot. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOscars 2013 Stop-motion dominates animated feature categoryJanuary 10 2013ParaNorman costume designs no small effortAugust 19 2012ParaNorman The Awakening put ghost images on movie...August 15 2012On the Set ParaNorman in a wacky world of its ownApril 29 2012The Pirates Band of Misfits helps stop-motion endureApril 26 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-paranorman-20120817,0,5981084.story",200,paranorman11,paranorman,latimes

Its an important message but is delivered rather clumsily.ParaNorman is set in the town of Blithe Hollow site of a famous witch hunt 300 years ago and now a tourist attraction.About the movieParaNorman out of fourStars Kodi Smit-McPhee Anna Kendrick Christopher Mintz-Plasse Leslie Mann Jeff Garlin Elaine Stritch Director Chris Butler and Sam FellDistributor Focus Features Rating PG for scary action and images thematic elements some rude humor and language Running time 1 hour 33 minutes Opens Friday nationwideLocal 11-year-old Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is more comfortable chatting up ghostly denizens -- from the guy who committed suicide down the street to a squirrel run over by a car -- than real people.Even his parents (Jeff Garlin and Leslie Mann) are put off by their sons obsession with the dead which includes a daily dose of zombie movies and volumes of ghostly lore. When he insists that his beloved deceased grandmother (Elaine Stritch) is watching TV with him his father blows up his mother wrings her hands and his teenage sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) dismisses him with an eye roll or three.The film cleverly pokes fun at deathly cliches ""Grandmas in a better place"" his mom tells him. ""In the living room?"" Norman quips. Hes a likable cheeky lad. But at school Norman is a social pariah bullied by the obnoxious Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). The closest thing Norman has to a friend is the insistently cheerful Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) who is bullied for his chubbiness.Norman has almost given up trying to understand the living. But his sense of isolation is jarred when hes contacted by his cranky uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) who tells him the witchs curse of town lore is real and about to come to fruition. Only Norman can stop it from harming the local citizenry. When a half-dozen zombies rise from their graves Norman Neil Courtney Alvin and Alvins older brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) race wildly against time to save the town. Bully and bullied come together as do the living -- dead and undead.This wryly funny take on the classic ghost story with its tributes to horror thrillers from Halloween to Friday the 13th and rich cast of characters has distinctive Tim Burton-esque visuals and a welcome dearth of potty humor. However a scene featuring the demise of Normans uncle might be too terrifying for those under 8.ParaNorman is a modestly charming frightfest that sings the praises of forgiveness in a way that might go over young heads but the attempt is certainly worth the effort.

LAIKA/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption LAIKA/Focus Features ParaNorman Directors Chris Butler Sam Fell Genre Animation Adventure Running Time 93 minutes Rated PG for scary action and images thematic elements some rude humor and language With Kodi Smit-McPhee Tucker Albrizzi Anna Kendrick Casey Affleck Christopher Mintz-Plasse Leslie Mann Jeff Garlin Watch Clips Bub Bub Credit Focus Features Unfinished Business Unfinished Business Credit Focus Features Uh-Oh Uh-Oh Credit Focus Features Even if most fans of hand-drawn animation have made peace to a degree with digital technology the pleasures of old-school stop-motion animation are still rare and precious. Theres something elemental about watching a movie thats been made by moving small figures around and filming them frame by frame; even though theres always some digital technology involved in the making of a contemporary stop-motion film the human touch always sings through the finished product. Thats certainly the case with Sam Fell and Chris Butlers ParaNorman the story of a misfit New England kid who hears the voices of the dead -- and who finds himself having to appease a group of zombies who in their incarnation as human beings some 300 years ago were responsible for sentencing a young ""witch"" to death. Norman (whose voice is provided by Kodi Smit-McPhee) feels out of place everywhere At school hes tormented by brainless oversized bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse aka McLovin). At home his bubblehead sister (Anna Kendrick) wants nothing to do with him and his father (Jeff Garlin) grouses about Normans love for zombie movies and the fact that he insists he can communicate with his dead grandmother voiced by Elaine Stritch; Norman can see her as we can sitting grouchily on the family sofa working away at a piece of knitting. Normans mom (Leslie Mann) feebly tries to defend her son claiming that hes ""sensitive."" Dad is having none of it "" Sensitive is writing poetry and being bad at team sports"" he claims. In his eyes Norman is something worse than a sensitive kid Hes a weirdo. Norman it turns out has the ability to save his town even if its miserable insecure inhabitants dont exactly deserve saving. Of course youve heard this one before The story ParaNorman tells isnt a new one and it doesnt have to be. (Butler in addition to co-directing wrote the script.) But the movie is packed with too many characters and weighed down by superfluous plot details -- the storytelling keeps wriggling out of Fell and Butlers grasp. That drains some of ParaNormans potentially supernatural powers; it isnt nearly as enjoyable as Henry Selicks 2009 shivery work of genius Coraline which like ParaNorman was produced by LAIKA a collective of filmmakers designers and animators working in 2-D computer-generated and stop-motion animation. (Butler served as a storyboard supervisor on Coraline.) i The zombies -- and an ancient witchs curse -- make the town a treacherous place for Norman and his family friends and enemies. LAIKA/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption LAIKA/Focus Features The zombies -- and an ancient witchs curse -- make the town a treacherous place for Norman and his family friends and enemies. LAIKA/Focus Features Yet in terms of its overall design and execution ParaNorman doesnt disappoint Even when the story goes all noodly theres always something to look at some detail or visual gag that tickles or delights. Norman is a beautifully designed character a wispy kid with wheat-grass hair and sugar-bowl ears -- he looks like an exceedingly depressed Jared Leto rendered in miniature. The bags under his eyes speak of heavy thoughts and sleepless nights; his special gifts are more like a sack o woe. The towns forefather-zombies are similarly sympathetic They limp through the streets looking for salvation not trouble dragging parts of their rotting carcasses behind them. Their eyeballs bulge; their mouths hang open helplessly. The living misunderstand them completely pursuing them with guns cutlery and even toilet plungers. Indeed as pleas for tolerance go ParaNorman is a wickedly funny one. And its climactic moment is both gorgeous and terrible a ghostly howl of disappointment and grief that thankfully settles into a shimmering translucent sense of peace and well-being. The spirit of great stop-motion animators like George Pal and Ray Harryhausen lives on in ParaNorman and not just as a ghost Its so real you could almost reach out and touch it.

Whats scary to one kid is cool to another. Hence ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Hunger Games"" battle for shelf space against ""Dora the Explorer"" and ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid.""""ParaNorman"" is a purposely creepy cartoon that encourages us to embrace our fears (literally). Its not warm and fuzzy but for kids who comprehended ""Coraline"" and babysitters who savored ""The Corpse Bride"" this stop-motion marvel from some of the same animators is like an early Halloween treat.Norman (voice of Codi Smit-McPhee) is one of those kids who loves horror stories. But hes not just a passive viewer of the creature features he watches on TV -- hes a co-star in his own version of ""The Sixth Sense."" To the disbelief of his parents (Jeff Garlin and Leslie Mann) and the disdain of his classmates Norman chats with his dead grandmother (Elaine Stritch) and on his walk to school he is greeted by generations of ghostly townsfolk. Norman lives in Blithe Hollow site of a 1712 witch trial and now a decrepit tourist trap. Every October the spirit of a persecuted witch grows restless and only Normans weird uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) knows how to calm her. As the old codger is dying he tries to bequeath the secret to Norman but it gets lost in translation.When the witching hour draws near and decomposing zombies rise from their graves Norman goes on a moonlight scavenger hunt to find the proper spell with his airhead sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick); his cheerful sidekick Neil (Tucker Albrizzi); and Neils jock brother Mitch (Casy Affleck) ""ParaNorman"" has plenty of rambunctious thrills to give the kiddies goosebumps while older connoisseurs of stop-motion animation will appreciate the Laika studios inventive visuals. All of the faces are asymmetrical -- even Normans -- and the backgrounds are crammed with jokey details that will reward repeated viewing. The candy apple on top of this devils food cake is a positive message about bullying but for a story so mired in morality ""ParaNorman"" is too lively to slow down and preach.PARANORMANThree and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 133  Content Scary images and themes Videos ParaNorman trailer Aug 16 2012 (...)

Decades of happily morbid classics from the minds of Charles Addams Edward Gorey and especially Tim Burton have allowed us to accept that maybe children should play with dead things at least when theyre brought to life with craft and creativity. Burtons ""Corpse Bride"" was the genres most recent high-water mark -- an unexpectedly soulful romance that worked for audiences of all ages. ""ParaNorman"" is supposedly for kids but its really aimed at their snarky older brothers and it illustrates the limits of the new family creepshows. The movie comes from Laika Entertainment the Portland Ore.-based stop-motion animation studio that made the far superior ""Coraline"" (2009); as a work of painstaking craftsmanship ""ParaNorman is unassailable maybe even awe-inspiring. And its about a little boy who sees dead people. Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) lives in Blithe Hollow a placid suburban town with a curse left over from the Puritan days -- think a Tinkertoy version of Salem. His gift for seeing ghosts is comforting when its his deceased grandma (Elaine Stritch) or the familiar spooks around the neighborhood but Normans mother (Leslie Mann) father (Jeff Garlin) and mall-brat sister (Anna Kendrick) are unable to cope with the kids talent and the hulking school bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has it in for him. Normans a sad little boy and for good reason -- almost everyone else in the movie is hateful. ""ParaNorman"" is the story of what happens when the heros eccentric uncle (John Goodman) dies -- cue the rigor mortis slapstick -- and leaves Norman in charge of stopping the towns curse. This involves keeping the zombie-fied remains of a group of 17th-century judges from emerging out of their graves while dissuading the witch they executed from unleashing the apocalypse. (Is there any movie made these days that doesnt involve the end of the world?) The movie has its moments of dark whimsy and cheeky wit but most of what it has is body parts. ""ParaNorman"" is rated PG and is being sold as a gruesome but essentially high-spirited family-friendly romp. I suppose thats true if you dont mind your 6-year-old put into clinical shock by the sight of slavering dismembered creatures coming at them in 3-D. And those are the good guys. In a self-consciously clever irony the zombie judges are set upon by the narrow-minded townsfolk of Blithe Hollow with torches shotguns and random household appliances the sheeplike stupidity of the living in sharp contrast to the charmingly decomposing dead. The last thing we need are kiddie films that harp unrealistically on sweetness and light but ""ParaNorman"" swings so far to the other extreme that its a little depressing. But hey you know your children. If theyre older and thick-skinned give it a go. If they scare easy by all that is holy stay away. On a technical level the film represents an advance from traditional stop-motion materials (clay and foam) to a new generation of 3-D printers used to create a broader range of facial expressiveness. What this means visually is that the world of ""ParaNorman"" has a vague post-modern Mr. Potato Head feel to it -- a look that is novel and sometimes breathtaking in its details but more often cluttered and inelegant. Like much else here it suggests that the gifted artisans at Laika dove so deeply into the making of this movie that they forgot who they were making it for. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

(AP Photo/Focus Features) By Jake Coyle Posted 08/16/12 1201 AM EDT | Updated on 08/16/2012  Comments LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The stop-motion animated ""ParaNorman"" unfolds tragically So much drawing for such an unworthy script. The labor necessary to create a film like ""ParaNorman"" is colossal. Tens of thousands of facial expressions were drawn. 3-D printers (a new advancement in stop motion pioneered here) ran through 3.8 metric tons of printer powder. One scene alone took a year to shoot. So its tempting to applaud the 3-D ""ParaNorman"" politely sympathetically simply because of the admirable work. No one wants to tell 60 puppet makers that their months of toil were ill spent. But though ""ParaNorman"" is impressively crafted the frequently wondrous and whimsical visuals far surpass the disappointingly slipshod story of an 11-year-old boy named Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) who can see and speak to the dead. Advertisement While stop-motion animation has largely gone out of favor with the rise of computer animation the Portland-based studio LAIKA has carried the flame. The studio which is owned by Nike founder Phil Knight and run by his son Travis Knight (a producer on ""ParaNorman"") previously made 2009s ""Coraline."" ""ParaNorman"" bears some of the same fantasy-horror spirit of ""Coraline"" which was based on Neil Gaimans novella. It also has some of the elements of the British studio Aardman Animations (""Wallace and Gromit""); ""ParaNorman"" is directed by Sam Fell (who co-directed Aardmans ""Flushed Away"") and Chris Butler who also wrote it. With a thick forest of rigidly spiked brown hair Norman appears as if in perpetual fright. But he greets the paranormal with casual familiarity talking to his grandmother (Elaine Stritch) while they watch TV and greeting invisible passersby while he walks down a seemingly empty street. Hes an avid horror film watcher with zombie posters in his bedroom and a cell phone ringtone of the ""Friday the 13th"" theme. His parents (Jeff Garlin Leslie Mann) and older sister (Anna Kendrick) have little patience for Normans eccentricities and the kids in school call him ""Abnorman"" and worse. Norman is contacted by his uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) who shares Normans gift. He tells him that the myth of their town Blithe Hollow -- that it was cursed by a witch 300 years ago -- is true and that its now Normans duty to keep her at bay with a ritual. Prederghast who promptly croaks also appears to Norman from the bowels of a school toilet. Its the scene that took a year to shoot and its when ""ParaNorman"" is at its best brilliantly textured comical and bizarre. After Norman fails in the ritual he and an improvised gang -- his round redhead friend Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) Neils hunky and dimwitted older brother (Casey Affleck) a bully who resembles the one that preyed on Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes (Alex Borstein) and Normans sister -- flee from a septet of zombies with much shrieking and plan making. The running around town takes up what feels like two thirds of the film robbing ""ParaNorman"" of pace and setting it on a tiresome and frantic trajectory before enough character development has taken place. Some awkward rhythm and poor sound design (outside of the score by Jon Brion) also prevent ""ParaNorman"" from the smoothness of a major studio animated film. The setup is promising and film has its charms -- Norman responds to a demand to ""swear"" with hesitance ""Like the F-word?"" -- but it never quite finds its tone and sometimes seems lucky to have avoided a PG-13 rating. ""ParaNorman"" blessed with otherworldly animation cant escape the demons of story. ""ParaNorman"" a Focus Features release is rated PG for scary action and images thematic elements some rude humor and language. Running time 92 minutes. Two stars out of four.

Comments click to enlarge ParaNorman Recommended Video Watch on Netflix Rated PG  93 minutes  2012 Norman sees dead people and his gift has turned him into the most bullied kid at his school. But when his New England town comes under a witchs curse hes the only person who can tangle with the netherworld. Produced by the Laika studio this swell stop-motion animation operates on a wavelength similar to that of Laikas debut feature Coraline (2009) with assured character comedy counterbalanced by a solemn sense of macabre wonder. The big-headed characters are cruelly often hilariously detailed from the purple lines in the palms of a fat disdainful teacher to the cloud of blemishes on the face of the school bully. Yet when Norman walks the streets of his town passing all manner of maimed and mutilated ex-people Jon Brions score is gentle even magical. Chris Butler wrote the script and codirected with Sam Fell; the voice talent includes Anna Kendrick Leslie Mann Jeff Garlin Casey Affleck and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. By J.R.

Area theaters. The 12-year-old boys who go to see ""ParaNorman"" -- and who are the only ones who might enjoy it -- should double up on the sugary treats to stay awake during this gorgeous-looking but zombi-fied stop-motion animated creep show. Its as slow as a corpse and half as interesting. The titular 11-year-old boy is Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) the ""weird"" kid in town who has the gift of seeing dead people -- as well as dead dogs raccoons and birds -- around his downtrodden neighborhood in Blithe Hollow Mass. The burgs slapdash witchy tourism industry is built around a witch who was killed 300 years ago. However the witchs restless spirit isnt appeased by the towns annual ritual and Norman learns from his scraggly psychic uncle (John Goodman) that shes about to bring the dead to life. Yet no matter how hard Norman tries to convince his mom and dad (Jeff Garlin Leslie Mann) his sister (Anna Kendrick) and his friend Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) they doubt him -- until seven decaying bodies start roaming through town. Like ""Coraline"" ""ParaNorman"" is a project from the stop-motion animation firm LAIKA. Shadows of that movie hangs over ""ParaNorman"" but it lacks originality. Far from being oddballs guys who love monsters pretty much own pop culture these days. The movie also isnt as young-kid-friendly as it seems. Audiences under age 9 may not appreciate the goofy but icky jolts. The sensitive voice turn by Smit-McPhee (""Let Me In"" ""The Road"") and the evocative visual details are indeed haunting. They might have been memorable with sharper pacing a Burton-esque showmanship and maybe a release date around Halloween. You dont need a sixth sense to see the logic in that.

With the delightfully offbeat zombie flick ""ParaNorman"" the plucky studio Laika is staking a bold claim in the crowded animation market.Its building a unique reputation by taking glorious old-school animation technology -- stop-motion -- and gussying it up with smartly deployed 3-D using it to enhance rather than distract. The impressive Oregon-based company has produced another macabre winner to follow its ingeniously twisted first full-length feature 2009s ""Coraline."" Like that creepy flick this one has some real edge to it; the material may be unsuitable for little tykes who could encounter nightmares from the comic mayhem and zombies.For older kids and adults though this is an utter delight -- beautifully conceived executed and acted. ""ParaNorman"" -- about a bullied middle-schooler named Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) a kid who sees dead people and contends with the undead and a wee witch with anger management issues -- doesnt entirely possess the same innovative streak as ""Coraline"" but it sometimes comes close. The comic ode to horror flicks is a breath of fresh air in the normally stale movie days of mid-August and it stands out as one of the best animated features so far this year. Advertisement Directors Sam Fell (""Flushed Away"") and Chris Butler who also wrote the screenplay and a team of animators have gone to meticulous lengths to cook up a captivating and off-kilter world. Theyve done such a richly detailed job of it that even the down-on-its-heels town of Blithe Hollow -- which flailingly hopes to capitalize on its historical indiscretions by making the entire downtown witch-themed -- practically pulsates with life. Other smaller details deliver big storytelling payoffs the dingy corridors of a middle school; Normans well-used comic-book-stuffed backpack; the crazily fit body of Mitch (Casey Affleck); and the garish pink get-up worn by Normans self-involved sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick).The attention to detail extends to all the quirky characters including Normans chunky friend Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) whos also bullied; the insufferably dramatic teacher Mrs. Henscher (Alex Borstein); the seemingly cuckoo Uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman); and the insecure bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). But dont be fooled into assuming that ""ParaNorman"" is all about the visuals. It delivers a potent multipronged fable that touches on meaty themes from bullying to dealing with death. It also delivers an especially resonant message about not succumbing to a cult of fear.Thats an awful lot to stuff into a story about a boy who tries to save his town from a witchs curse but Butlers screenplay never allows the narrative to go astray or become preachy. He effortlessly shows Normans rite of passage from being ostracized to being accepted in his town. At times that journey becomes touching with a finale that is particularly moving.The central theme about embracing each others differences is hardly new but ""ParaNorman"" employs it in a very effective and visually captivating manner -- playing it out beyond typical pat and easy resolutions.For that reason and many more I cant wait to see what Laika has cooking up next for us.ParaNorman    Rating PG (for scary action and images thematic elements some rude humor and language)Cast Kodi Smit-McPhee Casey Affleck Anna Kendrick Christopher Mintz-Plasse Tucker Albrizzi John Goodman and Leslie MannDirectors Sam Fell and Chris ButlerRunning time 1 hour 33 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"ParaNorman review Ghouls rule | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesParaNorman review Ghouls ruleStop-motion animation ParaNorman made by Coraline animators.ParaNorman is a visual delight with a few ghoulish scares.  (Alliance Films)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Aug. 16 2012ParaNorman(out of 4)Starring the voices of Kodi Smit-McPhee Tucker Albrizzi Anna Kendrick Casey Affleck and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Directed by Sam Fell and Chris Butler. 85 minutes. Opens Aug. 17 at major theatres. PGHe sees dead people.And thats one of many talents Norman the low-key hero of the gruesome and glorious stop-motion animation ParaNorman possesses.Article Continued BelowMade by Oregon-based animators LAIKA the fertile minds who created the Oscar-nominated Coraline and directed by Sam Fell and Chris Butler from a story penned by Butler (who also worked on The Corpse Bride) ParaNorman is about much more than a kid who has a sixth sense.As with Coraline be prepared for more than a few ghoulish scares and sinister goings-on amid the laughs and stunning stop-motion effects that brings the cast of fully realized characters to life despite their cartoonish over-the-top physical exaggerations.Hedgehog-haired Norman (voiced by Let Me Ins Kodi Smit-McPhee) loves to watch zombie flicks with a bowl of popcorn at his feet and the ghost of his dead grandmother (Elaine Stritch) asking for plot updates while she sits knitting on the couch.His parents arent fans of Normans undead obsessions both real and cinematic. Same goes for his vapid social-media maniac older sister Courtney (voiced by Anna Kendrick) who rates him slightly above pond scum and the school bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who delights in torturing him. But Normans passions dovetail with his surroundings considering they live in Blithe Hollow the site of a famous witch trial 300 years before that didnt end so well for the witch.Normans only pal -- and hes not too thrilled with that -- is chubby nerd Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) a playground philosopher who has much to teach Norman if only hell pay attention.But Norman has other things on his mind. First he has to save the town from a curse levelled by the wronged witch at her trial or so claims his weird Uncle Penderghast (John Goodman). Uncle P is about to be listed in the ""undead"" column along with the intensely creepy judge and jurors who passed sentence on the hapless and perpetually unhappy witch three centuries before. Theyre due to rise from their graves and its not going to be pretty his uncle warns and were the witnesses to it.The quick-witted script and visual puns (check out Normans bedroom) make this a zombie movie for kids but one parents can enjoy. Good thing too since it will be very unsettling to some youngsters while others will lap it up. Parents will have to decide which side of the zombie fence their kids come down on but having a hand ready to hold is probably a good idea.With nods to everything from Ghostbusters to Scooby Doo ParaNorman is a visual delight that tells its story while avoiding the slick machine-milled look of so many animated offerings today. A scene in the school bathroom where a ghost grows restless is a delight although the climactic endgame drags on and suffers from too much moralizing that doesnt mesh with the quick-lipped fun thats gone before.The 3D effects that work well in some scenes like when making a menacing forest appear to thrust spiking branches into the audience only muddy the already muted palette in other instances.Its not the 3D that matters anyway. What makes ParaNorman so entertaining is its full-on embrace of fantasy and ghoulish delights. Theres no attempt at realism; this is pure imagination and the filmmakers want you to know it.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

ParaNorman (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review ParaNorman (PG) The stop-motion animation is the main draw in this not-so-spooky tale for kids. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/16/2012 Editor rating 2.5 ParaNorman is the second stop-motion animation movie from Laika Entertainment whose first film 2009s Coraline was a spooky scary wonder. On the surface the new picture is even more frightening replete with ghosts and zombies and monsters. The story is also more complicated Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an outcast nerd who loves horror movies and sees dead people like the ghost of his beloved grandma (Elaine Stritch) who remains perched in her favorite spot on the living room couch and talks to her grandson as if she were alive. Then an ancient curse cast on the town by a witch threatens to make the dead to rise from their graves turning Norman into a reluctant ghostbuster. A lot of ParaNorman which was directed by Chris Butler and Sam Fell relies on familiar formulas The crazy old coot (John Goodman) who may know a secret; Normans snotty older sister (Anna Kendrick) who constantly berates her little brother; his chubby best friend (Tucker Albrizzi); the school bully (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Unlike Coraline which focused intently on the childhood terror of suspecting your parents may not be who they seem to be the story of ParaNorman sprawls in a dozen directions. There are zombie attacks (mostly funny rarely scary) teenage antics (the kids drive around in a van that bears a faint resemblance to Scooby-Doos Mystery Machine) and a third-act revelation that changes the tone of the film from spooky to beautiful gentle tragedy. None of this is all that engaging. But the art design of the movie makes up for the slack story. Butler and Fell are diehard fans of the horror genre and they have peppered the film with an endless array of subtle homages and gags from scratchy VHS tapes of slasher flicks to aural cues of everything from Tubular Bells to the theme from Halloween. A lot of this stuff will sail over the heads of children who are without question the target audience (unlike Pixar movies this one doesnt offer much for grown-ups to chew on). The stop-motion animation combined with the angular design of the characters keeps the eyes entranced though. ParaNorman is a minor but memorable late entry into the summer movie season and even though its in 3D this one seems destined to find its true success on home video where children will probably want to watch it over and over -- and hide under their covers during the scarier parts.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Modern animated films often come in suspiciously similar batches that indicate studios are keeping a wise eye on the competition Antz and A Bugs Life were released in close proximity as were Finding Nemo and Shark Tale and Madagascar and The Wild. Fall 2012 features a similar pileup of macabre monster comedy cartoons each with their own worthy pedigree. But while Frankenweenie and Hotel Transylvania have big-name directors on their sides--Tim Burton and Samurai Jack/Dexters Laboratory creator Genndy Tartakovsky respectively--ParaNorman mostly earns high expectations because its the second stop-motion 3-D film from Laika the animation studio responsible for 2009s stellar Coraline. ParaNorman does boast Coralines CGI-smooth movement and attention to detail and ups the visual ante with new technology that allows for more variety in character design. And its Jon Brion score provides for more variety than the usual selection of pop hits. Nonetheless ParaNorman doesnt live up to Coralines thematically consistent propulsively nightmarish story. It plays with comedy and drama but keeps failing to commit to one or the other. Debuting co-director Chris Butler (partnered with Flushed Away and Tale Of Despereaux director Sam Fell) scripted the film and his story seems like something Coraline writer Neil Gaiman might dream up Zombie-obsessed horror-movie fan Norman (voiced by The Roads Kodi Smit-McPhee) can see and communicate with the dead which he does casually on a daily basis hanging out with his grandmothers ghost and what-upping the ubiquitous spirits haunting his hometown. But his gifts for getting along with the dead isolate him from the living. Though his entire town thrives around commercially exploiting an old legend about a witchs curse Normans normalcy-obsessed father (Jeff Garlin) and eye-rolling sister (Anna Kendrick) take a dim view of his belief in ghosts and lunkheaded bullies like Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse who could only play a hulking thug in an animated film) use his seeming imaginary friends as an excuse to pick on him. Then Normans crazed Uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) turns up to tell him that the witchs curse is real and Normans gift makes him responsible for keeping it at bay year after year. Before long Norman is facing eerie visions and actual zombies and chasing around town with an unlikely crew of misfits trying to break the curse. There are a dozen morals packed into ParaNorman which orders kids to believe in themselves and be themselves at any cost and lectures them on the wrongness of bullying moral self-righteousness and giving in to a mob mentality. Meanwhile Norman models responsible behavior by gamely fighting on behalf of the people who scorned him which is virtually everybody but his new buddy Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) the latest attempt to revitalize the archetypal fat nerd as an irrepressible good-natured bully-proof hero. (See also Super 8 and the Diary Of A Wimpy Kid movies.) But all the messages and winks at the audience whisk by at surface level without becoming organic parts of the story and the results feel overcrowded distracted and preachy. Meanwhile the film zips between melancholy and gross-out slapstick trying to mine tragedy from Normans isolation one moment and playing it for amusement in the next. Only the ending sequence which dives headlong into horror picks an idea and a tone and sticks with it. The results are breathtakingly chilling but its easy to wonder what heights ParaNorman could have reached by doing one thing that well throughout instead of 10 things at once haphazardly.

"Paranorman movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies ParaNorman is another boy with ghost trouble  Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips picks 10 movies you should look forward to this summer. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Heres the historical designation of the new animated film ""ParaNorman"" Its the third feature made in the painstaking stop-motion process -- consciously unrealistic herky-jerky and rough-hewn in the George Pal ""Puppetoons"" or Tim Burton ""Corpse Bride"" vein -- as well as in stereoscopic 3-D. The first two to do so were the very fine""Coraline"" and the noisy bustling""The Pirates Band of Misfits.""The other distinction worth noting In this summer of 2012 ""ParaNorman"" is one of the good movies. Though not up to the riches of ""Coraline"" also made by the folks at LAIKA Inc. an animation company in Hillsboro Ore. ""ParaNorman"" blends its strains of zombie movie tropes supernatural curses and stoical misunderstood preteens with a careful hand. Even when the component parts are familiar the treatment thereof feels newly observed and thoughtfully integrated. Lead animator and producer Travis Knight establishes a mood at once sinister and comic and allows the characters room to move around inside as they introduce us to the nooks and crannies of the Salem Mass.-styled town of Blithe Hollow. Young Norman has a vertical mini-forest of hair and two rectangular quizzical eyebrows. His home life is bordered by a harsh older sister a hot-tempered father and a loving but weary mother. Norman has the ""Sixth Sense"" problem He sees dead people one of them being his kindly grandmother floating around the family home. The grandmother is voiced by Broadway legend Elaine Stritch which gave me faint hopes of at least one rendition of Sondheims ""The Ladies Who Lunch."" DashedBullied at school Normans shadowed by his mysterious Mr. Prenderghast who is desperate to share a secret involving the towns witch-curse. ""ParaNorman"" morphs into a variation on the movies Norman loves specifically the undead-focused. Theres a sad story of another misunderstood preteen at the root of the curse and Norman must lead his own band of misfits on a quest to solve the riddle and save the town. The notion that witch-hunt and pack-animal persecution recur throughout human history gives ""ParaNorman"" its foundation. The notion that stray body parts acting alone and acting up are a solid source of visual slapstick gives the film its comic spark. Its too bad screenwriter and co-director Chris Butler (Sam Fell is the other director) larded the story with 21/2 action climaxes when one would do. The movie I think errs by going for the conventionally scary and bombastic Big Finish even though its a Melancholy Big Finish and therefore more intriguing than the average everyday ""Ice Age"" sequel Big Finish.What works about ""ParaNorman"" is its subtle interweave of the stoical and the heroic. The voice work is inspired without a lot of theatrical flourish. The low-key musical score by Jon Brion one of the years best teases out the macabre humor in each new challenge faced by Norman.For all their painstaking detail I never much took to the Tim Burton universe of stop-motion""The Nightmare Before Christmas""or ""Corpse Bride."" But ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" are several steps up in terms of ... well everything that makes a film successful and interesting. The stories seduce rather than bully. The throwaway gags are choice. (At one point in the zombie-invasion section of the film a three-second radio dispatch is heard ""Officials are urging people to panic and run."") And despite a heavy-going and not-great final 20 minutes ""ParaNorman"" gets you in Normans corner and keeps you there. And for a bonus the film offers the years funniest single joke involving a race between an incoming zombie and a vending machine dispensing a little too slowly a bag of chips.mjphillipstribune.com ParaNorman -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG (for scary action and images thematic elements some rude humor and language)Running time 133Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment ParaNorman (movie) Coraline (movie) Ghouls and Zombies (supernatural entities) Animation (genre) Tim Burton ParaNorman Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0814-paranorman-20120816,0,2076485.column",200,paranorman24,paranorman,chicagotribune

This weird and wonderful 3-D cartoon hides a moral about fear itself in a delightfully diabolical tale of witches ghosts and the walking dead Theres a fine line between scaring children and traumatizing them and its up to each parent to know how their own kids will react. I know of nine-year-olds who love ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" but I also recall my sister-in-law relating the tale of removing her screaming horrified toddler from the big-screen ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" movie. So while the chills and thrills of  ""ParaNorman"" might be enough to send some youngsters racing for the lobby tykes of the proper age and the right scare-minded sensibility will have a great time. So will adults with a taste for freaky fun whether theyre accompanying a kid or going on their own. Beautifully rendered in 3-D stop-motion animation the film combines ghoulishness and hilarity in a way that suggests ""Evil Dead 2"" for the Nickelodeon set. Young Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee of ""The Road"" and ""Let Me In"") lives in the town of Blithe Hollow whose main claim to fame is the trial and execution of a witch three centuries earlier. As reenacted by Normans school class the hideous hag cursed the judge and jurors to rise from their graves as punishment for killing her although thats become the sort of local legend that gets bandied about as an excuse for witch-themed casinos and burger joints. Even in this supernaturally-minded town Norman is an outsider because no one believes his claim that he can speak with the dead even though that ability provides him with plenty of conversational partners from Civil War vets to his grandmother (Elaine Stritch) to the run-over dog of Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) the chubby kid who as a fellow victim of school bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) becomes Normans only friend. Norman starts to have visions of the cursed Puritans returning as the walking dead and his somewhat deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) leaves him a book thats supposed to keep the Blithe Hollow witch at rest. So whether he wants to or not its up to Norman -- with the help of Neil Alvin Normans exasperated teen sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) and Neils muscle-headed brother Mitch (Casey Affleck with impeccable comic timing) -- to save the town. And along the way they may all discover that legends have a way of hiding historical truth. ""ParaNorman"" generates both laughs and yelps with its green-faced pilgrims staggering around Blithe Hollow and the local rubes forming unwieldy and violent mobs to deal with the situation. (Theres a bit involving a scared townie a shuffling zombie and a vending machine thats absolutely priceless.) The movie knows how to push kids gross-out buttons particularly in one scene of corpse slapstick in which Norman must wrest a volume from the hands of the rigor mortis-inflicted Mr. Prenderghast. But this is horror done right with suspense and surprise rather than gore and viscera. And speaking of surprises ""ParaNorman"" effectively works in a moral about how fear causes us to lash out at others putting the witchs tormentors in the same boat with Alvin and the trigger-happy townsfolk. It doesnt bludgeon you with its anti-bullying sentiment but the point is made all the same. Directors Sam Fell (the greatly underrated ""Flushed Away"") and Chris Butler create a look thats part eerie and autumnal and part childrens book and the character detail on the stop-motion models is nothing short of exquisite. (Stay through the credits for a peek at the work involved in creating just one of the characters.) As someone who grew up on endless matinee screenings of ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" and ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" Im a big fan of family-friendly horror that knows how to go just far enough on the spooky scale. The joyous goosebump-inducing ""ParaNorman"" will give your spine the best kind of tingle. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

ParaNorman Good Directors Chris Butler Sam Fell. Cast Kodi Smit-McPhee Anna Kendrick Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Rating Rated PG for scary action and images thematic elements some rude humor and language. Whats so enjoyable about the movie is how it doesnt skimp on the scary-movie details. Yes its stop-motion animation (created by the studio artists at LAIKA who made the equally spooky ""Coraline"") that kids should like but much of whats here will connect squarely with an older audience too. 10 scary films for kids adults | Goody 3 upcoming kid-friendly horror films For instance a kid is told he has to retrieve something from the hands of a corpse that has been ripening for a day or two inside an abandoned house. Surely they wont show the dead person right? Wrong. Directors Chris Butler and Sam Fell (Butler also wrote the script) make that rare leap They trust their audience young and old. They know kids dont shy from honest scares and they enjoy providing them plenty. Norman (voice of Kodi Smit-McPhee) like the kid in ""The Sixth Sense"" sees dead people. He also converses with them. It takes him forever to walk to school because hes so busy exchanging pleasantries with the ghosts that haunt Blithe Hollow a New England town whose economy evidently is based on a particularly nasty witch trial centuries before. Normans gift does not make him popular at home or at school. (His permanently standing-on-edge hair probably doesnt help either.) At home his mom (Leslie Mann) puts up with his talking to his dead grandmother (Elaine Stritch) but his father (Jeff Garlin) wants none of it. His sister (Anna Kendrick) also occasionally takes time away from talking on her cellphone to complain that Norman is a freak. Its worse at school where Norman is teased and bullied. Only tubby little Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) is nice to him but Norman is so used to abuse that he prefers being alone. The paranormal activity seems to be heating up in town and a weird old man (John Goodman) warns Norman that he too can see dead people -- and Norman needs to protect the town from an impending curse involving colonial-era zombies and a 300-year-old witch (Jodelle Ferland). Its all classic-horror stuff -- the outcast having to protect the town and his tormentors relying on the help of his sister his sort-of pal Neil Neils older brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) and bully Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) along with his parents. In that regard it sounds pretty standard a typical lessons-learned kids movie and in some respects it is. But ""ParaNorman"" goes deeper than that. The resolution involves issues of trust betrayal love and forgiveness. Truly this is one animated film that would work just as well as a live-action movie. All this and jokes about a ghost dogs butt. Which is to say its a nice balance between the funny the silly the scary and the moving. There are a few problems -- some of the business with the zombies didnt quite hold up for me. And although Normans exile from friends and family probably rings true its rather unpleasant to watch particularly for an extended period. But the look of the film is great -- its a beautiful homage to every zombie movie youve ever seen (and you will enjoy this movie a lot more if you have in fact seen zombie movies). The filmmakers give Blithe Hollow with its witch-themed stores billboards and hot-dog stands a unique feel. Its always getting dark or dark already there seems like -- just like in any horror movie worth its salt. ""ParaNorman"" is worth that and a lot more.

Obsessed with horror films to a degree that would have the local asylum readying a padded cell this introverted outsider is also able to communicate with the dead. Not that Norman can convince anyone around him of his ""talent."" Its clear as he shuffles his way through another day of disbelieving family members elementary-school bullying and casual spirit sightings that hes long accepted his outcast lot in life. But after his black-sheep uncle (John Goodman) keels over Norman learns that hes next in line for a centuries-old task protecting his 300-year-old town from a destructive witchs curse. The second 3-D stop-motion feature produced by LAIKA Studios which was also behind Henry Selicks Coraline is a visual marvel from the littlest details like Normans uncombable Calvin and Hobbes-esque coif to rip-roaring set pieces such as our heros climactic which-way-is-up confrontation with the tragic enchantress. Yet the arresting sometimes-graphic sturm und drang (theres a black-comic sequence involving a rigor-mortised body thats a bit too cadaverously calculated) rarely overshadows the storys pronounced sense of melancholy. Despite being made of sticks and clay Normans pain is all too human Anyone whos ever walked to school dreading what lies in wait will recognize the Atlas-sized burden that weighs on his shoulders and makes him immediately suspect any seeming act of kindness. Fear continually trumps Normans innate empathy and he has to learn how to bridge the gap--pretty heavy stuff for a movie ostensibly targeted at kids. But sensitive parents shouldnt fret; this is the kind of grim fairy tale equal parts midnight-movie macabre and family-round-the-hearth compassionate that scars in all the right ways.

In scenic Blithe Hollow whose main industry is the window-dressing of its own witch-hunt history and whose founding fathers return one night as marauding zombies a lonely little dead-people seer finds his calling at last. Customarily shunned and necessarily groupthink-resistant young Norman voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee stands poised to transpose middle school estrangement into redemptive proto-adult empathy. This occurs by way of agreeably domesticated grind house tropes tricked out with snazzy F/X. At Comic-Con debut writer and co-director Chris Butler called it ""John Carpenter meets John Hughes"" and that does just about sum ParaNorman up though the actual math still feels a little fuzzy. Butler and co-director Sam Fell of Flushed Away have more vernacular command than tonal harmony; if they achieve roughly equal parts lulz and lulls at least its through a steady pressure of avidity. Better still animation affords a supporting cast playing contentedly against type Anna Kendrick as a vain ditz Christopher Mintz-Plasse as a dopey bully and Casey Affleck as a meathead jock.Film Details ParaNorman RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time93 More Info Trailer Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Jonathan Kiefer Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

The hair counts as a wan joke in this bland diversion since Norman is blithely unafraid of the assorted undead that only he can see in his ghost-infested town. The story may be thin but the project a feat of stop-motion animation is made with generous care by the same impressive LAIKA studio artists who conjured up the gorgeous Coraline.

Few movies so taken with death have felt so rudely alive as ""ParaNorman"" the latest handcrafted marvel from the stop-motion artists at Laika (""Coraline""). Drawing on a deep affection for horror movies and a keen sense of spooky snarky fun British helmers Sam Fell and Chris Butler spin an imaginative patchwork tale of a boy who sees dead people a witchs curse and a small-minded township reeling from a zombie uprising. Probably too morbid for moppets the Focus release wont command rabid B.O. but its singular sensibility should captivate older kids teens and adults spelling a healthy homevid afterlife. From its clever opening scene -- a droll riff on horror-thriller conventions framed in boxy pan-and-scan with a boom mic intruding clumsily on the action -- the picture evinces a sly sophisticated wit and an easy familiarity with the sort of old-school creature-features that once defined the reputation of Focus parent studio Universal. Maintaining a similarly high level of knowing humor the material here could theoretically have yielded a fine film in any style of animation; still its hard to imagine a more intuitive fit than stop-motion a process whose demand for painstaking perfectionism at every stage appears to have extended upward to Butlers wicked-clever screenplay. No less than 2009s ""Coraline"" ""ParaNorman"" is classic adolescent-misfit stuff serving up an immediately empathetic character in Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) a bright but unpopular kid with earnest blue eyes and a tall hedgelike shock of brown hair. Living with his family in the New England town of Blithe Hollow Norman has the very ""Sixth Sense""-like ability to see and commune with the dead carrying on a relationship with his late grandmother (Elaine Stritch) and other invisible ectoplasmic beings who have left behind unfinished business. While its presented to viewers as no big deal Normans gift worries his skeptical parents (Leslie Mann Jeff Garlin) annoys his teenage sister (Anna Kendrick) and gets him in trouble with a school bully (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). It also earns Norman the attention of another local outcast the overgrown Prenderghast (John Goodman) who warns him about an ancient curse that will soon take effect causing the dead to rise again. In a setup that merges zombie-thriller and teen-movie tropes Norman and his reluctant allies -- who include chubby classmate Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) and his jockish older brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) -- must fend off an undead army in a dark forest a pitchfork-waving mob and a witch with a 300-year-old grudge (voiced with memorable shrillness by Jodelle Ferland). As derivative and occasionally belabored as the proceedings are theyre enlivened by a steady stream of smart sight gags and one-liners that occasionally favor viewers with an irreverent wink but never stoop to jabbing them in the ribs; even when ""Tubular Bells"" pops up on the soundtrack the yuks feel entirely of a piece with the universe Fell Butler and their ace team of designers and animators have constructed. Indeed theres a sharp acerbic edge to the humor that turns out to be no mere laughing matter; churning beneath the story is a core of genuine rage at the idiocy of the mob mentality the collective impulse to terrorize or ostracize those who refuse to blend in. ""ParaNorman"" then insists on the importance of weirdness idiosyncrasy and personal distinction and nowhere is this more apparent than in the continually stimulating and mercurial visual style concocted by Fell (who directed ""Flushed Away"" and ""The Tale of Despereaux"") and rookie helmer Butler. The intrinsically unstable look of stop-motion rendering with its putty-like puppets and wobbly frame-at-a-time rhythms has long been suited to the nightmare realms inhabited by directors like Tim Burton and Henry Selick and the effect here is at once eerily enveloping and gloriously unabashedly cartoonish. The ramshackle houses and colonial-style architecture of Blithe Hollow modeled on early-Massachusetts townships like Salem and Concord as well as the photography of William Eggleston convey a striking sense of place accented by the autumnal hues of Tristan Olivers widescreen cinematography. Lensing is as agile and resourceful as that of any live-action production from the mobile camerawork (achieved with rigs that only compound the degree of difficulty of individual shots) to the use of old-fashioned rack focus. The persuasiveness of the storys milieu provides an anchor for its more fantastical images such as a witchs face leering malevolently down from the skies a vision that might have been rendered in artfully crinkled tissue paper. Only the climax a blinding-white vision that sticks out from the rest of the film reps a visual disappointment albeit one compensated for by the sequences sheer emotional force. Although the 3D isnt deployed quite as impressively as it was in ""Coraline"" its done with a similar degree of taste and artful restraint. Voicework is topnotch particularly Smit-McPhees winning underdog turn and Jon Brions playfully creepy score nails the pics tone.

TWITTER From the makers of ""Coraline"" the stop-motion animated comedy follows a young boy with the ability to communicate with the dead. From the makers of Coraline but lacking that 2009 films captivatingly macabre gentle touch ParaNorman is an amusing but only fitfully involving animated caper about an 11-year-old boy with the ability to communicate with the dead -- and undead. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Avengers Dark Knight Prometheus With its technically assured stop-motion animation and promising setup the film co-directed by Sam Fell (Flushed Away) and Chris Butler (storyboard supervisor on Coraline) had the makings of something more substantial but it ultimately comes up short on story and character development. There should still be enough going on to engage both the stop-motion and zombie-flick aficionado but the unmistakable Tim Burton-Henry Selick vibe likely will be too intense for younger viewers. VIDEO Anna Kendrick on Voicing a Character in ParaNorman Set in the sleepy town of Blithe Hollow whose tourist-attraction bragging rights hinge on it being the site of a 300-year-old witch hunt ParaNorman concerns the extrasensory talents of young resident Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) whose habit of conversing with its dead denizens has made him the local freak. Sharing that view is his flustered dad (Jeff Garlin) and shallow big sis (Anna Kendrick) who are creeped out by the fact that Norman likes to watch TV with the ghost of his grandma (Elaine Stritch). More encouraging is his odd homeless uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) who sees in the big-eyed kid a kindred spirit -- and the only one wholl be able to prevent a stubborn witchs curse from breaking loose all sorts of hell starting with the zombified founding fathers. Wry touches abound from the retro titles onward but though the filmmakers have said that they were going for a ""John Carpenter meets John Hughes"" vibe those diverse styles never quite come together. VIDEO ParaNorman Trailer Promises a Spooky Trip But more problematic than establishing a unifying tone and sticking with it is the failure of Butlers script to give his characters (particularly those walking-dead elders) enough to do and inventive ways of doing it. Although the 3D element doesnt really enhance all that much Laika Studios distinctive stop-motion technique makes for notably fluid jerk-free detailed animation that continues to introduce fresh intriguing possibilities to the venerable Ray Harryhausen model.

The exceptions to the ghettoization of stop-motion animation from ""Robot Chicken"" to ""Corpse Bride"" prove the process hasnt lost its appeal among newer technologies. Of course whereas animators may struggle to root digital images in the real world stop motion has a leg up by starting there. Upgraded to 3-D the effect is even more wondrous pulling viewers into a world that seems familiar while departing in a spectacular act of optical magic. Thats the primary distinction that made both Henry Selicks 2009 Oscar nominee ""Coraline"" and now ""ParaNorman"" stand out. Selicks ethereal adaptation of Neil Gaimans book made its eerie themes of dark truths encroaching on childhood innocence more pronounced; original property ""ParaNorman"" struggles to match its technical wizardry with an equally compelling story. If only the talent driving the visuals had enhanced the screenplay as well. Both productions of the Oregon-based Laika animation studio ""Coraline"" and ""ParaNorman"" have much in common They each feature a disturbed alienated child aiding ghostly characters stuck on Earth until the mystery of their deaths is solved. Unlike ""Coraline"" however ""ParaNorman"" dives right into its supernatural ingredients. From the opening scene its clear that wide-eyed middle schooler Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) sees dead people -- loads of them from his doting grandmother who watches television with him to a half dozen affable glowing spectres he greets on the way to school. Divorced from any specific narrative the movies earliest scenes are disarming and charming despite the ghoulish context. Norman doesnt question his power or appear particularly bothered by the ghosts; the grinning corpses that greet Norman along his commute to school are the friendliest of their kind since Casper. While his neurotic father (Jeff Garlin) dismisses his sons chatter as the ramblings of a disturbed child Normans apparent comfort with his visions immediately establish his comfort as an outsider. At this point whether or not his floating visions truly exist only matters if youre equally bothered by the possibility that Hobbes was a product of Calvins imagination. When the plot grows complicated however it quickly becomes evident that directors Sam Fell and Chris Butler intend to explore a lot more than an overactive childs mind. Set in a small New England community haunted by its ancient history of witchcraft trials ""ParaNorman"" eventually finds Norman using his power to literally address the demons of his towns past. After his spooky uncle (John Goodman) tells him he must stop ""the witchs curse"" before disaster strikes Norman races against time to stop a group of newly risen zombies from wreaking havoc in town. These would be the persecutors of a late witch whose spirit has grown restless in the years since her death and its up to Norman to calm her with the help of a few newfound friends. The ensuing romp finds Norman joining forces with a portly classmate (Tucker Albrizzi) his hunky teen brother (Casey Affleck) and Normans churlish older sister in order to stop the resurrected dead in their tracks. Their ensuing attempts unfold with a series of comic chase scenes interspersed with witty dialogue but Butlers script trades nuance for a breezy sense of humor that frequently undercuts the deeper themes at work. At the same time the bleak cause of the disaster -- no less than Americas lingering guilt for the murder of those charged with witchcraft -- endows ""ParaNorman"" with a profound message about the need to come to terms with a past generations sins. More than the troubled the script the visuals reflect the intrusion of deeper truths on an oppressed world as they shift from the mundane grays of suburbia to the effervescent neon palette that overwhelms the screen in the sensational climax. Jon Brions pensive score accentuates the imagery to marvelous effect. Unlike the polished universe of Pixars ""Brave"" or countless other recent CGI efforts ""ParaNorman"" maintains a delicate handcrafted look that underscores its ideas. The movie is truly progressive down to a handful of minor details (in a sly nod to a society that has moved forward the closing scene includes an acknowledgement of sexual preferences that Im pretty sure has never surfaced in a movie of this type). And yet everything that makes it succeed also draws attention to the derivative and often sloppy qualities of the script that hold it back. As a gothic fantasy aimed at viewers the same age as the protagonist ""ParaNorman"" is both a cut above and more of the same. Criticwire grade B- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Focus Features releases ""ParaNorman"" nationwide on August 17. Arriving at the tail end of the summer it should do well among family audiences and has a good chance of remaining in play for awards season given the limited field for animated features. However mixed reviews may result in its inability to replicate the success of ""Coraline"" from years ago.
