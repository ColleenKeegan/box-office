The Morgans are boutique estate agent Meryl (Sarah Jessica Parker) and swanky expat English lawyer Paul (Hugh Grant) and their marriage is in trouble - fertility issues infidelity (his) and so on. However as plot contrivance would have it on their night out to patch things up they see one of her wealthy clients being bumped off and soon to protect them from the killer at large they find themselves spirited away to darkest Wyoming. Together - gulp Without their mobiles - horrorWere supposed to care whether they do actually remain together but there are distractions like wondering whether SJPs somewhat amorphous skin tone means shes actually been replaced by a CGI avatar of herself. Or quite why Grant who hustles awfully hard with material youd hardly call fluff keeps working with writer-director Marc Lawrence - he who brought us Two Weeks Notice and Music amp; Lyrics the celluloid equivalent of microwaveable ready meals. Theres a kind of functional professionalism which keeps things burbling along painlessly enough but its an experience more fitting to a flu-ish afternoon on the sofa or long-haul in economy when were at our least demanding. Rootin tootin cowboy folk Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen add some downhome charm but from the moment we see posters warning of grizzly attacks in the area a rampaging bear cant arrive soon enough.

Theyre going to have to strike ""Hugh Grant Westerns"" from the list of most unlikely ""Jeopardy"" categories. ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" finds His Royal Hughness prancing forth in a saddle instead of loafers covering his moussed Oxford locks with a cowboy hat and even modeling a plaid shirt with snapping metal buttons. Caution Brain cells may combust when images of Grant clash with the soundtrack stylings of the Allman Brothers. Manhattan lawyer Paul (Grant) and his estranged wife luxury real estate broker Meryl (Sarah Jessica Parker) -- he begs her forgiveness for cheating on her but she doesnt love him anymore probably -- are forced both to reunite and move to gravel-road Wyoming in a witness-protection deal after they observe a murder. Lawman ""Wouldnt you rather live someplace else than die in New York?"" Meryl after a Jack Benny pause ""Im thinking"" PHOTOS ""DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS?"" FILMING IN NEW YORK PHOTOS ""DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS?"" PREMIERE With a killer tracking their movements as they attempt to disappear into the community -- ""Green Acres"" meets ""My Blue Heaven"" -- for once Hugh faces the possibility of dying of something other than embarrassment while Sarah Jessica will discover that hoedown means something other than Samantha battling depression. Another inveterate New Yorker -- Sal in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" -- once said that the foreign country he would move to if necessary was Wyoming and Paul and Meryl are equally ill-acquainted with their new homeland. At the local Bargain Barn she finds that sweaters are 9.99 -- and is thrilled. Paul has a question ""Wheres the menswear?"" Tilt too far either to hick jokes or to the calming rhythms of rural life and youve got yourself a 10-gallon cliche. But writer-director Marc Lawrence (who failed to keep Grant from looking defeated by working with Drew Barrymore in the tolerable but inferior ""Music amp; Lyrics"") deals an equal number of zingers in all four directions -- city and country wincing husband and unamused wife. For the average New Yorker the Sarah Palin joke alone is probably worth the price of admission. Small-towners though more than hold their own. Hosting them the marshal (Sam Elliott) and his crack-shot bride (Mary Steenburgen) try to teach riflery to Paul who cant handle the recoil in his delicate shoulder ""God in heaven that hurt. Agony Agony"" Wilford Brimley slips in -- ooh the burn -- to call Paul a ""tea drinker."" When Meryl wonders whether any Democrats are in town its a sly little girl who pipes up ""Fourteen. And we know who they are."" The comedy doesnt expend a lot of effort on plausibility no need. Only the jokes and the relationship matter and Lawrence aiming merely to deliver a sort of Bargain Barn version of Preston Sturges ""The Palm Beach Story"" is deft with both. The cast is in such fine form that everything seems funny even goofy little asides like one from Brimley about how his granddaughter will be the next American Idol. As for Grant who hasnt been this sharp since ""Love Actually"" six years ago he is once again the prime minister of cute comedy. Hes almost brilliant enough to forgive him for the cancerously unfunny ""American Dreamz."" kyle.smith nypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Clooney Streep Bullock among SAG Awards noms Read Next Clooney Streep Bullock among SAG Awards noms Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16058 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

You dont want to hear about the Morgans | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentYou dont want to hear about the MorgansIts a pity theres no witness protection program for movies that commit crimes against audiences. Then Did You Hear About the Morgans? would be living under an assumed title in the delete bin at a rural Blockbuster.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Dec. 18 2009 the Morgans?(out of 4)Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Hugh Grant Mary Steenburgen and Sam Elliott. Directed by Marc Lawrence. Article Continued Below103 minutes. At major theatres. PG Its a pity theres no witness protection program for movies that commit crimes against audiences. Then Did You Hear About the Morgans? would be living under an assumed title in the delete bin at a rural Blockbuster.Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant are recently separated New York power couple Meryl and Paul Morgan who accidentally witness a murder. Theyre hustled off to Middle-of-Nowhere Wyoming to hide from the hitman under the governments witness protection program and the care of plain- spoken Sheriff Clay Wheeler (Sam Elliott) and his wife Emma (Mary Steenburgen). Elliott and Steenburgen are the reason for the lone-star status of this movie. It belongs to them brave souls for shining in every frame where they appear. Steenburgen is especially appealing as a laid-back sharpshooter with a lovely smile and wisdom aplenty.While the sheriff and his Mrs. seem the real deal Parker and Grant are painful to watch. Theres zero chemistry between them which at least makes the separation angle credible. She channels Carrie Bradshaw banished to the sticks without her BlackBerry and Bloomingdales credit card and he does the trademarked Hugh Grant boyish charm thing muttering his lines and looking worried. Meryl carps so much at hubby Paul over his admitted episode of infidelity she almost spouts fins. Paul spends every scene apologizing. It wears thin.See vegetarian Meryl gag at the sight of a pork-laden country breakfast. Chuckle as she makes her first foray into a big-box store. Watch her try to ride a horse. Laugh at silly Paul learning to fire a rifle. See him visit a hayseed rural doctor and his dim-bulb nurse. Look Rodeo clownsAnd then theres the bear a scene that is set up so elaborately from the first reel youre praying for the bruin to show up so you can cross another cute conflict off the list. But no bear with the Morgans. There are more gags to come.Its hard to keep a couple of witnesses hidden - even when they try to blend in by donning cowboy hats - especially when they keep their same first names. Not like Meryl is an uncommon handle. Meanwhile back in New York a ridiculous sub-plot evolves with Meryl and Pauls eager-beaver assistants played by Jesse Liebman and Mad Mens Elisabeth Moss (who should fire her agent).Both onscreen vets Parker and Grant have no problems carrying a picture so writer-director Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality) is the one to blame for this disaster.His last movie the 2007 rom-com Music and Lyrics also starring Grant playing a washed-up 80s pop singer had far more charm than the one-note Morgans.Will facing danger in a rural backwater as they hide from a killer bring Meryl and Paul back together? Does a bear you-know-what in the witness-protection woods?Please Morgans stay hidden.

Two witnesses but little wit Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant play a wealthy couple in witness protection in Wyoming. (Barry Wetcher) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / December 18 2009 E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Regarding ""Did You Hear About the Morgans? a new comedy with Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker Yes I have heard indeed and the news is terrible. Most bad comedies plod from scene to scene. This one plods from sentence to sentence. Grant and Parker stand around as if theyre waiting for someone to yell ""Cut. Hes in one movie. Shes in another. Neither is any good.To be fair theyre playing Paul and Meryl Morgan a moneyed New York couple on the verge of divorce. One evening an argument between them is interrupted when one of her real estate clients falls off a balcony with a knife in his back (making him the envy of paying audiences everywhere). They see the killer (Michael Kelly). The killer sees them. Before long US Marshals have deemed the Morgans star witnesses and hide them away in a protection program that lands them in Wyoming where the comedy is as sparse as the landscape.This is the sort of movie where the city folk never miss a chance to condescend to their rural hosts two married marshals played by Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen neither of whom is given much to say. But their exasperation feels apparent all the same. Who can blame them? Meryl with her disdain for meat and overcaffeinated amazement at big-box stores and Paul with his English accent are obnoxious. These arent personality traits theyre screenwriting devices. The marshals even have moose heads on their wall and no cable. An amusingly Republican Wilfred Brimley is called upon to draw more blue-state blood.As the Morgans start to fall back in love with each other so do their assistants (Elisabeth Moss and Jesse Liebman) back in New York. Meanwhile the killer gets closer to Wyoming. The screenplay makes this embarrassingly easy. He bugs Meryls office and Meryl sneaks traceable phone calls. This is the kind of movie that seemed to come out every month in the late 1970s and 1980s - screwball thrillers in which a woman (or two) run from a murderer. One of those Goldie Hawn-Chevy Chase movies comes to mind - ""Foul Play maybe. By their finales the Hawn-Chase films tended to run aground but they were funny and you could tell the people in them were having a good time.The same cant be said of ""The Morgans which Marc Lawrence wrote and directed. Everyone looks as if theyd rather be somewhere else. Ive seen this in Lawrences other romantic comedies - several with Sandra Bullock which he only wrote; and ""Music and Lyrics and ""Two Weeks both with Grant.Hawn and Chase had complementary approaches to comedy. Her breathlessness brought out something ironic in him She made him seem like a debonair sleaze. Parker puts jokes over by feigning modesty. Its a spotty approach. When Elliott invites her to milk a cow she bats her eyelashes clutches her hands and asks ""Which one is skim? Itd be a nice line were it delivered with any snap.The less said about Grant the better. He and Parker have worked together before in a forgettable 1996 hospital thriller called ""Extreme Measures. The intervening years have sapped from him any remaining interest in her. He has a bigger reaction to the brown bear that chases him (frankly so does Parker). His punch lines are witless too. Once theyve left Grants mouth he looks chagrined as everyone sits around taking in the dead joke. Every time he speaks it feels like a funeral.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 17 2009 219PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Did You Hear About the Morgans? Written and directed by Marc Lawrence Starring Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker Classification PG If youve seen the lively trailer for Did You Hear About the Morgans?  you will already know its a couple comedy starring Hugh Grant cast as - surprise - a bumbling charming and sarcastic Englishman and Sarah Jessica Parker as - surprise again - a winsome and fashionable New Yorker. They co-star as a soon-to-be-divorced couple who are relocated to a small town in Wyoming as part of a federal witness-protection program. While being guarded by a crusty old sheriff and his Annie Oakley-like wife (Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen) these city slickers get close again. They also learn to shoot and ride horses Western skills that will undoubtedly come in handy when the bad guy or guys come after them. If you are expecting a pleasant evening of escapism you will be cruelly fooled. The editor responsible for the trailer is clearly a genius. Every remotely humorous moment from Did You Hear About the Morgans? has been carefully included and in most cases improved in the trailer. Stretched out to its full 106 minutes this is a fish-out-of-water comedy gasping for comic oxygen. Grant plays a lawyer named Paul and Parker his estranged wife Meryl a real-estate agent (allowing for some Sex and the City -style condo-porn tours). Each has a cute personal assistant respectively Jackie (Elisabeth Moss of televisions Mad Men ) and Adam (Jesse Liebman) who spend a lot of their time texting on their BlackBerries. One night Paul and Meryl witness the murder of one of her clients who turns out to be an arms dealer. The assassin Vincent (Michael Kelly) who is working for some undefined foreign interests recognizes Meryl from a magazine cover and makes an attempt on her life. The FBI puts them on a plane and they find themselves in the hamlet of Ray Wyo. where they are taken in by the sheriff and his wife. A series of sluggishly paced scenes deal with predictable jokes about Meryls vegetarianism and the pairs leftish politics and unfamiliarity with box stores milking cows chopping wood and escaping from grizzly bears. There are a few underdeveloped local rubes - a dim-bulb nurse a doctor who treats everyone as a child and an old grouch (Wilfred Brimley) who takes an instant dislike to Paul. Writer-director Marc Lawrence has delivered competent comedies starring Grant before - Two Weeks Notice and Music and Lyrics - so its a puzzle why this feature feels more predictable but less polished. Particularly painful is the poor integration of a subplot about the couples marital difficulties (infertility infidelity) crudely sandwiched between the stereotypes and slapstick. The nights in Wyoming says Paul are so quiet ""you can hear your cells divide."" Thats not a bad description of the feeling during most scenes between Grant and Parker - those long painful moments after the actors deliver their lines where the laughs are meant to be.

Or maybe the one about leathery hicks teaching city slickers a thing or two about life and love?If these variations on a theme dont ring a cowbell then ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" may hold some charm. tagromantic comedy Otherwise this trout-out-of-water in-defense-of-marriage comedy is discouragingly conventional. Stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant typically have nice comedic timing. But for them to work their gifts the script must have some fresh rhythms of its own. Director Marc Lawrence wrote this story about a couple faltering after an infidelity. Paul a lawyer is sorry. Truly. Grant has always been deft at pantomiming bad-puppy remorse. A sought-after Manhattan real estate broker Meryl is not ready to forgive. Parker can do steely sorrow. Each has a personal assistant who appears to be an extension of their personality. His played by Jesse Liebman is a tentative whelp. Hers is an imperious ahem Girl Friday. As Meryls officious assistant Elisabeth Moss (""Mad Men"") stirs curiosity about what shed do with a subtly scripted role. Separated when the film opens the Morgans look to be headed toward the shoals of divorce when they witness a mob hit. The feds arrive. The Morgans depart. Against their mouthy protestations and for their own protection theyre relocated to Wyoming. Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen portray Clay and Emma Wheeler the law in the tiny tiny town of Ray. ""Did you Hear About the Morgans?"" seems to have only now discovered the so-called flyover states. The town is a folksy one-general-store one-restaurant one-doctor burg. Its inhabitants are generous or daft or calloused. Case in point a rough-hewn codger played by Wilford Brimley. In other words its populated by real characters. Steenburgen provides a mix of flinty and feisty. And we could listen to Elliott recite the telephone book -- or extol the virtues of pure Rocky Mountain water and high-country barley -- and be content. But the basso cowboy and his gun-toting missus are mostly comfy props for the sturdiness of good marriages. A lovely too-fleeting meeting of comedy and truth happens when Meryl confesses her disappointment to Paul. Its not a revelation to us and shouldnt be to him. Still something transpires between the camera and Parker that makes the moment quietly authentic. More often nuance remains elusive. The characterization of the couples provincial attitudes -- especially Meryls -- is as clumsy as the films problems with local color. Yes comedies thrive on broad strokes. But selling Americans lame images of one another as if we havent traversed the country (if not in actuality via television and film) is dispiriting. Its fairly shameful to have Parker (known for her savvy turn as a New Yorker in ""Sex and the City"") update Eva Gabors character from ""Green Acres."" Darlin we love you but head back to Park Avenue. ""did you hear about the morgans?""  1/2 PG-13 for some sexual references and momentary violence. 1 hour 43 minutes.

REVIEW By Mick LaSalle Published 400 am Friday December 18 2009 Watch the trailer for the movie ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" Media San Francisco Chronicle Did You Hear About the Morgans? Romantic comedy. Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Hugh Grant Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen. Directed by Marc Lawrence. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) You probably dont know the name Marc Lawrence but both as a writer and writer-director he has made some fine romantic comedies over the last 10 years including ""Miss Congeniality"" ""Forces of Nature"" ""Two Weeks Notice"" and ""Music and Lyrics."" These arent necessarily credits to earn a lifetime-achievement Oscar but all are solid pleasing comedies with wit personality and a few surprises. Alas ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" is not in that category. Sometimes its unpleasant sometimes its insincere and for long stretches its boring. There are good parts too but they all come in the first 10 minutes. Surprisingly Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker who have lots of charm and know something about comedy cant save it. In fact Grants charm deserts him in ""Morgans."" Hes mannered and uncomfortable and seems to be phoning it in with all his might. The movie begins at what would normally be the middle of a romantic comedy Paul (Grant) and Meryl (Parker) are married but theyre separated because he had a one-night stand with another woman. And so hes groveling and apologizing and doing everything he can to get her back. Photo Barry Wetcher Columbia Pictures Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant star in Columbia Pictures comedy DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS? Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant star in Columbia Pictures comedy DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS? Photo Barry Wetcher Columbia Pictures Did You Hear About the (humorless) Morgans? 1 / 1 Back to Gallery That seems like just enough plot to get things going but no. Returning from a dinner date the two witness a murder and next thing you know theyre forced to go to Wyoming in the witness protection program. There was potential for comedy in this Two people who are estranged and cant stand each other are forced by necessity to live under the same roof. But thats not the case here. Hes contrite and shes disappointed. Wheres the comedy in that? He apologizes and shes still disappointed. So he keeps apologizing. This leaves these comic actors no room to maneuver. No wonder Grant is drowning in this. He locks his shoulders makes stiff gestures with his arms and moves his head in whats supposed to be a funny way. Meanwhile we know hes not funny and he probably wishes he could tell us that he knows it too. With no comic potential on the relationship front and with certainly nothing funny at all about two witnesses being stalked by a murderer the writer-director has to find laughs somewhere. Or at least try to. So he plays the culture-clash card. Paul and Meryl are from the city - Democrats who dont eat a lot of meat. And theyre staying with a U.S. marshal played by Sam Elliott who has moose heads all over his house and whose wife (Mary Steenburgen) is big on guns. Unfortunately that whole strain isnt funny either and worse its irrelevant. Once we know theres a killer after them everything else - that is the whole middle hour of the movie - feels like filler. The cast - even Grant at times - makes it reasonably bearable and Parker has some nice authentic moments as a woman slowly finding her way back from disillusionment. But face it were just picking through the rubble here. I like this director and everybody in the movie and I watched most of ""Morgans"" shifting in my seat to stay awake. -- Advisory This film contains adult sex talk and violence.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Alas Hugh Grant it has come to this. Most of his previous films have exploited his flippant charm. But ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" has no snap no frolicsome energy. Its an exhausted movie; he and co-star Sarah Jessica Parker cant work up the charge they gave to their earlier work. (Parker isnt much of a screen star but she was amiably neurotic on the TV run of ""Sex and the City."") You get the sense theyre not even making a serious honorable try. They play Paul and Meryl estranged New Yorkers who witness a murder and are forced into uneasy togetherness when the witness-protection program ships them to cowboy country. Writer/director Marc Lawrence had broad low-comedy hits with the Sandra Bullock movies ""Miss Congeniality"" and ""Two Weeks Notice."" This one is a painful failure lumpish and crude. As they adjust to life way out West the effete Morgans bumble through encounters with gruff ranchers and aggressive bears but the lame-brained jokes never take you anywhere youd want to go. Neither the New York City scenes nor the Wyoming locations demonstrate any feel for the way Americans really live. Lawrences imagination appears to have been fed entirely by television. Grant is dutiful and passive as Paul. His clothes are neatly pressed and he shows up for work like an office manager sleepwalking toward 5 p.m. He delivers his dialogue with a delicate wince that is meant to italicize its attempted ironies. When he learns that their safe house is in Ray Wyoming Grant asks ""Is that near Phil Wyoming?"" With lines like that littering the script you wonder what they cut out. Knock-knock jokes? No wonder hes grimacing. As the rugged individualist sheriff assigned to protect them Sam Elliott smiles his kindly grandpa smiles and lets his handlebar mustache do most of the acting. There are no characters here just mannerisms. The real shame of the movie is its unexceptional look. The landscape around Yellowstone where the film is supposedly set is one of Americas great scenic wonders. The movie was actually filmed in tax-break haven New Mexico and it looks blah. Inexcusable. DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS?  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sexual references and momentary violence.

"Did You Hear about the Morgans? | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; did-you-hear-about-the-morgans ) Did You Hear about the Morgans? (United States 2009) December 17 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Did You Hear about the Morgans? Yes and to be perfectly frank I wish I had been spared the experience. Im gullible. Ill buy just about any premise Hollywood is selling provided it is sold well. Did You Hear about the Morgans? proves these filmmakers couldnt sell ice cream to a kid in the middle of the summer. Not only does the movie fail to convince it doesnt seem concerned about convincing. Its a romantic comedy so were supposed to take it on faith that the male lead and female lead will end up together at the end. Likewise were not expected to notice the contrived contortions the script goes through to arrive at that destination. The film is so obvious about how it goes about things that its almost embarrassing. Unattended phone in the doctors office - think someone will use it whos not supposed to be making calls? Lessons about shooting a gun - think that will come in handy when the bad guy pays a visit? And what about horse shoe expertise shown by one of the characters? Writer/director Marc Lawrence is inexcusably clumsy in presenting the roadmap. This is what critics mean when they say ""the seams show."" The world inhabited by these individuals fails to become real. Its never anything more than ""just a movie"" and not an especially good one at that. Of all the actresses Hugh Grant has been matched with over the years Sarah Jessica Parker represents a nadir. Theres nothing between these actors. Theres no pop or sizzle. The characters say they love one other but those are just words. Theres no sense of affection. No passion even when they fight. Their dialogue rings hollow. These two arent believable and their relationship is a black hole. Who cares? Were supposed to be invested in getting them to connect by the closing credits but this is one stock that never has value to begin with. As Paul Morgan Grant (over)uses his patented ""aw shucks"" charm to compensate for the fact that his character is a cheating ass. Then again once we are introduced to his less-than-blushing bride Meryl (Sarah Jessica Parker) we can understand the appeal of a one-night stand with someone else. Whats more difficult to comprehend is why he would want to salvage his marriage to someone so shrill superficial and self-absorbed. But he does and thats why theyre wandering a New York City street in the rain at night after having endured a tense dinner. They are unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (kind of like anyone who has ventured into a theater showing this movie). They witness a murder and the killer sees their faces. The FBI places them in the ""witness relocation program"" provides them with new (temporary) identities and ships them off to Ray WY to stay with the local sheriff Clay Wheeler (Sam Elliott) and his wife Emma (Mary Steenburgen). While there Paul and Meryl work to rebuild their marriage while doing stupid things that will allow the killer to discover their location. Did You Hear about the Morgans? wants to be a combination romance and fish-out-of-water comedy but it doesnt succeed as either. It wastes too many opportunities to have some fun with the concept of a materialistic city girl out of her element (consider how little is done with the staple cow-milking scene). Even Green Acres wasnt this inept. Most of the jokes are halfhearted and poorly delivered (although to be fair Grant gets in a few good one-liners). The entire production is weighed down by the preposterous premise and the need to have a final confrontation with the killer. This is an albatross around the neck of a movie that already has too many other things pulling it to the ground. By all accounts Hugh Grant is in a state of semi-retirement. His ability to cherry-pick his projects to suit his tastes makes one wonder why he would select something with such a dubious script. I suppose it has something to do with director Marc Lawrence. This is the third movie they have made together (following the breezy Music and Lyrics and the limp Two Weeks Notice) and they appear to enjoy working together. Too bad the fruit of those efforts isnt less rancid by the time it reaches theaters. Did You Hear about the Morgans?

"Movie review Grant Parker in lackluster Have You Heard About the Morgans? washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments Did You Hear About the Morgans? Movie review Grant Parker in lackluster Have You Heard About the Morgans? Sarah Jessica Parker is dour in this film. (Barry Wetcher) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 18 2009 Any connoisseur of contemporary romantic comedy knows better than to expect too much deviation from the formula. If a couple is on the outs some wacky adversity will inevitably arise drawing them together until they gradually realize that yadda yadda yadda. The fun is not in the subverting of expectations but in their fulfillment. This StoryDid You Hear About the Morgans? A rom-com with little comWatch the trailer One thing is a given that the actors will take at least some small pleasure in the snappy sparring that leads (spoiler alert) to their characters eventual reconciliation. So why do Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker as remorseful adulterer Paul Morgan and his soon-to-be ex-wife Meryl look so gosh-darn miserable in ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" an exercise in foregone conclusions so dreary as to hardly qualify as comedy? For much of the film -- in which the titular estranged couple is forced into hiding in remotest Wyoming after witnessing a murder in Manhattan -- the look on Parkers face is one of such Dostoevskian unhappiness even for a woman who has been cheated on that frankly shes a little hard to watch. And Grant -- who in his two previous outings with writer-director Marc Lawrence (""Two Weeks Notice"" and ""Music and Lyrics"") could at least be relied on to look roguish and tousled -- comes across as perpetually worried and puffy-eyed here as if he just pulled an all-nighter in an emergency room. Whether theyre dealing with a tame-looking grizzly bear or the strangely incompetent hit man (Michael Kelly) whos trying to rub them out the Morgans whine. And if theyre not having fun how the heck are we supposed to? It doesnt help that the film is riddled with fish-out-of-water cliches. The Morgans are wealthy liberal smarty-pantses. Their Hicksville hosts -- played by Mary Steenburgen and for Gods sake Sam Elliott sporting a mustache that almost deserves separate billing -- are working-class conservative rubes. Did you hear about the Morgans? Trust me you dont want to.  PG-13. At area theaters.

(Barry Wetcher SMPSP) Joe Neumaier Thursday December 17 2009 524 PM Title Did You Hear About the Morgans? You know the line about what a bear does in the woods? Not only is that wittier than all of ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" it describes the movie as well.In theory plunking two actors associated with urban sophistication -- Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker -- in the middle of red-state America should be fun. But the loping pace inconsistent tone and lack of imagination are all deadly. Plus you can see the (mostly unfunny) jokes ambling at you from a mile away including every wild animal cow and Wilford Brimley appearance.Grant is Paul Morgan a high-powered New York lawyer whose wife Meryl (Parker) a hot-shot real estate broker kicked him out after he strayed. While returning from a dinner date that the contrite Paul hopes will reunite them a client of Meryls is murdered before their eyes. The police in the least exciting exposition scene ever inform them the hit man they saw will get them next so the duo enter the witness protection program. Their destination a super-rural town in Wyoming.Even though she just scrambled out a high-rise window after being shot at Meryl balks at leaving Manhattan. What about the opera she wails and Nobu and sitting with the paper in Central Park? In Wyoming they have none of that only jes-folks sweetness Republicans and a lot of meat products. Paul and Meryls shock at the dietary and political habits of Middle America suggests they never actually read their paper in Central Park.As this pedestrian comedy of remarriage goes on every fish-out-water cliche is trotted out and no surprise is less amusing than the last. Its too quiet for these out-of-towners Theres a country doc with a dim busty receptionist And hey a rodeo As the gun-lovin gruff-but-sweet married marshals assigned to protect the Morgans Sam Elliott -- now officially Yosemite Sams more-surly brother -- and Mary Steenburgen milk what they have but nothing can help the barren script by Marc Lawrence (""Two Weeks Notice"" ""Music and Lyrics""). And poor Elisabeth Moss (""Mad Men"") is completely wasted as Meryls personal assistant.In a situation like this its up to the stars to kick-start things and while Grant still has a way with a witticism neither he nor Parker appears to have their heart in it. Grants habit of telegraphing snark with his eyes doesnt click with Parkers ""Sex and the City""-honed ability to look wounded and calculating simultaneously.Stuck with sparkle-free material these two usually engaging pros wind up creating an airless uncomfortable void which is something far worse than Wyoming.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Really you dont want to. Here is a movie with everything going for it and nothing working. After the preview I felt an urgent need to enroll in a witless-protection program.This mirth-free comedy costars Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker as unhappily married Manhattanites who after seeing a contract killing are shipped off by the Feds to witness protection in Wyoming. They are remanded to the care of a folksy sheriff (Sam Elliot) and his rifle-totin wife (Mary Steenburgen). Cue Sarah Palin crack.Its an occasion for writer/director Marc Lawrence to indulge in feeble red-state/blue-state jokes that are way past their expiration date and the audiences funny threshold.Did You Hear About the Morgans? is the third film from Lawrence who made the giddily entertaining Two Weeks Notice and Music amp; Lyrics films that boosted Hugh Grants career. He likewise wrote the improbably funny Forces of Nature and Miss Congeniality which did the same for Sandra Bullock. For Lawrence as director the third times the charmless. Morgans the pity.Rarely in the field of human comedy has so little been achieved by such big talents.Grant who typically takes dead-on-arrival dialogue and tickles it to life with nimble verbal gymnastics falls headfirst off the uneven bars. Heck hes even upstaged by Bart the Bear. As for Parker that most effervescent of actresses has temporarily lost her bubbly delivery. The actors are fish out of water flailing away.So is Lawrence who characterizes small-town Wyoming as a place without retail or skyline. Heck arent the Rockies the first American skyscrapers?This movie makes the case that you cant take the boy out of New York without his losing his sense of humor.Showing at Area theaters.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickeyat 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet No one knows his way around romantic comedies better than Hugh Grant who tends to drift through their formulaic paces with light charm glancing wit and affable self-deprecation. But when the material gets really bad as it does in the dismal Did You Hear About The Morgans? his pinched facial expressions become an inadvertent commentary on the movie hes making as if he plainly realizes that his one-liners are tanking. There are countless moments throughout the film when writer-director Marc Lawrence pauses for a laugh line but the jokes hang there for an eternity while Grant winces apologetically like hes just shattered a dish. And Lawrences script--an unwieldy cross between remarriage comedy broad fish-out-of-water farce and mild thriller--keeps deepening his embarrassment as the film plods along. Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker star as married New Yorkers who have been separated for a few months in the wake of his infidelity. One night after meeting for dinner they witness a murder and the murderer witnesses them witnessing a murder which eventually leads them into the witness-protection program until the culprit is apprehended. The authorities send these city slickers to a faraway outpost in rural Wyoming where they stay with ranchers Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen who enjoy a more harmonious marriage out on the prairie. Grant and Parkers confinement leaves them plenty of time to bicker their way back into each others arms while amusing the locals with their wood-chopping and gun-slinging deficiencies. Give Morgans this No one steps in any cowpats. Other than that Lawrence leaves no cliche untouched painting Grant and Parker as wimpy wine-sipping liberals and vegetarians crashing in a house filled with shotguns a vast library of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne DVDs and more taxidermy per square inch than Norman Bates office in Psycho. From the inexplicable title on down theres no palpable investment in these characters or their situation; whenever Lawrence cuts away from the limp banter to go-nowhere subplots such as Grant prepping a will for local crank Wilford Brimley or the burgeoning romance between the couples personal assistants back home his boredom is palpable.

Iron Cross The Young Victoria Wednesday December 16 2009 at 6 p.m. By LA Weekly 2 Jeff Bridges and his Crazy Heart A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - GO  CRAZY HEART Yesterdays honky-tonk hero Bad Blake arrives at a Clovis New Mexico bowling alley. Its another in a string of low-paying low-turnout gigs with pickup bands half his age grinding the Greatest Hits out of an old Fender Tremolux including his breakout -- with the chorus ""Funny how falling feels like flying ... for a little while."" Bads not flying these days; hes dying slowly on a bourbon diet holed up in motels watching Spanish-language smut. Actor-turned-writer-director Scott Cooper adapted Crazy Heart from Thomas Cobbs 1987 novel (the title is a Hank Williams B-Side). Cobb wanted Waylon Jennings for Bad Blake; Jeff Bridges got the part though the now-deceased Jennings and Bads other inspirations hang over it. Its easy to forget as Billboards Country charts fill with faintly twangy pop and lazy paeans to dogs and trucks that this music has an atavistic darkness. Bad has just about bottomed out when a small-time journalist Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) meets him for a rare interview -- and sticks around. Crazy Heart follows the slow recovery of atrophied emotional responses which starts when Bad gets involved with Jean and her young son. The subject rehabilitation is old and resonant. (Says Waylon ""Weve been the same way for years/We need to change."") No scene feels obligatory and Crazy Heart shows a pragmatic but tender understanding of the relationship between physical breakdown and the discovery of morality. Its merely a well-done adult American movie -- that is to say a rarity. (ArcLight Hollywood; AMC Century City)GO  DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS? Lets be honest here Did You Hear About the Morgans? is multiplex meringue compared to the meat-and-potatoes cinema at this most award-whoring time of year. Which is fine. Better than fine frankly as Hugh Grant yet again proves hes the most reliable deadpan smart-ass this or that side of the Atlantic -- and the actor Paul Rudd should aspire to be once he grows out of his bromantic period. Grants Paul Morgan is a Manhattan attorney who along with his estranged wife (Sarah Jessica Parker as New Yorks real estate goddess) witnesses a murder is forced by U.S. Marshals into a relocation program and learns how to love again. Their destination Ray Wyoming where they share a log cabin with the sheriff (Sam Elliott and his mustache) and his deputy missus (Mary Steenburgen). At which point the comedy turns blue -- as in blue state versus red state ""real America"" versus the one populated by liberal vegetarian New Yorkers and Brits who are probably real Jewish too. While the story never strays from its formula (how will these battling Bickersons find love again after all that betrayal and ... oh look a bears chasing Grant) its a thoroughly delightful throwaway -- the kind of movie for which cable TV was made. Marc Lawrence writes and directs -- as he did for Grants Music and Lyrics -- and he sure knows his way round a snappy tune. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)DONT FADE AWAY was not screened in advance of our publication deadline but a review will appear here next week and can be found online at laweekly.com/movies. (Music Hall)FALL DOWN DEAD A straightforward old-fashioned exploitation movie replete with the usual gratuitous sex scene featuring no-name actors gory set pieces and some clever stunt casting Fall Down Dead is reasonably entertaining if unexceptional. Dominique Swain is the damsel in distress Udo Kier the art-crazy serial killer and the late David Carradine a comic-relief security guard; if this movie receives any notoriety at all it will likely be for the fact that Carradines character meets his demise in a manner thats uncomfortably similar to real life. Shooting in Winston-Salem North Carolina (which apparently has a Figueroa Street -- who knew?) director John Keeyes (an Oscar nominee for the short Angelas Body and a maker of direct-to-DVD thrillers ever since) swiftly traps us in a downtown building during rolling blackouts as a madman with a straight razor and love of Picasso corners a group of unlikely stragglers none of whom -- not even the plainclothes cops -- seems to know how to use a gun properly. An unsatisfactory ending setting up for a sequel that will never happen is the most significant sour note; otherwise theres little here worth paying full price for or getting too upset about -- unless youve read the press kit that tries to compare this schlock to Hitchcock.

Sep. 13 600pm GO  HOME The opening scenes of Home -- a nighttime game of street hockey a bathing session that turns into a five-way splash fight -- establish the anarchic sense of play that defines the interactions of the films central family while the casual nudity on display hints at the vaguely incestuous tensions in this uniquely insular clan. The rest of Ursula Meiers confident appealingly bizarre debut feature subjects these tensions to the hothouse environment of a self-willed isolation. When the five members of the family find their remote domestic paradise invaded by the reopening of the abandoned highway adjacent to their house they resort to increasingly lunatic measures to block out the noise -- its but a small step from earplugs to bricking up their house entirely. Eventually paranoia and open hostility set in as a family defined from the start by too great a sense of closeness is forced into even closer proximity. Working with all-star DP Agnes Godard Meier effectively communicates the sense of upended privacy moving easily from the nighttime intrusion of brightly clad construction workers (the eye-straining oranges and yellows of their uniforms registering as a truly alien presence) to the incongruous sight of Isabelle Huppert tending her garden as blurry streaks of traffic zip by.

(Music Hall) GO  MY SON MY SON WHAT HAVE YE DONE Although based on the true story of an unstable actor who cast as Orestes in Sophocles Electra so identified with the role that he actually killed his mother Werner Herzogs wacky My Son My Son What Have Ye Done plays as one long shaggy jape. Local police are coping with a situation in suburban San Diego A matricidal maniac Brad McCullum (played with total conviction by a glowering Michael Shannon) is holed up in the family ranch house with a couple of hostages. Brads clueless fiancee Ingrid (Chloe Sevigny) sits around sipping coffee and regaling an absurdly solicitous detective (Willem Dafoe) with tales of Brads lunacy. Flashbacks show him ragging on his late mother (pop-eyed Grace Zabriskie a favorite creature of executive producer David Lynch) and making a scene at the local naval hospital where the staff objects to his plan to comfort the afflicted with embroidered gift-shop pillows. From time to time Ingrid is spelled as a raconteur by Brads erstwhile director (Herzogs countryman Udo Kier amusingly epicene in his mimed concern). Non sequiturs proliferate -- particularly on the family ostrich farm run by Brads uncle (Brad Dourif). Everything about this berserk essentially static procedural is just crazy enough to be true. In any case Herzog has gone beyond Good and Evil to reinvent himself as a candidate for the wiggiest director of comedy in America today. (Downtown Independent) (J. Hoberman)OCEAN OF PEARLS Just saying ""No"" to the injustices of the American health system leads directly to spiritual enlightenment in this heartfelt but simplistic drama from first-time director Sarab S. Neelam a practicing physician who is also a Sikh. Neelams stand-in in Ocean of Pearls is Amrit Singh (Omid Abtahi) a brilliant doctor with lofty ethical standards buff biceps and a turban that generates dirty looks from goons at airports and outdoor cafes. When Singh is lured from the civilized surroundings of Toronto to the big bad U.S. of A. the hunky sensitive surgeon immediately finds himself butting heads with incompetent doctors and greedy insurance companies. Worst of all are the corrupt hospital administrators who strongly suggest that ditching the turban and cutting his religiously dictated shoulder-length hair is the best way to win friends and influence people in a post-9/11 world. Ocean of Pearls well-meaning but thoroughly predictable scenario asks a series of heavy-handed questions with easy answers. Will Dr. Singh shear his luxurious locks or hold his head high to the tune of a David Crosby anthem? Will Singh stick with the sexy American administrator with whom hes been flirting or return to the nice Sikh girl back home? Will he succumb to the moral bankruptcy of a sick soulless system or rediscover his roots reconcile with his strong but silent Sikh dad and find true inner peace and happiness? Rest assured that all is resolved with a minimum of muss fuss and imagination. (Sunset 5) (Lance Goldenberg)PUNCTURED HOPE ""Trokosi"" translates as ""brides of God"" but in cruel practice it means the ritual enslavement of young virgins in West Africa. Filmed on location in Ghana Punctured Hope aims to both dramatize and denounce this horror which thrives to this day. Director Bruno Pischiutta -- known in Italy for his politically engaged provocative theater work -- uses nonprofessional actors to reenact the true story of Belinda Siamey who plays herself. At age 13 (she is now 23) Siamey -- a top student planning on a university education -- was forcibly surrendered by her family as a virgin sacrifice extorted by local priests to settle an uncles debt an ordeal (genital mutilation; relentless rape) carefully related here in words not pictures. The acting sad to say is stagey and amateurish to the point of often painful distraction (despite our ready sympathy for what Siamey suffered) while the didactic dialogue -- styled to make sure were never lost as to what this or that custom means -- is further hampered by the actors having to speak it in English instead of their native Ewe. Despite such near-fatal drawbacks Punctured Hope fulfills the stated ambitions of Pischiutta and producer Daria Trifu to teach and inspire discussion. The black-magic ceremonies we witness arent slick Hollywood numbers but the stuff as it is lived. The same is true of Siameys performance. Initially when playing herself as ""innocent"" she overacts but as she undergoes catastrophe and (in a moving directorial choice) addresses us directly what she lived through pierces the heart. (Monica 4-Plex) (F.X. Feeney) GO  UNDER THE EIGHTBALL Angry passion and visual high energy define this extraordinary muckraking documentary. The anger and rage that ignite it stem from the puzzling illness that overtakes Lori Hall-Steele sister of Timothy Grey who co-directed the film with Breanne Russell. At first the diagnosis would seem to be chronic fatigue but the symptoms (muscle failure paralysis) begin to wildly contradict each other alternately suggesting lupus Lou Gherig and Lyme disease. Hall-Steeles doctors mask their cluelessness in smug tones; one even tells her ""Everybody dies."" More infuriating are the indifference and outright hostility of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality when Grey discovers a freakish outbreak of identical illness in the area one that aligns with the high degree of toxins in the local well water. This would be powerful galling stuff in itself but instead of limiting Under the Eightball to one womans plight Grey and Russell instead confront the history of Lyme disease and its origins in the U.S. governments decades of medical experiments (using captured Nazi and Japanese scientists) to develop biological warfare. These experiments were practiced on all of us Grey and Russell assert and they make a persuasive case. What might have been dull charts and talking heads are instead clever reenactments and quick cuts with key words and footnotes superimposed in well-chosen graphics. A wealth of information is thereby processed in kinetic leaps yet we are never lost. Grey and his sister were born and raised in Flint Michigan which makes it tempting to reference Flints other native documentarian Michael Moore with whom they share a crusading ferocity. Such glib comparisons burn away fast however The heartbreak that informs the universal reach of Under the Eightball is uniquely personal. (Sunset 5)THE YOUNG VICTORIA Man British heritage cinema can be dull and boring when assembly-lined for the export market. Laboring under lamp-shade millinery hair that looks like cake and more sumptuous banqueting than we should ever have to sit through Emily Blunt is cute sassy and wildly improbable as the titular majesty-in-waiting who in life was a short dumpy policy wonk and energetic social reformer. Biding her time to get out from under her vixen mother (Miranda Richardson as always) and manipulative adviser Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany a perpetually raised eyebrow) who wages war with other pols over her head the willful young minx makes eyes across the water at hubby-to-be Albert (Rupert Friend a total stiff well-cast for once as the earnest Teuton who would sire nine children with Victoria). Sagging beneath reams of expository dialogue by Julian Fellowes who also wrote the far naughtier Gosford Park The Young Victoria reproduces the premise of The Queen (she outsmarts her worldlier advisers) with none of that movies cheek or verve. Plodding from one brocaded talkathon to the next director Jean-Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y.) makes an unannounced left turn into action with a slow-mo assassination attempt that looks like a commercial for something then proceeds as planned to the inevitable nuptial hour.

John Anderson 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr December 15 2009 | 0804AM PT Barely civil Manhattan marrieds witness a murder move to Wyoming and naturally rediscover love. A fish-out-of-water story with a bit of a freshness issue ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant as barely civil Manhattan marrieds who witness a murder move to Wyoming and naturally rediscover love liberty and the pursuit of sappiness. While no one involved needs to go into witness protection ""Morgans"" exploits enough tired presumptions about city-vs.-country life that auds might start to hear the ""Green Acres"" theme playing in their heads. Still the pics star power and writer-director Marc Lawrences flair for the romantic-comedy-as-Jell-O-shot (""Music and Lyrics"") should spell decent B.O. and even a few laughs. Over a black-and-white opening credits sequence we hear lawyer Paul Morgan (Grant) leaving an extended voicemail for his estranged wife Meryl (Parker) a high-rolling New York real estate agent whose success has landed her on the cover of a major magazine. Paul is clearly trying to woo Meryl back but his efforts annoy not only Meryl but also the couples his-and-her personal assistants Jackie (Elisabeth Moss) and Adam (Jesse Liebman) whose obsessive text-messaging and general careerism is neither charming nor funny. Nor for that matter is much of the pics depiction of Manhattan as a soul-crushing hellhole. Everyone looks a bit frantic and miserable. After some begging on Pauls part Meryl agrees to dine with him at a high-end East Side restaurant (presumably so they can bum out all the other people eating 100 dinners). Taking a postprandial walk to their respective homes they get an unexpected treat A murder takes place on a terrace above them the body plummets to the street and the killer shows his face to the startled couple. That the dead man was Meryls client is almost completely irrelevant and so is the ensuing narrative Turns out the victim was an arms dealer and the assassin Vincent (Michael Kelly) presumably was working for a foreign agent or government. Given that the feds know all about the arms dealer and nothing about the killer why wouldnt Vincent just leave town his anonymity intact? Because then there wouldnt be a movie. Instead Vincent begins hunting the Morgans risking everything for nothing and prompting the feds to move the warring couple to Wyoming. Fittingly once Paul and Meryl get out West ""Did Your Hear About the Morgans?"" gets a second wind. The Morgans are received by the local marshal Clay Wheeler (Sam Elliott looking more and more as if his face should be embossed on a U.S. coin) and his wife Emma (Mary Steenburgen) who are used to playing host to federal witnesses/weirdos. Which is a good thing as the Morgans play out their little psychodrama with no regard for the thinness of the walls or the way sound can travel on a night so quiet that as Paul says ""I think I could hear my cells dividing."" The couples get to know each other. ""Do you hunt?"" Emma asks Meryl. ""Just for bargains"" Meryl chirps and as recycled as her line might sound (Parkers delivery could occasionally use a B12 shot) theres a certain liveliness to the way the relationships are portrayed. Clay and Emma arent rednecks and Meryl and Paul arent blinkered idiots who think the world revolves around them; unlike say Renee Zellwegers character in the woeful ""New in Town"" they dont act bent out of shape because theyre stuck in a rustic burg alienating the locals. Theyre self-effacing and fresh even if some of the dialogue isnt. ""Morgans"" moves along predictably enough -- when Paul buys grizzly-bear repellent the question isnt whether he will accidentally spray himself in the face but how many times. As the transplants are introduced to the inevitable charms of Western living and Western politics Lawrences script doesnt shy away from red-state/blue-state realities. But the charm of the film is that it resists turning people into cliches and lets Parker and Grant work their particular magic -- before they get to Wyoming their performances are as stressed out as their characters and while its a dubious conceit that going cowboy is a cure-all they put the notion across as convincingly as possible. Steenburgen makes a sexy lanky cowgirl and Elliott is his usual laconic/iconic self. Another institution Wilford Brimley delivers a something a bit bigger than a cameo as a crusty conservative and New Yorkers nightmare; between him and Elliott its like the National Mustache Faceoff. Production values are top-notch.
