Starring Ben Stiller Jenna Elfman and Edward Norton. Directed by Edward Norton. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Keeping the Faith"" which opens today is about a priest and a rabbi who are both in love with the same woman. It marks the directorial debut of Edward Norton a talented young actor who has been in a half-dozen films and has been nominated for an Oscar twice. Nortons first movie is a middling proposition but with good things to be said for it. First of all Norton does not hog the screen unlike say Barbra Streisand who when she directs herself cant keep the camera off her own face. If anything Norton is too self-effacing cheating himself while lavishing screen time on his co-stars. Secondly the movie has charm that indescribable asset. It comes from Norton himself who plays the priest with a gentleness that is in no way mannered. But there is also Jenna Elfman who plays Anna with complete understanding of the facade and the vulnerabilities of the hard-driving career woman and Ben Stiller a screen klutz who is also capable of kissing the girl and making the audience buy it. Who will she wind up with the priest or the rabbi? That question sounds like the setup for a joke. Its also a genuine source of suspense in ""Keeping the Faith."" But there are problems. A minor but unmistakable one is that Norton has a hard time directing physical shtick. He tries. There are pratfalls. A man offers to carry a womans suitcase and -- oh no -- its heavy. All the physical bits are dead on arrival greeted by the audience with neither a laugh nor an encouraging smirk. More seriously the screenplay -- the feature writing debut of Stuart Blumberg a friend of Nortons from Yale -- has several instances of clumsy storytelling. In one scene in a playground the priest and the rabbi just stand there and hand us a series of expository details. ""Keeping the Faith"" is too long. At two hours it loses energy and becomes repetitious and unnecessarily cumbersome particularly in its last hour. It didnt have to be that way. This is a simple story that would have benefited from some tightening of the plot line. Norton plays Father Finn and Stiller is Rabbi Schram best friends and unconventional clerics with congregations on Manhattans Upper West Side. One day a childhood friend arrives in New York. She gets off the plane looking gorgeous and accessible a winning combination. But shes not Jewish which means she is off-limits for the rabbi. And forget about Father Finn. To its credit ""Keeping the Faith"" doesnt take the easy course of mocking Judaism Catholicism or the religious life. The closest the movie comes to courting controversy is by suggesting that its possible for a priest and a rabbi to fall in love. As the film wears on Rabbi Schram begins to become an unsavory character though the filmmakers dont seem to realize it. That and a weak resolution are the films biggest flaws. While not fatal the damage takes its toll The audi ence is made to wait a long time for an ending thats not worth waiting for. ..

A valentine to New Yorks racial religious and cultural diversity ""Keeping the Faith"" actor Edward Nortons well-shot feature directorial debut is a schematically constructed romantic comedy about an unusual triangle a rabbi and a priest who fall in love with the same woman. Pic benefits from a contempo texture and from pleasant performances by its central trio. Of the current cycle of romantic comedies (and practically every studio is releasing one this season) ""Keeping the Faith"" is arguably the most accomplished -- strong word of mouth could turn it into a popular date movie for movie-goers in their 20s and 30s. Verbose comedy is inspired by numerous love triangles from ""The Philadelphia Story"" to ""Broadcast News"" and by quintessential Big Apple movies by Woody Allen and Paul Mazursky though it lacks those films wit depth and star charisma. Ideological and commercial considerations march hand in hand in the touchy-feely script by Stuart Blumberg Nortons Yale pal and an investment banker before turning to filmmaking. Tensions between tradition and modernity love and friendship career and marriage are all too smoothly and easily resolved before the end credits. The first act which is too cutesy for its own good unfolds in the mode of Woody Allens 70s comedies. Narrated by Brian it reconstructs the boisterously happy childhood of the protagonists as seventh-graders until Anna moves out of the neighborhood which breaks the hearts of Brian and Jake. Story proper begins when the mature Anna (Jenna Elfman) unexpectedly calls Brian (Norton) to announce her arrival in New York and he and Jake (Ben Stiller) rush to the airport to greet her. Brian has become a priest Jake a rabbi and Anna a driven exec addicted to her cell phone. Script conveys the sense of ambitious overconfident youngsters all idealistically committed to their calling who suddenly realize that something major is missing from their lives. Initial hour chronicles how the trio conduct their work-dominated lives. A highly motivated perfectionist Jake experiments with ""unkosher"" ways of rejuvenating the old religious practices by bringing a black gospel choir to his congregation and encouraging group meditation. He is a most eligible Upper West Side bachelor who goes on a series of dates arranged by members of his temple who are anxious that he marry a Jewish girl. One of pics highlights is a date with a fit athlete Ali (Lisa Edelstein) in a scene that draws on slapstick comedy. Several blocks away from Jakes temple is the Catholic church where Brian introduces his own innovations. A conscientious priest he plays an active role in his community demonstrating a good command of Spanish and empathy for its needy residents. Brian and Jakes solid friendship is threatened when Jake and Anna realize they are attracted to each other and engage in a wild affair without bothering to tell their best friend. When Anna falls harder for Jake than either of them anticipated they find their well-ordered priorities thrown into disarray. The audience is always one step ahead of the characters in this predictable yarn. But to pics credit the central trio are portrayed as down-to-earth individuals. Further helping the none-too-snappy proceedings are the colorful milieu and especially the gallery of character actors. Anne Bancroft brings authority to the role of Jakes overly concerned (though not stereotypically domineering) mother whos alienated from her older son because she could never accept his gentile wife. Eli Wallach is cast as Rabbi Lewis who functions as a peacemaker between the temples more traditional members and Jakes unconventional methods. Holland Taylor commands as an elegant temple member anxious for Jake to date her rising TV anchor daughter (Rena Sofer) and in a custom-tailored part helmer Milos Forman shows up as Father Havel Brians compassionate boss who confides that despite rules and restrictions he too has fallen in love with several women in his life. In its effort to convey a multicultural New York pic panders to viewers with such secondary characters as an Indian bartender of mixed blood (Brian George) who offers a sympathetic ear to Brians cri de coeur and an eccentric Asian salesman (Ken Leung) who at the yarns flippant ending performs karoake with Jake and Brian. Of the central trio the most commendable performance comes from Stiller who carries the film. Elfman of TVs ""Dharma amp; Greg"" is likable but lacks the wits and charisma that Carole Lombard Irene Dunne or Katharine Hepburn would have brought to such a role. In the most demanding but often thankless and bland role the gifted Norton acquits himself honorably. Norton directs with assurance and strong technical support from lenser Anastas Michos production designer Wynn P. Thomas costumer Michael Kaplan and composer Elmer Bernstein gives the film a polished veneer making it a far more enjoyable experience than one would expect given its diagrammatic overlong script.

Oscar loved Felix Bridget loved Bernie Dharma loves Greg because...2000-04-21Ron RifkinSpyglass Entertainment C Keeping the Faith Genre Comedy; Starring Edward Norton Ben Stiller Ron Rifkin; Director Edward Norton; Producer (person) Edward Norton; Runtime (in minutes) 128; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Spyglass Entertainment Posted April 21 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT Comedy relies on differences which is why sitcom couples are rarely two of a kind. Oscar loved Felix Bridget loved Bernie Dharma loves Greg because the superficial problems of opposites are the strike zone of punchlines. But for opposites to confront serious issues -- really fundamental problems that cant be jested away -- laughs are rarely enough. Keeping the Faith begins as a comedy about Brian (Edward Norton) and Jake (Ben Stiller) who were best friends as boys and who are now best friends as a charismatic priest (Norton appealing in a clerical collar) and a groovy rabbi (Stiller master of killer stand-up sermons) ministering to two of the more satisfied congregations of New Yorks Upper West Side. When Anna (Jenna Elfman) a third childhood musketeer who moved away long ago returns to Manhattan as a sleek businesswoman shes still so captivating (in her blond Christian way) that she enchants her old boy friends all over again. Only this time the gregarious gentile is loved by a rabbi (whose congregants expect him to marry within his faith) and a priest (whose parishioners expect him not to marry period). Oy. Sweet Jesus. Cut to commercial. Only there is no commercial -- just a scrambled approximation of the Beatles psalm ""All you need is love."" So while trying to be a deeper fable of religion and tolerance Keeping the Faith commits sins of romantic comedy as well as sins of spiritual tragedy. Norton makes his directorial debut working from a script by his old Yale classmate Stuart Blumberg and the two have a nice easy handle on some of the daily rituals known to modern clergymen who live within delivery distance of the celebrated Manhattan delicatessen Zabars. Norton particularly projects an unforced goodness as a man of the cloth whos also comfortable being a man of the neighborhood. He confesses the challenge Anna presents to his chastity in talks with a wise priestly mentor (Milos Forman) while Jake endures some typical no-chemistry kosher dates with a gym rat (Lisa Edelstein) and an overglamorous TV journalist (Rena Sofer). Although Elfman scampers like shes wearing bells on her toes we only have the filmmakers word that Anna is truly an irresistible life force -- from all evidence shes so blithe that she doesnt understand why its a big deal for Jake to go interfaith. ""The fact that youre not Jewish is a real problem for me"" says Jake to Anna like its something hes required to ""get past."" (Or for that matter that shes required to accommodate.) And of course in sitcoms it is. But Keeping the Faith proposes heavy theological aims then disavows any such thing. The unsettling conclusion to be drawn is that the truly devout (i.e. loving) man is the one willing to overturn deeply held principles and responsibilities for the sake of romance and that friends family and flock are always willing to say amen in the name of happy endings and ecumenical laughs.
