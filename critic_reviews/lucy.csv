Riffing on her recent performance in Under the Skin Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy an American student in the Taiwanese capital Taipei who is forced to act as a drug mule for a group of brutal Korean gangsters. But when the powder shes carrying leaks into her bloodstream Lucy finds herself acquiring strange superheroic powers. Is she going mad or becoming God? Lucy is not about to win any prizes from Mensa. Besson hauls in a bemused-looking Morgan Freeman as a neuroscientist in a vain effort to give legitimacy to the films pseudo-scientific plotline (wheeling out the old we only use 10 percent of our brains myth). But crammed as it is with snarling foreign villains feisty punch-ups and a peculiar habit of intercutting frames of random wildlife footage into the main action this isnt quite like any other blockbuster youll see this year - for better or worse.

No one has ever accused French action director Luc Besson of thinking too hard and this frantic exercise in pseudoscience and goofball metaphysics is best enjoyed by following his lead. The title refers not only to the main character but also to the famous fossilized skeleton an ancestor of Homo sapiens; Besson implies that both represent the birth of a new species turning this enjoyable shoot-em-up into a dumbbell 2001 A Space Odyssey.

"Review Lucy is an action-packed waste of brain power - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Lucy is an action-packed waste of brain power Lucy Universal Pictures Scarlett Johansson in ""Lucy."" Scarlett Johansson in ""Lucy."" (Universal Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter What would happen if someone were able to access 100% of their brain power? Lucy is the result Something like the offspring of a shotgun marriage between Carl Sagan and Quentin Tarantino the Scarlett Johansson-starring ""Lucy"" is part philosophical/scientific treatise part action movie a film that goes from mayhem to boredom in a heartbeat.""Lucys"" writer-director is French veteran Luc Besson whose creative personality is similarly split between auteur aspirations and mainstream success (including co-writing and producing Liam Neesons ""Taken"" series). His films have often featured female action heroes -- 1990s ""La Femme Nikita"" is one of his signature works -- and its not surprising that Universal is trying to sell ""Lucy"" as something similar. Instead ""Lucy"" is an eccentric idiosyncratic riff founded on the oft-expressed notion that human beings use only 10% of their brain capacity. What would happen Besson wonders if someone were able to access all 100%? What would that look like? What would that even mean? As Lucy herself asks provocatively at the start ""Life was given to us a billion years ago. What have we done with it?""Before we get to all the hard-core scientific stuff some down and dirty exposition has to be gotten out of the way. Lucy is presented as a standard-issue party girl going to school in Taiwan a dim innocent who is manipulated by her scumbag boyfriend into taking a locked metal case into a high-end hotel and asking for a certain Mr. Jang. As played by Korean actor Choi Min-sik (the star of ""Oldboy"") Mr. Jang turns out to be a totally evil drug dealer introduced literally washing the blood off his hands after personally dishing out the kind of rough justice evil drug dealers are known for dispensing. Lucy trailer The trailer for the movie ""Lucy."" The trailer for the movie ""Lucy."" See more videos Inside that metal case as it happens are several bags containing strange blue crystals a newly created drug of unimaginable power. Its called CPH4 and is said to be the synthetic version of a substance pregnant mothers secrete to help their fetuses grow ""For a baby"" someone portentously says ""it packs the power of an atomic bomb.""Much against her will Lucy is shanghaied into being a drug mule and has to submit to a bag of this blue stuff being sewn into her stomach -- not to mention having leering gangsters threaten her with other kinds of humiliations. Lucy Jessica Forde / Universal Pictures Morgan Freeman left and Scarlett Johansson in ""Lucy."" Morgan Freeman left and Scarlett Johansson in ""Lucy."" (Jessica Forde / Universal Pictures) Intercut with all these depredations are shots of a Paris-based professor named Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman) nominally one of the worlds reigning experts on the human brain giving a series of droning lectures bemoaning that we use so little of our mental capacity. The professors lectures indeed the entire film are for some reason shot through with so many clips of animal behavior that its possible to feel youre watching a season of ""Wild Kingdom."" Its not every action film that has a closing credit for ""Indian Rhino mating footage"" but this one does.Brutal mistreatment at the hands of Lucys captors leads to the bag in her stomach bursting and all of a sudden the Juice Is Loose. That incredibly powerful drug gets released into Lucys bloodstream and she is soon literally climbing the walls as large type on the screen shows us what percentage of brain power she is using (Hint Its always getting higher.)The first scenes of the drug kicking in are ""Lucys"" most conventional and most entertaining as our heroine discovers an escalating series of superpowers She can read minds learn new languages instantly is impervious to pain stuff like that.Lucy uses her abilities to take revenge on some of the people who did her in but gradually as her powers increase and she becomes one with the universe it becomes clear that no human being on Earth is ever going to touch her let alone some ragtag bunch of drug dealers out to get even.Of course these drug dealers dont know that so Besson throws in several pro forma gun battles and even a car chase down the crowded sidewalk of Paris Rue de Rivoli but his heart is not in action-set pieces but rather in peculiar speculation about the nature of reality and the meaning of life.So what suspense the film has is focused on whether in collaboration with Professor Norman Lucy can convey all shes learned via her Yoda-like mastery of space and time (""I remember the taste of your milk in my mouth"" she tells her flabbergasted mother) and help the puny human race advance. We are not worthy Lucy were really not.------------LucyMPAA rating R for strong violence disturbing images and sexualityRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Column Entertainment Action (Movie Genre) Oldboy (movie) Liam Neeson Scarlett Johansson Hero vs. superhuman Hercules to battle Lucy in weekend box office Luc Besson lets Scarlett Johansson play smart in Lucy Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-lucy-review-20140725-column.html,200,lucy2,lucy,latimes

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jul 25 2014 Culture Every now and then a movie comes along thats so beyond-the-pale sloppy so disastrous in both conceit and execution that it simply defies conventional analysis. It happened with The Happening. There was something unspeakably wrong with The Words. And Broken City was utterly beyond repair.So too with Lucy writer/director/producer Luc Bessons mind-bendingly miscalculated sci-fi vehicle for Scarlett Johansson. In its defense I can offer only that Johansson is a moderately charismatic presence (despite playing a character who barely qualifies as a character) and that the film clocks in at a mercifully brief 89 minutes. That said the sheer quantity of inanity that Besson squeezes into his limited screen time beggars that of awful movies of substantially greater length.Lucy is so idiotic that the only way to properly convey its flaws is to enumerate them.Consequently what follows is not a review but a spoilereview. If you are genuinely considering watching Lucy--and I urgently recommend that you reconsider--you should stop reading now. If by contrast you plan to give the movie a pass and would like to have your good judgment ratified (or alternatively if you have stumbled out of the theater bewildered and seeking commiseration) read on. Because while Besson has made very very bad films in the past--most recently last years The Family--this is the first time he has made a film so idiotic that the only way to properly convey its flaws is to enumerate them.1. The movies first image is of a single cell shimmying in the light; then in huge letters ""Scarlett Johansson""; then the cell dividing via mitosis into two identical duplicates and then four. This is what is referred to in Hollywood as ""wishful thinking.""2. We watch as an early hominid Australopithecus drinks water from a stream a few million years ago. In voiceover Johansson asks us ""Life was given to us a billion years ago. What have we done with it?"" Flash forward to a montage of modern metropolises buzzing away full of cars and buses and skyscrapers and clothed people engaging in spoken language. Was Johanssons question rhetorical? Because it actually seems as though weve accomplished quite a lot since we were naked and furry drinking water from streams.3. Ah but now were in Taipei and we get the point. A moderately unkempt Johansson--her characters name is ""Lucy"" and she is a student though the latter fact is entirely irrelevant--is talking to a chump in a beard and foolish sunglasses outside a fancy office building. This is what she meant about our having wasted a billion years of life on Earth However much we may have evolved otherwise some of us--even some who look like Scarlett Johansson--still date jerks as self-evident as this one. This regrettable beau (theyve been together a week) confirms the lesson by telling Lucy against all available evidence that hes recently visited a museum. There he made the discovery that ""The first woman was named Lucy."" Yes that was the Australopithecus we saw by the stream. Yes this is the kind of movie we are in for.Related Story The Family Unsuitable for All Ages 4. Now its time for some plot though Im being generous with the term Lucys semi-boyfriend is acting as a courier transporting a small silver briefcase to someone in the office building. But hes had trouble with building security in the past so he asks her to take it in for him--he assures her its ""only paperwork""--and to deliver it to a ""Mr. Jang."" When she declines he handcuffs her to the case claiming that only Jang has the combination. So Lucy reluctantly goes into the building asks for Jang and is whisked upstairs by goons. The boyfriend is immediately executed which can only be regarded as a relief all around.5. Intercut with the previous scene is footage of a cheetah stalking and ultimately downing an antelope on the Serengeti. (Besson was evidently among the very few fans of Ridley Scotts The Counselor.) Its a metaphor you see for the bad guys who are closing in on helpless Lucy. In a little while well be treated a few more nature reels though these will be used in a more literal fashion. After that the movie will abandon the gimmick altogether. Rarely does one have the acute real-time experience of watching a film recognize that one of its principal stylistic flourishes is so lame that it must be summarily discarded.6. But back to Lucy. Upstairs she meets Jang who is the kind of businessman who brutally murders people while wearing a 10000 suit and then rinses the gore off his hands with Evian. (Hes played by South Korean actor Choi Min-sik of Oldboy fame.) Jang speaks no English nor do any of the many flunkies attending him which seems odd for a big-time Taipei businessman. So he calls an interpreter on the phone in order to communicate with Lucy. He then has her open the case which contains a crystalline blue powder. His goons wheel in a junkie to test the stuff. After one snort the junkie starts giggling wildly and they shoot him. Then Jang offers Lucy a ""job"" she says no and one of the goons punches her in the face.7. Its around this time that were introduced to our secondary star Morgan Freeman brought in with the obvious (though wildly unsuccessful) mission of lending scientific and philosophical gravitas to the proceedings. Freeman plays a renowned neuroscientist ""Professor Norman"" (no first name necessary) who is delivering a lecture to a packed crowd of well-heeled attendees. He explains that most species use only 3-5 percent of their ""cerebral capacity"" that human beings use 10 percent--a complete falsehood incidentally--and that dolphins use 20 percent. (So long and thanks for all the fish) He goes so far as to suggest that if we used more of our own brainpower wed be able to echolocate too though hes mum on the question of whether this would require us to wander around clicking all the time.8. In addition to offering a variety of silly daily-calendar-level bromides Professor Norman makes the point that when endangered species focus on self-preservation but when circumstances are safe they focus on reproduction. This is an excuse for the second (and last) phase of the wildlife footage in which we have an opportunity to watch a variety of creatures (rhinoceroses tropical frogs) humping. I have no doubt that there is a fetish community devoted to such fare but I suspect it requires a more rarefied taste than that of the average summer moviegoer.That human beings use only 10 percent of their ""cerebral capacity"" is a complete falsehood incidentally.9. Back to Lucy. When she awakes from her punch to the face shes taken to a fancy high-rise office suite offered a drink in a cut-crystal glass and told shes had a minor surgery to implant a packet of that blue-powdery drug called CPH4 in her abdomen. She and a trio of other mules are to smuggle the drugs back to their home countries where theyll be retrieved by Jangs men.9a. A side note When told about her unwanted surgery Lucy replies ""I dont care about the scar."" Attentive viewers may recall that Johansson made light of a nearly identical injury/blemish in Captain America The Winter Soldier. Is this a thing now? Is 2014 the year of the Scar-Jo abdominal scar?10. Lucy is inexplicably taken to a cell that is as dingy as the office suite was opulent. There a guard sexually harasses her and then kicks her in the stomach exactly where the packet of drugs is stashed. Youd think that a massively well-financed international drug cartel would remember to tell its heavies not to do this. The drug seeps into her system and onscreen text shows us that she has now hit 20 percent of her cerebral capacity. Alas she does not start echolocating. Instead she immediately begins to levitate. (Take that dolphins)11. As the movie progresses we will regularly be kept abreast of Lucys increasing cerebral capacity (30 percent 60 percent). Its a useful tool enabling viewers to judge just how much more of the movie they will have to endure before she hits 100 and its over.12. A non-comprehensive list of the powers Lucy acquires over the course of the film perfect marksmanship extreme agility and instantaneous reflexes; the ability to control TVs and cell phones from thousands of miles away; immunity to pain and fear; telepathy telekinesis and clairvoyance; expertise in driving a car really fast into oncoming traffic; teleportation across time and space; and the capacity to alter her existing body parts or grow new ones. The one power she doesnt seem to have--oddly given the initial levitation--is flight. This is presumably because if she did Besson would have no excuse to have her exercise her aforementioned car-driving skills to create rampant vehicular mayhem in Paris. But Im getting ahead of myself.13. So to recap A small amount of CPH4 makes you giggle. Somewhat more begins giving you all the powers noted above. Does this not make Mr. Jang the most inept criminal mastermind of all time? Why sell the stuff to junkies when you could use it to create an army of super-soldiers or to grant yourself god-like powers? And how can it be that no one else in the film witnessing Lucys remarkable paranormal abilities thinks ""Hey maybe I should try a little of that CPH4 myself"" Half the film is spent chasing down the packets stashed in the other mules yet despite rampant opportunities no one other than Lucy ever actually takes any of this all-powerful super-drug.14. A couple more choice bits from Professor Normans speech which is still being interspersed with the main plot He notes with self-satisfaction that the human race needs to advance from ""evolution to revolution"" which his upscale audience applauds enthusiastically suggesting that they cant tell the difference between a genuine insight and a sneaker ad. He also laments that ""We dont know anything more than a dog that watches the moon."" I fear that on the basis of this film it might be plausibly presumed that we actually know less.15. But back again to Lucy and the central plot. She learns Chinese in a few minutes and busts out of her cell and into a hospital. There she shoots a patient on the operating table and dumps the body onto the floor to make room for the surgeons to instead operate on her to remove the CPH4 from her abdomen. (This is an okay thing for her to do because shes also taught herself enough radiology and oncology to be confident that the other patient was going to die anyway.) The very concerned doctors explain to Lucy that CPH4 is a substance that occurs naturally in women during their sixth week of pregnancy (note its not) that gives fetuses the ""energy"" to build their skeletal structure. How this fits in with everything else weve been told about ""cerebral capacity"" is left to viewers to puzzle out. Moreover again how is it that a bunch of random Chinese ER doctors seem to know more about the power and perils of CPH4 than say the pharmaceutical industry the military-industrial complex and the actual global crime syndicate that is smuggling the drug around the world?Lucys mom doesnt ask the question that any other parent in the world would ""Are you on drugs?""16. While the doctors are operating on Lucy she calls her mother back in the States. The first thing mom asks is whether Lucy is partying too much which suggests (along with other hints along the way) that she may have had lifestyle-related issues in the past. Lucy says no shes fine and then proceeds to go on a stream-of-consciousness soliloquy about all the things she can now thanks to her enhanced cerebral capacity remember with perfect accuracy--every kiss mom ever gave her a cat they had when she was one-year-old etc. It all culminates with this doozy ""I remember the taste of your milk in my mouth."" (Needless to say this is a line that I will spend the remainder of the summer trying to un-remember.) The truly crazy part however is that after this long super-creepy monologue Lucys mom doesnt ask the question that any parent in the world would ask under the circumstances ""Are you on drugs?"" Instead its just Thanks for calling hon. Great to catch up. Kudos on that whole recovered memory about the taste of my breast milk.17. Lucy busts back into Jangs place stabs him through both hands and reads his mind to discover the destinations of her three fellow mules specifically Paris Berlin and Rome. My first thought was that Besson assumed that these are the only European cities with which an American audience would be familiar. But no its worse than that When the mules arrive at their stops onscreen text announces ""Paris - France"" ""Berlin - Germany"" and ""Rome - Italy."" This is doubtless to assist dimly provincial Americans who might otherwise have thought the mules were all headed for Texas which has its own Paris Berlin and Rhome.18. Lucy calls a policeman in Paris and tells him to alert law enforcement in the other two cities. She also gets in touch with Professor Norman who is conveniently visiting Paris himself. She tells him that shell be at his door in 12 hours which is impressive given that a nonstop flight from Taipei to Paris takes a couple hours more than that and she hasnt even headed to the airport yet. Is she bending time? Using her mind to make commercial airlines move faster? Put me on a flight with that girlRelated Story Scarlett Johansson Has the Most Human Moment in The Avengers 19. Okay Lucys not even at 30 percent yet and this exercise is already beginning to feel as lengthy and punishing as watching the movie itself. So lets start wrapping things up by noting that from here out almost nothing of narrative consequence occurs. After a brief interlude in which Lucy starts disintegrating on her flight she arrives safely in Paris and drives past the Tuileries at ill-advised velocity causing a large number of presumably fatal car wrecks. She the crime lord Jang the other mules her new policeman friend and about 500 French cops and Asian gangsters converge on a hospital where the latter two groups shoot at one another interminably except for a brief lull when Lucy intervenes and makes everybody float through the air helplessly. She meets Professor Norman and some colleagues of his who despite their accumulated scientific wisdom do nothing except gape at how awesome she is and then help her to take all the CPH4 in order to crank it up to 11 and achieve 100 percent cerebral capacity.20. Along the way Lucy explains that ""sounds are music that I can understand like fluids."" I just had to get that line in. There are a dozen others nearly as bad/good.21. She kisses the French policeman as a ""reminder"" of her humanity.22. At 70 percent Lucy starts vomiting pure energy and light.23. At 80 percent she grows slithery black tendrils and transports Professor Norman and his colleagues with her into an all-white limbo kind of like where Harry Potter went when he was dead in that last movie.24. At 90 percent she begins journeying through space and time while wearing a black cocktail dress and sitting in a cut-rate ergonomic office chair. (She couldnt at least conjure herself a nice Aeron?) She visits Times Square meets some American Indians and encounters dinosaurs constructed out of CGI so primitive they look like a first-generation game on a Nintendo DSi.25. 99 percent...26. At 100 percent Lucy vanishes out of her cocktail dress at the exact moment that an inconceivably still-alive Jang shows up to shoot her. What has become of our heroine? One of the random scientists gasps ""Look The computer--its moving."" And indeed the machine which is now also sporting slithery black tendrils is forming something new an object that it wants to offer to Professor Norman. Its slender and obsidian and dotted with shimmering points of light. Is it some kind of otherworldly totem or talisman? No its a.... flash drive.I promise that I am not making this up.Johansson closes the movie with a voiceover echoing the one that opened the film ""Life was given to us a billion years ago. Now you know what to do with it.""Thats right. What we are meant to ""do"" with this precious gift of life our highest destiny and the final stage of human development is to take massive quantities of drugs so that we can all leave our mortal flesh behind and evolve into glittery disco flash drives. Now you know.Update March 2015 If you enjoyed this you may want to take a look at my spoilereview of the Sean Penn vanity action flick The Gunman.

Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

His is a voice of authority tempered by warmth and wisdom capable of evoking felt human experience and the majesty of creation. In writer-director Luc Bessons taut fun Lucy Freeman narrates several documentary sequences of soulful unscientific horseshit about the human brain. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Its not as if anyone will go all ""Mythbusters"" on Lucy as Neil deGrasse Tyson does on Gravity but its fair to say that only people who actually use 10 percent of their brain capacity still believe that humans only use 10 percent of their brain capacity. But thats the whole premise of Lucy in which Besson classes up a pulp-superhero plot with half-understood evolutionary science and that old smelly percentage-based chestnut about brains. None of that matters; it makes exactly as much sense as a radioactive spider bite or an overdose of gamma radiation. Bessons film is about a woman who needs to find the meaning of life in a serious hurry. He opens Lucy with the image of a woman manipulated psychologically and physically by a man who keeps grabbing her arm so she cant walk away; he concludes with the image of a woman who men literally cant touch. Film Details Lucy RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time89 More Info Trailer Scarlett Johansson carries the film effortlessly bridging Bessons narrative and logical ellipses by fully embracing his crowd-pleasing intentions and convincingly depicting Lucys psychological transformation. While Johansson is a high-status figure and a giant movie star she lacks Maleficent-grade remoteness alternating between accessible vulnerability and dispassionate violence without losing the audiences empathy. Probably because she only uses 10 percent of her brains capacity Lucy an American student living in Taiwan fails to recognize her new boyfriends corn curl-shaped cowboy hat as an obvious creep signifier. Bullied into delivering a mysterious briefcase to a Taiwanese syndicate boss (Choi Min-sik) shes knocked unconscious and wakes up with a bag of an experimental drug sewn into her abdominal cavity. Its a synthetic version of a human growth factor and when the bag breaks open the overdose stimulates Lucys brain into an evolutionary process that heightens her senses and gifts her with superhuman powers of cognition and memory. Besson tracks her cognition meters increase with title cards -- at 20 percent brain capacity she can shoot around corners; at 30 percent she can see through walls. Ultimately she controls physics and matter with her mind. So thats the mobs plan to sell a transhumanism-inducing drug to club kids which futurist Ray Kurzweil probably never saw coming. Chased by police and the mob Lucy travels halfway around the world in pursuit of the other drug mules. However gaudy and baroque Bessons films can become the director has a core of sincerity that drives (and sometimes overpowers) his films. Lucy with her enhanced neurology burning brightly and quickly becomes aware that the drug will kill her in 24 hours. Amid the films cross fire of revenge confrontations shoot-outs and gravity-flouting car chases Besson includes a surprisingly poignant moment in which Lucy whose personality is evaporating in the heat of her transformation makes a sad final telephone call to her mother. In a hurry to find the meaning of life before the drug burns her up she turns to Freemans Professor Norman a famous evolutionary biologist and stirring voice-over narrator. He tells her that the meaning of life may be to do what individual cells do pass on their genetic knowledge to a new generation. This Promethean task becomes Lucys quest and the films arc which vectors toward an unexpectedly huge and cosmic finale -- one perhaps best explained in the warm sonorous tones with which the best life-affirming science-y bullshit is conveyed.1 Photo by Jessica Forde - (c) Universal Pictures Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Chris Packham Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"No Brain No Gain << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The All-Bad Contracts Team  Next Sports Movie or Not a Sports Movie? Facebook Twitter Print Movies No Brain No Gain Scarlett Johansson is inhuman again in Lucy while Dwayne Johnson is wasted in Hercules. by Wesley Morris on July 25 2014 Lovers of Scarlett Johansson savor the opening minutes of Lucy. Shes sucking on a straw outside a bank in Taipei. Her haircut is short but big and curly and entrancingly blonde. The mischief in her eyes matches the tinge of trouble in her low rich voice. The jungle cat-print jacket seals the deal. She looks like everybody Madonna has ever played in a movie -- but at the same time. The bozo boyfriend shes talking to really wants her to help him out but shes like ""I totally have to study"" and hes like ""Come on babe. Help me out and take this briefcase in there."" Theyre kind of playing. Theyre kind of not. Suddenly he gets weird on her and cuffs her to the case causing Lucy to flash a look of terrible shock. Yada yada yada Lucys a skittish drug mule for Korean gangsters. When the drug leaks into her system she goes from using 10 percent of her brain like the rest of us to using all of it. Some chick studying abroad becomes the Future of Civilization. Or whatever it is Luc Besson is going for with this. Lucys rising intelligence is inversely proportional to the movies. But its stupidity has the kick you expect from the man whos been writing and producing Taken movies. For once Morgan Freeman is not the voice of omniscience. Hes a baffled scientist whose tens of thousands of pages of research Lucy read in an instant. Shes on her way to his Paris lab and shes dragging with her a bewildered cop (Amr Waked) a few of his men and all of those gangsters led by Choi Min-sik. Besson is having some queasy fun. Isnt this just a white lady running from a bunch of crazy Asians? Once the movie has an uncomprehending Lucy shoot a Taiwanese guy for comedy. Much of the reason the opening scenes are so good has to do with a loose breezy Johanssons dominating performance. Hearing that voice come from that face seeing her playing a person revved me up. I didnt know whether to dab my eyes or fasten my seat belt You mean shes not going to be software or a man-killing seductress-alien? Thank you Luc Besson. But it doesnt take long for the light in Johanssons eyes to dim and an action film to take her over. The more brilliant -- and telepathic telekinetic and daring like a 1970s stunt driver -- she becomes the less human she is. Theres no malice in Bessons use of Johansson. He can be a zigzagging amusing feminist director building spectacles around everyone from Anne Parillaud and Milla Jovovich (each of whom were at one point his wife) to Michelle Yeoh as the shut-away Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi to Michelle Pfeiffer as the head of nuclear family of assassins. He likes his idea of female power which is like male power but in sleeveless tops. One letter separates Lucys name from Bessons. You just have to ignore the double meaning of that letter ""y."" What you feel from Besson to Johansson is an absurd love. She fascinates him just as deeply as she does Spike Jonze in Her and Jonathan Glazer in Under the Skin. Taken together the films constitute some kind of investigation of her essence and sexuality of the fantasy her stardom presents. But she seems very much a partner in that exploration not a victim of it. All the probing is making her stronger as a performer. Its not mere carnality she projects in these movies its variations on wonder What can I do as an alien life-form pretending to be a beautiful woman? What can I do with a role that denies me physical form? Johansson does more than experiment in these movies. Shes terrific in all three. Its just curious to me that filmmakers as different as Besson Glazer and Jonze are interested in her as something other than human something beyond it. And in The Island she was a clone for Michael Bay At the risk of indelicacy you wonder what female directors would see in Johansson at this point. Its not as if she hasnt been good as a civilian or what passes for one. I liked her as Black Widow for Marvel and thought her zookeeper in Cameron Crowes last movie We Bought a Zoo showed her talent starting to crest. In Joseph Gordon-Levitts Don Jon Johansson seemed to be working at a sharp new angle. But what might she and Sofia Coppola achieve in a rematch? Where would the stress fall on her range? Lucy doesnt give Johansson much to do as an actor. Touchingly Besson seems to think that in order to give her all the power in the world he has to take away her skill. When the drug starts to do funny things to Lucy on an airplane Besson even risks taking away her beauty not to punish her but to punish us. Thats temporary. For most of the films back half Johansson can be seen waving her arms like wands and sitting perfectly still while wearing a little black dress. Holding on to that body feels like an act of willful sentimentality. Whats wrong with this movie? Its a cut above this springs Transcendence in which the Internet is infected with the Johnny Depp virus. That movie believed it was saying something but it was too wimpy to take its point about overconnectivity to some exciting or disturbing extreme. It had Freeman in the same role but no vision. Besson has too many visions. This movie worries that humanity is wasting its potential which is a bizarre fear for a movie that has this many nonsensical shootouts. But thats what on Bessons mind the Big Bang and bang-bang. Its simultaneously fun and extremely boring up to something provocative and yet the same old same old. Still some of that same old is fun. How many directors have left one of the five-star hotels on the Rue de Rivoli and thought whats been missing for all of these centuries is a car chase through the famous arcades? Well Bessons gone and done it. Subtlety is his kryptonite. Here and there he spikes the action with shots from the animal kingdom mice stepping onto a cheesed trap a cheetah trotting off with an antelope dangling between its fangs. In one of the opening shots prehistoric man is crouched by a lake waiting perhaps for a plunk from the bone in 2001 A Space Odyssey. The movie rumbles through time and space sending dinosaurs pyramids and nebulae toward Johansson and us. Theres both amazement in these shots and braggadocio. Its as if Besson sat through a half-hour of Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life hit fast-forward and thought I can do that but with drugs and guns and car chases. Malick gave us gaseous galactic emissions. Besson is farting. Theres a great movie in Brett Ratner. [Stops typing. Backs away from computer. Braces for strike of lightning. Nothing? Resumes.] He might never allow himself to make it. He might not even believe he can. (He might think After the Sunset and The Family Man already are great.) But you look at the battle scenes in Hercules and after wondering why youre watching yet another of these sequences in which hundreds of real and digitized fighters run toward each other you notice how navigable they are. Most of the cutting keeps the action matched so that when a character tackles an extra you can follow the approach impact and thud. The clubbing and stabbing and leaping Its all senseless yes but its assembled in a way that makes sense too. Working with the cinematographer Dante Spinotti for the ninth time Ratner even shoots the scenes in daylight which adds a touch of honesty to the action. Continuity and clarity are absurd things to single out for praise. In the homes of most directors even so-so ones thats called filmmaking. But even in something as run-of-the-mill as this the crispness of some of the staging is impressive. Its a crispness that eludes men like Christopher Nolan and Peter Jackson. Even so until the campy action-movie scenes in the last 25 minutes I was bored -- and honestly no matter how well put together one of those melees is if youve seen one youre all set. This Hercules (Dwayne Johnson) is not a persecuted demigod (most of his 12 labors have been completed) but a woebegone warrior ""from the streets of Athens."" Rumor has it that his wife and children were slain by his own hand. Obviously the rumors will be dispelled. In the meantime hes moonlighting with a band of five acolytes (including Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell) roving Thrace while doing mercenary work for sacks of gold. It sounds like the gist of a bad 1980s show on todays Starz. (Coming this winter The Slay Team) In this episode a woman named Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson) comes to Hercules on behalf of her father Lord Cotys (John Hurt). He needs his agrarian subjects trained for war against Thrace. Hercules and the acolytes agree to help and together they create a farmy. But the plot twists and Hercules finds himself in chains at which point the movies energy picks up along with its sense of abandon. Presumably the credited screenwriters (Ryan J. Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos) will hear that the last quarter is livelier than the first three and say they were building toward that last act. What theyve built is basically as strong as a coat of paint. And yet they should be a little proud of this greasy script. Theyve conflated Greek history and mythology -- or adapted Steve Moore and Admira Wijayas graphic novel that did. The writing has amusing lines for McShane and Sewell and a bitchy part for Joseph Fiennes as the King of Athens to tip into Cleopatra. That last scene is unsurprising but its also fun. There just isnt enough of that. Really Hercules wastes Johnson. Hes got the right body for the role (redonkulous) but deploys the wrong temperament Hes too passive too agreeable. You dont want to hear Johnson with lines like ""never retreat"" and ""advaaaaaaaaaance"" not when Hurt Sewell McShane Fiennes and Peter Mullan as a shady general are using toothpicks to pluck scenery from between their teeth. Johnson wears a brunette wig and makeup that doesnt always completely hide his body art. (What was I saying about continuity?) Hes been given one anachronistic line of foul language and whether or not it was in the graphic novel it seems included because the U.K. actors had all the fun stuff to say. This feels like something Johnson might have done 12 years ago when he was still wrestling full-time as the Rock but wanted to bank on his movie-star charisma. That smile of his is great in the ring. Its right up there with Julia Robertss. In films though its often more like a grimace. The point of leaving the Rock behind was to keep Johnson out of stuff like this and to take more risks like the juiced-up idiot crook he played in Pain amp; Gain. We know he can shove a towering statue onto a fleet of men. For years thats basically what he did for Vince McMahon. Of course he also needs a hit and Hercules should do it. But you leave underwhelmed. He and Ratner should be doing more than pushing over fake marble. They should be pushing themselves.

JESSICA FORDE  UNIVERSAL PICTURES BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Scarlett Johansson stars in ""Lucy"" as a woman who accidently ingests a drug that supercharges her brain and leave her convinced she has roughly a day to live.   UNIVERSAL PICTURES LucyStarring Scarlett Johansson Morgan Freeman Directed by Luc Besson Rated R for strong violence disturbing images and sexuality Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitA gory flashy sci-fi fantasia about a woman using 100 percent of her brain and an actor Scarlett Johansson releasing 100 percent of her talent in the most unlikely circumstances. GradeB Sci-fi trash rarely gets flashier juicier or more low-down entertaining than ""Lucy"" a movie that dramatizes what it would be like to exploit 100 percent of the brain and it does so without taxing 1 percent of a filmgoers brainpower. Written and directed by the master or rather maitre of French commercial cinema Luc Besson the movie pits Scarlett Johansson in the title role an American student partying hard in Taipei Taiwan against a merciless gangster Mr. Jang (Choi Min-sik) whose minions sew a pouch of a hazardous synthetic substance inside her stomach. Shes supposed to become a carrier for a potent new recreational drug. Its actually a man-made version of CPH4 which pregnant women produce during natal development to give a fetus the power and energy to grow bones. When Lucy fights with one of her jailers the CPH4 leaks into her system catalyzing billions of new connections inside her head. It makes her superhuman then beyond human. ""Lucy"" winds up like a comic-book inner-space version of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" dedicated to the proposition that humankinds next great leap forward will come from within. In this film we carry our own white-walled rooms and black slabs inside our brains. Lucy estimates that she has 24 hours to live in her accelerated condition. Will she be able to intercept carriers set to land in Berlin Paris and Rome where Jang intends to peddle his stuff to Eurotrash? Will one new friend - a French cop Pierre del Rio (Amr Waked) - be able to hold off Jang and his Jangsters long enough so she can download her knowledge for her other new friend Professor Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman) the world authority on brain use? Draping the action on this pulp hanger allows Besson to indulge himself with snazzy editing schemes and visual effects while testing how far he can push the amazingly resourceful Johansson into extreme states of being. At the start the sadistic/horrific black comedy is too thick and prolonged. And an extended sequence of vehicular mayhem in Paris includes too many jazzed-up cliches like a wrong-way car chase. To go from a B film to an A Lucys battle powers would have to be either simple intense and stylized or breathtakingly baroque. Halting assassins by ramming them up into ceilings via telekinesis? Thats so 1970s. Happily the movies brash overall style is very 70s too. Heres some of what Besson cuts into the action as Professor Norman lectures to the Sorbonne and Lucy gets a grip on whats happening rapid-fire montages of wildlife rutting (the credits include a thanks to Howard Hall Productions for ""Indian rhino mating""); a caveman inventing fire and sparking mans industrial creativity; and Lucys namesake the possible ""missing link"" between mankind and the ape world kneeling by a stream and staring into the camera as if to ask ""Who are you people?"" Later Besson illustrates Lucys fired-up neurons with beautiful cosmic birth pangs caught by NASA telescopes. Eye-popping outer-space fogs drift into gale-blasted intergalactic ""canyons"" with streaks of nascent stars. The wizards at George Lucas Industrial Light amp; Magic do their most uncanny work in years visualizing the glittering lines of energy seen by a woman who can tune into whatever lies under the skin or bark or wire and whatever streams into the Cloud. (At one point Lucy parts these lines like a curtain.) In the showiest sequence Lucys body starts exploding into bursts of confetti. Even then Johannson holds everything together. Shes the rare actress who brings conviction and clarity to flights of fancy. She seems credibly touched when Lucy taps into previously unfelt memories going back to mothers milk. As the heroine crosses known boundaries of time and space Johansson creates her own charismatic blend of intuition and brilliance. She brings out the humor in Lucys omniscience and engages Freemans professor in some deadpan drolleries. Not playing God for a change Freeman is a cosmic straight man as charming and unflappable as that other show-biz God George Burns. The film playfully suggests that a fleeting contact between Johannsons Lucy and Lucy the hominid prompted the rise of Homo sapiens. I hope so. It would mean that our species has at root some smart and sturdy genes.

Jessica Forde/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Video Trailer Lucy Monitor Movie Guide Luc Besson makes nonsensical movies and so of course he was the perfect writer-director for ""Lucy"" a Scarlett Johansson headliner about an American expat in Taiwan who runs afoul of the local mob and ends up accidentally ingesting a blue crystal drug - dont ask - and becoming supersmart. Were not talking the usual 10% brainpower smart here. As the action ramps up the screen flashes her ascending cerebral wattage first 20% (putting her on a par with dolphins apparently) and then moving on up the scale to 100% at which point she can do just about anything - except I would wager make sense of this movie. I know were supposed to think that Bessons daffy cinematic calisthenics are entertaining because at least they are not boring. But I was bored. It didnt help that Morgan Freeman shows up as a brainy scientist explaining everything to us in his deepest intonations. When was the last time Freeman a great actor really acted?

Reverse climate change? Pick up new languages while you sleep? Pay your rent on time? Invent an iPhone capable of making and receiving telephone calls? More important Would you savor the salty crunchy hot-buttered freshness of writer-director-mogul Luc Bessons wiggedy-wack but truly madly deeply watchable thriller Lucy -- a Ritalin-spiked pixy stick of a movie that pinches almost as much from Tree of Life as it does from The Matrix -- even more? Or considerably less? If its the latter then I pity you Mr. or Ms. Fully Self-Actualized. Look this was already Scarlett Johanssons year Just in the past eight months shes given movie-elevating performances as the voice of Samantha the self-aware operating system in Her (way to steal a film where we never even see you); as the canny covert operative Black Widow in Captain America The Winter Soldier (way not to get buried amid all that expensive pixel-smashing); and most spectacularly as a mysterious being on a mysterious mission in Under the Skin 2014s most purely cinematic film to date. Though made for a modest 13 million its recouped less than 20 percent of that in U.S. theatrical receipts. This is why we cant have nice movies America. (In fact weve had rather a lot of them this summer no?) Anyway Lucy feels like the pre-chewed multiplex companion piece to that art house provocation and a victory lap for its fascinating star. It isnt how you say smart but -- like last months terrific Edge of Tomorrow -- its smarter than you expect. Which adjusted for blockbuster inflation and high fructose corn syrup intake feels like Very Smart Indeed at least for the svelte 89 minutes of your life this film demands. At last a would-be summer blockbuster that respects your time Arriving on the heels of the fifth Spider-Man and the seventh X-Men Lucy channels the ""Hey Kids -- SCIENCE"" spirit of early 60s Marvel Comics more truly than either of them. In those scripts that Stan ""The Man"" Lee used to grind out at a rate of six or seven per month exposure to radiation invariably conferred superpowers instead of cancer. Well. Lucy does for recreational drugs what The Fantastic Four did for Gamma Rays. If the overdose is massive enough and the dope powerful enough it unlocks doors previously accessible only to those whove read The Secret. Or Flowers for Algernon. For the first 10 minutes our Lucy (ScarJo) is just a party-loving American expat in Taipei who has fallen in with a really wrong crowd. A family of mobsters commanded by Choi Min-sik -- the South Korean star of Park Chan-wooks admirably sick-minded international hit Oldboy -- sews a bag of superdope inside her gut against her will which is as every bit as gross and terrifying as it sounds. When the bag ruptures instead of expiring in a blast of endorphin-soaked euphoria our Lucy finds herself crabwalkin on the ceiling like Linda Blair. Or Lionel Ritchie. Or Spider-Pig depending on what decade this is. But these are mere growing pains on the bumpy road to post-biological omnipotence (so long deodorant Smell ya later dental floss) a road that -- as Brilliant Neuroscientist or Something Dr. Morgan Freeman Ph.D. (Morgan Freeman) explains in a lecture at LAcademie du Cinema la Fausee Science et Exposition thats intercut with the drug-smuggling story -- we too could travel If We Only Had The Full Use of Our Pre-Installed Brain as the song goes. Its actually a different Suspiciously Well-Informed Movie Doctor who has the duty of explaining to ScarJo that the stuff in her system is in fact a synthetic version of a chemical expectant mothers produce naturally to nourish the babies in their wombs. As that baby formula swims through her all-grown-up bloodstream ScarJo begins another cycle of rapid evolution developing the ability to manipulate her body at the cellular level to see and manipulate radio waves and eventually to surf the space-time continuum from an office chair. Which is not where I was expecting this movie to go. Sorry whats that? Yes of course shes gonna take care of the rapey tatted-up creeps who tried to make her their drug mule. Lucy goes from tearful sheep to cold-eyed wolf in one scene but why make us wait? After efficiently sating our bloodlust for those degenerates the movie gets on to other more interesting business. Namely Lucy has to get herself to Dr. Freeman so her unprecedented advance in human evolution can be observed and documented and written about in goop magazine. She also needs to acquire the rest of the stash -- there were other mules you see -- ""for medicinal purposes"" as she deadpans. (This is a movie that confidently understands what its druggies want More drugs ALL OF THE DRUGS) Besson -- best known for the odd and visually rich action pictures La Femme Nikita Leon The Professional and The Fifth Element -- churns out films at a tireless pace but its been a long while since a picture he directed made much of a splash in Cinemas americains. Last year his witness protection comedy The Family did a fast fade despite the presence of Robert De Niro Tommy Lee Jones and the too-seldom-seen Michelle Pfeiffer. We tend to prefer the Transporter and Taken franchises wherein Besson credited as a writer and producer seems to scribble a few notes on a bar napkin and leave the stunt coordinators to work out the rest. (Which is not to deny Liam Neesons A Very Particular Set of Skills telephone monologue from Taken its rightful place as the St. Crispins Day speech of the 21st century.) Lucy is a welcome reminder of just how much Bessons wry sensibility as a filmmaker adds to movies like this. It opens with a shamelessly prurient extreme close-up of cell division while Eric Serras vaguely porn-y slow-jam score bumps and grinds along. When Lucy is in danger Besson (who also edited the picture) cuts to shots of a big cat stalking a gazelle. Later we get flashes of animals (and humans) mating and giving birth a real-time channel-surfing commentary on the story were watching. It seems impossible that no filmmaker has thought to do this already but I cant think of one offhand. Good job Monsieur Besson. Like so many other movies this summer this is an international affair traveling from Taipei to Berlin to Paris. Egyptian actor Amr Waked even gets a second-banana role as a bewildered Parisian police captain. But Besson finds a way to make his obligatory superhero origin scenes feel fresh. In the funniest doctor visit in a movie since the xenomorph abortion in Prometheus Lucy corrals a surgeon at gunpoint and orders him to remove the leaking bag of superdope. While hes doing that she phones home. One of the drugs early effects is total recall of everything shes ever experienced. ""I can remember the taste of your milk"" she tells her bewildered mom. At least one person in the theater groaned in revulsion but I thought it was touching. The climax set in Paris crosscuts Lucys meetup with a roomful of the Worlds Most Brilliant Scientists with a gunbattle between the French police and the Taiwanese gangsters in the corridors outside. (Smuggling drugs through customs requires surgical rape but flying from Taipei to Paris with enough fully automatic weapons to storm the Bastille all over again aint no thing apparently.) Besson cuts the shootout in a way that conveys his diminished interest in it One insert shows a statue probably hundreds of years old losing its nose to a stray round. Always these morons and their guns its expression seems to say. Meanwhile at the grown-up table ScarJo holds court with the eggheads. ""Now that I have access to the furthest reaches of my brain I see things clearly"" she begins. It doesnt even sound clunky when she says it. Now that ladies and gentlemen is a movie star.

But it is true about most summer movies. Pouring their wizardry into special effects and well-choreographed fights warm-weather action films rarely challenge the viewer with grand notions or beautifully baffling imagery. Viewers who invest two hours in a superhero movie often leave feeling entertained but somehow dumber. Luc Bessons Lucy is here to the rescue. The French writer-director-producers new movie about a woman empowered and imperiled by the explosion of a powerful new drug in her nervous system kicks ass and takes brains. Besson creates a heroine whose rapidly expanding abilities make her the worlds most awesome weapon. In the process he promotes Scarlett Johansson from an indie-film icon and Marvel-universe sidekick to the movie superwoman she was destined to be. Taking place in less than a day -- and synopsizing 3 million years of human evolution in a hurtling 82 min. of screen time -- Lucy tops its only competition Tom Cruise and Doug Limans underappreciated Edge of Tomorrow as the summers coolest juiciest smartest action movie. (READ Corlisss review of Edge of Tomorrow) The cleverness in Bessons film isnt in its pseudoscience premise -- that Johanssons Lucy is transformed from a clueless American grad student to a genius and martial arts adept as her brain-use percentage skyrockets from 10% to 100%. No its in showing that from great power can come both genetic transformation and personal tragedy. While Marvel heroes live on in countless remakes and reboots Lucy may not survive the toxic drug that makes her unique. But it does give her a glimpse of the big cosmic picture. ""Life was given to us a billion years ago"" she says in a voice-over at the films beginning. ""What have we done with it?"" By the end shell show you. Rated R for its dollops of violence this female-glorifying picture not only shames all PG-13-rated summer spectacles for their wimpitude but also lures the audience into accompanying it on a third-act trip of ambitious movie madness. It begins with a vision of the first known hominid the 3 million-year-old female discovered in Ethiopia in 1974 and nicknamed Lucy then bombards you with allusive montages (say of various species copulating) and the intricate drizzle of computer algorithms and ultimately spirals into transcendent Kubrickian speculation all while satisfying the basic movie appetite for twists and thrills. (FIND 2001 A Space Odyssey on the updated all-TIME 100 Movies list) In Taipei Lucys scuzzy friend Richard (Pilou Asbaek) saddles her with a locked briefcase to be delivered to the mysterious Mr. Jang (Choi Min-sik the Korean star of Oldboy and I Saw the Devil). In a hotel lobby Richard is shot dead while five Asian heavyweights strong-arm Lucy up to Jangs corpse-littered suite. Rinsing the blood from a few recent murders off his hands Jang orders her to open the briefcase. It contains four packets of a blue powder called CPH4; it is as Jangs English-speaking aide (Julian Rhind-Tutt) notes ""a drug the kids in Europe are gonna enjoy."" Lucy is sedated and wakes up with an abdomen scar; her belly has been sliced open to contain one of the four packets. She and three other unfortunates will be muling the drug to European capitals spurring addiction death and chaos ... unless -- theres always an unless -- Lucy can harness her gigabyte brain waves in the few hours she is told she has left to live. (READ Did Oldboy inspire the Virginia Tech shootings?) A sadistic prison guards kick to Lucys stomach triggers the effects of the CPH4. With her brain power now at 20% (the rising numbers are flashed onscreen like intermittent basketball scores) she overpowers the guard kills him and takes his gun walks into the prison kitchen kills the four guys there steals one of their jackets to cover the blood stain on her shirt goes outside shoots a cabbie who doesnt quickly enough hop to her request for a ride takes another cab to the hospital where she strides into an operating room and to persuade the doctors of their need for speed in her case shoots the patient on the surgical table. (A quick scan of the patients X-rays tells her he wasnt going to live anyway.) All this which would be a long set piece in any other movie takes about 4 min. Besson is in as much of a hurry as Lucy is. In a Paris lecture hall Professor Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman) is spouting the 10% theory that full use of our mental capacity can allow the earths creatures ""to go from evolution to revolution."" (He must have just seen Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.) Norman also teaches that humans seek to continue the species either by reproduction or immortality. Lucy had the second option thrust upon her. Before flying to Paris for urgent consultation with Norman she visits Jang pinioning his hands to his chair arms with two knife blades and calmly explaining ""Learning is always a painful process."" It is for her on the plane from Taipei her cells start breaking up flying around her. The perfect machine shes become may be disintegrating. (READ The genius chimps in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) She spends the rest of the movie in Paris battling a couple dozen of Jangs thugs and trying to cope with or accept her potent poignant new condition. At first delighted by her burgeoning skills and acuity she soon realizes by Googling the available literature at supercomputer swiftness that she cant control her new power -- that ""all things human are fading away."" She could be Dr. Jekyll turned into a destructive nearly indestructible Mr. Hyde; or the scientist played by Jeff Goldblum in David Cronenbergs 1986 The Fly who tries to understand his unique metamorphosis even as he succumbs to it. Similarly superwoman Lucy wants to hold on to her humanity. In Paris she abruptly kisses the detective (Amr Waked) assigned to her. ""Whyd you do that?"" he asks and she replies ""A reminder"" -- of what human emotion feels like. (FIND The Fly on the all-TIME Top 25 Horror Movies list) Once in a while Lucy indulges in the inane conventions of summer action films. How is it that in Taipei Lucy can read Jangs mind (to discover the identities and itineraries of the drug mules sent to Berlin Rome and Paris) yet on a Paris street she doesnt notice that her nemesis is 10 feet away? Because its a movie And why when shes in a rush to meet the professor does she insist on driving the wrong way on a one-way highway? Because its a Luc Besson movie; most of the films hes produced including the Taxi Transporter and Taken franchises are full of car chases and crashes. Another of the Frenchmans fancies making action pictures about women. In La Femme Nikita Anne Parillaud is trained as an assassin. In The Professional 12-year-old Natalie Portman helped hit man Jean Reno fulfill a contract. The Fifth Element the filmmakers biggest Stateside hit paired taxi driver Bruce Willis with the galaxys most ideal specimen or speciwoman Milla Jovovich. He also directed biopics of historys favorite insurgent heroines Joan of Arc (The Messenger) and Aung San Suu Kyi (The Lady). Besson must figure that a gender comprising more than half the worlds human population deserves to be represented playing at least 10% of the lead characters in action films. Itd be fine with me if Hollywood followed Bessons lead and upped the ratio to Lucy level. (READ Michelle Yeoh plays Aung San Suu Kyi in Luc Bessons The Lady) In a role originally proposed to Angelina Jolie Johansson grows from grad-student tearfulness to appropriate a good deal of Jolies glowering majesty and to show all appropriate stages along the way. In the recent British film Under the Skin Johansson played an alien creature that soullessly seduces human males and harvests their meat. And in Spike Jonzes her she was the more-human-than-human voice of Joaquin Phoenixs operating system. Bessons film restores Johanssons humanity even as it may slip away from Lucy. The longest single shot is of a phone call Lucy makes from Taipei to her kindly concerned mother (Laura DArista) back in the States. Tears flow from the actresss right eye as if Lucy is being drained of all the emotion she has felt and will ever feel and is weeping for the loss. (READ Corliss on Scarlett Johansson in Under the Skin) But dont weep for Lucy. Just keep track of her strange attributes the sprouting of extra hands and gooey tentacles. Wonder at her lightning travels across space (she stands in Times Square as humanity zooms around her at a Koyaanisqatsi tempo) and time (when the oldest Lucy and the newest touch fingers in a Sistine Chapel-ceiling moment). And be appreciative that toward the end of a summer with a lot of meh action epics one film has shown how the genre can accommodate a crazy-great movie. Thank you Scarlett Luc and Lucy.

Working from the (disputed) premise that we humans have access to only 3 to 5 percent of our brains Besson tells the story of a young American (Scarlett Johansson) in Taipei whoas accidentally dosed with a mind-expanding drug and as hitherto unused gray cells are activated becomes more and more omnipotent a super super-duper and then super-duper-puper-uper-uper. To help us keep track of how much of her own brain sheas acolonizinga Besson puts the percentage in big bold letters on the screen and he regularly cuts to a speculative lecture by a neuroscientist (Morgan Freeman) from whom we learn that more cells donat just mean deeper thoughts. With as little as 20 percent of your brain he intones you can control other things other people and eventually all matter. At 100 percent the skyas the limit. Like literally. How does Lucy become a brainiac? Not a long story -- nothing takes too long in Lucy which Besson brings in at a trim 88 minutes. A sleazy boyfriend gets her mixed up with Taipei gangsters who turn her into a drug mule sewing a big bag of something purple called CPH4 into her stomach. Its inevitable rupture triggers a lot of excellent inside-the-brain whooshy special-effects but Bessons focus is as much evolutionary as neurochemical. Lucys brain is in some thrillingly dopey way moving backwards in time First shes accessing memories of her own childhood and birth (in explosive free-for-all montages); and then shes going even further back to the dawn of our species the dawn of all species the dawn of stuff however you want to define stuff.A Johansson plays Lucy as a mouthy hanger-on whos transformed into a ninja Carrie White in The Matrix. Chinese assassins move fast but she moves faster. Shes not I should point out a vigilante avenger. Shes beyond human emotion. Its true that someone accessing say 50 percent of her brain probably has more cerebral things to do with her time. But in a way this is cerebral. She throws one glance at the advancing hordes and its a bloody Busby Berkeley ballet of flying bodies. Related Stories See 16 Years of Scarlett Johanssonas Red-Carpet Looks Besson wouldnt come up with an idea like this if he didnt want to test himself -- to leave the relatively realistic fisticuffs of Taken for the far-out reaches of The Fifth Element and beyond. There are so many more variables for a fight scene when your heroine is in tune with the vibrations of sound the molecules in the air and the very rotation of the Earth. When Lucy gets behind the wheel the world eats her dust. Her skin turns different colors. She takes over TV and radio waves. Johansson meanwhile leaves behind Black Widow and Samantha the Her cybergoddess. She becomes one with the universe of action movies. There arent really any characters per se in Lucy but I was grooving on it until the final scene when Freeman gets Johansson into his laboratory and things get a mite abstract. Its hard to get too upset with Besson for not knowing how to end the movie though. Hes a very smart man but by the time Lucy hits the 90th brain percentile shes out of the realm of any human screenwriter. Terence Malick could conceivably have been drafted to take a whack at Lucys final minutes which bear some resemblance to The Tree of Life as well as 2001. But perhaps its better open-ended. As our descendants evolve colonize more of their own brains and approach the man-machine singularity filmmakers can continue to add onto Lucy and then some critic can add on to the end of this review because well never evolve beyond movie criticism. This post has corrected to show that the film takes place in Taipei not Hong Kong.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 25 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jul. 24 2014 534PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Luc Besson Written by Luc Besson Starring Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman Classification 14A Country USA Language English If the last year in movies has taught us anything its that Scarlett Johansson is sensational at playing non-humans. After starring using only her voice as Joaquin Phoenixs sexy cellphone lover in Her and as a man-eating alien without a conscience in Jonathan Glazers Under the Skin she now brings it all together in Luc Bessons ridiculous incoherent but pretty entertaining Lucy as a hard-partying young American exchange student in Taiwan who thanks to a drug overdose becomes God. Or what He would be like if He were a hot chick on drugs with a gun. After Lucy unwillingly gets a kilo of illegal smart drug surgically implanted in her gut by Chinese gangsters the bag accidentally bursts open. Instead of killing her it allows her to use 100 per cent of her brain power rather than the 10 per cent we mortals supposedly employ.The belief is inaccurate but whos counting? To really enjoy Lucy the latest logic-free thriller from Besson the French maestro of mayhem you should probably use only one or two per cent of your brain the parts that enjoy flashing lights loud noises and the animal-attack videos that keep popping up during the movie.Lucy begins with brief noble nod to Stanley Kubricks 2001 and its dawn-of-humanity scene before we jump to contemporary Taipei where Lucy instead of studying has been hanging with a sleazy Danish dude (Pilou Asbaek) who turns out to be a low-level drug runner. Consequently Lucy gets captured by Korean gangsters led by Mr. Jang (the great wearily malevolent Choi Min-Sik of Oldboy fame). The gang with a snooty English accomplice plans to smuggle bags of the drug a synthetic form of a pregnancy hormone called CPH4 in the stomachs of several unwilling European travellers and are sending them back home under duress to make the deliveries.The diabolical Korean criminals are apparently determined to make Europeans slightly smarter whether they want it or not.When Lucys bag breaks thanks to a kick in the stomach from a bad guy she is able to access progressively more of her smart parts with her improvement shown onscreen in roughly 10-minute intervals 20 per cent 30 per cent and so on. Fortunately we know exactly what this development means because the progress of her cranial development is cross-cut with a lecture on exactly that subject by the Paris-based scientist Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman).So whats it like to be so smart? First Lucy becomes an expert killer who can take out entire gangs of thugs with pinpoint shots. She can endure surgery without an anesthetic learn languages instantly and absorb thousands of pages of information at a glance. By the time she gets closer to 100 per cent its as though she is watching all the YouTube videos youve ever seen running really quickly on two laptops at the same time. Also she can suspend gravity travel in time to the Old West or the age of the dinosaurs and compel an airline attendant to bring champagne even when the plane is just about to land.Omnipotence rocks though theres a catch. As Lucys body and mind are rapidly evolving her individual cells want to fall off on their own - bits of her start flying away in the airplane washroom - and she knows she has about 24 hours to stay alive which makes this one of those time-ticking movies like Crank or Speed. Twelve of those precious hours are devoted to flying from Taipei to Paris where Professor Norman lives and where the other drug mules are converging.Along with Professor Norman and his genius scientist friends (you can tell theyre in the genius club because they all wear the same white lab coat) Lucy teams up with a cynical French policeman (Egyptian actor Amr Waked) to bring down her enemies. And to pass on her wisdom for the future benefit of the human race on a handy USB key. At one point when the cop asks the apparently invincible Lucy what she could possibly need him for she gives him a big kiss. ""To remind me"" she says thinking of her randy careless youth which took place earlier that day.Lucy you may have twigged is named after our 3.2-million-year-old hominid ancestor.She might also be seen as a stand in for Luc (as in Besson) and the movie shows indications of being his grand statement on life the cosmos and whatever. At times Lucy the movie veers precariously close to the New Age preciousness of such films as Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life or Darren Aronofskys The Fountain. Between shooting sprees and high-speed car chases the character of Lucy occasionally ponders the relationship between time and mathematics evolution and emotions while Besson illustrates with footage of wild animals dividing cells atomic bombs and time-lapse traffic.Given what shes working with Johansson does an amazing job of providing a centre to all these fevered montages and half-cooked ideas. She does more real acting in the early scenes - with her frightened tears and her punk resistance to the gangster. Later when she becomes a brainiac she gets more physical swagger but behaves more like a robot speaking in affectless monotone while moving with high-speed efficiency.Throughout though Johannson has moments when she slips around the facade with a smirk or a melting gaze that keep this shiny silly film feeling comic and human. Its a funny thing how smart and stupid often seem so similarly mechanical in movies but thanks to Johanssons performance we have a fizzy cocktail of a film that blends both ingredients.

Lucy Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2014) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lucy-2014,200,lucy12,lucy,rogerebert
"Lucy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lucy ) Lucy (France 2014) July 24 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Expectations for Lucy based on television commercials and theatrical trailers will result in a skewed and inaccurate representation of the film. This is not as the marketing department of Universal Pictures would have one believe a kick-ass superhero film. This isnt Scarlett Johanssons response to Marvels (thus-far) reluctance to give Black Widow a stand-alone film. In fact in tone and intent this is closer to Johanssons Under the Skin than it is The Avengers. The action scenes depicted in the Lucy advertisements are in the movie but the context differs. Luc Bessons production is a sci-fi yarn that ponders the meaning of time and the importance of evolution while occasionally throwing in some shootouts. And although the titular heroine develops superpowers the most interesting thing about them is how they expand and where the journey ultimately takes her. And since shes terminally ill her mission isnt killing bad guys but finding a way to pass on the massive amounts of knowledge she has acquired to those who will come after her. Lucy is what a superhero movie might look like if developed by Spike Jonze and/or Michael Gondry. On the surface Lucys premise sounds plausible enough even though its based on a debunked urban legend. The idea goes something like this human beings typically utilize only about 10% of their cerebral capacity (not true) so what would happen if a person could open up all the unused neural pathways and access 100%? The movie goes on some flights of fancy in following this to its improbable conclusion but although one might deem Bessons resolution to be preposterous its never uninteresting. Although the movie eventually transforms into something odd it begins in a traditional Besson-ish fashion which is to say with fast cuts violence and warped humor. Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is in the wrong place at the wrong time. She is tricked by her soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend into delivering a locked briefcase to a gangster Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) who is not sympathetic to Lucys predicament. After forcing her to open the briefcase which contains a new kind of experimental drug Mr. Jang takes Lucy prisoner inserts a bag of the drug into her stomach and forces her to work as his mule. However rough treatment at the hands of one of Mr. Jangs thugs causes the bag to break and the drug leaks into Lucys system. There are two consequences to this her brain capacity begins to increase and she becomes terminally ill. She seeks out brain expert Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) who spends much of the movie in exposition mode in an attempt to understand whats happening to her. Meanwhile Mr. Jang and his men track Lucy with the goal of killing her before she becomes too powerful to take out. The plot element involving the bad guys in Lucy feels almost irrelevant. Mr. Jang isnt threatening and Besson doesnt take the time to make him into anything more sinister than a cartoon character. Once Lucy has begun to evolve theres no sense that shes in danger. Lucy is more about her journey - what shes becoming and what its implications are for humanity. Besson doesnt provide all the answers. The ending is saturated with ambiguity. Scarlett Johanssons presence combined with the way in which the movie concludes brings a forceful echo of Her. Some viewers left that movie scratching their heads. That will be even truer of Lucy. Universal has done this movie a disservice by positioning it as a mainstream action/thriller and hinting that Lucy is an X-Men style mutant who will use her powers to do all sorts of crowd-pleasing things. Instead this is closer to an art house film than a mainstream offering and the hue and cry from those expecting the summers next big blockbuster will be loud indeed. Sure theres plenty of action in Lucy but its not of the rah-rah sort. This is a more contemplative sort of motion picture. The climax in particular although as visually impressive as it is bizarre (Tree of Life anyone?) is more likely to frustrate than satisfy. This defiance of expectations done with bold-faced irreverence allows Lucy to work on its own terms. There are plenty of plot-related issues not the least of which is that the films ""science"" is wrongheaded in many ways but its hard not to be impressed by a movie that pushes forward relentlessly without being predictable. I value films even flawed ones that have the capacity to surprise me. Audiences in general will probably react negatively to Lucy but thats more the fault of the promoters and marketers than it is of the men and women who crafted it. This is a fine quirky sci-fi offering that will appeal to those who arent in the theater for the reasons most people will be.

The second third feels a bit like ""The Professional."" The ending is maybe ""Videodrome"" meets the final 15 minutes of ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" Wait. Youre looking at me like this is a bad thing? True maybe for some movie fans - those who think Scarlett Johansson plus director Luc Besson should simply equal an hour-and-a-half of a Hollywood siren kicking guys in the face -- ""Lucy"" will disappoint. But for Besson devotees who sat stoically through ""The Lady"" (or patiently during that endless ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" series) ""Lucy"" is a trippy return to form -- to mind-twisting stories to rocket-propelled camerawork to eyes-wide-open dreams. Its the cinema of instant gratification with every thought or mood turned into an image. Johansson sees suspicious men approaching? We cut to stalking predators on the savannah. Psychic powers are discussed? Time for a clip of Vincent Price in ""The Mad Magician."" The styles a bit jarring at first but soon you realize its form following content -- because this is a movie about thoughts made real where the naked power of your mind can truly influence other people move matter even conquer time. The real joke of ""Lucy"" is that the gift the movie bestows -- being able to use every bit of your potential -- it gives to a woman barely using her brain at all. Slightly trashy very vague Johanssons Lucy is a party girl now stranded in Taiwan with no prospects and one shady boyfriend. Who tricks her into delivering a suspicious package to a paranoid drug smuggler -- who then quickly decides to use her as a mule to smuggle the contents of that package into Europe. The problem is that the contents are a synthetic mind-altering drug. The way they want her to smuggle it is internally. And when that package accidentally breaks inside her Johansson transforms into the kind of super-brilliant superhuman killing machine who could send Black Widow running back home to her dolls. An experimental drug gives Johansson new ways of seeing in LucyUNIVERSAL What follows for awhile is a bloody thriller that may remind viewers of ""Oldboy"" (particularly since Choi Min-suk of that movie plays the chief villain here). There are those visual exclamation points of course and regular cross-cuts to scientist Morgan Freeman helping explain stuff but mostly this feels like a modern action movie. But then the drug really starts changing Lucy -- and the movie starts changing along with her. Her body begins to transform (sometimes in truly inexplicable ways). Her emotions drop away. (Sadly theyre seen as incompatible with a higher-functioning intelligence.) She starts getting control over physical laws like gravity and even time. Which I admit was where the movie began to lose me. Tell me that a superintellect could move objects I might be willing to suspend disbelief; tell me that she could transform her body or travel into the past -- this is ""X-Men"" territory and suddenly introduced into a 90-minute movie a little hard to go with. But Besson bless him wants to go even further -- and pushes the plot past even this into an ultimate-trip ending that mixes Cronenberg ""new flesh"" imagery with Kubrickian all-white interiors to come up with a literally cosmic climax. Which is why I can imagine guys expecting another ""Femme Nikita"" leaving this a little disappointed. Yet although I was occasionally confused -- or annoyed -- let down is one thing I never felt here. Johansson (who with this ""Her"" and ""Under the Skin"" has shown a real affinity for philosophical sci-fi) is an interesting albeit distant presence; adding humanity is Egypts wry Amr Waked (whom Besson with his usual inclusiveness casts as a French police officer). And although the final 10 minutes or so moves beyond concrete reality to take a somewhat muddled ""ultimate trip"" -- complete with man/ape but minus Kubricks real vision -- ""Lucy"" has at least one thing in common with its heroine and a few other of the summers more outside-the-box sci-fi movies It uses all of its intelligence. Ratings note The film contains violence substance abuse strong language sexual situations and violence. Lucy (R) Universal (90 min.) Directed by Luc Besson. With Scarlett Johansson Morgan Freeman.

"Lucy a brainy thriller with a dumb premise review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLucy a brainy thriller with a dumb premise review Lucy by French filmmaker Luc Besson stars Scarlett Johansson as a woman who acquires incredible brain power after an encounter with gangsters in Taiwan.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. July 24 2014LucyStarring Scarlett Johansson Morgan Freeman Min-sik Choi. Written and directed by Luc Besson. Opens Friday at major theatres. 90 minutes. 14ASpoiler alert the popularly held belief that human beings use only 10 per cent of their brains -- a factoid critical to the plot of Lucy -- is complete and utter hokum.The latest action thriller from French writer/director Luc Besson nonetheless takes this simple (but erroneous) concept and runs with it using the gravitas of actor Morgan Freeman playing eminent Professor Norman to posit the possibilities of what might happen if a person were able to use much much more of their grey matter.Article Continued BelowThe person in question is hapless Lucy who finds herself in Taipei Taiwan dating a shady dirt bag named Richard who cons her into delivering a briefcase to a ruthless crime lord named Mr. Jang.Scarlett Johansson plays a helpless victim who soon becomes a single-minded super-genius thanks to a mysterious drug in Lucy.  (Universal)  How ruthless is Mr. Jang? After his thugs drag Lucy upstairs Mr. Jang emerges from a nearby room covered in blood and uses bottled water to wash his hands. Lucy soon finds herself in deep trouble part of a quartet of mules who unwillingly have packages of weird blue crystals -- possibly a growth hormone -- implanted in their guts for export to foreign climes mostly in Europe.Worse still for our heroine Lucy finds herself chained to a wall and menaced by another baddie who after his advances are rebuffed kicks her hard enough to break the bag and unleash the contents into her unsuspecting circulatory system.Things begin to change rapidly as Lucys heretofore semi-limited brain power starts to soar dramatically. Before you know it Lucy is reaching a new level of self-awareness -- including a clear memory of the taste of her mothers breast milk -- followed in short order by an ability to toss things around telekinesis-style.""I feel everything"" Lucy tells her mom during a long-distance phone call. Including the rotation of the Earth.Scarlett Johansson plays the central role of Lucy in two parts first as a teary-eyed ingenue who finds herself the victim of events beyond her control before she morphs into a clear-eyed super-genius rapidly discarding all vestiges of her humanity.In her own way Lucy eventually becomes as ruthless and single-minded as the nefarious Mr. Jang. Its a deftly textured performance by the exceedingly versatile Johansson especially the subtle moments when she realizes her former identity is slipping away.With his sonorous voice Freeman effortlessly delivers his usual steady-handed performance as the professor and Min-sik Choi is a pleasingly nasty villain. Amr Waked projects an easy Gallic sensuality as French police detective Pierre Del Rio Lucys unexpected accomplice.Besson a tremendously successful filmmaker with a long string of action-packed hits as director or writer including Nikita (1990) The Fifth Element (1997) and the Transporter and Taken series delivers his latest with his trademark idiosyncratic flair. At a mere 90 minutes the film zips along at a breathless pace and the action sequences are delivered with Bessons usual aplomb. He also injects a playful streak of humour at various points to break the tension.But its in the films final throes that Besson lets his audience down badly delivering a conclusion that falls flat feeling both anti-climactic and unsatisfactory.Bessons script deals with big ideas from the nature of intelligence to the origins of humankind and the cosmos itself. (Lucy were reminded is the oldest humanoid fossil ever discovered). No one onscreen has the answers to the lofty questions Besson poses and despite all the dizzying and splendid imagery of the films closing frames its patently clear that neither does he.

Release DateJuly 25 2014 Full Review Trailer http//www.lucymovie.com/ Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - By Amy Nicholson Scarlett Johansson has always seemed more human than human her round lips and hips signaling something primordial to us cavemen huddled in the dark of the movie theater. How odd then that her last three films have reduced her to a robotic destroyer of men as an operating system in Her a man-eating alien in Under the Skin and now Lucy in which an overdose of CPH4 -- the chemical that develops embryos in the womb -- turns her into a blank-eyed assassin with 100 percent mental control over her brain as opposed to the 10 percent that merely allows us mortals to solve Rubiks Cubes and blast astronauts into space. Director Luc Besson must think the audience is operating with even fewer synapses. Here his style is slick but hand-holdingly literal. In the opening when Lucys boyfriend-of-the-week (Pilou Asbaek) forces her to deliver a briefcase to a Taiwanese gangster (Min-sik Choi) Besson edits in a shot of a mouse in a trap. When that gangster sews drugs in her stomach he splices in a cheetah snapping the neck of a gazelle. Later as the newly bionic Lucy seeks vengeance Besson even tries to convince us shes a strong female character which to the majority of male action directors simply means a sexy silent badass. The real females in the audience may wonder why a genius would limp across a multi-continental gunfight in five-inch Louboutins. (Hey smarty-pants wear sneakers.) Theres enough mumbo jumbo about space and time and cellular division to allow Lucy to feign depth but what lingers is Bessons regressive belief that even the most intelligent woman on earth cant figure out how to get her way without a miniskirt and a gun.

Hell I wanted to see it myself and Im glad I did although it seems likely that the net effect of Luc Bessons ""Lucy"" is the opposite of the designer drugs that Johanssons character accidentally ingests in the movie. These super-duper bionic cocaine crystals in a pleasing shade of electric blue open up previously unexplored areas of your brain and turn you into a godlike superintelligence at least if youre a hard-partying American college student in Taipei. ""Lucy"" on the other hand will make you dumber than you were already.I could have used some cocaine or coffee or Evian water or any damn thing to get through the nonsensical portions of Bessons screenplay when Morgan Freeman playing an Important Brain Scientist delivers a lecture to a lot of earnest-looking Europeans who nod along with all the gobbledygook he spouts. Its like a parody of movie-script bad science in which irrelevant slides about cellular division and evolution cycle behind Freemans head while he talks about dolphins and echolocation and how if we could use more of our cerebral capacity we could control our own bodies and then other peoples bodies and then toasters and telephones and finally time and the cosmos. We know all that stuff Professor Exposition When is the hot chick with the drugs sewn into her belly just above the lacy underwear gonna start killing people? As a friend observed ""Lucy"" completes the 2014 trilogy of dead-eyed Johansson action flicks after ""Under the Skin"" and ""Captain America The Winter Soldier.""Fortunately the interludes between action scenes are not long in ""Lucy"" and soon enough we are watching Johanssons eponymous character acid-wired into the info-core of the universe demonstrating her supremacy by sticking French cops to the floor and Korean gangsters to the ceiling. Whatever you want to say about Bessons brand of cinema - for example that he mashes up his favorite kinds of American and Asian gangster flicks throws in a few rugged-looking Euro guys with shaved heads and speeds up the tempo - he understands the virtue of forward momentum. ""Lucy"" may be ridiculous and may revel in that ridiculousness; its a movie about a gun-toting bottle-blond drug mule on a mission of vengeance which also features a time-travel sequence to 19th-century Manhattan (and before that to pre-Columbian America with natives incongruously riding horses) a vision of our planets coming destruction and at least two appearances by that other Lucy the purported simian ancestress of us all. Hell it also has rhinos and pigs having sex (although not with each other) footage of volcanoes and typhoons and other forces of natural chaos and an animated journey through the pain-overloaded neurons of a Korean drug lords brain. Does it make sense? Not at all. Is it boring? Not that either. You Might Also Like Im not kidding about the ""2001"" references which run through the movie so obsessively from beginning to end that Im afraid Besson takes them seriously. I guess you could say there are ""Tree of Life"" references too - we get the dinosaurs but not the lyrical Texas DDT haze - but thats arguably just ""2001"" delivered by other means. (Whichever Twitter wag has described ""Lucy"" as the prequel to Spike Jonzes ""Her"" in which Johansson plays an operating system Thats genius.) How much do you really need to know about the plot? Every Besson movie has pretty much the same plot which in any case is just a delivery system for bright colors a restrained and almost puritanical version of sexuality (we see Lucy in her rather prim undies) elaborate shootouts and motor-vehicle choreography. Lucy ends up handcuffed to a briefcase full of the aforementioned designer drugs and in the possession of Mr. Jang (Choi Min-sik of ""Oldboy"" and the 2013 Korean hit ""New World"") the sort of Asian crime lord whose movie destiny is to inflict and endure great pain. As for Johansson I know what Im about to say is a truism but its true Shes no better than adequate in the early scenes when Lucy is super-scared and weepy all the time. Once the pouch of superdrugs has been sewed into her belly and then accidentally burst Lucy no longer feels fear or pain or desire and ScarJos in her comfort zone. There are a number of terrific production numbers in ""Lucy"" basically violent action scenes that border on slapstick and as long as we agree in advance that the ""science"" in this movie goes beyond pseudo into total B.S. I believe you will leave satisfied. I think my favorite is the scene when Super Lucy tracks down Freemans character in his Paris hotel room and comes at him through all media Howard Stern-style The room phone his smart phone the TV the computer the clock radio. Apparently the result of her profound insight into the nature of time and existence is to not give a crap about anybody or anything; she inflicts widespread civilian casualties amid the open-air markets of Paris and the Taiwanese healthcare system. She makes out briefly with a hot Parisian cop (Egyptian-born French actor Amr Waked) as a sort of dim reminder of the existence of sex and then its off to drive knives through peoples hands and observe the beginning and end of all things.

Universal Pictures AP AP AP Lucy    Director Luc Besson Cast Scarlett Johansson Morgan Freeman Rated R (strong violence disturbing images sexuality) Running time 89 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 404pm on Thursday Jul. 24 2014 Thursday Jul. 24 2014 Thursday Jul. 24 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Whats with Scarlett Johansson playing all these women who are not quite of our reality? In Her she was like a Super Siri the hyper-intelligent voice of the next generation of computing. In Under the Skin she was an extraterrestrial on the prowl for men. And of course shes the bringer of beatdowns as the Black Widow in The Avengers.Now shes the first human to tap into 100 percent of her brain power in Lucy. From French director Luc Besson this goofily enjoyable but ultimately forgettable techno-thriller plays like a cross between Transcendence and La Femme Nikita with a little bit of Hong Kong-style action and low-rent 2001-era Stanley Kubrick thrown in for good measure.Johansson is Lucy an American living the party life in Taiwan though its never explained what brought her there. Richard (Pilou Asbaek) a casual boyfriend she has known for only a few days is trying to convince her to do his job deliver a briefcase to the mysterious Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) at a luxury hotel. Hell even give her half the 1000 payment hes getting from Jang.After Richard forces her to take the case she realizes shes in deep trouble. It turns out that whats inside is a powerful new party drug that Jangs sharply dressed and cutthroat crew of gangsters wants to market across Europe. To get it all there safely theyve surgically inserted packets of the stuff into drugged and kidnapped tourists.But Lucys bag ruptures after being kicked by one of Jangs minions sending a flood of the drug into her system. Instead of killing her it turns her into the smartest person on the planet -- and the best fighter of course.As it just so happens Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) is a world-renowned scientist working in Paris on the powers of the brain. Lucy who feels that her rapidly escalating intelligence means she wont be of this physical realm much longer wants to get to him and download what she knows to help mankind. Meanwhile Jang and his gang have far less lofty goals. They just want their drugs back.It all leads to a well-staged auto chase through the streets of Paris and an impressive sequence where Lucy observes the history of Manhattan and mankind in reverse. (You dont need a Ph.D. in anthropology to make the connection between our Lucy and the hominid called Lucy humankinds ultimate ancestor. And the movie makes that point about a hundred times.)Besson keeps things light and breezy (the movie clocks in at just under 90 minutes) and Johansson is relatable even in the midst of utter nonsense. The scene where she calls her mom from a Taiwanese hospital may be better than this movie deserves.It reminds audiences that while Johansson may have a knack for taking on the otherworldly shes still at her best when shes at her most human.

Photo Credit Jessica Forde advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT After ingesting a strange drug a young woman develops superpowers. Rated R (strong violence disturbing images and sexuality) BOTTOM LINE Johansson has fun in her latest sci-fi role but the action gets lost amid the pseudoscience. CAST Scarlett Johansson Morgan Freeman Choi Min-sik LENGTH 128 ""Kill Bill"" meets ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" in Luc Bessons fascinating disaster ""Lucy"" the story of a woman who develops cosmic superpowers after absorbing a strange drug. Though ostensibly a simple revenge thriller in which Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) hunts down the thugs who implanted her with the creepy chemical CPH4 the movie has more on its mind -- including but not limited to the nature of time the definition of consciousness and the evolution of mankind. Its rare to see female action heroes onscreen (let alone one who merges with the universe) but Besson is a connoisseur. Hes worked with several sultry muses over the years from Anne Parillaud in 1990s ""Nikita"" to Zoe Saldana in 2011s ""Colombiana."" Johansson though is a star of different magnitude and shes begun specializing in supra-human roles the gravity-defying Black Widow in ""The Avengers"" a computer-being in ""Her"" a hyper-evolved alien in ""Under the Skin."" The otherworldly actress and the flashy trashy director seem like a match made in sci-fi heaven. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Lucy"" begins promisingly with Johansson in fine form as a terrified victim and Besson trying out an unexpectedly funny almost Dadaist visual style. As Lucys boyfriend lures her into the drug-mule business Besson cuts to a mouse sniffing a trap; as thugs circle around her leopards stalk gazelles. (Besson is the films editor as well as writer- director.) When Morgan Freemans Professor Norman begins lecturing on human brain capacity -- Lucy is rapidly approaching 100 percent -- the movie chops up so many images that it looks like an educational film gone berserk. At first its dazzling. Besson forgets however that hes promised us pulp entertainment and instead delivers a serious treatise on next-step metaphysics. As Lucy evolves into an all-knowing all-powerful force the humans around her become useless. In the end ""Lucy"" is gobbledygook. Like the recent Johnny Depp vehicle ""Transcendence"" it conflates the mythical with the mundane science with magic God with the Internet. At least this 88-minute movie wont take up too much of your brain capacity. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT After ingesting a strange drug a young woman develops superpowers.

Starring Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Luc Besson. (R. 90 minutes.) Like some demented combination of ""Taken"" and Terrence Malicks ""The Tree of Life"" ""Lucy"" the latest from Luc Besson is a full-out action movie - and a sober rumination on the nature of existence. It is both things effectively and sincerely. Like ""Taken"" which Besson wrote it has a streamlined story involving international crime and presents a previously mild-mannered protagonist on a homicidal rampage. And like ""The Tree of Life"" it is bright and opulent with lots of impressionist visuals vigorous cutting and even a cameo by a gratuitous dinosaur. The result is crazy but in the best way. ""Lucy"" hangs together not only through sheer velocity but from the unmistakable sense that this is no cynical product. Its an honest expression of the filmmakers mind - his prurience his paranoia his grandiosity and his aspiration. Besson is one of those lucky artists whose genuine impulses are fantastically commercial. No time is wasted. In the movies first moments Scarlett Johansson as Lucy is forced by her new boyfriend to deliver a locked suitcase to ""Mr. Jang"" at a posh Taipei hotel. On the off chance this sounds like a good idea Besson intercuts this with scenes of fawns being stalked by jungle cats. He further amps up the tension by having the hotel clerk get jittery at the mere mention of ""Mr. Jang."" And then we meet Jang (Min-Sik Choi) a cool customer whose face is splattered with blood. Leave it to Besson to include the little details that elude other filmmakers. When Jang sits down to question Lucy - first stepping over a dead body - the cuffs of his white shirt are wet and pink a mix of water and his victims blood. Ive been watching gangster movies all my life and never once had to ponder where mob bosses get their shirts cleaned. Clearly Lucy who is stupid to begin with and then stupid and terrified is in way over her head. The science fiction aspect of ""Lucy"" involves a brand-new illicit drug about to hit the international market. Through circumstances best discovered in the moment some of that drug starts seeping into Lucys system resulting in a profound expansion of her abilities. At first shes walking up the walls and onto the ceiling like Fred Astaire in ""Royal Wedding"" but soon she becomes focused. When she does she finds that she is not merely intelligent. She is a lethal genius. Skillfully Besson explains Lucys transformation by cutting back and forth from Lucy to a professor (Morgan Freeman) lecturing on the minds potential. Apparently human beings use only 10 percent of their cerebral capacity. Through the drug Lucy is using more and more of her brain and taking on undreamed-of powers - heightened senses telekinesis mind control. Besson invests ""Lucy"" with loving energy simulating Lucys perceptions and illustrating key points with brief cuts to the jungle to urban scenes arts performances windmills the Louvre Rubiks Cube. We see the life force in trees the waves and auras coming out of people and a survey of New York Citys topography from 2014 all the way back to prehistory. You can scoff at Bessons philosophies and hypotheses but to do that would miss whats in front of you. ""Lucy"" is an impeccably realized vision of Bessons view of things. Thats the vision he was responsible to and thats what he offers the viewer. For Johansson this is the second film in a row (after ""Under the Skin"") in which she plays a person of otherworldly intelligence floating along in a daze of doe-eyed equanimity as she passes harsh judgment on her inferiors. Its hard to imagine there will be many more roles like this but it has made for an interesting 2014. Johansson deserves some kind of credit for somehow not looking ridiculous. As for Besson he deserves acknowledgment as a French filmmaker who knows how to make American-style high-concept action movies better than most of his American counterparts. He never slows down never falls in love with sequences at the expense of story keeps his running times down and always remembers that its all about emotion. Besson also has the distinction of being the only European filmmaker who takes as much pleasure in regularly demolishing his own hometown (Paris) as American filmmakers do in taking a wrecking ball to New York and San Francisco. In ""Lucy"" Paris gets another serious work-over. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Lucy"" starring Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman saying that having a limitless protagonist results in limited payoff for moviegoer. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Lucy"" starring Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman saying that having a limitless protagonist results in limited payoff for moviegoer. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Le schlockmeister Luc Besson has no beef with men and guns or he wouldnt have made the ""Transporter"" movies with Jason Statham. Or written ""Taken."" But in the world according to Besson older girls (""La Femme Nikita"") and young women in wee skirts and stiletto heels gliding in slow motion toward their latest deserving victims of firearm violence carrying nicely polished automatic weapons in each perfectly manicured hand -- thats the stuff thats what makes Besson Besson.His latest is ""Lucy."" It stars Scarlett Johansson and for about 20 minutes its one of writer-director Bessons most efficient and enjoyable trash compactors. In Taipei Taiwan a hard-partying 25-year-old American studying abroad has just hooked up with a new boyfriend a man so sweaty and with such bad taste in clothes you know hell die early in the film. Hes a delivery boy for a Taiwanese gangster and drug lord (Choi Min-sik) and Johanssons Lucy is forced in handcuffs to deliver a briefcase to Mr. Jangs hotel room.All goes poorly. The briefcase contains a valuable and dangerous synthetic superdrug. The criminals slit open the abdomens of Lucy and three other unlucky folks so that large packets of the drug can be hidden inside and then used later to service all the eager young idiots in Europe looking for the next high. The drug is a brain-capacity enlarger allowing the user to exploit more than the usual 10 percent. The substance makes you insanely capable but a tad rabid. After one of Lucys captors kicks her in the stomach her bloodstream is suddenly flooded with the stuff. She becomes a kind of superwoman. With the aid of a bullet-headed Paris cop (Amr Waked) she must locate the other drug mules and exact revenge on Jang all the while ingesting more and more of the blue drug in what might be her final 24 hours on the planet.I mean whatever. Itll do for a grandiose action premise. But after a swift absurd sleekly mounted opening ""Lucy"" runs into a wall just as its superheroine is established as capable of limitless accomplishments.When you have a protagonist who can see through concrete overhear conversations miles away time-travel levitate her adversaries read minds and feel gravity for starters where does a movie go from there? Lucy even communes (briefly) with dinosaurs and tells her mother tearfully that she remembers when she was a breast-fed infant. A kindly brain expert (Morgan Freeman giving neurological exposition his very best shot) enlisted by Lucy cannot believe what hes seeing.Neither can we for different reasons. When everything and anything is possible nothing feels urgent or truly dramatic. The movie devolves into a melange of digital effects and sequences of glamorous slaughter as Lucy swaggers around with that big brain and slouches toward becoming a full-lipped deity. For much of the actresss fan base Johansson has been just that for years. Shes quite good in ""Lucy"" working both sides of the street plausibly terrified victim in one section unfeeling bad-ass the next. But before long it doesnt matter much which isnt how star vehicles are supposed to operate.mjphillipstribune.com""Lucy"" - 2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violence disturbing images and sexuality)Running time 129Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Reviews Scarlett Johansson Morgan Freeman Jason Statham Latest movie reviews Review Magic in the Moonlight  1/2 Review A Most Wanted Man  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising73deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-lucy-movie-review-20140724,0,859034.column",200,lucy23,lucy,chicagotribune

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 412 p.m. MST July 24 2014Luc Besson has a blast directing Scarlett Johansson as a woman whose brain power increases dramatically as she is pursued by relentless mobsters. Its ridiculous and great fun.Scarlett Johansson in a scene from ""Lucy.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 4 starsJohansson plays along with ease as Lucy gains intelligence and loses emotion.Johansson plays along with ease as Lucy gains intelligence and loses emotion.The films saving grace is Bessons sense of humor.""Lucy"" is insane makes very little sense doesnt stand up to scrutiny and is an absolute blast.Really if you like having fun at the movies and pretending to be smart while doing so you ought to see it. It doesnt matter how silly it all seems later.Writer and director Luc Besson decided to take off all the filters remove all the restraints and just go full-bore crazy both visually and with the story. Scarlett Johansson proves a willing accomplice by playing things straight the calm in the middle of a raging storm.She plays the title character a student living in Taiwan. Her boyfriend (Pilou Asbaek) dupes her into delivering a briefcase to a Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) a mysterious mobster type. This does not go well. The briefcase contains a drug in packages that Jangs henchmen implant in the abdomens of Lucy and others; they are mules with no choice in the matter.But Lucys packet is punctured. The drug begins leaking into her body which absorbs it causing her brain to work at an increasingly high level.Besson shifts back and forth between all this to Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman) a professor in Paris giving a lecture about how humans use only 10 percent of their brains. He speculates on what might happen if we were able to use more.AZCENTRALScarlett Johanssons 5 most essential filmsCut back to Lucy with an on-screen graphic showing the rising capacity of her brain function as she escapes her captors.The effect of the drug is not just Lucys increased intelligence but an ability to control other people as well as everything around her. She contacts Norman and rushes to meet him to try to figure out what will happen as she grows toward 100 percent brain capacity while Jang and his thugs pursue her relentlessly.Being able to control matter comes in handy in a gunfight turns out.Besson puts some highfalutin concepts into play about the nature of life and intelligence and what weve done with it that sort of thing. But he cant stop himself from having fun. When Lucys boyfriend is trying to talk her into delivering the briefcase for instance he cuts to a quick shot of a mouse contemplating the cheese in a trap. When Jangs men are approaching her in the lobby of a hotel Besson makes a quick cut to a cheetah pursuing its prey.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixA tad obvious? Sure. Who cares? What saves ""Lucy"" in addition to Johanssons performance is Bessons sense of humor. Despite the serious-sounding subject matter he never takes any of it too seriously. Or if he does he misses the mark so badly that its funny anyway.The visuals are often stunning as we see what Lucy sees basically everything without distraction all at one time as her mental capacity increases. Johansson shifts into a monotone -- fitting since as she explains she no longer feels pain or emotion. The implication is that these are traits for those of us lower on the brain-function scale.AZCENTRALSummer movie guide 2014 releasesWith this ""Her"" and ""Under the Skin"" Johansson is on a roll of late. This film isnt the equal of those two but it doesnt really try to be. Besson seems instead determined to mix genres and ideas and let Johansson hold it all together.She does and ""Lucy"" is an unlikely romp as a result.Review Lucy 4 starsDirector Luc Besson.Cast Scarlett Johansson Morgan Freeman Min-sik Choi.Rating R for strong violence disturbing images and sexuality.AZCENTRALLucy (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Watch a clip from the film ""Lucy"" starring Scarlett Johansson Morgan Freeman and Min-sik Choi. Photo/Video Universal By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com July 24 2014 141 p.m. ET 7 COMMENTS Luc Bessons action spectaculars have always operated on a visceral level. Now he has added a cellular level. ""Lucy"" tracks the explosive growth of cells in its heroines brain which has been bumping along at 10% efficiency--the average were told for most of us struggling dummies--until something happens to push her up toward triple digits. The movie tracks more than cell growth of course since its title character played with impressive aplomb by Scarlett Johansson grows from a vaguely defined student living in Taiwan into the sort of superperson that Nietzsche envisaged even if he got the gender wrong. At the height of Lucys powers there is nothing she cant do--talk about a headstrong woman--and something of the same can be said for the film. It doesnt always keep track of its own logic at least not for this 10-percenter but its gleefully bold visually adventurous often funny strikingly concise--the whole heart-pounding tale is over in 90 minutes--and 100% entertaining. The first image we see is that of a cell dividing; these days biology is as hot a discipline on-screen as off. The narrative itself cleaves between Lucys evolution and an exposition of science and pseudoscience thats conveyed in a lecture-hall setting by a brain researcher named Prof. Samuel Norman. The professor is played with honeyed orotundity by Morgan Freeman and his lecture on cerebral efficiency is illustrated with exuberant multimedia. Mr. Freeman is an actor of such unassailable authority that he could make a case for two plus two equaling pi if the script required it. In this role though he simply speculates on what might happen if cerebral efficiency improved while we see what actually happens to Lucy as her IQ soars. More Reviews Magic in the Moonlight A Most Wanted Man The why of it happening is fairly straightforward. After brutal Korean bad guys force her to be a drug mule with a pouch sewn into her abdomen the pouch ruptures and her system is flooded by a newly synthesized and wildly dangerous substance that promotes runaway cell growth. The consequences of it happening are spectacular. Dendrites multiplying exponentially synapses firing ever faster and the guns in her hands blazing at anyone who stands in her way Lucy seeks out Prof. Norman whom she perceives as a resource and a refuge while contending with a level of stylized violence that evokes ""Pulp Fiction."" ENLARGE Scarlett Johansson in Lucy Universal Pictures All sorts of movie references are evoked in this fevered dream of a sci-fi thriller elements of ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde""; a variation on the preface to ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" in which an ape finds itself confronted not with a vertical slab but with Lucy seated in an office chair; a recapitulation of the same movies climax minus the planets and stars the star child and the Louis XVI furniture. The most obvious homage is the one Mr. Besson pays to himself--puissant women have been a hallmark of his most interesting features ""La Femme Nikita"" ""The Fifth Element"" and ""Angel-A."" (He also perpetrated his own lavishly trashy version of ""Joan of Arc."") Until now though his films havent been graced by a star of Ms. Johanssons gifts and its a collaboration made in pulp heaven. Ms. Johansson has played aspects of this role in the recent past--as the nameless womanlike creature in ""Under the Skin""; as Samantha the vocal soul of a smartphones operating system in ""Her."" Far from a problem thats one of many fascinating resonances in a constantly commanding performance. Lucy is Samanthas live-action soul sister; she too computes data at unthinkable speed while annihilating distance and time. ENLARGE Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson in Lucy Universal Pictures ""Lucy"" does present the problem at least for a while of understanding its heroines state of spirit at crucial junctures. What is she feeling if anything as she shoots her victims down? Why her faintly robotic head tic? Has she already taken leave of humanity? Such questions are eventually answered though and even poetically as in a scene between Lucy and a French cop and in a mesmerizing hospital sequence when Lucy grabs someones mobile phone and calls her mom. Thats when we get to feel what she feels which is a lot. Rewind DVD //Streaming //Download ENLARGE The Fifth Element (1997) Luc Bessons 23rd-century fantasy stars Bruce Willis as a Brooklyn cabbie Korben Dallas who saves the world by saving its designated savior. Her name is Leeloo she is played by Milla Jovovich and she has reached our planet disguised as a slightly sluttish sexpot along the lines of Barbarella by way of Nikita (as in Mr. Bessons violent action fantasy ""La Femme Nikita""). ""The Fifth Element"" swarms with nice aliens who look like giant bronze beetles and with nasty aliens who slobber doglike in the service of an evil genius Zorg whos played by Gary Oldman.

And yet the movie starring Scarlett Johansson has its sideline charms. July 25 2014 -- 833am Video (0228)  ""A Most Wanted Man"" is a good performance but not one of Hoffmans all-time best. ""Lucy"" is one of the most scientifically inaccurate movies ever made. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert And I thought the most scientifically inaccurate movie ever made was ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" Never underestimate Luc Besson whose sci-fi tinged thriller ""Lucy"" achieves a new high score on the science violation index. In every scene the French action maestro beats physics biology and common sense to a pulp. Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy an unwilling drug mule who attains superhuman abilities when a packet of synthesized uppers in her stomach ruptures. The drug allows her to harness the entire capacity of her brain. The film repeating a widespread myth asserts that the rest of us muddle through on just 10 percent of our cranial horsepower. Bessons target audience seems to be somewhere lower than that. Once Lucys whirlwind of mental energy is released she is able to absorb other languages instantly give herself a chameleon-like blonde-to-brunette makeover and telekinetically clout her enemies at a distance. She can comprehend all the biological processes in a persons body with an MRI-like hug monitor a citys worth of cellphone calls in her head and travel through time. Brainsmarts Basically shes a half a dozen X-Men in a miniskirt and stiletto heels. With great power come enormous side effects. Unless Lucy keeps taking the designer drug she gets uncontrollable fidgets and literally dissolves into a light show of neon space rays. The villain who sewed the packet into her stomach ultra-evil Mr. Jiang (the fine South Korean actor Choi Min-sik) would rather send a platoon of hit men after her than share his supply. Lucy hurts the murderous Jiang enough to make him furious but allows him to live. It doesnt take half a brain to know thats a dumb move. Then she partners with a tough Paris police detective (Amr Waked) whos basically on hand to gape at her miracles and provide a halfhearted romantic subplot. The bad guy attacks again and again but theres no urgency in this deity vs. gangster mismatch. Please dont think Im demanding too much plausibility from a fantasy film. I just saw a movie about a society of talking apes and I was fine with it. That movie established its premise set forth the laws of its fictional universe and stuck to them. At no point did a troop of flying monkeys with death rays appear just because somebody thought that would be neat. The movie worked because while preposterous it was consistent. Every scene gave you another reason to buy into its alternate dimension. Every egregious scene in ""Lucy"" defies you to ignore how ludicrous it is. Universal Studios Scarlett Johansson plays the title character in ""Lucy."" And yet ""Lucy"" has its sideline charms. Its a glossy production that virtually drips visual style. Its energetic in a funhouse-crazy way. Before the action begins to boil Besson tosses in numerous clips from magicians parlor tricks and nature documentaries to playful effect. Besson being Besson the wildlife vignettes show animals rutting. Morgan Freeman plays a renowned brain theorist patiently explaining the gibberish plot as if he were still on ""Sesame Street."" And for the first quarter hour when Johanssons character is a normal woman in frightening circumstances shes very effective. Once she attains cosmic consciousness however she goes blank-faced and dead-eyed as a mannequin. She even speaks in a droning monotone robo-voice far duller than the one she used as a hyperintelligent app in ""Her."" Like its dissolving heroine ""Lucy"" reaches to a finale that just sort of drifts apart and floats away. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Jessica Forde) Jessica Forde This image released by Universal Pictures shows Scarlett Johansson in a scene from ""Lucy."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Jessica Forde) Never underestimate Scarlett Johansson. Sure she looks like an inflatable sex doll but she played a deadly assassin in three Marvel movies and an alien succubus in ""Under the Skin."" Now as the title character in the dopey sci-fi thriller ""Lucy"" ScarJo has more knowledge in her pillowy lips than in all the universities on earth.Lucy is an American student in bustling Taipei Taiwan whose sleazeball boyfriend dupes her into a drug deal. On the receiving end of the mysterious briefcase is posh cut-throat Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) whos got a little job for Lucy to do. At the point of a gun shes implanted with a kidney-size packet of an experimental party drug that is bound for Europe.But before she can complete her assignment the packet leaks into her bloodstream turning Lucy into a super-sentient she-devil with vengeance on her brain. As the movie mutates from a stylized shoot-em-up to an inscrutable fantasy about bending time and space voice-of-reason Morgan Freeman is helpfully available to explain it for us simpletons. As in the slightly more lucid but less entertaining ""Transcendence"" he plays a scientist studying the limits of intelligence. His theory is that humans like all organisms are groping toward evolutionary perfection and if we learn to use more than 10 percent of our neurons we will become like gods.Evidently the new gods wont be merciful as Lucy doesnt use her shape-shifting wizardry to save civilian lives while she guns across Paris to find Mr. Jang and another infusion of the drug. Lucys big brain knows that it could explode at any moment so she uses an office-chair time machine to soak up all the history she can squeeze onto a flash drive. Were finally convinced that writer and director Luc Besson is hopped up on goofballs when Lucy touches her fingertip Sistine-Chapel style with the million-year-old primate that anthropologists have dubbed -- ahem -- Lucy. Although Besson the director of ""La Femme Nikita"" and the producer of ""Taken"" indulges in some operatic violence the film is more spacey than pacey. He cherry-picks elements from ""The Tree of Life"" and ""The Lawnmower Man"" and mashes them into a macabre concoction that looks cool but isnt meant to be digested.With such an empty core its hard to love ""Lucy"" but its also hard to change the channel when it promises wisdom with just a spoonful of Vitameatavegamin.What ""Lucy""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 130  Content Strong violence disturbing images and sexuality Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

(Jessica Forde/universal) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday July 24 2014 1200 PM Title Lucy Film Info With Scarlett Johansson Morgan Freeman. Sci-fi fantasy about a woman blessed -- or cursed -- with superintelligence. Director Luc Besson (130). R Graphic violence drugs. Area theaters. French action director Luc Besson has never been the most subtle of filmmakers. But Bessons work (""La Femme Nikita"" ""The Fifth Element"") achieves new levels of absurdity with ""Lucy"" a brazenly mindless thriller about the infinite capacities of the human brain. That said sometimes we just want to shut down and give in to bombastic summer entertainment. In that regard as usual Besson delivers. He knows Scarlett Johansson will hold our attention as Lucy an ordinary student whos kidnapped by a Taiwanese gangster Mr. Jang (Choi Min-sik). To import a powerful new drug into Europe Jang inserts a packet in Lucys abdomen for later retrieval. But the drug enters her bloodstream accidentally which causes her cells to go into hyperdrive. If youre the type to quibble over accuracy this is not the movie for you. Over the course of 24 hours she finds herself nearing 100% of her brain capacity -- instead of the usual 10%. Yes that number is a myth. But if youre the type to quibble over accuracy this is not the movie for you. With each leap forward Lucy develops new abilities. She tries to understand this with the help of a famed professor (an underused Morgan Freeman). Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson in Luc Bessons ""Lucy"" (Jessica Forde/universal) Unconcerned about say curing cancer or solving global warming she mostly just stalks hallways in a skin-tight minidress while searching out more stashes of the drug. She keeps talking about how smart shes becoming. Computer-generated effects show us the various ways she can transform and transport her body. But because Besson is so limited in his vision she resembles a gorgeous robot more than a fascinatingly evolved human being. Still the trippier effects are cool the pace rarely flags and Johansson has enough natural charisma to keep the character compelling. Fans might note that she played a similar role in last years arthouse hit ""Her"" as an operating system also grappling with rapidly expanding intelligence. The movies themselves however couldnt be more different. ""Her"" pushed us to expand our minds while ""Lucy"" works best if we switch them off entirely. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews lucy scarlett johansson morgan freeman sci fi/fantasty action luc besson choi min sik Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Sony Pictures Claudia Puig USA TODAY 752 p.m. EDT July 24 2014Scarlett Johansson has the title role in ""Lucy.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Scarlett Johansson is ideally cast as a rapidly evolving kick-ass hero in Lucy a stylish action thriller that is equal parts dazzling and ludicrous.As the brilliant scientist Professor Norman Morgan Freeman brings just the right dose of gravitas to an ambitious and engrossing popcorn movie ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).Johansson plays an unwitting drug mule who becomes super-human after accidentally absorbing the drug she has been forced to transport. Its a frighteningly potent substance a synthetic hormone called CPH4 which ruthless drug traffickers in Taipei sew into Lucys intestines for transport to Europe. Before she makes it out of Asia a beating makes the bag leak into her bloodstream. Lucy survives but goes into mental hyper-drive.USA TODAYThe latest movie reviewsUSA TODAYUSA TODAYs guide to summer moviesWith her ability to project vulnerability confidence and steely strength Johansson is convincing in a part that progresses from terrorized victim to increasingly brilliant hero.The 29-year-old actress has been making compelling choices lately. Last years roles included Joseph Gordon-Levitts dream Jersey girl in Don Jon; the engaging disembodied voice of an operating system in Her; and a seductive extra-terrestrial in Under the Skin. She also has played Russian superhero Black Widow in the Avengers series most recently in this years Captain America The Winter Soldier. It makes sense that someone who began her acting career at age 10 probably needs extremely diverse acting challenges as she approaches 30.In Lucy she plays the first human to harness 100% of her brainpower. In addition to Lucys smarts she gains the ability to become an assassin and is telekinetic and a time traveler.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Scarlett Johansson plays Lucy a woman forced to become a drug mule against her will. When the drugs leak inside her she is transformed into a superhuman warrior with unprecedented mental powers and a taste for vengeance. VPCBut there are moments of gentle wonder too. In an emotional phone call to her mother she tries to describe how she feels the rotation of the Earth and remembers her earliest days alive.Later she peers into the labyrinthine recesses of anothers brain to retrieve key information convinces people to do as she wants simply by staring at them and nimbly pilots a speeding car in a chase through the streets of Paris. Its giddy fun.One of the more obvious stumbling blocks however is the very premise the oft-repeated notion that humans use only 10% of their brains has recently been debunked. Still if disbelief is suspended theres an undeniable appeal to director Luc Bessons latest film which draws upon such disparate classics as 2001 A Space Odyssey Jurassic Park The Matrix and The Tree of Life. As with his 1990 film La Femme Nikita Besson clearly is drawn to powerful female action heroines.Initially Besson intercuts visuals of Lucy being menaced by drug lords with scenes of animals in the wild. The symbolism is anything but subtle.Once Lucy travels from Taipei to Paris (after a harrowing plane ride featuring splendid special effects simulating cells blasting free of her body) she joins forces with a French cop (Amr Waked) and Freemans Professor Norman. Neither cop nor scientist can do much but be transfixed by her rapidly evolving cognitive powers.The audience is in much the same position. Its tough not to be dazzled by this operatic action films blend of pop-philosophy biology and silly delirium.  121 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1rDQClf",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/24/lucy-review/11408497/,200,lucy30,lucy,usatoday

It didnt work out for anyone but at least Besson is back where he clearly feels more at home stylized violence punctuated by surreal chaos. In Lucy Scarlett Johansson plays an American party girl studying in Taiwan who is kidnapped and forced to be a drug mule for an Asian gangster (Choi Min-Sik). But when the pouch of mysterious blue crystals ruptures in her gut--following a savage beating--the wonder drug begins to expand her human potential at an alarming rate. First shes transformed into a sexy Jason Bourne out for revenge. Then she becomes Neo a superhero with near omnipotence. And her ultimate destiny before the high can wear off might be complete transcendence. On paper Lucy is nothing more than a standard Milla Jovovich action movie but Besson amps it up by going way past the recommended dosage of cinematic insanity. The whiplash imagery and frenetic editing give the audience a contact high of sorts--was that a freakin dinosaur?--transforming what should be ridiculous into genuine bizarro excitement. He has successfully crossbred the superhero film with the Asian-gangster genre and the films car chase through the streets of Paris might be one fetishists celebrate from now on. Lucy is a thinly drawn character just someone who needs to survive but Johansson vividly conveys the initial terror of her dire circumstances before shifting into the calculating almost robotic mode of an alien being flicking away mere mortals. By the time the film exhausts itself--in a brisk 89 minutes--it feels like theres literally nowhere that Lucy and Besson cant go no boundaries no laws no logic. Just go with it.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Who could have guessed that two radically different Scarlett Johansson vehicles--released within months of each other--would both court comparisons to 2001 A Space Odyssey and that one of them would be a brisk ludicrous action fantasy directed by French wunderkind-turned-studio-puppetmaster Luc Besson? Lucy stars Johansson as a hard-partying American expat who overdoses on a consciousness-expanding synthetic drug which grants her complete control over her body and memory and eventually over matter and time. It opens at the dawn of man and ends with its own version of 2001s ""Jupiter And Beyond The Infinite"" sequence with the title character seated in an all-white room watching the birth of the universe whizz by in reverse. Thats a more straightforward homage than anything in Under The Skin; its also a bit of a lark and a viewer gets the sense that by continually invoking Stanley Kubricks sci-fi touchstone Besson is making fun of himself. The first half of Lucy contains the most energetic and purely entertaining filmmaking Besson has produced since The Fifth Element packed with pulpy action pseudoscience title cards sped-up montages and teasing associative cuts. (A turn in a conversation is interrupted by a close-up of a mousetrap an explosion is replaced by a man exhaling cigarette smoke and so on and so forth.) The second half though hardly humorless overburdens itself with explaining its premise--which would be a serious buzzkill if said premise werent completely and totally nuts. At about the two-thirds mark the movies endearing daffiness gives way to outright psychedelia with the superhuman Lucy growing extra digits sprouting Akira-like tendrils to absorb computer servers whole and using her time-warping abilities to meet dinosaurs and re-enact (or is that pre-enact?) Michelangelos The Creation Of Adam with one of her hirsute ancestors. Lucy opens with its naive heroine (Johansson seems to be channelling Shirley MacLaine circa 1960) agreeing to deliver a briefcase for Richard (A Hijackings Pilou Asbaek) her skeevy cowboy-hat-wearing boyfriend-of-the-week. The recipients turn out to be a Korean drug cartel led by Jang (the great Choi Min-sik best known as the lead in Oldboy) a pitch-black villain in the mold of The Fifth Elements Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg. Hes introduced stepping over a dead body and then motioning for a valet to pour bottled water over his hands so he can wash the blood off.  Against her will Lucy is forced to become a drug mule for Jang whose underlings sew a packet of CPH4--an experimental pharmaceutical they want to market as a designer drug to European rich kids--into her abdomen. It doesnt take long for that packet to burst granting Lucy powers that are supposedly tied to the untapped potential of the brain (the opening stretch is intercut with a lecture delivered by world-renowned pseudoscientist Professor Norman played by Morgan Freeman) but are really just an excuse for Besson to let his imagination run wild. After her body absorbs its first near-lethal dose of CPH4 Lucy becomes effectively invulnerable and the movie follows her as she barrels through Taipei and later Paris trapping thugs in invisible boxes disassembling guns with her mind diagnosing kidney problems through touch and shooting everyone left and right. Mishmashes of near-nihilistic violence and shamelessly sappy sentimentality are Bessons stock-in-trade (see La Femme Nikita The Professional or his script for Taken); here the combination feels more palatable than usual in part because the violence always registers as unreal. It helps that the movie seems to take place in an alternate universe with its own biology. In one scene Lucys cells decide its time to jump ship and her face and fingertips begin to disappear into a sandstorm of flesh-colored matter.Calling the whole thing dumb would be a disservice but not because theres anything especially smart going on under the movies surface. Rather the sheer weirdness of Lucys imagery--a telekinesis-assisted car chase a USB stick containing all the knowledge of the universe people growing animal limbs--prevents it from registering as run-of-the-mill summertime ""dumb fun."" It comes across instead as a directorial flight of fancy an imaginatively goofy take on an already goofy idea exaggerated by Bessons blunt style and an uncommonly fast pace.

Where does Luc Bessons so so stupid (and not in a good way) sci-fi thriller go from there? Millions of years forward to modern-day Taipei where sorta ditzy Lucy (Scarlett Johansson doing a for-dummies riff on her alien turn in Under the Skin) is forced to be a drug mule for a stoic Korean gangster (Choi Min-sik). But after a particularly rough night Lucys surgically implanted narcotics packet starts leaking into her system. And lets just say its some primo shit--an experimental stimulant that unlocks corners of the brain never used by humankind. Sounds super awesome right? If only. The action sequences are few and far between and all of them are rendered in that mind-numbing Besson style thats heavy on the lugubrious slo-mo and winking fetishization. There should be a charge watching Johansson shoot her way into a penthouse suite while classical music blares but you can barely manage a shrug because it never rises above cool-factor calculation. Bessons more interested in the tales Z-grade intellectual components anyway As Lucys egghead confidant (Morgan Freeman befuddling his way to a paycheck) tells us most humans only use 10 percent of their brain--in reality a widely debunked urban myth. But what if we could access all 100 percent of our cerebral capacity? Apparently we could make gun-toting henchmen levitate time-travel with the ease of flipping pages on an iPad and collect every scrap of wisdom from here to eternity on a truly universal USB drive. The funny thing about all these sub-Matrix shenanigans is that theyre genuinely meant to stoke thought and reflection. Frankly though few movies have left me feeling as shorn of gray matter.

Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW Lucy Running time 90 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity). At the Kips Bay the Empire the 34th Street others. Its been the year of the supersmarts for Scarlett Johansson Picture the artificial-intelligence program she played in ""Her"" deploying her powers to bust legs instead of hearts and youre halfway to ""Lucy."" Throwing in elements from ""X-Men"" and even ""2001"" writer-director Luc Besson serves up a tantalizing sci-fi tale of an American naif (Johansson) who in Taipei is forced by her boyfriend to deliver a briefcase to Chinese gangsters who turn her into a drug mule. The drug shes carrying -- sewn into her abdomen -- turns out to be a chemical manufactured during pregnancy that makes adults develop like rocket-boosted fetuses. While fending off a rape shes beaten so badly the drug seeps into her system. Building on the commonly held myth that people use only 3 to 5 percent of their brain capacity Besson tells us (via a professor/explainer played by Morgan Freeman) that Lucy can achieve undreamed-of powers as the drug unlocks ever more of her potential. With her brainpower at 30 percent she gains body-regulating powers mindreading telekinesis ... Should she reach 98 percent capacity were talking omnipotence like the Star Child in ""2001."" Besson keeps the pedal down for 90 breathless minutes sprinkling the road with dry wit but occasionally taking detours into beautiful quiet side streets. One of several moments of grace comes when Lucy -- named for the earliest discovered human ancestor -- is being operated on without anesthesia. To kill time she calls her mother and tells her she can feel everything remember everything. ""I remember the taste of your milk in my mouth"" she says tearing up in contemplation of the beauty of total inner consciousness. This isnt the kind of scene that occurs much in your average ""Transformers"" or ""Godzilla"" flick ""Lucy"" has soul albeit disguised as ass-kicking. If Besson often seems as if hes using only 3 to 5 percent of his mental capacity (""3 Days to Kill"" ""The Family"" and a dozen other terrible movies he wrote and/or directed) ""Lucy"" contains as well as celebrates ideas This one could be the centerpiece of a discussion of masculine versus feminine superpowers. When the bad guys line up with guns she responds not like Wolverine but dismisses everything with a cruel wave that freezes the mobsters (and pastes them to the ceiling). Its nonviolent yet humiliating like a cheerleader spurning a nerd. Made with a male star ""Lucy"" would have lost much of its intriguing subtext. A Paris cop (Amr Waked) whos furious when Lucy takes the steering wheel for a chase later admits hes not sure he can be of any help. Its the sci-fi take on all those sociology books about ascendant women rendering men irrelevant. In a captivating climax the movie turns attractively freaky though somewhat marred by cheesy special effects and theres a huge debt to the immense leaps of ""2001."" An abrupt ending feels frustrating and leaves questions floating in space. Then again Im using only 3 to 5 percent of my capacity so what do I know?

TWITTER Scarlett Johansson plays a woman whose freshly unleashed brain gives her superpowers. A fantasy about unlocking 100 percent of the brains potential that expects viewers to be using just 2 or 3 percent of their own gray matter Luc Bessons Lucy plays more like a big dumb superhero flick than sci-fi The powers Scarlett Johansson gains when given full access to her brain quickly outstrip anything one can imagine 3 pounds of skull-bound neurons and synapses being able to do. Bessons script offers neither the well-drawn character dynamics nor the clear motivations of a decent comic book origin story and as it is quickly clear that no baddie has much chance of stopping Lucy action sequences carry little weight. A top-shelf cast and the (fading) memory of Bessons action hits will help the picture at the box office but word of mouth is unlikely to keep it alive long after a strong opening weekend. Johanssons character begins as a party girl studying in Taipei whose new boyfriend (Julian Rhind-Tutt) is involved in bad stuff. Thanks to him she winds up being an unwilling drug mule for Jang (Choi Min-sik making the most of a role that forces him to speak through interpreters). A big bag of a superdrug called CPH4 is sewn into her guts awaiting transport to new markets in Europe. But the bag springs a leak when Lucy is roughed up by her captors entering her system in such quantities (cue fun CG shots of cellular-level transformations) that it activates huge chunks of cranial real estate shed never been able to access before -- like that little-known lobe that lets you turn off gravity when it suits you. Helpfully Besson has been cutting between Lucys story and an academic lecture in Paris where researcher Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman) has been hypothesizing about the very thing that is happening to her making remarkably specific predictions about what might happen if humans were able to use more than the 10 percent we currently use (a myth by the way) of the magnificent supercomputers in our heads. His ideas like some of the films other early scenes are illustrated with cutaways to nature footage suggesting the ways in which all of Earths creatures are interconnected governed by the same laws. Think Luc Besson doing The Tree of Life. The early stages of Lucys transformation offer plenty of kicks and even a touching moment or two After making her badass escape from Jang and his thugs she struts into the nearest hospitals operating room shoots the patient on the table -- a glance at the X-rays told her the patients brain tumor was inoperable -- and has a surgeon pull out the remaining drugs planted inside her. Forgoing anesthesia she borrows the surgeons phone and calls her mother while he cuts her open describing whats going on in her head. ""Mom I can feel everything"" she says as the camera almost imperceptibly rocks; sensations and emotions stretching back to her birth are available to her triggering what proves to be almost the last human-like response she has in the film. From here on out Johanssons performance grows colder and more analytical. Besson doesnt let her become as persuasively alien as she is in Under the Skin but he doesnt want a human either. Lucy sets out to round up other batches of the drug and get to Paris where she can let Dr. Norman see his theories in action. Why do this one wonders when in a matter of minutes she has already read his thousands of pages of research and surpassed his understanding? Plenty of films and novels have envisioned what would happen if we gained conscious control over our entire brain. While most would probably make a real neuroscientist cackle uncontrollably its hard to recall one whose ideas were more laughable than this one. We may roll with the film as its heroine learns Taiwanese over the course of a cab ride or sees the electromagnetic spectrum of cellphone calls swiping through them as if she were reading their conversations on a touchscreen. We may even buy it when shes able to change her body at will -- sure growing a webbed hand would take some time and fuel but at least a bodys cells are controlled by its brain. But the film gives not the slightest justification for Lucys increasingly godlike abilities which soon include time travel and levitation. Every now and then a nugget of real philosophy is dropped into the screenplay but its surrounded by so much blather that even a generous viewer has trouble using it to justify what Lucy experiences. Even more damning in an action film Besson doles out powers in a way that nullifies much of the drama to come. Once weve seen this woman put an entire room of people to sleep with the wave of a hand why would we be worried for her when a smaller gang is pointing guns at her? (And why wouldnt she just pull the same trick here instead of wasting her time with showier and less believable feats?) The movie occasionally attempts to make Lucys quest accessible to mortal viewers. Though she doesnt need the assistance of a French cop named Del Rio (Amr Waked) for instance she keeps him with her as ""a reminder"" of her fading humanity. But the reality-based action (a long wrong-way trip through Paris traffic; a showdown with gangsters who want their drugs back) feels irrelevant to what the film really wants to show us. Unfortunately though it concludes with a line suggesting Lucy has finally found all the answers Lucy never tells us what the question is.

Audiences this year have already been subjected to ""Transcendence"" in which Johnny Depp basically eats the internet and now weve got ""Lucy"" starring Scarlett Johansson as an unwitting mule whose ingestion of mass quantities of a new club drug pushes her past the limit of the usual 10% of brain power that humans supposedly use. ""Lucy"" doesnt make a lick more sense than ""Transcendence"" did -- even though both feature Morgan Freeman working overtime to talk us through the proceedings -- but at least ""Lucy"" has the good fortune to be written and directed by Luc Besson which means that while the results may be cuckoo-bananas theyre never boring. See video Scarlett Johansson Accidentally Accesses 100 Percent of Her Brain Power in First Lucy Trailer Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is a freewheeling expat American in Taiwan blowing off her studies for nightclub carousing until the day her boyfriend handcuffs a briefcase to her arm and sends her to see fearsome mobster Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi star of the original ""Oldboy""). In a hilariously tense sequence (involving barked orders that have to be translated by a voice on the speaker-phone) Lucy discovers that the case is full of blue drug crystals (not unlike the Heisenberg mix on ""Breaking Bad""). Not long after she wakes up with a bandage around her midriff and learns that a bag of the stuff has been hidden in her lower intestine. Before she can reach her destination a flunky of Jangs kicks her in the gut releasing the blue stuff into her system. Mind you this isnt crystal or ecstasy were talking here; its a synthesized version of a hormone released by pregnant women to make their babies develop but in Lucy it causes a cellular reaction that gives her powers both mental and physical. (When the bag-rupture first happens she goes full Fred Astaire in ""Royal Wedding"" rolling up the walls and across the ceiling.) Besson then throws various ticking clocks at us Lucy has to capture the drugs from the other three mules with the help of a French narcotics officer named seriously Pierre Del Rio (Amr Waked); Lucy has to hook up with legendary brain-guy scientist Professor Norman (Freeman) before her physical form shuts down entirely; and of course Mr. Jang is in hot pursuit although he and his thugs become less and less interesting as the story goes along. Were dealing with a lead character after all who slips the shackles of time and space to perceive everything that has ever been. Once your heroine has become one with the universe its hard to get worked up over a dude with a gun even if its Oldboy. Also read Scarlett Johansson in First Action-Starring Role Lucy Is Poised to Kick Box-Office Butt Freeman as is his wont does a lot of explaining; hes not a character so much as the narrator of the audiobook of your stereo instructions telling an audience (and subsequently us) how the brain works what it does and doesnt do and why dolphins have amazing abilities based on their usage of 20% of their brains. As for whats going on in Luc Bessons brain its anyones guess. He makes movies crammed with ridiculous situations absurd action and dialogue that frequently sounds like it was written in English translated to his native French and then translated back into English. Bessons movies are never dull though and that alone makes his loony flights of fancy and pretentious stabs at deeper meaning between the shoot-outs tolerable. Also read Universal Moves Scarlett Johanssons Lucy Up Against Hercules Cameron Diaz Sex Tape Still if youre expecting Black Widow-style fight choreography for Johansson think again After a few early gun battles and mano-a-mano moments she pretty much Obi-Wans her enemies into submission. Add her increasingly droning speech as her brainpower increases and the performance becomes more and more puzzling stripping away everything that makes her such a magnetic screen presence. If you want to see an otherworldly Johansson struggling with her bizarre powers youre better off renting ""Under the Skin."" (To be fair this will probably be the only movie where youll ever see the actress stare glassily as she rapid-fire types up a storm on two side-by-side laptops.) ""Lucy"" is a confounding experience but at a brisk 85 or so minutes it manages not to outstay its welcome. Those not enamored of Bessons particular brand of Euro-schlock grindhouse existentialism however may find their brains more stimulated elsewhere. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

After her mesmerizingly out-there performances as an artificially intelligent being in ""Her"" and a come-hither extraterrestrial in ""Under the Skin"" Scarlett Johansson takes a logical next step into the title role of ""Lucy"" an agreeably goofy high-concept speculative thriller about the first human being to successfully harness 100% of her brainpower. In no other sense however does the word ""logical"" apply to writer-director Luc Bessons return to blockbuster form -- which is to say his latest aggressively stylish self-consciously feminist gratuitously globe-trotting pulp-trash extravaganza. Giddily recycling everything from ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Matrix"" to yakuza actioners and National Geographic documentaries its a garish trippy wildly uneven and finally quite disarming piece of work graced by a moment-to-moment unpredictability that will pique audience curiosity but may put off those who prefer their summer movies on the more conventional side. Although it represents a significant roll of the dice as the most expensive project ever undertaken by the filmmakers EuropaCorp shingle ""Lucy"" should capitalize on its strong international elements and Johanssons bankability to become Bessons biggest worldwide hit as a director since ""The Fifth Element"" no small feat for an f/x-heavy original property in this over-franchised day and age. And unlike that bloated 1997 dystopian juggernaut the film manages to clock in at a surprisingly sleek and multiplex-friendly 88 minutes and its abrupt but elegant conclusion has the curious benefit of making this extravagantly silly entertainment seem somehow smarter and more enigmatic in retrospect than it does while its unfolding. Certainly the opening scenes dont inspire much confidence that Besson is operating at anywhere near his full intellectual capacity or that he expects any such smarts from his audience. After a brief prehistoric flashback to the dawn of man the film quickly deposits us in present-day Taipei where Lucy (Johansson) a hard-partying American blonde finds herself lured into the web of a ruthless Korean crime boss named Mr. Jang (the splendidly villainous Choi Min-sik). This entire sequence is laughably intercut with nature-doc footage of cheetahs pouncing on their prey just in case we fail to grasp our heroines trapped condition. Terrified out of her mind Lucy is forced to become a drug mule with a bag containing a highly potent synthetic substance called CPH4 sewn into her stomach. When the bag bursts (Besson happily supplies a visceral closeup of her insides) Lucy not only miraculously survives the overdose but also begins to experience some unintended and not entirely unwelcome side effects. The reason soon becomes clear Rather than being restricted to the use of a mere 10% of her brain she is suddenly able to access 20% and then 30% and so on -- an unprecedented feat whose implications are unpacked at some length by the Paris-based researcher Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman). (The well-documented fact that humans actually do use most of their brains manages to debunk the movies premise without in any way detracting from its loopy pleasures.) Lucys condition manifests itself gradually at first then in ever grander and more astonishing ways. No longer cowering in fear shes now an expert assassin who quickly frees herself and turns the tables on her captors. Although shes largely immune to pain her powers of sensory perception reach superhuman levels of acuity -- a phenomenon visualized by Besson and his visual-effects team as an endless network of data streams invisible to the naked eye. She absorbs vast quantities of data (especially foreign languages) in record time and develops the ability to manipulate matter telekinetically which as Lucy learns comes in pretty handy whether youre trying to disarm an opponent or weave your way in and out of traffic. But even as her cognitive command increases (the film keeps upping her brain percentage every 10 minutes or so) so does her awareness that she will not be able to survive much longer in this state as her trillions of cells each one now uniquely empowered begin to behave in the manner of a rapidly metastasizing cancer. (One particularly dazzling CG sequence set aboard an airplane reveals her individual particles struggling to break free of their corporeal prison.) And so not unlike the poisoned hero of the 1950 noir ""D.O.A."" Lucy finds herself in a race against time and her own body. Traveling from Taiwan to France -- visually speaking that means from Taipei 101 to the Eiffel Tower -- shes aided by the good professor and a bemused cop (Egyptian actor Amr Waked) in her quest to bring her enemies to justice and also to use her superior knowledge for the good of humanity. On an almost admirably perverse level ""Lucy"" isnt really much of a thriller -- its virtually an anti-thriller devoid of suspense or any real sense of danger due to the fact that its heroine is more or less invincible. At times its hard to shake the sense that a smarter more unbridled picture might have found a way to slip the bonds of genre altogether. But if the movie fizzles somewhat as action its because Besson seems more interested in engaging playfully yet seriously with the various biological philosophical and metaphysical riddles that his story raises. Pointedly Lucy gets a couple of eloquent monologues in which to ponder such weighty matters as the impermanence of all life the preciousness of every moment the human tendency to prioritize feeling over thinking the depressing myopia of human experience in general and the fact that life gains meaning only with the passage of time. One reason ""Lucy"" emerges an enjoyably nutty diversion rather than a self-important slog is that it pays deft knowing homage to any number of Hollywood sci-fi head-trip classics embedding its ideas in a dense labyrinth of cinematic references that somehow end up feeling sly rather than shopworn. In trying to locate mankinds precarious position within the greater cosmic order while also anticipating the literally mind-blowing next phase of human evolution Bessons film carries unmistakable traces of both ""2001"" and ""The Tree of Life."" (Some of it even takes place in outer space.) Lucys gradual rise to omniscience and omnipotence recalls Neos own such journey in ""The Matrix"" while her many black-suited Korean opponents suggest another army of Agent Smiths (Asian Smiths?). And in those moments when Lucy uploads herself Big Brother-style to every computer and TV screen in the vicinity the movie cant help but suggest a livelier less ponderous remake of this years similar-themed ""Transcendence."" Not least among these allusions to other movies are the obvious echoes of Bessons own. Like ""La Femme Nikita"" ""Leon The Professional"" and ""The Fifth Element"" before it ""Lucy"" is a slickly engineered showcase for a kickass heroine whom we instinctively unhesitatingly root for. It also feels like a calculated bid for popularity with a younger American audience that may be unfamiliar with this particular Gallic genre maestro (the ""Taken"" movies he produced notwithstanding). Certainly after the bland history lesson of ""The Lady"" and the joyless family-friendly shenanigans of the ""Arthur"" trilogy this is easily the directors most alert energized and recognizable piece of direction in years -- a movie that with its muscular widescreen imagery vibrant streaks of color and pulsing musical beats as well as its occasional tonal missteps and moments of unintentional hilarity feels unmistakably like the work of its director. In the end though its Johansson our resident avatar of the otherworldly who goes the furthest in bringing all these disparate elements together. In ""Her"" the actress gave voice to a higher more sophisticated form of consciousness and in ""Under the Skin"" she managed the tricky feat of regarding humanity through alien eyes. In some ways Lucy represents the point at which both roles converge and Johansson has the unusually difficult job here of subtly conveying her characters observations reactions and eventual epiphanies in a mostly deadpan flattened-out register that becomes only more subdued as the film progresses. Somehow she succeeds beyond all reason. Indeed during the movies ludicrous-bordering-on-sublime final minutes marked by whooshing camera movements and a highly malleable sense of time its hard not to wonder if Lucy -- fully free at last and with infinite possibilities at her fingertips -- might be intended as a hopeful thinly veiled stand-in for Besson himself. Not for nothing one suspects is the characters first name but one letter removed from his own. Film Review LucyReviewed at Arclight Cinemas Hollywood July 22 2014.

Nick says January 25 2015 at 546 pm i have one question how long did it take them to film this movie? i cant find the answer anywhere. Reply Jack Smith says August 21 2014 at 1130 am Just a general statement which applies to all reviewers. Step back and take a breath folks. Movies are for entertainment fun and thinking outside of the box. They do not have to totally make sense but they do have to entertain. Action movies are supposed to have plenty of action whether it makes total sense or not. It is where the imagination runs loose and graphics flow freely and actively. It past methods are used and shown in a new fashion/light-fine. A person does not attend a movie with clipboard in hand like a educator/technical writer waiting to put check marks for items that are not right or does not confer to the norm (with the norm being in the eye of the beholder). I have seen many movies that I have enjoyed for which a strait-jacketed professional reviewer has slammed for not having this or that. Possibly they all need to go see the movie just to relax and have fun not as object to dissect. Reply me says July 28 2014 at 848 am This would have come off better as a James Bond flick ""Mr Bond we can do a deal Ill buy you a delicatessen in stainless steel"" Reply Dean Loomis says July 28 2014 at 219 am Difficult to argue with success yet this movie reaches some place beyond riidiculous. Poorly written and incredibly badly directed it drowns itself in a pool of pretention. I just cant get over it Besson who was once a fairly good director has probably forgotten the basics of movie making. When a director has to show us an insert of an animal being surrounded by tigers about to catch it to make us understand how S.J feels when she is surrounded by thugs then I guess one can only wonder where his talent went. Reply Abbella Di Noto says July 25 2014 at 130 pm I dont care if some say the science in this film is Preposterous And it actually is not It is mind blowing a lot of action a lot of thrill a lot of skill.  The cinematography is pure The acting is perfection Scarlet J is the only actress for this film. Morgan f. Reprises his former roles as a amalgamation of Mr fox (wanted) and his narration efforts of March of the penguins so the casting is spot on It really works the momentum of this film moves quick and only mildly slow when it needs to explain science to the people who dont understand much about it. That it but that is only in tiny doses so it is perfect. I love the opening how it explains what is happening to Lucy by using quick images of mouse approaching a trap and a antelope being stalked by a pride of cheetah You get the idea. I think even if you are not a science enthusiast or someone who devourers Documentaries as food you WILL STILL LOVE THIS FILM There are parts in this film that make you nearly run for cover or say oh ..you know what.. Over and over See this In Big D  D Box  Anywhere there is a big screen and hi def sound YOU WONT REGRET havent seen transcendence yet But it kinda reminds me of that .Scarlett As the J Dep character Reply Sydney Chandler says July 23 2014 at 1230 pm I sneaked a look at the film and it was entertaining. Its not a chick flick or a guys T amp; A fest but a really fun movie with lots of action and a little something for everyone. I wouldnt get too literal or think youve wandered into Shakespeare it does exactly what it was designed to do....entertain. Nothing more nothing less. Just enjoy the ride and youll be fine. Reply Jordan N. says July 23 2014 at 1133 am Problem with the premise we dont ""only use 10% of our brain."" That is an urban myth. Movies like this and ""Limitless"" that repeat it only serve to perpetuate the myth or for the knowledgeable they base their story on a premise that is too absurd to buy into the movie in the slightest. Reply Sherry says July 23 2014 at 1208 pm Thank you; I cant believe how many people think this is true just because it has been repeated so much over time. Reply sweetlittleblackkitty says July 23 2014 at 914 am I hope the movies as fun as the review Reply See All 9 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO President On Vinyls Demise On-Screen Violence -TCA Chelsea Vs.

Luc Bessons ""Lucy"" in which Scarlett Johansson plays a superwoman able to play god with her scientifically enhanced mind makes a pretty compelling case. Besson who hasnt directed a satisfying action vehicle since ""The Fifth Element"" in 1997 doesnt exactly return to form here so much as scatter it all over the place with the committed Johansson providing a unifying force at the center of the madness. Though Bessons screenplay toys clumsily with big ideas involving the history of human consciousness the plot is simple The Tapei-based Lucy (Johansson) agrees to deliver a package to the mob on behalf of her boyfriend whos promptly killed. Captured by the bad guys shes forced into surgery in which the henchmen place a package of drugs into her abdomen in the hopes of turning her into their mule. Instead when the packet is accidentally punctured Lucy absorbs their power. Providing de facto narration these scenes are intercut with a lectured delivered by a psychology professor (Morgan Freeman) on the untapped possibilities of the human mind Turns out we only use 1% What might happen if we harnessed its full powers? As Lucys eyes turn blue we find out. And thats when ""Lucy"" shifts from a patently dumb movie -- when Lucy is first captured Besson cuts to shots of a cheetah ensnaring its prey -- to a dumb movie that has a terrific time as it goes flying off the rails. Lucy shoots and kicks her way to freedom finds a doctor to explain her condition and battles through hordes of other baddies to get to Freeman and share her revelations about life the universe and everything. The sheer mania that Besson brings to individual showdowns allows it to earn its outright ridiculousness. In the final moments the entire enterprise literally collapses into a singularity of light sound and action as if even Besson himself cant contain the cockamamie premise hes dreamed up. Until then theres plenty of enjoyably bonkers moments. When Lucy forces a surgeon at gunpoint to remove the drugs from her bowels she casually makes a call to her mother in the process too smart to even flinch at the pain. She kisses a baffled police officer just to remind herself about love. A closing shootout inexplicably involves rocket launchers and a blank white environment that harkens back to ""THX-1138."" Through it all handy title cards keep track of Lucys evolving brain power in increments of 10 percent as if shes proceeding through levels of a video game. In fact the movie excels at foregrounding a video game aesthetic with its narrative. Lucy knocks out one group of assailants with the wave of her hand later forcing another to levitate with comical results. But if shes an excellent gamer shes also found the ultimate cheat code -- the characters so powerful that shes never really in danger which prevents the movie from generating any real sense of suspense. Still Bessons underlying concept is so absurd that ""Lucy"" never lacks urprise. The only predictable ingredient is its femme fatale a motif found throughout Bessons filmography ever since 1990s ""La Femme Nikita."" With Johanssons electrifying turn the conceit of a tough woman defying the powerful men around her takes on cartoonish dimensions. In addition to offering a strong female superhero still a rarity it winds up providing a companion piece to Johanssons similarly domineering turn in Jonathan Glazers ""Under the Skin"" where she plays a seductive alien stalking male prey. Both movies find Johansson transforming into an unearthly being coming to grips with foreign senses proving her willingness to use her physicality in unique ways. One shot in ""Lucy"" that finds the title character suddenly evaporating into particles while hiding an airplane bathroom which bears a marked similarity to an effect used repeatedly in ""Under the Skin"" ranks among one of the wildest scenes of the year. Ultimately Besson is better at finding charged moments than fusing them together but its impossible to ignore his maniacal vision. Various moments pulsate with fragmented possibilities alternately channeling the adrenaline-fueled ""Crank"" movies ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Matrix"" never achieving their greatness but capturing tidbits of its DNA. As ""Lucy"" builds toward its climax the movie concludes with a series of visual punchlines rather than any tidy conclusion. Theres never any question as to the inherent silliness but Besson makes it endearing and unexpected anyway delivering an unapologetically stupid antidote to stupid movies that dont even bother to try something different. ""Lucy"" doesnt hold together but with its flashy innovation Bessons trying to freshen the formula. Its the kind of freewheeling mess of a movie you wish studios would try out more often. Grade B- ""Lucy"" opens nationwide on Friday.

Whereas this one turned into Matrix style. fun ride though Reply TruthTeller May 12 2016 1120 am This movie was extremely disappointing. It could have been so much better with a different ending. She should never have gotten to 100%. That would have been the better thing to dangle out there. I mean what is is that we would achieve with 100% of our brain being used? To disperse and be everything and nothing at the same time? Big deal. Reply Abbella Di Noto May 12 2016 1120 am I dont care if some say the science in this film is Preposterous And it actually is not It is mind blowing a lot of action a lot of thrill a lot of skill.  The cinematography is pure The acting is perfection Scarlet J is the only actress for this film. Morgan f. Reprises his former roles as a amalgamation of Mr fox (wanted) and his narration efforts of March of the penguins so the casting is spot on It really works the momentum of this film moves quick and only mildly slow when it needs to explain science to the people who dont understand much about it. That it but that is only in tiny doses so it is perfect. I love the opening how it explains what is happening to Lucy by using quick images of mouse approaching a trap and a antelope being stalked by a pride of cheetah You get the idea. I think even if you are not a science enthusiast or someone who devourers Documentaries as food you WILL STILL LOVE THIS FILM There are parts in this film that make you nearly run for cover or say oh ..you know what.. Over and over See this In Big D  D Box  Anywhere there is a big screen and hi def sound YOU WONT REGRET havent seen transcendence yet But it kinda reminds me of that .Scarlett As the J Dep character Reply dave May 12 2016 1120 am it looks like a poorly scripted sci-fi channel c rated movie set to boobs Reply Jeffrey May 12 2016 1120 am Having just watched the film I must say that I was slightly underwhelmed. The sensory overload is distracting at best during certain stretches. The cerebral side of the film is very deep and forces the viewers to ask themselves several good questions. As for the 10% myth it isnt really the focus of the film albeit the thread that is used to lace the filmmakers questions together. The main focus seems to be aimed at forcing the audience to internally question their own self awareness. I really wish the characters had been fleshed out a bit more in fact I feel that I was cheated by the film not being long enough in runtime to actually allow more substantial progression. So in conclusion... my personal advice save the money by not going to theaters to watch the film...but definitely watch the film. I wish that I would have saved the money but I will without doubt watch this movie again. Reply Victoria May 12 2016 1120 am Hey Gary amp; Ron Sounds like you two should hook up for an ""irrational (un)apologetic"" summer fling ;-p Reply Gary May 12 2016 1120 am As much as I love Luc Besson I cant stand the ""we only use 10% of our brains"" trope so much that Im already tired of the movie before having seen it.
