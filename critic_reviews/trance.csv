Facebook Twitter Print Movies The Problem With Saints On the lifeless Jackie Robinson biopic 42. Plus Danny Boyles twisty Trance. by Wesley Morris on April 11 2013 Whenever it is that an icon passes from being human to being a saint is the point at which its probably too late for a good movie. All you get is the lessons learned and very little of the naturalism or idiosyncrasy or personality that made the person iconic in the first place. Or you get all that courtesy of a great performance but then theres no filmmaking or storytelling to support it. You rarely get both acting and an angle the way you did say with Walk the Line and Lincoln. Its usually that the subjects mean so much to the filmmakers that they cant bring themselves to take the subjects out of their historical packaging and play with them lest they lose their value. Thats the Jackie Robinson situation. In 1950 Robinson played himself in The Jackie Robinson Story which was basically a hero giving a feel-good book report on himself. Hes been in bubble wrap ever since. But after turning down other movies including one Spike Lee and Denzel Washington wanted to make Robinsons widow Rachel finally said yes. So 66 years after Robinson became the first black major league baseball player here we are with 42 which has been made with such reverence for Robinsons importance that Robinson is barely there. Brian Helgeland (Payback A Knights Tale) wrote and directed this movie which concentrates on Robinsons debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers and sometime after the halfway point he lays out his angle. Its Robinsons (Chadwick Boseman) first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 and for each at-bat against the Phillies Philadelphia manager Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) leaves the dugout and proceeds to call him ""n--- "" the way youd call your dog into the house. Its a good scene that goes on long enough to leave a simmer in your blood. And after he pops up during his next-to-last at-bat with Chapman still going Robinson leaves the plate steps down into the tunnel beside the dugout howls out his rage smashes a bat and crumples to the ground. While hes crumpled Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) the Dodgers general manager who hired Robinson appears and proceeds to explain that his controversial hire cant get mad since thats what the bigots expect. Theres too much riding on his player for him to run out of cheeks to turn. (But Robinson already knows this. In one of his first scenes he calmly but tensely threatens to go elsewhere for gas after the white service station manager refuses to let him use the bathroom.) Rickeys pep talk puts Robinson in the movies thematic place. His function is only curative ""Youre medicine Jackie."" 42 is a Hollywood movie about American racism in which the objects of that racism must summon their most noble selves. Helgeland whos white doesnt imagine how it must have felt being slurred as relentlessly as Robinson was. So Robinson serves as a lesson not in triumph but in tolerance. This is the sort of movie in which Jackie and Rachel Robinson (Nicole Beharie) dont have to change. White America does. Thats great for messaging but hell on drama. All the changing here happens to the players and the management of the Dodgers organization. Helgeland skillfully writes around the problem of how white racism affects non-racist whites. And hes a smart sensitive-enough writer to make this an interesting worthy emotional pursuit. The players draft an anti-Robinson petition not long after his arrival and one by one find themselves changing their minds. Robinson was never a problem for Pee Wee Reese whom Lucas Black plays but when the Dodgers wind up in Cincinnati he shows Rickey a threatening letter someone wrote him and worries that his relatives in Kentucky will go bananas. Then Rickey shows Reese the pounds of hate mail that Robinson gets Reese goes out on the field puts his arm around his teammate and lets the crowd savor the image. Having an actor play Robinson makes sense for realism but most of the time a piece of cardboard with Robinsons likeness would have done the trick. Boseman has very little to do that makes Robinson a character. His best scenes are usually somewhere on the baseball field. The challenge in them for an actor is to find a way to combine Robinsons athleticism with his joy at being an athlete. He puts some cocky comedy into his base stealing and a little bit of sex into the performance. Beharie is a strong charismatic actor who needs a great role. (Here shes playing a great woman and thats not the same thing.) Most of the other black characters like the sports reporter Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) have nothing to them but their goodness. Smith is turned into a glorified butler for Robinson. And theres an embarrassing couple of scenes with a precious tyke who were told during the closing credits will grow up to be Ed Charles who played for the Mets and Athletics. He explains plays for his mother but is played by the kind of child actor who gives you cavities. Most of the funny and insightful stuff falls to actors like Christopher Meloni T.R. Knight Hamish Linklater Max Gail and even Tudyk. Ford meanwhile turns jowly and growly to play Rickey. He doesnt have the suffocating hardship of upholding a legacy because Helgeland has given him all the self-congratulatory stuff to play. Ford can get high and mighty with all the grandstanding he gets to do because Rickey here is right. Hes shamelessly entertaining in chewing everybody out and cheering everybody up. But by lifting up Ford and Rickey the movie makes Robinson beside the point. Its possible that Helgeland is thinking past the matter of racism altogether. A lot of 42 feels like an allegory for how things might go for that first openly gay guy in a major league locker room -- all the awkwardness about showering together and sharing rooms the complaints about not wanting to play with someone whos deemed different the way that after a season of prolonged exposure everyones tune changes and the outcast is embraced. But whether Helgeland is thinking about Jackie Robinson or his to-be-determined gay counterpart 42 ultimately doesnt feel like a sports drama as much as it does an epic commencement speech. One reason to love Danny Boyle is that well never have to put up with a Jackie Robinson movie from him. Or if it comes to that hell find an imaginative reason to do it. Last summer he had James Bond throw Queen Elizabeth out of a helicopter to open the Olympics. He gets off on his irreverence. Trance is high-order film noir nonsense that takes Boyle back to the thrillers he made at the start of his career with John Hodge (he wrote Trance too) like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting that were preoccupied with the grimy corners of the psyche. Boyles no longer a grimy filmmaker. He likes sleek icy images that seem launched from cannons and slingshots or pushed through syringes. Trance concerns an auction-house art heist that goes south when the jobs inside man an auctioneer named Simon (James McAvoy) takes a shot to the head that erases his memory of where he put the Goya painting he helped steal. The ringleader is a guy named Franck (Vincent Cassel) one of those elegant thugs who surrounds himself with a trio of goons that do the bone-breaking while he sips cognac or whatever. When its clear that Simon suffers from honest-to-goodness amnesia Franck lets him select a hypnotist to help him retrieve the memory. You suspect the movies up to no good because Rosario Dawson plays the shrink Simon picks. Theres no reason to ask us to believe Dawson as a medical professional unless she can turn that belief on its head. Eventually this woman talks her way into Francks criminal circle. She argues that Simon doesnt feel safe remembering where hes put the painting because he knows Franck and his friends will just kill him when he does. What ensues is group hypnosis some sex and two or three changeups that dont twist the plot so much as reroute and rewire the movie. This is Boyles first movie set entirely in London since 2003s 28 Days Later ...  and his affinity for affixing his camera to everything speaks to the citys reliance on closed-circuit surveillance. Hes working with the editor Jon Harris and his usual cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and they give the movie the exhilarating attention-deficit disorientation that Boyle has turned into a legible cinematic language. Symmetrical reflections in glass that turn into a living Rorschach a hypnosis head trip that requires use of an iPad to extend the trip the vaginal lattice of a highway overpass at night His eye is manic without ever descending into madness. Besides the script which Hodge wrote with the science fiction TV writer Joe Ahearne goes crazy enough. At some point you dont know whom to trust or whats real or why anybody is doing what theyre doing but McAvoy Dawson and Cassel work well together. Dawson is required to put her nude body to incoherent if not gratuitous use but shes also perfectly plausible when discussing the rare psychological state of extreme suggestibility. Even after the movie has gone off the deep end and into a moral pit youre not sure whether it makes any sense. By then Boyle has fried enough of our senses that Simons extreme suggestibility is contagious.

Well I can tell you that its fluid and kinetic and stylish and a treat to look at. (It is as noted a Danny Boyle film.) I can tell you that after a sharp but relatively conventional start it evolves into a whacked-out gonzo over-the-top fever dream. What I cant tell you alas is what its my primary job to tell you namely whether or not the movies any damn good. Related Story The Real Story of Baseballs Integration That You Wont See in 42 For what its worth I found Trance to be a gas a loose loopy and giddily diverting series of narrative ambushes and false flags. But I can easily envision another me just like me in virtually every other respect who hated the movie who found it sloppy and random and altogether too pleased with its own undeniably limited virtues. So heres the deal Ill describe the film as best I can without disclosing the repeated curveballs that are both its strength and its weakness. But Im preemptively indemnifying myself against any complaints that I either a) recommended a movie outing that ended in disappointment or frustration; or b) failed to laud adequately a work of cinematic genius. Im sorry but its just that kind of film one that will inevitably divide audiences along fault lines that are hard to predict.The movie starts with a smooth clever voiceover by James McAvoy--one good enough that it recalls both fellow Scotsman Ewan McGregors brilliant introduction to Boyles Trainspotting and also the compelling life-of-crime advice offered by not-yet-mega-star Daniel Craig in the opening of Layer Cake. McAvoy plays Simon a mid-level functionary at an auction house that specializes in putting prices on priceless works of art. Describing The Storm on the Sea of Galilee a Rembrandt in which the artist is believed to have painted his own likeness Simon explains ""You cant see him though because it was stolen. Lots of paintings are stolen."" He then proceeds to recount the mechanics of such thefts how easy they were in the days when you could saunter in with a few hard men and take whatever you liked and how hard theyve become in the years since with paramilitary Ukrainian guards waiting in a van outside the auction house and fast-drop chutes ready to spirit threatened artworks back to the safety of the underground vault.Nonetheless there is of course a robbery--of Goyas Witches in the Air--and Simon is of course the inside man. But when the ringleader of the gang Franck (Vincent Cassel) delivers him an all-too-authentic blow to the head during the course of the heist he knocks out all memory of where Simon has stashed the stolen artwork. When torture fails to beget remembrance Franck sends Simon to a hypnotherapist named Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) to crack the subconscious safe in which the paintings location is locked away. Elizabeth--not remotely lamb-like--insinuates herself into Simons head and into the gang; hypnotic trance and reality become harder and harder to distinguish between; and things generally start getting Boyle-ishly trippy.A few of the storys twists are almost laughably contrived and based on a single viewing I cant say whether all the pieces actually fit together. (I rather doubt it.) But for those willing to overlook such niceties it is a reckless ride.The journey into delirium is gradual--also unexpectedly sexual and violent--and it wont be for everyone. A few of the storys twists are almost laughably contrived and based on a single viewing I cant say for certain whether all the pieces actually fit together. (I rather doubt it.) But for those willing to overlook such niceties it is a reckless woozy ride. McAvoy and Cassel are both quite good the score (by Rick Smith of the band Underworld) throbs appropriately and Dawson--well at times the movie seems primarily constructed as a monument to her empyrean allure.In the end Trance is to Danny Boyle more or less as Side Effects was to Steven Soderbergh an arty spin on a trashy B-movie engineered to showcase the directors particular gifts. (In the case of Soderbergh his meticulousness; in Boyles his pedal-to-the-floor exuberance.) But while I had no absolutely compunction about recommending Side Effects I am of decidedly mixed minds regarding Trance. You may love it. You may hate it. The appropriate response if you can manage it might be to do both at once.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 12 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 12 2013 1003AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Danny Boyle Written by Joe Ahearne John Hodge Starring James McAvoy Vincent Cassel Rosario Dawson Classification 18A Genre drama Year 2013 Country Britain Language English Great cast stylish direction and a plot thats a riddle wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a what-the-hells-going-on muddle. How much that eventual muddle will mar your enjoyment of Trance will no doubt vary wildly from viewer to viewer. After all as every hypnotist knows some of us are a lot more suggestible than others. Screen grab from an online trailer for the film Trance Movies Trance The official trailer Fresh off his stint stealing hearts in the costumed ceremonies of the London Olympics director Danny Boyle opens here with another flashy heist A crowded auction house Goyas Witches in the Air gavelled down at PS27.5-million the artful thieves led by Franck barge in tossing tear-gas canisters Simon their inside man whisks the Goya from the easel the elaborate theft goes off like clockwork until it doesnt. The gang escapes although without the prize. For his part Simon suffers a knock to the head and awakens next morning in the hospital. Hes got the painting but something else too a Memento-like case of amnesia bad enough that the guy cant remember where the Goya is stashed.All that and the opening credits have yet to roll. When they do the thieves have already fallen out and perhaps having seen too many movies to fall for that amnesia excuse Franck (Vincent Cassel) has Simon (James McAvoy) on his personal torture rack. However post pummelling he grows convinced that Simons affliction is genuine and that professional help is called for. Enter the hypnotist the beautiful Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson) who bored by a client list that tilts heavily toward the overweight and the nicotine-addicted eagerly takes the case. In fact right quick she has figured out Simons larcenous identity along with his connection to the gang.What follows is a weird yet intriguing menage a trois. The fetching hypnotist the conniving auctioneer the charismatic gangster - turns out the three are connected in surprising ways. Since the films enigma lies in figuring out the exact nature of those connections to divulge more of the plot would be to spoil the fun of the puzzle and later the frustration at the muddle it becomes. In each case were definitely kept guessing - the story draws us in even through the murk.But the least of the movies appeal is the hypnosis itself the repeated sessions where Simon gets put under to retrieve his lost memories and where Boyle trying to dramatize the trances gets seriously stylish. He has always been fond of blending surreal fantasy with harsh fact. Sometimes they cohere beautifully (Trainspotting); other times they dont (127 Hours); here they add up to a wealth of style that only seems to underscore the dearth of content. These trance sequences are meant to weave a potent spell but despite their good looks they play like fragile bubbles just a finger snap away from disappearing.Much better are the actors particularly when freed from their mental prison and let out into into the London fog. Like the puzzle plot McAvoy has us guessing too - one moment a sensitive connoisseur the next a gleeful nutcase. Individually Dawson and Cassel each generate plenty of screen heat but together in that one bedroom scene their chemistry is downright explosive so much so that it seems we have strayed into a whole different movie and dearly want to stay there.No such luck. Its soon back to the hypnotists couch and to the cluttered ending where alas yet another movie pops up - damned if the overwrought climax isnt the stuff of a wannabe blockbuster. Then again some will surely bark their wholehearted approval of Trance especially since as it takes pains to point out ""5 per cent of the population is extremely suggestible."" The other 95 will just have to fake it.

Starring James McAvoy Rosario Dawson Vincent Cassel Director Danny Boyle Running time 204 Release Opened Apr 12 2013  Editorial Review A trippy take on the art heistBy Michael OSullivanFriday April 12 2013Danny Boyle plays fast and loose with reality in ""Trance"" a lurid propulsive twisty and trippy thriller about an amnesiac man who gets hypnotized in order to remember where he has hidden a stolen multimillion-dollar painting. Youre never quite sure whether what youre seeing is actually happening or merely the result of a characters post-hypnotic suggestion. Like ""Inception"" a film with which it bears obvious similarities its premised on the minds ability to fool itself. Thats one of the films pleasures. Three others are the main cast. James McAvoy plays Simon an employee of an art auction house who after a blow to the head forgets what he has done with a canvas hes helping a gang of criminals steal. Vincent Cassel plays Franck the suave yet ruthless mobster who will stop at nothing to get the painting. And Rosario Dawson plays Elizabeth the opportunistic hypnotherapist Franck hires to unlock Simons unconscious. Thats after Francks unsuccessful attempt to jog Simons memory by having his goons pull out Simons fingernails. Yes ""Trance"" is surprisingly even unnecessarily violent as it escalates toward a grisly climax. Theres also a scene of startlingly graphic nudity. That one at least is essential seeing as Simons knowledge of the fine points of er female grooming trends in art history is a key plot point. Lets just say that you will come out of this movie knowing nearly as much about the topography of Dawsons naked body as her ex-boyfriend Boyle probably does. Its hot but also a little voyeuristic. Whats nicest about McAvoy Cassel and Dawson is that none of them plays a wholly sympathetic -- or wholly unsympathetic -- character. Of the three McAvoy probably has to stretch the most playing a gambling addict with a history of drug use (and other misbehaviors it would not be nice to reveal for spoiler reasons). That shows as he never looks totally comfortable here. Cassel however was born to play sexy debonair bad guys. Dawson surprises in her role which allows Elizabeth to have the upper hand for much of the film as a woman who can make men do what she wants with the snap of her fingers. One scene features Elizabeth attempting to put Franck and his gang (Danny Sapani Matt Cross and Wahab Sheikh) under hypnosis to intriguing effect. The movies greatest kicks come from watching the three protagonists vie to maintain their leverage -- through sex hypnosis deception willpower and inevitably the barrel of a gun. There are however some problems. Chief among them is the notion that the purloined painting (Francisco de Goyas 1797-1798 ""Witches in the Air"") would be worth to a thief anything close to what it might fetch at open auction. You cant just fence such a famous artwork the way you would stolen silverware. Its too recognizable. Another problem is the way Boyle working from a screenplay by Joe Ahearne and John Hodge unpacks the films densely interlocking twists and turns of plot. Theres a little too much happening in the films violent frenetic conclusion which involves the retrieval of fractured memories the confession of betrayals and so many narrative loops within loops that the films big reveals never make perfect deeply satisfying sense. Maybe its not supposed to. I came away wondering whether the headache I left the theater with was such a bad -- or even unintentional -- thing after all. In the end Simon isnt the only one who gets bashed on the head by ""Trance."" Contains violence and torture obscenity sex and nudity.

"Trance (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Trance (R) Director Danny Boyles energetic preposterous thriller is a dazzling mess. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/11/2013 Editor rating 2 Trance director Danny Boyles attempt to step into Christopher Nolan-styled ""Whoa"" territory plays like a mix tape of his previous films. Characters break the fourth wall and address the audience directly as in Trainspotting. The films visual style is sleek and shiny and energetic as in Slumdog Millionaire. Good guys and bad guys keep switching hats until you dont know whom to trust as in Shallow Grave. And in its final third Trance collapses into a pile of preposterous silliness like Sunshine did. The movie reunites Boyle with former frequent collaborator John Hodge who wrote The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary for him among others. You would think it had taken something wonderful to reunite the pair but no Trance feels like a movie that exists only because the Oscar-winning Boyle had the clout to make it on a modest budget. Its a self-indulgent bauble and when you play it back in your head the story makes no sense. At least its never boring. James McAvoy stars as Simon an auctioneer at a fine art museum who collaborates with a gang of thieves (led by Vincent Cassel) to steal a Goya painting being auctioned. But during the heist Simon bumps his head and blacks out. When he wakes up he cant remember what happened -- and cant explain why the briefcase that was supposed to contain the painting is empty. This does not sit well with his criminal pals who force him to see a renowned hypnotist Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson) to help him remember where the artwork went. The plot of Trance is purposely convoluted -- youre supposed to get more and more confused as the story unfolds not always sure if what youre watching is a dream. But unlike say Inception which expertly played with levels of consciousness and reality Trance is nearly impossible to keep up with. Everything in the movie is essentially a build-up to a big reveal so very little that happens matters. Fortunately theres Dawson. From the moment we meet her we know theres something up with Elizabeth. But whose side is she on and what does she really want? The actress whose looks have rarely been more seductive and who speaks in a measured manner that makes you want to lean closer is the films secret weapon. Boyles camera dips and swirls with bursts of violence and ghastly sights (including one the films best that was ruined in the trailer). But all the action slick and professional as it is cant compete with Dawsons performance. She exudes a kind of calm aura a seductive confidence and an inviting take-my-hand quality that practically puts you in the eponymous trance. Shes never been better Too bad shes not good enough from keeping this nutty movie from exploding into shards of colorful nonsense.

RELATED NEWS Interview James McAvoy By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Apr 11 2013 1015 AM If youre going to champion style over substance youll want Danny Boyle providing the style. He does so and then some in ""Trance"" a twisty tale of art theft hypnosis and the struggle to figure out whats real and whats not. All of which makes it sound like a heftier movie than it really is. Its great fun to look at to follow and guess whats going on both in the movie and in the characters lives and heads. Ultimately however the story doesnt support all of the masterful tricks Boyle has at his disposal and uses so well mostly because theyre well tricks. But youre not likely to complain certainly not in the moment. The film begins with Simon (James McAvoy) who works in an auction house explaining to the camera and presumably to us how to prevent the theft of astronomically expensive works of art. Then he helps steal a Goya. (This isnt a spoiler; the whole film is built around the theft.) Simon is in cahoots it turns out with a gangster named Franck (Vincent Cassel) because Simon has some hefty gambling debts. But that bit of story exists to justify the action and to establish Simons desperation. Franck wants the Goya but there is a problem During the course of the robbery Simon suffers a blow to the head and now he cant remember where he stashed the painting. A little garden-variety torture doesnt help jog his memory so Franck agrees to send Simon to a hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson). Its dicey because after all Simon cant just wander in and say he doesnt remember where he put the painting he stole. So he has to trick Elizabeth. But shes not so easily fooled and may have a few tricks of her own. Letting Boyle working from a script by Joe Ahearne and John Hodge loose in the world of art is a great idea. ""Trance"" is beautiful to look at even when we dont know whether what were seeing is really happening or just going on in a characters head. Boyles vision of what a scene should look like whether its a Mumbai train station in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" or a zombie-ravaged Britain in ""28 Days Later"" has always been flawless. Dipping in and out of reality also requires work on the part of the actors all of whom are up to the task. McAvoy makes Simons frustration first at losing his memory and then at trying to figure out whats going on around him seem genuine. Cassel is always a dependably menacing presence; hes the thinking persons bad guy. The film ends up hinging on Dawsons performance though and shes rarely been better. Its a great role full of edge and angles. Too rarely do women get a chance to play characters like this ones who hold their own with strong male characters. And in a crime thriller? Rarer still. But the twists for all their entertainment value eventually leave Simon hanging; the film would be better served if the characters could keep pace with the sharp turns in the story. So yes in the end ""Trance"" is pretty manipulative. But again with Boyle behind the camera its a more satisfying experience than it might have been. If were going to be manipulated it might as well be by a master. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"So where exactly did he put that Goya? - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate So where exactly did he put that Goya? Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 04.11.13 | 1148 AM Some people cant stand Danny Boyles approach to filmmaking. All that hyperactive cutting and color-saturated imagery the in-your-face camera angles yoked to tempos fueled by breakneck music -- at times Boyle can seem more like a DJ than a director. But because his style is generally wedded to strong story lines -- in movies like ""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""127 Hours"" ""28 Days Later"" and ""Trainspotting"" -- a lot of audiences critics and Oscar voters follow him willingly. With ""Trance"" story becomes just another element in Boyles commercial pop-Cubism and the results are nearly fatal. The title couldnt be more misleading since the movies the opposite of dozy and quiescent -- its what you might get if a post-doctoral student put a heist movie in a Cuisinart. James McAvoy plays our narrator Simon a London auction-house employee who gets conked on the head during a brazen mid-bid robbery by a gang of thieves. He wakes up in the hospital minus a chunk of his memory. Simon remembers that he was in on the job but he cant remember where he put the booty Goyas spectral 1798 painting ""Witches in the Air."" Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Unfortunately for him the gangs leader Franck is played by Vincent Cassell (""Irreversible"" ""Oceans Twelve"") who most audiences understand by now is capable of anything in the interests of persuasion starting with fingernail removal and proceeding from there. If Franck could rip the memory from Simons battered brain he would. But he cant. So he hires a hypnotherapist. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Her name is Elizabeth and shes played by Rosario Dawson with a professionalism that becomes increasingly shredded over the course of the plot. I confess it The presence of Dawson in any movie tends to dismantle this reviewers critical faculties so its a mark of how spectacularly bonkers ""Trance"" gets that that I feel like I deserve a long vacation from her and everyone else involved. The gangster wants Simon to wear a wire in his sessions the faster to get the goods but Elizabeth tumbles to the trick and agrees to continue only if shell get a cut. (Trust me I havent spoiled a tenth of what the movie has up its overstuffed sleeve.) ""Trance"" turns into a feverish three-handed poker game of greed and desire with Simon and Franck crushing on Elizabeth Elizabeth throwing down new cards and everyone bluffing everyone else. The other gang members are there for local color and the occasional bullet in the crotch. The trick with tricky movies lies in keeping the audience on a tightrope of pleasure and belief faking us out with each new reveal while talking us into renewing our trust again and again. If we get to the end and feel both exhausted and played fair by alls well. ""Trance"" by contrast piles on one surprise after another until it goes far past fair and close to Dada. Coincidences and connections are introduced until its clear the filmmakers are interested only in what they can get away with. Our allegiances are bounced back and forth like badminton birdies. We learn more about Elizabeths personal grooming habits than youd expect from a mainstream film. All of this gamesmanship can be great fun when done in the right spirit and Boyle is nothing if not a spirited director. ""Trance"" is lunatic but undeniably entertaining for much of its running time. At a certain point though -- say after the third or fourth narrative switchback -- our emotional involvement is down to nil. Only the cheerfully sadistic Franck has any sympathy by the end. He may be a psychopath but at least hes reasonable. The movies baroque diamond-hard and beautiful to look at shot to a gleaming fare-thee-well by Boyles usual coconspirator Anthony Dod Mantle. ""Trance"" is mesmerizing nonsense but it is in the end nonsense a succession of fake-outs that leaves an audience feeling merely burned. Its one thing to employ an unreliable narrator.

Photo Credit Fox Searchlight Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A crooked art dealer in league with a criminal ring forgets where he left the stolen masterpiece. Rated R (violence vulgarity gore sexual content adult content nudity) BOTTOM LINE Some will feel cheated if not strangled by the knotty plotline but director Danny Boyle revels in style tension and Rosario Dawsons face. Could be worse. CAST James McAvoy Vincent Cassel Rosario Dawson LENGTH 141 Like his contemporaries Ang Lee and Michael Winterbottom -- and unlike a lot of directors -- Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""127 Hours"") never makes the same movie twice. He also seems intent like Lee to eventually make a movie in every conceivable genre -- or in the case of ""Trance"" several at once. Starring James McAvoy as a London auction-house employee who forgets the whereabouts of the painting he helped heist Boyles latest story employs perhaps one -- or two or three -- too many twists which may leave viewers with the sense that theres a plot party going on to which they may have not been invited. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? For much of the film however Boyles innate flair as a dramatist and conjurer keeps one clamped to the armrests. (He has said that much of what is in ""Trance"" consists of what he had to leave out of the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.) Simon (McAvoy) suffers a blow to the head during the robbery of the London auction house where hes employed and forgets where he left the Goya (an intimation of things to come). Finding that torture and threats arent helping jog Simons memory the menacing gangster Franck (Vincent Cassel) suggests that Simon see a psychotherapist who will help recover the information. Its an absurd idea of course but it does get Rosario Dawson into the movie which is an excellent idea. Even as the rest of the film takes flight from sense and sanity Dawsons slightly feral Elizabeth keeps matters rooted in the sexy supple and enjoyably craven. Obviously ""Trance"" does not achieve success on every level. But movies that do often lack the energy and deliciousness that Boyle delivers here.

Danny Boyle turns an art-theft caper into a dizzying trip to dreamland.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune April 12 2013 -- 509pm Video (0740)  Neal Justin and Colin Covert delve into Danny Boyles ""Trance"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Trance"" superficially seems like a regulation crime thriller. The theft of a precious Goya painting from a London auction house sets off a lethal game of hide-and-seek. The early scenes with our chummy narrator Simon (James McAvoy) a junior executive whos clubbed in the head during the theft suggest thats where things are going. But its all misdirection. ""Trance"" is not a simple smash-and-grab yarn but an abstract psychological thriller. Moviegoers who expect a rote movie from British director Danny Boyle (""28 Days Later"" ""Slumdog Millionaire"") will have the rug yanked from under them. Boyle is telling us a story of a perfect crime gone awry. But like his protagonist hes really shifty about it. ""Trance"" is an artful experiment in refined sadism and mind control. Its whiplash shifts of perspective and chronology are brought off with breathtaking skill. Even as were aware of being manipulated we savor the films expert control. When Simon awakes in a hospital several weeks after his attack the thieves leader Franck (hawk-faced Vincent Cassel) swoops down on him. Only Simon knows where the Goya has landed and Simon claims amnesia. When violent efforts fail to jog Simons memory Francks gang takes a different approach. Keeping Simon in their cross-hairs they send him to Elizabeth (a never-more-assured Rosario Dawson) an eminent hypnotherapist to uncover the buried secret. The film enters Simons subconscious and our own grip on reality comes unhinged. ""Trance"" proceeds in leaps loops and layers. No character is completely innocent or entirely trustworthy. And the angles they use to betray one another are kids stuff next to the shell game Boyle plays with us the viewers. The story slides in disorienting directions. Elizabeth proves to be formidably resourceful Franck discloses a surprising romantic streak and Simon reveals a background less than simon pure. With visual vitality that borders on sensory overload and seemingly endless tricks up his sleeve Boyle teleports us into dream states suppressed memories flashbacks and alternate viewpoints. You cant guess whats coming next. You cant even be certain about whats happening in the moment. Those who prefer their movies literal and linear will groan at the effort needed to hold onto this gorgeous whirligig. The appeal of adventure movies is rooting for a lead character to overcome the threats that encircle him. ""Trance"" takes its sweet time deciding who that triumphant figure will be. It requires us to switch allegiance a couple of times too many. But Id always recommend a movie that kidnaps me to dreamland over one that puts me to sleep.

"Danny Boyles Trance fails to bewitch review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDanny Boyles Trance fails to bewitch reviewDanny Boyle seems to have had a blast making his mind-tripping thriller Trance. Its a pity he makes it so difficult to share in his joy.Rosario Dawson makes a fine femme fatale but its hard to care about her or the other characters in Trance.  (Susie Allnutt / Fox Searchlight)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 11 2013TranceStarring James McAvoy Rosario Dawson and Vincent Cassel. Directed by Danny Boyle. 101 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. 18ADanny Boyle seems to have had a blast making Trance. Its a pity he makes it so difficult to share in his joy.The genre-hopping British filmmaker describes this serpentine psycho-thriller as a form of personal therapy something he did to relieve stress while also directing last summers Olympics opening ceremony.Article Continued BelowHe stopped and started the movie to accommodate his Olympic priorities which may account for why it has such a patchwork feel to it. More difficult is the lack of feeling it summons for the three principal characters played by James McAvoy Rosario Dawson and Vincent Cassel. Trance begins as a heist picture one in which Goyas fearsome masterpiece Witches in the Air presents itself as an object to contemplate and to covet at a London auction house. The paintings theme an unsuspecting traveler consumed by witches is actually more interesting than the filthy lucre part.But it does sell for a cool 42 million under the watch of auction official Simon (McAvoy) who has already told us via voiceover narration how easy it used to be for hoods to snatch paintings and how tough it is today thanks to elaborate new security measures.This doesnt stop determined criminals however and one presents himself in the person of crooked nightclub kingpin Franck (Cassel) who figures hes pulled off the perfect crime -- until suddenly he hasnt.The Goya slips from Francks fingers and he blames Simon but a knock on the head removes all memories the auctioneer has of what just went down. If Simon knows what happened to the painting its no longer top of mind. Enter hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Dawson) whom Franck resorts to in desperation after he and his thugs fail to crack Simons nut through torture (didnt these guys see Zero Dark Thirty?). The hope is that Elizabeth by putting Simon into a trance state will be able to unblock his memory.At this point you almost want to break into applause for the brazen way Boyle and screenwriters Joe Ahearne and John Hodge employ the old amnesia plot device which is more appropriate to comedy than drama. Even one of Francks thugs moans ""Everyone knows that amnesia is bollocks""It may well be but for a while in Trance its a reasonably effective device pushed along by the films danceable soundtrack (masterminded by Underworlds Rick Smith a Boyle regular). The picture looks great too its bright colours seeming to have melted off an impressionists canvas recalling the palette cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle brought to Boyles Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours.The problem with Trance is that Boyle and his writers want to mess with more than just Simons brain. The story becomes twisted and unreliable to the point of being downright silly as motivations shift and finding the missing Goya starts to seem like the furthest thing from everybodys mind.Narrative clarity isnt the issue; lack of character empathy is. We are given no compelling reason to care for these people even though McAvoy and Cassel both deliver competent performances and Dawson goes one further approximating a femme of noir intrigue.By the time the three leads start doffing their clothing in what seems like a bald attempt to restore the movies fading pulse viewers may find themselves something well short of bewitched or entranced.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Susie Allnutt This film image released by Fox Searchlight shows Rosario Dawson in a scene from ""Trance."" (AP Photo/Fox Searchlight Susie Allnutt) Movies are an illusion. If theyre well-made we believe what we see; if theyre not we spend the rest of the day probing the holes in the plot. When filmmakers add the additional deception of an alternate reality they engage us in solving a puzzle but the after-movie hangover can make us feel duped.Case in point ""Trance."" It was directed by Oscar winner Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") who confirms that he is incapable of making a bland movie but susceptible to picking a preposterous script.It starts with a bang as London auctioneer Simon (James McAvoy) is bludgeoned by a gang of sophisticated art thieves whove targeted a Goya painting worth 27 million pounds. But the clockwork caper busts a gear and the movie grinds to a prolonged halt. The four thugs led by Franck (Vincent Cassel) think that Simon stashed their loot and they strong-arm him to cough it up. But amnesiac Simon cant remember a thing. The solution? Franck sends Simon to a hypnotist Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson). She deduces that the patient who claims he lost his car keys is seeking something more valuable and she tells the gangsters who are eavesdropping on the session that she wants a piece of the action.Despite the neon sheen and techno soundtrack of a thriller ""Trance"" is essentially a talkfest. There are far too many scenes of the thugs sitting idly while Elizabeth hypnotizes Simon and Franck devolves from a fierce mastermind into an impatient sidekick. To add some visual distractions to the overly tricky script Boyle literalizes Elizabeths instructions to the slumbering Simon making him enact fantasy sequences in which he draws closer to the missing MacGuffin. But as in Christopher Nolans ""Inception"" the wrinkles between reality and illusion soon become irritating. In the final minutes screenwriters Joe Ahearne and John Hodge resort to having one of the characters explain all the plot twists. Boyle tosses some red meat to the restless audience but the violent crescendo shatters the stupidity barrier.When we awaken from this ""Trance"" we wish we could have our amnesia back.What ""Trance""  Two stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 141  Content Sexuality nudity violence and strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Go"" Director Danny Boyle working from a screenplay by Joe Ahearne and John Hodge combines elements of the high-end heist thriller (the object of everyones affection is the Goya painting ""Witches in the Air"") and a bloody sexy revenge bash. It begins sanely enough. Simon played by James ""Can You Ever Trust Me Really?"" McAvoy is an auction house employee explaining to us how things work in an emergency situation -- a theft for example.In the first of a million or so flashbacks Boyle illustrates what went down when Simon teamed up with a gang of thieves to steal the Goya. Simons conked on the head hard enough to suffer amnesia which is inconvenient since he no longer recalls where he hid the multimillion-dollar canvas. Perhaps the alluring hypnotherapist played by Rosario Dawson can shake loose Simons memories. Maybe the gang leader portrayed by that lean mean menace machine Vincent Cassel will be able to track the narrative better than the rest of us.Thats just the first 20 minutes or so before the serious spoilers start spinning around. Reteaming with his ""Slumdog Millionaire"" cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle Boyle has crafted a deeply saturated nut case of a movie each interior dominated by great pools of neon red or royal blue no less than ""Slumdog"" wallowed in its nearly abstract use of color. For a while ""Trance"" had me guessing and more or less hooked. Then the violence motivations double-crosses and fantasy/reality tangles became tedious.

It starts out as a heist picture then morphs into a love story a hate story a mad scientist movie an existential is-it-real-or-is-it-a-dream fantasia - you name it. Its like watching a Hitchcock movie thats been run at top speed through a cineastes render. The effect for me was more alienating than enjoyable. James McAvoys Simon has lifted a valuable Goya painting from his posh London auction house employer. Vincent Cassels Frank is the hoodlum boss he betrayed in the heist and Rosario Dawsons Elizabeth is the hypnotherapist whos supposed to retrieve the location of the stashed canvas from Simons memory. Youre never quite sure at least until the end who the films central player is. Boyle loads his movie with so many snazzy effects that we lose sight of what it all means - if anything. His showoffiness confuses. Thrillers should be a lot more fun to piece together than this. Grade B- (Rated R for sexual content graphic nudity violence some grisly images and language.)

Night Shyamalan but if plot twists and shocking reversals and surprise reveals have a bad name right now at the movies the man behind ""The Village"" and ""The Happening"" should shoulder at least some of the responsibility. As if to vindicate and justify the pleasure and power of a good twist here comes Danny Boyles ""Trance"" a thoroughly pleasurable movie of unexpected revelations and witty diversions that easily ranks among the best films of this still-young year. I cant remember the last time I had this much fun having the rug pulled out from under me. The nature and specifics of when and how the film duped me will not be revealed here; suffice it to say that what starts out as an intricate art-theft caper then turns into an amnesia thriller before heading out into unpredictable territory. Auction house employee Simon (James McAvoy) narrates the films pre-credits prologue walking us through the drill of whats supposed to happen when burglars show up; he takes the canvas off the auctioneers easel walks it downstairs slips it into a case and then puts the case in a drop-box safe where no one can get it. Thats the drill mind you; when Franck (Vincent Cassel) and his men show up to commit a real crime things dont go exactly as planned. Without giving too much away Simon knows where the valuable Goya painting (""Flying Witches"") Franck wants is hidden but he cant remember because Franck hit him in the head during the robbery. After removing a few of Simons fingernails Franck believes that Simon genuinely has amnesia so off they go to hypnotherapist Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) to unlock the secrets hidden in Simons mind. And then ""Trance"" is really off to the races with double-crosses betrayals misdirects unexpected revelations and general pulse-racing. After the scoldy hectoring of ""Tyler Perrys Temptation Confessions of a Marriage Counselor"" its a real treat to see a good old-fashioned R-rated movie with sex and violence and nudity that all feels relevant to the plot. And while the brilliantly labyrinthine script by Joe Ahearne and John Hodge might have been just a clever B-movie in the hands of lesser filmmakers Boyle and his regular cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle jazz up the proceedings with a spectrum of color and light that dazzles without overwhelming the story. The three leads keep things hopping as well with McAvoy and Cassel consistently keeping us guessing about their characters intentions with no one turning out to be quite what we originally imagined. Its a real showcase for the always captivating Dawson; at first it seemed like she was tamping down her screen charisma too much in the service of playing a cool intelligent professional but it turns out her performance is as much about initially fooling the audience as she is the other characters. But thats all Ill say about it except that shes phenomenal. The less you know about ""Trance"" the better so go see it before anyone can spoil it for you. And then prepare to want to see it again armed with the knowledge of how things turn out and how the movie laid out all the clues in front of you the whole time. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT April 4 2013The visionary filmmakers psychological thriller weaves a too-complicated tapestry.James McAvoy stars in Trance the new film from director Danny Boyle which features dazzling style but not matching substance.(Photo Susie Allnutt Fox Searchlight Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review   1/2 out of fourStars James McAvoy Rosario Dawson Vincent Cassel Danny SapaniRated R; running time one hour 41 minutes; opens Friday nationwideIts worth succumbing to Trance because director Danny Boyle is one of the most visually inventive contemporary filmmakers.Even Boyles lesser films are captivating.But the dazzling style of this labyrinthine psychological thriller (   1/2 out of four; rated R; opening Friday nationwide) makes the viewer long for more substance.His last two films Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours were among his best gorgeous to look at and thoroughly absorbing. Trance falls on the other end of the spectrum. Though beguiling it doesnt have the dark wit of Boyles mysterious Shallow Grave or the pulsating suspense of Trainspotting his harrowing portrait of drug addiction.Instead it relies on curves tangles and pop psychology over a solid plot.STORY Danny Boyle A punk at heart an artist alwaysMORE No more Mr. Nice Guy post-OlympicsVIDEO Trance cast hypnotized by Danny BoyleREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYPart of the problem lies with the central character played by James McAvoy whose dimensions are left rather blank -- until close to the conclusion. By that time weve lost interest in him.Faring better is Rosario Dawson as a charismatic and mysterious hypnotherapist.Vincent Cassel takes on the kind of role weve seen him do well before a minor thug with major smolder potential.The story goes forward doubles back then switches to an even more abstract alternate reality. The convoluted plot is meant to be an intricate mind-bender that takes place largely within the unconscious of McAvoys character. But its often more of a mind-boggler. It seems to be aiming in the direction of Inception with a jot of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Oceans Eleven. But the story threads snarl.Unlike Inception which provided clever keys to figuring out its structure the dreamy unconscious in Trance seems haphazard frenetic and often meaningless.It is however consistently artful -- in at least a couple of ways.McAvoy plays Simon an art auctioneer. In an introductory voiceover Simon details the lengths to which employees at his London auction house are instructed to go to protect valuable paintings. The elaborate procedures explained at a breakneck pace powerfully grab our attention.Then events quickly become obfuscated as the tale becomes mired in deceptive complications.Cassel plays Franck the leader of a criminal gang involved in a heist to steal a Goya painting worth several million dollars. Franck roughs up Simon then takes him to see hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Dawson) to probe hidden memories. She could be a femme fatale manipulating his psyche or a compassionate professional. Or something else entirely. Simon could be a diligent auctioneer or something more sinister. To say more would be to give too much away. And to confuse.Confusion is a key component. Seeking to plumb the deepest recesses of Simons unconscious Elizabeth puts him in a series of trances. Imagination and memories are blurred.A shadowy color palette hypnotic electronic score and moody atmosphere all serve the film well along with Dawsons sultry performance. But McAvoy seems miscast. Simon has deep reserves of unpredictability and malice that McAvoy seems too likable to convey. Hes supposedly beset by a host of demons but his mild-mannered quality makes it hard to buy. In fact it would help to know more about all the characters back stories. Without that information the many U-turns the story takes are not as engrossing or suspenseful as they should be.The film descends into extreme and seemingly gratuitous violence rendering this hallucinatory heist thriller more off-putting than mesmerizing.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson) surprises Simon (James McEvoy) with her insight and offers him her help. 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/17fd6Nr,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/04/04/trance-review/2023657/,200,trance18,trance,usatoday

""Trance"" takes us out gets us drunk picks our pocket steals our car and leaves us barefoot in the middle of a country road. It seems like a fun date at first. But the lies it tells are huge the tricks arent fair and it only leaves us angry. The sort of thriller to make the tricky ""Side Effects"" feel like an Encyclopedia Brown story ""Trance"" begins with a London art robbery. The robbers ace in the hole? They have an inside man deep in debt to them whos been part of their plan all along. What no one planned for? That due to a traumatic bit of amnesia their man is going to forget exactly where he hid the painting. So its time to make him remember which leads everyone after an ugly and unsuccessful bit of torture to a both novel and very old-fashioned idea -- a hypnotherapist who will get our young antihero to find his lost memory and that purloined painting. This is a classic noir set-up from screenwriters Joe Ahearne and John Hodge and director Danny Boyle casts it well. In fact for its first half the movies really rather entertaining. The amnesiac is played by the personable James McAvoy -- so reminiscent of the Ewan McGregor who Boyle helped discover nearly 20 years ago. The suavely sinister Vincent Cassel is the chief thief all flaring nostrils and seductive eyes. The best character -- and casting -- comes with the hypnotherapist Dr. Elizabeth Lamb. In the either/or world of film noir females you might expect her to be a dupe or a devil; the name and setting suggests a peaches-and-cream Rosamund Pike type. Instead though Boyles cast Rosario Dawson who even in pencil skirts and pulled-back hair suggests a more complicated background. And whose character it becomes clear is rather complex too and perhaps not everything we think. But then about halfway in what had been a complicated story quickly becomes a simple muddle. And in the last quarter turns so far-fetched so confusing so gratuitously trashy -- both male and female genitals play a part -- it teeters into pure absurdity. Boyles work has always had a too-much-coffee energy a distaste for good taste and a wild willingness to mix and match styles within movies sometimes even within scenes; hes at his best when the material (drug addiction in ""Trainspotting"" the hikers hallucinations in ""127 Hours"") frees him from the surly bounds of logic. And for awhile thats what happens here as McAvoy goes down a rabbit hole lined with mirrors and the questions -- are memories ever really true? -- only reflect other questions. Flashbacks dreams fantasies all mix together in a fantastic tangle. But eventually a story like this needs to untangle them snap out of its own ""Trance"" and say This is what happened. Unlike the stage mind-reader a movie like this ends its act only by revealing its tricks. But when Boyle finally pulls aside the curtain to show what hes been up to all along we dont feel as if weve been fairly fooled. We feel as if weve been cheated -- both out of our money and worse out of an hour-and-a-half of our life.

"Danny Boyles Trance is no work of art - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Trance messy and deceptive is no work of artDirector Danny Boyles film about an art heist gone wrong is undone by its overuse of feints and dodges. James McAvoy Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson star.April 04 2013|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Dont look to be entranced by ""Trance."" It starts out like a house afire but by the time its over were the ones feeling burned. A slick heist tale with more twists than sense this is one movie that ends up outsmarting itself.Both the good and the bad things in ""Trance"" are traceable to director Danny Boyle who assembled the capable cast (James McAvoy Vincent Cassel Rosario Dawson) and has long wanted to film this project.As co-written by Joe Ahearne (whose 2001 British TV movie was the basis for this production) and Boyles ""Trainspotting"" collaborator John Hodge ""Trance"" certainly starts out promising brimming with the directors particular brand of manic energy.PHOTOS Scenes from the movie TranceBest known for his Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"" Boyle hates to do the same film twice. Given that he made something lively out of ""127 Hours"" the story of a hiker pinned in a Utah canyon by a falling rock for all that time Boyle certainly seemed suited to making a successful film about an art theft gone very very wrong.Introduced first with a glib monologue about stolen paintings is London auction house employee Simon (McAvoy) who talks about what it takes (muscle and nerve if you want to know) to pull off an art robbery.This is not some hypothetical treatise of course. In the blink of an eye Simon is involved in the theft of Goyas ""Witches in the Air"" (safely in Madrids Prado Museum in real life) just after it goes under the auction house hammer for more than 27 million. But in the fracas that ensues Simon sustains a blow to the head and when he awakes realizes to his chagrin that temporary amnesia has robbed him of all memory of where hes stashed the masterpiece.If this frustrates Simon it infuriates Franck (Cassel) the impatient head of the robbery gang who ransacks the poor mans car and apartment while hes hospitalized. Once Simon is released the crooks initially assume hes faking memory loss so they methodically pull out his fingernails an unpleasant hint of how off-putting ""Trance"" will turn out to be.PHOTOS Hollywood Backlot momentsStymied at every turn Franck insists that Simon go to a hypnotherapist. Dr. Elizabeth Lamb (Dawson) a cool American whose ultra-soothing voice is usually employed dealing with clients morbid obesity or panic attacks is selected at random.Elizabeth intuits that Simon is in some kind of trouble and that the stolen Goya is involved. Confronting her patient and Franck in what turns into more or less a three-character drama Elizabeth insists on getting a cut of the loot if she is going to help Simon recover his memory. ""We keep secrets from ourselves"" she says enigmatically ""and call it forgetting.""Its at this point that ""Trances"" plot really starts though you end up wishing it hadnt. For promising as that set-up may sound all it really delivers is frustration and dismay. How did a film that does so many things right end up in such a sorry state?For one thing ""Trance"" turns out to be all trickery all the time with nonstop feints and dodges nested one inside the other like Russian dolls. We all like twists in our thrillers but too much of a good thing is more than a clichA(c) here its a confusing reality.TIMELINE Violence in moviesCausing even more headaches (as if that were necessary) is that Simon can be put into hypnotism-induced trances quite easily. It turns out to be difficult telling if were watching one of his trances as opposed to the nominal reality of the rest of the movie. Yet because this film isnt made with the skill of Christopher Nolans similar ""Inception"" we dont really care to try.Because it is so slick ""Trance"" incorrectly assumes that its heedless lack of emotional connection doesnt really matter that its no problem if there isnt anybody you care to identify with or any outcome you want to see. This overall chill ensures that a kinky sexual plot element involving full frontal female nudity comes off as crassly exploitative a cold end in itself.Showoffy super pleased with itself too glib too often ""Trance"" squanders the energy created by Anthony Dod Mantles camera work Jon Harris editing and Rick Smiths music.Boyle sandwiched his stint on the feel-good London Olympics opening ceremony between his work on ""Trance"" and he said in a Sight amp; Sound interview that ""all the dark stuff that we couldnt put into the Olympics has ended up here."" Although that transference apparently made him feel better its going to make audiences feel a whole lot worse.kenneth.turanlatimes.com--------------------------------TranceMPAA rating R for sexual content graphic nudity violence some grisly images and languageRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE TIMELINE Violence in movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDanny Boyle in talks for Steve Jobs movie possibly with...April 21 2014With Danny Boyles Trance multiple layers of the surrealApril 5 2013Danny Boyle calls for a retake on TranceMarch 30 2013SXSW 2013 Danny Boyle and Rick Smith spin party into a...March 11 2013SXSW 2013 adds The East Danny Boyle Stevie Nicks docFebruary 13 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentSimonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-trance-review20130405,0,2259327.story",200,trance20,trance,latimes

An art auctioneer (James McAvoy) who has become mixed up with a group of criminals partners with a hypnotherapist (Rosario Dawson) in order to recover a lost painting. (Photo/Video Fox Searchlight Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated April 4 2013 813 p.m. ET One of the things we learn about hypnosis from ""Trance"" is that 5% of the population is extremely suggestible and will float in and out of a trance state. This suggests that at least 5% of the audience may be entranced by Danny Boyles new film. My response wasnt that intense but I floated in and out of states that included suspense surprise delight and shock all of them adding up to steady-state enjoyment. The precipitating event is an art heist gone awry. When thieves invade a London auction house to make off with a priceless Goya the canvas disappears in the ensuing chaos and the only one who can find it is James McAvoys Simon an auctioneer in league with the criminals. But a blow on the head has left Simon unable to remember where the rolled-up treasure may be. Thats a job for Rosario Dawsons Elizabeth a hypnotherapist hired by the gang leader to coax the crucial info from Simons cortex. Its also a pretext for the filmmaker to cast his own spell. It used to be said of certain actors that they could read the phone book and make it exciting. Printed directories are harder to come by these days but Mr. Boyle with his talent for visualization could turn any phone book into bedazzling images and he does better than that by making an open book of Simons brain. (His main accomplice in the visual realm as in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""127 Hours"" is the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle. The script was written by Joe Ahearne along with John Hodge the writer of Mr. Boyles first two films ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Trainspotting."") ""What we are"" Elizabeth explains ""is the sum of everything weve ever done been or felt."" Theres a sense of Simons sum having been thoroughly explored by the time the beauteous shrink has tweaked his synapses released his repressions and led him down the primrose paths of his recollections. (One of the routes he takes at her suggestion looks like an ecstatic version of Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg driving through the French countryside in ""Breathless."") Keeping all of this straight as we watch--whats conscious or un whats real or imagined whats true or false--is about as easy as keeping track of the levels of consciousness in Christopher Nolans ""Inception"" which ""Trance"" resembles quite a lot. But the movie rewards the effort and not just photographically though theres something to be said for simply sitting back and taking in the sights and colors. The best part of this stylish often violent production is the acting. Mr. McAvoy flourishes in a role of unusual range yet does so with his signature economy which makes his urgency all the more impressive when Simon comes close to losing his mind. Or losing his heart a risk thats not only a testament to the power of transference but a tribute to his therapists allure. Actresses rightly complain about all the passive women theyre forced to play. This isnt one of them to say the least. Elizabeths tactics range from intricately intellectual to scarily feral and its good to see the superb Ms. Dawson portraying someone worthy of her gifts. Vincent Cassel is impressive--and for him unusually expressive--as Franck the ruthless brain of the operation while Matt Cross and Wahab Sheikh are the brawn. Thats all they are--no characterization offered sensibly enough where none is needed. Watch a clip from the film ""The Company You Keep."" A thriller centered on a former Weather Underground activist (Robert Redford) who goes on the run from a journalist (Shia LaBeouf) who has discovered his identity. (Photo/Video Sony) The Company You Keep Youd expect ""The Company You Keep"" to be something special from the cast alone Robert Redford Shia LaBeouf Susan Sarandon Terrence Howard Anna Kendrick Stanley Tucci Brit Marling Nick Nolte Julie Christie Chris Cooper Brendan Gleeson Richard Jenkins and Sam Elliott. Mr. Redford who also directed is Jim Grant a lawyer and single father in upstate New York. Jim suddenly becomes a man on the run after Ben Shepard a young reporter played by Mr. LaBoeuf reveals him to be Nick Sloan a former left-wing radical and member of the Weather Underground whos been wanted for murder since the Vietnam War. The script adapted by Lem Dobbs from a novel by Neil Gordon conjures with potent issues--the line between antiwar protest and terrorism Nicks personal guilt or innocence (guess which if Mr. Redford is playing him) the obligations of journalism and of fatherhood. Yet the film is terribly clumsy a succession of didactic encounters with figures from Nicks past slightly enlivened by a contrived chase. ENLARGE Robert Redford Sony Pictures Classics The chase pits the reporters investigative skills against his quarrys survival skills and the journalism practiced is of the print variety. ""Youre pretty much what I expected"" Nick says with disgust when he first meets Ben whose brash ambition knows no bounds. In other words Ben is a descendant of--take your pick--the brash young reporter played almost 40 years ago by Dustin Hoffman in ""All the Presidents Men"" or the one played by Mr. Redford. This is intriguing even touching but its also revealing in ways that dont flatter the current production. ""All the Presidents Men"" was a genuinely thrilling political thriller whose explosive issues--Watergate the Vietnam War criminality in high places the fate of an American president--all unfolded in the present. ""The Company You Keep"" struggles to infuse the present with the drama of the chase and with a vestigial element of romance. Still the story is rooted in a political past that never comes to life and its structure is so cockeyed that we dont even get to see Nicks reaction to a climactic surprise that takes place off-screen. The film was shot by an excellent cinematographer Adriano Goldman though youd never know it from the lighting which is as flat as the writing. --J.M. ENLARGE Danny Lloyd in The Shining from Room 237. IFC Room 237 Stanley Kubrick was a genius thats for sure but a surpassingly eccentric one. ""Room 237"" which goes into national distribution this weekend may be the surpassingly eccentric--and enormously entertaining--film that Kubrick deserves. Rodney Aschers one-of-a-kind documentary consults five obsessive fans and/or film scholars on the hidden meanings of Kubricks ""The Shining."" What they come up with is fascinating and loony in equal measure. Did you see the 1980 film as a surreal horror story set in a haunted hotel? They see a movie about the Holocaust or the genocide of Native Americans. They find clear evidence that Kubrick planted subliminal cues about mythology and sexuality or that the cues were unintentional. They see numbers with cosmic significance (237 the hotel room is by extension 237000 the mean distance in miles between Earth and moon) as well as reason to believe that Kubrick had used ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" as a laboratory for producing footage that would fake Americas first moon landing even though the landing itself may have been real. And ""Room 237"" carries still another meaning. Its a celebration of impassioned film-going of watching a movie so closely that you see all the way into it. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""The Brass Teapot."" When a couple discovers that a brass teapot makes them money whenever they hurt themselves they must come to terms with how far they are willing to go. (Photo/Video Magnolia Pictures) ENLARGE Juno Temple Magnolia Pictures The Brass Teapot No pain no gain takes on new meaning in Ramaa Mosleys fable of an ancient teapot that dispenses money in proportion to the pain suffered--or inflicted--by its owners. Soon after the movie opens the pot comes into the possession of a 20-something couple who could certainly use financial aid. Alice (Juno Temple) and John (Michael Angarano) drive an old Pinto--what could be more ignominious in todays world?--and struggle with ends that refuse to meet. Ms. Mosley who directed from a screenplay by Tim Macy struggles to fill her debut feature with a slender notion but the premise defeats her even if the story operates at the outset on the pleasure principle. ""Are you a gift from the gods?"" John asks the pot early on. The answer would seem to be implicit in the couples good fortune which comes at a manageable price--a little masochism here a little sadism there a few bruises that will heal in time. And Alice and John are good company--especially Alice thanks to Ms. Temples buoyant humor and lovely poignancy. The problem comes when the couple gets greedy the gods grow angry and the tone turns dark. It doesnt stay dark but getting back to the brightness is a painful process. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE James McAvoy in The Last King of Scotland Fox Searchlight/Everett Collection The Last King of Scotland (2006) James McAvoy is the young Scottish physician Nicholas Garrigan in Kevin Macdonalds drama about the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. Mr. McAvoy was of necessity overshadowed by Forest Whitakers magnificent performance as the psychopathic ruler but he brings fluency and verve to the pivotal role of the doctor pressed uneasily into service as Amins personal adviser. Peter Morgan and Jeremy Brock adapted the screenplay from a novel by Giles Foden. The film shot partly in Uganda--the cinematographer was Anthony Dod Mantle--fairly vibrates with the colors sounds and textures of its African setting. ENLARGE Disturbia (2007) The most disturbious part of ""Disturbia"" is how engaging this teenage thriller manages to be even though its a shameless rip-off of Hitchcocks ""Rear Window."" Instead of Jimmy Stewart in a wheelchair we have Shia LaBeouf as Kale a troubled suburban teen under house arrest. Kales idle voyeurism leads him to believe a next-door neighbor may be a serial killer and he emerges as the Inspector Gadget of junior detectives. No gadgetry is needed though when Kale and Sarah Roemers Ashley the girl next door are together at quiet moments coming of age with timeless tenderness. ENLARGE Millions (2004) In Danny Boyles beguilingly lyrical comedy which was written by Frank Cottrell Boyce two young English brothers find a Nike bag full of money that seems to have fallen from the sky. The money is actually loot from a bank robbery and the kids have only a week to spend it before the United Kingdoms intended--though never consummated--switch from sterling to the euro. But ""Millions"" isnt one of those ""if I had a million"" fantasies. Its a religious fable at heart about a boy 7-year-old Damian (Alex Etel) whos pure of heart. --J.M. 13 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Botanists Sniff at Mystery of Smelly Plants Flowering Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Trance in which James McAvoy plays a stalwart London auction-house employee who helps sexy criminal Vincent Cassel steal an extremely valuable painting is a little of both. The picture begins as a neon-slick caper gets tripped up in the middle by its labyrinthine overly synthetic plot details and ends with a wrapup straight out of Crazytown. But when Trance is cooking it bubbles like a forbidden drug in the bowl of a spoon -- its all kinds of wrong and yet it feels seductively right. McAvoys Simon kicks off the proceedings by addressing the camera directly explaining the ins and outs the hows and whys of stealing art. He has an earnest scrubbed-clean look and his eyes are the same piercing blue found in Van Goghs Starry Night. Why would anyone trust this guy? How could anyone not trust him? But even though Cassels Franck and his gang of clever thugs have worked out the robbery in precise detail it still goes awry. Simon appears to have played his role in the heist well enough and Franck makes off with a package that ought to contain the painting in question. (Its Goyas Witches in the Air.) But when Franck gets back to his lair and unwraps the package that supposedly contains this precious work the frame is empty. Simon meanwhile has been knocked unconscious during the robbery; even after some time recuperating in the hospital he has no memory of what might have become of the painting. Franck puts the screws to him -- brace yourself for a little bit of nasty albeit off-camera fingernail business -- before enlisting a seductive hypnotist named Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson) to draw the hidden information from the deepest reaches of his cranium. Can she be trusted? More important can you trust your perception of anything? Heck no. In Trance written by Joe Ahearn and longtime Boyle collaborator John Hodge no one is who you think he is and no one does what youll think hell do. So what else is new? In the most basic terms this is one of those dime-a-dozen puzzle movies -- a la Inception or Source Code or Looper -- that pretend to be smart and tricky but really just send lots of sliced-and-diced information at you so rapidly that you think youre being dazzled. Its the kind of thing Boyle could do in his sleep -- and maybe he is asleep or at least just in a trance. i Dawsons Elizabeth is a hypotherapist trying to help the amnesiac Simon remember what happened to the Goya he was helping to steal. Fox Searchlight Pictures hide caption toggle caption Fox Searchlight Pictures Dawsons Elizabeth is a hypotherapist trying to help the amnesiac Simon remember what happened to the Goya he was helping to steal. Fox Searchlight Pictures But among all the swooshing camera moves and hairline cuts and hypersaturated pops of color there are actual actors giving wonderfully watchable performances. McAvoy plays Simon as a guy whos half lost lamb half conniving fox and even if you dont much care which side wins hes fun to watch. Yet Trance really belongs to Dawson and Cassel. When Dawsons Elizabeth steps onto the scene you may be instantly convinced -- without the aid of hypnosis even -- that shes surely the most effective hypnotist on the planet. Shes an erotic dangerous presence with a voice thats a silky purr soothing and persuasive -- if she blew in your ear youd follow her anywhere. And Cassel who has proven his genius at playing complex baddies (in Jean-Francois Richets Mesrine movies) and charming psychos (in David Cronenbergs A Dangerous Method) is a supremely romantic presence here. His Franck is no good mind you but theres a sea of longing behind the calculation in his eyes. Cassel carves warmth out of an ice block of coldness. Boyle may be sleepwalking -- speed-sleepwalking maybe -- through Trance. But hes awake and alive when it comes to knowing what his actors can do. Theyre the movies humming current delivering just the right jolts to make sure were fully awake.

"Trance | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; trance ) Trance (United Kingdom 2013) April 04 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Trance is a member of the movie category defined by the likes of Shutter Island and Inception - films in which the concept of ""reality"" is flexible and the reliability of the narrative is indeterminate. Even at the end once all has been explained and seemingly set right the viewer is left with a nagging uncertainty about whether the established storyline is the legitimate one. Theres something immensely appealing about this manner of storytelling in that it challenges the viewer to form his own interpretations about on-screen events. Unfortunately Trance obsesses a little too much with being clever and twisty. The characters become pawns to the plot their actions based not on some sort of internal personality consistency but on how they need to perform in order to advance the narrative. The movie is never boring or uninteresting but I viewed it from a detached perspective unable to become involved because I didnt really care about any of the three main characters. Trance gives every indication of being a high-energy heist movie before the bait-and-switch occurs. Simon (James McAvoy) a deputy art auctioneer is injured attempting to thwart the armed theft of a Goya painting. Despite being hailed by the media and his colleagues as a hero he was in fact the ""inside man"" for the job. However instead of the chief thief Franck (Vincent Cassel) getting away with the painting Simon hides it but a knock to the head results in him being unable to remember where he stashed it. When a gruesome regime of torture at the hands of Francks thugs fails to elicit a response Franck acknowledges that the amnesia may be real. The next step is to enlist the aid of a hypnotist Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) who seeks to coax a memory of the incident back into Simons conscious brain. But is she drawing out real recollections or implanting false ones? As viewers we begin to question everything were seeing recognizing that the reality of the films universe is no longer a constant. Calling Trance a Shutter Island or Inception wannabe is inaccurate. This is a remake of a 2001 British TV movie; as such it not only predates both movies but was also likely in the can before author Dennis Lehane began writing the novel upon which the Martin Scorsese movie was based. (The novel Shutter Island was published in 2003.) However ""first"" doesnt necessarily equate to ""best."" Shutter Island and Inception while using similar approaches to the fluidity of reality and the unreliability of the third-person storytelling method are more intricately constructed than Trance. Character development is the chief flaw. Although its possible to appreciate the twists and loops and switchbacks the storyline puts Simon Franck and Elizabeth through they never seem like more than chess pieces moved around on the board to satisfying some narrative necessity. Franck in particular acts in bizarre and contradictory ways. This big bad crook who has no problem ordering the mangling of Simons hands (and is almost certainly capable of much worse things) hardly blinks when Elizabeth negotiates her way into his gang. Admittedly some of the personality inconsistencies can be explained by the instability of whats on screen but not all of them. In the end Trance is satisfying as a puzzle to solve but not as a story to be immersed in. Theres also a problem with the decidedly anticlimactic ending. Trance leads us to believe theres going to be something truly mind-bending or at least mildly surprising but its all rather straightforward. I felt let down in the same way as with Total Recall (the Schwarzenegger one) another movie that plays with memories and reality. Director Danny Boyle one of todays most versatile working directors uses a fairly straightforward style to tell this story. There are few flourishes. The pace is frantic rarely pausing for exposition and the narrative drive keeps viewers involved even if they may be somewhat bewildered or disconnected from the characters. Boyle has no trouble seeming to wrap everything up into a neat tidy bow while still leaving a sliver of doubt about the outcome. James McAvoy does an adequate job as the hapless Simon but theres not a lot of meat on the bone for him to gnaw on. Vincent Cassel is surprisingly low-key as Franck. Cassel has played some truly badass characters in his career but he dials it down considerably for this role. The standout is Rosario Dawson whose portrayal of Elizabeth smolders. The actress once remarked that she had no qualms about screen nudity if the script required it and she is given ample opportunity to defend that comment. The MPAA has accorded her work in Trance with the odd descriptor ""graphic nudity"" - not something that bothers her or Boyle who has a long history of directing scenes featuring ""graphic nudity."" Trance is an intriguing movie and worth seeing for those who appreciate films that fuck with the viewers mind. Its not entirely successful in this goal however so a letdown at the end while not inevitable is possible. The movie has limited mainstream appeal and its lack of character definition left me feeling as if the glass was half-empty.

Id put his new one ""Trance"" a notch below them but only a notch. This exhilarating brain-twister is a nonstop visual aural and intellectual delight steeped in movie conventions and yet fizzing with freshness. Its what happens when film noir goes out to a rave. Dont learn too much about it before you see it. Ill limit myself to giving away only what happens in the opening minutes. Simon (James McAvoy) is a security guard at a London auction house that is selling a Goya painting for PS27 million (41 million) when an art thief named Franck (Vincent Cassel) bursts in and seizes the painting. Or so he thinks Actually the canvas has gone missing and only Simon knows where it is. Except Simon cant remember having sustained a head blow during the robbery that has left him with amnesia. Enter an expert hypnotist Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) who can unbury any memory. Though maybe not this one. The dazzling script by Joe Ahearne and Boyles frequent collaborator John Hodge has more surprises in its first 20 minutes than most films can manage in 100 but each sharp turn merely inspires Boyle to stomp harder on the pedal. Who will get the painting? Who will get the girl? Who will get half a skull blown off and just keep talking? ""Trance"" a title which refers to the hypnotic state several characters descend into as well as the dance music that urges the movie forward and the helpless awe in which Boyle held me throughout has a plot similar to that of Boyles sinister 1994 tale of a greed triangle ""Shallow Grave."" But this time Boyle projects it through an ""Inception""-style prism of subconscious fantasy. The Christopher Nolan film though was operatically ponderous brooding about its own genius to the point where the audience had to clear its throat and ask ""Remember us?"" ""Trance"" is pure entertainment no study guide required. Via the hypnotist various characters slip in and out of fantasyland and though I revile the way writers (particularly on TV dramas) use dream sequences to eat up a couple of minutes of screen time on a cheap shock that winds up being meaningless in ""Trance"" the characters learn essential truths by exploring their subconscious minds. Details (such as car keys) that seem meaningless keep coming back to play important roles and to link different levels of consciousness Boyle ingeniously uses the iPad in what I believe is a new role for it in movies one that a thousand other directors will imitate. Boyle makes everything seem as fresh as the iPad because his great subject is youth -- not as with Steven Spielberg childhood; the innocence of ""Millions"" Boyles 2004 attempt at a fairy tale didnt quite convince and he hasnt returned to the genre. (Boyles next film is called ""Porno."") A newspaper headline in ""Trance"" refers to Simon as the ""have-a-go"" hero of the art heist Thats Boyle perpetual chancer always having a go. Whats it like to get hooked on heroin? Steal the prettiest girl in India from gangsters? Hop into a gorge? Lets have a go. We dont learn a lot about Simon except that hes young but thats really all we need to know. Boyles all about the race to the next rush the completely unjustified confidence the addiction to crazy youth. Its an inexhaustible well and may Boyle never stop dunking his bucket in it. This is ecstatic cinema the brightest brassiest buzziest film of the year so far.

Area theaters. The trick in ""Trance"" is all in the telling. A frisky feisty heist flick with brains and charisma the movie may make a few errors but theyre forgotten in the blink of an eye thanks to all the twists turns and close shaves. Director Danny Boyle makes his movies spin on the rush of storytelling. In ""Shallow Grave"" ""Trainspotting"" ""The Beach"" ""28 Days Later"" ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""127 Hours"" its the illuminating bits of back story and memory -- often accompanied by incantatory musical scores -- that make those movies even the lesser ones feel rich. While ""Trance"" may not leave you spellbound its hard to get out of your head. James McAvoy is Simon a London high-art auctioneer whose outer calm conceals inner mania. A gambling addict who needs to pay off a huge debt Simon joins forces with a thug named Franck (Vincent Cassel) to rob a valuable painting by Goya. The hitch comes when Simon is conked on the head during the getaway and cant remember where he put the stolen goods. To recover the info in Simons head Franck sends him to a hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson). Using guided hypnosis Elizabeth digs into Simons subconscious to get at his repressed memories. Thats a messy place to be. It turns out Simon is harboring a few secrets including some Franck might want to know some Elizabeth may already know and a big one Simon isnt even aware of. Thats a succinct way of summarizing the movies many quirks which include a visual palette combining Hitchcockian elegance with modernist flair an ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""-like exploration of the nooks and crannies of consciousness and what is surely cinemas first MacGuffin based on a well-pruned piece of anatomy. Rosario Dawson races through Trance. As a truth-seeking everyman McAvoy continues his evolution into brainy action star (hell soon return as young Prof. Xavier in a sequel to ""X-Men First Class""). Like Ewan McGregor in Boyles earlier work McAvoy starts out twerpy but ends up tough and the transition is fun to watch. Dawson meanwhile is out in front in a way this strong sexy New York native has long deserved. The East Village-born actress has to switch gears several times here and is never out of her element. The only times ""Trance"" tests our patience with psych-out rigmarole are when racing to a conclusion it seems crucial stuff was conveniently held back resulting not in a surprised ""Wow"" but in a confused ""Huh?"" But that does not keep this highly artful film from putting you under a spell. USING MOBILE?

Share Tweet Fully buying into Danny Boyles thriller Trance requires an awful lot of faith in hypnosis as a mental tool with Inception-level powers when it comes to creating and enforcing complicated mental states and elaborate mindscapes. Boyle doesnt need hypnosis to justify the films flashy rendition of the world as a collection of crisp sterile glass-and-metal spaces filled with intense neon colors; striking visual styles have been part of his films since the earliest days. But the way he visualizes hypnotic trances as subjective fantasy worlds gives him plenty of excuses to fully indulge his love for dream logic and discombobulating editing. Usually though the plot rationalization for the woozy subjectivity of his cinematography is more universal and easier to accept drugs in Trainspotting; madness in Shallow Grave The Beach and 28 Days Later; the outsized imagination of childhood in Millions; extreme physical privation in 127 Hours; and so forth. In Trance viewers are expected to recognize a hypnotist as someone with a nigh-magical ability to manipulate subjective reality and the entire story hinges on that unlikely belief. James McAvoy opens the film by narrating his way through his work as an auction-house employee explaining the procedures for dealing with attempted theft. The voiceover marks him as the films point-of-view character--but only briefly. Vincent Cassel quickly puts McAvoys exposition to the test by trying to steal a Goya painting as its being sold for millions. But the painting disappears mid-heist and McAvoy after a brutal blow to the head doesnt remember what happened to it. Cassel hires hypnotist Rosario Dawson to dig out the intel while commanding McAvoy to conceal what theyre looking for but Dawson figures out McAvoy is in trouble and quickly takes charge of the process for her own ends. And so the film goes round and round playing conjoined games of ""Whose story is this?"" and ""Whats really going on?"" The answers are simple and hard to believe but the road to get there is rich and complicated filled with hypnosis-induced visions that iterate warp and pile up on each other to dizzying effect. Some are effectively nightmares as McAvoy paws through bloody packaging looking for a dream-item that isnt where its supposed to be in his mind or one of his associates graphically visualizes his worst fear helplessly lying in a grave as hes buried alive. Screenwriter John Hodges (a frequent partner of Boyles here working from a script written and directed for TV by Joe Ahearne in 2001) piles on the obfuscations and confusions winding up with something that feels a bit like the progression of The Machinist (or to a small unfortunate degree Perfect Stranger) except far more propulsive and absorbing. In particular music continues to be a huge part of Boyles landscape The art-heist sequence in particular is soundtracked with pounding music suitable for getting hearts into throats. Narratively Trance is questionable but Boyle and Hodges whisk past all the unlikely developments with enough verve and style to keep audiences from thinking too hard until after theyve left the theater. But even a frame this elaborate and rococo cant entirely disguise the flaws in the artwork itself.

Trance the new film directed by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire 127 Hours) is a high-brainiac art-world thriller that wants to do nothing more (or less) than give your head a majorly pleasurable spin. Simon (James McAvoy) a young Scotsman works at a fine-art auction house in London. He knows a lot about the history of the nude but mostly he knows how to stave off an armed robbery. Thats just what he has to do when Franck (Vincent Cassel) a sleepy-eyed French gangster bursts onto the floor to filch the masterpiece thats being sold a small painting by Goya called Witches in the Air. Boyle shoots the heist like a techno-pop musical number which climaxes with Simon getting bashed on the head. He then wakes up from a coma having forgotten everything including where he hid the painting. (It turns out that he was in on the job.) So how can Franck retrieve that precious piece of art? He sends Simon to see a hypnotherapist named Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) who specializes in recovering the memory of amnesia victims. Before you know it the movie has turned into a fusion of Spellbound Inception at its most convoluted and the head-scratchingly half-baked identity games of Vanilla Sky. The way to make a thriller that teases your brain is to start simple and lead the audience layer by layer into the wrinkles of complication. But Trance is top-heavy with clues subplots flashbacks and hallucinations. The film hinges on the whereabouts of the painting yet that turns out to be the most weightless of MacGuffins. The way Simon Franck and Elizabeth are connected never quite adds up. The escalating ""Huh?"" factor may be related to the leaps made possible by digital editing. You get the feeling that Boyle recut the footage so often and in so many looped combinations that he began to see links between images that no one in the audience would. To avoid spoilers I cant reveal a lot of what happens in Trance. But the more the mystery gets ""solved"" the more it proves there was never any there there to spoil.

The director of Trainspotting and 127 Hours has always delivered a stylish sense of rush (drug-induced or otherwise) and with this slight step backward toward the grit of 1994s Shallow Grave theres reason to be stoked. Were certainly in Boyles comfort zone as his ironic narrator art auctioneer Simon (James McAvoy) details a heist gone wrong techno music pounding as he takes a brutal blow to the head from Franck (Vincent Cassel) his criminal collaborator. Unfortunately for the latter Simon has pulled a double cross and Franck in the unusually warm manner Boyle imparts to thugs decides to allow the now-amnesiac Simon to recover the missing Goya via hypnotherapy. Heres where Rosario Dawsons Elizabeth a soft-spoken psychiatrist and habit breaker comes in--and even if youre sharp enough to predict shes more than what she says she is theres way too much smooth surface to skid off of. Trance suffers from too many cutesy twists and stylish gotchas to take hold as a pulse-pounding thriller; even Dawsons intimate grooming (shes unusually committed to the role) becomes a plot point one that feels showy the more you think about it. The film plays like something Boyle could kick out in his sleep all his supercool devices listlessly deployed in service of a mediocre wet dream.

Look at the uber-combative message boards about Primer or brave the theorizing of Room 237 the docu-analysis of The Shining. One sub-genre of puzzle films--the studio-backed head-scratcher--doesnt see additions all that frequently as bottom-line minded execs surely view the multiplex as a respite from intellectual workouts not another forum for them.Nevertheless the mounds of cash Inception raked in have mattered--recently weve had The Adjustment Bureau Looper and now Danny Boyles Trance cooking our noodles al dente. Trance which belongs alongside Inception in the rarefied sub-sub-genre of inside-the-mind puzzler is nothing if the most eccentric of the bunch; its the only film in recent memory--or perhaps ever--to warn us that depictions of pubic hair can ruin paintings.If rules-and-order-governed Inception is the intellectual law student at the party and self-consciously fun The Adjustment Bureau is the pudgy dude wholl dance with anybody Trance is the really loud guy who wont stop yelling about how 9/11 was an inside job Its got an awfully serious delivery but the graver it gets the sillier it becomes.Film Details Trance RatingR GenreDrama Running Time101 More Info Trailer The guy positing that pubic hair is an artistic dead-end is Simon (James McAvoy) an art auctioneer. He narrates a whiz-bang opening sequence demonstrating his employers fastidious security protocols. This assault-of-the-senses intro reassures the viewer that yes we have entered the realm of 127 Hours director Danny Boyle who is again aggressive in displaying his restless talents incorporating black-and-white photography canted angles throbbing electronica and fourth-wall breakage. The opening isnt likely to win any converts but fans will rest assured knowing their 12 has been earned.Boyles direction chaotic yet carefully orchestrated keeps pumping as the inevitable impossible robbery occurs. Gangster Franck (Vincent Cassel possessor of a great bad-guy face) absconds with a Goya. Or not. Upon realizing his getaway bag is empty Frank must determine what happened to the painting with Simons help. Trances plausibility starts to wear here How exactly did mild-mannered Simon find the cojones for an inside job?A blow Simon sustained during the hold-up has caused amnesia; with no clue where he stashed the painting the thieves are left Goya-less. After torturing Simon Franck (and the director) resorts to an even more desperate measure hypnotherapy. If youve ever wanted to see a therapist sit a bunch of gangsters down and soothingly suggest ""Lets talk about killing"" youre in luck. The beautiful Dr. Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) will induce hypnosis to help--for a cut. Of course femme fatale Elizabeth has a deeper angle.Trance is built around set pieces in Simons dreamlike unconscious. Its a juicy opportunity for Boyle to engage in much visual gamesmanship with endless fields of sunflowers and glimpses of a man being buried alive among his most compelling conjurings. Yet Boyles hyperactivity is a problem as the sequences abstraction and haphazardness--heads are blown off but keep talking characters morph into other characters--prevent them from developing narrative stakes. Unlike Inceptions dream world which doled out rules and keys to understanding it Trances is never imbued with any structure or meaning. Anything goes which may make all this great fun for the hallucinogenically inclined but since nothing in these sequences has any lasting consequences suspense is difficult to amplify.Not that this thriller lacks in tension. Trance packs many reveals and the guessing game of whos who and whats what continues throughout. But with its terribly campy setup (hypnotherapy and gangsters? Ones inner child and murderous showdowns?) Trance could have gotten some mileage out of comedy; the film is under the mistaken impression that its unmoored trance sequences are compelling enough to justify their implausibility. In one scene Elizabeth puts Franck and his tough-as-nails henchmen into a fearful trance in order to teach Simon that its okay to embrace vulnerability. If getting-in-touch-with-your-feelings pop-psychology played out by vicious thugs sounds like it could be funny well youd be right--but the scene is played straight leaving the viewer unsure how seriously the filmmakers take their premise. Thats a puzzle you cant solve on your own.Follow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Zachary Wigon Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

To sidestep this problem by way of confronting it directly a sub-genre of films naturally emerged in which psychology is not only used as a means of driving the plot but also as its vehicle exploring the mind by way of actually setting a film in one. This naturally is a demented challenge unto itself as even those notable movies which were successfully able to conflate the inner-workings of the human brain with the demands of narrative storytelling (""Inception"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" being the two most obvious examples from recent years) work because they expound upon how we feel by having fun with how we think which is the opposite tact of most narrative fiction. Unfortunately when movies that literally delve into the folds of the human brain forget either part of the equation they often prove that a mind is a terrible thing to waste and it can be an even worse place to visit. With that in mind (lame pun pathetically intended) Danny Boyles ""Trance"" finds this strange sub-genre at its worst. An insufferable cross between ""Inception"" and the twisty heist noirs of Jean-Pierre Melville ""Trance"" is a shapelessly propulsive mess of pop psychology and poor drama as laughably pseudo-scientific as Hitchcocks ""Spellbound"" but with none of that films clear human charm. ""If memory serves"" is how the saying goes and ""Trance"" is a movie about identifying its master. We begin with a Goya painting (""Witches in the Air"" to be precise) which will inevitably prove to be the height of the films artistry (talk about setting a needlessly high bar for yourself; its like Jay Leno using Richard Pryor as a warmup comic). Goyas eerie imagery is a too-perfect fit for this muddled story of psychic manipulation more evocatively articulating a haunted sense of suggestion in one still image than Boyle does in the 101 restless minutes that he has at his disposal. Perhaps then its appropriate that the ""Witches in the Air"" is stolen during the films overcomplicated opening sequence in which a fine art auctioneer named Simon (James McAvoy whose smarmy voiceover channels the horrors of ""Wanted"") lays out the procedures by which he and his coworkers are to protect their enormously valuable paintings in the event of an attempted robbery. Naturally Simons auction house is promptly robbed. Franck (Vincent Cassel and yes its spelled ""Franck"") and his merry gang of thugs bust in under cover of smoke grenades and Simon immediately rolls up the canvas and tries to shove it down the emergency chute. Franck catches up with Simon at the last possible moment conks him on the head with the butt of his giant shotgun and then makes off with the masterwork (valued at nearly 30 million). Except we soon learn that Franck only thought he had the painting in his possession and Simon - whos in cahoots with the thieves - cant remember where he hid it on account of the fact that he was conked in the head with a giant shotgun. Desperate to locate the information that hes convinced still resides somewhere within Simons thick skull Franck forces his stooge to visit Elizabeth Lamb (Rosario Dawson) the sexiest hypnotherapist in all of London and perhaps the only person qualified to plumb the depths of Simons subconscious and retrieve the vital information. And thats when things go off the rails of this narrative thats ultimately as much about a painting as ""The Maltese Falcon"" is about a statue. Elizabeths motives for becoming involved are as unclear as her techniques and Boyle is so eager to play around in Simons mind that he fails to provide an adequate foundation for the fun he has once he begins the brain-dive. Working from a script by Joe Ahearne and John Hodge (a second attempt at a story that originally aired as a British TV movie) Boyle is enabled to indulge in all of his most frenetic tics and tendencies unencumbered by the insidious forces of ""logic"" and ""location"" that prevented ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""127 Hours"" from entirely submitting to the banality of Boyles hyper-maximalist aesthetic hedonism. Boyles unwillingness to become stagnant is admirable but his digital frenzy found its ideal home right off the bat in 2002s ""28 Days Later"" in which the rudimentary technology perfectly complimented the films end times unease. Here - re-teaming with cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle who rose to prominence in the world of Dogme 95 and has worked on all of Boyles features since the digital revolution except for ""Sunshine"" - it seems like Boyle is more interested in how he can mess with the image than he is in what its revealing an approach that capably (if obviously) illustrates the fragmentation of Simons mind but fatally fails to articulate the shifting power dynamics at the throbbing heart of this plot mash. Ultimately amidst all of the shot refractions strange asides about Elizabeths pubic hair and the iPad thats found in someones mind (I dont even know) ""Trance"" is at its best when calms itself enough to focus on the psychic manipulations that steer drive the bizarre love triangle between Simon Franck and Elizabeth. Simon is a hopelessly dull protagonist but the films greatest coup is in how it plays with the idea that this might not actually be his story. Franck and Elizabeth arent trying to find a painting so much as theyre vying for the lead role in a picture and the various means by which they try and play one another would be interesting if they werent muddled into sensationalistic nonsense climaxing with an action sequence thats only legitimate bearing on human psychology is how it reflects Danny Boyles desire to drive a flaming car off a pier. Forgettably scored by Underworlds Rick Smith (""Beaucoup Fish"" for life yall) ""Trance"" doesnt just share the name of a musical genre but also its defining qualities; the highly suggestible (a percentage of the population that Boyle refers to as ""virtuosos"") are seduced by its rhythms while the rest of us are forced to endure an endless drone of flashing lights and thumping bass. This time the synapses just didnt click. No piece of art is worth a human life"" Simon tells us. ""Trance"" isnt even worth 101 minutes of one. Danny Boyle will be back but heres hoping the song doesnt remain the same.

If Christopher Nolan had much feeling below the waist he could have cooked up this circuitous psycho-sexy heist thriller the engagingly silly plot mechanics of which are tricky to describe without giving the game away.This much you can know sharp-suited London auctioneer Simon (James McAvoy) is the inside man for art thief Franck (Vincent Cassel). When his planned double-cross during the theft of a prized Goya goes awry Simon loses all memory of where hes hidden the painting. Enter alluring hypnotherapist Elizabeth (Rosario Dawson) who may or may not know more than shes letting on. Adapted from Joe Ahearnes 2001 TV film its essentially Eternal Inception of the Spellbound Mind though its shallow mind games are strictly disconnected from the heart. Like a jigsaw puzzle of a priceless painting the fun lies in putting it together not contemplating the fractured final product.Still after Slumdog Millionaire and the stifling 127 Hours its a kick to see Boyle back in lickety-split genre mode. Reunited with screenwriter John Hodge and with a game sideburned McAvoy as a Ewan McGregor proxy this is the kind of film he might have made in the 90s only flashing all the technical elan hes gained since then. Due respect to McAvoy but its cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and his gorgeous radioactive vision of our city that are the true stars here.

Hypnotism on the other hand is fair game in this brash beyond-belief psychothriller from director Danny Boyle who seizes on a script co-written by Joe Ahearne and longtime Boyle collaborator John Hodge as a chance to play elaborate mind games with fans of his early work. A trippy variation on the dream-within-a-dream movie Boyles return-to-form crimer constantly challenges what auds think they know but neglects to establish why they should care. The pics flashy style plus its stark violence and nudity ought to transfix male genre auds. More of a conceptual exercise than a conventional film noir ""Trance"" demonstrates Boyles determination to continue to overcome seemingly impossible filmmaking challenges. After painting himself out of a physical corner with ""127 Hours"" the director now confronts a psychic obstacle in attempting to tell a complex genre movie from within the confines of one persons consciousness -- even as others noodle with the same characters subconscious. A charismatic yet miscast James McAvoy plays the mark a clean-scrubbed auction-house employee named Simon who snaps into action during the attempted theft of a Goya painting. Back in the day all it took was a bit of muscle and some nerve to rob art from auction Simon explains in a stretch of Scottish-lilted direct-address narration that not only recalls Hodges earlier scripts (""Shallow Grave"" ""Trainspotting"") but suggests a younger softer-edged Ewan McGregor. To whom is Simon speaking The audience? A hypnotist? The cops? Doesnt matter. The film takes place mostly in Simons head so its his experience auds see unfolding. After establishing how staff have been trained to protect the auction-house assets in the prologue Simon springs the pics first twist He was the capers inside man. Problem is after removing the Goya from its frame he sustained a blow to the head and the crucial memory of where he stashed the painting is beyond his reach. Torture doesnt work to bring it back so underworld tough guy Franck (Vincent Cassel terrifically unpredictable) suggests hypnotism allowing Simon to pick his own mesmerist. He opts for Elizabeth Lamb played by Rosario Dawson whose sultry power over men makes plausible how easily her character manages to put Simon under. While neither the film nor its goons puts any stock in amnesia both encourage a willing suspension of disbelief when it comes to far more elaborate feats of mind-control. In that respect Boyle seems to be asking whether he too can play the hypnotist. Using dynamic visual storytelling slick cutting and a propulsive electronic score can he successfully convince rational auds to buy into an increasingly far-fetched story? The stunt works for a time. On Simons second session with Elizabeth she pounces demanding to see the men who put him up to this -- and offering her services for a share in the prize should they find the painting. Its at this point in the film that things start to get really weird as the narrative starts to fold back on itself blurring the lines between reality and the hypothetical. Each time Elizabeth puts Simon in trance she takes him to a new location in his mind making it increasingly difficult for auds to tell fantasy from memory from lived experience. As Simons sense of danger grows these scenes become more fragmented and violent which allows the pic to introduce and instantly erase shocking homicidal behavior but puts a strain on McAvoy who seems too nice to harbor such demons. Boyle has cited Nicolas Roeg as an influence on the films disorienting style and sure enough ""Trance"" shares the jagged subjectivity of ""Performance"" and ""Dont Look Now"" along with the directors raw treatment of anger and arousal. The deeper things go the kinkier they get as Elizabeth finds herself seducing both Franck and Simon -- but are these fantasies real or projections of their jealous imaginations? Theyre certainly real enough for audiences who wont soon forget the sight of a denuded Dawson or the erotic art history lesson that explains her carefully sculpted appearance. Superficial pleasures aside however the convoluted script jumps and dodges so often it soon loses the thread of its own story. This isnt ""Inception"" where layers of experience are nested neatly one inside the next but rather a frittata its ingredients distinguishable only by the various hyper-saturated colors that seem to define each scene. The lost painting is just the first of multiple MacGuffins after which Simons missing memory becomes the thing they all so desperately need to recover. And then quite abruptly Simon finds himself on the margins and Elizabeth takes centerstage -- an opportunity for which Dawson proves more than ready -- leading to a succession of reversals that seem a bit too dependent on enormous gaps in logic only half-excused by the pics record-skip storytelling style. With all its trickery the film presents a sexy distraction but proves a mind is a terrible thing to waste. Trance (U.K.) Reviewed at Fox studios Los Angeles March 18 2013. MPAA Rating R.

Daily Edition Login to download Trance Film Review 522 PM PDT 3/20/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A super-stylish modern noir thats rather too clever for its own good. TWITTER Danny Boyles modern London noir stars James McAvoy Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson. Danny Boyle has great and plainly evident fun adding twists and curves and tunnels and endless style to his modern London noir Trance but he makes so many left turns that the film turns in on itself rather than going anywhere. The trickiness of this tale of a big-time art heist and its aftermath generates intrigue; the visual and aural flash is seductive; and then there is Rosario Dawson who has never been as dazzling or dominant onscreen as she is in this central performance. But in the end this head trip about thieves treachery and memory recovery seems more ornamental than substantial a sleight-of-hand piece that leaves you with that empty feeling. Commercial prospects internationally seem good with edge- and hip-seeking young audiences not so hot with the rest. At the crux of the knotty screenplay by Joe Ahearne (who wrote and directed the little-seen 2001 British TV movie of the same name) and John Hodge (who scripted Boyles first four films beginning with Shallow Grave and Trainspotting) is the inability of one robber to remember where he might have left a Goya painting after the gang successfully lifts it from a tightly secured auction where ""Witches in the Air"" had just sold for PS27.5 million (in real life the painting resides in the Prado in Madrid). STORY Danny Boyle on His Psychological Thriller Trance and Why Coppola Is King And why cant Simon (James McAvoy) recall where he hid the painting? Because his cohort Francis (Vincent Cassel) suspecting betrayal cracked him on the cranium during the job. For a film built on the premise of continual revelations of new levels of awareness complicity intentions and motivations its not too much to disclose that the heist is an inside job perpetrated by Francis and three thugs in cahoots with auction house employee Simon who firmly believes in his companys motto ""No piece of art is worth a human life."" Enduring torture before convincing Francis that he truly doesnt know the whereabouts of the 1797 painting which depicts a gang of evil-doers in the act of a snatching Simon agrees to undergo hypnosis therapy in the hope of disinterring the crucial bit of memory. This takes on a comical dimension when the distractingly beautiful American therapist Dr. Elizabeth Lamb (Dawson) upon discovering that Simons crew is listening in insists that they join in for group sessions. Once she realizes what the stakes are she wants an equal piece of the action. And so it goes from there as the film sails off in a swirl of one-upmanship mutual suspicions sexual competitiveness and ever-morphing personal geometry that depends most of all upon whos thinking more moves ahead in the game than anyone. At first Elizabeth appears to be firmly in the drivers seat as she alone seems to hold the key that will unlock Simons mind. This impression is enormously boosted by Dawsons powerful presence; Elizabeths mental capacity registers as all the more formidable thanks to the personal confidence Dawson conveys which in turn is multiplied by the palpable erotic allure she exudes at every moment to those around her. PHOTOS 10 Hollywood Films Tweaked for International Release How the sexual equation plays out is integral to the final stretch of a film thats paced like a DJ gradually increasing the throbbing beat and tempo of tracks before reaching a heart-pounding climax. From the point of view of visual and aural sensation Trance goes a fair way toward living up to its name. Thanks to Boyles aggressive direction and Anthony Dod Mantles vibrantly colored cinematography which combine for a more deliberately consistent and glowing look than they did in Slumdog Millionaire the film possesses a robust physicality that constantly engages whether its patently artificial as in the look of a club where some of the interrogations take place or emphatically natural as when Dawson strides toward the camera in a spectacularly surprising nude scene. McAvoy and Cassel also are shot in a way that makes them pop and both actors are completely alive to every moment of their scenes. Beat up bloodied and beleaguered through much of the story McAvoys sweaty Simon holds assorted secrets until very close to the end while Cassels Francis provokes fascination as a tough guy who eventually shows other colors particularly vulnerability. On this point Boyle scores good laughs by subjecting Francis three thugs (Danny Sapani Matt Cross and Wahab Sheikh) to therapy in which innermost fears are revealed in quick flashback. Trance is not precisely a case of all style and no substance as Boyle and his writers are in fact trying to deepen and in certain ways humanize hardboiled crime drama by introducing multiple layers of meaning emotion and insight; enough pieces of the puzzle fit that the story if one straightens the sequencing and psychology out in ones mind seems to make sense. PHOTOS THRs Director Roundtable All the same the overriding impression is one of a game in which the narrative tricks and amped-up pulse dominate over all other concerns. Its as if the challenge the filmmakers set for themselves was not so much to tell a story as to discover how many clever and devious ways they could disguise and hide whats coming to the point that the subject seems to serve the style rather than the other way around.
