Amusing indie comedy blithely blurs the line between risque and raunchy often to hilarious effect. With shrewd marketing pic could click with adult auds during theatrical run and make a bigger splash as homevid fare. If the Farrelly Brothers were to film their version of a naughty bawdy dinner-theater trifle from the 70s the result likely would resemble ""The Oh in Ohio."" Amusing indie comedy blithely blurs the line between risque and raunchy often to hilarious effect. With shrewd marketing pic could click with adult auds during theatrical run and make a bigger splash as homevid fare. The titular ""Oh"" stands for orgasm a state of sexual arousal that has remained consistently elusive for Priscilla (Parker Posey) throughout a decade of marriage to Jack (Paul Rudd). And while Priscilla claims she is perfectly satisfied with their lovemaking Jack is growing increasingly frustrated by his inability to fully excite his wife. Worse hes also nearing premature burn-out as a high school teacher -- making him all the more vulnerable to the alluring appeal of Kristen (Mischa Barton) a willowy student who wants to ease his pain. While Jack grapples with temptation -- far less successfully it should be noted than Kevin Spaceys character in ""American Beauty"" -- Priscilla seeks help from a flamboyant sex guru (Liza Minnelli) who advises a do-it-yourself approach. Priscilla normally channels most of her time and energy into her PR job of attracting industry to Cleveland (where pic was shot). But after breaking down and buying a vibrator from a slinky lesbian sex-shop salesclerk (unbilled Heather Graham) she becomes addicted to self-stimulation to the point of finding inventive new uses for her vibrating cell phone. Latter twist cues an uproarious set piece that plays like equal parts soft-core porn and ""I Love Lucy"" while showcasing Poseys talent for physical comedy. When Jack moves out of the house (and of course into an affair with Kristen) Priscilla finds an unlikely Mr. Right Larry (Danny DeVito) a paunchy and balding swimming pool mogul whos two or three decades her senior. Despite the age difference however hes even better than a battery-operated appliance when it comes to causing climaxes. Working from clever but uneven script by Adam Wierzbianski helmer Billy Kent relies on his strong cast to get pic through occasional bumpy spots. DeVito gives a thoroughly engaging and surprisingly sweet performance in a role that other thesps might have overplayed unattractively. He cracks wise with gusto but expresses emotion with heart. That goes a long way toward keeping ""The Oh in Ohio"" on an even keel as it shifts gears in the final reels moving from broad farce to romantic comedy. Posey gracefully maneuvers a tricky transition of her own tracing an arc from uptight denial to lusty excess to serene self-confidence. (Her final line is the perfect capper for both her character and the pic itself.) Rudd is at his funniest while Jack stews in discontent spewing barbed commentary that indicates serious self-loathing. Hes also adept at infusing romantic longing with sardonic self-deprecating wit. Keith David brings a touch of sly-fox mischievousness to his supporting turn as Jacks best buddy while Barton is appealing and poised as the mature-beyond-her-years Kristen. Minnelli and Robert John Burke (as Kristens father) score laughs while demonstrating how to score maximum impact in single-scene cameos. Overall tech package is impressive enough to suggest Priscilla would approve of pic as suitably image-enhancing for Cleveland.

Take a good look at her Shes Hepburns double and so naturally stylized that you can just imagine her slipping into those head-tilting gestures that playful aristocratic lilt. Yet its Parker Poseys extreme stylization her distinctive way of putting air quotes around joy or despair that has also limited her as an actress. Mostly she has thrived in goofy-camp indie throwaways that exploit her penchant for alluring self-mockery. This years model is The Oh in Ohio in which Posey plays a married Cleveland commerce PR executive who has never had an orgasm. Until she discovers the vibrator that is at which point she becomes a big-O addict squirming around in her bedsheets then finally having one right in the boardroom -- an over-the-top scene that the movie gets away with only because Posey brings it off so to speak with such disheveled charm. The Oh in Ohio is a silly amusing trifle. Paul Rudd as the frustrated high school biology teacher to whom Posey is married creates a surly sympathy as he pursues his own questionable liberation (he sleeps with a student played with sexy impassivity by Mischa Barton) and then Posey having unlocked her inner pleasure seeker does something truly extreme She falls for the local swimming-pool salesman an aging munchkin in a ponytail played rather sweetly by Danny DeVito. Its safe to say that this is one actress who has yet to meet her Cary Grant.

And it would seem that her character Evelyn Ryan is perfect effortlessly managing the lives of 10 children and an alcoholic husband (Woody Harrelson) cunningly eking out the family finances by her winnings from jingle contests cooking the meals and cleaning the house and folding the clothes so that all the corners line up perfectly even in the midst of turmoil and always with a patient smile. ""Im not a saint"" she says late in the film and the line weirdly echoes -- this film does everything but canonize her. Based on a lively touching memoir by Evelyns daughter Terry Jane Andersons film brings an odd bounciness to this womans difficult life. Domestic scenes in the Ryans cramped home are interrupted by kitschy song-and-dance numbers as the words Evelyn carefully sculpts for her contests come to life. And at times Moore steps out of the movie to address the camera sometimes even standing beside her own character. All this feels unnecessarily theatrical and weakens the real-life story behind it. Theres a disturbing angry undertone to the movie -- about the powerlessness of married women of that era -- but Anderson keeps raising the issue and then pulling a gimmicky curtain in front of it. But the film still resonates at times very powerfully so because of Moores performance. Shes no stranger to playing 50s housewives Evelyn is a more working-class version of the perfectly controlled ladies she played in ""The Hours"" and ""Far From Heaven."" Here like her ""Far From Heaven"" counterpart shes got a spine of steel and a voice of satin murmuring praise to her children even as she negotiates around their often scary self-loathing father. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio"" with Julianne Moore Woody Harrelson Laura Dern Ellary Porterfield. Written and directed by Jane Anderson based on the book ""The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio How My Mother Raised 10 Kids on 25 Words or Less"" by Terry Ryan. 99 minutes. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements some disturbing images and language. Metro. ""Youre too damn happy"" he tells her as she giggles with the children while dreaming up a new contest slogan and the miracle of Moores characterization is that we believe her -- despite everything she is happy. Evelyn Ryan who died in 1998 would seem to have had one of the rarest of gifts the ability to find joy in the moment even when things seem dark. This film is an uneven but loving tribute to a remarkable woman -- who would undoubtedly have wished to rewrite it herself.

"Prize captures family drama vividly - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Prize captures family drama vividly By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 14 2005 Julianne Moore has never looked as relaxed as she does in The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio."" This is a major accomplishment since shes playing mother to 10 children and wife to one very childish man.Evelyn Ryan lives in the movies titular burg during the 1950s and 1960s. While her husband Kelly (Woody Harrelson) goes to work in a factory she runs the house a modest little nest that seems like a shoebox for a family of 12 but she makes it work. After most of the days duties have been performed Evelyn sits in front of the television set with the kids and thinks up little ditties to enter in the sponsors jingle-writing contests.Her home is full of winnings that include a much disliked storage freezer. Shes also won a couple of trips a few cars and when it really matters cash. Still the Ryans it seems are always on the brink of eviction with Kelly drinking away his earnings in pitiful binges of outraged emasculation.Theres not much to the films story but the characterization of a familys life is vivid and rich We see the kids grow up and wonder if the Ryans marriage will survive Kellys swelling insecurity.Jane Anderson directed and adapted the movie from a memoir by one of Evelyns daughters. Clearly Anderson takes Evelyn seriously. Jingle-writing is not a knack. Its a vocation and a skill. But Anderson whose previous films -- When Billie Beat Bobby"" Normal"" -- have all been TV movies of above-average intelligence doesnt hold Evelyns homemaking in contempt. While raising a family of 12 might not be a calling Anderson certainly wants a modern audience to understand that it is a job. (We never do see Kelly at work.)Its the Ryans second oldest girl Terry who wrote the memoir and was rightly nicknamed Tuff."" She is the most outspoken of the children (although they all seem equally fearful of and exasperated with their father) and in challenging her mothers tolerance of Kelly shes meant to be a voice of contemporary reason. (The girl who plays her Ellary Porterfield is touching.) But shrewdly Anderson doesnt allow Harrelson to play the character as a monster; hes sad and redeemable and Evelyn believes in him long after hes given up on himself.If this woman sounds too good to be true she is. But arent all great mothers? Evelyn is presented as the quintessence of kindness as impossibly happy. She lives on the bright side. But some days are overcast and the better we get to know her the easier it becomes to spot the clouds. Shes lonely too which is why her discovery of another group of jingle-writing women who meet 85 miles away at Laura Derns house thrills her so Shes not alone.Far From Heaven"" and The Hours"" demonstrated that Moore is comfortable in these period housewife parts. Sometimes you can see her thinking about the incongruity between her modernity and her vintage surroundings until she appears to be having an out-of-body experience as she did in The Hours."" This actually is the problem with Moore in too many movies Her tense manner churning brain and skill often get in the way of our hearts.Part of the reason Moore is so at ease in Prize Winner"" may be that shes working with a woman director. Anderson is the rare filmmaker who doesnt want to use the actress as an instrument or to exploit her independent-movie cachet. She has freed Moore to be what she hasnt been with many directors credibly human. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Prize-Winning Strength washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Prize-Winning Strength Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday October 14 2005 If Julianne Moores most notable performances recently have been as women representing the shadow material of the 1950s -- first as the wife of a repressed homosexual in ""Far From Heaven"" and next as a woman suffocating as wife and mother in ""The Hours"" -- in ""The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio"" she brings the era cheerily into the light. The movie has been adapted from Terry Ryans best-selling memoir of her mother Evelyn a woman of endless optimism who reared 10 children and supported an alcoholic and abusive husband by entering jingle-writing contests. As one of her kids observes in the film were it not for the sexism of the era Evelyn would have been running an ad agency or penning her own column for the Chicago Tribune. But it was the 1950s (and early 1960s) so Evelyn built her career in quips and squibs each one a proto-feminist step on what would later become a far louder and longer march. ""The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio"" isnt very cinematic -- Jane Anderson who also wrote the script tries to inject visual interest with lots of kitschy collage effects. But it has its own subversive power as it elevates one familys struggle for working-class survival and valorizes a woman of simple faith and inner strength. During a conversation with her husband (Woody Harrelson looking suspiciously like Willem Dafoe in ""Mississippi Burning"") Evelyn at one point insists that shes no saint. This warm moving tribute suggests otherwise. -- Ann Hornaday (c) 2005 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/13/AR2005101300621.html,200,theprizewinnerofdefianceohio7,theprizewinnerofdefianceohio,washingtonpost

"Julianne Moores commercial success. Slate Sign In Sign Up Julianne Moores commercial success. Julianne Moores commercial success. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 4 2005 237 PM Jingle Belle Julianne Moores The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio. By David Edelstein Moores a winner The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio (DreamWorks) celebrates supermom Evelyn Ryan (Julianne Moore) When life gives her a lemon she doesnt just make lemonade--she writes a jingle for it The wife of an alcoholic and the mother of 10 children this talented ex-journalist spends her days cleaning ironing cooking changing diapers and transporting kids but she carries a notebook for those moments when her muse pops in for a visit. By winning mail-in contests with her clever poems lyrics and slogans she manages--barely--to keep her family housed and fed. Although the movie doesnt underline the irony Evelyn has found a novel way to extract money from the 50s corporate big daddies who work to keep her down The patriarchal culture taketh away and the patriarchal culture giveth. A reverent adaptation of a best-selling memoir by Terry Ryan Prize Winner is an honest tear-jerker It made me blubber not by laying on the you-must-pay-the-rent-but-I-cant-pay-the-rent bathos but by alternating scenes of economic desperation with ironic 50s sunniness. Advertisement The screenwriter and first-time director is Jane Anderson whose script for the TV movie The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom (starring Holly Hunter) was one of the wittier in-your-face Americana satires of recent years. Anderson loves kitschy montages and the film abounds in computer-generated trickery--appliances or bicycles that thanks to some contest or other appear with a little ding when old ones break. Moores Ryan (who narrates the film in a clever departure from the book) explains to the audience how these contests are judged and is instantly whisked through the air to a New York skyscraper where platoons of women (in period footage) sit opening envelopes. My what technology can do these days Julianne Moore is not only one of our best actresses shes in a league by herself as an impressionist. The crook of her arm as she stands in the kitchen with her hand on her hip the way she delicately crosses her legs the flash of a smile the tinkling diction Its all so 50s--or at least so 50s by way of talk shows commercials and movies. But Moore is not all surface. At her best shes one of those actresses who hint at the tension between the mask and the person underneath--in this case (as in Far From Heaven) the person struggling to maintain the persona that her husband and neighbors expect to see and that her children need to see. Evelyns husband Kelly Ryan (Woody Harrelson) is stiff and recessive--until he drinks. Then he transforms into the dark underbelly of the 50s male--enraged at his wife for stepping into the vacuum (and with that infuriating smile) that his alcoholism and lack of financial success has left. An aspiring singer whose vocal cords were damaged in a car accident (we see it in a flashback--not pretty) Kelly veers back and forth between childlike dependence and abuse; chagrined after his drunken dish-throwing outbursts he serves Evelyn tea and calls her ""Mommy."" Its strange to see Harrelson in this part after all his wiggy countercultural turns. A straighter actor a Ward Cleaver-type might have made an eerier Kelly although Harrelsons lingering serial-killer aura certainly gives you a frisson. He gets this demonic twisty-faced thing going and you expect hair to sprout on his face. One might question why a family with such an unstable breadwinner would expand and expand. But back then Catholics like the Ryans obeyed the command not to pull out. When a priest arrives to counsel Kelly on his outbursts he focuses instead on Evelyns wifely deficiencies. He adds ""No one says that life is easy."" Although Evelyns ardor for her husband clearly cools (he continues to call her ""Mommy"" but she stops calling him ""Dad"") she keeps the family afloat pleading for credit from an unsympathetic milkman (""Im not a bank. ... You want something in life you gotta pay for it"") and entering every last contest to help pay off the family debts. To add insult to injury a Miss America contestant on television says there shouldnt be a woman president because ""women are high-strung and emotional people."" But Evelyn doesnt bristle Shes a model of Christian forbearance. Its only her daughter Terry (Ellary Porterfield) who expresses anger--the same daughter who would move to San Francisco and cut her hair short and write a book memorializing this American saint. A director like Jonathan Demme might have hit the kitsch motif more glancingly and used less predictable music. But Anderson finds the perfect loopy-humanist tone in scenes with Laura Dern as a housewife and fellow prizewinner who reaches out to Evelyn through the mail. It helps that Dern is beautiful and buoyant with none of the beyond-the-call-of-duty bedragglement she had in her last role in We Dont Live Here Anymore. The only serious mistake in The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio is the ending in which Evelyns real children appear. Why dont they just pose on the porch of the familys old house instead of making like actors and pretending to go through their mothers stuff? Its not just the shift from stylization to bogus realism that makes you squirm. Its the icky hard sell complete with schlock piano chords. All it needs is a corny jingle.

Starring Julianne Moore and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Jane Anderson. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Julianne Moore is alarmingly perky in early scenes of ""The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio."" Swathed in rose-colored housedresses that highlight her mood she appears to be channeling Joan Allen in ""Pleasantville."" But Moores 1950s housewife doesnt have much to be zippy about. Her husband blows his meager factory salary on booze instead of milk for their 10 kids and confronting him with his irresponsibility only makes him abusive. So why is Moore as the title character Evelyn Ryan smiling? It soon becomes apparent that Ryans determined cheerfulness is largely a charade an attempt to hold her fragile family together with assurances that everything is all right even as their house is about to be repossessed. In a sense shes a reincarnation of the immigrant Norwegian matriarch in ""I Remember Mama"" who made up a bank account so her children would feel secure. ""Prizewinners"" director Jane Anderson has a real feel for family life as she demonstrated in the keenly observed HBO drama ""Normal."" The Ryan offspring are shown helping one another a trait in big families where parents cant possibly pay attention to everyone. The young actors look and behave like real kids not the sanitized version usually seen in movies. But Anderson who wrote the script based on San Francisco author Terry Ryans touching memoir about her mother should have trusted this remarkable true story a little more and not felt compelled to pump it up. In one hokey scene a duplicate Moore appears beside herself to narrate the beleaguered Evelyns tale. Moores portrayal transcends unnecessary gimmicks like this. Hers is an impressively layered performance acting the role of a wife and mother burdened with enormous responsibility who believes it incumbent on her to act lighthearted. Smiling through adversity Moore is the heart and soul of ""Prizewinner"" and worthy of prize consideration come Oscar time. How appropriate if Moore wins something considering this is Evelyns talent. In the 1950s and early 60s companies promoted contests asking the public to compose ads for new products. Evelyn proved to have a knack for writing jingles such as ""My Frisk-the-Frigidaire Clean-the-Cupboards-Bare Sandwich"" -- her winning entry for a sandwich-naming contest. Informed shed come in first Evelyn would confide to whomever was nearby ""That wasnt even my best."" A few decades later such creativity would have landed her a top spot at an ad agency. As it was she got a free 10-minute shopping spree at the local supermarket vividly re-created by production designer Edward McAvoy. As Evelyn dashes through the aisles filling her cart the labels on the cans are of actual brands from the 50s reproduced in intricate detail. Its a trip down memory lane for anyone who lived through that time. The big-ticket prizes like a Triumph sports car have to be sold to pay for basic provisions. Evelyns husband Kelly (Woody Harrelson) becomes increasingly resentful of her as breadwinner and demonstrates it by smashing a freezer she won and generally belittling her accomplishments. ""Prizewinner"" goes out of its way to avoid portraying Kelly as a total ogre showing him playing with the kids when he isnt soused and yelling obscenities at a ballgame on the radio or locking everybody out. Still its hard to understand why Evelyn stays with him and a flashback in which Moore in the awkward role of narrator explains that Kelly wasnt always this way doesnt answer the question. Harrelson is too darn likable to pull off such a complex personality. Hes seems to be winking at us to signal that Kelly isnt such a bad sort. The beer belly he grows over the years isnt very convincing either. Since the rest of Harrelson is trim and fit it appears that increasingly plump pillows have been stuffed under his shirt. But nothing can detract from this heartwarming inspirational story of the plucky Evelyn Ryan whose luck has yet to give out. Her reward this time is a sublime actress to play her. -- Advisory This film contains scenes of family violence.

A way with words Julianne Moore plays a 1950s jingle writer. DreamWorks Pictures An engaging film bolstered by the stellar performance of Julianne Moore as a defiantly upbeat mother of 10 who overcomes adversity by writing contest jingles. Moore is exceptional as Evelyn Ryan one of the more stalwart and inspiring characters in recent movies. Her portrayal has depth nuance humor warmth and above all intelligence. Director Jane Anderson has taken the book by Terry Ryan The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio How My Mother Raised 10 Kids on 25 Words or Less and fashioned a faithful adaptation enhanced by some creative license. About the movie The Prizewinner of Defiance Ohio    (out of four) Stars Julianne Moore Woody Harrelson Laura Dern Director Jane Anderson Distributor DreamWorks Rating PG-13 for thematic elements some disturbing images and language Running time 1 hour 30 minutes Opens Friday in select cities Anderson imbues the film with a colorful 50s kitschy quality that works well with the material after an initially off-putting narration by Moore about the contesting life. When TV advertising was in its fledgling state in the 50s a group of unknown jingle-belles supplied Madison Avenue with many of the catchy ditties that defined the era. Yet many of these wordsmiths never set foot in New York spending their days in small towns raising families. The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio is about just such a person. A woman with a gift for poetry and prose she coped with poverty and an alcoholic husband raising her children and winning contests. A budding journalist before her early marriage Evelyn Ryan began entering contests to keep her family afloat. As they were about to be evicted from a rented house she won several thousand dollars which she used to buy a modest home. When appliances broke she won replacements. Ryan was no Pollyanna She had a down-to-earth awareness of her situation overlaid with a can-do spirit which she passed on to her kids. Had she lived a decade or two later she might have been a top ad exec on Madison Avenue. Moore conveys Evelyn Ryans good cheer with an honest regard for the character and without caricature though Woody Harrelson as her husband does lapse into a stereotypical performance. A poignant look at a family overcoming adversity the film also provides a glimpse of past popular culture many of us know little about.

Depending on how well DreamWorks sub-division Go Fish gets the word out women should respond and appeal of this all-American tale will be felt in smaller cities as well as large. A true account of how a womans intelligence and stoicism saves her huge family ""The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio"" sensitively presents an unvarnished view of the 1950s and early 60s through the subtle filter of the present. Tailor-made for writer-director Jane Anderson -- making her first feature film after several small-screen triumphs (""The Baby Dance"" ""Normal"" etc.) -- pic allows Julianne Moore to again inhabit the conformist 50s but in an entirely different key than ""Far From Heaven"" or ""The Hours."" Depending on how well DreamWorks sub-division Go Fish gets the word out women should respond and appeal of this all-American tale will be felt in smaller cities as well as large. As far back as her brilliant solo theater work ""How to Raise a Gifted Child"" Anderson has been concerned with the relationship between mothers and children -as well as true sagas. Though her original work can be quite dark as in ""The Baby Dance"" ""Prize Winner"" which Anderson also scripted is told in a memoir form that both lightens and deepens the story about a woman with exceptional talent for writing jingles yet is born in the wrong era to fully realize it. Even more than in ""Far From Heaven"" Moores housebound wife is a study in pent-up brilliance with extraordinary devotion to her family. Having delivered her 10th (and final) child in 1956 Evelyn Ryan is already a frequent winner of the jingle contests companies used to hawk their consumer products after WWII. Inserting contest forms into her Underwood as easily as she slips off a diaper Evelyn and her Defiance Ohio home appear to be the picture of Midwestern bliss. But cracks soon appear below the domestic sheen and the familys lower-middle-class condition is only part of it. Husband Kelly (Woody Harrelson) a factory machinist drinks himself into a lather every evening. Its Evelyns steady winnings that provide the margin to barely pay for essentials like milk. Evelyns occasional winnings -- one of them big enough to place a down payment on a house feel like the well-earned victories of a talented writer who happens to be a full-time mom rather than scripted fantasies. Yet they also feel somewhat hollow since the family can never get ahead; consumer goods being produced by Americas exploding economy are frequent prizes and a large freezer plunked down in the middle of the kitchen strikes Kelly as a symbol for whats wrong with his life. As years roll into the 60s the film develops a fine novelistic view of the sacrifices made by ordinary people growing older. Few of the kids are foregrounded but one who is -- Tuff (Ellary Porterfield) -- learns valuable lessons at 16 when shes able to meet some fellow ace contestants with her mom across the Indiana border. The trek to get there and meet Dortha Schaefer (Laura Dern) and her gal friends marks the first time Evelyn has gone anywhere. Tuff (nickname of author Terry Ryan) asks her mom why shes put up living such a ""miserable life"" and the mothers stoic response is the films anthem for grit. A deception by the pathetic Kelly and a last-minute contest win by Evelyn that rescues the clan from dissolution feel too dramatic yet theres hardly a moment onscreen that doesnt ring of truth. Huge credit is due Moore in a fascinating performance that again shows shes among the best American actresses onscreen. Ever mindful she must keep up a good face for the kids Moores Evelyn rather than being a re-creation of 50s-style feminine selflessness is a character who knows her resourcefulness is the best way for her to fulfill her expected role in life. This makes the her rare emotional breakdowns all the more shattering. Harrelson with a limited range of options as little more than a drunken slob whos jealous of his wifes abilities soon grows tiresome. Dern makes a brief but charming impression and Porterfield in a striking debut crafts a beautiful role built on teen smarts. Andersons dalliances with tiny flights of fancy serve as visual contrasts to her deliberately plain direction which are confidently supported by Jonathan Freemans desaturated color lensing and a superb design team (production designer Edward T. McAvoy art director Andrew Stearn and costume designer Hala Bahmet) capturing the period in a way that feels fully lived in.
