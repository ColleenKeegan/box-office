Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There is a videotape that once watched causes its viewers to die seven days later. (No its not Bruce Willis The Kid.) That simple premise the stuff of urban legends that find malevolent possibilities in mundane items spawned a pop-culture phenomenon in Asia first via The Ring (a novel by Japanese author Koji Suzuki) then in a series of much-imitated films initiated by director Hideo Nakata. Now comes an American version that wrings the premise for every drop of suspense. In spite of the technological twists The Ring is at heart a classic ghost story and it knows it. It allows the horror to unfold out of a campfire-ready opening scene as two teenage girls exchange the story of the videotape while left alone in a seemingly peaceful house. The evening doesnt go well which prompts single mom and Seattle Post-Intelligencer reporter Naomi Watts to investigate. Her efforts lead her to a remote cabin and inevitably an unmarked videotape whose spooky contents could pass for unused dailies from Mulholland Dr. ""Very film school"" says unimpressed former flame Martin Henderson. While hes not far off the mark the images have an unsettling quality that portends the troubles to come. Revealing more would spoil a plot dependent on the slow revelation of details. Spelled out it sounds a bit banal anyway as most ghost stories do when removed from the creaks and fleeting visions of unspeakable horror that make them work. Expanding on the strong visual sense evinced in the otherwise mediocre The Mexican director Gore Verbinski creates an air of dread that begins with the first scene and never lets up subtly incorporating elements from the current wave of Japanese horror films along the way. He succeeds mostly through sleight of hand. When the shocks come they interrupt long stretches in which the camera lingers meaningfully as characters accumulate details that confirm what they already know What theyve seen will kill them and soon. As a marriage of big-budget filmmaking and old-fashioned scare tactics it easily ranks alongside last years The Others. And like that film The Ring features a heroine several cuts above the average scream queen Watts whose worldly facade is chipped away as the film progresses revealing an expression of ashen dread. Viewers made callous by too many cheap horror films may experience a similar reaction.

"Auto Focus is an anti-sex dirge. Slate Sign In Sign Up Auto Focus is an anti-sex dirge. Auto Focus is an anti-sex dirge. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 18 2002 212 PM Video Killed the TV Star Paul Schrader turns Auto Focus into an anti-sex dirge; The Ring adds ""Dont watch that tape"" By David Edelstein Wilson and Kinnear as the Cranes in more prudish times Almost every time I see a film by Paul Schrader I think about what a sensational subject he has gotten hold of and how I wish that someone else had stepped in to bring it to life. As a screenwriter hes drawn to volcanically conflicted protagonists but the movies he builds around them are austere even clinical. His script of Taxi Driver (1976) was a smashing success because Martin Scorsese a voluptuous Expressionist brought it to a boil It entered your bloodstream like a drug. Scorsese cooks; Schrader freeze-dries. I think his asceticism is meant to seem classical and contemplative (he once dismissed Taxi Driver as juvenilia) but it feels more like a failure of sympathetic imagination. He wont--or cant--go all the way. Advertisement In Auto Focus(Sony Pictures Classics) Schrader seems almost relieved to have as his protagonist a befuddled pipsqueak--a man who picks up a bad habit sinks into druggy depravity then leaves this world with no tragic awareness still clueless. The movie tells the story of Bob Crane (played by Greg Kinnear) the 60s sitcom actor from Hogans Heroes who was found bludgeoned to death in a hotel room in 1978. After the murder the press discovered that Crane led a shadow life that the other side of the glib sitcom hero was a man obsessed with documenting his hundreds of sexual conquests on film and video. Cranes afterlife has a neat element of drama too as documented in a recent New York Times Magazine article by Lynn Hirschberg The son from one marriage regards his fathers life as a sordid waste; the son from the other thinks his dad was a sexually liberated hero and has uploaded the hard-core films and tapes to a Web site for public consumption. (I would report on their quality but they kept crashing my Internet connection--there goes 3.95) It would have been a terrific idea to make a movie in which these two views were played off each other but Schrader--a confessed former porn addict--leans too far to one side to mine that rich dialectic. Auto Focus is a cautionary tale of addiction. What kills Crane it says is a lethal combination of sex video and celebrity Because of his fame he can go to bed with a different woman (or several) every night. And because the mid-60s marks the birth of a new technology--home video--and hes pals with a celebrity hanger-on named John Carpenter (a prodigiously cretinous Willem Dafoe) who works at Sony he can videotape his conquests and relive them whenever he wants to. Which is basically all the time. Kinnear Michael Rodgers and Willem Dafoe get nasty The movie starts out in a breezy style with lounge-lizard music (by Angelo Badalamenti) and a palette like 50s dinnerware--chartreuse turquoise dusty rose. But as Cranes addiction estranges him from his family and derails his career the camera gets shaky and the lighting harsh and the colors like the inside of a latrine. Crane leaves his first wife (Rita Wilson) for the actress who played Hilda on Hogans Heroes (Maria Bello) but he cant stay faithful to her either. In his last decade Crane hits the dinner-theater circuit looking more and more bloated and pathetic as he (along with Carpenter who shares the booty) trades on his celebrity to score. In one scene he spies a pair of attractive women and directs the bartender to switch the TV set to a channel with reruns of Hogans Heroes. Then he feigns amazement when hes recognized. The come-on actually works--Crane gets laid. But heres what you dont see in Auto Focus the pleasure of the act itself or any human tenderness in its aftermath. What was Crane like when the sex was over? A dismissive creep or a nice guy? Did he and these women ever talk? Was anything meaningful ever exchanged besides bodily fluids? Those of us who viewed the infamous Rob Lowe hotel-sex tape werent repulsed because hed gone to bed with a fan--I imagine there arent many celebrities major or minor who havent including Schrader--or even necessarily because he unceremoniously stood aside to let a pal of his get into the act. It was the total indifference displayed toward the woman. Schrader doesnt give us this crucial bit of information about Crane--maybe because Crane reportedly liked women and had fun with them. One of the creepiest things about this film is that the parade of females who go to bed with Crane seem more interchangeable--and more expendable--to the director than they do to the protagonist. Advertisement In an interview on National Public Radios Fresh Air Schrader told Terry Gross that Crane was obsessive-compulsive in other aspects of his life He didnt just catalog women and videotapes he cataloged things like his childrens games. Why isnt that in the movie? My guess is that Schrader found it too particular to Crane and too psychological. Schrader isnt interested in this one guy and his individual tics hes interested in the hellfire of sex plus video plus celebrity; so he treats Crane with a scientific condescension as a casualty of an overly permissive and enabling culture. You cant really moralize about obsessive-compulsive behavior. The Auto Focus script is credited to Michael Gerbosi (from a book by Robert Graysmith) but its godfathers are producers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski who wrote Ed Wood (1994) The People vs. LarryFlynt (1996) and Man on the Moon (1999)--biopics with a spoofy tone. (Even at their seediest the heroes of those films have a gee-whiz ingenuousness.) Their stance worked with Ed Wood--largely because Tim Burton had such sympathy for the protagonists awkward but earnest attempts at using Grade Z horror and science-fiction for self-expression. It bombed in Man on the Moon because the writers didnt attempt to divine the source of Andy Kaufmans aggression and because the director Milos Forman chose to package the story the way he packages everything--as the parable of a martyred nonconformist. Whats depressing about Auto Focus isnt its portrait of addiction its the mixture of insight-free facetiousness with Schraders chill severity. Kinnear and Dafoe are like loser swingers in a Saturday Night Live sketch. They make friendship look almost as unappetizing as sex. The casting makes the filmmakers intentions plain. In the Hogans Heroes re-creations Kinnear has the right shallow smirkiness (and Kurt Fuller gets Werner Klemperers rococo hamming as Col. Klink down cold). But in the last third Kinnear has no depths as an actor to plumb; even in the movies best scenes with Ron Leibman (in top form) as his brusque but softhearted agent he looks fatuously dazed. Youd never know that Crane had any gifts as a performer or that his Hogan was such a smart piece of characterization. The sitcom has a bad reputation for obvious reasons but apart from its Nazi context (OK thats a big ""apart from"") it had a solid comic counterculture premise It was about a laid-back American hipster making jackasses of the ""master race."" Crane was a perfect wise-guy hero for the mid-60s Breezy but with a beady eye on the main chance he radiated both sleaziness and supreme competence. He was as much a precursor to Alan Aldas Hawkeye Pierce in the TV version of MASH as Donald Sutherland was in the 1970 movie. But Schrader and Kinnear give him no stature as either a man or a performer. Auto Focus could be subtitled ""Diary of a superficial man."" In movies addiction is a tricky business. You dont want to glamorize it but if you start with too dire a picture you raise the question Why would anyone want to do this stuff in the first place? Im an admirer of films like Drugstore Cowboy (1989) and the first half of Requiem for a Dream (2000)--anti-addiction movies that nonetheless have sympathy for the ways in which people seek transcendence and end up enslaved. Theres no empathy in Schraders depiction of Bob Crane no attempt to understand what the man tried to get from sex and video. Schrader is like a reformed addict who isnt even honest enough to show what once gave him pleasure. Hes the most dangerous kind of crusader. In Auto Focus he makes you hate sex and movies equally. Advertisement The Japanese horror phenomenon Ring (1998) isnt much of a movie but it has a couple of eerie effects a blood-freezing climax and an irresistible premise Its about a videotape that kills you (we dont until the end know how) exactly seven days after you watch it. As Film Comment editor Gavin Smith says in an article I wrote in last Sundays New York Times its an old-fashioned curse picture with a clever high-tech twist It preys on our love/hate addiction to television. Ring takes video which has made horror feel safer than it did in the days before movies could be purchased at your local gas station and makes it dangerous again. The Ring A lethal movie Most Hollywood remakes of foreign hits lose 90 percent in translation but The Ring (DreamWorks) directed by Gore Verbinski from a script by Ehren Kruger loses only about 25 percent and mostly makes up for that with a few original flourishes and a fine turn by the yummy Naomi Watts (of Mulholland Drive [2001]). Watts plays an investigative journalist who watches the tape (as research) then has seven days to discover its origins to keep from turning into a screaming-skull corpse with pop-out eyes. The filmmakers have wisely stayed close to the originals mood which is somber and flat with quick (near-subliminal) inserts and a soundtrack full of watery-grave groans and murmurs. Theyve also come up with a killer dead-horse motif. The movie is meant to get into you like a virus and it does. Verbinski and Kruger have made the lethal video a shade literal for my taste In the Japanese version it was more abstract and hence more scarily irrational; here its imagery tells too much of a story. Along the same lines the climactic appearance of the wraith is in too-sharp focus. Leave it to the auto-focus-obsessed Japanese to realize that theres nothing more terrifying in the middle of the frame than a giant blur. Correction In last weeks Bowling for Columbine review I misstated the figures on gun possession in Canada versus the United States. We have three times more guns per capita than our neighbors in the Great White North. But we have way way more than three times the number of gun murders per year so Moores point (and mine) remains valid. The fact that Canadians have so many guns and didnt think to use them on Moore when he strolled up their front steps and into their unlocked houses says much about their national character--for better and worse.

"Horror film haunted by unanswered questions | CJOnline.com Toggle navigation Home News Local Business Sports Weather Subscribe Obits Classifieds Classifieds Local Jobs Homes Search Horror film haunted by unanswered questions The Ring Rated PG-13 for thematic elements disturbing images language and some drug references the film opens today at the West Ridge 8 Posted Friday October 18 2002 By By Christy LemireThe Associated Press ""The Ring"" about a videotape that kills people is so full of inconsistencies and plot holes that I stumbled from a recent screening with few answers and a ton of questions Photos If the tape really is a famous urban legend as the beginning of the movie states how does a teen-age girl (Amber Tamblyn) watch it with her friends without having heard about it and end up dead? Then if her newspaper reporter aunt Rachel (Naomi Watts) suspects that the tape kills people why does she watch it? (This one I know the answer to She is a horror flick heroine so she has to put herself in danger.) Once Rachel gets a breathy phone call warning her that she is going to die within seven days of watching the video why would she inflict the tape on her friend Noah (Martin Henderson) and doom him? (Wait I know the answer to this one too This is one of those movies in which the plot is pushed along by stupid people doing stupid things.) And why after accidentally watching the tape does Rachels son Aidan (David Dorfman) start receiving telepathic messages from a mysterious little girl who has been dumped down a well? Did he always have this talent or has he simply seen ""The Sixth Sense"" too many times? Once Rachel goes on a quest to solve the mystery of the tape why dont her editors call her to find out where she has been all week? In an early scene her boss threatens to fire her -- but why? Besides being a little surly -- and what journalist isnt -- what egregious offenses has she committed? On a foggy island off the coast of Seattle where Rachel ends up on her journey the locals (including the bottom-of-the-well girls doctor played by Jane Alexander) cryptically refer to how much better life is without the child around. We see her briefly in a psychiatric hospital but what could this kid possibly have done that is so horrible that she deserves to be dumped down a well? If the child has supernatural powers to produce a video without equipment and can call people to warn them they are going to die even though she has no phone why cant she get herself out of the well? And if she has the ability to send a video message why must it be a wannabe creepy montage that is a film-school rip-off of Luis Bunuels ""Un Chien Andalou""? Why not just say ""Hey guys Im down here"" instead of making people guess what happened to her through images of maggots ladders empty chairs and eyeballs? And a couple of the most baffling questions of all If the original version of this movie was such a huge hit in Japan why did director Gore Verbinski (""The Mexican"") and screenwriter Ehren Krueger (""Arlington Road"") have to remake it by cobbling together images from every other horror flick imaginable? There is the well from ""The Amityville Horror"" spooky telepathic kids from ""The Shining"" and deafening television snow from ""Poltergeist"" not to mention an apartment building homage to ""Rear Window."" And why did Watts choose this as the next movie she made after ""Mulholland Drive?"" Her stunning performance in last years David Lynch movie earned her well-deserved rave reviews. Her presence and instincts here help raise the movie ever so slightly but not enough.

Not very in the final though inconclusive analysis offered by Paul Schraders ""Auto Focus."" But were led to think otherwise for a good long time by Greg Kinnears eerily cheerful insightful performance as Bob Crane a star of the old TV series ""Hogans Heroes"" and a total stranger to his tortured self. (Hes a lost-soulmate of Barry Egan the dissociated hero of ""Punch-Drunk Love."") The real-life Crane played the title character of the hit comedy set in a German POW camp for six seasons between 1965 and 1971. Then he went into a professional and personal decline that ended with his squalid murder in 1978 in an apartment in Scottsdale Ariz. Mr. Kinnears Crane presents himself as the nicest guy and the most affable demi-celebrity youd ever want to meet -- bright-eyed smiley-faced a compulsive pleaser whose demeanor does manage to please. Secretly though hes addicted to predatory sex and pornography an obsession thats not merely shared but memorialized by his electronic Boswell John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe) a bisexual video technician who pops up periodically with the latest cameras or videotape recorders. Mr. Schrader no stranger to heedless obsession in such films as ""Obsession"" ""Hard Core"" and of course his classic ""Taxi Driver"" gives us two history lessons here -- in American sexual mores of the time and in audio-visual technology. As Cranes craving for sex grows Carpies video cameras keep shrinking. The title refers to Cranes narcissism a hollow state of being that cant be filled because it turns others into sexual or social appliances. Yet it turns us into restless onlookers whose curiosity cant be fulfilled since theres no inner man for us to discover. Michael Gerbosis script mixes sharp observations and pointed dialog with such schematic notions as Bob Cranes need to see women as madonnas or whores. And it grows repetitious both in its account of Cranes ritual behavior and in clumsily written -- and stolidly directed -- scenes between Crane and Carpenter two men acting out their own unacknowledged sexual drama. (I may have grown impervious to the relentless intensity of Mr. Dafoes recent work; I didnt like him in ""Spider-Man"" and I dont like him here.) But ""Auto Focus"" provides an enjoyable period evocation -- including several glimpses of ""Hogans Heroes"" -- and a memorable portrait by Mr. Kinnear. He has played nice guys before. This time the niceness is lethal. Real Women Have Curves Given the phenomenal popularity of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" a critic now disses old-fashioned ethnic comedy at his peril. I wont do that to ""Real Women Have Curves."" Patricia Cardosos debut feature has a good heart a pure spirit and a smart young Mexican-American heroine Ana Garcia (a newcomer named America Ferrera) who doesnt let a suffocating mother or a few extra pounds stand in the way of her success. Ana is so smart that she barely gets out of high school before being accepted to Columbia University with a full scholarship. But Columbia is in New York and Ana lives in Los Angeles where her traditional Hispanic mother played in boldface and italics by Lupe Ontiveros insists that she help out in her older sisters business a small-scale sweatshop that assembles expensive dresses at low profit for high-fashion clients. (While the shop is undeniably sweaty it seems to harbor a special heat -- dry I guess -- thats cheerfully tolerated by its female workers all of whom range from overweight to obese.) Ms. Ferrera is an engaging performer; you find yourself rooting for Ana from the start even though you know from the predictable script by George LaVoo and Josefina Lopez that rooting isnt required for a happy outcome. And given the phenomenal reach of obesity in our unfamished land ""Real Women Have Curves"" will find an appreciative audience for Anas hard-won self-esteem ""Theres so much more to me"" she says earnestly ""than just... just my weight."" Still I blanched at a funny scene when she incites her co-workers to throw off their own dresses and rejoice in their cellulite and stretch marks. ""Who cares what we look like when no ones watching us?"" she says as the camera gapes at vast expanses of surplus flesh. Its ""My Big Fat Mexican Sweatshop."" The Grey Zone Until Tim Blake Nelson made ""The Grey Zone"" a drama of Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz buying a few months time by helping their Nazi captors exterminate fellow Jews no feature film had depicted in quite such harrowing detail the death camp as charnel house. To its great credit Mr. Nelsons film not only does so but declines to aestheticize its stark vignettes of damp corpses piled high and ovens aflame. ""The Grey Zone"" -- the title turns out to mean more than moral confusion -- is based on a play by Mr. Nelson that in turn was partly based on the memoirs of Miklos Nyiszli a Hungarian Jewish doctor who used Jewish inmates for dubious experiments at the behest of the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. (Nyiszli is played compellingly by Allan Corduner.) Most of the film is devoted to the question of what people will do -- the people in this case being Jewish members of one Sonderkommando or ""special squad"" -- to prolong their own lives. (The answer one prisoner says is ""anything."") At the same time though some of the prisoners hatch a plot that will become the only armed revolt in Auschwitzs grisly history. Mr. Nelson clearly had no illusions about his film becoming popular entertainment; this is a pitch-dark portrait of humans struggling to survive inhuman circumstances. Yet ""The Grey Zone"" is weakened by a number of theatrical choices. To avoid silly accents the Hungarian prisoners played by American actors including David Arquette and Daniel Benzali speak colloquial American English. Fine but the result is inadvertent artifice and an emphasis on the silly German accent used by Harvey Keitel who is nonetheless effective as a German officer in charge of one crematorium. Some of the line readings carry overtones of David Mamet or the studied simplicity of Group Theatre-style naturalism from the 1930s. And a subplot about saving one little girls life is developed tentatively but intrusively. With all its flaws though ""The Grey Zone"" deserves to be respected and to be seen. Bloody Sunday A terrible air of fatefulness suffuses ""Bloody Sunday"" Paul Greengrasss stunning re-creation of the day in September 1972 when 13 unarmed civilians were killed by British soldiers during a peace march in Northern Ireland. Thirty years later the bloodbath is still surrounded by controversy so the film cant be taken as a definitive factual account. Yet it makes a powerful case for the contention that 3000 British paratroopers presumably sent to keep the peace were looking for a fight when they arrived and that their contingency plan was nothing more than a sequence of ghastly blunders waiting to happen. In a cast that mixes professional actors with nonprofessionals many of them ex-soldiers James Nesbitt plays Ivan Cooper the Protestant MP who organized the march as a nonviolent demonstration; Tim Pigott-Smith is the British commander Maj. Gen. Ford. I found the dialog hard to understand at many points partly because of the accents and partly because of the chaotic clamor on both sides -- the hard-faced paras with no regrets and the hotheaded boys with not a notion of the whirlwind they would reap. Amid the chaos though its easy to discern the tragedys roots naivete and recklessness on the part of the marchers and hangers-on bad faith and appalling incompetence on the part of military men who ought to have known better. ""Bloody Sunday"" is a harrowing lesson in unintended -- and intended -- consequences. The Ring ""The Ring"" a horror flick starring Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson tells of a mysterious videotape that kills those who watch it. Recycled from a Japanese hit this film is too besotted by its own fancy imagery to tell the tale with any coherence; its about as scary as those postcard reminders of overdue Blockbuster tapes. Gore Verbinski whose last film was the singularly scatter-brained ""The Mexican"" directed from a fractured screenplay by Ehren Kruger. Mr. Verbinski came to feature films from a hugely successful career directing commercials; I guess you could see this one as a commercial for discontinuity -- seemingly endless shots borrowed from Dali Bunuel or early David Lynch of such surreal icons as a lighthouse a ladder a squiggly centipede or a horses eye. (There is also to be fair one rousing sequence involving a rampaging horse on a ferryboat.) Watching ""The Ring"" wont kill you but it could bore you half to death.  VIDEO TIP Paul Schrader made his directorial debut with ""Blue Collar"" (1978) working from a script he wrote with his brother Leonard. Theres plenty of gloom to go around in this story of three men fed up with their lives as autoworkers in Detroit; Mr. Schrader has never pretended to be peddling light comedy. But the stars give extraordinary performances Yaphet Kotto as a decent fun-loving ex-con; Richard Pryor as an angry family man; and Harvey Keitel as their improvident white friend.

With Naomi Watts Martin Henderson Brian Cox. Directed by Gore Verbinski. Running time 109 mins. Rated PG-13 drug and alcohol content sexuality some violence and language. 1 1/2 Stars. The imagination of Salvador Dali meets the supernatural hustle of M. Night Shyamalan in Gore Verbinskis ""The Ring"" a horror ghost story that figures to become a cult film for the video generation. I hated it but I grant that it does tap into a vein of technological horror - the fear of the VCR - that will have young videophiles chatting it up for weeks. Its already generating ""Blair Witch"" buzz on the Internet. Adapted from both a series of Japanese novels and the Japanese film TV and comic-book franchise they spawned ""The Ring"" is certainly the strangest movie to come out of a Hollywood studio (DreamWorks) this year. Its an art-house B movie with philosophical pretensions a murky story line and a disturbing sequel-promising ending. A terrific lead performance from Aussie actress Naomi Watts who emerged as a potential star in David Lynchs ""Mulholland Drive"" is about the only thing I enjoyed about it. Watts plays Rachel Keller a Seattle newspaper reporter and single mom whose investigation into the death of a teenage niece puts her and her young sons life in jeopardy. In the films long tease opening the niece dies of a heart attack exactly seven days after watching a strange videotape and receiving a telephone call giving her a week to live. Ace reporter that she is Rachel retraces her nieces steps to a wooded motel cabin where she finds the haunted video and pops it into the VCR for her own viewing pleasure. Its a weird symbolism-rich short something youd see at a festival of bad student films with Dali-esque images suggesting family tragedy on a horse farm next to the sea. Having received her ""death call"" Rachel enlists the aid of Noah (New Zealander Martin Henderson) a video expert who happens to be her ex-boyfriend and the father of her psychic son Aidan (David Dorfman). Of course he watches it and gets a telephone call himself. Then Aidan after sneaking a peek in the middle of a sleepless night gets his call. ""The Ring"" follows Rachel and Noah as they race the clock to deconstruct the video and take away its power. Their clues are provided mostly by Aidan who is channeling the ghost of a young girl in the video. Verbinski - who directed the Brad Pitt/Julia Roberts fiasco ""The Mexican"" - is a fine visual stylist and ""The Ring"" shot in the rain and mist of the Pacific Northwest is deftly atmospheric and genuinely creepy. The editing full of quick cuts and foreboding is hip enough for a music video. While ""The Ring"" is a contextual dead ringer for the recent ""FearDotCom"" (sub the video with a Web site) the movie it most resembles in spirit is David Cronenbergs far superior ""Videodrome"" about a late-night TV program that infects the minds of its viewers. The hallucinatory quality of that films imagery continues to haunt me in ways ""The Ring"" never will. But the subsequent video revolution deserves its own benchmark horror film which the Japanese version ""Ringu"" is among Asians and which Verbinskis could become in the West. ""Ringu"" by the way screens next weekend at the Walter Reade Theater as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center series ""Scary Movies 30 Years of Horror"" which begins today.

Comments (1) The Ring 109 minutes Four Seattle teenagers die exactly one week after watching an eerie experimental video and receiving phone calls that predict their deaths. A newspaper reporter (Naomi Watts) and her boyfriend (Martin Henderson) watch the same video and try to get to the bottom of the mystery. But either theres no bottom or this 2002 movie lost me long before it got there. A remake of Ringu a Japanese film by Hideo Nakata that I wish Id seen instead this moodless version is pushed along by the slick and mechanical direction of Gore Verbinski (Mouse Hunt The Mexican) and a by-the-numbers script by Ehren Kruger (Scream 3). Its a treasure hunt reduced to isolated jolts and more clues than you can shake a stick at (every fly on the wall and childs drawing bristles with unholy significance) and an utter waste of Watts; theres not a trace here of the talent on display in Mulholland Drive perhaps because the script doesnt bother to give her a character.

""The Ring"" is a stylish Hollywood remake of the Japanese horror sensation that unfortunately has little personality of its own. Insinuating creepiness of this tale of a bizarre videotape that brings death to those who watch it comes across in muted fashion with uninvolving characters and lack of genuine excitement or fright creating a second-rate second-hand feel. DreamWorks release could fill a need as a Halloween season scare item in the absence of anything similar in the marketplace but looks unlikely to spawn two follow-ups as the Japanese original did. A rather ordinary picture artistically apart from its arresting premise the Nipponese ""The Ring"" directed by Hideo Nakata and based on a novel by Koji Suzuki (the so-called Stephen King of Japan) became one of the biggest domestic grossers of all time after its release in January 1998. Huge in other Asian markets as well such as Hong Kong it was followed by ""The Ring 2"" another smash also helmed by Nakata and finally by ""Ring 0 The Birthday"" a prequel directed by Norio Tsuruta in 2001. Unnerving quality of the original surely had something to do with the universal consciousness of the invasiveness of television and the telephone in everyday lives as well as with the irresistibility of both inventions; if a TV is on its almost impossible not to look at it and if the phone rings its hard not to answer it. Both impulses are central to the way ""The Ring"" old and new grab viewer attention at the very outset. Hanging out alone one night teenage best friends Katie and Becca share what they know about a weird video thats been making the rounds of high school circles. Turns out Katie and her b.f. saw it during an illicit visit to a mountain cabin a week earlier then got a phone call informing them that they will die in seven days. Separately Katie Josh and two other teens meet untimely ends that night spurring Katies aunt newspaper reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) to investigate the case. Single mom Rachel has an odd little son Aidan (David Dorfman) who has recently taken to drawing pictures featuring buried bodies which momentarily introduces a ""Sixth Sense"" element that ultimately amounts to a red herring. Making her way to the remote cabin Rachel finds the video and watches it with appropriate trepidation. The black-and-white tape is like an intense but maddeningly obscure surrealist short featuring a collection of stark and seemingly unrelated images including those of a stern-looking middle-aged woman a centipede an old house and the woman dumping the body of a girl into a well. Then comes the dreaded ""seven days"" call. Director Gore Verbinski handles the setup in quiet understated fashion the ominous mood strengthened by the wet overcast Seattle-area weather. Feeling of an inexorable oppressive force closing in is furthered by the ticking clock that now hangs over Rachels life in that she is now convinced that she has but a week to learn enough about the tape its source and its lethal power to prevent her death. But as the film slips more into procedural mode with Rachel enlisting the aid of Aidans dad Noah (Martin Henderson) a skeptical video expert the knitting holding the yarn together begins to fray and show its weakness; the leads that enable Rachel to pursue the case are often implausibly discovered and connected timelines and logistics dont convince and the principal characters reveal themselves as conventional one-dimensional types of no distinction quirks or special interest. While scenarist Ehren Kruger has added a few dramatic wrinkles of his own to the Japanese version hes crucially neglected to give the characters anything to play other than to react as average people would to adverse circumstances. When first seen in her newspaper office Rachel appears to be on the brink of being fired until she informs her editor of the teen deaths story shes working on. Why was she about to be canned? Is she an unreliable reporter? Is she too stressed by being a single working mom to handle the demands of her job? Is she sleeping with her boss son? We never learn why which doesnt matter in and of itself though it does reflect the fact that we know absolutely nothing about this woman and therefore have no way to engage with her as a character except as a standard-issue woman-in-peril. This goes double for the character of Noah. Therefore in her much-anticipated first starring role since her startling and fabulous performance in ""Mulholland Drive"" Watts has been straightjacketed into a role that gives her nothing to play other than attempted resourcefulness under duress. To make matters worse Verbinski and lenser Bojan Bazelli neither of them slouches when it comes to visual style dont find a way to photograph her to maximum advantage until about an hour in when having discovered some of the videos secrets Rachel visits an island farm and has a dodgy encounter with a difficult older man (Brian Cox). Latter-going which clarifies many aspects of the contents of the video but still doesnt begin to explain everything thats happened in the film is more elaborated than in the Japanese original. Thesping is unexceptional across the board while craft elements are fine with special kudos to the Method Studios for creating the compellingly mysterious Ring video as well as visual effects of which Charles Gibson was supervisor. Rick Baker delivers some convincingly bruised battered and decomposed makeup effects. Pic emerges in the end as a low-impact suspenser that sustains a certain mood but doesnt approach the full potential of its premise.

We soon find out its no legend and Gore Verbinskis horror movie--a Hollywood remake of the immensely popular 1998 Japanese movie ""Ringus"" which spawned two Japanese sequels--shifts into solemn gear and starts to raise some serious goose bumps. You know the movie is going to be stylish from the videotape itself which you watch through the eyes of reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) the aunt of one of four teenagers who died a week after watching the tape. A disturbing black-and-white surrealist nightmare--filled with blood severed fingers centipedes and a woman hurling herself off the edge of a cliff--the videos images will supply the clues Rachel must follow as she rushes against time to save herself her ex (Martin Henderson) and her strange sixth-sensible son (David Dorfman) from a horrible end. This demonic ghost story is stronger on mood than character. The more the mysterious pieces fall into place the less sense ""The Ring"" makes. But most horror fans will happily sacrifice coherence and plausibility for some good otherworldly jolts. Elegantly shot by Bojan Bazelli and designed by Tom Duffield with a chilling Hans Zimmer score this visually stunning movie serves up generous dollops of designer creepiness.

"The Ring Is Incoherent Chilling-And Naomi Watts Looks Great | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters The Ring Is Incoherent Chilling-And Naomi Watts Looks Great By Andrew Sarris  10/28/02 1200am Gore Verbinskis The Ring  from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger is not some Wagnerian operatic film as its title might suggest but rather a remake of a 1998 box-office bonanza of a Japanese horror film entitled Ringu  directed by Hideo Nakata from a book by Koji Suzuki who is celebrated as the Stephen King of Japan. Ive never seen the Japanese version but I have read that Mr. Verbinskis English-language remake retains the two modern inventions serving as instruments of fear and shock in the original a telephone with the loudest and most jarring rings you are ever likely to hear on any soundtrack and the fateful and fatal videocassette that condemns anyone watching it to die in seven days. One can only speculate about the malignant associations that Japanese audiences are prepared to attribute to such modern intrusions into their ancient culture as telephones and videocassettes which serve as the tools of evil avengers from the land of the dead. In this respect Mr. Verbinskis production of The Ring probably received the green light from the financial powers-that-be on the basis of the phenomenal international commercial success of M. Night Shyamalans The Sixth Sense (1999) which like The Ring  asks us to believe that the dead can come back to haunt us from the grave. Come to think of it there was a crucial videocassette in The Sixth Sense as well. Unfortunately The Ring is not nearly as coherent and consistent as The Sixth Sense  which finally did make some internal sense in that the end did not contradict everything that had gone before. By contrast Mr. Verbinski and Mr. Kruger seem to make up new rules as they go along with the result that at the final fade-out we are left hanging able to figure out neither what else is about to happen nor exactly what has already happened and who is responsible for it. Still I found The Ring moderately absorbing largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound for which I must thank the direction of Mr. Verbinski the cinematography of Bojan Bazelli theproductiondesignofTom Duffield the editing of Craig Wood the costume design of Julie Weiss the music by Hans Zimmer the visual-effects supervision of Charles Gobson and the ghastly and ghostly special makeup effects by the renowned Rick Baker. But lets face it These days Ill go to anything with rising star Naomi Watts in it. Here she does not disappoint though her role as Rachel a perpetually overwrought investigative journalist and single mother is hardly worthy of the break-out talents she displayed in David Lynchs Mulholland Drive (2001). Nonetheless she gives a charmingly good-sport Ill-scream-on-cue performance to jolly things along. She is handicapped somewhat by having to tend to David Dorfmans inadequately calibrated performance as Aidan a creepy child character shamelessly patterned after Haley Joel Osments uncanny turns in both The Sixth Sense and Steven Spielbergs A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). The Ring begins with two teenage friends Katie (Amber Tamblyn) and Becca (Rachael Bella) hanging out in an unattended home and schmoozing about a mysterious tape that Katie had seen with her boyfriend Josh a week before after which the phone rang and Katie was told that she would die in seven days. The phone rings again after Becca has left Katie alone downstairs and as we later learn Katie dies mysteriously with a ghoulishly contorted expression of horror on her face. We learn that Katies boyfriend Josh has also died just as mysteriously as have another teenage couple-all four deaths supposedly following the showing of the mysterious tape. For her part Becca is trundled off to an insane asylum after having discovered Katies body the next morning. After all this hullabaloo Ms. Watts Rachel Katies aunt enters the scene to attend her nieces funeral and listen to her sisters plea that she get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding all four fatalities. Rachel is initially skeptical of the videotape rumor but when she accidentally discovers the tape and proceeds to screen it the phone rings and her death sentence is pronounced for seven days hence. What alarms her even more is that her son has stumbled upon the tape and seen it too-and even more ominously knows much more about Katies death than all the grownups. Suddenly gripped by constant hysteria Rachel calls upon Noah (Martin Henderson) her former lover and Aidans father to help her solve the puzzle. Noah has always been level-headed as well as an expert in all forms of electronic communications though also a bit too cynical and irresponsible for Rachels taste. All this character information is imparted on the fly amid innumerable ringings of the phone and screenings of the tape with its signature opening of a ""ring"" consisting of two ominously concentric circles which is eventually shown to represent a well cover concealing an old crime that is the key to the mystery. The pacing remains frantically kinetic with the camera huffing and puffing to keep up with terrified humans fleeing from or rushing toward the frightening unknown. As the contents of the tape are explored for clues to the mortal curse a strange spectacle of crazed horses on a horse farm owned by Richard and Anne Morgan (Brian Cox and Shannon Cochran) begins to dominate the screen. Madness spreads like a plague from the Morgans to their horses and to their hallucinatory daughter Samara a name with an Arabic connotation of death. Through this maze more metaphysical than metaphorical Rachel soldiers on with Noah at her side until the horror engulfs them both. Could this be a parable about the mind-numbing violence and psychosis of the times in which we live and die as if we were all accursed? Perhaps Ive seen one ""down"" movie too many and The Ring is it. I should add that Jane Alexander as Dr. Grasnik makes a late but welcome entrance to clarify and stabilize the tottering narrative but she is soon gone and the film is left free to plunge into chaos. Ambitious Gay Love Ventura Pons Food for Love  from David Leavitts novel The Page Turner  is one of many recent movies with explicitly gay protagonists involved in various stages of soft-core seduction and promiscuity. We have come a long way from the days more than a century ago when homosexuality of the male variety was synonymous with decadence and depravity in plays like The Green Bay Tree and novels like The Servant . I stress the ""male variety"" of gayness because there seems to be a double standard for straight males when it comes to watching two men perform on the screen ( ugh ) as opposed to two women ( ahh ). Perhaps the former is more threatening than the latter. After all guys have enough problems what with all the current psychobabble about homoeroticism in the most sacred male group activities and buddy relationships. As for Food for Love  I havent read Mr. Leavitts novel nor seen any of Mr. Pons previous films and I dont know the burgeoning category of gay and lesbian cinema as well as I might or should. But I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject-if indeed gayness is the subject of Food for Love  interwoven as it is with the themes of careerism in the classical-music world and the painful relationship between a gay son and his square mother. Kevin Bishop plays Paul Porterfield an 18-year-old hunk of a piano student given the opportunity to serve as a page-turner for his idol world-famous pianist Richard Kennington (Paul Rhys) at the peak of his career professionally but on the decline emotionally. Paul is accompanied everywhere by his ditheringly devoted and ambitious mother Pamela Porterfield (the marvelously overqualifiedJuliet Stevenson) whose unseen husband is about to leave her for another woman as the film begins causing her to cling ever more tenaciously to her son. The absence of a father figure in Pauls life provides what little motivation of the Penguin-edition Freud variety there is in Pauls intense infatuation with Kennington and his own gay promiscuity. At Kenningtons concert Paul is first approached by Joseph Mansourian (Allan Corduner) Kenningtonsmiddle-aged agent and long-time lover. Paul deflects Mansourians advances and seemingly concentrates on letting himself be seduced by Kennington. Suddenly the action shifts fromSanFranciscoto Barcelona (instead of Rome as in the book) where Paul and Pamela are sightseeing when Paul discovers that Kennington has just given a concert in the city. Paul rushes to the pianists hotel and resumes their affair. Pamela assumes that Paul and Kennington are just friends with a mutual passion for music. But Kennington soon tires of Paul and his mother as a steady social diet and returns suddenly like the creature of impulse he is to his home base in New York. When Paul starts Juilliard he is soon heartbroken to discover that he is not talented enough to become a concert pianist but he finally resigns himself to a humbler existence and a genuinely closer and more honest relationship with his mother who at last accepts her son for what he is by telling him the mythological story of Ganymede as a sign of her enlightenment. I cant help thinking that these gay themes are treated more persuasively in the insightful HBO series Six Feet Under  simply because gay characters are seen more realistically as part of a predominantly straight world. Even so the melodious msuic of Food for Love almost justifies the titles invocation of the opening benediction by Orsino in Shakespeares Twelfth Night . Vintage Clouzot Henri-Georges Clouzots Quai des Orfevres (1947) from a screenplay by Clouzot (1907-1977) and Jean Ferry based on the novel Legitime Defense by Stanislas A. Steeman was released in New York in 1948 under the gamier title of Jenny Lamour  but was never taken seriously over here because the genre prejudices of the time decreed that a film noir or policier or detective-story musical-all of which Clouzots opus can claim to be-lacked sufficient social significance to qualify as a serious form of cinematic expression. Looking at this flick today one can surmise that Clouzot was a little bit ahead of his time in some respects and very much of his time in others. For example Clouzots pre-Marshall Plan Paris was still suffering from food shortages as reflected by a characters receiving some black-market liquid butter in a clandestine operation. Most of the action takes place at night inasmuch as the milieu is one of nightclubs with circus acts as well as late-night love nests. Louis Jouvets Detective-Lieutenant Antoine is investigating the murder of a lecherous ""producer"" named Brignon (Charles Dullin). The main suspect is Maurice Martineau (Bernard Blier father of director Bertrand Blier) husband and piano accompanist for his sexy songbird Marguerite Martineau a.k.a. Jenny Lamour her stage name. Aside from leading Brignon on to secure a movie contract-and thus making her husband insanely jealous-Jenny is openly adored by her best friend the lesbian photographer Dora Monier (Simone Renant). This was scorchingly hot stuff for Production Code-controlled Hollywood in 1948 as was Antoines little African boy the only result of his colonial duties as a former Foreign Legionnaire of which he remains proud. Lesbianism and miscegenation Call the Legion of Decency The mystery isnt much and the songs arent much more. Suzy Delair is now almost completely forgotten and she doesnt even indulge in one of the brazen topless scenes with which French filmmakers were already teasing their audiences way back in the 1930s. Still Quai des Orfevres is vintage Clouzot dark gloomy and misanthropic with casually sadistic police-interrogation scenes that remind us still that the Paris police have always made an Okefenokee swamp sheriff over here look like a member of the ACLU. The Film Forum is to be congratulated for bringing this fun movie classic back to our attention.

The sweet glow of success for Naomi Watts Ring has hang-up or twoBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Ring starts with a winningly chilling premise and provides some eerie jolts but ultimately it stops short of being truly effective. Aspiring in the psychological-thriller vein of The Exorcist and The Omen it creates a gloomy and disturbing mood set in the gray Pacific Northwest. But as The Ring weaves to an end too many threads are left dangling and the movie ultimately proves too implausible to put alongside those horror classics. We willingly enter The Ring based on the Japanese supernatural thriller Ringu when a teenage girl tells another an urban legend about a videotape of unsettling images that when watched leads to the viewers gruesome death. As the story goes after anyone watches the tape the phone rings and the caller predicts that the viewer will die in seven days. More on the movie The Ring (out of four) Stars Naomi Watts Martin Henderson David Dorfman Brian Cox Daveigh Chase Director Gore Verbinski Distributor DreamWorks Rating PG-13 for disturbing images language A skeptical reporter played capably by Naomi Watts gets on the case after her teenage niece mysteriously dies on the same night that three other youths die of unexplained causes. Watts appears to be investigating the videotape for a Seattle newspaper but as she gets more embroiled her assignment falls by the wayside and no mention is made again of a news story or deadlines. Perhaps thats because she has a more urgent deadline to contend with. She has watched the tape and has only seven days to unravel its clues or she too will die. She enlists the help of an ex (Martin Henderson) to help untangle the mystery and save her life and that of her 6-year-old son (David Dorfman). The boy has some sort of prescient or telepathic powers that come to light in the wake of his cousins death but they remain unexplained. He hears dead people (receiving messages from some of those killed) though its unclear why he has been chosen -- other than because hes a sensitive lad and conveniently the protagonists son. The mystery is linked to a horsewoman who lived in a remote part of the Northwest. Watts locates the womans taciturn widower (Brian Cox) even though in the video she appeared to be from the 18th century. This is one of several attempts to confuse and obfuscate. One wishes director Gore Verbinski had focused more on making our skin crawl. At times the suspense is palpable but by the end theres a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential.

Directed by Gore Verbinski from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger. 115 minutes. PG-13 for thematic elements disturbing images language and some drug references. Several theaters. What do you do if a terrifying videotape thats circulating falls into your hands? Easy You remake it for 60 million add ""The"" to the title and remove much of the subtlety that made the 1998 ""Ring"" a phenomenon in Japan and a pass-along cult hit here. Following up her breakthrough in David Lynchs ""Mulholland Drive"" last year Naomi Watts plays driven Seattle Post-Intelligencer reporter Rachel Keller. (Apparently reporters at our competition get away with calling their editors some unprintably alliterative names.) Shes drawn into an unsettling mystery when her niece dies in what seems like a schlocky urban legend The niece watched a cursed videotape and the friend who discovered her body has been institutionalized. Perhaps you thought Blockbusters policies were harsh. Everyone who sees the tape immediately gets a phone call warning them that theyll die in seven days. The doomed peoples faces are blurred in photos taken after theyve watched the tape. And at the end of the week theyre found dead faces frozen in grimaces of terror. It starts like disposably familiar teen horror -- scripted by ""Scream 3s"" Ehren Kruger -- but quickly becomes an atmospheric and very spooky supernatural mystery. Rachel finds the motel cabin in the woods where her niece watched the tape with friends. Theyre all dead too. But she cant overcome her curiosity and she watches it. The phone call comes. Now in a race against time to lay the curse to rest she shows it to her skeptical videographer ex-boyfriend (Martin Henderson). Meanwhile her young son (David Dorfman) has begun to have disturbing visions that may be coming from the dead niece. Clues lead Rachel from perpetually gloomy Seattle to a stormswept fictional Puget Sound island where an angry widower (Brian Cox) lives with an unbearable secret. ""The Ring"" shows surprising restraint for an American remake effective atmosphere from cinematographer Bojan Bazelli good acting from Watts and some nice surprises -- all without much blood and gore. Yet director Gore Verbinski (""The Mexican"" ""Mouse Hunt"") just cant adhere to the stillness of Hideo Nakatas original. Without spoiling the rest I can tell you that supernatural enhancements -- such as ghostly puddles and making Rachels son a ""Sixth Sense"" type -- are the equivalent of telegraphing a KO punch with a big windup. They diminish the storys signature whopper of a scene one so memorable and skillful that it jolts even the most jaded fright aficionados. Like director Christopher Nolans remake of the Norwegian thriller ""Insomnia"" it makes the tantalizingly implicit explicit overexplains for spoon-feeding purposes. Thats the difference between a good chiller -- which ""The Ring"" is especially compared with the idiot fodder that passes for American horror these days -- and an instant classic which ""Ring"" was. If you can get your nails on a tape of that one which inexplicably hasnt been released on video here youll get a real eye-opener. Mark Rahner 206-464-8259 or mrahnerseattletimes.com.

Starring Naomi Watts Martin Henderson and Brian Cox. Written by Ehren Kruger. Directed by Gore Verbinski. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Who knew there were so many dead people with an agenda? When we go to a thriller these days we get a chore list from these busybodies. They want us to solve mysteries find murder weapons and right wrongs. You should be warned however that the working stiff in ""The Ring"" has more in mind than tidying up a few loose ends. And thats all you need to know about that. The premise of ""The Ring"" a remake of a wildly popular Japanese thriller called ""Ringu"" has the sound of a familiar urban legend you somehow never heard. The idea is if you watch a weird disturbing videotape seven days later you die. Imagine if you forget to rewind. It isnt hard to picture the script pitch meeting. Well get some teenagers theyll watch the video it will be raining all the time and there will be lots of tiptoeing up and down stairs in dark houses. Oh yeah and we release it right before Halloween. And in fact there is an element of formula. All your favorites are here the creepy big-eyed kid who whispers freaky predictions the phone call that makes you jump the dripping ghost and the farmhouse with a secret. Related Stories VIDEO OF THE WEEK / Watch this video at your own expense / The Ring thrills with killer images But this is better than that. In fact ""The Ring"" is so good its scary. What you really want to know when you go to a chiller like this is Whats the ewwwwww factor? Is this going to give you a shiver of adrenaline or be so gross and graphic that it will put you off spaghetti for weeks? Lets put it this way -- you can still book dinner reservations after ""The Ring."" This is definitely a directors film. The actors hit their marks and are appropriately shocked at the proper moments but it is Gore Verbinskis deft touch that keeps this from turning into schlock. Verbinski is wise enough to know that in a thriller less is more. There are some genuine spill-the-popcorn moments but there are many more clever false alarms. We see a long ominous hallway over a characters shoulder. She opens the refrigerator door hiding the hallway. She closes the door and there in the hall is . . . nothing. The original Japanese film was based on a series of novels by Koji Suzuki who became known as the ""Stephen King of Japan"" after ""Ringu"" became a phenomenon. As handled by Verbinski the action clicks along without a wasted second. We get a shock right off the bat when two teenage girls -- out of the ""Addams Family"" house of fashion -- have a horrible experience with the consequences of watching the tape. The aunt of one of the girls Rachel (Naomi Watts ""Mulholland Drive"") is an investigative reporter. She decides to look into the case. She finds the video watches it without a moment of hesitation -- Nooooooooo -- and immediately gets a phone call announcing that she has seven days to live. Thats the deal. You watch the phone rings and in a week you die. Just that quickly this nasty little clockwork plot is off and running. Rachel and her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson ""Windtalkers"") have a week to solve the mystery of the tape and the suspense is only compounded when Rachel realizes that she has allowed others to view the tape before she realized how dangerous it was. Rachel and Noah are frantic of course but there are moments of dark humor. When the phone rings for the seven days warning Rachel lets the answering machine pick it up. Then she deletes the message. Nice try. ""The Ring"" keeps you squirming right up until the end -- and then a little after that. This is a Yogi Berra thriller -- it is really never over until it is over. The final payoff shocker will have you talking when you leave the theater. Especially when someone in your group remembers that you saw the video too -- when you watched the movie.

Story Tools RELATED  EW.COM Review The Ring intrigues  EW.COM All about Naomi Watts (CNN) -- A videotape that kills you seven days after you see it is that the center of the psychological thriller ""The Ring."" Based on ""Ringu"" (1998) one of the most successful films in Japanese history ""The Ring"" is more eerie and spooky than it is out-and-out scary -- but oh is it effective. Think ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) meets David Lynch -- then pretend that ""Blair Witch"" was even half as frightening as it was hyped up to be. Naomi Watts -- who starred in Lynchs ""Mulholland Drive"" -- plays Rachel Keller a reporter for a Seattle newspaper whose teenage niece dies mysteriously. After finding out that three other teenagers also suddenly died at exactly the same time and that all four had viewed a strange videotape seven days earlier she begins to investigate. Is the story about the videotape just another urban legend? Or is it the real thing? REVIEW ARCHIVES  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.COM  Movie reviews Unfortunately rather than finding the story she becomes the story after she her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) and her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) all view the tape in question. The clock is now ticking seven days until they die. Not a good career move. Whispering boo Highly stylized and visually stunning ""The Ring"" directed by Gore Verbinski sucks you in slowly then whispers ""boo"" in your ear just when you least expect it. The highly evocative story is greatly enhanced by Bojan Bazellis brilliant cinematography including the actual video itself. (Yes you do get to see the video in the film. No you wont die. At least I dont think you will.) Watts has had a much longer road to fame and fortune then her best friend and fellow Australian Nicole Kidman. She is excellent in this leading role which proves that her stellar performance in ""Mulholland Drive"" was not a fluke. She strikes a perfect balance between skepticism and the slow realization of the truth in regard to the deadly power of the videotape. Henderson does a wonderful job playing the devils advocate challenging Rachels theories at every turn. ""The Ring"" is most definitely Watts film from beginning to end but Henderson does an admirable job as the second banana to her showy role. Young Dorfman who played Gwyneth Paltrows son in ""Bounce"" (2000) is completely believable in his small but pivotal role. Brian Cox also offers a well crafted turn as Richard Morgan the man at the center of the mystery surrounding the fatal video. Chill factors Screenwriter Ehren Kruger no relation to Freddie is familiar with spooky topics. His writing credits include the thriller ""Arlington Road"" (1999) starring Jeff Bridges as well as ""Scream 3"" (2000) featuring David Arquette and Courtney Cox. Krugers script begins almost like another version of the ""Scream"" series with two girls exchanging scary stories. But the tension kicks in quite quickly when their spooky fiction turns into fact. Also inherent to the chill factor of this story is the fact that almost everyone has an unlabeled videotape lying around somewhere. Add the fact that the people who see the tape know they have only seven days to live (they receive a phone call right after viewing) and the atmosphere gets downright claustrophobic. There is little violence and no blood in this creepy thriller. Its truly a fascinating mind game that twists and turns itself into your subconscious. You may not be screaming your head off or hiding under your seat during this film but youll find it will linger in your mind long after you leave the theater. Oh and there is also a nice little twist at the end. Dont leave the theater too early or youll be sorry. ""The Ring"" opens nationwide on Friday and is rated PG-13.

It even starts like a teen slasher film with two girls in a spooky house giggling about naughty subjects. The opening segment ends on an unsettling note however. Were presented with a mystery -- its less comfortingly familiar than a goon in a hockey mask -- and The Ring starts to look like something we havent seen 100 times already. Or maybe we have. Its just that weve seen it in bits and pieces scattered among a half dozen or so better movies. Based on a 1998 Japanese film that became one of that countrys highest grossing movies ever The Ring is by definition unoriginal. But though it is often eerily effective the most interesting parts all are ... well lets call them homages to other films. Its got a simple premise that draws on the irresistible appeal of urban legend A videotape is making the rounds. Anyone who watches it gets a frightening telephone call. For the next seven days strange things happen. Then they die. Rachel Keller a Seattle newspaper reporter was the aunt of one of the girls in the opening scene. Four teens had watched the tape together and all four died the same night a week later. Rachel begins to investigate. She watches the tape then shows it to an old boyfriend Noah. Her young son Aidan also sneaks a peek. Rachels inquiry becomes a race against time. With building tension the film counts off the days until Rachel is slated to die. The story occasionally makes little sense but the mystery and the chills override the confusion. Eventually a powerful admonition about the treatment of children emerges from the muddled story line. Early in the story Rachel is late to pick Aidan up from school and barely listens when his teacher advises her to talk with him about whats on his mind. An unloved child turns out to be central to the mystery of the videotape. When Noah first watches the tape he describes it as ""very student film."" Its true Whoever made it clearly studied Un Chien Andalou Luis Bunuels disturbing 1929 surrealist collaboration with Salvador Dali. This is but one classic movie that director Gore Verbinski draws on. The Ring also occasionally resembles The Exorcist in its detached approach and tone as well as in its tightly wound and uncuddly mother figure. Rachel is played by Naomi Watts an Australian actress who was impressive last year in Mulholland Drive David Lynchs surrealistic thriller that this film also occasionally mimicks. Additionally echoes of The Sixth Sense are most obvious in the character of Aidan who says he receives messages from ghosts. These all are great films. Its hard to think of better spooky movies to borrow from. This grafted-together ghost story is too uneven to rank with them but it is genuinely unnerving -- a thought-provoking horror film that packs a visceral wallop. While its more surrealistic touches draw upon primal fears the film also inventively turns everyday objects such as televisions and videotape cassettes into instruments of horror. If I hadnt seen the more straightforwardly effective Below a few days earlier I mightve been as frightened by The Ring as other people seem to be. Images from the movie linger days later. But most of them no longer provoke chills. The mark of a good horror film is that its themes stick with you in the light of day after the scary stuff has faded. The Ring passes that test. Its just too bad that days later Im still trying to unravel its sometimes illogical plot. Grade B Todays Deals Bass Pro Shops Clearance Sale Deals from 1 + free shipping w/...

Running time 115 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence profanity moderate gore). At the the E-Walk the Kips Bay the Union Square others. ------- THE Ring"" is a stylish but distressingly generic and not particularly scary American remake of a phenomenally popular Japanese supernatural thriller that spawned two sequels and a TV miniseries. The premise - a video that leads to the death of everyone who watches it seven days later - has already been ripped off by the mercifully forgotten ""feardotcom"" which changed it to a Web site and the time frame to 48 hours all to no avail. This version - directed by DreamWorks house hack Gore Verbinski (""Mouse Hunt"" ""The Mexican"") and written by Ehren Kruger (""Reindeer Games"") without much imagination - is set in Seattle where Rachel (Naomi Watts) is a reporter for the local newspaper. She learns that her niece along with three of her friends died abruptly after watching the mysterious tape which she tracks down at the remote mountain cabin where they were partying. Rachel watches the tape herself - a surreal series of images including an old house a centipede and a stern-looking woman dumping a girl into a well - and then the phone rings with her seven-day warning. With the clock ticking and her son Aidan (Haley Joel Osment clone David Dorfman) seeing dead people that he draws our heroine enlists the help of her ex-boyfriend and Aidans dad Noah (Martin Henderson) who conveniently happens to be a video expert. Rachels investigation takes her to an island where she confronts a mysterious old man (Brian Cox given little to do) who turns out to have a connection with the girl in the well. Just about anyone who regularly watches this type of film is going to figure out where Rachel is going at least half an hour before she gets there - though the films final desperate attempt to wrap up loose ends manages to produce one head-scratcher of an ending. Watts who gave a breakthrough performance in ""Mulholland Drive"" isnt particularly convincing as a reporter and sometimes slips into her Australian accent. ""The Ring"" is moodily photographed by Bojan Bazelli and quite watchable but the mood it provokes is deja vu - rather than genuine dread.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 18 2002 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 126AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Ring Directed by Gore Verbinski Written by Ehren Kruger Starring Naomi Watts David Dorfman and Martin Henderson Classification AA Rating 1/2 A big-budget American remake of a Japanese sensation The Ring is based on the premise of a cursed video that causes anyone who sees it to die within a week. The problem is not the content of the video (a collection of disconnected black and white images that suggests a surreal editing experiment from the late 1920s) but its anonymous author. Through the course of the film it becomes apparent that the video was literally ghost-written -- by a malevolent spirit determined to spread its psychic imprint like a virus on the living population. DreamWorkss The Ring directed by Gore Verbinski feels ghost-written in quite a different way At best its a workmanlike passably engrossing horror flick that copies well from the Japanese original. When its good its not original and when its original its not so good. Director Hideo Nakatas original Ringu (1998) based on a novel by Koji Suzuki had a spooky linearity in its tale of a woman journalist who tries to find the source of a series of teen deaths including that of her niece. There are much more artistically accomplished and dread-filled Japanese horror films (Kiyoshi Kurosawas Cure and Pulse) but Ringu has a pop kick (it spawned two sequels) with its vision of a modern Japan of divorced professional mothers cellphones and videotape haunted by its past represented by a remote volcanic island where malignant spirits lie in wait. In its opening scene The Ring is a 60-million film that does a reasonably good impression of a low-budget teen horror tossoff. This is especially true of the prelude (borrowed directly from the Japanese original) which features plaid-skirted teenaged girls alone in a house talking sex and urban myths. Quickly though it switches gears and initially theres a happy surprise in the casting. The bird-like Australian actress Naomi Watts ( Mulholland Drive) is the perfectly updated Hitchcockian heroine a plucky single mom Rachel Keller with her emotions well in check. The sad-eyed David Dorfman is distressingly credible as her semi-neglected eight-year-old son Aidan whose teacher is worried about his distressingly death-themed drawings. One of the girls in the prelude Katie was Rachels niece and Aidans babysitter and now she has mysteriously died along with several of her classmates. At the girls wake Rachel begins asking questions and traces the tape back to a rustic motel cabin where the teenagers went to a party. Rachel drives up to the motel under the gloomy Pacific Northwest sky rents a room and takes the tape with her. She watches it gets the phone call and starts to worry. In her anxiety she turns to her ex-husband Noah (Martin Henderson) a callow Peter Pan of a man who happens to know about videos. Despite a slapdash investigation (theres a television detective-show habit of improbable luck and coincidence at work) Rachel finds some pieces of a puzzle a video image of a lighthouse that she traces to a local island the location of a horse farm where the horses went mad. There she meets Brian Cox the remaining figure from a family where things went very badly but the scene is puzzling. Cox (the original Hannibal in Michael Manns Manhunter) is large wet-lipped and rheumy-eyed and hell yes hes scary. Theres just no particular logic as to why he needs to be that way in the story. Screenwriter Ehren Kruger fails to provide anything beyond one-dimensional characters without background history a large lapse for a fairly ambitious movie. Given that the entire ghost narrative is related to the effect of a disturbed marriage on a child it would make sense to offer a tidbit or two about Rachels own failed marriage. Without real-life grounding the characters seem little more than functionaries in an elaborate baffling paranoid fantasy. That being said there are at least a couple of genuinely skin-crawling scenes in The Ring. The first (a narrative red herring) is a jolting sequence when a stallion goes mad on a ferry boat. The second lifted directly from the original movie is the culmination of the movies double-climax which is best not described in detail. As in David Cronenbergs Videodrome it involves a television image made flesh. Though The Ring is only a copy it still can carry the echo of a real chill.

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Like most horror movies ""The Ring"" is something of a con game a baited hook we bite at eagerly even though we arent really fooled by it. But the line dropped here by director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger (adapting the Japanese cult film of the same name) wanders almost accidentally into deep dark waters. What begins as a routine teen-horror flick -- an urban legend inflated to mythic status -- eventually becomes a clammy claustrophobic bad dream in which the power of evil cannot be contained by love or death or technology or any other force. I slept fine the night after I saw ""The Ring"" but the next night was a problem At a certain point long after midnight I found myself sitting bolt upright in bed completely possessed by two hair-raising moments late in the film. (For those of you whove seen it one of those will be obvious. The other is that kid saying that line.) Its a slippery murky gray-green film full of borrowings from ""Twin Peaks"" ""The Sixth Sense"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" ""Poltergeist"" and who knows what-all else. But its also very much its own thing a deviously engineered parasite thatll crawl under your skin and live in your nervous system for a while if you give it half a chance. Its a pretty dippy premise Theres this weird videotape see one you cant find at Blockbuster. You watch it you get a creepy phone call and seven days later you die. We open in fact with one teenage girl eagerly recounting this scenario to another who turns ash-white and announces that -- gulp -- shes seen the tape. Seven days earlier. A few minutes later Teen No. 2 is alone with the TV set which switches itself on and cant be switched off. Something very bad comes out of it. She dies. The scene is borderline ridiculous and not all that scary. But importantly it isnt played for laughs the way most horror-movie killings are these days. Its our first clue that Verbinski and Kruger are after something different something like the logic and symbology of the unconscious. This death is nothing more than the first go-round the first iteration in a broadening and deepening pattern that -- as we discover exactly what the human race is up against in ""The Ring"" -- will become very frightening indeed. Verbinski whos shown little more than empty visual panache in such previous movies as ""The Mexican"" and ""Mouse Hunt"" doesnt keep us on the surface of this implausible yarn for long. Rachel (Naomi Watts) a hard-boiled skeptical journalist who is the dead girls aunt begins to investigate teen whispers about the killer tape. She tracks it down easily of course (the similarity in titles is an accident but like the central artifact in ""The Lord of the Rings"" the videotape wants to be found). As soon as she watches it the halfway plausible world in which the film opens -- a dreary rain-soaked Seattle that looks like it might be David Lynchs screen-saver -- starts to melt and drip like one of Salvador Dalis pocket watches. Rachel gets the phone call. (A childs voice ""Seven days."") Nothing seems all that different at first -- except that her face in photographs now looks like an unrecognizable smear. She takes the tape to her estranged husband Noah (hunky if forgettable Martin Henderson) a video geek who reports that it wasnt created with a camera or any other known technology. Meanwhile their son Aidan (David Dorfman) one of those spookily precocious kids who have become ubiquitous in the post-""Sixth Sense"" horror universe is receiving communications from person or persons unknown and drawing some troubling pictures. You Might Also Like This isnt much of an actors movie but the beautiful Watts -- the object of considerable Web fandom for her performance in ""Mulholland Drive"" -- plays Rachel as a finely calibrated instrument gradually going out of tune. Determined to solve the mystery before her seven days are up Rachel along with Noah and Aidan is plunged into a dense and convoluted story that I shouldnt discuss in detail. It involves such archetypal Freudian and/or Jungian elements as a journey to a distant island a lighthouse an imprisoned child an unsolved killing and an epidemic that renders horses suicidal. (One of the most shocking scenes in ""The Ring"" happens outdoors in broad daylight -- or as broad as daylight gets off the Washington coast anyway -- and features a horse on a ferryboat.) What I can talk about is the fact that ""The Ring"" incorporates the language of film surrealism more convincingly than any horror film I can think of since ""Night of the Living Dead"" ""Carnival of Souls"" and ""Psycho."" The killer videotape itself is an almost indescribable non-narrative montage in grainy black-and-white -- a woman in a mirror a man at a window a ladder against a wall a centipede crawling from beneath a table and ""the ring"" a circle of light resembling the corona of a solar eclipse -- that strongly suggests such key surrealist works as Maya Derens ""Meshes in the Afternoon"" or Luis Bunuels collaboration with Dali ""Un chien andalou."" As Noah comments after watching the tape (against Rachels wishes) its ""very film-student."" At the same time anybody whos seen those kinds of art movies is familiar with the sensation They dont make sense and theyre pretty creepy. But where does the creep factor come from? Is it because the images theyve planted in our minds actually do add up to something something that remains just outside our rational grasp? As ""The Ring"" progresses the boundaries between the films ""real"" world and the videotapes world give way The mirror and window appear in a real house (on the distant island of course) and the ladder appears against a wall outside Noahs loft. A fly that appears on the tape can actually be plucked from the TV screen and set free. ""Before you die you see the Ring"" Rachel speculates and indeed this turns out to be true. OK Im not actually suggesting that ""The Ring"" is a serious art movie. But it is a seriously scary movie largely because Verbinski and Kruger (the writer of ""Scream 3 and ""Arlington Road"" among other films) remain true to the laws of their created universe and dont cheat their audience on the subject of evil. Who created the diabolical videotape in ""The Ring"" and what do they want? Well just as in all the truly memorable horror movies from ""The Exorcist"" to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" the dark forces dont want understanding or love or a Christian burial -- they just want to terrify and destroy us.

"Chilling Ring stops just short of horror - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Chilling Ring stops just short of horrorOctober 18 2002|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer Weve all had the experience of seeing a videotape were sorry we watched of wishing we could go back in time and take those unhappy images out of our minds. Its like that for the characters in the supernatural thriller ""The Ring"" only worse. A whole lot worse.""Have you heard about this tape that kills you when you watch it?"" a bored teenage girl (the movies recognize no other kind) asks her friend Katie in the opening scene. ""When its over the phone rings and someone says You will die in seven days. "" The girl giggles and then notices something. Katie isnt giggling.Yes friends Katie has watched this particular tape (which begins with the image of a ring) and has received that very phone call and no good will come of any of it -- for her or for anyone else. Within scant minutes the prophecy is fulfilled and the story of that deadly video kicks into a higher gear.""The Ring"" does the best it can with this splendid premise one of the creepiest spookiest notions in years. It came from Japan where novelist Koji Suzuki wrote the original book and the film that resulted was such a sensation that it inspired a sequel and a prequel.DreamWorks acquired the remake rights and perhaps not surprisingly gave Ehren Krugers efficient script to director Gore Verbinski a solid generalist who previously made ""Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Mexican"" for the studio.Verbinski is a bit of a rarity these days -- someone who as his credits show can be counted on to do a reliable job in a variety of genres. (Which is probably why DreamWorks also used him to spell Simon Wells when the latter faced exhaustion during the making of ""The Time Machine."")Having someone like Verbinski in charge of ""The Ring"" means that while the premise and his competence ensure that the film will be unnerving things could be scarier still if a director who lived only to chill the blood was behind the camera.Its not only Katie as it turns out who saw the tape; three of her young friends watched it with her and they all died at precisely the same time exactly one week later. This unsettling coincidence catches the eye of Katies aunt crack newspaper reporter and single mom Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) whos already been asked by her sister to figure out whats going on.Also affected by Katies death is her cousin Rachels young son Aidan (David Dorfman) a solemn spooky little person who has ""I see dead people"" written all over him.Ever the intrepid reporter Rachel traces the tape to the sinister Shelter Mountain Inn and being a fearless modern person watches the video (which has something of the look of a bad student film) for herself.Naturally things start to happen that convince Rachel this tape is for real. She contacts her video whiz friend Noah (Martin Henderson) and is astonished and chilled to learn that this tape in effect has no fingerprints no clues as to where it was made.Rachel perseveres and her discoveries which end up involving -- among other elements -- dead horses a lighthouse a mental hospital and potent cameos by Brian Cox and Jane Alexander culminate in a clever enough ending.""The Rings"" shrewd premise is fueled not only by the omnipresence of video copies that turn up in our lives from who knows where but also by a particularly modern feeling of powerlessness by a sense that forces out of our control have a profound and unhappy effect on our lives.One of the keys to making ""The Ring"" work as well as it does is the strong performance by Watts who came to prominence with her dual role in David Lynchs ""Mulholland Drive."" Its up to her to lend credibility to this strange scenario and her presence succeeds in making us believe.Helped as well by the foggy atmosphere of its Pacific Northwest setting ""The Ring"" is certainly acceptable. But no one seeing it is going to feel as spooked as executive producer Roy Lee the man who introduced the film to DreamWorks did when he first saw the Japanese version. He was so scared he told a reporter that he simply turned off the movie and more than once.To make an audience feel that intensely you need a different kind of director and a different kind of film.The RingMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic elements disturbing images language and some drug references.

Supernatural Video Games - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Ring Supernatural Video GamesMovies - REVIEW - The RingThe Premise Is Entertaining -- Just Dont Expect Logical Explanations.October 18 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticNo its not a boxing picture or a Tolkien knockoff.The Ring is a supernatural thriller with a cool urban-legend premise. Its such a diabolically clever premise in fact that you dearly wish the rest of the film could live up to it.The plot centers on a videotape with an eerie avant-garde stream of images on it Think Un Chien Andalou but without the bisected eyeball and youll have the basic idea.The gimmick is that immediately after someone watches this tape there is trouble.The phone rings. The persons face comes out blurry in photos. Mysterious markings appear on the persons arm. And worst of all in seven days the person drops dead.What makes this premise so perversely entertaining is that you cant help thinking in some primitive corner of your mind that by watching The Ring youre exposing yourself to danger too. And when the film which opens today in theaters comes out on video that feeling should be even stronger.One idea this powerful is almost all a movie needs. Almost.It also needs a compelling justification for the premise -- an explanation of how the tape works that makes sense on both intellectual and emotional levels.The explanation offered by screenwriter Ehren Kruger (Arlington Road) is too weak. To say that its full of holes would suggest that it attempts to be logical and it doesnt.Still theres that premise . . .There is also a sustained atmosphere of dread courtesy of director Gore Verbinski (The Mexican). The films murkiness and muted colors suggest the malaise of the treacherous limbo into which the characters wander.And there are the performances too especially the sharp sympathetic one by Naomi Watts (the bright-eyed blonde in Mulholland Drive) who plays an intrepid reporter investigating the tape. Watts has a gift for curiosity -- the tilt of her nose suggests that shes always sniffing out answers.Brian Cox Martin Henderson and Jane Alexander also star. David Dorfman plays the reporters young son a kid who intuits things others dont.The Ring is based on Japanese director Hideo Nakatas 1998 movie Ringu which has its roots in a series of novels by Koji Suzuki. The new American version raises some interesting questions including one that is implicitIf the videotape can kill people what would the DVD do?

Not the Web site that kills you - that was Feardotcom - but this killer video with grainy images of a lonely tree an extension ladder and a Shaker chair that will have you gasp your final breath within seven days?You will. Its the electronic murder weapon in The Ring a creepy oozy dopey remake of the stylish 1998 Japanese thriller Ringu. From the stark compositions on the killer video in the new version its maker would seem to be a deranged conceptual artist who bores victims to death.One could almost lob the same criticism at Gore Verbinski director of this remake. However grudgingly it must be said that two or three times he successfully scares the audience - if not to death to a state approaching rigor mortis.Verbinski sets his movie in Seattle where its always raining and where the general mood is Poltergeists-who-possess-The Sixth Sense.Heroine Rachel (Naomi Watts the lovely blonde from Mulholland Drive in another role as a sexy Nancy Drew out to solve an impenetrable mystery) is a single mom (whose son sees dead people) and reporter for the Post-Intelligencer.When Rachels niece dies a week after watching the killer video Rachel wants to do an investigative story. So what does she do? She gets a copy of the video and watches it. Would you consult a doctor who tries to cure a lethal virus by injecting herself with a dose of it? Someone this stupid deserves to die.While Rachel defies logic a subsequent scene in which she leaves the video around for her insomniac 10-year-old son to watch defies belief.Verbinski steers past these formidable gaps in logic because there is no logic to what frightens us. Verbinski frightens us with rain with the wide-eyed faces of kids in jeopardy with a sequence of a horse galloping off a ferry and into the stormy sea. Most sinister of all is the pervasive image of a TV broadcasting snow - who knows what evil lurks in cathode-ray emissions?But whatever Verbinskis gifts as the visual stylist of Mouse Hunt and The Mexican and this The Ring is more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat.This said if youre superstitious and want to see this movie it would be really perverse to wait for the video.Contact Carrie Rickey at crickeyphillynews.com or 215-854-5402.The Ring Produced by Walter F.

"Ring The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ring-the ) Ring The (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli To describe The Ring two adjectives leap to mind spooky and lame. The former refers to the tone and atmosphere which are about as good as it gets for a ghost story. The latter refers to the storyline which is about as poorly constructed as can be imagined a a sad amalgamation of irritating contrivances and gaping plot holes that defy even a generous attempt to suspend disbelief. And while I normally appreciate open-ended motion pictures The Ring takes things too far by leaving about 75% of its questions unanswered. This isnt an artistic choice; its screenwriting sloppiness and it results in a profoundly dissatisfying experience. I knew the moment I exited The Ring that I didnt like the movie but the gloomy atmosphere is so seductive that it took me a while to realize why. The problem lies in the storytelling. The Ring is an incoherent mess and the more you reflect upon it the less credible it becomes. (Note Im using the word ""credible"" within the context of the horror/ghost story genre.) The movie seems to have been slapped together without concern about whether anything makes sense. The twist ending feels like something grafted on and it left me with a question about which was more absurd a the revelation discovered by the main character or the manner in which she makes the discovery. People who are easily unsettled by ghost stories will be freaked out by The Ring. Director Gore Verbinski has studied the masters and understands exactly what it takes to create the perfect ""boo"" moment. The loud noise the sudden movement the musical stinger a theyre all there and Verbinski employs them with enough skill to apply the ""gotcha"" to even the most jaded veteran horror fanatic a time or two. Unfortunately thats about all this movie has going for it a quick cheap thrills. The Ring is a remake of a Japanese movie that I have not seen. Fans of the original swear by it which leads me to believe that it must be a lot better than the American version. The film postulates the existence of a video tape that when watched means death to the viewer. The moment the tape ends anyone having enjoyed the surreal images represented on it receives a phone call informing them that they have one week to live. Exactly seven days later they die and nothing they do can stop the Grim Reaper. When a skeptical Seattle-based investigative reporter Rachel (Naomi Watts) learns about the tape she tracks it down and watches it. Shortly after being marked for death she becomes a believer. So with the help of her ex-boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) who has also seen the tape she begins an investigation to unravel the mystery before her time runs out. Along the way a horrifying thing happens a Rachels young son Aidan (David Dorfman) sees the tape sealing his fate. If you were a mother who believed that watching a tape could result in a death sentence would you leave it in a place where your son could view it? This is only one of numerous obvious problems with The Ring. The movie is so intent upon unsettling us that it loses sight of credibility issues like this one. Rachels investigation is a follow-the-dots exercise in coincidence and contrivance like a gothic version of bad Agatha Christie. The Ring has its share of memorable moments a the opening sequence with the girls watching TV and the horse-gone-wild on the ferry stick in my mind a but the connective tissue is Swiss cheese. And when all is said and done a whole lot of what has transpired doesnt make any sense. Naomi Watts making her follow-up to David Lynchs Mulholland Drive is suitably appealing as Rachel. (Is it just me or does Watts resemble a blond version of her friend Nicole Kidman?) Martin Henderson is fine as her ex-boyfriend and investigative partner. And Brian Cox has a chilling cameo. Unfortunately the other key player child actor David Dorfman is a blank slate. He comes across as a knockoff of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense a and thats a performance I wasnt terribly excited by in the first place. I dont recommend The Ring but its the kind of movie that could play well to small groups watching it on TV with all the lights out. At least theres no overload of gore a Verbinski has elected to go the suspense route. Unfortunately he has such a weak script that his efforts amount to a not-so-triumphant victory of style over substance.
