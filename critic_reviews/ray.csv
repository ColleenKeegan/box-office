So why did I keep looking at my watch? It certainly wasnt the music you can never get tired of hearing Charles sing ""I Got A Woman"" and ""Whatd I Say."" Nor does ""Ray"" fall into hagiography while it pays tribute to Charless refusal to regard his blindness as a handicap his activism and his seminal contribution to music Hackford isnt afraid to show us his flaws the many infidelities (its said the Raelettes got their name because they had to ""let Ray"") the heroin abuse the kiss-offs to old friends for the sake of a more lucrative deal. Genius isnt nice.Charles crossed over from blues to gospel to Ramp;B to country to pop from black to white audiences at a time when segregation reigned. And at the age of 7 he crossed over from the world of sight to the world of the sightless not long after watching his brother drown. Its interesting that the most moving segments of ""Ray"" are these flashbacks to his childhood when blindness descends and he learns under the guidance of his remarkable mother (Sharon Warren) to navigate the world by sounds alone. C. J. Sanders plays Ray as a child and these are the only scenes in which we see his eyes.Jamie Foxxs adult Ray is hidden behind those dark glasses. Foxx is amazing the rocking body the gravel voice the ecstatic musicality the pride and self-destructiveness are perfect not to mention the joyous carnality that coexists with Charless shrewd businessmans mind. But were always at arms length from the man. Is it because we never see his eyes? Foxx is denied one of the most crucial tools an actor has which makes his performance all the more remarkable but may explain the paradoxical chill at the heart of a movie about one of our most exuberant musicians. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Foxx gets royal backup from the women in the cast Kerry Washington as his churchgoing wife Della Bea; Warren as his mother and best of all Regina King as the Raelette Margie Hendricks his mistress and musical inspiration. Margies smoking rendition of ""Hit the Road Jack"" after she and Ray have brawled is a highlight. ""Ray"" is filled with such pleasures but its hobbled by the too-familiar conventions of the musical biopic with so many chapters of Charless life to cover Hackfords movie never finds a rhythm a groove to settle into.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Assuming the persona of Ray Charles as if it were always his he becomes the singer in such an evocative way youre not sure which ones the real Ray anymore. When the movie concludes with footage of the actual Ray Charles toward the end of his life (he died in June at age 73) there is almost no jarring feeling -- no reminder youve been watching an actor before that. Some have lamented in higher critical circles that ""Ray"" is so-so and that Foxx is the best thing about it. This is only partly true. The movie directed by Taylor Hackford is certainly drawn directly from the Official Biopic Hollywood Playbook in which the subject is caught as if by chance experiencing the most significant events of his or her life. Jamie Foxx embodies the legendary performer Ray Charles in the richly textured biopic ""Ray"" directed by Taylor Hackford. (Universal Studios) _____More in Movies_____  Ray Details  Watch the Trailer  Video Desson Thomson Reviews Ray  Profile Director Taylor Hackford  Profile Jamie Foxx  More on the Real Ray Charles  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now These movies unfold like an overextended highlights reel and some part of you feels cheated about it. You dont feel as though youre getting the texture of that persons life just the official stats and high points. Watching the scenes of Charless heroin shooting for instance I remembered the deeper texture of what its like to be addicted in Clint Eastwoods ""Bird"" thanks to Forest Whitakers affecting turn as Charlie Parker. Eastwood left things to the actor to show that not by effects or editing. ""Ray"" does have this biopic element. And certainly it honors that cheesy requirement that all movies end with a cue to stand up and cheer. You can almost hear a voice-over on the coming attractions reel ""The story of one mans courage against the odds."" But Hackfords film scripted by James L. White also has the needed texture. In one of the movies most telling scenes the young Ray (played at this point by C.J. Sanders) has just become blind. He takes a fall. Calls for his mother. Shes in the room and opens her mouth to speak but checks herself. The boy keeps hollering. Slowly he gets up. He gropes his way around. Now he starts using his ears to locate things a passing horse and cart outside a boiling pot of water. He locates a cricket catches it in his hands. And his mother stays silent. Shes teaching him independence. But we get ahead of ourselves. This is about a little boy born in rural poverty in Albany Ga. in 1930 raised by a proud mother. The most traumatic incident of his life occurs seven years later. His younger brother George is drowned and the young Ray blames himself. The shock in conjunction with glaucoma affects his eyesight the following year. He becomes blind. And his mother gives him that lesson. Rays blindness begets many gifts. He develops a heightened ability for mimicry of people and the music that he grew up with. A vibrant pianist and vocalist he absorbs rhythm and blues gospel jazz and even country directly into his soul and he plays it back with virtuoso ease. He also gains a fierce sense of independence and business savvy which will serve him well when people in the music industry try to take advantage of him. But there are other permutations to his lack of sight. Hes painfully lonely. His need for women and the comfort of heroin become a debilitating double monkey on his back. His mother warned him at an early age not to live like a cripple. He rejects walking canes or guide dogs. But the drugs and the women meant to be solace for the darkness around him become handicaps of their own. After the tragedies of his childhood the young Ray learns to read Braille and develops his musical abilities. At 17 he takes a bus to Seattle where he joins the local jazz scene. His career picks up when he signs with Ahmet Ertegun (Curtis Armstrong) and Jerry Wexler (Richard Schiff) founders of Atlantic Records. There is so much that he goes through including a romance with Della Bea Robinson (Kerry Washington) whom he marries; his passionate on-the-road relationship with Margie Hendricks (Regina King); and his friendship with band member and saxophonist David ""Fathead"" Newman (Bokeem Woodbine). The story also gets into Rays lifelong battle with addiction his checkered life as a married man and father and a confrontation with the Jim Crow South His refusal to perform in a segregated hall in Georgia leads to a ban for life from the state. (Its later rescinded in the 1970s when the state issues a formal apology and makes his ""Georgia on My Mind"" the official state song.) And of course there are the songs with such hits as ""Ive Got a Woman"" ""Whatd I Say"" ""Hit the Road Jack"" ""Georgia on My Mind"" and ""America the Beautiful."" Thanks to the inspired work of Hackford and White production designer Stephen Altman cinematographer Pawel Edelman and editor Paul Hirsch a more than two-hour film slides by gracefully rather than trundles. But the emotional power rightfully comes from the actors. Washington and King are spirited as Rays good and bad women; Woodbine is a charm as Fathead. Theyre just the backup though. Foxx does what hes supposed to. He steals his own show. His body movements are not exaggerated but subtle; and his verbal performance is remarkable perfectly capturing Rays inflections and directness yet making them his own. Being Jamie Foxx the funny man from ""In Living Color"" hes never far away from a humorous aside whether its a slight furrowing of the brow a quick rejoinder or a deftly comic ""hello"" when things are getting a little out of hand around him which they often are. No matter what comes down and theres a whole lot of that this Ray carries his own charismatic flashlight because no one else is going to do it for him. And as he lights his way he illuminates the whole theater. RAY (PG-13 135 minutes) -- Contains extensive drug use and sexual situations. Area theaters.

But the best reason is the absolutely astounding performance of Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles a scion of southern apartheid a man who being blind and black spent a lifetime trying to get his. To hear Charles sing ""America the Beautiful"" was to hear not so much a paean to Americas greatness as the blues of a man who grabbed and got -- but even in the winning never forgot why he had to fight in the first place. Forget about Foxxs past comedy career as Weird Wanda (""I wanna rock your world"") on the TV sketch show ""In Living Color."" To describe Foxxs performance here is to gush and so gush we will He is amazing inhabiting Charless skin with the ease of a doppelganger performing with eyes glued shut his bass speaking voice ratcheted up to a breathy falsetto his broad shoulders narrowed. He captures it all the bobbing head movements the sly wit the turn-on-a-dime temper of a truly complicated man. He doesnt act so much as he channels. It is the kind of performance that creates careers. As musical giant Ray Charles Jamie Foxx gets to the troubled soul of the man despite a Taylor Hackford biopic thats too cinematic.

He was born at the bottom rung of poor to a washerwoman mother and a father who was mostly missing in action. As a very young boy he saw his baby brother drown in his mothers washtub. Shortly afterward at the age of 7 he went blind. Being ""colored"" and disabled meant there was no end to the insults. He was called a ""blind nigra"" (and worse) and ""blind Bama"" (a reference to his rural roots). Some people assumed that blind meant stupid a perception that his proudly independent mother (played by Sharon Warren) urged him to fight. And he did learning to live as independently as possible but also learning to use his blindness to manipulate. In the opening scene he tells a racist bus driver that he lost his sight in the Battle of Normandy. (""You were in Normandy?"" the bus driver asks suddenly scrambling to assist the man hed scorned just a minute before.) He did what he had to do in order to do what he most wanted make music. And what music encompassing everything from raunchy blues to mournful country-western to jazz. ""Ray"" brilliantly captures the excitement of the man onstage. In the hands of director Taylor Hackford (""An Officer and a Gentleman"") the music scenes which employ Charless recordings are an intoxicating whirl familiar terrain perhaps for older viewers but a revelation for younger ones who associate him with ""youve got the right one bay-beee"" Pepsi commercials. Bit by bit the evolution of a man is shown through his music from his marrying of gospel with popular soul music to his crossover success of ""Whatd I Say"" an improvised tune that topped both the Ramp;B and pop charts. But ""Ray"" being a movie ultimately resorts to movie techniques. It gives you standard biopic fare -- tough childhood humble beginnings and then a breathless ascent to the top -- until it whips around to the ending a sappy-sweet hugely unbelievable moment of Hallmark hoo-ha. Rays birth mother Aretha (in fact he was raised by two women) needs only a halo to complete her portrait of the saintly single mom -- shes even filmed in soft focus. Southern whites are painted with too broad a brush and similarly Charless chicks on the side are all one-dimensional money-grubbing hos (though Regina King as Raelette Margie Hendricks gives her underwritten role considerable heft and fierceness). The death of Charless brother is used as an easy reference point for all his troubles the event that supposedly led him to a life under the spell of the needle. (Charles would have disagreed with that categorization. He once confessed to Ed Bradley on ""60 Minutes"" that he used drugs for another reason He liked them.) And then theres the womanizing. Oh the womanizing. Blindness didnt hamper his notorious tomcatting. Charles used an unorthodox technique to ascertain a womans attractiveness Hed shake her hand and then make his way up her arm squeezing and caressing searching out excess bumps and bulges. Its funny on the first take amusing the second played out by the third fourth and fifth times. We dont hear about the divorces. (He had two.) Instead his first wife Della Bea played with a wary vulnerability by Kerry Washington is shown to be a stand-by-your-man type who served as the inspiration for him to get straight. In reality they divorced in the 70s and gin and pot became his substitutes for heroin. And we dont hear much of the children born out of wedlock The movie acknowledges one but he had many more roughly a dozen children in all. Despite the cinematic clunkers ""Ray"" succeeds carried by Charless marvelous music and the force of Foxxs talent. In many ways Ray Charles Robinson was not a nice man He cheated on his wives bamboozled his mistresses and drop-kicked friends and colleagues whom he no longer found expedient. But he had the right stuff reshaping American music and endearing himself with his aw-shucks demeanor. It is to the films credit -- and Foxxs -- that we are able to see behind the flash and fury a man who didnt know how to love and was so much the lonelier for it. Ray (152 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for depiction of drug addiction sexuality and some thematic elements.

Nicola Goode/Universal Studios DatebookDatebookChronicle10/29/2004ALLAdvance0422435095 Photo Credit Nicola Goode Jamie Foxx plays it just right. In this biopic his Ray Charles is an enigmatic musical genius. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Ray Biographical drama. Starring Jamie Foxx Kerry Washington and Regina King. Directed by Taylor Hackford. (PG-13. 153 minutes. At Bay Area theaters It takes all of five seconds tops to believe that Jamie Foxx is the young Ray Charles . In ""Ray"" a warts-and-all musical biography of the late entertainer Foxx gives a complicated portrait of a man who grew up poor and blind and found his way to the pinnacle of stardom and esteem. According to ""Ray"" he didnt do it by smiling and being a nice guy. He did it by smiling and being cold-blooded as well as prodigiously talented. Foxxs complex performance and the filmmakers willingness to look at the dark side place ""Ray"" safely out of the realm of typical Hollywood hagiography. The movie is too long by a good 30 minutes and it becomes for a time a monotonous slog of club gigs and joyless womanizing. But by the end its hard to imagine audiences really minding. This uncompromising movies strengths are too undeniable and too rare to go unappreciated. Foxx not only captures the essence of Charles exterior but suggests his psychological structure as well. Acting is usually all about looking the other actor in the eye and responding honestly but as Ray Foxx has the handicap of having to act with eyes closed. He uses this to his advantage suggesting that Rays blindness contributed to an eerie distance in his personal dealings. At key moments without looking perturbed or concerned -- as if almost muttering to himself -- Ray is shown cutting loved ones out of his life. He doesnt see the pained faces. Its just one less voice in the room. Rays saving grace is his courage. When we meet him hes 17 and getting on a bus to go from his hometown in Florida to Seattle where he knows no one. If Ray is insular its because life has forced him into an inner attentiveness that doesnt let him drop his guard. On his first date with his future wife he walks her home then assures her he can make his way back because he has memorized how many blocks left and right he has to go to get to his hotel. Even as hes focused on the girlfriend hes aware of every step. Throughout the movie flashes back to Rays childhood a saga of Depression-era poverty and tragedy. When Rays mother -- fiercely played by newcomer Sharon Warren -- realizes her son is going blind she insists that the boy learn to be self-reliant. Warrens performance bursts with the pain anger and hope of a mother who knows she cant protect her son against life and is determined to give him a fighting chance. As played by Warren Rays mother is an extraordinary woman who sets the pattern for the other women in Rays life all of them intense and passionate -- especially Della Bea (Kerry Washington) who becomes Rays wife and Margie Hendricks a backup singer who serves as a kind of de facto wife for Ray when hes on the road. Though the elements are there -- success drug abuse redemption -- ""Ray"" doesnt conform to a neat VH1 ""Behind the Music"" structure. Rays dependency on heroin settles in over a period of years concurrent with his gradual rise to fame. His womanizing is instinctive and remorseless. Theres really no neat pattern to Rays life and the movie is right not to impose one. Yet after a while theres a sameness Same drugs same women same problems. When two hours and 20 minutes into the film its still only 1965 ""Ray"" begins to feel like a story told in real time. Yet even during its weakest stretch (about two-thirds in) theres always the music. ""Ray"" is not just for fans of Ray Charles but for everyone. Director Taylor Hackford turns the creation of Charles signature song ""Whatd I Say"" during a nightclub jam session into an exhilarating sequence. Likewise were made to feel the excitement of Charles early musical experiments his fusion of gospel and blues in songs such as ""I Got a Woman"" and ""Mary Ann."" Even people previously indifferent to Charles will come away with an increased appreciation and understanding of his work. They still might not understand him but that wont be the movies fault. Ray Charles was an enigma. He kept his distance kept his dignity and saved a little something of himself for his music. -- Advisory This film contains adult situations and scenes of drug use.

RELATED  Ray Charles dead at 73 YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Taylor Hackford Jamie Foxx Ray Charles or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? LOS ANGELES California (CNN) -- Director Taylor Hackford and star Jamie Foxx hit all the right notes -- from the brightest trebles to the most brooding basses -- in ""Ray"" a remarkable movie showcasing the symphony of Ray Charles life.Foxx doesnt just imitate Charles he becomes him. His every gesture movement of his head and spring in his step reflect the musical rhythms and contradictory emotions raging within the deeply complicated singer. Foxx is so perfect that you forget youre watching an actor play Charles -- whos not just a role but was a living breathing American icon.If theres any justice the performance will earn Foxx an Academy Award nomination.Charles rich life was a natural for the big screen -- but it also left the filmmakers the classic problem with film biographies which is what to include what to leave out and how to frame the story. Though the ending feels rushed (the audience is filled in -- via montages -- about the time period between the late 70s and the singers death earlier this year) overall Hackford (""An Officer and a Gentleman"" ""Hail Hail Rock n Roll"") and screenwriter James L. White have done an excellent job of condensing Charles complex life.The story vividly covers the time period from 1948 when Charles was 17 and just getting started as a professional performer through 1979 and features frequent flashbacks to Charles troubled childhood.Fueled by tragedyIndeed it was during these early years when the singer witnessed the accidental drowning of his younger brother George and lost his sight due to glaucoma.These flashbacks are especially effective. His mother played by Sharon Warren -- making her film debut -- gives a terrifically strong performance. And child actor C.J. Sanders does an amazing job playing Charles as a young child. The scenes in which he portrays the boys encroaching blindness in particular are heartbreaking. Supporting performances -- including Richard Schiff as Jerry Wexler and Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun -- are uniformly excellent.The double tragedy of losing his brother and going blind fueled Charles musical ambitions -- and also helped trigger a 20-year addiction to heroin. The film doesnt shy away from scenes of drug abuse; its brutally honest in its depiction of his fall into and his struggle out of addiction. He finally kicked the habit and lived the last 40 years of his life drug free.All this is expertly acted by Foxx. Charles -- who had a hand in shaping the film -- signed off on the casting of the ""Ali"" and ""Collateral"" actor after hearing him play the piano. (Foxx actually has a background playing the instrument and went to college on a music scholarship.)Excellent performancesThe music sung by Charles himself and amazingly conveyed by the actor is utterly sublime and its deeply embedded in the heart of this film. Hackford uses the music -- ""Ive Got a Woman"" ""Georgia On My Mind ""Hit The Road Jack"" ""I Cant Stop Loving You"" and many more -- to enrich and drive the story.Foxxs performance is only the beginning. The entire supporting cast -- also navigating the minefield of portraying real people -- also has perfect pitch Kerry Washington as Charles long-suffering wife Della Bea Robinson; Regina King as the talented but doomed mistress Margie Hendricks; Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun the head of Atlantic Records; Richard Schiff as the legendary producer Jerry Wexler; and Larenz Tate as a young Quincy Jones. Theyre just a few of the performers who make this film leap off the screen.With ""Ray"" Hackford has made a film that -- like Charles music itself -- breaks your heart makes it brim with joy and ultimately fills it with a deep belief in beauty and salvation.""Ray"" opens nationwide on Friday October 29 and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Is it live or is it... Jamie Foxx is uncanny in his performance as Ray Charles. Universal Studios Though Foxx is hardly a one-man band his portrayal of Ray Charles is such a landmark in making the difficult look natural that you wont talk about anything else when you exit the theater. As the anchor of a sometimes harrowing but more often rousing 21/2 hours Foxx (who already had a standout performance this year in Michael Manns Collateral) is the closest to a screen revelation 2004 has produced. He has Charles bobbing head movements his torsos world travels on the piano bench the distinctive way Charles dropped his hands on the keys -- and of course perfecto sunglasses. But this isnt a cartoon performance. It just is. Though Charles never considered himself a rocker director Taylor Hackford (The Idolmaker and the Chuck Berry documentary Hail Hail Rock and Roll) was this projects first step in the right direction. About the movie Ray    1/2 (out of four) Stars Jamie Foxx Kerry Washington Regina King Clifton Powell Aunjanue Ellis Directors Taylor Hackford Distributor Universal Rated PG-13 for depictions of drug addiction sexuality and some thematic elements Opens Friday nationwide Hackford and screenwriter James L. White give us a sturdy impression of their subject nothing more. But even a long biopic can encompass only a few themes. In this case its Charles guilt over a brothers childhood drowning; blindness at age 7; one of two marriages; one of his children (out of 12); the record business; and satisfying renditions of tunes that spur instant recognition and euphoria. Not a bad tally. Though someone probably could concoct a miniseries called Rays Women the primary suffering women in this movie are Kerry Washington as roost-ruling wife Della Aunjanue Ellis as eventually spurned backup singer Mary Ann Fisher and the increasingly versatile Regina King as the tragic Raelette Margie Hendricks who attacks her characters intense ups and downs with equal gusto. Hackfords direction is strong if conventional yet the movie deftly plays with time using flashbacks and showing how memories have affected the present. With Foxx in nearly every adult scene the weight is on him. We dont know yet if hell win the best-actor Oscar but its hard to imagine him not nabbing anyones MVP award. To any poor soul who thinks Foxx wasnt indispensable to this movie Hit the road Jack.

The gist of my message went something like ""Ray Charles? I know he was getting on in years but . . . why? He was only 73. Damn it if I dont hate real life sometimes."" My friend responded by saying that he had never cared much for Ray Charles music. Whatd he say? Never cared much for his music? Not wanting to start a pointless argument about musical taste I e-mailed back ""Just listen to Chitlins With Candied Yams."" This time he didnt respond and I doubt he ever checked out the tune. Which is his loss. But then as I found myself talking with others about Charles I realized that a big part of why so many young music aficionados hadnt responded to Charles had a lot to do with the era in which we grew up. We watched him sing ""America the Beautiful"" lovingly to Ronald and Nancy Reagan. The Diet Pepsi ads (""Youve got the right one bay-bay"") didnt help much either. This ""beloved"" figure was trotted out so often (and often so incongruously) that many people just glazed over with the ""Say uncle"" attitude of ""Okay we get it Hes a legend."" Now we get a glimpse (a word that should be underscored five times) of the man behind the icon in Taylor Hackfords venture Ray a biopic that skims through the musicians life with varying degrees of success. A long-standing project for Hackford -- Charles himself served as technical adviser -- Ray undoubtedly means a lot to him. Clearly the director loves his subject and as evidenced in his other smooth by-the-numbers music films (The Idolmaker the Chuck Berry documentary Hail Hail Rock n Roll and the Hackford-produced La Bamba) he loves music. But for too many minutes of its two and a half hours Ray flips through its cinematic pages with a breathless and-then-this-happened urgency offering up little in the way of personality (or truth) beyond Jamie Foxxs strong performance in the title role and the brilliant music that spikes the celluloid.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm The narrative progresses for the most part chronologically beginning in 1948 when 17-year-old piano player Ray Charles Robinson (he dropped the Robinson after ""Sugar"" Ray took the welterweight title) stepped off the Florida Chitlin Circuit and journeyed to Seattle where he helped start a Nat ""King"" Cole sound-alike trio (and met a lifelong friend Quincy Jones). Hackford and screenwriter James L. White follow the path of his increasing popularity his life on the road and his longtime heroin addiction; his troubled marriage to Della Bea (Kerry Washington); his many affairs chiefly with backup singer Mary Ann Fisher (Aunjanue Ellis) and her replacement gravel-voiced shouter Marjorie Hendricks (the fantastic Regina King); and in the films liveliest sequences his performance and recording of the new ""soul"" music. When the movie depicts Charles inventing a controversial blend of gospel and blues developing a new vocal style and signing on to Atlantic Records with mentors Ahmet Ertegun (Curtis Armstrong) and Jerry Wexler (Richard Schiff) Ray is a kick to watch. The scenes of this blind country boy who early on had to insist on being paid in singles so as not to be cheated by club owners and bandleaders becoming a shrewd protector of his own business interests are also compelling. When Charles manages to negotiate the sweet deal at ABC-Paramount whereby he was the first recording artist to own his own masters he doesnt hesitate to leave his friends and co-creators at Atlantic behind. Its cold-blooded but understandable after so many years of dealing with the sort of people who wouldnt hesitate to shortchange a blind man. Or maybe Charles determination to micromanage his destiny went deeper than that. Of his upbringing in rural Georgia Charles once said ""Even compared to other blacks . . . we were on the bottom of the ladder looking up at everyone else. Nothing below us except the ground."" Amid dire poverty -- rendered dreamlike here in supersaturated colors -- Charles strong-minded mother Aretha (Sharon Warren) pushed hard and then harder still for her son who lost his sight to glaucoma at 7 years old to become a person of incredible self-reliance. (Charles never used a cane or a guide dog.) In one disarming scene she watches in tears as the recently blinded Ray struggling to orient himself to his surroundings falls to the floor of their one-room shanty. At the same time she never lifts a finger to help him. Other forays into the past dont work as well as this one. Hackford uses the death by drowning of Charles younger brother to explain the musicians susceptibility to narcotics. Fair enough (though Charles usually discussed his past heroin use as something he started because well it felt good) but to illustrate Charles emotions around this incident as a series of horror-movie hallucinations? The impression is less of an artist haunted by survivors guilt than of a certifiable schizophrenic. Jamie Foxx meanwhile with his perfected impersonation of Charles -- right down to the staggered speaking manner and the body that rocks even when the band isnt playing -- provides the film with most of its joy and depth. He captures both the torment and the sex appeal of a guy who loved countless women and a good laugh a man who refrained from discussing his problems as a matter of principle and instead bled through his music. Lip-synching to Charles recordings the actor-chameleon masterfully re-creates Charles performances including one that marked a zenith not only in Charles career but in the annals of popular music. In a moment that seems like a movie fantasy but isnt The Genius (as he was justly promoted by Atlantic) having run out of material at a gig begins messing with a bass riff on his electric piano while instructing the band and his backup singers the Raylettes to follow along. The result? ""Whatd I Say"" the song that turned the call and response of ""Unnnh Unnnh Oh Oh"" into a monster crossover hit.   At this moment I swooned and fell in love with Ray. But only at this moment. Unfortunately nothing else in the picture matches its impact. More inventive directors than Hackford -- Tim Burton say with Ed Wood or Martin Scorsese with Raging Bull -- understand that a biopic shouldnt feel like a biopic and that the best of them carry a passion and vision that resonate beyond their nominal subject. Ray is indeed inspirational (how can such a life not be?) but it only occasionally moves beyond uplift and easy sentimentality. Then again as Charles once told a reporter ""Im the kind of guy I conform when it suits me and when it doesnt suit me I dont."" So provocative and magnetic was Charles so private yet revealing so smooth yet rough-edged so ready to laugh during an interview or cry onstage in classics like ""Drown in My Own Tears"" that even in more gifted hands Ray the movie could never have measured up to the man himself.

The fables of Buddy Holly Ritchie Valens Johnny Ace Eddie Cochran and Sam Cooke provided their own curtain lines a plane or a car crash a gunshot wound. Their early deaths at the top of their game built little legends -- tragic portraits suitable for filming. But Ray Charles lived his three score and 10. Which is to say pop music being a fickle muse that he outlived the history and heat he made 40 to 50 years ago. In a way the climax to Charles story came this June when he died at 73.

Those obits were the best trailer for a superb biopic one that refreshes Charles luster and fully confirms Jamie Foxx as a scary-good serious actor. Written by James L. White and director Taylor Hackford Ray traces Charles career briskly (given the 2-hr. 32-min. running time) and with a persuasive authenticity. Ray hones his chops on the chitlin circuit signs with Atlantic Records and starts fusing gospel with blues. The epochal Whatd I Say -- a group orgasm in 12-bar form -- could have wed him to rock n roll. But Charles was as voracious for all kinds of music as he was for women. That is very. This plot chugs on parallel tracks with flashbacks set in Charles childhood. The career scenes are shot in high-contrast graininess the early ones in a pellucid sunlight that Charles would soon lose sight of. Those vignettes -- his brother drowning as Charles stands paralyzed his mother sobbing heedlessly on the boys coffin -- have an indelible poignancy. On one radiant afternoon Charles now nearly blinded by glaucoma listens to and memorizes the music of a cricket a clopping horse and breathing softly nearby his mother. ""I hear you too Mama"" the child says. He couldnt stay a child. A blind man on his own had to be an instant grownup -- insisting he get paid in singles say to avoid being cheated. Charles wouldnt baby himself (except for his heroin habit) or let others kid him. What he says sounds arrogant but its a fact ""I walk out alone in the dark and do something no ones done in music and business."" Yes indeed. For Charles business meant leaving his nurturing mentors at Atlantic for a cushy deal at another label. It meant firing a friend and keeping his women (and his drugs) away from his wife. Mainly it meant diversifying his product from Ramp;B to rock n roll and then to country Big Band America the Beautiful -- whatever beguiled his ear. Ray Charles Inc. was a multimusical conglomerate. Ray indulges in music-bio cliches (""Ahmet we gotta get that on wax"") and familiar if potent cold-turkey histrionics. But it paints vividly on a broad canvas with attention to local color and the telling detail. The cast is terrific from top to bottom -- Kerry Washington as Charles wife; Regina King and Aunjanue Ellis as his singer-concubines; Sharron Warren as his tough-love mama; Clifton Powell as his friend and roadie; Bokeem Woodbine as sexy sax man David (Fathead) Newman. If there were an Oscar for ensemble acting Ray would win in a stroll. And Foxx would lead the parade. His nailing of Charles mannerisms (the stutter at the start of a sentence the reflex smile the hugging gesture that thanks a crowd for its cheers) might echo Foxxs In Living Color days. But this is more than a stunt. He carves a complex character out of what could have been hagiography. Foxxs performance like the film is sympathetic but not sentimental. It is as true as the blues to Charles pain as ecstatic as rock n roll to his triumph. It sings and it swings.

Possesses widespread crossover B.O. appeal across the aud spectrum. An uncannily fine performance by Jamie Foxx provides solid footing for ""Ray"" a rangy straightforward and entirely engrossing biopic of the late Ray Charles. Bursting at the seams with music Taylor Hackfords ambitious film provides a good sense of the pioneering entertainers extraordinary journey and brings it to life with plenty of colorful detail. Fittingly for the story of one of the first black crossover pop musicians ""Ray"" possesses widespread crossover B.O. appeal of its own across the audience spectrum which boosted by critical accolades indicates a very potent commercial future for this estimable Universal release. With the singers support Hackford tried for 15 years to find backing for this project which clearly wouldnt have been worth doing unless the right actor existed for the central part. With his performance here Foxxs quick ascent to the top of the Hollywood talent list is complete as he socks over and completely convinces in the difficult part of a blind driven and tragedy-scarred musical genius. Roles made even more challenging by public familiarity with the real man who died only three months ago at age 73. But even the singer-pianist-composers millions of fans will be surprised by much of what they learn here which isnt the entire story to be sure but still provides a potent sampling of Charles demons faults and addictions to go along with the charm talent and strength of character. Although Hackford and first-time screenwriter James L. White parcel out key elements of youthful backstory in brief snippets through much of the tale narrative encompasses the key points in a mostly orderly fashion how Ray Charles Robinson was born into abject poverty in Georgia in 1930; how he watched his brother die in a freak drowning accident then was tortured with guilt over it for years; how he lost his sight within two years of the accident when he was 7 and was sent away to a school for the blind by his hard-working mother who then died leaving him an orphan. Main action picks up in 1948 when Ray was 17 and made a trip alone across country to join the burgeoning Seattle jazz scene. The first person he meets off the bus is local teen Quincy Jones (Larenz Tate) and Rays music quickly catches on at a local dive where hes taken advantage of sexually and financially by his first manager. While Ray got around extremely well -- he never used a cane or dog and always said his blindness made his sense of hearing much more acute -- one area where he had to depend upon others was in contracts and money. Pic reveals how early experience at being cheated (he always insisted upon being paid in one dollar bills so he could count them) eventually made him into one of the toughest businessmen in his field. After cutting his first record and dropping his real last name due to the fame of boxer Sugar Ray Robinson Ray discovered heroin while touring with Lowell Fulson. It was an addiction that lasted until the mid-60s and that he only kicked when his wife made him realize hed probably lose his career if he didnt. His other addiction was women. From his earliest gigs the ladies lined up to get close to this swaying oddly sensual blind man whose amusing way of checking women out -- he felt their wrists then on up their arms -- is nicely observed. Marriage to young gospel singer Della Bea (Kerry Washington) doesnt for a moment stop him from fooling around on the road but through endless affairs especially with blues singer Mary Ann Fisher (Aunjanue Ellis) and volatile backup singer Margie Hendricks (Regina King) Della Bea stuck with him and raised their kids. (Pic doesnt come near accounting however for the 12 children he sired overall.) While Ray can imitate any type of music its Della Bea who challenges him to find his own style which he does by the early 50s by combining Ramp;B and gospel influences into something that was too sexy for traditionalists but put him on the road to No. 1 hits first in Ramp;B and ultimately with ""Georgia on My Mind"" in 1960 on the pop charts. The film finds a good balance between the personal and the professional as well as between the winning and the difficult aspects of the subjects character. With women and business Ray always puts his own interests first; as supportive and personally friendly as Ahmet Ertegun (Curtis Armstrong) and Jerry Wexler (Richard Schiff) are shown to be at Atlantic the label on which he became famous in the 50s he nevertheless abandons them in 1959 when ABC Paramount meets his demand to own his masters. And he drops Jeff Brown (Clifton Brown) the manager who came up with him on the Chitlin Circuit when he thinks hes being cheated and summarily replaces him with the sophisticated and efficient Joe Adams (Harry Lennix). Through the 40s and 50s Ray is depicted as being no more willing to acknowledge racism as a barrier to success than he does his blindness. But in 1961 he abruptly decides he will no longer play for segregated audiences in the South which prompts his native state to ban him from performing. Except for a coda set in 1979 in which Ray receives an apology from Georgia pic avoids third-act problems by ending the chronology in 1966 when he responds to a drug arrest and threatened prison term by going clean. As if the eventful story and charged performances were not enough music constantly amplifies the events as Hackford and music supervisor Curt Sobel have shrewdly used Ray Charles recordings both original and newly prepared to rep both his far-ranging musical tastes -- his proclivity for country is amply stressed -- and his feelings. Soundtrack is terrific and Foxx does an amazing job mimicking the mans unique mannerisms at the piano and microphone. For all of its qualities the film has an even-keeled feel from beginning to end; its prosaic style makes everything go down easily but doesnt endow the picture with intense drama the exhilarating highs or gut-wrenching lows that the story itself offers. All the same its one of Hackfords best pieces of work. With Foxx leading the way performances are strong across the board with Washington Ellis and King each memorable in their own ways; Powell and Bokeem Woodbine the latter as Rays longtime sax player Fathead Newman lending sustained support throughout and Sharon Warren summoning up scary intensity as Rays worked-to-the-bone mother. C.J. Sanders does an exceptional job with what had to be the difficult challenge of expressing young Rays traumas over watching his brother die going blind and being sent away by his mother. Shot largely in Louisiana and decked out handsomely but without ostentation pic unfussily evokes many locales from the red clay of North Florida to the luxury of Rays ultimate Los Angeles manse and all the stops in between.
