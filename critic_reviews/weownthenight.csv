Anne Joyce/2929 Productions LLC hide caption toggle caption Anne Joyce/2929 Productions LLC Director James GrayGenre Crime/DramaRunning Time 117 minutes Brooklyn brothers Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix) and Joseph (Mark Wahlberg) Grusinsky are reasonably comfortable being on opposite sides of the law. Bobby runs a nightclub where drug deals go down about as frequently as mojitos; Joseph followed their dad (Robert Duvall) into law enforcement. Their paths dont cross much until Joseph is made head of the drug enforcement division and starts going after a couple of the Russian mobsters who frequent Bobbys bar. A conventional but smartly acted policier from James (The Yards) Gray the film chronicles a black sheeps return to the fold. Its not surprising but its engaging enough that most patrons will likely cut the director some slack for the out-of-period details and convoluted plot contrivances that make the film seem at once sloppy and too neat.

Trapped again and again in Gods-eye cut-backs long shots and stretched takes coked-up nightclub manager Joaquin Phoenix finds himself forced to reunite with his cop family (Mark Wahlberg as his brother Robert Duvall as his deputy-chief dad) in the late-80s NYC drugs war. But Gray shapes his classical framework too close to both contrivance and convention too often leaving his intriguing thematic payload lost in murky indistinct drama. Eva Mendes completes a volley of evolving insular performances that mesh perfectly with the fading shadows and ambient noise of Grays sombre neo-noir stylings. Yet still for all the heat the slow-burn simply never ignites. Shame because Gray was achingly close to something here. A desperate violence and urgency spills out in the films flash-point set-pieces - not least a sensational car chase shot through a windscreen hammering rain and a blur of fear.

"Review We Own the Night owns the screen - CNN.com Review We Own the Night owns the screenStory Highlights ""We Own the Night"" has basic cop/brother movie elements but with twist Film stars Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg both fine Reviewer Tom Charity Deceptively routine film ""a classic"" Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Irony is on the outs. This fall its fashionable to show your true colors and moviemakers are straining to impress with the kind of moral seriousness we havent seen in American cinema since the 1970s. Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix play brothers at odds in ""We Own the Night."" OK so Im not thinking of ""The Heartbreak Kid"" here -- though that too is a 70s remake -- but it is striking how James Grays cop drama ""We Own the Night"" echoes last weeks earnest ""Michael Clayton"" in style and substance and transcends it in impact. Both films hark back to a more somber measured pace and muted palette a time when movies werent so desperate to rush us off our feet and sought to engage the mind -- not overload the senses. In ""Clayton"" George Clooney plays a lawyer who needs to regain his ethical bearings. In ""We Own the Night"" Joaquin Phoenix is the prodigal son -- a nightclub manager in New York City in the late 80s -- who returns home to the fold eventually earning the respect of his father and his brother both of them detectives in the NYPD. This redemption is hard won accomplished through suffering and personal sacrifice and at the end we find ourselves pondering how much this sympathetic strangely innocent soul has lost in the process. When the movie begins Phoenixs character who calls himself Bobby Green has already carved out an identity for himself. Hes the main man at the El Caribe a thriving hotspot bankrolled by a gregarious Russian businessman who treats him like a son. His loyal lieutenant is also his best friend. And hes crazy in love with his hot Puerto Rican girlfriend Amada (Eva Mendes). Everything is on the up. Greens family the Grusinskys are a different tribe Burt (Robert Duvall) is a veteran cop who cant stomach what his younger son is doing with his life. Joseph (Mark Wahlberg) Greens older brother is the white sheep quickly rising through the ranks and newly assigned to lead a narcotics task force that has one of Bobbys regular customers in its sights. When Joseph is hospitalized fortunate to have survived a point-blank shooting Bobby realizes his old man will be targeted next and agrees to infiltrate the drug operation. The bad guys havent guessed that Green and Grusinsky are family. Now you dont have to be a pop-savvy Tarantino wannabe to recognize that Grays story might have made a serviceable vehicle for the likes of James Cagney and Spencer Tracy back in the 1930s. If you think you can guess where its headed youre very probably right. (And if you object that it seems improbable I wouldnt disagree with you there either.) But Gray takes these somewhat soiled and contrived narrative elements and shapes them into a plangent suspense thriller thats at once archetypal and subtly subversive. Phoenix starred with Wahlberg in Grays ""The Yards"" some years back and watching him in these pictures you appreciate what a great film noir actor he would have made. Theres something wounded about him a vulnerability thats attractive but can also turn rancid. He knows something integral is broken but he desperately needs to be fixed. Eva Mendes makes a strong case that Amada is the answer to his dreams (anyones dreams for that matter). Shes tender sexy and assertive ready to fight his corner if only hell stick beside her. But in the end blood begets blood you cant choose your family or escape from where you came from. There will be a closing of the ranks. Wreathed in gloom and doom ""We Own the Night"" is shot with dark authority by Joaquin Baca-Asay. Three set pieces stand out. In one a tense undercover assignment in a drug factory turns into a terrifying savage bloodbath. In the second a rainstorm transforms a conventional car chase into treacherous slick of chaos and confusion. And in the third a manhunt in a field of wild reeds becomes a hellish inferno that demands a reckoning. In each instance Gray pushes a generic situation to an expressionistic crisis point -- and Bobby forfeits another ounce of his humanity. Time will tell but from where Im sitting this deceptively routine cop movie runs deep. In fact it already looks like a classic. Cagney and Tracy would be proud. ""We Own the Night"" is rated R and runs 117 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

Friday October 12 2007 400 AM We Own the Night. Crime drama pitting an errant son against a brother and father who are cops. With Joaquin Phoenix Mark Wahlberg Robert Duvall. Director James Gray (157). R Language violence drug use. At area theaters. Until a pair of ludicrous plot twists throw it off its rails writer-director James Grays ""We Own the Night"" is a first-rate urban thriller and family drama something Sidney Lumet might have directed. But Lumet would have never made the mistakes Gray has; his New York dramas are so rooted in realism they seem to be playing out in real time and with no predictable outcome. Not so ""We Own the Night."" Like Grays first two movies ""Little Odessa"" and ""The Yards"" this one hangs on the notion of fate and once youve figured out whose fate is the central issue the outcome - even with those clumsy plot twists - is fairly predictable. Set in the late 80s this Cain and Abel takeoff stars Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix as brothers Joe and Bobby Grusinski. Their dad (Robert Duvall) is a deputy police chief and Joe has just made his pop proud by being promoted to captain on the same force. Bobby meanwhile is on a fast track running a mob-owned nightclub in Brighton Beach filling his nose with free cocaine and keeping a tight rein on his Puerto Rican girlfriend Amada (Eva Mendes). Family tensions are high and about to get higher as Joe threatens a raid on Bobbys club which is operating central for a ruthless Russian drug lord. When Joe carries out the threat and puts both himself and his dad on the killers contract list Bobby is forced to make a choice. For the first half of the movie while establishing the family tensions and the club milieu that Bobby has naively adopted ""We Own the Night"" has a good sense of pace and atmosphere. Though Vadim (Alex Veadov) the cold-blooded Russian thug is a cliche the whole thing works well enough. But when it goes wrong specifically when Bobby is given a badge like an angry Earp brother in ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" the story turns into something barely at the level of a TV cop show. jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post If ""We Own the Night"" were a cop it would resemble a uniformed lifer whos walked his beat for so many years his arches have fallen. Even so as flat-footed as writer-director James Grays script often sounds his cops-vs.-mob tale can be strangely mesmerizing. Credit much of this magnetism to Joaquin Phoenix. As Bobby Green the black sheep in a family of New Yorks finest the actor continues to ripen. While brother Joseph and father Burt Grusinsky toe the thin blue line in a city overrun with gangs Bobby manages a New York dance club. Owned by Marat Bujayev a grandfatherly Russian who made money in the fur trade ""Brooklyns best club"" is a thump-and-grind cavern. In contrast Bujayevs home is brightly lit full of giggling grandkids and zaftig mamas. Set in the late 1980s ""We Own the Night"" earns its R rating fast. Bobby and lovely paramour Amanda (Eva Mendes) indulge each other on the office sofa. Louis (Danny Hoch) Bobbys righthand man bangs on the door. Call it seat-squirming interruptus. Bobby has ambitions all the way to Manhattan. But his choice of trusted associate and his fondness for casual drug use suggests hes not as ready as he imagines. ""We Own the Night"" quickly sets up how old-school Bobbys kin are. Youd have to scan long and hard in a celebration in a church basement full of cops and their wives to find signs that we havent been catapulted into the 1950s. When Bobby and Amanda arrive decked out in clubbing finery the interracial couple has taken a giant step back in time. Robert Duvall is Burt Grusinsky. A tough old bantam he wears his disdain for Bobbys choices stretched thin across his face. Mark Wahlberg plays eldest son Joseph who has a chest full of medals and even less patience for his brother. It doesnt take much time spent in their company to see why Bobby took his mothers name why he doesnt want anyone he works with to know his roots. They ask Bobby to help them nail - or at least stay out of the way while they nail - a Russian dealing drugs out of the club. Vadim is the owners nephew. A subsequent raid sets in motion the return of the prodigal son. Joseph is shot in retaliation for the bust. And the lines between black and white are redrawn for Bobby. ""We Own the Night"" is bent on making a fairly obvious point The Russians arent the only ones who value family. Still the scene in a boxing gym when Burt gets news of Josephs shooting is nearly worth the price of the ticket. Gray has a firmer grasp on the visual rhythms of his atmospheric film than its dialogue which can elicit snickers. Throughout are glimpses of a more intriguing argument Gangsters arent the only ones with rituals and unspoken codes. Cops can be made men too. Witness the group of tight-lipped detectives gathered round Burt after Josephs been shot. They want to go to the mattresses. Wahlberg and Duvall do get to deliver a couple of gems of cop wisdom. Suiting up to mete out justice Joseph reminds Bobby (in Wahlbergs trademark whisper) ""Its better to be judged by 12 than carried by six.""

"We Own the Night Departed lite | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWe Own the Night Departed liteWith so many filmmakers evoking the unsettled vibe of 1970s crime stories definitely a laudable obsession it was only a matter of time before retro began to feel repetitive.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 12 2007Starring Robert Duvall Mark Wahlberg Joaquin Phoenix and Eva Mendes. Written and directed by James Gray. 114 minutes. At major theatres. 18A  Article Continued BelowEven good fads run their course.With so many filmmakers evoking the unsettled vibe of 1970s crime stories definitely a laudable obsession it was only a matter of time before retro began to feel repetitive.James Grays We Own the Night might be that time. Its not that its so terrible but it is terribly similar to so many other police dramas at the movies and on TV.Set in the late 1980s its a tale of two Brooklyn brothers on opposite sides of the law.Lt. Joseph Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg) is a proud New York cop the apple of his dads eye. No surprise there since dad Burt Grusinsky (Robert Duvall) is deputy chief of the NYPD.The other brother is Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix) who is at odds with the family firm. Bobby manages the popular El Caribe nightclub which is run by a Russian mobster. Bobby enjoys a toot of coke he has a girlfriend (Eva Mendes) made for sinning and he doesnt want anyone to know about his police connections - hence the pseudonym for a last name. How Bobby manages to pull off anonymity in this context is anybodys guess. His boss Marat Bujayev (Moni Moshonov) is no dummy and nothing seems likely to get by him.The same goes for Bujayevs bad-ass nephew Vadim (Alex Veadov) a big-time drug dealer looking to expand his turf. Bobby becomes the taffy in a pull between good and evil. Vadim conscripts Bobby to assist the sale of a potent new drug that is starting to take Manhattan while at the same time Joseph wants Bobby to rat out his criminal contacts. The cops swoop down on El Caribe one night resulting in a chain of events that will severely test family bonds including a point-blank shooting that defies medical science.Writer/director Gray has been working on We Own the Night for some seven years ever since his under-appreciated The Yards (also starring Wahlberg and Phoenix) stumbled from want of studio support and promotion.Had he released the film sooner before The Departed and Eastern Promises traversed similar dark corridors with louder footprints he might have been ahead of the 1970s retro curve rather than at the end of it. All of the performances in We Own the Night are adequate but none of them are remarkable - and that could just be because Duvall Wahlberg and Phoenix are victims of their own competence. We know theyre all capable of better.Its ironic that a lesser work like this would get a bigger push than either The Yards or Little Odessa another impressive Gray picture. We Own the Night debuted in competition at Cannes last May where it was greeted with catcalls for lines like ""Dont be a hero"" and ""Its a war out there.""At least it has a great car chase one of the best Ive seen in ages. That too is highly derivative of 1970s films.

ANNE JOYCE Movie review ""We Own the Night"" with Joaquin Phoenix Mark Wahlberg Robert Duvall. Written and directed by James Gray. 117 minutes. Rated R for strong violence drugs language some sexual content and brief nudity. Several theaters. Movie review James Grays third film about New York criminals ""We Own the Night"" may not have much new to say about the war on drugs. But it says it awfully well and its a notable improvement on Grays hitman drama ""Little Odessa"" (1994) and his previous Mark Wahlberg/Joaquin Phoenix vehicle ""The Yards"" (2000). Wahlberg and Phoenix are back in the new film not only as the stars but as producers. Both played criminals in ""The Yards"" but this time Wahlberg is a straight-arrow policeman and Phoenix is his shady brother a nightclub manager who doesnt seem to realize that hes living on the edge. Robert Duvall bringing conviction to a stock role plays their police-chief father who is proud of the formers success and ashamed of the latters prodigal behavior. Most telling is his reaction when he hears that one of them is hurt. After the family-man cop is shot and nearly killed his casually corrupt brother gradually develops a conscience exploiting friends and acquaintances to arrange revenge against the Russian mafia responsible for the attack. But hes conflicted He still likes his nose candy; his girlfriend (Eva Mendes) doesnt want to rock the boat; and he doesnt necessarily excel at betrayal. Its a meaty role for Phoenix who emphasizes the range of emotions that must come from trying to serve two families one official the other largely illegal but no less powerful in its hold on him (hes even changed his name from Grusinsky to Green to underline his dual identity). Wahlberg at first seems to have only one note to play -- his tough law-abiding character brutally rejects his brother at one point -- but the character takes some surprising turns. Hes allowed some vulnerability. The story begins in 1988 in a jampacked Brooklyn disco where cocaine is the drug of choice and a booming rendition of ""Heart of Glass"" engulfs attempts at conversation. With a minimum of fuss and production values Gray successfully evokes the period. Hes also created an adrenaline-rush of a car chase that works partly because it takes place in the driving rain. While the cars perform their expected bits -- including that old favorite jumping lanes and driving the wrong way on a one-way street -- so much of what they do is a blur. And a very stylish and scary blur it is.

Photo Anne Joyce Review Brothers clash in We Own the Night 1 / 2 Back to Gallery We Own the Night Drama. Starring Joaquin Phoenix Mark Wahlberg Eva Mendes and Robert Duvall. Directed by James Gray. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Theres a point of view thats hinted at in ""We Own the Night"" without quite being endorsed. The idea is that its better to run a nightclub than to be a cop. Its better to have good times than get shot at. Its better to spend your time with your glamorous girlfriend than drab police officers and violent criminals. And its better to enjoy life than go after drug dealers because its pointless anyway - cut off the monsters head and it sprouts two or three more. Thats what ""We Own the Night"" seems to want to say but boxed into the dictates of a crime thriller it can only hint at it. These hints are welcome. Theyre not what people expect and had the writer-director pursued these ideas beyond the hinting stage he might have created something morally complicated and unusual. But as the movie stands these half-formed ideas are in conflict with the main thrust of the film which seems to be all about getting the bad guys - and about a fun-loving but irresponsible young man finding his inner virtue. So things are a little off. The style is gritty 1970s-style crime thriller but the morals are straight out of 2007 and the movie is set in 1988. Why 1988? Its hard to say except that Eva Mendes looks good in high hair. Joaquin Phoenix plays the manager of the hottest nightclub in New York but on the dance floor people are shaking it up to ""Rapture"" from 1980 and ""Heart of Glass"" from 1978. These imprecisions are minor but theyre symptomatic. ""We Own the Night"" is a robust respectable cop movie that was just a few adjustments and maybe one full screenplay draft away from being something a lot more pointed and significant. The movie takes its title from the motto of the NYPDs street crimes unit but from the opening moments we know that theyre kidding themselves. If anybody owns the night its Joaquin Phoenix as Bobby whose life is one big party - snorting cocaine with the customers and cavorting with his sexy girlfriend (Mendes). His bosses love him and are probably going to have him manage a club in Manhattan. Only two people think hes a loser his father (Robert Duvall) the police chief and his brother (Mark Wahlberg) a grim-faced cop. But next to him they seem prosaic and unimaginative. In fact next to him they seem stupid and determined to drag him down to their level. They treat him like a black-sheep disaster and yet they expect him to act as a spy and report to them about drug transactions at the club. ""Sooner or later"" his father tells him ""youre going to be with us or the drug dealers."" That sentence alone suggests a rigidness of mind that a son would want to flee from not embrace. From there the screenplay cleverly sets up early in the story a situation in which Bobby cant help but be pulled into his father and brothers anti-drug crusade. He doesnt want to be but under the circumstances he has no choice. The movie implies that having a family in law enforcement is a terrible misfortune to have befallen such a fun-loving and upwardly mobile fellow as Bobby. But it never fully acknowledges it and as ""We Own the Night"" moves forward it gradually shakes down in conventional terms. The problem is not that the movies point of view is too subtle or complex but rather that it becomes indistinct and contradictory. The movie becomes too much like any another good guys/bad guys saga. Working within the formula the picture has its strong points. Gray propels the story forward and just when you think hes boxed into one plot he wriggles out of it and comes up with something else. He needs to muscle the story because the storys engine - Bobbys motivation - is barely there. Everything Bobby does he does out of vague family guilt and guilt is not a dynamic motivator. Duvall and Wahlberg play hard cases and its no surprise they do it well. Mendes role deepens over the course of the story and so does her performance. And Phoenix is especially strong at conveying Bobbys internal life the stress the fear the twisted family dynamic everything hes running from everything hes running toward. With a little more help from the script Phoenix could have turned this into something special. -- Advisory Sexual situations strong language and violence.

Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg are brothers on opposite sides of the law Phoenixs Bobby has changed his name from Grusinsky and manages a dance club/drug supermarket in 1988 Brooklyn. Wahlberg plays a cop who along with his father (Robert Duvall) a deputy chief in the department tries to persuade Bobby to snitch on the drug bosses he knows. While Bobby wanders through the first half of the movie trying to make up his mind - the Russians who own his club have no idea hes from a cop family and would shoot him if they found out he talked - the drug war is exploding and the dance floor is writhing to the beat of . . . Blondie? In 1988? Familiar scenes of backroom cocaine preparation cops wiring up informants and a couple of shootouts work efficiently enough but only twice does the movie live down to its pretensions to make you taste New York dirtbag living. Bobby pursued by a few dozen bullets leaps out of a window only to discover hes higher off the ground than he thought and his fall will be broken by the ouchy end of a chain-link fence. And a moody dread-soaked car chase in the rain with a throbbing musical pulse recalls John Williams work for ""Munich."" The latter scene tense and gray and frightening though it is is nearly ruined by implausible mechanics as is the overall plot. This is the kind of flick where a guy can be a completely untrained civilian on Wednesday and a member of the most elite SWAT team in the city on Thursday. Heres your shotgun pal hope you can figure out how to use it. Breaking out of a New York City jail in the 1980s is presented as no more challenging than making Barney Fife look the other way while you steal his key ring and a hit man who shoots a defenseless guy in the head from three feet away causes only a cheek injury. ""Definitely a professional"" mutters a grizzled investigator about the crime. Professional busboy maybe. The movie is soulfully paced as it scrabbles for a feel of grand tragedy but if youre going to pass yourself off as an art film you have to do better than dial-a-cliche dialogue (""Its like a war out there"" ""Dont be a hero"" ""Hes a dead man"" ""We gotta find out where the deal is goin down""). Scorsese would have fired the writer but director James Gray unwisely kept himself around to do the script. Eva Mendes as Bobbys beautiful girlfriend has nothing to do unless you count walking sultrily in and out of the shadows and Phoenix who seems to be growing puffier by the movie is more mopey than tortured. At least the bullet-eyed Duvall supplies some brittle edges and hard wisdom Dan Rather-ish as it is ""You marry an ape you dont complain about the stench of bananas"" he says. Even better is ""When you [pee] in your pants you can only stay warm for so long."" Running time 117 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity drug use brief nudity). At the Sunshine the Kips Bay the Orpheum others.

Mark Wahlberg stars as Joseph Grusinsky in We Own the Night written and directed by James Gray. Photo Columbia Pictures/2929 Productions We Own the Night 1 / 2 Back to Gallery WeOwn The Night begins its story in 1988 but dont you believe it. From every angle this sturdy and programmatic crime drama looks like the 1970s. Police do battle with foreign drug lords on the streets of New York City. Gray skies cast a pall over crumbling buildings and graffiti-scarred walls. Boxy American cars chase and slam and careen under overpasses. At the climax a cop plays judge and jury with his gun. Sounds like The French Connection right? Close enough. Writer-director James Gray has gone and made The Russian Connection a solid-looking and earnestly acted rehash of several durable cliches. It slides toward boring now and then most often when the dialogue gets obvious or the music gets trite; there is really no need for dirgelike violins when the mustachioed villain vows to kill the hero. But Grays craftsmanship is admirable which shows some old-fashioned reverence for the triangulated composition of Scene Character Plot and avoids by and large the snazzy edits and visual bling that pass for a cinematic imagination these days. He takes a few interesting cracks at P.O.V. (and one unfortunate turn with the hand-held camera) but the rest of the time he seems content to sit tight while men and shadows do their job. Just watch as Joaquin Phoenix enters a drug lords stash house and walks a dim hallway into blackness It isnt subtle but it works. Phoenix never a dull boy brings his eruptive masculine turbulence to a role that forces him to look wounded angry determined swinging and craven sometimes all at once. As Bobby the proverbial Bad Brother in a family of clean-cut Brooklyn cops he plays a few key scenes opposite Mark Wahlberg as Joe the proverbial Good Brother who followed his upright pop (Robert Duvall) onto the force. Bobby manages a slick 80s nightclub called El Caribe. Joe heads up a narcotics investigation into the powerful Nezhinski (Alex Veadov) a Russian drug dealer and club habitue who bears the deadened eyes and tightened pony tail of a stone-cold psychopath. Hes a much less colorful brute than any of the tattooed Russian mobsters in Eastern Promises and Im not sure what hes doing in Brooklyn before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 91. Joe and Pop whom everyone calls ""Chief"" want Bobby to ""observe"" Nezhinski and help with the investigation. Bobby balks. He likes his life at El Caribe -- snorting coke snuggling with his woman (Eva Mendes) snacking on Russian pastries at the owners home across the street. Its not his responsibility if police are getting whacked by bad guys every other day. Enter the raspy paternal authority of Robert Duvall who admonishes ""Sooner or later youre either gonna be with us or youre gonna be with the drug dealers. Its a war out there."" Anyone whos watched enough movies knows that sooner trumps later that choosing up sides is often a violent process and that the war out there always always gets waged in the vicinity of a squalid warehouse. Also evident here are the crime-and-family motifs that dominated Grays previous two films Little Odessa and The Yards (Wahlberg and Phoenix) along with a painterly gift for setting and framing moods. But the dialogue. But the platitudes. But the end. Strong actors can carry a film a long way but what is it theyre carrying anyway? Lines such as this ""All that matters is that we finish this.""

"Joaquin Phoenix owns the darkly brooding Night - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs ABOUT THE MOVIEWe Own the Night   (out of four)Stars Joaquin Phoenix Mark Wahlberg Robert Duvall Eva MendesDirector James GrayDistributor Columbia PicturesRating R for strong violence drug material language some sexual content brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 57 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Joaquin Phoenix owns the darkly brooding Night Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The theme of this absorbing crime drama centers on a simple idea Blood is thicker than powder. Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg play brothers who have chosen radically different paths. Wahlberg is a cop like their father (an always great Robert Duvall) and Phoenix manages a nightclub and runs with a coked-out crowd. (The story is set in the late 80s which the soundtrack heavy on Blondie and Bowie reminds us potently.) Duvall regards Wahlberg as the familys fair-haired boy while Phoenix with his shady job is an embarrassment. Phoenix is unfazed by the familial contempt and is content to keep his distance until Wahlberg is attacked by a Russian gangster (Alex Veadov) associated with Phoenixs nightclub. The assault on his brother galvanizes him and Phoenix offers to spy on a ruthless Russian-dominated cocaine operation. But hes not the only one at risk with his surveillance efforts Hes imperiling his girlfriend (Eva Mendes) too. Though its not quite film noir We Own the Night has a darkly brooding style that suits the material. Screenwriter/director James Gray (The Yards) does a better job directing than writing. Some of the story becomes melodramatic and the dialogue can be banal but the performances are strong marked by conflicted emotions. There are some well-played lines such as ""Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6"" along with such prosaic exhortations as ""Youre going to get yourself killed"" The movie really belongs to Phoenix who gives a haunting performance with just the right degree of intensity. Though the story -- a cops-vs.-gangsters contest with undercurrents of a Cain-and-Abel saga -- is not breaking any new ground it has a resounding redemptive quality that draws us in.

Bobby (Phoenix) is the proverbial black sheep a coke-snorting disco-club manager with a different last name - Green - a party-girl girlfriend (Eva Mendes) and business associates who may or may not be tied to the Russian mob.One thing the brothers do share a hero father Burt Grusinsky a deputy police chief played exactly how you figure hed be played if he were being played by Robert Duvall - which he is.At times solid and suspenseful at times dopily implausible and woefully familiar We Own the Night owes a bunch to the bare-knuckled New York crime dramas of Sidney Lumet - though it doesnt come close to Lumets latest opening next month (and also about two brothers and a father) Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead.We Own the Night is the stylish efficient if derivative work of writer/director James Gray whose previous forays - Little Odessa The Yards - were likewise New York stories with Russian crime-world motifs. The film set in the big-car big-hair 1980s gives Phoenix and Wahlberg the chance to try out their New Yawk accents and strut some serious actor stuff but theres not much depth to these characters unless you count the depth accrued by decades worth of similar movies similar roles.Still if you buy the premise that no one outside of his immediate family knows that Bobby Green is connected to the Grusinsky cops clan We Own the Night does deliver jolts of pulse-quickening drama. With Joe seriously injured on an NYPD bust Bobby agrees to go undercover to rat out the drug-dealing scum responsible for his siblings shooting. Sweat beads collect on Phoenixs forehead as he walks into the lair a wire neatly hidden in his cigarette lighter.But why wonders the suspicious Russian thug is Bobby carrying a lighter and a book of matches? Whats up with that?Gray manages to give Mendes more to work with than the usual gangsters-moll material - her Amada may be out for a good time but the actress character comes across as genuine and genuinely afraid for the guy she loves. And the director orchestrates a terrific car-chase sequence a virtuoso piece of movie action set in a torrential daytime downpour that brings visibility to zero and brings cars careening into one another as bullets pop bumpers thud and bad things happen to folks were meant to care about.We Own the Night 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by James Gray.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 12 2007 Save for later Saved ""We Own the Night"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix is set in 1988 in pre-Giuliani New York City when crime was pandemic and the Russian mob was moving in on the Mafia. Theres almost a wistfulness to the approach of writer-director James Gray as if he was saying ""New York may be cleaner now but back then the movie material was much better.""Gray is primarily interested in a New York City of the mind. His movie is a caldron of melodramatic tropes from other movies about the riven families of cops and criminals and yet for the most part he has enough flair as a director to make this derivative world his own.Wahlberg plays Joseph Grusinky a decorated cop whose father Burt (Robert Duvall) is the citys deputy police chief. Josephs brother Bobby (Phoenix) is the family outcast. While Joseph and Burt are leading the charge to take back the streets Bobby who hides his family ties from his friends and business associates manages a Russian-owned nightclub in Brooklyn that also serves as unofficial headquarters for the cops number one-targeted drug kingpin Vadim Nezhinski (Alex Veadov). Bobby doesnt want any part of police- work and turns down their request to help. ""You want me to inform?"" he asks as if he were being asked to foul himself. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gray who previously made the impressive ""Little Odessa"" and ""The Yards"" has a sinuous camera style that pulls us into the brackish allure of the underworld. Bobbys nightclub is a vast multitiered emporium that he navigates often high on dope with delirious aplomb. He is also high on his sultry girlfriend Amanda (Eva Mendes) who acts as hostess in the club. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Bobby is clearly headed for a fall and just in case we didnt get it Gray keeps pumping up the Greek chorus. When Joseph and then Burt and finally Bobby are targeted by the Russians for instance Amanda helpfully lets it be known that ""the walls are closing in.""Bobby fulfills his destiny as a hero and even though he seems temperamentally ill-fitted for the role he has no choice in the matter. Its fate - I mean Fate. But Gray leaves a lot of questions hanging. How for example is Bobby able to keep secret from the mob the fact that his father and brother are top cops? He is not after all very discreet - Amanda already knows - and the Russians arent stupid. And yet the entire plot turns on this secret.Gray also is careful not to weigh down Bobbys heroic ascent with too many negatives. Although he uses drugs recreationally Bobby is no dealer and keeps his hands clean which given his world and his position is not very believable. He is also catastrophically naive in his choice of professional alliances - even an 8-year-old would able to spot the cracks in the ""kindly"" Russian club owner.And yet when Phoenix is flying high his performance is enough to make you believe in this man. And Duvall in what must be the eight-hundredth terrific performance of his career gives Burt a dignity that never stultifies into sainthood. Gray loves actors and it shows.He also loves the sheer release of physical movement and this serves him best in a rain-slicked highway car chase near the end with the Russians in pursuit of Bobby and his father. The scene is shot almost entirely from Bobbys perspective and the metronomic sound of his windshield wipers is like a death knell.Its awfully difficult at this point in film history to come up with a car chase thats startlingly new but Gray pulls it off. Its the best of its kind since ""The French Connection."" Grade B+Rated R for strong violence drug material sexual content and brief nudity.

"We Own the Night | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; we-own-the-night ) We Own the Night (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Loyalty. Betrayal. Violence. Family. Those are the crucial staples to be found in any crime drama worth viewing and writer/director James Gray shoehorns them into his high wattage effort We Own the Night. Despite a plot that occasionally creaks and groans under the weight of a few too many coincidences and contrivances We Own the Night offers effective drama and enough suspense to ensure that audiences will stay put until the end credits roll. And even though Joaquin Phoenix gives a less-than-stellar performance in the lead role were still interested to know where the character arc will take this ambiguous individual. Lifestyle choices define the separation between brothers Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix) and Joseph (Mark Wahlberg). Joe has followed in the footsteps of his gruff father Burt (Robert Duvall) and entered the New York City police force. Bobby on the other hand has turned his back on the family calling and now manages an upscale Brooklyn night club. His lifestyle is fast and furious involving a sexy girlfriend Amada (Eva Mendes) and a lot of partying. However the club is the haven of drug dealer Vadim Nezhinski (Alex Veadov) who has connections to the Russian Mob (a suddenly hot source of movie villains - see David Cronenbergs Eastern Promises) and things come to a head one night when a task force led by Joe conducts a raid. Shortly thereafter Joe has been shot in the face and Bobby finds his loyalties torn. As was true of his previous feature The Yards (which also starred Phoenix and Wahlberg) Grays story is riddled with holes and logical flaws. For example its tough to swallow that big-time well-connected drug dealers dont do a background check on someone theyre planning to show their operation to (such a check would have revealed Bobbys family connections to the police department). And are we supposed to believe that a single car can take out a small convoy of cops escorting a witness? Little things like this dont sink We Own the Night but they make it hard to applaud the movie unreservedly. What Gray does right is to develop the family dynamics between Bobby Joseph and Burt. The interpersonal relationships between these three holds the movie together and proves to be more interesting than the crime elements. By being the maverick Bobby has all-but-turned his back on his family and as a result holds a basement spot in his fathers thoughts and affections. The always-dutiful Joe on the other hand is the apple of Burts eye while secretly being jealous of the freedom his brother enjoys. The falling-out that occurs is inevitable given the circumstances but couldnt come at a worse time. While there is a fair amount of tension during the final 20 minutes events unfold in a relatively predictable manner (although the setting is at least unique). Ultimately though its a lot more interesting watching Bobby trying to come to grips with his potential culpability in his brothers shooting than it is watching him chase down a bad guy in a corn field. While certain elements of the plot hearken back to the disappointing The Yards the complexity of the characters and the ways in which they interact is more reminiscent of Grays superior first movie Little Odessa. Despite a strong cast We Own the Night doesnt boast any memorable performances. Joaquin Phoenix plays the role like hes perpetually drunk or high frequently mumbling or slurring his lines. Mark Wahlberg and Robert Duvall are solid but not spectacular. Eva Mendes is sexy especially during her introduction scene but shes pretty much stuck in the thankless girlfriend part. There are times when it looks like she might be on the verge of breaking free of her scripted constraints but it never quite happens. The screenplay isnt interested in the female characters. (Joes wife is virtually invisible and Burt is a widower). With a cast like this one has a right to expect something amazing so the fact that We Own the Night is merely ""entertaining"" might cause disappointment in some quarters. As cop/crime dramas go this one offers little thats new but it takes the time to develop the characters and thats where its strengths lie. Remove this aspect and all that would remain is a generic story about a mini-war between Russian mobsters and New York City cops circa 1988. Credit Gray for at least giving us more meat than that to chew on.

"We Own the Night Lost in Its Own Shadows washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments We Own the Night Lost in Its Own Shadows Network News X Profile View More Activity Play Video TRAILER | We Own the Night TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 12 2007 For people deeply into movies Mark Wahlberg plus Joaquin Phoenix times James Gray equals one case of anticipatory goose bumps The two simpatico actors starred in Grays terrific 2000 drama ""The Yards"" in which they executed one of the finest naturalistic fight scenes ever captured on screen. This StoryWe Own the Night Lost in Its Own ShadowsVIDEO We Own the NightIn Focus Joaquin Phoenix Hollywoods Reluctant Star While ""We Own the Night"" doesnt quite deliver on the promise of that earlier film it has its moments at least when Phoenix is in a scene. Gray has cast him and Wahlberg as brothers living in Brooklyn in the 1980s on conflicting sides of escalating drug wars. Phoenixs Bobby is a high-living club manager with a hot equally party-hearty girlfriend (Eva Mendes). Meanwhile straight-arrow Joseph (Wahlberg) has gone ""on the job"" joining their dad (Robert Duvall) on the city police force. When a case Joseph is working on involving the Russian mob strikes closer to home for Bobby years of estrangement between the men come to a head in brutal encounters and shocking reversals. Like Tony Gilroy (director of the much more accomplished ""Michael Clayton"") Gray looks back to 1970s cinema for inspiration in ""We Own the Night"" which opens with grainy black-and-white photographs of drug busts and presumably real New York cops (the title is taken from the motto of the forces street crimes unit in the 1980s). With its washed-out palette of grays and blues its Scorsese-esque scenes of domestic life in Brooklyns Polish and Puerto Rican households and a bravura car chase that recapitulates the classic sequence from William Friedkins ""The French Connection"" the films cinematic antecedents are clear. But too often the story of filial competition and loyalty seems shoehorned into preconceived set pieces. Wahlberg and Phoenix dont have much screen time together and when they do Wahlberg is oddly inert. Coming off his incandescent turn in ""The Departed"" his muted diffident mumble is especially disappointing in a movie where the same crackling wit and energy are sorely needed. For his part Phoenix convincingly dispels thoughts of ""Whats Johnny Cash doing at the Limelight in 1988?"" slipping easily into his role as a morally ambiguous lounge lizard and commanding the screen with transfixing power. Hes at the center of the standout scenes Gray seems to have organized ""We Own the Night"" around including that car chase (given added visual oomph by some impressive computer-generated rain) a tense interlude at an eerily quiet drug den and the films payoff set in a burning field of feathery grass. This climactic sequence is completely gratuitous and improbable one of many loopholes Gray chooses in favor of a visually arresting flourish. Meanwhile human relationships not to mention a crucial shift in one characters arc are given maddeningly short shrift as Mendess character disappears perfunctorily and someone whos supposed to be under heavy police protection suddenly turns up in a particularly perilous old haunt. Both Bobby and Joseph are put through cringe-inducing physical punishments in a cop thriller that slathers on generous helpings of melodrama with its brutality. The problem with ""We Own the Night"" is that it never seems to decide what it wants to be a tough atmospheric urban crime flick or a florid family soap. (When Ed Koch turns up in a cameo its difficult to discern if its a gesture toward realism or camp.) The movies chief pleasure its stellar cast is also the source of its most confounding frustrations as the actors performances never quite meld into the sharply focused ensemble the movie calls for. Maybe the best way to put it is that theres plenty of Night in ""We Own the Night"" just not enough We. We Own the Night (117 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong violence drug material profanity sexual content and brief nudity. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2007 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  We Own the Night Lost in Its Own Shadows Joaquin Phoenix Hollywoods Reluctant Star VIDEO We Own the Night",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/11/AR2007101102297.html,200,weownthenight21,weownthenight,washingtonpost

The writer-director James Gray is desperate to make a movie that would join their ranks but the trouble with his films which include Little Odessa The Yards and the new We Own the Night is that he doesnt earn mythology. He imposes it from above. Set in New York in the high party days of 1988 We Own the Night tells the charged tale of two brothers. Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix) a dissolute hellion with a crooked smile and a diamond stud in his ear manages a vast nightclub built out of an old movie theater. Joseph (Mark Wahlberg) his opposite number is a decorated cop assigned to a narcotics task force which leads him to shake down a drug dealer operating out of Bobbys club. I wont divulge more except to say that the film is full of showy set pieces and a handful of them are smashingly done. A variation on the guy-wearing-a-wire-during-a-drug-deal bit had me sucking in my breath; a car chase shot in the drenching rain is violent tumultuous and original. And yet...the story is too patterned and too contrived. (How could a hustler like Bobby be this naive about the clubs ""kindly"" owner?) Its like a more abstract Godfather in moral reverse with one key figure undergoing a transformative spiritual rebirth I never fully bought. Gray is a far better director than he is a writer. Hes got the talent to make great movies. He just needs to stop trying to.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Whats It All About Anyway? Sleuth is Pinter lite (a relief); We Own the Night does basically. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Columbia Pictures) In talking about his cops-versus-Russian-gangsters movie We Own the Night the writer and director James Gray cites the ancient Greeks idea that ones life is shaped primarily by forces outside of ones control as if the gods had dealt each person a fatea destiny. In cinema though theres a thin line between classical destiny and modern formula idiocy. Oedipuss destiny is to kill his father and sleep with his mother; the average movie cops destiny is to cross the line into bad-guy territory by breaking all the rules to avenge the murder of his fat (or African-American or Asian-American) partner. Grays premise is right on the Sophocles/Joe Eszterhas border. The film centers on two brothersone (Joaquin Phoenix) a druggie and the manager of a shady nightclub the other (Mark Wahlberg) a cop with a broomstick up his butt. Dont stop me if youve heard this one because you have. The larger question is If Gray and his (great) actors see destiny where I see cliche will the strength of their belief make a difference to the finished productgive it a core of authenticity that lifts it out of the B-movie gutter? The answer is a guarded but affectionate yes. We Own the Night plays like gangbusters. Queens Russian gangbustersGray being a native of the borough and of Russian stock. Its 1988 a high point in the citys cocaine-fueled devastation and We Own the Night is the slogan of the street-crimes unit bailiwick of Captain Joseph Grusinsky (Wahlberg). Bobby (Phoenix) hasnt seen his brother or police-chief dad (Robert Duvall) in months. When he reluctantly shows up for Josephs decoration ceremony in a church basement hes stoned out of his mind and toting his Latina honey (Eva Mendes) as a shield. Thats when hes escorted by his dad and a phalanx of officers upstairs to the chapel and asked to work undercover the stakes reflected in the religious icons and the deep-toned pews. Destiny waits. The casting of Duvall is a kind of shorthand. The actor is so disciplined so marvelously at ease in his body that he stands effortlessly for the ultimate old-fashioned patriarch Who could measure up? Not Bobby who labors to define himself in opposition. Not Joseph who overcame dyslexia to triumph at the police academy but whose tightness signals inner panic. The brothers are in the same place only they wont admit it to themselves or each other. The conflict might be heavy-handed without Phoenixs facehis irresolution somehow more powerful than other actors resolve. There is no artifice. Hes not an actor disappearing into a role but a man disappearing into himself. Around his dad and brother Phoenixs Bobby looks physically ill as if their presence is toxic a threat to his freedom even his existence. When he does ultimately consent to cooperate the words seem to come from somewhere other than his headhalf-mumbled half-sighed as if theyve been inside him all along. Grays idea of character is a little pat for my taste but Phoenix homes in on the truth of this person. Its the paradox of the greatest acting By depicting a mans struggle to close himself down he opens himself up wider than any of us would dare. Apart from its smug villain (Alex Veadov)another Russian sociopath who hisses things to underlings like You talk to the police and I rape and disembowel your motherWe Own the Night has none of the usual genre bombast. Theres little in the way of musicits mostly an ambient whine mixed with cars on wet streets and passing planes. The feel is seventies New York realism. That said the film is considerably more commercial (and splattery) than Grays last The Yards which was slow almost groggy The light seemed unable to pass through air thickened by corruption; the protagonist (Wahlberg again) moved through the bowels of Queens like a somnambulist. Here we get a car chase. A different kind of car chase though. Its all shot from Bobbys perspective behind a windshield in a hard rain and behind the action too. Even with his foot on the pedal the deluge makes it seem as if hes underwater unable to catch up unable to alter what he (and we) see coming from the proverbial mile away. Gray knows how to sell the idea of unalterable destiny with a car chase Thats the mark of a real action director. 1 2 Next Share this story...

""We Own the Night"" is an exceptionally conventional crime drama about Brooklyn brothers who find themselves on opposite sides of the law circa 1988. Adequately acted and flecked with the required quota of action to satisfy genre fans pic recalls numerous good police dramas of the 1970s but mostly in superficial ways that bring nothing new to the table. Acquired by Sony for North American release shortly before its world preem in competition at the Cannes Film Festival meller should ride its good cast and crime slant to reasonable B.O. returns. Director-writer James Gray enjoys a following on the fest circuit due to his previous two Gotham-set crimers ""Little Odessa"" and ""The Yards"" which scored in Venice and Cannes respectively but underperformed commercially. His first film in seven years ""We Own the Night"" again puts Russian gangsters at the center of things although this time up against Brooklyn cops in particular a Polish-American family so traditionally conceived that they would have been right at home in an MGM film of 1936. Yarn pivots on the troubled relationship between Joseph and Bobby Brooklyn brothers now in their 30s. At the outset theyve seen little of one another in ages as Joseph (Mark Wahlberg) followed in the footsteps of his father (Robert Duvall) to become a cop while Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix) has become a successful coked-up nightclub manager so anxious to distance himself from his straight-arrow family hes even changed his last name. No one Bobby works with knows hes from a police family least of all his boss genial old Russian Marat Bujayev (Moni Moshonov) whose sinister nephew Vadim (Alex Veadov) is well on his way to becoming Gothams biggest drug dealer. The dramatic vice tightens when Vadim an unsavory regular at the El Caribe club suggests Bobby join him in his narcotics business just as the Brooklyn cops announce theyre going to get tough on drugs and Joseph asks Bobby to be an informer. When Joseph leads a raid on El Caribe Bobby and Vadim are both arrested. But no sooner is Vadim released for lack of evidence than he tracks down the earnest cop in front of his house and shoots him execution style. Joseph miraculously survives while Bobby sees the light and nervously agrees to infiltrate Vadims operation as an undercover man. Several turns for the worse afflict the bumbling old-style police who are regarded contemptuously by Vadim before they remotely begin to turn the tables. And its a given that family life on both sides will never be the same when all is said and done. Simply because of the setup with its elemental emotions family bonds and conflicts and stark good guy-bad guy delineations the story pulls the viewer in. Gray also creates two or three effective set pieces notably a scary car chase in a torrential (and computer-generated) downpour that are undeniably arresting. After that reactions to the film will depend greatly upon ones degree of personal tolerance for dramatic implausibilities plot loopholes emotional cliches and period anachronisms. To begin with the latter viewers familiar with Brooklyn in the late 80s will know that a giant glitzy disco along the lines of the films El Caribe (clearly patterned upon Manhattans Limelight) never existed there at the time; Blondies ""Heart of Glass"" played at the outset is a song one would choose to position ones film in 1978 not a decade later; clothing and geographic details are off and even a famous commercial overheard on a car radio is from the incorrect period. When small things like these which will not bother young or unalert viewers are wrong one loses confidence in the authority being exercised over larger issues. And with good reason. As the story motors along the puzzling gaffes and unacceptable contrivances accumulate to an extent that becomes far too great to swallow or ignore. A villain miraculously eludes a police vice not just once but twice; police dont augment their level of self-protection despite knowing theyre marked men; Bobby absents himself from his club job for an inordinate period seemingly without raising the suspicions of his boss or associates; and one character acts rashly during the dramatic climax entering a burning field of tall grasses when it seems not only unnecessary but inadvisable except for the striking visual opportunities that doing so will provide. Performances are solid but unsurprising. Phoenix frets and sweats as his character becomes increasingly squeezed Wahlberg is not as lively or dimensional as he was in either ""The Departed"" or ""Shooter"" and Duvall can do this sort of crusty old cop in his sleep. As Bobbys squeeze Eva Mendes convincingly plays the slide of an enthusiastic party girls feelings as her mate drags her into aggravating jeopardy and isolation. Veadov is understated venality itself as the aspiring king of New York. Twenty years on former mayor Ed Koch amusingly appears as himself. Ultimately ""We Own the Night"" plays like little more than an OK television movie which is hardly enough after years of ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire.""
