Starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. Directed by Tim Burton. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Sleepy Hollow"" director Tim Burton gets to play with the most expensive creepy crawlers set in the world. Rubber heads roll fake blood sprays and animatronic animals squeal as theyre cut in two. If that sounds good think again. Imagine an irritating adolescent who fancies himself ghoulish. Imagine the workings of that mind. ""Sleepy Hollow"" has an aesthetic that seems based on album covers. It doesnt feel like the work of an artist in any way. The picture which opens today intensifies a dispiriting trend in movies. Its a film with no theatrical core and no integrity in the writing acting or storytelling. The jokes arent funny. The tone is uncertain. It invokes nothing real or fantastic. But it does assault the audience with a soundtrack that insists were experiencing everything were not experiencing. ""Sleepy Hollow"" calls into question Burtons reputation as a serious talent. What does it take to make a horror movie without a single scary moment? With no mood or atmosphere? All ""Sleepy Hollow"" has going for it is art direction and even in that it falls back on cliche. Everything is green and looks washed-out and diseased. The film based on Washington Irvings ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" stars Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane a New York City constable who goes to the small farming town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of bizarre murders. The year is 1799 and a headless horseman is going around cutting off heads and stealing them. We see one such murder when a bewigged Martin Landau riding in a carriage realizes that his coachman has no head. Moments later Landau has no head as well -- thus nipping in the bud what already looked sure to be a histrionic wallow of the worst kind. As Crane Depps performance is irrelevant in the best sense of the word. He has nothing to work with. Burtons direction is nonexistent and Andrew Kevin Walkers script is without a moment of tension or truth. So Depp comes up with stuff. He winces blinks sniffs purses his lips and acts fussy. Sometimes an actor can either mock the proceedings or go down with the ship. Depp finds the comedy. He fares better than Christina Ricci who is completely out of her depth. She plays Katrina the daughter of Van Tassel the wealthiest man in town. Ricci has always been an interesting actress and the blond wig is a nice touch but she has no business in a period film. Clearly intimidated by the dialogue she races through every line in an accent that mixes modern California with some barely digested vestiges of a dialect-coaching session. The scenes between Depp and Ricci -- and there are plenty -- are excruciatingly flat and call to mind Ed Woods films. At least Wood tried. Thats the charm of those B-movies. Burton working with more money than Wood ever dreamed of is bankrupt of inspiration. ""Sleep Hollow"" has no conviction no sincerity behind it. It does have the special-effects whoosh of a headless horseman galloping out from the bowels of hell through a hole in a tree and the momentary kick of seeing Christopher Walken growling like a maniac as the horseman in his earthly incarnation. That amounts to two minutes of amusement tops. After that all ""Sleepy Hollow"" has is a smart attitude as though its sending up the sort of genuinely frightening horror film its director is incapable of creating. Plus it has heads. Lots of bouncing heads. Fake blood and rubber-head aficionados should ""run not walk"" to this wretched pointless picture. ..

"Sleepy Hollow | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sleepy-hollow ) Sleepy Hollow (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli Tim Burtons Sleepy Hollow is as stylish and atmospheric as any motion picture to arrive in theaters this year. Unfortunately those aspects are its lone strengths. The film suffers from tepid performances feebly drawn characters and a meandering narrative. Regardless of how many eerie fog-shrouded forest sequences gruesome decapitations and gorgeous matte paintings Burton offers us Sleepy Hollows look cannot obfuscate its numerous glaring weaknesses. When I was about eight years old I became enthralled by Washington Irvings story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."" In a one month span (around Halloween) I devoured the tale six or seven times. Since then I dont think I have read the story of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman but the particulars are lodged in my brain and while Burton draws upon many of them (especially character names and general situations) he primarily uses Irvings story as a jumping-off point. And while ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" is too brief to fill out a full-length feature film without significant padding this version (credited to screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker) does a great disservice to its source material. Sleepy Hollow opens with a creepy sequence of great promise. The year is 1799 and the setting is a misty road near the small upstate New York hamlet of Sleepy Hollow. A coach carrying the wealthiest man in the district (Martin Landau in a cameo for Burton the man who directed him to an Oscar in Ed Wood) is set upon by a mysterious headless rider who with a slash of his sword deprives Sleepy Hollow of its most prominent citizen. Other equally grizzly deaths follow and in all cases the killer takes the victims head with him. The men and women of Sleepy Hollow are convinced that they are being haunted by the demonic spirit of a dead Hessian trooper who was slain in the Western Woods - a place into which no sane person will venture. Enter Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) a constable sent by a judge in New York City to solve the murders. Ichabod initially scoffs at the idea of a supernatural being claiming that science can explain any odd features about the deaths and modern detective methods will lead him to the killer. At first it seems that the Horseman may actually be a local hotshot Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien) in costume but Ichabod soon learns that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in his philosophy. As his investigation continues and the headless body count mounts Ichabod finds himself falling in love with Katrina Van Tassel (a blond Christina Ricci) the daughter of his landlord Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon). For about 30 minutes Sleepy Hollow is creepy and effective due largely to Burtons vision cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezkis camera work Danny Elmans score and some impressive production design (by Rick Heinrichs). However there comes a point in every film and Sleepy Hollow is no exception when the story and characters have to take center stage - something that never happens here. Most of Sleepy Hollow consists of Ichabod acting like a second-rate Sherlock Holmes working to uncover the ""shocking"" truth of why the Horseman is on a rampage. Theres also a great deal of pointless running around as Ichabod typically accompanied by a young lad named Masbeth (Marc Pickering) chases after and is chased by the Headless Horseman. These scenes are devoid of suspense or tension and after weve seen the Horseman a few times the sense of ominous menace evaporates leaving nothing in its wake. The screenplay attempts to flesh out Ichabod by giving him a tragic backstory that is divulged through flashbacks. It doesnt really work however - the character remains terminally bland. The Ichabod/Katrina romance is underwritten and underplayed. Theres no chemistry evident between Ricci and Depp so it becomes virtually impossible to accept either passion or tenderness in their interaction. Although Ricci is one of the most talented acting representatives of her generation this does not stand out as one of her better performances. Katrina has a tendency to fade into the background even when shes supposed to be the center of the scene. The only time she holds the spotlight is during her initial appearance when blindfolded she bestows upon Ichabod an unsolicited kiss. Two of the most intriguing aspects of Irvings story are largely discarded in the movie. The first the rivalry between Brom and Ichabod for Katrinas hand is given a brief airing before being definitively dispatched. The second the question of whether the Headless Horseman is a genuine demon or just a man in costume is answered before the opening credits roll. Of course ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" is a ghost story not a murder mystery. With its bloody pile of decapitated corpses Sleepy Hollow resembles nothing more than a beautifully crafted period piece slasher movie. And its about as interesting as one would expect from something with that description. Burton has assembled an impressive supporting cast with the exception of hunky Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers) who is only in about four scenes. In addition to Michael Gambon several other well-known British actors are on hand including Miranda Richardson (as Baltus wife) Michael Gough (Alfred from the Batman movies playing the local notary) and Ian McDiarmid (The Phantom Menaces Darth Sidious). Both Christopher Walken and Christopher Lee have cameos - the former as the Horseman before losing his head and the latter as the New York judge who sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow. For some incomprehensible reason Sleepy Hollow is being released in mid-November instead of four weeks earlier during the pre-Halloween season when it probably would have been guaranteed a healthy week or two at the box office. Set up against James Bond Arnold Schwarzenegger and Buzz Lightyear the Headless Horseman would appear to be overmatched. Things might be different if Sleepy Hollow was a better film but aside from its consistently appealing visual elements and portentous atmosphere Burtons latest is as hollow as a Jack OLantern.

As an embodiment of evil the Horseman a gothic Terminator has style to spare a certain otherworldly frisson. In the end though he doesnt have much personality. After all the dude is quite literally faceless. Set in 1799 ""Sleepy Hollow"" feels like a patchwork of old fantasies rather than a spooky organic imaginative feat of its own. Burton blankets the movie in milky swirls of fog for that cheesy-cool Hammer-horror effect and in just about every shot he gives you something to look at twisted dead trees curling up into the night a witch poised to strike beneath her musty tangle of hair a head freshly sliced off and then skewered like a giant martini olive by the Horsemans sword. Early on Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) a New York City constable who is pioneering the science of crime ""detection"" arrives in the remote upstate village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a mysterious series of decapitations. As he kneels in the road before a corpses grisly neck pulling out his chemicals and donning a pair of contraption eyeglasses with a jutting magnification lens the movie becomes vintage Burton - ghoulish yet whimsical funny in its disjunctive kookiness. Burton achieves the stylized atmosphere of a black-and-white film with his muted waxy colors so that every drop of blood stands out in bold gleaming relief. Too much of the story though hinges on familiar omens. This is a movie that thinks well be creeped out by pentagrams. Before long that fog begins to look rather trite; its store-bought mystery in place of the real thing. Is the Headless Horseman a fake a rigged human scarecrow designed to dispatch people standing in the way of an inheritance? If not what exactly does the monster want? ""Sleepy Hollow"" fails to develop any of this with much intrigue but then the wobbly plot might not have mattered if the films macabre visual lyricism were more startling.

At the same time Washington Irvings classic story about Ichabod Crane and the fearsome Headless Horseman has been radically reconceived for the express purpose of maximizing the mayhem a legitimate if very 90s ploy that puts the picture on a somewhat predictable and repetitive track. As beautifully crafted a film as anyone could ever hope to see Tim Burtons ""Sleepy Hollow"" is an entertainingly eccentric horror tale that envelopes the audience in a dreamy and bloody nightmare. At the same time Washington Irvings classic story about Ichabod Crane and the fearsome Headless Horseman has been radically reconceived for the express purpose of maximizing the mayhem a legitimate if very 90s ploy that puts the picture on a somewhat predictable and repetitive track. Result is a supremely stylish objet dart that has enough flair drama and gory action to emerge as a strong if not sensational holiday B.O. attraction upon its Nov. 19 release. In the opulence and extraordinary realization of a quasi-historical world mostly within studio confines as well as in its bloodthirstiness ""Sleepy Hollow"" forcibly recalls ""Bram Stokers Dracula"" whose director Francis Ford Coppola is one of the exec producers here. Re-creating a small Hudson River community of exactly 200 years ago in the fall of 1799 Burton and his outstanding collaborators have rigorously developed a monochromatic look that is broken only by the intrusion of the color red which happens on numerous choice occasions. Viewers who relish the sort of seamlessly fabricated experience that the greatest cinema artisans can produce will love every minute of this dazzling display of virtuosity while gorehounds will have a tasty treat as well. The credits should perhaps have read ""inspired by"" rather than ""based upon"" the Irving story as script by Andrew Kevin Walker (""Seven"") departs at once from the original by introducing Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) not as a rural teacher but a New York City constable who by the standards of the day is overly concerned with such matters as forensic evidence and proof in criminal investigations. As a sort of punishment for his dedication to ""scientific"" crime-solving techniques Crane is sent on a two-day journey up the river to ""detect"" the murderer in three grisly beheadings in the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow a mostly Dutch community haunted by a violent past. Welcomed into a festive Halloween party at the home of the villages most affluent citizen Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon) the upright Ichabod learns the story of the Hessian Horseman (Christopher Walken) a German mercenary who slew countless settlers with his unerring swordsmanship on behalf of the English during the Revolutionary War before being killed himself. Van Tassel and the rest of the town elders insist that the Hessian back in the form of a ghost is responsible for the murders in which the killer leaves behind the bodies but makes off with the heads. Ichabod a confirmed rationalist firmly rejects this superstitious folderol and further unnerves the religiously inclined locals with his elaborate optical investigative equipment and his disinterment of one of the victims to confirm the rumor that she was pregnant when killed. Ichabods innocence is brought to an abrupt end when in one of the films great set pieces the Headless Horseman thunders into a lovely autumnal hayfield and decapitates the town magistrate (Richard Griffiths) his noggin coming to rest smack between Ichabods legs before the rider impales it and gallops away with it. The nonbelievers world now completely undermined Ichabod retreats to his bed in the Van Tassel household where he is afflicted with increasingly horrific memory nightmares about how his lovely mother (Lisa Marie) was tortured and finally put to death by his righteous preacher father. These events turned him irrevocably against religion and toward pure reason he eventually explains to Van Tassels coolly beautiful daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) who slowly takes an interest in Ichabods investigations. The Horsemans attacks are invariably scary and exciting but after a while it becomes evident that ""Sleepy Hollow"" is structured along the very familiar lines of so many filmed murder sprees before it. How many more innocent victims must die before the crazed killer is stopped? As a Tim Burton movie and a distinctive period piece to boot pic sports many unusual flavors and textures that set it apart but the film is only momentarily ever about anything other than the plot and atmosphere giving it limited stature and resonance. One mini-theme here is optics. Ichabod obviously like Burton himself is adamant about seeing things his own way and there are numerous sequences in which devices of visual perception or presentation figure prominently. His refusal to be blinded by naive beliefs helps him see that the Horseman does not slay randomly but instead selects his victims in ways that ultimately point the finger at one of the villages most prominent figures as the controlling force behind the killers rampages. Pic ends in a nice millennial touch with the ushering in of a new century in New York City. Tousled obstinate and resolute in his rationalism Depp is a far cry from the all-angles boniness of Irvings Ichabod and sometimes recalls his role in Jim Jarmuschs Western ""Dead Man"" as he once again plays a city boy cast into threatening circumstances in the wilds. But the highly adaptable Burton vet is thoroughly engaging as the thoughtful outsider who takes on the literal demon of an insular community; more than once he must overcome his shock and natural physical timidity to rise to the occasion of battling the seemingly indestructible Hessian and Depp conveys these swings with grace and wit. A blonde and ripely ethereal Ricci is a fine match for Depp in their tentative relationship and nicely underplays with an effective gravity. Mostly British players led by the enthusiastic Gambon and Miranda Richardson as his wife who lurks intriguingly in the background fill out the excellent supporting cast. With his sheep-heads wig Jeffrey Jones as the local reverend amusingly looks as much like a cartoon drawing as a man can without heavy makeup while Walken gives the Hessian his evil all. Technically ""Sleepy Hollow"" resides not in a valley but on a mountain top. Burtons films are always visual marvels but the stunning blend of Rick Heinrichs production design Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography Colleen Atwoods costume design the assorted visual effects and the beautifully calibrated alternation between studio and location work (pic was shot in the U.K. with some followup lensing in New York) takes the picture to a truly rarefied level in the visual department. Danny Elfmans score adds turbulent excitement with the occasional touch of bombast.
