Directed by Frank Oz from a screenplay by Paul Rudnick based on the book by Ira Levin. 93 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content thematic material and language. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article Search archive Most e-mailed articles Other links Search event listings First off to answer the question everybody is asking -- no Frank Ozs new version of ""The Stepford Wives"" isnt anywhere near as dreadful as its advance buzz would indicate. Its not especially good either but any movie in which Glenn Close imitates a washing machine and Christopher Walken sports a blond bouffant with dark roots cant possibly be a total waste of time. Those who remember the 1975 version of ""The Stepford Wives"" (based on Ira Levins brief chilling novel about suburban husbands who transformed their wives into perfectly subservient beings) may have to adjust their glasses for this one -- Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick have taken the material on a screeching 180-degree turn substituting camp humor and blinding-bright costumes for suspense and horror. And thats not necessarily such a bad idea; unfortunately Oz and Rudnick cant quite sustain the mood they establish and the movie ultimately has nowhere to go. Essentially the filmmakers have gone back to the book and created an entirely different take on it adding a complicated backstory for their main character Joanna (Nicole Kidman). Where she originally was a relatively contented woman who combined motherhood with a part-time career as a photographer; here shes a scarily heartless television executive in charge of a new lineup of reality shows. (A prologue in which were introduced to these shows is hilarious -- made all the more so by the fact that these shows are only a whisper more extreme than whats on TV right now.) Thanks to a disgruntled contestant things quickly go awry with Joanna losing her job and suffering a nervous breakdown. This is all in the first few minutes of the film and soon a near-catatonic Joannas off to the suburbs with husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) and their two kids planning a new start. But why are all the women of Stepford exquisite ever-smiling and perpetually clad in pastels? And how did their dweeby husbands -- who to a man have dorky haircuts and buck-toothed grins -- land such dishes? These questions are explored with humor rather than menace; its all too silly to be remotely disturbing. (Watch Close as the gleeful Stepford queen bee leading an exercise class of ladies in floral dresses swooping and swirling as ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" plays.) Rudnick best known for ""In amp; Out"" and ""Addams Family Values"" (as well as the sublime Libby Gelman-Waxner column in Premiere magazine) is a master of the one-liner and for a while this ""Stepford Wives"" bumbles along pleasantly its giggles and eye candy going down nicely with popcorn. But by taking out the horror Oz and Rudnick have also lost the bite. The tension in the 1975 version came from the real-life social change taking place at the time as the still-young feminist movement changed the power relationship between the sexes. Now according to this movie its laughable to think that men might be threatened by successful women (alas not true) and so the issue isnt explored at all -- we dont really understand whats going on in Joanna and Walters marriage or what motivates either of them. And the movies final third in which a new and only partially satisfying ending is played out feels like a muddle; you can sense the last-minute reworking that took place. When ""The Stepford Wives"" is funny enough none of this matters -- and sometimes it is particularly when Roger Bart (as a Stepford gay husband) is sashaying about in his color-coordinated separates or Bette Midler totters through her impeccable home as a newly transformed domestic goddess or Kidman poses in a Stepford grocery store in front of a perfectly symmetrical display of pastel-colored egg cartons like the fully clothed centerfold of some suburban-bliss magazine. It could have been great satire but it settles for silliness. Thats better than nothing but you wonder what might have been.

Here Nicole Kidman assumes the Katharine Ross role as Joanna Eberhard a sharp-suited media executive who is unceremoniously fired from her job at a TV channel in New York City and subsequently slips into an extreme depression. Exactly why a move en masse with your family - Joannas hubby Walter is played by Matthew Broderick - to the anodyne sickly-sweet oh-so-perfect Connecticut suburb of Stepford should cure anybodys mental illness is beyond me. The towns manicured lawns pink frilly dresses mock Tudor mansions and horrific inhabitants should be enough to push most sane people over the edge permanently. If this is the American Dream Im quite happy with the nightmare.Of course that is partly the point; this is all intended as a satire on conservative middle-American values. However the crucial problem with this remake is that the central conceit is now well-known. Still to protect newcomers to the story I wont reveal it here; suffice to say the plot machinery of the original is still intact. This time around however Oz and writer Paul Rudnick play it more for laughs and theres nothing more ineffective than mild satire. Furthermore Bette Midlers chaotic Jewish writer and Roger Barts flighty gay man are both as stereotypical as the fully paid-up housewives. Ozs Stepford is simply not sinister enough allowing the film all the critical bite of a camp guard dog.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Now Hollywood is the biz of the buzz. Buzz is the murmur that precedes a films release; it usually starts in a studios publicity department. But good buzz can turn bad when outsiders see the film and start dishing. (The outsiders are almost never critics. Weve been out of the power equation for ages.) Tabloid headlines play a role too. When the stars are Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez and the film is Gigli the anticipatory mood can quickly sour from must-see to buzz-saw. Bad buzz has recently hit the summers big grownup drama Steven Spielbergs The Terminal and the big grownup comedy The Stepford Wives. Stepford endured lots of rewriting reshooting and trimming to a terse 93 min. In other words the film -- a remake of the 1975 thriller about ""perfect"" suburban women who turn out to be robots -- underwent the same radical makeover the same behavioral modification as the wives of Stepford. And with the same goal to make it prettier and more pleasing. As for the Spielberg film in early June the Internet cinephile site Aint It Cool News blared the headline IS THE TERMINAL RESHOOTING ITS ENDING RIGHT NOW? and noted that some industry screenings had been canceled.

The 10 films Hanks starred in before this year each grossed more than 100 million at the North American wickets. He faltered only with this springs The Ladykillers and that one doesnt count. (Making a film with indie icons like the Coen brothers -- or with Charlie Kaufman as Jim Carrey did for the similarly low-grossing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind -- is considered image-polishing pro bono work for a big star like an off-Broadway stint or a benefit concert.) In The Terminal Viktor Navorski (Hanks) arrives at a New York City airport on a flight from his native land Krakozhia. The country has just suffered a coup and until the U.S. recognizes a legitimate regime he cant go into the city or back home. (Its not explained why many others on his flight wouldnt be in the same predicament.) So Viktor is under airport arrest; to find food work a place to sleep and a woman to love he must rely on his own resources. Which are considerable. This is after all a Spielberg movie (Viktor is E.T. the sweet alien who wants to fulfill his mission and go home) and a Hanks film (Viktor is the castaway one man in a strange environment making do with whats available). The surprise about The Terminal is not that it got bad buzz but that its a bad film. Several bad films actually. First its a comedy of desperation with lots of sight gags (a machine that spits quarters in Viktors face too many people slipping on a wet floor) in the style of French comic actor-director Jacques Tati. Then its a love story as Viktor romances a flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Finally the uplifting and heart tugging kick in. The Terminal is Spielbergs shortest feature since the first Jurassic Park yet it drags plods piling one lifeless situation atop another. For all the effort and good intentions the movie is in-terminal-ble. In the case of Buzz v. Stepford yes the movie is a little messy. But thats forgivable since it has a wonderfully wounding malice directed at both the Stepford Conn. contingent of Energizer Bunny wives and the New Yorkers who have just moved in. Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) a just-fired network boss wears black to the towns July 4 picnic. ""Only high-powered castrating Manhattan bitches wear black"" she is told.

One was a generalized uncertainty about the coming of this new thing called feminism. Using a thriller writers seriously twisted moral imagination creepiness-specialist Levin (who wrote ""Rosemarys Baby"") fashioned and Goldman amplified a work about the ultimate male backlash to the movement in which the women were quietly and maliciously replaced by animatronic sex dolls who embodied the Playboy philosophys ultimate female a tart in bed a gourmet in the kitchen a slave in all other situations. And at the same time there was the urban hipsters subtle fear of the suburbs those bland perky primary-colored Columbias and Restons rising on the horizon where everybody seemed to be having such a good time at mandatory volleyball practice every Tuesday. Oooo scary stuff man. It wasnt very good. So why remake it? Beats me but theres even less to the story now than there was. It feels curiously unmoored in time disconnected from anything in todays society. Thats because feminism is here to stay as every man jack of us knows and arguing about it  or lashing back  is pointless. Game set match. So the movie feels like a fossil dead frozen bone so extinct you forget why it existed in the first place. And the city-suburb axis has pretty much vanished from the film which is also too bad because it hasnt vanished from society though in admitting that I know the guys are going to tease the heck out of me at volleyball next Tuesday. Evidently the hope was to jigger the tone to move it from Levin-Goldmans cold icky dread and paranoia to something more broadly comical and satirical. In the history of Hollywood bad decisions this ones up there with the same genius who tried to make Brian Bosworth a star. As it plays out on-screen under black comedy specialist Frank Ozs direction the movie is surprisingly simple. It hasnt a single decent wrinkle. None of it appears to be well thought out or thought through and its consequently never remotely believable. Yet at the same time it lacks the finesse to go the other direction by creating an alternative comic reality. Its neither here nor there; its nowhere. The first two minutes are the best. Were introduced to Nicole Kidman in the role Katharine Ross famously played though Ross was a housewife. Kidmans Joanna is the president of a Fox-like TV network that specializes in sleazy reality shows and we meet her promisingly at an affiliate convention as she introduces new programming. Only in this one instance do the filmmakers seem fully engaged as they hammer out fantasy exaggerations of reality shows including a work of genius called ""I Can Do Better"" in which dreary couples are treated to a week of sex with beautiful people then asked whether they want to stay with their spouses. Anyhow thats the Joanna Id like to know better and a movie following her crass adventures in yet-crazier reality TV-land might be hysterical. It might also be timely. But no. Implausibly shes fired has a breakdown and goes with hubby Walter (unthreatening unremarkable Matthew Broderick) to the luxurious gated Connecticut community of Stepford where all the wives are above average if your idea of average is a Playboy Playmate in June of 1975. Theres almost no mystery no suspense no narrative drive. The movie yields its secrets without the slightest attempt at a tease; it just marches straightforwardly from plot point to plot point revealing without wit or humor that Christopher Walken is the genius behind the computerization of the wives (all of whom are statuesque but without meaningful personality) while his wifey Glenn Close is doing her best delusional Norma Desmond impersonation. To some degree the movie loves its own hypocrisy. It clearly disapproves of implanting microchips in womens brains to turn them docile  that would be bad bad bad  yet it gooses what little comic energy it has out of two such transformations. Both Bette Midlers pushy Bobbi Markowitz and Roger Barts snippy gay Roger Bannister get theirs and the movie luxuriates in their reduction to cheery irony-free sarcasm-innocent amoebas. It even enjoys the reduction of Kidman to a walking Barbie doll at one point while pretending to be horrified. You keep waiting for the movie to turn into something to surprise with a joke or a production design (its quite ugly) or a line or a spurt of energy. But it stays the same throughout; it seems to have been directed by a man with a computer chip for banality implanted in his brain.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 10 2004 649 PM My So-Called Wife The campy delights of The Stepford Wives. By David Edelstein This years model Its fitting that the remake of TheStepford Wives (Paramount) opens on the national day of mourning for Ronald Reagan the political leader who made such hay out of fondly invoking the 1950s--before he once said we knew we had a race problem and all those other messy social ills. The Ira Levin novel and the subsequent 1975 movie were meant to satirize a patriarchy that would do anything to bring back the days before wives began to work talk back or in 70s parlance self-actualize. Im not sure if that 50s never-never land existed (it was at least partly a construct of the government and entertainment industries). But the longing for it was real and powerful enough that feminists could take Levins outlandish melodrama as a cautionary tale. Ive always been suspicious of Levin Theres a sadistic sexual component in his tales of female victimization that cancels out the feminist thrust and then some. But he was able to get under peoples skin; and the original film pedestrian as it was became a touchstone. Suddenly you heard ""Oh shes such a Stepford Wife ..."" Shamed the so-called domestic goddess had to evolve finally embracing as a role model the likes of Martha Stewart a homemaker who could also be a corporate titan. Advertisement The remake is ... how can I put this? A desecration? A travesty? Certainly its a slapdash sendup. The writer Paul Rudnick appears to have concluded that since 1974 weve had so many 50s parodies horror movies and even serious deconstructions like Todd Haynes Far From Heaven (2002) that only a raving lunatic could long for the way we supposedly were. This Stepford Wives directed by Frank Oz is not just making fun of 50s nostalgia; its making fun of making fun of 50s nostalgia. It says you cant even take those fantasies seriously enough to critique anymore. Word of the movies terribleness began to filter out months ago and different endings were reportedly shot and tested. The one thats there now is from hunger Its a miracle that the actors dont turn to the camera and roll their eyes or make little shadow bunnies. Paramount Pictures has not widely screened it for critics It took considerable ingenuity for me even to get into a preview. And I imagine that audiences who show up this weekend expecting a genuine thriller with horror overtones will want to throw things at the screen or maybe tar and feather the projectionist. All of that being the case I had a fabulous time. Well I did once I accepted that it was a campfest--a great Provincetown drag show of The Stepford Wives. Nicole Kidman plays the heroine Joanna Eberhart a celebrated womens TV network president who makes reality shows in which men are gleefully emasculated. When one participant--played by actor/screenwriter Mike White--flips out and shoots at her at an affiliates conference this destroyer of the nuclear family gets the boot. After her nervous breakdown Joannas husband Walter (Matthew Broderick with a hunched posture that virtually eliminates his neck) buys a house in Stepford Conn. Walter has been a vice-president under his powerhouse spouse and seems to relish the opportunity finally to take charge--to be the man of the family. Advertisement You know what Joanna finds a 50s Disneyland of suburban affluence in which dumpy men are married to women who dress and act like 50s garden-party ladies or flight attendants. Theres also--and this is a subversive twist--a gay couple Yes the men of Stepford have no problem sympathizing with the gay ""husbands"" inability to control his queeny ""wife."" The non-robotic people--Kidmans Joanna Bette Midler as the defiantly slobby Jewish author Bobbi Markowitz and Roger Bart as Roger Bannister a screamingly gay architect--form a club and dish about a Stepford wife (played by singer Faith Hill) who appeared to be short-circuiting at a square dance. These scenes are a scream--and I dont even like camp which long ago lost its gay bite and merged with pothead 80s irony. It helps that the actors have such headlong energy. Kidman looks great with a dark bob and she has evolved into a fearless comedian Watch her receive the news of her firing and maintain her demented smiling poise while accelerating past a gantlet of well-wishers on the verge of spontaneous combustion. Midler is delicious; Bart (a Broadway stalwart new to movies) has killer one-liners and zings them into the stratosphere; Glenn Close stops the show as the towns electrifyingly chirpy den mother; and as her icily affable husband Christopher Walken is in a Method-zombie league of his own. Rudnick is a funny writer--one of the funniest there is--but it must be said that hes too comfy in his camp little universe His targets are obvious and real emotion seems beyond his reach at least in this mode. There are creepy moments all through The StepfordWives but apart from the scene in which Roger Bannister recognizes his terrible destiny nothing eats into your mind. And dont expect logic--dramatic melodramatic romantic or science-fictional--in the desperate finale. In retrospect almost nothing in the movie makes sense. In truth even its central conceit is dated and unconvincing These smiling dolls with long legs and (inflatable) breasts who keep perfect houses and cook perfect meals and scream with pleasure in the sack What man would want that???

(AP Photo/Andrew Schwartz) Photo ANDREW SCHWARTZ What if a new film looked just like a familiar one but something seemed dreadfully amiss? Say hello to The Stepford Wives. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Stepford Wives Satire. Starring Nicole Kidman Matthew Broderick and Christopher Walken. Directed by Frank Oz. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are movies that have things seriously off about them that are conceptually self-defeating that entangle the filmmakers like flies in a spiders web and that are simply unfixable and shouldnt have been made. ""The Stepford Wives"" the remake of the 1975 cult classic is a movie in that category but of its kind its not that bad. Before it degenerates into a complete mess its an entertaining mess and something about its willingness to please maintains the audiences goodwill throughout. It stars Nicole Kidman in the role originally played by Katharine Ross as a woman who moves with her husband to the upscale community of Stepford Conn. and notices something odd about the women. They act like well Stepford wives Theyre placid have glazed demeanors perfect homes and gentle expressions and they wait on their husbands hand and foot. Obviously something is wrong here. In the years since Ira Levins novel was adapted to the screen ""The Stepford Wives"" -- not the movie but the concept -- has become a part of American culture a reference point in a million jokes. To redo the film as a period piece would have been too campy. Yet moving the film to modern times proves dicey as well. This time Joanna (Kidman) is a high-powered TV executive who has just been fired. In the firing scene director Frank Oz keeps the camera right on Kidman as she registers the unthinkable. Its beautiful comic acting and reminds audiences that Kidman despite her porcelain beauty is a first-rate farceur. But as the film goes on it becomes clear that Kidman is not right for the role. Just to play a normal-looking woman Kidman has to be coiffed in a severe dark wig. To make her look anything less than stunning she practically needs to be wearing a costume. Knowing what Kidman really looks like and knowing the Stepford beauty aesthetic we cant help thinking that becoming a Stepford wife might be a reasonable course for Joanna or at least her natural destiny. Where the movie really wanted to go -- into uproarious comedy -- would have been better supported by Bette Midler in the Kidman part. As it stands she plays Joannas friend Bobbie the author of self-help books including one about her mother ""I Love You but Please Die"" But shes underutilized. Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick establish a broad comic tone in the opening scenes but it comes back to bite them setting a level they cant maintain and leaving them with no room to shift into a more serious or eerie mode as the story demands. Satire is difficult but at least a satire has the advantage of being grounded in truth. This new ""Wives"" is essentially a satire of a satire; thus its cut off from any observed reality or anything like a point of view. It can only be sustained by one-liners. That the film stays afloat as long as it does is thanks to some hard paddling by the actors who seem to have been directed to push the material and by Rudnick who comes up with witty lines and comic juxtapositions such as a gay Stepford husband (Roger Bart). But he cant make us laugh hard enough not to notice that the transplant is being rejected namely that of a 30-year- old satire into a 2004 world. If in 1975 the dark satire of ""The Stepford Wives"" had teeth its because its message rang true Many men would have been ecstatic to be married to a sexually willing robot. But in 2004 there are just not enough men like this to make the movie work even as an exaggeration. Can anyone look at the intelligent open face of Matthew Broderick who plays Kidmans husband and believe even for a second that hed prefer a placid zombie to a complicated woman? Could anyone believe hed even consider it? Its not possible. Weve moved on. All Rudnick can do is make fun of the material but that means pulling back and making it safe. It means abandoning all traces of mystery and menace. It means that Christopher Walken who might have been genuinely creepy as the leader of the towns men is stuck with a character whose edges are softened. And Glenn Close as his wife and partner in crime is just a fluttery eccentric. By the middle the movie has exhausted its effectiveness as an in- joke and begins to seem like a pointless exercise. This sense is enhanced when we realize that the movie has even altered the very nature of the wives themselves further tilting things in a less sinister direction. By the last half hour theres nothing to be done but no one gives up. The cast gamely keeps delivering the one-liners though the movie is in a death spiral. -- Advisory This film contains lewd humor.

The screenwriter novelist and playwright (who is also the funnyman behind the curtain of fictional columnist Libby Gelman-Waxner) turns them out by the bag as he showed in both ""Addams Family"" movies and ""In amp; Out."" <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=howenode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=howe;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1086964443206?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=howenode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=howe;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1086964443206?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=howenode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=howe;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1086964443207?""></a> Gags were the bread and butter of those movies. But in ""The Stepford Wives"" an adaptation of novelist Ira Levins cautionary tale and the 1975 film of the same name the Rudnick formula is stale business indeed. Rudnick and director Frank Oz (who wouldnt know a serious comedy if it fractured his funny bone) take to the satirical task too gleefully. The result an empty comedy that takes hackneyed potshots at consumerism. Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) is a cutthroat host of a fabulously successful reality TV show and the youngest president of the EBS television network. When a disgruntled TV show participant goes into a psychotic shooting rage Joannas show collapses and she finds herself suffering a nervous breakdown. Her mild-mannered husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) decides its time to make a fresh start. So he drives her and the two kids to Stepford Conn. an idyllic corner of suburban affluence where the houses are ridiculously large and the people are pleasant but strange. This is the land of Betty Crocker gone insane where too many beautiful wives (and dementedly zealous homemakers) defer like slaves to their husbands. These women make hot muffins take care of the kids obsess about cleaning house and are always ready to make their husbands feel like stud-kings. Joanna who makes friends with New York transplants Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Midler) and architect Roger Bannister (Roger Bart) is disturbed by what she sees. But Walter doesnt think things are so bad. The best performance comes from Glenn Close as Stepfords de facto host a bizarrely upbeat being who welcomes the new couple into this artificial paradise. But shes a one-note creation. Kidman certainly has the jaded frostiness needed for a power executive who turns slowly warmer. But here shes betrayed by a skin-deep script that never permits her to get going. Shes a pawn in the comic action. Theres no room for maneuvering. She was given that kind of space in ""To Die For"" as the dry-ice murderous TV personality Suzanne Stone. And she used it. Speaking of the movies thinness how do you ""make fun"" of reality TV McMansions SUVs and materialistic malaise when theyre so endemic and so obvious? Its like teasing televangelists used-car salesmen and lawyers too easy on-the-nose and free of surprise. ""The Stepford Wives"" provides funny but mutely safe giggles about former frat boys and nerds who have turned their wives into robots. The theme sags with banality from the get-go and its only Rudnicks humor that helps you get through any of it. Oh lets ruin one Rudnick joke for you. Its worth paying tribute to his humor. During that reality TV show which is called ""I Can Do Better"" married couples are sent to an island where both spouses are separated and feted by attractive sexual partners. The finale occurs when the spouses reunite and decide if they want to stay married or move on. The husband Hank who says he has only ever slept with his wife is sure he wants to stay married. But the wife who clearly has cavorted with the hunks she was alone with points out that in her old life ""I only slept with one man and that was usually Hank."" Wicked wicked. And yet not quite wicked enough to break the movie out of its teeny-tiny cul-de-sac. THE STEPFORD WIVES (PG-13 93 minutes) -- Contains sexual content and some obscenity. Area theaters.

Yet it seems director Frank Oz and writer Paul Rudnick semi-replicating the wacky tone of their 1997 comedy In amp; Out pulled some muscles dragging the stale tale into fresh territory. (Related clip Watch a scene from The Stepford Wives) Kidmans famous strawberry blond hair does a disappearing act in the early scenes of Stepford Wives. Paramount Pictures Perfectly lacquered women devote their lives to their husbands in suburban Connecticut -- and the fact that theyre robots tends to cut down on their complaints. Its a concept already so heavily mined by Ira Levins novel a fairly well-remembered 1975 movie and three TV sequels that the term ""Stepford wives"" has entered the vernacular. Its been done with a serious vibe so often that the filmmakers are probably right to think a send-up is the only hope. Nicole Kidman is comically assured in a rare farcical turn. She plays a reality-TV producer whose brainstorm backfires and gets her canned. So shes off to the burbs (with spouse Matthew Broderick and kids) for picnics and a ladies book club that does not want to discuss Vol. 3 of Robert Caros LBJ bio. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Stepford Wives   1/2 (out of four) Stars Nicole Kidman Matthew Broderick Glenn Close Bette Midler Christopher Walken Director Frank Oz Distributor Paramount Rating PG-13 for sexual content thematic material and language Opens Friday nationwide You feel some of the strain in this immaculately shot designed and costumed farce but its fast and the cast is lively even though a lost-looking Broderick rarely gets to shoot his patented bewildered look. Kidman is again surprisingly chameleonic in appearance. Even discounting the huge makeup assist in The Hours she has looked strikingly different in Birthday Girl Moulin Rouge Cold Mountain-- and now this. Fairly underutilized is Christopher Walken as the guru behind the robot scheme though Walken belongs in a Stepford send-up as much as John Wayne does in Sands of Iwo Jima.. Bette Midler gets to play dual roles (irreverent ""before"" and perfect homemaker ""after"") and Glenn Close -- calling on her Sunset Boulevard histrionics -- is best of all. As a summer movie Wives is worth 500 Van Helsings but theres something pretty robotic about doing it again. Yet the story will always be a natural because women can use it as a model of what they dont want to be while men can display their feminist side by agreeing. That is when theyre not fantasizing just for a second about yelling into the kitchen ""Ill take another beer after the fifth inning.""

"The Stepford Wives | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review The Stepford Wives Brian Lowry Chief TV Critic blowryontv 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr June 10 2004 | 1200AM PT Not the ""troubled"" disaster that media reports have suggested it might be yet nor do its oddly matched parts ever congeal into a fully formed creation. Whatever curiosity the title and cast muster odds are this Paramount/DreamWorks collaboration wont endure long as the summers other mechanized monsters roll off the assembly line. Another ""remake"" that merits the title in name only ""The Stepford Wives"" isnt the ""troubled"" disaster that media reports have suggested it might be yet nor do its oddly matched parts ever congeal into a fully formed creation. Audiences that find themselves laughing at first will likely be fidgeting as the pic drifts toward a peculiar if oddly predictable climax requiring -- much like the Stepford women -- that brains be checked at the door. Whatever curiosity the title and cast muster odds are this Paramount/DreamWorks collaboration wont endure long as the summers other mechanized monsters roll off the assembly line. Bearing about as much resemblance to its 30-year-old cinematic source and Ira Levins book as the Dan Aykroyd comedy ""Dragnet"" did to Jack Webbs small-screen show the new and not-improved ""Stepford Wives"" trades in eerie suspense for dark (and sometimes broad) comedy. And where the original film bathed in paranoia about shifting feminist norms the 21st century mandates its own spin with a tightly wound career woman -- whose corporate flame has shone much brighter than her husbands -- being whisked away to a world of vacant stares and baking cupcakes. That would be Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) a network president seemingly modeled after the Faye Dunaway character in another mid-70s fable ""Network."" Riding high in the ratings Joannas latest over-the-top reality show concept (which is pretty funny as ""Saturday Night Live""-type shtick goes) abruptly ends her tenure at mythical EBS prompting her to rethink priorities. In a flash Joanna husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) and their two kids are zooming down to Connecticut and the idyllic town of Stepford where the nerdy-looking guys all have impossibly beautiful and attentive wives. So impossible in fact that theres no real build-up or at least shouldnt be to the protagonists sense that something weird and wicked is happening here. Granted the decades have made the men of Stepford more broad-minded even allowing a gay couple into the circle. So Joanna takes refuge from this sanitized world with a slovenly writer (Bette Midler) and snarky architect (Roger Bart) -- both wildly successful in their own right but equally at odds with their significant others. Writer Paul Rudnick who previously worked with director Frank Oz on ""In amp; Out"" dishes up enough amusing dialogue and pop-culture references to keep the movie watchable and entertaining through the first third or so. Walter notes that Joannas black-on-black wardrobe -- in contrast to the women of Stepfords sunny palette -- screams ""castrating Manhattan career bitches"" and when she doesnt flinch at troll-like men possessing trophy spouses Joanna explains ""I work in television."" Still the creepy idea of men replacing their wives (and husband) is played for laughs somewhat awkwardly and the underlying premise -- an ongoing battle of the sexes where the men have essentially lost -- is so much of a stretch that the film offers more satirical gumming than bite. Oz has always possessed a keen visual eye and thats again the case here though whatever subtlety the first film possessed has been jettisoned from the clever opening credits -- depicting idealized feminine images of the past -- going forward. (As an aside the credited producers include Edgar J. Scherick who died in 2002 having produced the original as well as the 1980 TV movie ""Revenge of the Stepford Wives."") Although she makes for a smashing poster girl Kidman cant do much with her starched role and Broderick comes across as a more polished (but less funny) version of the frustrated family man he portrayed so effectively in ""Election."" The fact the movie holds together at all in fact relies on the talented supporting players from the sheer kick of Christopher Walkens off-kilter presence to Glenn Closes painfully forced Cheshire Cat grin to Bart and Midlers winningly bitchy asides. Perhaps appropriately the physical trappings are impeccable from the lifesize Barbie costumes to the town itself which could be a Disney-planned community. Even the much-discussed re-shoots whatever they were have been stitched in so as not to show. Indeed whatever convulsions and creative makeover the film underwent are most evident only upon reading the production notes which label the movie ""a subversive and comic look at rampant consumerism and the quest for perfection."" While that provocative-sounding theme might be fodder for newspaper op-ed writers its certainly not indicative of the frothy antics depicted onscreen. And if it truly describes what this ""Stepford Wives"" was meant to represent at some point in its development then like the movies conceit about using technology to improve flawed models it will have to wait for the DVD.

Some three decades ago the notion of a brotherhood of threatened suburban husbands colluding to stifle the squawks of wives drawn to a dangerous liberating womens movement by turning unruly spouses into docile robots was a ballsy commentary on the war between the sexes. In his 1972 bubbling fondue of a novel Ira Levin located unkempt male fear and female anger within the trimmed-hedge borders of a sci-fi-perfect planned community blessed with modern appliances and old-fashioned notions of loving honoring and obeying - and the movie that followed kept the sharp edges of Levins satire intact. The title itself became a pop-cultural password understood everywhere shorthand for what no woman ever again wanted to be and what no man could ever again admit to desiring. Now girlfriend you can kiss that feminist-theory stuff goodbye. Now armored babes successful as all get-out dress voluntarily like Stepford dolls in 50s-femme sheaths and Mamie Eisenhower handbags. Now husbands write man-mag essays about how their career-frazzled wives wont come to bed. Now women are Supreme Court justices and men are from Mars. And now were handed a remake of ""The Stepford Wives""? Well yes but in the only style considered safe apparently by moviemakers who want to pacify most of the people most of the time These updated wives and the dramas theyre caught up in have gone gay. ""Sex and the City"" gay. Jack and Karen on ""Will amp; Grace"" pixie-ish. Heterosexuals are by implication the new robots in the Stepford envisioned by director Frank Oz and screenwriter Paul Rudnick. And the sooner one can adapt to a ""Queer Eye"" view of Nicole Kidman as robot-resistant Joanna Eberhart or Bette Midler (hellooo) as Joannas farklempt unmuzzled neighbor Bobbie Markowitz or Glenn Close in the drag queen role of Stepford doyenne Claire Wellington the sooner one can find ones way around the neighborhood. Actually its not so much a neighborhood as a collection of comedy checkpoints. In the beginning theres Kidman exuberantly strident as a roaring TV executive heir to the mania of Faye Dunaway in ""Network."" Joanna the network cheerleader delights in her hateful reality-TV shows (including I Can Do Better in which spouses ditch one another for hotter sex partners) - until shes axed. Then theres Joanna the basket case removed by her husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) to the restorative tranquility of Connecticut where she emerges from her nervous breakdown to discover friends among the pastel neighbors in Bobbie and a giddily loud-and-proud new ally Roger (""The Producers"" Roger Bart). Joannas dawning realization that the women of Stepford arent quite human is supposed to disturb her as is Walters realization that he rather admires the pneumatic airbrushed wives of his new buddies in the Stepford Mens Association but the anxiety is played with quotation marks around it. Christopher Walkens guest-weirdo turn as charismatic head of the club is supposed to be spooky and maybe even scary but the performance pure Walkenese is its own Krazy Glued novelty act. The bright Rudnickian jokes plink like ice cubes in a Sea Breeze on a Fire Island beach When Roger in his own version of Stepfordization is turned from a bitchy raconteur with frosted hair and a lavender sweater thrown around his shoulders to a boxy gay Republican his former hot-for-hunks life is summed up in a discarded little T-shirt with a picture of Viggo Mortensen on it and a photo of Orlando Bloom. When Joanna sits in on a ladies book club she stuns her peers into bovine stupor by proclaiming her avid interest in Robert A. Caros biography of Lyndon Johnson. (Theyre excited by a coffee-table book on Christmas decorations.) These are funny bits - the movie is landscaped with them like so much expensive shrubbery. But at no time is Joanna or indeed the rest of the already zombie-fied wives ever really in danger. At no time do the men - that is the straight ones - believably hold the upper hand. In the new town of Stepford theres no bitterness no struggle no competition none of the scars of the sexual revolution. Theres just gay apparel.
