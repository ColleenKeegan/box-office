R Violence torture sexuality language. In Korean with subtitles. 3.5 STARS ""Oldboy"" is a South Korean revenge flick that transcends the genre. Both brutal and lyrical writer-director Park Chan-wooks existential nail-biter has torture scenes that will have you avoiding dentists sushi bars and badly appointed hotel rooms. Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) is a drunk a buffoon but he toughens up after 15 years locked - for no apparent reason - in a mock hotel room. When he finally gets out - again for no reason - he grabs at life with a gusto that involves a live octopus a scene that is bound to cling with all tentacles to the pop-culture consciousness. He also embarks on a mission to find his captor and to punish punish punish. This hunt for revenge is really a quest for self-discovery. The story acting and brilliant directing elevate ""Oldboy"" into a human struggle to know yourself and your place in the universe and to live with that sometimes terrible knowledge. Jami Bernard LIPSTICK amp; DYNAMITE At Angelika (123). Not rated Adult themes. 3 STARS ""Dynamite"" perfectly describes this riveting documentary from Ruth Leitman in which she revisits the still-gorgeous ladies of wrestling past. Leitman has done a fantastic job drawing out their individual stories. Each of her spirited subjects has a fascinating tale to tell but nearly all involve hardscrabble upbringings built on physical abuse poverty and extreme exploitation. At one point gravel-voiced Ella Waldek describes her nemesis Madame Moolah as ""a rough tough broad."" Its hard to find a better compliment for any of these survivors. Elizabeth Weitzman NINAS TRAGEDIES At the Quad Lincoln Plaza and Clearview 1st and 62nd (150). Not rated Nudity sexual and adult themes. In Hebrew with subtitles. 3 STARS Israeli director Savi Gabizon has created a nuanced coming-of-age portrait that ought to strike a chord with audiences everywhere. Though the movies plot hinges on the aftermath of a terrorist attack his protagonist Nadav could be any 14-year-old. Bored with school and overwhelmed by his parents problems he puts most of his energy into an all-consuming crush - on his very pregnant aunt. The rest of the cast finds grace and humor in an environment forever suffused with the potential for heartache. E.W. NAKED FAME At the Quad (124). Not rated Nudity sexuality language. 1.5 STARS. Who exactly are you insulting if you point out the similarities between the music industry and the porn business? Christopher Long uncovers some demoralizing parallels while documenting the singing career of erstwhile adult film star Colton Ford. Too bad his subjects personality is located mostly in his pecs. That Ford wont make it in the music biz is quickly clear so the movie also traces his relationship with his partner (and frequent co-star) Blake Harper. Unfortunately this pair has little to offer once clothed. Its interesting in the same way the early rejection episodes of ""American Idol"" are oddly compelling. But of course you can watch those for free. E.W. MONDOVINO At Film Forum (215). PG-13 Pinup nudity. In several languages with subtitles. 2.5 STARS. Throughout writer-director-oenophile Jonathan Nossiters overlong globe-hopping documentary about the wine industry I kept thinking what a wonderful boondoggle hed conceived for himself. Travel the world visit its greatest wineries sip its best wines. We dont see Nossiter sipping many of these wines though its clear hes having his opportunities. Mostly hes conducting interviews with people who are either painting dire pictures about the homogenization of fine wines or those thought to be responsible - like the Mondavi family that is buying up vineyards around the world. If you have a serious interest in wine and the patience for this kind of rangy undisciplined filmmaking youll learn something. But youll have more fun at a winetasting.Jack Mathews Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Alone together on a windswept island off the Atlantic Coast in the mid-1980s a father and his teenage daughter are living an intense -- and for us unsettling -- life in a picturesque setting of ecological correctness. (Jack is played by Daniel Day-Lewis Rose by Camilla Belle.) As the story begins their Oedipally tinged idyll is about to end with dramatic consequences. Yet those consequences prove as wearing as theyre harrowing. The writer-director Rebecca Miller has diluted an extraordinary richness of texture and emotional complexity with a too-muchness of schematic sometimes didactic drama. The two central performances are superb but a third role is significant too -- a poignantly funny young man Rodney who wants to be a hairdresser; hes played by Ryan McDonald. Rodney provides welcome relief from the relentless intensity -- not comic relief just the presence of an eccentric kid whos full of small surprises. Rebecca Millers previous film the very fine ""Personal Velocity"" moved with the speed suggested by its title three vivid stories of three vivid women. This time shes shooting for something different (though with the same shooter Ellen Kuras whose cinematography manages to be exciting and self-effacing at the same time.) ""The Ballad of Jack amp; Rose"" folds at least three themes into the same story the history of a utopian commune that Jack founded on the island in the late 1960s; his efforts to sustain the ideals of the commune which failed a few years later by battling a developer (Beau Bridges) whos putting up a suburban-style development on land that Jack reveres; and the relationship between this powerful father seriously ill with a heart condition and the daughter who loves him passionately and who has been suffocated and isolated by his love. That the last theme is dominant may come as no surprise since Ms. Miller and her husband Daniel Day-Lewis are both children of legendarily powerful fathers Arthur Miller and C. Day-Lewis. (The actor also starred in the film version of Arthur Millers ""The Crucible."") This is not to say the father on screen has been idealized. To the contrary hes a fallen visionary whos been driven half-crazy by his various failures and by extension the failure of 1960s idealism. Whatever he may have been the man we see now is a zealot -- an eco-terrorist really. He is also a terrible fool. On an impulse Jack brings his lover Kathleen (Catherine Keener) and her two sons to live on the island ""an experiment"" he calls it ""a new chapter."" When Rose responds to Kathleens presence with lethal jealousy Jack ends the experiment ruthlessly. Watching father and daughter can be fascinating. Daniel Day-Lewis is of course one of the finest actors of our time; he makes Jack an explosive device of mixed motives and incestuous longings. As her father sickens and declines Camilla Belles Rose blossoms. If the film is dominated by the father Rebecca Millers ultimate concern is the daughter a beautiful child struggling to break away and become her own woman. A surprisingly clumsy coda shows the outcome of her struggle but plenty of clumsiness precedes it in the dramatic -- and programmatic and melodramatic -- end game of Jacks life. (Theres even a snake in the despoiled Eden.) ""The Ballad of Jack amp; Rose"" has density enough for several films. Whats missing is spontaneity and variety. And throughout most of the narrative velocity. Guess Who Bernie Mac is a formidable comic but you can tell that his timing is off from his first moments on screen in ""Guess Who."" And not just his timing. He looks miserable more often than not as the bombastic pater familias in this frenzied switch on ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner?"" -- young black woman (nice work by Zoe Saldana) brings white husband-to-be (Ashton Kutcher) home to meet her parents. Its disingenuous to draw a direct comparison between ""Guess Who"" and its predecessor. When Stanley Kramers dramatic comedy opened in 1967 with a cast that included Sidney Poitier Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn it played to an audience of adults who were surprised and intrigued by the subject matter -- interracial marriage wasnt something people joked about four decades ago at least not until Mr. Poitiers impossibly handsome charming and cultivated physician made laughter permissible. The target audience of ""Guess Who"" is young a volunteer army of undiscriminating kids who go to comedies for laughs not for social commentary let alone nuance. (Not that Kramers clever manipulative film was all that nuanced.) So ""Guess Who"" is impurely and simply a comic premise borrowed turned around and dumbed down to the level of sketch or sub-sketch humor. (To fill time the filmmakers fall back on sappy slapstick even sending Messrs. Mac and Kutcher off to race Go-Karts.) Having said this and acknowledging that the new version is probably a shrewd commercial calculation I must also say that its empty-headedness is appalling. Never mind that caricatures have replaced characters; the pivotal caricature makes no sense. Ashton Kutchers Simon is supposed to be boyishly charming and he does have a few pleasant scenes. For the most part though hes pitifully charmless an insipid suitor who literally jumps up and down when hes frustrated. Its good to know that white boys can jump but this ones a colorless loser. Oldboy Shakespearean in its violence ""Oldboy"" also calls up nightmare images of spiritual and physical isolation that are worthy of Samuel Beckett or Dostoyevsky. Does that suggest a thoroughly off-putting pretentiousness? I hope not because Park Chan-wooks dark shocking drama in Korean with English subtitles is astonishing as well as punishing to behold. A surreal thriller combined with a convoluted tale of revenge its the story of a Seoul businessman Oh Dae-su who wakes up after a drunken night around town in a prison that could pass for a tawdry motel. Why is he there? What has he done? Dae-su collects clues from watching TV but 15 years pass before he makes his way out and begins to discover the identity of the enemy who put him there. (He gets his first lead when a homeless man hands him a cellphone and a wallet full of cash.) ""Oldboy"" is a showcase for exceptional acting Choi Min-sik as Dae-su Lee Woo-jin as his old high-school classmate (thus the title) Gang Hye-jung as a sushi waitress who befriends him. The real star though is the filmmaker Park Chan-wook. His film is not for the weak of stomach or heart but its a stunner all the same. Miss Congeniality 2 Armed and Fabulous Sandra Bullock used to be an acquired taste but she may have become unacquirable. The crudeness of the stuff she struts in ""Miss Congeniality 2 Armed and Fabulous"" must be seen to be believed though Im not suggesting you actually see it. In the first ""Miss Congeniality"" her wistful bumbler of an FBI agent Gracie Hart went undercover as a beauty-pageant contestant and was chosen runner-up. The sequel is mostly about Gracies newfound celebrity. Now shes a beautiful bumbler too famous to do ordinary agenting. Other reviews may detail the events that culminate in the heroines near-demise trapped by her own feather boa semi-Isadora Duncan-style in the flooded hull of a fake pirate ship in the lagoon of a Las Vegas hotel. Ill confine this reviewlet to observing that her FBI partner in the strenuous idiocy is an on-again-off-again psychopath played by Regina King and that the film ends on an admirable note of biracial sisterhood and hopes for world peace.    DVD TIP One of Daniel Day-Lewiss most remarkable -- and least often-remarked -- performances was as the frontier scout Hawkeye in Michael Manns spectacular screen version of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992).

When we first meet businessman Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-Sik) hes a drunken boor though hed doubtless sober up if he knew what was coming. Abducted by persons unknown hes held prisoner for 15 years until hes just as unexpectedly released. Still none the wiser he falls into a relationship with a sushi-bar hostess whereupon his captor contacts him by mobile and offers a deal if he can work out why he was kidnapped in the first place the villain will offer up his life - if not the girl cops it. For Oh Dae-Su getting mad and getting even amount to virtually the same thing. The sequence where he rearranges some low-lifes dental work will doubtless attract over-excited attention much like the jaw-dropping one-take hammer-wielding skirmish in a corridor. But the upfront mayhem shouldnt be allowed to distract from the films emotional depth or indeed its brilliant lead performance. For the protagonist vengeance is a voyage of discovery yet his newfound propensity towards violence troubles him and his burning desire to confront his secretive nemesis may be fuelled by lingering self-doubt that he deserved his fate. Whatever happens hell never be the same man again. Choi Min-Sik is in the Pacino or De Niro class running the gamut from terrifying rage to abject degradation. The implausibilities in the plot melt away because were living the experience with him thanks also in part to the bravura expressiveness of Parks direction. Hitchcock and Fincher are reference points but this combines visceral punch a tortured humanity and even an underlying Korean political resonance given the weight of the past. Quite an achievement then and well worthy of its Cannes prize.

(Oldboy is the second film in that trilogy). I actually sort of liked Lady Vengeance and this made me re-think about Oldboy. I must admit that ndeb somehow made a point about the violence in this film. Although Im still definitely not a fan of Oldboy I must admit that the violence and gore are here for a reason and although they might seem distasteful they are not exploitative and gratuitous they are inherent to the story and the theme treated. So my present opinion is that Oldboy is not garbage like I said the first time its a disturbing film that is not for everyone but it is far far superior I humbly admit it to what I call real garbage that is to say when violence and degeneration are treated with complacency and even glorified as for instance in the absolute piece of shit that Alpha Dog is.

No. So taking the film the way it is - the extraordinary elements are the way the viewer is plunged directly into the middle of an inexplicable situation the calibre of the acting the remarkable build in the story the emotional force and the spectacular visual sense.

One day after a rough night youre kidnapped. Ransom? Nah. Nobody who knows you has enough to pay any ransom or even if they did cares enough. So you sit for 15 years in a private jail disguised as a cheap hotel room. You never see another face or hear a voice. The television becomes your life. When you get out your wife has been murdered and you are wanted for it and your daughter has disappeared. Min-sik Choi tries to fend off a murderous bodyguard in the seriously violent ""Oldboy."" (Tartan Films) _____More in Movies_____  Oldboy National Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Brother is that your problem? I imagine youd be plenty ticked off. And so is Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) in Chan-wook Parks ""Oldboy"" a powerful and disturbing psychological drama from South Korea (and the Cannes Film Festival where it won the Grand Prize). The movie isnt pretty. Its basically a straight-on examination of this situation without much in the way of overwrought style. Its primary virtue is its intensity as it stays close on Oh all the way through as he struggles to find out what happened to him why it happened and whos responsible. Though shot of course in Seoul it has a kind of grunge New York look a palette consisting of the crummy green and damp gray of winter in a big unfriendly town. And Oh isnt really heroic; hes certainly no Count of Monte Cristo a fencer with extraordinary charm and looks but pretty much a schmo who rages and cries and despairs over his long unjust incarceration until he finally starts working out and trains himself to become a human weapon of vengeance. But again the idealized is ignored by director Park. When Oh finally discovers the prison where he spent all those years and takes his revenge its no martial arts fantasy but a portrait of a crazed man in the fight of his life armed with the least elegant of all devices a hammer. So the violence is squalid and youre not seeing flying spin kicks and dragon fist punches with elaborate soundtracks of mayhem behind them; it looks like a pig pile in a sewer not a ballet. And more its not just violence fueled by simple vengeance. As it wends along ""Oldboy"" keeps finding new directions to explore. Oh meets a sushi chef; he impresses her by -- well lets just say the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Octopoids will be picketing most screenings. Then theres a very cool industrial magnate who takes a cruel though distant interest in Oh that leads our hero to track his life back to a seemingly inconsequential sloppiness that had massive repercussions. In the end the movie seems to be saying Everything counts. It doesnt view Oh as a victim and his life as a horror of exploitation. What happens happens. And it doesnt go in for the nonsense that whatever doesnt kill you makes you stronger. Its magnificence is that it takes itself dead serious. Its not entertainment but its sure a piece of toughness. Oldboy (120 minutes at the Landmark E Street) is rated R for extreme violence including some tooth stuff that you wont forget for a month.

Tartan Films 2005 OLDBOY15 Choi Min-sik IN Oldboy. c. Tartan Films 2005 Stir crazy -- and hungry for revenge 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Oldboy Thriller. Directed by Park Chan-wook. Starring Choi Min-sik Yu Ji-tae and Kang Hye-jeong. (Rated R. 120 mins. At the Embarcadero.) ""Oldboy"" arrives with the Quentin Tarantino seal of approval so dont expect the feel-good movie of the year This nightmarish revenge drama from Korea is grueling intense cruel -- the very definition of extreme cinema. The director Park Chan-wook is among the young filmmakers whove made South Korean cinema one of the worlds most vital. Hes known for writing plots quickly for ultra violence and queasy humor. (Check out his earlier ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance."") As with many recent Asian films ""Oldboy"" is based on a manga and has the pop excitement that form can achieve. We meet the hero Seoul businessman Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) at a police station following a drunken spree. On his release hes snatched off the street and taken to what looks like a rundown hotel room that turns out to be his prison for the next 15 years. His unseen keepers wont tell him why hes there and he has only a TV for companionship. Dae-su learns from a news show that his wife has been killed and his daughter has vanished and he is being sought by the police. The revelation and years of solitary confinement are devastating. The prisoner cracks up but maintains a frenzied martial arts practice pounding the wall until his knuckles are heavily callused. The discipline will be handy when he is abruptly set loose and told he has five days to find out why he was imprisoned. At a sushi restaurant he meets a famous female chef Mido (Kang Hye- jeong) who takes a shine to him despite his very peculiar manners. (Theres a modest amount of steamy sex in this movie.) After some speedy legwork he learns that his tormentor is smug executive Lee Woo-jin (Yu Ji-tae). More details would spoil things. Suffice it to say that though Dae-su falls for Mido he lives mainly for revenge. When he learns the story behind his imprisonment it is harrowing indeed. If you know the work of Japanese director Takashi Miike (""Ichi the Killer"") youll have some sense of ""Oldboys"" mood. These films launch a kind of assault on the audience and it isnt surprising to learn that Tarantino was head of the 2004 Cannes jury that awarded this picture the Grand Prix. The critical take is divided with one school citing Jacobean revenge tragedy and contending the movie bares the depths of the human heart while another perhaps larger group says ""Oldboy"" is just sadistic and perverse. Whichever side you take you will be impressed or appalled by such bits of virtuoso violence as the sequence when Dae-su armed with a hammer and with a knife sticking out of his back takes on a corridor full of vicious enemies. And theres an already notorious scene in a restaurant that begins when he announces ""I want to eat something live ..."" This director has a teasing side but there are viewers who cant or wont see the jokes. An ""Oldboy"" cult is already under way The films been a strong seller on DVD and an American remake (a la the Japanese ""Ring"" series) is planned for release next year which isnt necessarily good news for fans of the movie. ""Oldboy"" is also benefiting from a wave of interest in South Korean movies Works by the likes of Kim Ki-duk Kim Ji-woon and Hong Sang-soo have earned lots of critical attention. Even if it threatens to spin off into the ozone ""Oldboy"" deserves to be seen because of its relentless energy the acting by Choi Min-sik that strikes a genuinely tragic note amid the mayhem and cartoonish excess and the directors clear conviction that this wild story will resonate particularly as it zeroes in on the cost of revenge to the revenger. -- Advisory Strong violence including scenes of torture and sexuality.

And although I can slurp sushi with the best of them I tend to cringe when someone gnaws a live octopus while the poor creature writhes and flails away. Youll get to see these and other shocking spectacles (theres even worse to come) in ""Oldboy"" a Korean movie that took the Grand Jury prize at last years Cannes Film Festival. When I first saw Park Chanwooks film at the fest it was hard to see beyond well those extracted teeth -- lying in a little pile like so much bloody candy corn. But after a second more recent viewing a terrific big picture emerges. The violence remains appalling but its an essential element in this brutally inspired mystery. The low-tech dentistry the masticated octopod theyre part of the modern hell in which a Korean businessman finds himself. Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-Sik) is held captive for 15 years in the brutally intense Korean film ""Oldboy."" (Tartan Film) _____More in Movies_____  Oldboy National Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Hes Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-Sik) and he has just been bailed out of jail for drunken assault. But he stumbles into something far worse. Rendered unconscious and not sure how that happened he wakes up in an apartment from which he cannot escape. Food is handed to him through a metal opening. No one explains why he is there or how long hell stay. Oh has no idea who is behind it. The hours lead to days. Then weeks. Then years -- 15 of them. What Oh goes through during this period of captivity and what he does to get out are part of the movies unfolding mysteries. His unknown captor or captors have left him a television which becomes the Rip Van Winkle lifeline to the society hes left. He learns martial arts among many things. And more tragically he learns that his wife has been killed and hes the main suspect. What can he do? What if he punches through the wall and finds himself on the 52nd floor of a building? When circumstances lead to an escape Oh is almost dementedly focused on vengeance. Every thought gesture and action are directed toward finding who is behind this torture. ""Oldboy"" which might have won the Golden Palm at Cannes last year (jury chairman Quentin Tarantino was hot for it to win but didnt prevail) but for a political juggernaut called ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" tantalizes and tortures you as it lures you into its mysterious vortex. You die from what you see and from what you dont know. And it takes looking beyond the violence to realize the power of Chois performance. (He bears a certain resemblance to actor Gary Oldman.) He takes us through an often excruciating journey with an arsenal of emotions including half-insane glee unmitigating grief and fury. But after he meets a radiant young woman named Mido (Gang Hye-Jung) who elects to help him in his quest those dark emotions evolve into a desperate serenity. There is a conclusion to all this an existential punch line that explains everything in a climactic pileup of melodramatic detail. But whatever you make of that you will surely leave this movie shocked shaken and surprisingly moved. And definitely stuck on that poor octopus.

"Sublime revenge in Oldboy. Slate Sign In Sign Up Sublime revenge in Oldboy. Sublime revenge in Oldboy. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 24 2005 435 PM The Upside of Anger How to make a great revenge flick Oldboy. By David Edelstein Vengeance dominates the modern action cinema but to be a work of art a revenge film needs to give you something more than your sadistic jollies. It needs to show the cost of revenge to the revenger to innocent bystanders and to society--which cant survive if injustice goes unpunished but also cant survive if individuals routinely take matters into their own hands. The important vengeance sagas of our drama-- The Oresteia Hamlet such Jacobean revenger tragedies as well The Revengers Tragedy--portray revenge as both natural and cataclysmic whereas in modern movies its just action business as usual. I have found my great vengeance director now in Park Chan-Wook a galvanic 41-year-old South Korean filmmaker whose Oldboy (Tartan Films) won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Park understands the Western obsession with an eye for an eye (or an eye and a nose and many teeth for an eye) but he also imbues his Punch and Judy bloodbaths with a morbid Eastern detachment Somewhere along the way he mucks up the one-to-one correspondence between tit and tat. Advertisement Parks last film Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is one of the most twisted and disturbing Ive seen It builds to a scenario in which parallel revengers wreak havoc on each others lives. Neither is entirely in the wrong (one of the characters a father is avenging the death of his young daughter) but theres no jolt of triumph in the end--just a bloody mess and a tragic sense of waste. Oldboy has a simpler narrative architecture but its morals are every bit as twisty. Park opens with a thunderous prologue in which a mop-headed man with dark eyes dangles another man off a roof by his tie. Before we have the faintest idea whats going on we meet Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-Sik) an ordinary Seoul businessman in the throes of an epic bender on his young daughters birthday The jump-cuts as he raves in the police station capture his fractured perception and portend the horror to come. Released Oh Dae-Su staggers into the rainy night phones his daughter and then disappears--ending up in another prison a private one in which food is shoved through a hole in a door and sleeping gas pours in through the vents. He screams and bangs on the door Why is he there? Oh Dae-Su learns from a TV set that his wife has been murdered and that his blood and hair were found at the scene. He has been framed--but by whom? He slices into his arm to mark each passing year and there are 15 slices before he wakes to find himself on the roof holding a man by the tie. The vertigo of that rooftop opening presages the vertigo of the entire movie which is like a switchback ride into a swamp of bones. As Oh Dae-Su sets out to find out who locked him up--and more important why--its clear that his tormentor is beside him every step of the way controlling him addicted to watching him suffer. Its hard to say which is the more ferocious revenger the man whose wife was killed and daughter lost or the man who is pulling the strings. To reveal any more would rob you of the precious disorientation that Oldboy instills--disorientation and vertigo and nausea. Choi Min-Sik is a riveting actor with deep black plaintive eyes that seem to be turned inward gazing at his own burgeoning monstrousness; when his hair sticks up like an electrified mop it completes him. The central relationship between Oh Dae-Su and a lovely young woman named Mido (Gang Hye-jung) is tender and nuanced but the violence everywhere else is sadistic and extreme. Even the meals approach the Theater of Cruelty After Oh Dae-Su demands something living at a sushi bar he proceeds to consume a live octopus (I mean a live live octopus) before our eyes then retches and passes out. Obviously this sort of taboo-flouting imagery isnt for everyone but Parks vision is all of a piece. He came of age in a period of South Korean upheaval and in his work theres a pervasive distrust of authority combined with a pervasive lack of faith in individuals--most of whom appear to have been warped beyond salvation by an unstable society. Oldboy is a movie where you think youre in hell from the first frame--but have no inkling of the infernal circles to come. It says the only thing worse than not getting revenge is ... getting revenge. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"Oldboy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; oldboy ) Oldboy (South Korea 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Oldboy could be considered a mystery. Or a bloody revenge picture. Or a twisted romance. Or a tale of extreme karma. Regardless of how you look at Oldboy its unlike anything you are likely to have seen before. Director Park Chan-wook starts with a great premise and uses it as a springboard for a flawed-yet-compelling yarn of life-and-death cat-and-mouse games between Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) and his arch-enemy Lee Wu-jin (Yu Ji-tae) with the beautiful vulnerable Mido (Kang Hye-jeong) caught in the middle. And just when you think you know where Oldboy is headed the film takes a turn designed to foil all expectations. One rainy evening after being bailed out of jail on a drunk and disorderly charge Oh Dae-su heads home to deliver a birthday present to his young daughter. He never gets there. He is kidnapped and awakens in a cell - the location where he is destined to spend the next 15 years of his life. His captors frame him for the murder of his wife assuring that if he ever escapes he will be a wanted man. Then after 15 years he is suddenly and inexplicably set free. There is no one on the outside to provide assistance except Mido a young female chef who takes pity on him. But before Dae-su can begin a new life he must answer several key questions. Who imprisoned him for 15 years? Why? And why was he released? Only after he has answers can he exact his revenge and turn the page. Meanwhile his former captor Lee Wu-jin decides to turn Dae-sus quest for answers into a cruel game. If Dae-su doesnt solve the riddle in five days Mido will die. Oldboy is at times a brutal motion picture. Although the quantities of blood are far below that of say Kill Bill its the nature of the violence that will force members of the audience with weak constitutions to turn away. I gritted my teeth through two sequences. One involves the forcible removal of teeth and the other connects a pair of scissors with a tongue. Perhaps its the relatively mundane nature of these scenes that makes them particularly gruesome. Theres also plenty of ""conventional"" violence including a 20-on-one melee that while poorly choreographed is played as much for laughs as for action. Oldboy features a delightfully twisty story that rarely pauses to consider the logic (or lack thereof) of some of its most outrageous plot contortions. It is at times confusing and probably needs to be watched twice for everything to become clear. The revelation of the big secret is a bit of a letdown. Considering all of the build-up I was expecting something more damning or momentous. And the final confrontation between Dae-su and Wu-jin although it starts out with an appropriate level of mutual malice and tension implodes into ridiculousness before it concludes. Weaknesses aside Oldboy is consistently compelling. Since the story is told from Dae-sus point-of-view were as much in the dark as he is and we want answers. Wu-jin proves to be a top-notch villain. For every move that Dae-su makes his opponent is at least one step ahead of him. Oldboy has the kind of narrative momentum that many thrillers try for but rarely achieve. It makes the two hours fly by (although about 30 minutes could have been cut without inflicting much damage). The aspect of the film that adds a human dimension to the proceedings is the relationship between Dae-su and Mido. Revenge films like their subject matter are ""best served cold."" The warmth in Oldboy comes from the love story which is anything but traditional. Dae-su is initially suspicious of Mido - after all her arrival in his life is almost too fortuitous for it to be a coincidence - but he eventually warms up to her and she to him. The interaction between these two is touching and its one of the primary reasons why Oldboy works. The acting is solid (despite Kang Hye-jeongs tendency to whine) and Parks direction is stylish without going over-the-top. Occasional flaws are evident in his approach (such as during the crowded fight scene I mentioned above) but Oldboy offers such a display of kinetic energy that its hard not to be swept along. This motion picture isnt for everyone but it offers a breath of fresh air to anyone gasping on the fumes of too many traditional Hollywood thrillers.

Last spring when you served as jury president at the Cannes Film Festival word spread quickly that one of the films was by far your personal favorite -- and it wasnt Fahrenheit 9/11. Rather it was Korean director Chan-Wook Parks Oldboy a movie that reportedly had been added late to the festival lineup in an effort to appease both your own taste for end-of-its-tether cinema and the festivals wish to season its diet of stately auteur movies with a dollop of gritty genre fare. To none of which I hasten to add do I object. There is though one small thing thats been gnawing at me since Cannes and now that Oldboy is opening in Los Angeles theaters it seems as good a time as any to bring it up. Put simply in my humble opinion Oldboy sucks. In the interest of full disclosure I should admit that Im not a great Chan-Wook Park fan that the cult following that has sprung up around him and his films flat-out mystifies me. Though I rather liked his 2000 hit Joint Security Area in which a textbook police procedural became a way of addressing some very thorny matters of Korean national identity by the time Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) came around Park seemed to have ensconced himself in a bubble of self-conscious cool and shocks for shocks sake particularly in regard to the detachment (bordering on pleasure) with which he subjected his characters to disembowelment electrocution et al. Oldboy strikes me as a further progression in that unpleasant direction with Park completely stripping away whatever social commentary underpinned the action in those two earlier films leaving us with a not-at-all-fun house of sadism and perversity. To read ""The Tarantino Factor"" Mark Olsens interview with Chan-Wook Park click here. Of course -- as you know perhaps better than anyone else -- we happen to be living at a time when all things Asian and extreme from manga to anime to the way outre offerings of Takashi Miike are enjoying a halcyon moment in the fickle universe of fanboy enthusiasms. Yet that still doesnt fully explain why imported DVDs of Oldboy are flying off U.S. retailers shelves faster than they can stock them or why Parks film is already ranked by users of the venerable Internet Movie Database as the 93rd greatest movie of all time. What puzzles me even more dear Quentin is your own strong affection for this particular picture. We all know of course that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and your influence can be found all over Oldboy. The very premise youll have noted is basically a gender-reversed spin on Kill Bill Businessman Dae-Su (Min-Sik Choi) is released from a 15-year term of suspended animation as suddenly and inexplicably as he was plunged into it. Assisted by a beautiful celebrity chef named Mido (Hye-Jung Gang) he begins searching for his missing daughter and the persons responsible for his wifes murder. Then there are those impish sight gags (like the dotted white line that appears onscreen tracing the trajectory of a blunt object from Dae-Sus hand to his enemys skull) and an all-too-familiar indulgence in the comedy of bodily dismemberment (which Park underscores with Vivaldi instead of Steelers Wheel). But even as imitations go Oldboy doesnt measure up -- its like that Canal Street Rolex that stops ticking the second youve rounded the corner onto Broadway. When Park stages his bouts of comic book-inspired violence like the much-ballyhooed scene in which Dae-Su combats a hallway full of opponents with a ball-peen hammer they lack the deadpan elegance and staccato energy of similar scenes in your own films. They just kind of hang there on the screen flat and listless much like Dae-Su himself who has none of the gravitas of Kill Bills Bride or Dogvilles Grace -- two avenging angels for the movie-history books. For those characters vengeance is a persistent moral quandary. For Dae-Su and his infernal tormentors (by which I mean to include Park himself) it seems little more than a game the prize being a ""twist"" ending thats surprising only for how callow and unearned it is. I could go on Quentin but if I did Id be risking the ire of those who regularly accuse critics of giving too much away in their reviews. Id rather close with a nod toward the many genuinely talented young filmmakers who have helped to make South Korea a world-cinema hot spot over the last decade. Among them one case merits a special mention -- that of Hong Sang-Soo who is three years Parks elder and whose intimate Rohmeresque relationship pictures couldnt on the surface appear more radically different from Parks brand of blunt-impact cinema. Look closer though and youll see that Hong in a picture like Woman Is the Future of Man (which youll recall competed against Oldboy in Cannes) is getting at similar matters of lust jealousy and contemptible desire so directly and truthfully it leaves me incapable of feeling any sympathy for Mr. Park.

Its the perverse hard-boiled ugliness of the story to which Park has applied his talents that alienates me. For you results may vary. It takes twisted visual and narrative chops to deposit the businessman antihero Dae-su (Korean star Choi Min-sik) abruptly into solitary confinement in a mysterious prisonlike apartment thats a marvel of cheesy wallpaper cool club lighting and surrealist hallucinations (including that sci-fi bad-trip classic ants under the skin). Theres orneriness in letting Dae-su stew for 15 years. And grunge chutzpah is required to abruptly release the guy then send him into a Japanese restaurant where he bites ravenously into a plate of writhing live octopus. (The sight is a novel gross-out that would daunt the producers of Fear Factor.) As for the plot itself -- a nightmare of dislocation and shuffled memories in which Dae-su finds out who imprisoned him and why unfolding in a Grand Guignol of violence and perversion in which teeth are extracted a tongue is severed and sex is incestuous -- well the filmmaker who can dream such creepfest fantasies is the man to whom Quentin Tarantino a declared Park Chanwook admirer can tip his Kangol cap in awe. Oldboy caused a love-it-or-hate-it stir at Cannes last year and how could it not Its an onslaught made to cause a sensation. Consider me simultaneously jolted and depressed.

Major festival positioning looks in the cards but business outside Asia looks to be rather specialized for this meaty meal. A wild intensely cinematic ride into two mens burning desire to get even ""Old Boy"" falls slightly short of Korean helmer Park Chan-wooks previous feature the gripping psychodrama ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" (2002). Working with different scripters this time out Park addresses his favorite theme of revenge as more of a game as a loutish businessman locked up by a mysterious organization tries to unravel the mystery when hes released. Major festival positioning looks in the cards but business outside Asia looks to be rather specialized for this meaty meal strongly laced with cringe-inducing violence and dark sexual currents. Released in South Korea Nov. 21 pic has been a brawny hit with some 3.2 million admissions (roughly 23 million) to date as well as copping gongs for director actor Choi Min-shik and actress Gang Hye-jeong at the national Blue Dragon Film Awards. Foreign sales have already been racked up to Japan Europe and Down Under and talk of a U.S. remake is in the air -- though the sexual underpinnings of this sometimes David Lynch-like movie look almost untranslatable in Hollywoods increasingly conservative environment. Choi a legit actor whos only slowly found acclaim on the bigscreen (notably as the drunken painter in Im Kwon-taeks ""Chihwaseon"") plays Oh Dae-su a bibulous womanizer with a wife and baby daughter. After being rescued one night from a police station by a friend he suddenly disappears. Next thing hes locked up in a cell equipped like a dingy hotel room where he spends the next 15 years with only TV for company deep-fried dumplings for food and his own conscience to wrack for clues. To stay partly sane and develop a killer punch he puts to use later on Oh boxes the wall till his knuckles harden. Using voiceover and TV programs to measure the passing of time script plunges the viewer into a gripping high-concept idea darkened by Oh discovering (via news bulletins) his wife has been murdered and he has been framed for the crime. Just when hes almost succeeded in tunneling out with a pair of chopsticks hes suddenly set free waking up in a trunk on top of a building. Film keeps tightening the dramatic screws as Oh after being given money and a cell phone by a street bum wanders into a sushi bar collapses and is taken home by a waitress Mido (Gang from ""Nabi""). Shes just slightly screwed up herself as a flashback in a subway train shows (one of several blackly comic surreal ideas that pepper the early going) making the bond between the two at least acceptable dramatically. Meanwhile Oh has been contacted on the cell by his anonymous jailer who describes himself as ""a kind of scholar; my major is you."" With Midos help Oh finds out his now-grown daughter is living in Sweden. Through a series of outlandish clues -- that by sheer cinematic slight-of-hand manage to fit the pics surreal atmosphere -- Oh even tracks down the restaurant that made the dumplings he ate daily and thence the organization that kidnapped him. In a semi-stylized tour-de-force action sequence (a single three-minute lateral tracking shot) he wreaks bloody vengeance on his jailers with just his fists and a trusty hammer. As in ""Sympathy"" the opening 45 minutes are socko fluidly cut visually of a piece (with dull non-primary colors and cold blacks and grays) and atmospherically scored. Real game now starts as Ohs tormentor (Yu Ji-tae) gives him five days to solve the mysterys who and why; otherwise hell kill every woman Oh ever loved including Mido. This leads Oh on a journey (mixed with flashbacks) to high school days -- hence pics title -- but his nemesis revealed as Lee Woo-jin has an even more terrible shock in store for Oh. ""Sympathy"" subsequently maintained its grip by switching its focus to a new character and deepening the emotional texture. ""Old Boy"" has no such major change of tack. With Ohs tormentor always in charge and three steps ahead of his victim the film doesnt develop the same emotional clout which weakens the final showdown between the two. Though all the pieces of the complex plot do fall into place -- if not without a lot of expository dialogue -- the movie relies increasingly on sheer directorial smarts rather than an emotionally engrossing storyline. Whether chomping down on a live octopus (in one of several scenes that require a strong stomach) or festering with half-crazed rage and impotence Choi gives a bravura performance that powers the picture drawing on the same unkempt melancholy he showed in ""Chihwaseon"" and ""Failan."" (Some of the intensity may seem over-the-top to Western viewers but is commonplace in Korean dramas.) Gang is also very good in the key role of Mido mixing tenderness and ditziness plus good chemistry with Choi. Only Yu whos shown an aptitude for young intense roles (""Attack the Gas Station"" ""Natural City"") seems miscast as the tormentor a largely one-dimensional role that requires much more shading. The age disparity between him and Choi for roles that are only a few years apart also niggles. On a tech level pic is aces from Jeong Jeong-huns widescreen photography to Yu Seong-heuis evocative sets. Kim Sang-beoms editing is as tight as a drum until the final over-long confrontation and problematical coda. Growing use of classical music in the second half is needlessly distracting. Subtitles on version caught could be marginally improved correcting a couple of prominent typos and translating some on-screen Korean for clarity. Pic has so far received only a single offshore public screening in Harry Knowles annual 24-hour Austin fest Butt-Numb-A-Thon in early December where response by buffs was positive.
