(Handout Peter Mountain) BY Jami Bernard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday November 13 2015 1200 PM (Originally published by the Daily News on Nov. 16 2001.) The magical world invoked by J.K. Rowlings phenomenally successful books is brought fully and faithfully to life in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" a dryly funny childrens adventure set in an enchanted school. Even the shape-shifting Prof. McGonagall could not have done a better job than director Chris Columbus of transfiguring book to movie. If anything the filmed version is faithful to a fault. It is powered solely by the book and in this satellite role lacks a beating heart of its own. But that is surely quibbling in the face of precision casting and a zoos worth of specialeffects creatures. This movie will make more money than can be deposited with the deliciously wiz-ened guardians of Gringotts bank for wizards. ""Harry Potter"" will appease protective fans while winning over mere muggles (the word used by wizards for nonmagical humans). It has at least a taste of something from every page of the book A nonexistent train platform a ""sorting hat"" that knows all thats going on in the cranium beneath it and of course the rousing broomstick-flying game of Quidditch. Young Harry played with suitable pluck and gravitas by the adorable Daniel Radcliffe is an orphan who has been brought up by the very worst of muggles his coarse aunt and uncle Petunia and Vernon Dursley who board him in a cupboard under the stairs. New York Daily News on November 16 2001. (New York Daily News) On the wizards staff Not until his 11th birthday does Harry learn that he is of wizard born and therefore eligible to enroll at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry a wondrous medieval fortress filled with moving staircases terrible secrets literally moving pictures life-size chess pieces that take the game entirely too seriously and a teaching staff played by the cream of the British acting profession. Richard Harris is the kindly commanding snowy-bearded headmaster Dumbledore. Maggie Smith plays the steely Prof. McGonagall who likes to kick back between transfiguration classes in the form of a cat. Best of all is Alan Rickman as Snape a reptilian potions professor whose eyes dart faster than a whirring golden snitch on a Quidditch field. Also on campus is Robbie Coltrane as the giant Hagrid the mush-hearted Keeper of the Keys at Hogwarts who cannot resist creatures of any stripe or anomaly. One such pet Fluffy is a snarling three-headed dog and it is Harrys task during the movie to find out just what Fluffy is guarding in a wing of the castle that is off-limits to students - ""unless you wish to suffer a most painful death."" All through the movie there hangs the threat of Voldemort a wizard so bad he is referred to in hushed tones as ""You-Know-Who."" It is Voldemort who left the lightning-shaped scar on Harrys forehead and who represents the other side in the battle between good and you-know-what. New York Daily News on November 16 2001. (New York Daily News) Other key figures are Harrys closest friends loyal Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and know-it-all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). These refreshing screen newcomers nearly steal the picture from the acting royalty all around them. One of the reasons the ""Harry Potter"" stories work so well is that his world is fully grounded in boarding-school reality. Like their counterparts in more prosaic schools Hogwarts students drool over the latest-model gizmo (the lightning-fast Nimbus 2000 broomstick) and gorge on forbidden candies. Homework is a bore even if it does involve levitation and detention is a drag even if it entails tracking wounded unicorns in the Dark Forest. Columbus the director who gave us ""Home Alone"" thankfully takes a more subtle approach here with the screenplay by Steve Kloves. This subtlety is not well matched by John Williams overreaching score which tries to sell us on something we already bought. If the movie doesnt ultimately transport us to places ""The Wizard of Oz"" once took us that may be partly because ""The Sorcerers Stone"" is just the first chapter with more magic waiting to be parceled out in the coming years. But Harry Potters first venture onto the screen is a solid blockbuster. E-mail jamibernaol.com.

By Anthony Lane Who does not know of Harry Potter or of his debut this week on the big screen? Anthropologists returning from the Amazon Basin have whispered excitedly of tiny pre-industrial clans clustered along minor tributaries who have never heard of Harry or of his creator J. K. Rowling but I think we can dismiss such rumors as patronizing fantasy. On the other hand just because all sentient earthlings of reading age have turned into fanatical Potterites I can see no reason to humor their insatiable demand that the movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" should before all else be faithful to the book. If Verdi found it in himself to mess about with Shakespeare then what the director Chris Columbus and his screenwriter Steve Kloves choose to inflict on Ms. Rowling is entirely their affair. The question should therefore be Is this movie faithful to itself? Does it like the better make of broomstick have a life of its own? The plot is by now Homerically familiar. That Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is an orphan goes without saying; it is most impractical not to mention distasteful to enter the canon of English childrens literature without first being purged of ones parents. Harry however is also a wizard raised by an aunt (Fiona Shaw) and uncle (Richard Griffiths) who are not only mean and scowling but irretrievably human. At the age of eleven he is summoned back to the company of his peers to be educated at Hogwarts School. There he acquires a pair of friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) a yellow-haired nemesis by the name of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and a full complement of instructors Dumbledore (Richard Harris) the beaming headmaster and his purse-mouthed deputy Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith); Professors Snape (Alan Rickman) and Quirrell (Ian Hart) expert in the murkier arts; and a giant called Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) who is of course gentleness itself. Columbus was right to shoot the movie in England and to summon the kind of character actors in which that nation has always specialized; they are like counties or provincial parishes made flesh. His feeling for voices though and for the social positioning of his characters seems less than secure and you sense that some of the performers are taking the enterprise more lightly than others. Ian Hart normally a pointed and militant presence onscreen is strangely vague on this occasion--a pity for his role turns out to be crucial. Perhaps he loses definition when denied the chance to speak in his natural accent just as Maggie Smith crisply coy with her Scottish tones is allowed to veer a little too close for comfort toward the dotage of Miss Jean Brodie. By and large it is the actors who treat the conceit of wizardry with the greatest seriousness--like grandparents levelling calmly with small children instead of fobbing them off with fond condescension--who draw nearest to the imaginings of the author. Particular credit is due to John Hurt who invests his brief appearance as a purveyor of wands with precisely the right blend of awe and wit; he knows the tale of Harrys beginnings and he signals his concern at what manner of end the boy may have in store. In short Hurt shadows an enjoyable picture with fear--a dash of darkening that does not come again until Alan Rickman strides into his classroom. Ever since ""Die Hard"" Rickman has stolen movies as though under cover of darkness and he filches this one with a single speech ""I can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death."" His Professor Snape is a clear relative of his Reverend Slope in the BBC adaptation of Trollope; in both cases he makes you believe instantly in the potency of his own beliefs and he never scruples to make the drama watch and wait as it were while he unrolls some tasty phrasing from his tongue. At two and a half hours this is not a hurried film yet still it finds no time to linger and investigate a mood; there is plenty to dazzle but dangerously little to frighten or touch you to the quick. The Quidditch sequence for some reason is filmed at such cockamamie speed that we dont really get the chance to follow whats going on; it reminded me of a George Lucas setup which is never good news. Far more beautiful are the portraits that line the staircases of Hogwarts and that rustle into life as the pupils pass. Watch the painting behind Harrys bed in the hospital wing; as he convalesces we see a figure in the gloomy picture rise and soothe a patient of her own. That strikes me as a true special effect not a contrivance that shows itself off but a scrap of magic that gestures in sympathy toward the human. At the other extreme we have the climax of the film and the emergence of Voldemort the villain. We wait with open mouths and what do we get? Pure graphics computer-generated imagery writhing in anguish--in need of the sorcerers stone apparently although it looked to me as if the forces of ultimate evil were badly wanting the mens room. But then the entire final act of the movie in which Harry and his playmates dice with varieties of death including neck-wrapping roots and murderous chessmen has a definite air of the secondhand; I caught a blast of Indiana Jones and a more recent whiff of the Mummy. Rowling fans will point out that all these obstacles crop up in the original but that only indicates how cinematically she conceived her saga from the beginning. Such smart practice lent the books both pungency and pace but it also meant that if filmmakers simply adhered to the text--if they followed instructions--they risked venturing onto ground that would be for movie audiences old hat. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" is despite its trickery that plainest and least surprising of artifacts the work of art that is exactly the sum of its parts neither more nor less. It does the job and considering that it was directed by the man responsible for ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" ""Stepmom"" and the ""Home Alone"" films we should be grateful that it does so without inducing emesis. The child performers--who are justly given lead billing above their elders--are forthright and credible especially Emma Watson as the witch-haired Hermione. That she as a bossy swot should be made welcome by the hero is a new development in the genre; until Rowling came along there was no greater crime within the bounds of the school story than to be too clever by half. But then only a woman could have done as Rowling did; no man would have dared to revive the prep-school setting for fear of being thought archaic and uncool. Her genius was to realize that the very formalities of the tradition--the inter-house rivalry the sporting slang--were in themselves amusing and that the stuffy could be made mysterious once more. To almost every viewer of the film Hogwarts will be the sheerest invention; to those who attended British boarding schools everything about it from the pre-term purchase of arcane clothing to the London train brimming with whey-faced new boys feels like grinding neorealism--a blast either hallowed or horrific from an all too insistent past. This distinction comes to mind when one inspects the face of Daniel Radcliffe. He is friendly and confident the Harry I would guess that we had in our minds eye. But there is a tingle of knowingness in him a refusal to be taken aback that goes beyond British grit; in short he looks slightly too old for wonder and you never really doubt that he will cope. (Gossips reported that Radcliffes voice broke near the end of filming and that he had to be dubbed for a handful of lines.) Through no fault of his own he has the air not of an eleven-year-old poised between innocence and apprehension but of a budding teen-ager; the movie patches him together with Hermione as a pal yet if I were his age I would already be rolling a pencil under her desk and trying to look up her skirt. (Rowling acute as ever knew this; she had Harry flushing with awkwardness at Hermiones embrace.) ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" can hardly fail to lure the crowd as the books have drawn their millions of readers; but unlike the fiction it leaves no aftertaste--no sense of anything truly momentous being at stake. The tests that Harry undergoes are fun to observe but they remain just that whereas Rowling devised them as the trials however comically disguised of a young soul confronted with the call to grow up. Thanks to Warner Bros. Harry Potter is busy answering that call; the second movie about him will start shooting two days after the first one comes out.

To the extent that whats onscreen represents an uncannily accurate reflection of whats on the printed page the long-awaited film version of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" is a near-perfect commercial and cultural commodity. For the tens of millions of fans the world over who have taken J.K. Rowlings marvelously imaginative 1997 novel (and its three sequels thus far) to their hearts Warner Bros. smartly produced and elaborately manufactured 125 million-plus visualization will essentially make their dreams come true -- the script is faithful the actors are just right the sets costumes makeup and effects match and sometimes exceed anything one could imagine. That the picture never takes on a life or soul of its own is another matter that will have little or no bearing on how many times youngsters and even adults will return to this high-flying entertainment that looks poised to become one of the biggest-grossing films of all time. In historical terms the most surprising but apt comparison to be drawn is with ""Gone With the Wind"" another literary sensation that spawned a film version that had to meet similarly demanding public expectations. In both cases everyone had an opinion about the casting which ultimately turned out brilliantly; the authors (both female coincidentally) desired a fidelity to the text which was honored; directors were hired who could be counted upon to obediently serve the material; vast sums were spent to create the physical worlds of the novels and the producers bucked conventional thinking about running time to include all the necessary incidents. Then as now the result would seem to be exactly what the eager public is waiting for. From the point of view of protecting and thus maximizing the franchise one must acknowledge the smarts of producer David Heyman and Warner Bros. in making all the right decisions from keeping it ""British"" to realizing that a high-powered and personal filmmaker (such as Steven Spielberg or Terry Gilliam both of whom were up for the job) was not only unnecessary but actually undesirable given that textual alterations and idiosyncratic flights of fancy would have been distracting at best and irritating at worst for the intended audience. This ""Harry Potter"" is therefore a product more than a film or as the text would have it a Voldemort required to leech off another being in order to stay alive. Steve Kloves carefully accomplished screenplay begins reassuringly with a condensed version of the books opening On a quiet suburban London street owls appear a magician saps the light out of street lamps a cat turns into a woman resembling a witch and a bearded giant delivers a bundled tyke to a doorstep. The boy of course is Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) an orphan who remains remarkably cheerful in the face of the endless resentment and abuse dispensed by the small-minded uncle and aunt with whom hes been left; hes kept in a cupboard under the stairs is tortured by his bully cousin and isnt allowed to open the formally addressed envelopes that mysteriously begin arriving for him. The Dursleys are shocked when the same giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) turns up on Harrys 11th birthday to inform the lad that he is actually the son of two murdered wizards and now is welcome to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft amp; Wizardry. Even from this introductory stretch however its obvious that director Chris Columbus positions his camera very arbitrarily and has little idea how to stage action dramatically or visually build to climaxes relying instead on special effects and John Williams infernally busy score to punch up key moments. But again no matter as we are swept off into a magical world that has been physicalized to an extraordinarily appealing degree by the work of production designer Stuart Craig and his vast team the locations the effects and actors. Most important among the latter of course is Radcliffe. The boys regular features slightly shaggy dark hair clear eyes and round specs make him instantly embraceable as Harry and his performance goes on to strike the right balance between normal but not exceptional brightness and the gradual understanding of the extraordinary powers he possesses. One of the films most delightful interludes is Harrys shopping tour with Hagrid through colorful Diagon Alley where the bank is staffed by some fabulously crabby goblins that Charles Dickens might have appreciated. Harry obtains his wand from a wizened old clerk (John Hurt) who knew his father and Hagrid makes a withdrawal of the titular rock (called the ""Philosophers Stone"" in the English edition of both book and film) to spirit back to Hogwarts for safe keeping. The edifying sense of the novel materializing before ones eyes is maintained when Harry is directed to Track 93/4 to catch the special express train that will take him and his fellow first-year students Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) to Hogwarts. When at 40 minutes in the school is at last seen with the kids rowing across a lake at night toward its towering turrets and spires sitting upon a fortress-like promontory the films desired sense of wonder and mystery about what lies ahead sets in. The ""witch"" of the prologue reappears as Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) who presides over the all-important ""sorting"" of students among four houses adjudicated in the massive candle-and-torch-lit Great Hall by a delightful talking hat. Harry Ron and Hermione end up together in Gryffindor while their little nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is assigned to Slytherin where the frightening Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) holds sway. Magically a feast appears on the long tables ghosts charmingly flit about paintings come to life and the stairways switch positions without warning. At his first flying lesson Harry is discovered to be so adept at maneuvering a broomstick that hes made the ""seeker"" on the Gryffindor team in the game of Quidditch a fabulously dangerous sport that sees the players darting above an arena on brooms in pursuit of some high-velocity hard balls. The flying part is superbly pulled off visually but the Quidditch match itself while absorbing to watch is the only sequence that features an off-putting CGI feel as the camera moves are far too precise and measured and the backgrounds look too clean. In the course of a highly eventful school year a central issue emerges It seems that someone evil very likely Snape is plotting to steal the Sorcerers Stone on behalf of Voldemort a supreme wizard who went over to the Dark Side but has been short on power since he killed Harrys parents but couldnt quite finish off the boy. As they learn more the kids realize the stone lies beyond a trap door guarded by a monstrous three-headed dog incongruously named Fluffy. In a crammed succession of events that jumps directly from such book high points as Harrys nocturnal wanderings in his invisibility cloak (very nifty) and seeing his late parents in a magic mirror to slipping past Fluffy into the Devils Snare of binding tendrils and a life-sized chessboard the youthful trio has its courage and ingenuity tested to the extreme in a battle of overt good and evil. This latter section while frequently eye-popping and likely scare-inducing for little kids flattens out the narrative due to the lack of dramatic modulation and the chess match unfortunately emphasizes violence over suspense. Making matters much worse is Williams hyperactive musical score which thunders over everything never takes a rest and is completely uninterested in developing any emotional themes to evoke Harrys inner life of parental longing. Half as much music would have been more than enough at half the volume. But the cast compensates in spades particularly the adorably effusive Watson as the bright and inquisitive Hermione and Grint whose Ron Weasley develops nicely from a second banana into a valuable warrior for good. On the adult side Coltrane is perhaps first among equals as the outsized Hagrid but it is no surprise how ideally such pros as Smith Rickman Hurt Richard Harris as the white-maned Professor Dumbledore Ian Hart as the mysterious Professor Quirrell and Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw as the anxiously normal Dursleys fit their roles. The extensive effects which reportedly consumed nearly half the films budget and were farmed out to nine credited effects houses internationally under the overall supervision of Robert Legato are generally outstanding and enjoyable; some of the creature work such as the centaur even evokes the stop-motion work of pioneer Ray Harryhausen. Judianna Markovskys costume designs are also a source of continual pleasure while John Seales widescreen lensing handsomely spreads the action across the screen. Print trade-screened however was frequently out of focus and its impossible to tell whether this stemmed from lensing and/or lab problems or projection difficulties.

Comments (1) Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone I hear the J.K. Rowling books are great and on the basis of this 2001 movie Im ready to believe it; the fantasy of empowerment whereby the Cinderella-like hero (Daniel Radcliffe) takes a 19th-century train from the present back to the medieval Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is by itself worth the price of admission. I also got a kick out of some of the digital effects--especially the cat that turns into a professor (Maggie Smith) and a giant and ferocious three-headed dog. But this 152-minute movie seems both padded and undernourished. Its designed for kids whove read the books with underdeveloped characters and clunky storytelling for those who havent and portions that are too draggy or mechanically fast for anyone. The English cast is fun but the Steve Kloves script deserves better handling than director Chris Columbus has given it. With Rupert Grint Emma Watson Robbie Coltrane John Cleese Richard Griffiths Richard Harris John Hurt Alan Rickman Fiona Shaw and Julie Walters. PG.

"Harry Flies Off the Page washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Harry Flies Off the Page Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 16 2001 Bucking broomsticks talking pictures peripatetic staircases Everything is just as you might expect in Chris Columbuss ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone."" Potter-philes are sure to get what they want - if what they want is in fact an exacting version of J.K. Rowlings charming childrens fantasy. If its enchantment they are after thats quite another matter. Columbus knows his spells as well as Harrys brainy crony Hermione (Emma Watson) but he doesnt quite have the little wizards knack for making magic. Although the director has lovingly re-created the wondrous world of the novel in the process its whimsy immediacy and warmth have gone poof. After vowing to remain true to Rowlings vision perhaps he and writer Steve Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") were loath to tinker with the book. Or perhaps with Rowling prowling around the set they didnt dare. In any case the filmmakers havent reshaped the story to suit the dramatic needs of the new medium. They didnt write a screenplay so much as cautiously string the books chapters together like imitation pearls. Although Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) confronts all manner of exotic demons over the movies 2 1/2 hours he defeats the cruelest of these within the first 90 minutes. Not even the final battle between the hero and the arch-villain Lord Voldemort can live up to Harrys earlier escape from his callous Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) his bullying Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and his bratty cousin (Harry Melling). The family of ""muggles"" (Potterspeak for the magically disinclined) reluctantly took in the infant Harry after his mother and father both wizards were murdered by Voldemort. The demonic sorcerer tried to kill Harry too but succeeded only in branding a lightning-bolt-shape scar onto the tots forehead. Oliver Twist had it better than the worlds best-loved wiz kid who grows up sleeping in a cubbyhole under the closet doing all the chores and enduring his relatives verbal abuse. Petunia and Vernon are not only downright ornery they never tell him about his true origins. Then on Harrys 11th birthday he learns that he is unlike any other boy in the whole wide world. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) a gentle very hairy giant delivers the good news along with a letter of acceptance to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Then its off to the Dickensian delights of Londons out-of-the-way Diagon Alley where he is fitted for a wand and thence schlepped to Platform 9 3/4 to catch the express train for Hogwarts. Once there Harry hooks up with the headstrong Hermione Granger and the puckish Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) fellow first-year students who join the heros various escapades. The chief of these and sadly the dullest is to foil the theft of the Sorcerers Stone a big old red totem that could treble Voldemorts waning powers. Hagrid assures them that no one can get past the ferocious Fluffy the slobbering three-headed dog charged with guarding the precious stone. The wizards-in-training being as curious as Sherlock Holmes cant help investigating the matter on their own. After ruling out the shy stuttering Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart) Nearly Headless Nick (John Cleese) and the rest of the otherworldlies hanging about the children decide that the sinister Severus Snape (sneaky sneery Alan Rickman) is the mastermind behind the plot. He might even be in league with Voldemort who has recently been seen sipping unicorn blood in the Forbidden Forest flanking the campus. Columbus best known for comic treats like ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and the ""Home Alone"" movies cut his teeth writing heartwarming scripts for John Hughes. So its not surprising that he doesnt know how to direct the many action sequences that form the last half of the movie. One scene blurs into the next the changes in mood and rhythm signaled only by John Williamss maddeningly overwrought score. If the tension starts to build the moviemakers stand back to admire Stuart Craigs splendid spooky sets the magnificent medieval castle that houses Hogwarts; the grand hall lighted by a nebula of candles floating overhead; the haunted corridors attended by the silent vigil of coats of arms. And then there are the bewitching costumes and the many special effects. The moviemakers are especially taken by the computer-generated Quidditch match (a field game played on flying broomsticks). Unfortunately the video game-like sports event stops the movie in its tracks and it never quite recovers its momentum. Though the young actors are appealing competent and well cast they havent enough oomph to make light work of the long journey toward the final credits. Despite the formidable supporting cast the kids are mostly on their own as the story struggles toward its climax. When theyre on hand however the supporting cast of British stalwarts brings its own charisma to the setting. Many of them like Cleese as Nick John Hurt as the wandmaker Julie Walters as Rons mom - vanish in a wink. Coltranes big old bear of a guardian angel is the most memorable of the lot. However Richard Harris and Maggie Smith have the biggest of the grown-ups share as the wise if imperious headmaster and deputy headmistress of Hogwarts. As crowded as the castle is some characters inevitably are given short shrift. If they werent the movie might never have ended. Of course as witches and wizards well know you cant expect perfection from muggles. HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERERS STONE (PG 152 minutes) - contains intense sequences. At area theaters.

Rowlings book but the fantasy isnt very fantastic and the evil just isnt dark enough. Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Harry Potter Movies Entertainment News To be something more than escapism fantasy depends on a vision of evil that is powerful mysterious and in some sense compelling; it can be awe-inspiring like Darth Vader or J.R.R. Tolkiens Sauron or sexually alluring like C.S. Lewis White Witch. Consider Voldemort (I know I shouldnt even use his name) the evil wizard who plays the Satan-Sauron role in J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter books. As the killer of Harrys parents and inflicter of the scar that marks Harry as special Voldemort has a kind of claim on the precocious young wizard. We know perfectly well that Harry will never submit to Voldemorts dark powers -- such are the limits of Rowlings universe -- but there is still a special urgency a subliminal tingle to their encounters. To my taste the evil in Rowlings books is always a bit too constrained and contained and the befuddled ""muggles"" of the ordinary grown-up world are too easily outfoxed. (Indeed given the immense popularity of the Potter books among children and grown-ups around the globe where exactly are true muggles to be found? Osama bin Laden and Pat Robertson perhaps?) Compared to the theological and literary density of Tolkien and Lewis both rooted in a tragic vision of human nature Rowlings fairy-tale coming-of-age fantasies strike me as sweet but a little thin. I certainly dont begrudge any of her readers the immense joy they derive from her books but Im not all that interested. Go off and have your fun at Hogwarts; Ill be happier at home with the espresso-depresso crowd Ingmar Bergman Edgar Allan Poe Kierkegaard and maybe a stack of ""Swamp Thing"" comics. So unlike the Potter loyalists I have no investment in the purity or accuracy of Chris Columbus film version of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" although it strikes me in fact as a faithful and appealing adaptation. As any reasonable person would have expected its a big and often sloppy Hollywood production with some bad computer graphics a syrupy score from John Williams and a focus on storybook adventure rather than Rowlings oddball characters. Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") take Rowlings tame conception of evil and make it tamer still; when Voldemort finally makes an appearance he looks like a crypt-monster left over from ""The Mummy Returns."" On the other hand I wasnt bored except during Harrys Quidditch match which bears a distinct resemblance to the pod-racing scene in ""Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace."" Yes Rowlings plot has been trimmed and condensed but from my perspective that isnt necessarily a bad thing. Columbus and Kloves have distilled the books quasi-eccentric charms into a family-friendly spectacle alive with color and incident. More than anything else this ""Harry Potter"" is a droll Gothic set at a boarding school with a fairy-tale beginning reminiscent of ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Cinderella"" and a special-effects climax in a ""Romancing the Raiders of the Jedi"" vein. Columbus who directed the first two ""Home Alone"" pictures and such other fare as ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""Stepmom"" was viewed with considerable skepticism by many Potterites especially those across the Atlantic. His ability with child actors is evident here however and he and Kloves have manfully resisted any impulses to Americanize the setting or the material. As played with the right tone of myopic bemusement by Daniel Radcliffe -- who would also be an ideal choice for the role of the young John Lennon -- Harry Potter is a distinctly English little boy. His childhood has of course been consigned to the Cupboard Below the Stairs in the home of his dreadful Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) in Little Whinging Surrey. (One might compare Surrey to the middle-suburban zones of New Jersey or the San Fernando Valley in California but in the British imagination it is perhaps less interesting than either). You Might Also Like Harrys aunt and uncle are more figures of fun than ogres; they continue to protest that theres no such thing as magic while owls by the score divebomb their house bearing envelopes addressed to Harry by the hundreds. But Griffiths and Shaw prepare us for the films principal grown-up-oriented treat its plethora of delightful British character actors. Soon enough the bearded beefy Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) sort of a Hells Angel with a gooey center is on the scene kicking down the door and hand-delivering Harrys acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Most of Columbus film concerns Harrys career at Hogwarts as of course it should. There he discovers that he is the scion of a famous wizard family and a natural at Quidditch and embarks on heady adventures with two equally precocious schoolmates a sly carrot-top named Ron (Rupert Grint) and the know-it-all and budding bombshell named Hermione (Emma Watson). They battle a stupid but dangerous mountain troll and the fearsome slobbering three-headed monster dog named Fluffy. They encounter evidence that Voldemort who kills Harrys parents in an exceptionally lame flashback is mounting a comeback and wonder whether the sinister Professor Snape (played with fine dourness by Alan Rickman) may be covertly aiding him. All this is fine and dandy; most viewers will hardly notice or care that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" gradually loses something as it goes along something that might be called its mystical and emotional traction. The heart of Rowlings book lies in the wonder and delight of Harrys discovery that he really is someone special despite the evidence of his life so far. In Kloves screenplay this transformation happens so quickly we barely notice it. After Hagrid takes Harry on his first thrilling visit to Diagon Alley the secret Dickensian neighborhood of witches wizards and goblins hidden in the heart of London the drama and tension begin ever so slowly to ebb from the film. As usual in contemporary fantasy the reliance on special effects is part of the problem. There are lovely effects here and there like the candles that float in midair but Hogwarts the films principal setting is a disorienting visual jumble. When the students row across a lake toward the school in a night scene meant to impress us it looks obviously and even self-consciously fake like a two-dimensional miniature in the background of a 1930s Universal horror movie. On the inside its roving bands of digital ghosts moving staircases and living portraits have a jokey quality and only the faintest hint of darkness like the Haunted House at Disneyland. In the most densely computer-animated scenes like the troll attack or the Quidditch game theres a cartoonish quality that subtly undercuts Kloves graceful screenplay and its well-modulated characters. Indeed the film is so busy that two of Rowlings most beloved and august characters Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and his shape-shifting sidekick Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) become little more than background figures. But for everything Columbus film mishandles -- such as the conflict between the rival Hogwarts ""houses"" upright Gryffindor and sleazy Slytherin which will seem incomprehensible to any nonaficionados in the audience -- it remains a professional entertainment with just enough human moments to squeak by. Coltranes performance as the noble if slightly buffoonish Hagrid is the standout among the sterling adult cast and the Sorting Hat a sort of garrulous talking napkin that assigns new Hogwartians to their houses is a low-tech effect put to hilarious use. This version of the Potter saga is fun and harmless rather than memorable or imaginative. Thats certainly no crime and in this holiday season above most others viewers of all ages and dispositions will surely welcome a break from the darkness outside. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

USATODAY.com - Visually stunning Potter falls short of pure magic Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 11/16/2001 - Updated 0707 AM ET Visually stunning Potter falls short of pure magic By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone (out of four) Stars Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint Richard Harris Alan Rickman Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane Director Chris Columbus Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for scary moments and mild language. Director Chris Columbus vowed to be faithful to J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and to a certain extent he is. But one can be faithful to a plot without being faithful to the book. Harry Potter the film looks just as dazzling as readers of Rowlings captivating book might hope. But the movie ultimately lacks the books delightful whimsy and much of the sly verbal humor that made Rowlings tales so charming. Rowling wrote a book thats clever and witty as well as scary fanciful and sometimes sad. But not enough of that emotional range ends up on the screen. Read more below Audio Pottermania hits first fans in line to see movie Video Harry Potter trailer The movie actually improves on the book in its opening sequence by cutting to the chase. An owl flies across the night sky toward the stately figure of a bearded wizard walking on a deserted street. A swaddled infant bearing a lightning scar arrives minutes later sheltered in the burly arms of the towering Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) who flies in on a speeding motorcycle recalling the seminal scene in E.T. The baby is Harry Potter who becomes the ward of an obnoxious aunt and uncle. More than unloved he is forced to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs and endure constant mocking. Harrys life changes on his 11th birthday when he learns he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards who were murdered by the evil Lord Voldemort. Invited to attend his parents alma mater of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) befriends affable chess whiz Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and brainy know-it-all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). He soon learns to fly and reveals a special talent for Quidditch an airborne sport that fuses elements of soccer and basketball. But Harrys biggest challenge is to keep an evil wizard from making off with the well-guarded sorcerers stone which promises immortality and unending wealth. The production design is stunning Hogwarts with its pontificating paintings and shifting staircases; Diagon Alley a supernatural shopping mall; and Gringotts Bank overseen by shrewd goblins are all superbly rendered. The casting of elder wizards such as Richard Harris as Hogwarts wise headmaster is inspired as is Coltranes scene-stealing performance. In contrast the three younger wizards are less dynamic screen presences. As Harry Radcliffe projects an effective blend of innocence mischief and droll humor. Though his delivery is flat at times he has some endearing moments such as when he sees his dead parents in a magic mirror. His best pals Ron and Hermione are competent but not as lovable as their written counterparts. Watson lays it on a bit thick in her know-it-all portrayal. The much-anticipated Quidditch scene emerges more dangerous and hyperkinetic than the literary version amped up no doubt to satisfy a young audience accustomed to a steady diet of video games and eye-popping special effects. And a menacing chess match with exploding life-size pieces may be too intense for very young ones. Similarly John Williams overly insistent score lacks subtlety and bludgeons us with crescendos. Columbus wanted to give his movie a timeless quality and visually at least he has succeeded. Though the film will undoubtedly please the young viewers who flock to it ultimately many of the books readers may wish for a more magical incarnation.

"The new HarryPotter is all magic no emotion. Slate Sign In Sign Up The new HarryPotter is all magic no emotion. The new HarryPotter is all magic no emotion. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 16 2001 1111 AM Flat Magic Harry Potter is utterly transporting but not at all enchanting. By David Edelstein Many of those who have read and reveled in J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter adventures will be relieved that the lavish new movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone (Warner Bros.) is one of the most reverent adaptations ever produced The Bible has never been treated with such obeisance. Unlike Anne Rice who made a nuisance of herself when the same studio Warner Bros. cast Tom Cruise as the aristocratic vampire Lestat in her Interview With the Vampire (1994) Rowling insisted on approval of the director and actors; and she reportedly weighed in on details of color the architecture of Hogwarts (Harrys school for young warlocks) and the logistics of that crazed melange of rugby cricket and broomstick-whooshing known as ""Quidditch."" Aided by Rowlings hovering presence and a budget estimated at 125 million (much of it going to special effects) director Chris Columbus and his creative team have made a movie that is utterly transporting. It is one thing however to transport an audience and another to enchant it. You need more than big bucks to cast a spell. You need the magic that comes from emotion. Advertisement As a Harry Potter addict--a onetime skeptic who devoured all four books in a week and then went into a state of panicked withdrawal (it was wretched to be a muggle again)--I found the film mildly diverting. Columbus directs in a straight-ahead family-movie style that seems at first in sync with Rowlings brisk no-nonsense prose. Colors are warm and resplendent; the turrets of Hogwarts castle stretch high into the azure sky; the composer John Williams ladles on orchestral awe. (The central motif is straight out of SwanLake.) As Hagrid the massive hairy Scottish demi-troll Robbie Coltrane is as Hagrid-like as one could possibly hope for; and any film that features Richard Harris as a hoary head wizard Maggie Smith as an imperious witch Alan Rickman as a slinky sourpuss (underplaying beautifully) and John Hurt as a dithering wand-shop proprietor is guaranteed to be at least intermittently blissful--Masterpiece Theatre heaven. The three youths--Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson (smashingly Tory names arent they?)--are picture-perfect and can act to boot. (The prepubescent Watson is absurdly alluring to those of us who always went for bossy girls; when she fixed her sharp brown eyes on Radcliffe and said ""Harreh do be keh-ful"" my heart did about five somersaults.) The trappings are all there; its the feeling thats lacking. Consider the opening in which Dumbledore (Harris) and McGonagall (Smith) encounter each other outside the Dursleys home shortly before Hagrid arrives with the baby Harry. Theres a nice simple effect when Dumbledore snuffs out the street lamps with his wand and a wittier one when the shadow of a feline blooms into the shadow of McGonagall who saunters into the frame. But after that the actors just stand in the middle of the screen and say their lines--giving you plenty of time to think about how fake Harris cottony beard looks and how little sense of urgency Columbus has managed to evoke. Voldemort has murdered Harrys parents and been mysteriously violently repelled by the baby himself; the wizard universe--riven with plots and counter-plots--is now in an uproar. Why has so little of the tumult and anxiety--that mingled elation and grief--made it to the screen? If you havent read the book youll have no clue that something momentous is at stake. Ah but most of you have read the book and can supply the emotion yourself. You might even prefer it that way--along with that school of classical-music lovers that champions conductors who dont ""come between"" them and an established classic who ""serve"" the music without distracting ""interpretation."" Others myself among them consider interpretation an inevitable consequence of picking up a baton and believe that choosing not to interpret is itself an act of interpretation--albeit a timid unimaginative one. In cinema in which the director is at very least a co-composer the result of such reticence is even less satisfying. As a movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone has no inner life--no pulse--of its own Its secondhand. Advertisement That was Rowlings choice of course. She might have gone with Terry Gilliam--or better yet Alfonso Cuaron who did such plangent work in A Little Princess (1995). Jean-Pierre Jeunet (his excruciating new gamine picture Amelie notwithstanding) would have built this universe from the ground up and found an original syntax--a cinematic syntax. But Chris Columbus is a deferential fellow charming well-mannered a team player a yes-man. I was introduced to him once and he was effusively complimentary--even though Id never written a nice word about his work. Rowling must have found him the ideal literary executor. The irony is that he isnt For all his fidelity Columbus misses the big emotional beats. He moves briskly through the opening scenes with the horrid Dursleys (Fiona Shaw gets a laugh when she refers to Harrys dead mother as a ""ffffffreak"") and shows a charmingly glancing touch with the insistent owl messengers. But the elation Harry feels when he embarks on his journey to Hogwarts isnt there--we dont even get to see the old-fashioned red-and-black locomotive leave the station. Where is Harrys sense of liberation? Where is his realization that after a decade of living under the stairs in a house of derisive muggles that hes suddenly among people who share his peculiar gifts--and who treasure him? The entrance into the Hogwarts dining room--with candles suspended in the air with tables of young wizards reaching into the distance--is dazzling; but what does that matter when the Sorting Hat sequence that follows is such a bust? In the novel its clear that the hat--which determines the students all-important dorm affiliations--speaks to each freshman privately but Columbus muddles the issue so that youre not sure whos hearing what; and the highly significant exchange about Slytherin (would Harry be better off with the cozy Gryffindors or would he be spurred to greater heights by a house of overweeners?) is given no special emphasis. Columbus simply cant get into Harrys head. He doesnt even seem to realize that hes supposed to. Empathy isnt an expensive special effect. Hows the Quidditch match? Whiz-bang--but I couldnt follow it frankly. Other FX are more astonishing the lethal swarm of flying keys the staircases that continually rearrange themselves the books that scream when theyre opened the portraits that live but remain indelibly two-dimensional. Its too bad theyre housed by such a square Christmassy movie. If it was all you knew youd have no idea that Rowlings universe is such a subversively pagan one that under all the starch and twinkle is a barely containable rage at the muggle world (and a fear of that rage to complicate matters). Youd have no idea from Columbus common technique--low-angle shots of sinister people everything else in the center of the frame--of the demonic energy that went into creating Harry Potters world. Given her choice of director its possible that Rowling has no idea either. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Starring Daniel Radcliffe. Directed by Chris Columbus. (VHS and DVD. PG. 152 minutes.) If Harry Potter himself could see the movie that bears his famous name the coolly observant young wizard-in-training would be so bug-eyed his spectacles would pop off. Hed also have to have an iron butt. J.K. Rowlings mystery-adventure may have acquainted countless kids with the joys of reading but the marathon movie version has to teach them to sit still for 2 1/2 hours. Its likely they will maybe for the first time in their lives. Just about every time the magic seems to be wearing thin something astonishing is sure to occur Bricks in a wall rearrange themselves as Harry and his giant guide Hagrid -- along with the audience -- enter another reality. Pinched-faced bat-eared bank clerks hunker over their ledgers. Hanging portraits take on a life of their own. Fantastic creatures materialize a centaur and three-headed mastiff among them. Perhaps disconcertingly so does a troll thats almost too much like Shrek for comfort including getting the movies best gross-out joke. It is a reminder that the animated fairy-tale parody has some of the very qualities ""Harry Potter"" sure could use -- economy a distinctive style and sharper wit to be specific. But the magic works where it counts the creation of a whole nother world. There are spectacular segments -- a hands-off game of chess mail- delivering owls and best of all the wizardly airborne game of Quidditch. Think of it as some incomprehensible English game with zooming broomsticks impenetrable but sacrosanct rules and nasty rivalries. If such special effects and others including transfiguration and telekinesis have not yet become completely taken for granted and lost their power to amaze that day is getting closer. Fortunately ""Harry Potter"" has something else to fall back on. Rowlings neo-classic is essentially a detective story. As the 11-year-old title character Daniel Radcliffe is the embodiment of every readers imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing. Radcliffe is in good company among illustrious veteran players as well as totally winning newcomers. Sure to be a favorite hands down is Emma Watson as Harrys peer and smarty-pants would-be witch Hermione. Rupert Grint -- how English can you get? -- is a red-haired go-getter and the third corner of this triangle of schoolmates. Nobody seeing Maggie Smith as no-nonsense Professor McGonagall should have to be forgiven for being reminded of Anne Robinson. Alan Rickman as Professor Snape leaves little doubt of his villainy (""You dont want me as an enemy"" he confides believably). Big bushy-bearded Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) keeps blurting out things he shouldnt a little bit of lovableness that the big guy probably stretches too far. A nagging question too lingers Can Chris Columbus the San Francisco director accomplish with literal images what Rowlings did with words? Short answer probably not. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" is a completely admirable journeyman production. We may keep waiting for this movie to jack it up to another more scintillating level but mostly it keeps chugging along. Advisory This film contains scary elements.

Photo Hans Pennink HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERERS STONE 3 STARS Remarkably faithful consistently entertaining if overlong adapatation. Running time 153 minutes. Rated PG. At the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay the Union Square others. Adapting books for the screen is not easy to do well. Its even harder if fidelity to the original material is a major priority - and with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" it was more of a priority than in any of Hollywoods biblical epics. But screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus have succeeded in making a movie of J.K. Rowlings mega-bestseller that is almost as entertaining as it is amazingly faithful. No its not a great movie. Among other flaws its a half-hour too long. And as some critics have grumbled it neither looks like the work of a visionary director nor adds anything to the book. But there is virtue in that modesty. Realizing that the book (and the universe created by its author) do not require much adding to and that it is filmable without sacrificing too much in the way of character or incident the filmmakers took remarkable efforts just to get it right. As a result the casting is near perfect whether its young Emma Watson as the heros brainy buddy Hermione or Tom Felton as his rival Malfoy or veterans like Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall. And even if the Potter books seem darker the filmmakers resist the temptation to violate their tone by introducing elements from generic Hollywood kids movies - there isnt a single tearful or sappy moment. They realize that one of the things that makes the parallel universe invented by Rowling so beguiling for children and adults is its joyful continuity with the past and its sense of tradition as something powerfully reassuring. (The movie like the book often feels like a nostalgic idealized lament for the lost culture of English ""public"" schools.) At the same time one of the clever things about Rowlings books is the way they combine tropes from all the great popular childrens books C.S. Lewis ""Narnia Chronicles"" Frank L. Baums ""Oz"" series etc. And it happens that the themes which resonate on the page do as well on screen. Children have often warmed to protagonists trapped by some strange fate in drab households where they are not appreciated. And Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is exactly that an orphan condemned to live with his ghastly uncle and aunt and their spoiled son. Fortunately to his quiet delight Harry discovers on his 11th birthday that he is in fact the child of wizards and that his destiny is to leave the drab world of Muggles (non magic-folk) to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Soon after the schools groundskeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) takes Harry on a shopping expedition to a hidden magical part of London he finds himself on a steam train chugging through the countryside to Hogwarts. Among the marvelous things about his new school - which resembles an idealized English boarding school - is the fact that Harry is already a celebrity and happens to have inherited remarkable powers. Given that the basic rules of human nature are still in play in this parallel universe these things make him popular with some of his schoolmates and very unpopular with others. Unfortunately his heritage also makes him a target for dark forces that are approaching the school and may already have members of the faculty on their side. Excellent casting makes for effective performances throughout with the exception of a disappointingly bland turn by Ian Hart. Among the veterans Alan Rickman is better than ever as the sinister Mr. Snape and among the kids Rupert Grint steals Harrys show as his friend Ron. The school game of Quidditch an airborne combination of rugby and rollerball played on flying broomsticks and with multiple balls seemed simpler in the book but is appropriately dangerous and exciting on screen. The sets and costumes could hardly be better. But the special effects are simply too lavish at times and too reminiscent of other movies like ""The Mummy."" You wish that a little more was suggested or left to the imagination. But the visuals neither overwhelm nor substitute for the story and that in itself is a rare and good thing.

Desson Howe ""Retains (and in many cases boosts) as much of the spirit [of the book] as you could reasonably expect."" Starring Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint Richard Griffiths Fiona Shaw Director Chris Columbus Running time 230 Release Opened Nov 16 2001  Editorial Review Harry Potter Rowling good fun By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 16 2001 When I went to see ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" I made sure I sat next to the cleric. Im not talking about some intimidating bearded man clutching a book. My cleric was the 10-year-old daughter of a good friend who has read all four Harry Potter books in English and French. Nothing untoward would pass her intense scrutiny. I waited for her to note even the slightest departure from The Text with a pained sigh theatrical eye-rolling or worst of all a premature exit. Heres the big news The cleric was pleased. Well of course she had issues. Clerics always have issues. The actor (Bonnie Wright) who plays a little girl named Ginny Weasley didnt have red hair like the rest of her family. And Alan Rickman a sinister character named Professor Snape well he didnt seem evil enough. But Robbie Coltrane who plays the momentous role of Hagrid was a big shaggy hit. This was a carefully measured thumbs up. But first a ""Harry"" briefing. Based on the best-selling book by J.K. Rowling the movies about young Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) whose parents (of the wizard variety) are slain by the dreaded Voldemort. To protect Harry while he grows up wizards Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) leave the infant at the doorstep of his perfectly horrid relatives the Dursleys Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths). The Dursleys who favor their nasty son Dudley treat Harry badly trying to keep the story of his parents and their wizardry a secret. But Harry learns about his true identity (and budding magical powers) when the oversize Hagrid reappears in the Muggle (or non-magical) world to collect Harry and dispatch him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Suddenly the 11-year-old boys miserable existence becomes a life of wonder. Hes a wizard destined to acquire amazing magical abilities and to meet others like him. And down the road theres bound to be a confrontation with Voldemort whose bungled attempt to kill the infant Harry has left a lightning-shaped mark on the boys forehead. ""Potter""-the-movie is about Harry discovering his powers making friends with classmates Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and learning about the good and dark forces around him at Hogwarts. Theres much more to Harrys first term including a fast acquaintance with the airborne broomstick-riding no-holds-barred game of Quidditch; a form of in-your-face chess in which the pieces smash one another to smithereens; and a confrontation with a gigantic three-headed dog named Fluffy. Having tackled only the first Harry Potter book I am a mere dilettante of course. (The hyper-literalists and other clerics always seem to ask me if Ive read the books plural.) But Rowlings ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" is a high treat of a read with evocative characters wonderfully subtle wit and a great sense of epic adventure. It would be a near impossibility to evoke the letter of this or almost any good book. And inevitably the Warner Bros. movie is a special-effects big-moment version of a book that trades in a dynamic mixture of priceless moments big and small. Case in point In the book Harry visits a wand shop (located in a secret dimension of London) to find the perfect magic stick. It takes several wands before he settles on the right one. But this isnt dramatic enough for a movie that needs to make billions in box office and merchandising dollars. Thus in the movie Harry tries only three wands (the audience couldnt take more than that) and the first two cause enormous comical explosions in the shop. Incidentally in his cameo appearance as the wandsmith Mr. Ollivander John Hurt is terrific. The bottom line ""Harry Potter""-the-movie directed by Chris Columbus who co-adapted the book with Steven (""The Fabulous Baker Boys"") Kloves retains (and in many cases boosts) as much of the spirit as you could reasonably expect. And it makes a worthy attempt to duplicate Rowlings engaging sense of humor. The cast (thankfully British) is uniformly good. In the difficult-to-cast roles of Harrys young classmates Grint and Watson are impressive. I actually liked Rickman as Snape. And loved Coltrane as Hagrid. And in the title role Radcliffe is an utter unpretentious non-obnoxious charm. Lets hope he can complete his round of Harry roles before his voice breaks. And as a final point Warner Bros. executives please note my 9-year-old son (who also came to the screening) watched with enrapt attention and made only one trip to the bathroom. For a 2 1/2-hour movie thats no small achievement. In fact I call that rockin good news. Contains some scary noisy things a three-headed dog and giant chess pieces fighting one another.

"Not Quite A Journey To Oz - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Harry Potter Not Quite A Journey To OzMovies - REVIEW - Harry Potter and the Sorcerers StoneHarry Potter Is A Fine Film But The Magic Of The Words Isnt Quite There On Screen.November 16 2001|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticMuggles made the movie version of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.Not wizards muggles -- ordinary nonmagical folk.J.K. Rowlings phenomenal best seller about the adventures of an 11-year-old wizard at a magical boarding school is a classic of childrens literature right up there with The Wizard of Oz.But the new much-anticipated movie is a faithful literal only mildly imaginative rendering of that book. While no disgrace it is certainly no classic like say the movie of The Wizard of Oz.Kids who loved Rowlings 1997 book (the first in a projected series of seven of which four have been published) will get a big kick out of seeing it up on the Silver Screen. But most of the magic in the new film (which opens today) is on loan from Rowling.Following the screenplay by Steve Kloves (Wonder Boys) director Chris Columbus (Bicentennial Man Mrs. Doubtfire) gives us a film that takes us scene by scene through the books major moments.Nearly everything looks pretty much the way a reader would imagine the messenger owls the infant dragon the Hogwarts dining hall the Golden Snitch (with its humming-bird wings) the Mirror of Erised Diagon Alley and Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.This is both the films greatest achievement and its biggest disappointment.Yes of course you want the scenes to appear the way the book describes them. And bringing that off is no small accomplishment. But you also want the movie to offer something in each scene that youd never imagine on your own.This Columbus and Co. seldom do.If theyd captured more of the spirit of Rowlings book they wouldnt have had to include so much of its plot. At two hours and 33 minutes Harry Potter is one long kiddie flick.Early in the film we find Harry living with the Dursleys a magic-hating middle-class British family. They are the closest living relatives of our young hero whose magical parents died under mysterious circumstances when he was still in diapers.""Theres no such thing as magic"" scolds Harrys ill-tempered Uncle Vernon who however knows better.The early scenes in the Dursley home look ugly and cluttered with the camera almost always too close to the actors. At first this seems to be the filmmakers way of pointing up how restricted Harrys life with them must be.But when the scene shifts to the majestic and enchanted Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry the film often still looks cluttered and the camera is still too close.Some of the effects -- like the ""Sorting Hat"" whose folds become the lips through which it speaks -- are unexpected and witty. Others including the Hogwarts ghosts just look cheesy.Visually the film is generally very dark. In fact with the exception of a daytime game of Quidditch (a Hogwarts sport played on flying broomsticks) the darkness rarely lets up.Used strategically darkness can lend an air of mystery to a production. Overused as it is here by cinematographer John Seale (The English Patient) it just makes things look murky. (And speaking of that Quidditch match its edited so choppily that it sometimes becomes incoherent.)John Williams music is engagingly mysterious if somehow a tad too familiar. Instead of wondering what its creepiness foretells you may wonder where youve heard it before.The casting at least is spot-on.Young Daniel Radcliffe with his trademark round wire-rimmed glasses and lightning-bolt scar is an ideal Harry. Hes both unassuming and heroic which is just whats required.Rupert Grint who plays Harrys russet-haired buddy Ron Weasley has an amusingly old face and an expression that usually suggests he has just eaten a bad jellybean. And Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is an adorable know-it-all the kid in the class with her hand up first.Cast as Dudley Dursley Harrys piggy cousin chubby Harry Melling is appropriately porcine. And as Draco Malfoy a snooty Hogwarts student the towheaded Tom Felton is a bright little fascist.The supporting adult cast is practically a catalog of distinguished British and Irish thespians all of whom are terrific if somewhat underused.Robbie Coltrane (the British Cracker) is very funny as Hagrid the bushy-bearded gentle giant of Hogwarts. Fearless but loose-lipped hes always letting something slip and then regretting it.Maggie Smith is her usual lovably starchy self as Professor McGonagall. And as Professor Dumbledore the powerful and benevolent head of Hogwarts Richard Harris (Gladiator) is an endearing cross between Merlin and Santa Claus.Rounding out the distinguished cast are Alan Rickman as the dark-eyed Professor Snape Ian Hart as the stammering Professor Quirrell Julie Walters as Rons helpful mom Warwick Davis as the diminutive Professor Flitwick Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths as Harrys mean aunt and uncle and John Cleese as the jovial poltergeist known as Nearly Headless Nick.The best performance of all is a smallish one. As Mr. Ollivander the proprietor of a magic-wand shop John Hurt offers a classically crotchety yet also surprisingly otherworldly turn that brings to mind the poetic eerieness of the Alice books.""The wand chooses the wizard Mr. Potter"" he points out and we know he means much more than he says.There are layers to Hurts performance that go deeper than anything else in this muggle-made Harry Potter. He seems to have stepped through a looking glass from some far more magical film.

By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Theres little point in announcing to fans of J.K. Rowlings enormously popular ""Harry Potter"" novels that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" has finally hit our movie screens -- even Warner Bros. selection of Chris Columbus as the films director was covered with the kind of zeal that normally accompanies cardinals picking a Pope. Well now you get to see the finished product and most Potter obsessives will find something to applaud before the credits roll. But the British press advance word that Columbus has whipped up a fantasy film masterpiece is overstated to say the least. ""Perfunctory"" would be the best way to describe his approach to the material. Those of you who already have the plot permanently tattooed on your cerebellum can speed-read this part Young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives with his piggish aunt uncle and cousin on suburban Privet Drive somewhere in England. A lightning bolt scar on Harrys forehead and his ability to make magical things happen when hes fearful or angry suggest that hes a special person indeed. One stormy evening a towering man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) steals Harry away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where Harry whose name is spoken by the schools professors and students alike in hushed tones will be trained to fulfill his calling as a world-class Wizard. Triumph of casting Hogwarts a production designers dream is crawling with enchanted characters and even a few enchanted stairwells. Harrys teachers are among others Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) Transfiguration Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart) Professor Flitwick (Warwick Davis) and Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) a creepy expert on the art of potion-making. Harrys enchanted classmates include Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and a particularly snotty kid named Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Eventually Harry Ron and Hermione will take part in a twisted adventure that includes an excitingly staged battle with an angry troll a dangerous skirmish with life-size chess pieces and a couple of encounters with Fluffy a snarling three-headed dog who could conceivably swallow the kids whole. First and arguably foremost ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" is a triumph of casting. You can tell that a lot of care went into matching the perfect actor with Rowlings evocative descriptions. Happily the proper performers are genuinely talented. Coltrane stands out (and up) as the likeable if dim Rubeus but Rickman steals the show as Professor Snape. His mellifluous voice slides around syllables like a snake crawling up a tree trunk. He really is frightening at times even though the movies overall tone is pitched toward tongue-in-cheek humor. Trying not to offend There are of course numerous set pieces ... almost too many when you get right down to it. An early visit to Gringotts Bank which is run by grotesque goblins who look like dehydrated Hume Cronyns is beautifully realized. But the goblins get dumped in a matter of minutes in the headlong pursuit of several other painstakingly created semi-scenes. Later seven or eight minutes are spent on Harrys introduction to the game of quidditch which comes off as a variation on the airborne motorcycle chase in ""Return of the Jedi."" Its entertaining enough but its a suck-up to generic blockbuster expectations when Rowling has created mysterious events that are far more worthy of the extra screen time. Challenging the chess set in ""Harry Potter"" Lest we forget Columbus last three movies were ""Nine Months"" ""Step Mom"" and ""Bicentennial Man."" If he were capable of out-Spielberging the competition -- that is making a fantasy film that floats rather than stomps -- surely he would have done it before now. The problem with ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" -- not that its a mess -- is that Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book the so-called narrative is more like a jamboree inside Rowlings head. When you consider that the highlights of Columbus filmmaking career before now were Macaulay Culkin belting Joe Pesci with a can of paint and Robin Williams accidentally setting his falsies on fire in the kitchen this could have been a disaster. Ultimately ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" rises and falls on the waves of Rowlings rightfully celebrated imagination and that will be more than enough for it to make a zillion dollars. Once it does that even partial naysayers will be forced to retreat for fear of being clocked with a broomstick. Parts of ""Harry Potter"" are intense enough to scare very young children but kids who are familiar with the books will probably laugh at even the most frightening beastie. Fluffy in particular is enough to make anyone a little nervous. To be honest the final 40 minutes arent too far removed from ""The Goonies.""

To say this screen adaptation of J.K. Rowlings wildly successful book has kids and their parents champing at the bit is an understatement on par with saying Michael Jackson has had just a little work done on his nose. The making -- and marketing -- of this film has been planned like the invasion at Normandy and this is D -- or should that be P -- day. The screenplay by Steven Kloves (""Wonder Boys"" 2000) with plenty of input from Rowling herself covers most of the bases from the original material. In fact at times the film feels overly stuffed with ""moments"" from the book. Its as if the filmmakers were afraid to leave out any fans favorite moment so they jammed in a little taste of everything here and there. That said overall the sheer magic of the movies spirit saves the day. We first met Harry as an orphaned infant at the time hes being placed on his aunt and uncles doorstep by the headmaster and headmistress of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. These two imposing figures Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall -- played respectively by the indomitable Richard Harris and Maggie Smith -- couldnt be better cast. These two British acting veterans are the perfect personification of Rowlings literary characters. Ditto for the casting of Robbie Coltrane as gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape Zoe Wanamaker as Madame Hooch and John Cleese as the Nearly Headless Nick. Radcliffe perfect as Harry But the whole success of the film falls on the casting of the three best friends who enter Hogwarts together as first-year students Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Harry Potter himself (Daniel Radcliffe). Young Radcliffe -- with his turned-up nose round black glasses and wide-eyed aura of beguiling amazement -- is perfect as Harry. He may not be the acting phenomenon that is Haley Joel Osment but he is a whole lot better than poor Jake Lloyd from ""Star Wars Episode One."" Radcliffe did have some acting experience; Watson and Grint did not but they also acquit themselves extremely well. Watson has just the right degree of brainy smugness while Grint plays the clown to perfection. After introducing us to Harrys muggle (i.e. human) aunt and uncle Vernon and Petunia Dursley (played by Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) and depicting the treatment poor Harry gets at home the story quickly advances to his admittance into Hogwarts. Soon young witches and warlocks-in-training are playing Quidditch games on broom sticks dragons are being hatched three-headed dogs are attacking and candles are floating in thin air. But there is evil afoot at Hogwarts and Harry and his friends must find out what it is before the school and maybe even their fellow students are destroyed. Not edgy or dark Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"" 1990 and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" 1993) promised to stay faithful to the book and he did. However his touch can be a little too sentimental and light. There could have been a little more weirdness edginess and darkness to this story about magic spells dark incantations and rampaging Orcs. Other directors purposed for the film included Ivan Reitman Steven Spielberg and Terry Gilliam. Of the three it would have been very interesting to have seen Gilliams take on this material. But never mind. Daniel Radcliffe (center) stars as Harry Potter. Special effects be damned nothing replaces good old-fashioned imagination. Many lovers of the book will have already imagined the story in a much more spectacular way then any movie could ever achieve. But the production design is a marvel thanks to Stuart Craigs detailed sets while Judianna Makovskys costumes are unique. There have already been four Potter books published and supposedly three more are on the way. The second movie ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is already in production for a release in 2002. Lets hope that the following sequels will be allowed to tackle the darker sides of the Potter legend. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" is not perfect and it could have been better. But it will please more than it disappoints and it will make millions. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" opens nationwide on Friday November 16 and is rated PG.

The happy corridors of this possessed castle-on-the-lake are hung with portraits that talk and are lined with shifting staircases that take thrilling detours. There are humongous trolls and baby dragons. There are cobwebs and broomsticks and other levitating objects such as the constellation of candles that floats above the tables in the dining hall.Hogwarts - that bailiwick where students are taught the uses of evil and enchantment (and apt pupils learn the distinction between the two) - is the unbilled star of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone the eagerly awaited film from J. K. Rowlings beloved novel which will open nationally on Friday.Harry Potter the movie is more magic than Muggles (as non-magical persons are known) but only just.At its best the films visual dazzle equals the tasty wordplay of the novel. But it is overlong overscored and curiously misshapen. While the focus of Rowlings saga is the 11-year-old male Cinderella who learns that he is a charmed prince of wizards the focus of director Chris Columbus film is Hogwarts. More than occasionally the elaborate sets overwhelm the characters in this primal account of that supercharged and in this case supernatural passage from childhood to maturity. (As befitting a boy on the cusp of manhood Harry must prove his mastery of snake wand and broomstick. Freudians will note that these are phallic symbols but also representations of wickedness and wizardry.)The films magic moments wed psychology with physics. Harry (bespectacled Daniel Radcliffe who resembles a boy Beatle) has spent his life as a virtual prisoner in the suburban home of his Muggle aunt and uncle. Only dimly aware of his powers Harry has never conjured his freedom. Only when a giant named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) comes bearing his acceptance letter to Hogwarts does the orphan with the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead see a way through the brick wall of boyhood.First Hagrid and Harry find a chink in a London wall that opens onto Diagon Alley Main Street for Merlins where our hero buys his first wand. Then they wend their way to Kings Cross rail station where Harry passes through the masonry to Track 9 3/4 and boards the Hogwarts Express. The Magical Mystery Tour is coming to take you awayOn the train Harry meets two friends whose attributes complement his and complete him. There is the carrot-topped Ron (Rupert Grint) and the wild-maned Hermione (Emma Watson). In the way that Ozs Tin Man Scarecrow and Cowardly Lion illustrate the quest for heart brains and nerve Ron Hermione and Harry personify heart brains and courage. The challenge before them is how to bring these traits into balance.Much of the primal stuff is nicely done. In particular Harrys realization that everyone knows more about him than he does elegantly establishes the tone of preteen paranoia. Less gracefully handled is Harrys passage from nonperson to personage and Hermiones from know-it-all to wisdom. While I salute Steve Kloves for a screenplay that telescopes so much of the novel I wish he had trimmed a set piece or two and allowed the characters to transition less abruptly. The characters of Ron and Hermione emerge but Radcliffes Harry alas comes across as rather flat. Too often John Williams intrusive score upstages Radcliffes performance.Hogwarts as partisans of the book know is divided into four competing schools. But as seen through Columbus eyes it more resembles an upscale summer camp during color war week than an academy of witchery and wizardry.At this Hogwarts there is greater emphasis on sports and spells than on studies. And the films main set piece an epochal match of quidditch (airborne polo played on broomback rather than horseback) takes us inside a video game rather than a magical world.Yes as omniscient headmaster Albus Dumbledore Richard Harris - that Arthurian aura still clinging to him - looks as if hes about to lead his charges in a chorus of ""Camelot."" And no I dont know why the mountain troll bears an unmistakable resemblance to Shrek.While most of the PG-rated film is suitable for imperturbable 6-year-olds and 8-year-olds there is one sequence involving brutal chess pieces that may be too intense even for older kids. I expect that more than a few stalwart 10-year-olds will dive for the safety of a parental lap during this scene.Carrie Rickeys e-mail address is crickeyphillynews.comHarry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone Produced by David Heyman directed by Chris Columbus written by Steve Kloves based on the novel by J.K.

"Magic by the Book - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Magic by the Book`Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is an imaginative and remarkably faithful adaptation but it shuns any risk-taking.November 16 2001|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC When you spend in the neighborhood of 125 million on the most widely anticipated literary adaptation since ""Gone With the Wind"" you want to get what you paid for. With ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" Warner Bros. has gotten just what it wanted and that is simultaneously satisfying news and something of a disappointment.When a studio is dealing with an author like J.K. Rowling whose books about a young boys quest to be the wizard he was meant to be have sold more than 110 million copies in 200 countries the overriding mandate is to protect the franchise. Like hulking NFL offensive linemen signed on to safeguard a valuable quarterback every ""Harry Potter"" hire from director Chris Columbus on down was made with an eye toward ensuring that those hordes of fanatical fans werent disappointed. As screenwriter Steve Kloves told Vanity Fair ""Id be lying if I said youre not aware that youre adapting the most beloved book in the world.""Inevitably the result is a remarkably faithful copy of the book that treats the text like holy writ (hence its 2-hour-and-33-minute length.) From the gold in Gringotts the safe-as-houses goblin-run bank to the centaur lurking in the forbidden forest that adjoins Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry so much is presented just as written that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" starts to resemble one of those fiendishly exact replicas of great works of art that Sunday painters can be seen working on in galleries of museums. FOR THE RECORD Los Angeles Times Saturday November 17 2001 Home Edition Part A Part A Page 2 A2 Desk 1 inches; 34 words Type of Material Correction ""Harry Potter"" caption--A caption accompanying a review of the film ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" on Page F14 in Fridays Calendar misidentified an actor and the character portrayed. The photo shows Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell.For those who remember the mincemeat Hollywood has made out of their favorite books this fidelity has a lot going for it. Certainly ""Harry Potter"" has nothing in common with ""The Sea Beast"" the 1926 version of ""Moby-Dick"" that gave Captain Ahab a last name and a girlfriend he comes home to after killing the white whale a young woman who says in the films most unforgettable line ""Why Ahab Ceeley youre crying.""But copies even ones as impressive as ""Harry Potter"" can by definition only go so far. Copies dont provoke passionate responses of either agony or ecstasy; copies dont leave much to object to or get excited about. Ideally as in something like ""The English Patient"" or ""The Godfather"" a film will extend or even transcend the books emotional territory and bring a touch of cinematic poetry to the proceedings. But to get that you have to take risks and risk is something no one associated with this project wanted anything to do with.Still it wont do to be unyieldingly grumpy about ""Harry Potter."" Its easily the best film of Columbus lightweight but lucrative career (""Home Alone"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" ""Stepmom"") and its crack production team (including the costume designer from ""A Little Princess"" Judianna Makovsky; and two of ""The English Patients"" Oscar winners cinematographer John Seale and production designer Stuart Craig) has re-created Hogwarts and environs with a fine visual brio.And there are moments--not nearly as many as wed like but still moments--when some of the magic of the books rubs off on the screen. The curmudgeonly way the sorting hat goes about its business of assigning new Hogwarts students to their houses the mad jumble of Diagon Alley the rough-and-tumble excitement of the schools signature game Quidditch; all are conveyed as we might have hoped.What ""Harry Potter"" also has going for it is its casting of the trio of Harry and his pals. Amazingly only one of them Daniel Radcliffe who brings an even-keeled decency to the role of 11-year-old Harry has had professional experience playing David Copperfield in a BBC television production. Though you wouldnt guess it (director Columbus experience with child actors is probably a factor here) neither Emma Watson as the smarty-pants Hermione Granger or Rupert Grint as the loyal Ron Weasley had acted outside school plays before.Though the ""Harry Potter"" team had its pick of performers for the adult parts not all its choices are as successful. Only one actor brings his role completely to life and that is the first adult cast as well as a personal choice of author Rowling Robbie Coltrane as 8-foot-tall Hagrid Hogwarts formidable Keeper of Keys and Grounds.Although some of his fellow adults seem to be overly conscious of the responsibility of re-creating universally beloved characters Coltranes lively unabashed spirit and sense of fun make Hagrid as real as a hairy half-giant who carries a pink umbrella could possibly be. The inspiration hes told journalists came from Rowling herself who suggested he think of his character ""as one of those really big Hells Angels who gets off a motorbike and then starts talking about how his garden is coming.""1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHarry Potter-themed Whimsic Alley and Warner Bros. settle lawsuitDecember 4 2013Richard Griffiths Uncle Vernon in Harry Potter movies has diedMarch 29 2013Box office How Twilight and Harry Potter are radically differentNovember 19 2012David Thewlis is the Anonymous actor whos everywhereJanuary 12 201210 questions on Harry Potter land at Universal Studios HollywoodDecember 1 2011Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/16/entertainment/et-turan16,200,harrypotterandthesorcerer'sstone23,harrypotterandthesorcerer'sstone,latimes

Posted October 17 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Early on in Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone theres a bright bubble of shared aha that seems to burst from a collective moviegoing consciousness shaped by a thousand fairy tales. It happens when the orphaned 11-year-old Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) having only recently discovered that hes meant for a more heroic life than the scullery-boy existence he has known to date is first introduced to the privileges of wizardry. Accompanied by a hairy comradely giant emissary called Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) Harry leaves his hateful bullying aunt and uncle horrid cousin and their priggishly middle-class house at 4 Privet Drive. He and Hagrid hightail it to timeless bustling London a place bathed in Christmas-card-colored light. There the two buy supplies for the boarding school experience that is about to change Harrys life--and has already changed the course of childrens reading habits around the world. Author J.K. Rowling writes vividly about the anti-shopping mall known as Diagon Alley describing Gringotts bank; the bookshop perfectly named Flourish and Blotts; and the emporia where Harry and Hagrid examine broomsticks and wands for the boys coming curriculum at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. (Any kid who has ever circumnavigated the sameness of the Gap and Foot Locker on a mall-crawling Saturday afternoon appreciates the differentness of Diagon.) And in one sweeping party-host welcome director Chris Columbus brings this secret garden to visible life. Accompanied by a glittery dusting of cinematic-magick theme music from John Williams the director who mythologized middle-class 1990s family life in Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire translates places previously imagined by millions of readers into shiny images absorbable by millions more. These are pictures so inevitable (to a populace raised on David Lean epics and Macaulay Culkin vehicles) as to provoke a shiver or a sigh This long dense special-effects-laden movie crammed with subplots involving dragons ghosts bullies evildoers and moments spent in front of the dark tantalizing Mirror of Erised that reflects Harrys sad longing to be reunited with his dead parents feels as familiar as worn flannel. That sense of deja vu is at once this Harry Potters balm and its limitation many charms but few surprises. So this is the way to Hogwarts and its tie-in merchandise Heres the Obi-Wanish headmaster Albus Dumbledore embellished by Richard Harris with a touch of Gladiator majesty; heres the feline professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith purring with vocal references to her prime as Miss Jean Brodie); heres the sinister Potions professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and the stuttering Quirrell (Ian Hart) who instructs in Defense Against Dark Arts. Even smaller roles are filled by some of Britains grandest thespians--Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia Dursley Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon Zoe Wanamaker in an electrocuted hairdo as broomstick coach Madame Hooch--and each throws himself or herself into the task with the passion of Olivier taking on Henry V. (Rickman is practically incandescent with purpose; he emits a high-voltage zap of electricity with every glare.) The casting of the student wizards is no less meticulous. Radcliffes mature self-possession his soft handsomeness and unfussy sweetness as Harry play off the Our Gang gung-ho spirit of ginger-headed Rupert Grint as classmate Ron Weasley. Emma Watson summons the know-it-all imperiousness of Hermione Granger. And early on--for the first 30 60 even 90 minutes--Columbus intrinsically American-style polished fidelity mixes with Rowlings intrinsically English-style eccentric storytelling well enough to create an accessible movie built to satisfy readers welcome novices and support sequels. The interpretation may be lacking the thrilling childs-eye terrors of say Neil Jordans The Butcher Boy or the surrealism of Lindsay Andersons great 1968 boarding school fantasy If.... But the movie makes up for its lack of directorial originality with for instance an excellent demonstration of how to play Quidditch the Hogwarts specialty sport combining aspects of soccer and hockey and executed in the air on broomsticks. Yet without that personal touch the movie eventually drags through the air rather than flies; at some two and a half hours its one long game of heroes-and-challenges. By the time Harry faces the evil Lord Voldemort Harry Potter tilts overloaded with fact at the expense of magical fiction. Still this is an engineering problem that ought to be correctable. ""Its really the wand that chooses the wizard"" Mr. Ollivander (John Hurt silky and intense) tells Harry when the boy receives his special stick with which he will learn to do wonders in years (and sequels) to come. Rowlings writing stick is naturally sharp steeled with wit; Columbus wand--made in America of modern Hollywood materials--is naturally soft. But surely theres a magic Hogwarts potion somewhere that can be ingested by the filmmakers before Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets comes out next fall isnt there? That at any rate is what this fan sees when she looks into the Mirror of Erised which as Dumbledore explains ""shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts.""

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

(A lot of kids to be sure.) Grown-ups who were equally bewitched by J. K. Rowlings book felt let down by the movie it followed the letter of the tale but missed the spirit mistaking special effects for magic. Would the filmmakers learn from their mistakes in the second installment? Wanting to give the movie the benefit of the doubt I avoided reading ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" before I saw Columbuss follow-up. This time the twists and turns of Harrys adventures at Hogwarts--where he encounters even greater perils--could take me by surprise.The real surprise alas is that ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been turned into a kiddie monster movie. It is aimed at an older audience this time--tween and teenage boys. Now the walls of Hogwarts are defaced with dire warnings written in blood. Harry and Ron are terrorized by an army of giant spiders that scuttle about like stragglers from ""Starship Troopers."" Our hero no longer the diffident uncertain wizard wields a sword in mini-Schwarzenegger style as he faces down a gargantuan snake that is sure to traumatize the under-6 set and just as likely to produce yawns from elders who have sat through one too many creature-filled Hollywood action extravaganzas. Somehow I dont think this is what Rowling had in mind. The monsters are all straight out of the book but they are vanquished briskly on the page. Rowling never belabors the violence; Columbus cant think of anything else to do. For him the action set pieces are the movies raison detre and they contribute mightily to the bloated 2-hour 45-minute running time.Before it degenerates into Indiana Potter and the Chamber of Doom the movie holds promise. Cinematographer Roger Pratt has replaced John Seale and the images are crisper and less murky. The three young stars--Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson--radiate a newfound confidence. Kenneth Branagh adds a nice flourish of comic relief as Gilderoy Lockhart the celebrity Defense Against the Dark Arts professor whose towering self-regard is matched only by his magical incompetence. Further chuckles are supplied by the computer-generated Dobby the House Elf (voice of Toby Jones) a mischief-making masochist whose servility disguises his true intentions. Alan Rickman the highlight of ""Sorcerers Stone"" takes a back seat here; villainy honors go to Jason Isaacss Lucius Malfoy (blond father of blond Draco). Isaacs memorable as the bad Brit in ""The Patriot"" oozes freeze-dried evil. Sadly the recent death of Richard Harris adds a special poignance to his final turn as the great wizard Dumbledore. His sweet whispery line readings sound as if theyre etched on delicate aged parchment. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Columbus has boasted that ""Chamber"" is faster paced than the original because its not bogged down with exposition. He doesnt seem to realize that the exposition--also known as character development--is what gives the tale charm. Someone coming to this movie without having seen the first would have no sense of what makes brainy supercilious Hermione special. Steve Klovess script is so busy keeping the action coming that the quirks of Rowlings characters get lost. Yes ""Chamber of Secrets"" moves with a brisk stride but speed isnt necessarily an improvement if it flattens out the emotional landscape. ""Chamber of Secrets"" seems even more an impersonal studio project than the first--a trend that perhaps Alfonso Cuaron (""A Little Princess"" ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") the next installments gifted director can buck if Warner Bros. lets him.Columbuss movie ends (Im not giving anything away) with a standing ovation in the Hogwarts dining hall thats meant to be a rousing emotional moment. But oddly the object of the celebration hasnt done anything in the course of the movie to warrant the outburst--hes been on the sidelines of the action. The scene which isnt in the book is just a generic feel-good climax arbitrarily pasted on and the filmmakers obviously think nobody will notice. But it hints at why the Harry Potter movies arent half as wonderful as they ought to be why they feel created from the outside in.

"Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; harry-potter-and-the-sorceror-s-stone ) Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone (United States/United Kingdom 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Harry Potter phenomenon - and make no mistake it is a phenomenon - is unlike anything we have seen in recent history. Rather than being the result of clever marketing and hucksterism Harry Potters popularity began at the grass roots level. And whats more this craze is not derived from a movie video game or television series but from one of the oldest forms of mass-market entertainment a book. Of course now that the cats out of the bag the marketing has begun in earnest. There are Harry Potter lunch boxes trading cards toys wrapping paper etc. But its important to remember that these things followed the phenomenon they didnt drive it. Much has been written about why Harry Potter is so popular with readers of all ages. While this analysis is fine all you really have to do is read a few chapters of any of the Harry Potter novels and youll understand the appeal. Author J.K. Rowling has developed an intensely likable hero and put his adventures on paper with a free-and-easy style that mixes high adventure with light drama and low-key comedy. The books manage to walk the literary tightrope of never taking themselves too seriously while avoiding the easy pitfall of self-parody. That tone is what Chris Columbus motion picture adaptation strives for and for the most part achieves. Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is unquestionably a member of the fantasy genre. However while the majority of fantasy novels strike a tone that straddles the somber and the ominous Rowling keeps it light falling somewhere between that of David Eddings Belgariad and Piers Anthonys A Spell for Chameleon. Harry Potters most apparent antecedents are J.R.R. Tolkiens The Hobbit (which is written in a much lighter style than The Lord of the Rings) C.S. Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia and Lloyd Alexanders The Chronicles of Prydain. Like Harry Potter those books find their most enthusiastic supporters in the bracket of ages 10 to 15 but feature enough character development plot and thematic content to attract an older audience. Yet in large part because of its contemporary setting Harry Potters popularity has greatly outstripped those of its predecessors. And to call the Harry Potter novels ""childrens books"" is to underestimate them. The only people who apparently do not like the stories are the religious fundamentalists some of whom are leveling the same charges at Harry Potter fans that they accused Dungeons and Dragons players of 20 years ago. After the Harry Potter novels became a huge international success the one-word question regarding the movie adaptation became ""when?"" not ""if?"" Initial reports indicated that Steven Spielberg would direct Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone but for whatever reason (and there are about a hundred rumors flying around) Spielberg backed out leaving the door open for Chris Columbus the crowd-pleasing filmmaker who was behind the camera for Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone (as well as lest we forget Stepmom and Bicentennial Man). At the outset Columbus and Harry might not seem to be the best match but with Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone Columbus proves at least one thing - he can make the story accessible both to those who are familiar with the source (probably the majority of those who will see the film at least in its theatrical release) and those who arent. Columbus will also direct the second Harry Potter movie; current rumor claims that Spielberg wants to do the third. The movie opens in modern-day England on the small rural lane of Pivet Drive where 11-year old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) dwells with his aunt uncle and cousin. Harry has lived with his mothers sisters family since shortly after birth when his parents were murdered by the evil wizard Voldemort. Voldemort tried to kill the infant Harry as well but failed leaving the boy undamaged except for a scar on his forehead. After that incident Voldemort vanished never to be heard from again. Now on his birthday Harry is visited by the imposing Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) who has come to bring Harry to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he will study to fulfill his true calling as a wizard. After a trip with Hagrid to buy supplies (including a wand a snowy owl and a cauldron) Harry arrives at Hogwarts. There he meets classmates who will become close friends such as red-haired Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and bossy Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and antagonists such as the arrogant Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Then theres the headmaster of Hogwarts the venerable wizard Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and his staff - Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) who teaches Transfiguration; Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart) whose course is Defense Against the Dark Arts; Professor Flitwick (Warwick Davis) who teaches Charms; and Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) master of Potions. For Harry however theres more to attending Hogwarts than studying as he begins to suspect one of the teachers of being in league with a dark force lurking in the forest. Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a rigorously faithful adaptation of the novel. With the exception of occasional details short scenes and a poltergeist everything in the book is in the movie. And at least 75% of Steve Kloves dialogue is lifted directly from the text. For Harry Potter fans looking to see how their favorite scene appears on screen this is a boon. But theres something almost workmanlike about Columbus approach to the project. Movies and books are different media and the best approach for adapting the latter into the former is not always an unvarnished translation. Columbus doesnt use any imagination beyond that which J.K. Rowling previously supplied for her book. Theres no denying that the film is diverting but it isnt inspired. One of the most delicious aspects of reading the books is absorbing all of Rowlings offhand comments. Columbus and Kloves straightforward approach fails to find a creative way of incorporating these. Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone delivers as promised - a herd of colorful characters fast-paced inventive adventure liberal doses of comedy and even a little pathos. The film runs 2 1/2 hours but doesnt seem that long and all but the youngest children should be able to sit through it without becoming restless. The movie also has the virtue of not talking down to its viewers meaning that adults wont be uncomfortable viewing this film even if they arent chaperoning offspring. Just as the Harry Potter books have reached a wide audience so too does the movie appeal to audience members of all ages. The film has its share of standout sequences. The first is a battle featuring Harry Ron and Hermione against a big ugly troll. The second is Harrys Quidditch debut. And the third is the final showdown. From a visual standpoint the film has its moments but is far from overwhelming. Hogwarts looks suitably impressive the troll and goblins are convincing and most of the magic is nicely represented but the flying sequences are disappointing not looking a lot better than when Christopher Reeve donned his cape for Superman. One would think that in this era of digital special effects the filmmakers could have done a little better masking the blue screen work. The three pint-sized leads - Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson - are all unknowns. Radcliffe who appeared in The Tailor of Panama is the only one with previous experience. The decision to cast unfamiliar faces is a good one since none of the actors bring baggage with them. What they lack in polish they make up for in earnestness. Presumably they will become more accomplished as the series advances. On the other hand most of the adults are played by recognizable performers - Richard Harris as Dumbledore Alan Rickman as the serpentine Snape Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. There are also several big names in small roles - John Cleese as a nearly-headless ghost John Hurt as a wand salesman and Julie Walters as Rons mother. J.K. Rowling has given her full support to the finished project gushing how closely it meets her vision of what the characters and their world should look like. Fans of the book will likely love or hate the movie based on how closely things match their preconceived notions. Viewed exclusively as a piece of cinema - something extraordinarily difficult to do with this property - Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone stands out as a solid piece of entertainment. The films spell may not be as potent as that of the book but theres still some magic in what Columbus and his crew have wrought.

"Harry Potter leaps from the pages to the screen in a magical transformation - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Harry Potter leaps from the pages to the screen in a magical transformationHARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERERS STONE (star)(star)(star)November 16 2001|By Mark Caro / Tribune movie reporter.If the movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone were released in a parallel universe in which J.K. Rowlings book didnt exist its richly envisioned world and inventive engaging story could be appreciated in their own rights.Few family movies offer such imagination-tickling elements as Platform 9 3/4 (the hidden platform where wizard kids catch the train to the boarding school Hogwarts) the Sorting Hat (which when placed on a kids head determines which of four rival school houses the student will join) Quidditch (the high-flying high-speed basketball-meets-soccer-on-broomsticks game) and Hogwarts ever-shifting staircases and wall portraits in which the subjects move inside the frames."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt;The overall premise also boasts an undeniable appeal An 11-year-old British boy -- living under the stairs in the house of his mean aunt uncle and cousin -- learns that hes a famous powerful wizard heads off to wizards school and heroically battles evil.Asking for a kids movie to provide much more seems a bit Grinch-like. Yet ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone wont be playing to a blank-slate audience. Given that Rowlings four Harry Potter books have sold more than 100 million copies including 45 million of the introductory entry that spawned this movie more viewers will be arriving at the theater with preconceived notions than for any prior film in history.The movie deserves to be judged first and foremost on how it works regardless of its fidelity to the book. At the same time comparisons to the book unavoidable for many viewers anyway help pinpoint where some of the magic has dissipated between the page and the screen.Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone ""Mrs. Doubtfire) writer Steve Kloves (""Wonder Boys ""The Fabulous Baker Boys) and producer David Heyman (""Ravenous) have stressed that faithfulness to the book was a chief priority and few are likely to complain about the way many of the details have been envisioned or how the characters have been portrayed by the all-British cast.Alan Rickman his voice dripping with congealed acid is a perfect Professor Snape; Robbie Coltrane charmingly captures the intimidating yet sweet nature of 8-foot-tall Hogwarts groundskeeper Hagrid; Maggie Smith is an aptly warm yet stern Professor McGonagall; and Richard Harris brings the right aged twinkle to Hogwarts leader Professor Dumbledore.As for the kids theyre likable and relatively natural and they pretty much do whats asked of them. As Harry Daniel Radcliffe looks the part and communicates a noble sense of decency; Rupert Grint brings the right wisecracking Everyboy flavor to Harrys pal Ron; and Emma Watson though way too cute to play the on-the-page bucktoothed Hermione actually makes the strongest impression of the bunch -- the girl knows how to sell her lines as this bossy teachers pet.The movie also looks great -- except for when it blatantly doesnt. Stuart Craigs production design conveys the fantastic elements of the misty-gothic Hogwarts the bustling Diagon Alley (where wizards go shopping) and the goblin-run Gringotts Bank while making them feel like real places. Costume designer Judianna Makovsky and the make-up artists also deserve kudos for creating a Hagrid worthy of our imaginations and giving those goblins (including one played by Verne ""Mini-Me"" Troyer) such vividly creepy looks.Whats surprising is that for a 100 million-plus movie some of the special effects seem rather shoddy. The Quidditch match -- yes alas theres only one -- should be the movies heart-racing centerpiece like the pod race in ""The Phantom Menace"" but you never lose awareness that youre watching kids on brooms in front of screens. Another clumsy use of screens comes for no apparent reason when Harry Ron and Hermione talk to Hagrid in front of his hut."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""110""gt;The movie also may inspire a case of the CGI blues. The baby dragon and rampaging troll (think Shrek on steroids) are as rubbery as computer-generated beasties usually are and the visual trickery is too apparent for you to feel like the kids and troll really share the same space.But the key issue is where the filmmakers who worked closely with Rowling have directed their emphasis. In trying to capture as much of the plot as possible in the not-too-long 2 1/2-hour length they sacrifice the dry wit of Rowlings prose.The movie doesnt figure out a way to translate the authors wry off-handed observations and doesnt have time for the funny exchanges among the kids; compare the books and movies treatment of the scene in which Harry Ron and Hermione get caught in the Devils Snare plant. Also Dumbledore a genuinely quirky character in the book has become Obi-Wan Kenobe in a wizard hat."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""110""gt;1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job "");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt; Related LinksRelated ArticlesThe spell weakensNovember 15 2002DVD sets spill Harry Potter secretsJuly 6 2007Force meets sorcerers stoneDecember 16 2001If youre a Harry Potter fan youve got gameNovember 14 2002The big Harry dealNovember 13 2001Find More Stories AboutHarry PotterHogwartsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-11-16/entertainment/0111160343_1_hogwarts-harry-potter-professor-snape,200,harrypotterandthesorcerer'sstone28,harrypotterandthesorcerer'sstone,chicagotribune
