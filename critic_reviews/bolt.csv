Directed by newcomers Byron Howard and Chris Williams its a romantic tale of the sentimental education of the titular dog which is graphically inspired by the larger American shepherd and modestly voiced by John Travolta. In Truman Show fashion Bolt is the deluded super-hero star of a hit live-action childrens television show replete with a snazzy lightning logo emblazoned on his flank. As Bolt is separated by accident from his person the equally innocent child-star Penny (Miley Cyrus) and joined by an alley-cat (a sassy touching Susie Essman) and couch-potato Hamster (a cherishable star-turn by animator Mark Walton) he learns to be a real dog.One of the pleasures of Bolt is how without taking itself too seriously it combines adventure with ideas and how the thoughtful sympathetic script has fun with the reality/fantasy divide in a way that makes perfect sense to small kids while still providing engagement and amusement for older siblings and adults in tow. Visually its clever and stimulating there are some excellent eye-level 3D effects a nice pastiche of bullet-time (part of a running theme throughout the film discussing the relationship of live-action to CGI) and - elatingly - a pair of beautiful helicopter shots. Borrowing a practice from Pixar the main feature is prefaced by a short film one of car-dealers son Lasseters own CGI spin-offs from Cars the lovely Japanese-accented Tokyo Mater which charmingly combines petrol-head nostalgia with Speed Racer-esque kineticism.

"Disneys Eager-to-Please Bolt Lives Up to Its Studio Pedigree washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Disneys Eager-to-Please Bolt Lives Up to Its Studio Pedigree PHOTOS Previous          Next Bolts companions on his journey home are Mittens the cat and Rhino the hamster. (Disney Via Associated Press) Bolt and company embark on adventures. (Disney Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Dan Kois Special to The Washington Post Friday November 21 2008 For years now the Walt Disney animation studio has been living a nightmare version of one of its own classic stories. The ugly stepsister to Pixars Cinderella Disney Animation -- the studio behind Cinderella as well as Snow White Bambi and Dumbo -- has watched as younger prettier Pixar stepped into the glass slipper again and again. ""Toy Story"" ""Finding Nemo"" ""Ratatouille"" ""WALL E"" -- Pixars movies represent a run of technical artistic and commercial achievement unheard of in Hollywood. Meanwhile corporate sibling Disney Animation has been releasing such forgettable fare as ""Brother Bear."" So its no surprise that ""Bolt"" the first movie developed and made under the reign of Disney Animations new chief -- Pixar mastermind John Lasseter -- pilfers aspects of the Pixar formula. That it falls short of Pixars lofty heights doesnt mean the attempt isnt worthwhile; indeed ""Bolt"" is the most entertaining and well-crafted Disney Animation movie in years. But it aint Pixar. As sprightly and determined as its lead character ""Bolt"" works hard to be all things to all people with mixed results. The story of a TV-star pooch (voiced by John Travolta) whos accidentally mailed from Los Angeles to New York ""Bolt"" follows our hero (plus a cat and a daft hamster) on his return trip across America in search of his owner and co-star Penny (Miley Cyrus). But because Bolt sheltered by his producers from the outside world believes he truly is the superdog he plays on the tube -- complete with super-bark and heat rays shot from his eyes -- Bolts simple dog-meets-girl girl-loses-dog dog-seeks-girl story jockeys for attention with some fairly sophisticated Hollywood satire complete with a smooth-talking agent and splashy action scenes. The result is a family film with an identity crisis ""The Incredible Journey"" meets ""Entourage"" meets ""The Truman Show."" The movies lovingly animated exploding helicopters -- shown with Michael Bay elan blowing up from three angles -- might terrify the younger children most likely to melt at the scenes of Penny hugging her warm puppy. Meanwhile tweens -- well-versed thanks in part to Cyruss own ""Hannah Montana"" in the ins and outs of stardom -- may bristle at the movies anti-celebrity theme as Penny learns that theres something more important than her career as a child actress in a Hollywood where adults have only the bottom line in mind. At Pixar this kind of tonal blend comes about organically; think of the seamless mix of child-friendly comedy and anti-corporate satire in ""Monsters Inc."" or the way ""Finding Nemo"" so elegantly combined real-life parenting concerns with high-spirited adventure. But ""Bolt"" awkwardly toggles from TV-biz in-jokes to sentimental road trip with the two stories colliding haphazardly at the movies conclusion. Thats not to say that everything ""Bolt"" borrows from Pixar doesnt work. As in a Pixar movie the supporting characters -- voiced not by Hollywood stars but by working actors and moonlighting animators -- steal the show. Bolts partners in his long-distance journey are an alley cat named Mittens voiced with sardonic charm by the comedian Susie Essman and Rhino a hyperventilating hamster played by longtime Disney development artist Mark Walton. Rhino a crazed fanboy whos watched every episode of Bolts TV show from inside his plastic hamster ball is the kind of endearing sidekick whose antics surely have Disney executives already planning his first straight-to-DVD spinoff. And like the best Pixar movies ""Bolt"" is often awe-inspiringly beautiful. Shown in 3-D in some theaters -- viewers will be given Buddy Holly-type glasses for the effect -- the film makes exceptional use of the technique not just for kinetic action but for lovely tableaux of the American countryside through which Bolt and his friends travel. One gorgeous shot of the jewellike taillights of an animal-control van resembled a 21st-century Edward Hopper painting. Its the kind of unexpected detail that makes me hope that Disney Animation unlike the ugly stepsisters in ""Cinderella"" might have a future yet. Bolt (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild action and peril.

Others neednt run. Or walk. ENLARGE Robert Pattinson The bleached-faced bloodsucker Edward Cullen attends high school in Forks a singularly gloomy little town in Washington state; hes played by the young English heartthrob-in-the -making Robert Pattinson. Edward first meets his inamorata Bella (Kristen Stewart) when she moves to Forks where her father is police chief from her mothers house in Phoenix where she had managed fatefully to avoid getting a tan. In a film that has the courage of its absurdity but not much else Mr. Pattinson gets the best of what passes for style. Hes been fitted out with an upswept rats-nest hairdo along with a thin coat of clown-white makeup and photographed with special attention to his cantilevered brows and his gift for growing a gaze into a glare or when the occasion demands it a leer. Ms. Stewart on the other hand hasnt been directed so much as permitted or maybe incited to indicate anxiety by spitting out her lines in a rat-tat-tat that can be borderline unintelligible. ENLARGE Kristen Stewart as Bella left and Robert Pattinson as Edward in Twilight. Summit Entertainment Not that ""Twilights"" fate hangs on intelligibility. It hangs on fangs that arent bared and on a bloodlust that isnt indulged. Edward is as he explains to Bella patiently the vampire equivalent of a vegetarian. Like ordinary people living on tofu he and his family restrict their diet to animal blood though they still consider the human variety a treat to die for. Indeed the movie pushes undead abstinence while its director Catherine Hardwicke indulges in klutzy extravagance that misfires as often as it fires -- a Cullen family baseball game is to howl at -- and gets little blood pounding until the climax when Edward clashes with the slavering scion of a carnivorous vampire family in some no-tofu kung fu for the custody of Bellas soul. ""Twilight"" has targeted the collective soul of teenage America and will surely have its way. Bolt I saw ""Bolt"" Disneys 3-D animated feature about a movie dog who mistakenly thinks he has superpowers only an hour after leaving my own dog Skeezix at a boarding kennel for a weeks stay. Skeezix has no such illusions to protect him -- hes just a lovable little guy who thinks regular dog thoughts -- so my heart was heavy with regret that may have skewed my response to the movie. I did not find ""Bolt"" lovable. Likable yes and occasionally endearing -- yet the best parts involve a hamster in a plastic ball. The movie dogs confusions are entertaining though theyre familiar to anyone who has seen Buzz Lightyear in Pixars peerless ""Toy Story"" films. But the spunk of the hamster a corpulent rodent named Rhino is stirring and theres a timeless purity to the spectacle of him scurrying around in his private little sphere. Taken on its own terms ""Bolt"" the movie certainly makes the cut. In his role as the action hero of a popular TV show Bolt the canine -- a white rescue dog voiced by John Travolta -- is all but omnipotent. (Miley Cyrus provides the voice of his co-star and owner a girl named Penny.) But the mail room accidentally packs him in Styrofoam peanuts and ships him to New York where hes thrown on his own severely limited resources. (The poor pooch doesnt even know how to beg until he gets amusing lessons from a street-smart cat named Mittens.) The plot such as it is has Rhino voiced by Mark Walton and Mittens (Susie Essman) helping Bolt to get back to Hollywood and his beloved Penny and coming to understand that true heroism doesnt depend on special powers. ENLARGE Bolt voiced by John Travolta Walt Disney Studios The 3-D process is an enhancement even though its used with little verve or ingenuity. But the movies terms are severely limited too. ""Bolt"" is yet another entertainment fascinated by the entertainment industry with knowing references to agents writers directors ratings and the like. This wont damage our kiddies delicate minds but it wont fire their imaginations either. Mine was warmed if not fired by simpler things such as Bolt sticking his head out the window of a mobile home in transit and rediscovering the joy of the wind. Let the Right One In By happy happenstance a remarkably fine and genuinely frightening movie about a teenage vampire is playing in a dozen or more cities around the country. ""Let the Right One In"" in Swedish with English subtitles was directed by Tomas Alfredson from John Ajvide Lindqvists adaptation of his own novel. This time the genders are reversed -- the vampire takes the form of a dark-eyed girl. Her name is Eli and she moves into a suburban apartment with a stone-faced man who only looks to be her father. At first Eli has evil eyes for Oskar the boy next door; he looks like an angel and lives in a hell created by school bullies. But she falls in love in her fashion and becomes the boys protector. ENLARGE Kare Hedebrant (center) in Let the Right One In. Magnet Releasing See a scene from Let the Right One In. See a scene from Ballast. Mr. Alfredsons style is as elegant and laconic as ""Twilight"" is amateurish and campy. The cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema has created formal compositions muted in tone that I will savor as still frames when the DVD is released. The film has its share of sly humor. At one point Eli her face smeared with a victims blood snuggles with Oskar in bed and tells him shes not really a girl but he still wants to go steady. Yet the main dramatic tone is quiet horror grounded in a matter-of-factness that will have your blood running cold. Ballast In the recent flood tide of releases I missed another elegantly uncluttered little movie -- little only in the scale of its production budget -- called ""Ballast."" A debut feature by Lance Hammer its a deceptively leisurely account of tragedy and reconciliation in a Mississippi delta family. At the center of it all is Lawrence a large deliberate man played by Micheal J. Smith Sr. (Mr. Hammer has used only nonprofessionals in his cast and used them brilliantly.) When his twin brother kills himself Lawrence grows despondent his nephew goes out of control and the familys already tattered fabric starts to unravel. ENLARGE Micheal J. Smith Sr. in Ballast Alluvial Film Co. That makes the movie sound more eventful than it is. For the most part the story moves at the ambling pace of uncertain lives a pace representing the filmmakers trust that his audience will stay involved as several important events unfold. His trust is justified by his talent. This ostensibly simple film evokes whole lives in 96 minutes and does so with sparse dialogue. Its about sorrow addiction the secret life of a child an incipient fall from the slippery decks of respectability and the moral and material ballast that keeps a family afloat. Its even about twins. The brother who dies takes some of Lawrence with him. DVD TIP Lets be seriously film-scholarly here. Carl Theodor Dreyers ""Vampyr"" (1932) is one of the landmark horror films in film history and it has recently been remastered and released in a Criterion version that does full justice to its visual splendor. ""Vampyr"" is mostly silent and entirely hypnotic. The cinematographer was Rudolph Mate who went on to a long and distinguished career in Hollywood. (He shot ""Gilda"" starring the entirely gorgeous Rita Hayworth.) Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Find TV listings at LocateTV.

(SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 21 2008 Bolt (out of 4) An animated adventure featuring the voices of John Travolta Miley Cyrus Susie Essman and Mark Walton. Directed by Chris Williams and Byron Howard. In 3D at some theatres; check listings. 96 minutes. G The Disney-Pixar canine comedy Bolt is a case of the tail wagging the dog but thats nothing to bark about.The ""tail"" is Pixar the animation upstart with the Midas touch that once exclusively belonged to the ""dog"" Disney Pixars corporate master.Indeed no finer compliment can be paid to Bolt than to say it looks and sounds more like an unheralded Pixar film than just another widget from the Disney factory.A lot of this has to do with executive producer John Lasseter a Pixar co-founder now tasked with animating both companies. This is his first Disney flick from the ground up and his paw prints are everywhere.Mainly theyre seen in regard to the story which in Pixar fashion is brainier than it needs to be for a movie aimed at tots pre-teens and their indulgent parents. Subplots about personal identity (""What do dogs do?"") and reality vs. fantasy make this movie seem at times like a Philosophy 101 course at a very furry university.The offside vocal choices are another tip-off. There are the expected celebrity hires with John Travolta as title pooch Bolt the naive white shepherd with super-sized delusions pop sensation Miley Cyrus as Penny Bolts adoring mistress and Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Calico a creepy villain.But other voices are straight out of left kennel. Susie Essman who plays the foul-mouthed Susie Greene in TVs Curb Your Enthusiasm probably wouldnt have been the late Uncle Walts first choice to play a cat in a kids cartoon. But shes perfect as Mittens the snarky stray who has to teach Bolt how to be a dog.Then theres Mark Walton who is this movies secret weapon. As Rhino a fanboy hamster with his own reality issues Walton provides the most Pixar-like performance of all. Not bad for an old Disney hand whose main gig until now has been as animator and writer (although he did voice Goosey Loosey for Chicken Little). Walton maintains the Pixar tradition of letting technical guys in on the fun as the company did for sound effects ace Ben Burtt for WALL-E.Other Disney veterans also shift roles. Animators Byron Howard and Chris Williams whose previous work includes Chicken Little and Mulan slide into the directors chair for the first time. Williams also shares a co-writer credit with Dan Fogelman (who co-penned Pixars Cars).Back to the story which might be described as The Truman Show meets The Incredible Journey while the 60s-style images are reminiscent of Pixars The Incredibles. Bolt is the star of a weekly TV adventure series sort of like an amped-up version of The Littlest Hobo in which he rescues mistress Penny from all manner of dire circumstances.All involved realize its TV show except for tow-headed Bolt who is too dim even to realize that his distinctive lightning bolt marking (move over Harry Potter) has just been sprayed on.Hes in for a rude shock when a mix-up strands him alone and forlorn in New York City while Penny returns to Hollywood. Bolt is determined to make it home accompanied by Mittens and Rhino but hes going to have to accept his limitations before he realizes his true strengths.""If the dog believes the audience believes"" says the Bolt TV show director voiced by James Lipton. Belief may be in question for much of the movie - only for the perturbed pooch - but fortunately enjoyment is never a problem.

If Lady and the Tramp and 101 Dalmatians cant be numbered among the animation studios most ambitious projects they both had a high satisfaction quotient. No wonder the canine attributes of curiosity affection and unshakable loyalty are an ideal fit for Disney family values of any era. (Cats not so much.) From the live-action pup opera Old Yeller in the 50s to the mixed-media friskiness of this falls Beverly Hills Chihuahua Disney has paraded and profited from its pooch panache. Bolt the first Disney animated feature made under the supervision of Pixar creative boss John Lasseter has a premise straight out of Chihuahua an adorable pampered L.A. dog gets dropped into an alien environment and has to find its way back home learning lessons of friendship confidence and self-reliance en route. (Its also the premise of 140000 other movies about animals kids or hobbits.) Bolt fits this familiar mold without looking moldy. Its visual style is unpretentiously attractive with a limber graphic line and theres little showboating in the design or the dialogue. Directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard are perfectly pleased to have labored in the service of that humblest of genres the dog cartoon. (See TIMEs top 10 dog movies) The story though is high-concept and high-maintenance. In the Bond-worthy opening action scene Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is introduced as a Superdog faster than Speed Racer more powerful than Benji able to hold a dangling car between his teeth plus his gifts of bent-track laser-vision and the amazing thunder bark -- all to help his ""human"" Penny (Miley Cyrus) escape an army of bad guys. He could be the family dog of the Incredibles. What Bolt doesnt know yet is that all this mayhem and all his powers are fake. Hes the star of a TV adventure series and if he werent so focused on his Penny-paving mission he might notice the cameras stunt men and effects technicians. Bolt in other words is a canine Truman Show whose producers think hell give a more intense performance if he thinks its real. Thanks to conniving from the usual slimy coven of agents and network execs -- and a tumble of coincidences nearly as endearing as they are preposterous -- Bolt is shipped to New York City where he strikes up a quick animosity with a sassy cat named Mittens (Curb Your Enthusiasms Susie Essman). Their itinerary will be no secret to the youngest of viewers cat and dog joined by Rhino (Disney animator Mark Walton) a hamster who travels in a Plexiglas ball. Through Rhino a diehard fan of the TV show Bolt realizes that his powers arent so super and he comes to suspect that Penny was just another jaded Hollywood actress whod forget about him when she left the set. There are stretches when the animal trios westward trek packs no more excitement or amusement than a Presidential candidates slog through the prairie-state primaries. Mittens yenta-like attitude can get grating and for a while Rhino is the only character with much wit or verve. But from the moment Bolt sticks his head out the window of a speeding truck and feels the breeze of freedom and free will the picture snaps to life and instantly acquires heart (Lasseters favorite movie organ). Of course each character gets to show a heroism all the more special for being displayed without special effects. Indeed Rhinos climactic declaration of purpose -- that ""All my dreaming has prepared me for this moment"" -- might be the motto not just of this very satisfying film but of the Disney-Pixar animators. Theyre smart kids who dream for a living. Its a satisfaction of another sort to have movies that appeal to the deepest dreamiest parts of a tyro moviegoers soul. In the pre-Thanksgiving lull parents can take their younguns to Bolt drop their 10-to-14-year-olds off at Twilight and the whole family will have survived the weekend. All it takes is a handsome vampires bite and a cute dogs bark.

Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 An image from Disneys latest animated film ""BOLT."" An image from Disneys latest animated film ""BOLT."" Photo Disney Enterprises Inc. Movie review Bolt a jolt of fun 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Bolt Animated feature. Voiced by John Travolta Miley Cyrus Susie Essman and Mark Walton. Directed by Byron Howard and Chris Williams (PG. 81 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Bolt"" begins with a noisy chase scene. Big bruisers who resemble refugees from the Clone Wars are after a young girl and her pooch. The motley crew comes at you in 3-D. Bam Kabam At this point you might wonder ""Are major ballistics really necessary in an animated kiddie flick?"" Not to worry. Like an agitated puppy ""Bolt"" soon darts off in another direction. The only word for where it goes is ingenious. The pooch - a white German shepherd answering to the name Bolt and voiced with warmth and emotion by John Travolta - is the star of a hit TV series in which he rescues his young owner Penny week after week. The shows producers keep Bolt in the dark about his celebrity status so his emotions and facial expressions will appear real. They want him to believe hes really capable of flying and running fast enough to keep up with a vehicle. Bolt is kept in character by containing him in a trailer on the set between episodes. Hes a method actor who doesnt realize he is acting. ""Bolt"" is the first Disney animated feature made under the supervision of Pixars creative guru John Lasseter. Although it doesnt reach the heights of ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles"" its a masterpiece compared with Disneys 2002 ""Treasure Island."" The house of mouse obviously has been all ears to what young audiences expect in animation. ""Bolt"" comes close to the perfect mix of entrancing kids while throwing the occasional bone to their adult companions who will see the parallels between ""Bolt"" and ""The Truman Show"" and recognize that Pennys sleazebag of an agent would fit right in on ""Entourage."" When Bolt disappears the agent tries to assuage his client with a substitute as if a beloved pet could ever be replaced even by an exact replica. The real Bolt has accidentally slipped into a freight box and been driven across country doing battle with Styrofoam packing which he blames for his diminished powers. Theres a magical scene of him emerging at Times Square just another awed tourist. The Broadway and 42nd Street signs leap out at those who havent tired of wearing 3-D glasses. Disney calls its system Digital 3-D to distinguish it from the schlocky 3-D of yore. Its not as in your face but offers a consistency the old system lacked. In Bolts first encounter with the canine world a dachshund sniffs his butt and Bolt finds this unpleasant to say the least. A fussy cat named Mittens who runs a kind of Mafia operation insisting on her share of all the other animals grub attaches herself to Bolt sensing there is something in it for her. Theyre soon joined by a hamster called Rhino who hangs out in trailer parks eating scraps and watching TV. Rhino immediately recognizes Bolt and goes bonkers at being in his exalted presence. On their travels they meet more of Bolts fans in the animal kingdom who feel indebted to the top dog for making them feel powerful. The interaction among Bolt Rhino and Mittens is poignant as well as cute. She claims to be an alley cat but soon confides a sad story of being deserted by her owners. No wonder she is so terrified of an animal-shelter truck cruising by. Like the gang from Oz this trio has an objective to find Penny and return Bolt to TV fame. Disney didnt drop a lot of money on celebrities to voice these parts. Travolta and Cyrus as Penny are the only star names. Smart thinking. Its doubtful that audiences go to animated features to hear movie stars talk. They go because a film sounds like fun and something their kids and maybe they themselves might enjoy. ""Bolt"" is all that and more. -- Advisory Mildly scary situations.

"Movie review Bolt -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Bolt -- 4 out of 5 stars Bolt (voice of John Travolta) is a star of a hit TV show but when he is accidentally shipped from Hollywood to New York City he travels through the real world to get back to his owner and co-star Penny (voice of Miley Cyrus) armed only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are real and the help of two unlikely traveling companions. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Disney animation takes a tentative step out of the shadows of Pixar with Bolt a winning 3D-animated action-comedy that marries the best Disney traditions with Pixar polish. Though this road comedy of a lost TV star dog doesnt rival the classics from Disneys computer-animation pioneer partners its the first in-house Disney animation -- after the middling Chicken Little The Wild and Meet the Robinsons -- to bear comparison to the Pixar gold standard.In a dazzling 10-minute opening were treated to a sort of Bolt Supremacy the adventures of a teenage girl and her ""genetically altered"" super dog a canine capable of leaping over black helicopters in a single bound blowing up objects with his glower and flattening armies with his ""super bark."" Whenever Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) is in danger Bolt is there to save her.But Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) isnt in on the gag. The effects go off around him and he thinks he did it. The bars on a prison cell bend because theyre rubber and he doesnt know. Its all to preserve Bolts delusional sense of urgency the shows director (James Lipton of Inside the Actors Studio) insists. So Bolt is particularly ill-suited to be on his own. When hes accidentally shipped to New York he has to make his way back to Hollywood and Penny using not his vaunted super powers but his wit his slow realization that hes not the dog he always thought he was.""Normally Im a tad more indestructible"" he complains to the cat he kidnaps because he thinks cats are part of the vast feline conspiracy of ""the green-eyed man"" the TV shows villain. Mittens (Susie Essman) has the thankless job of bringing the super dog back to Earth of explaining to him the ways of the world of convincing him that no Styrofoam packing peanuts arent what robbed him of his powers.She has to because the other sidekick they pick up along the way is a fat furry fanboy in hamster form -- Rhino. He travels in a hamster ball and just loves Bolt on the ""magic box"" (TV) and hes just as delusional about their ""mission"" as the dog.""I eat danger for breakfast "" The 3D animation here is less gimmicky than is usual for movies that you have to watch through the funny glasses. It just makes the images sharper.Bolt may be more verbal than your typical Disney toon but its a comedy with the patience to let a slow-burn gag pay off. A bit involving a flock of pigeons with Jersey accents pigeons who cant quite place the TV star plays out in pigeon-time.""Yo take it easy.""""I will not take it easy pheasant""But its not just about the laughs. Its a cartoon that goes to great pains to mimic and mock real dog behavior much of which Mittens has to teach Bolt whos never had to beg with those puppy dog eyes. Its about a girl who loves her dog and the dog who loves her back. And that heart makes Bolt the best Disney cartoon to not have the Pixar name on it since Lilo amp; Stitch.

Sporadically entertaining occasionally quite funny and presented in unremarkable 3-D in some theaters (like last years ""Meet the Robinsons"") this new film shows evidence of considerable tweaking under the supervision of Pixar. But overall its basically a crass marketing concept closer to ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" than a fully conceived work of art like ""Wall-E."" Young children will probably respond most enthusiastically to the generic story line in the vein of ""The Incredible Journey"" and so many other Disney epics. It follows a mutt named Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) as he travels across the United States in search of his mistress Penny (Disney franchise Miley Cyrus) who he thinks is in danger from a British bad guy (Malcolm McDowell). Where the film fails conspicuously is in the attempt to give this basic idea a Charlie Kaufman-esque twist to appeal to adults. Bolt stars with Penny in a TV show and thinks he actually has his characters super power - until circumstances remove him from the soundstage trailer where he spends his time when he isnt before the cameras. But directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard (and screenwriters Williams and Dan Fogelman) cant even make up their minds whether the show is filmed in San Francisco (which the opening sequence would seem to indicate) or in Los Angeles (where the film concludes with a seemingly endless fire sequence). Why would Bolt even think he has the power to wreak havoc with his growl when the effects would presumably be added in post-production? Why isnt he suspicious that he never spends any time with Penny whos actually an actress off the set? These and many questions go unanswered as the filmmakers rely on many subsidiary characters an overbearing agent a motormouth hamster pigeons with New Yawk accents and funniest screenwriting birds pitching a script. Theyre there to relieve the basic tedium of the personality-free Bolt and Penny - voiced without much distinction by Travolta and Cyrus - and an increasingly super-predictable plot. Susie Essman of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" adds a dash of vinegar as the voice of Mittens a sassy cat who joins Bolt along the way and teaches him how to act like a ""real"" dog. ""Bolt"" will make a mint but I couldnt help agreeing with Mittens when she complains ""This is becoming tiresome. I feel a yawn coming on."" lou.lumenicknypost.comBOLT Who let this dog out? Running time 96 minutes. Rated PG (mild action peril). At the Empire the Union Square the First and 62nd others.

Joe Neumaier Thursday November 20 2008 655 PM Disney animation has been let off the leash with ""Bolt"" and proves that even those whove led know when to follow. In this case its Pixar which uses the Mouse House as its distributor whose footsteps are the guide and whose visual precision is copied down to a dogs hair though the heart of Pixars simple stories - their gentleness - is missing.After the snow-white pooch Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is adopted by sweet-but-tough Penny (Miley Cyrus) hes genetically ""altered"" in a science experiment - or so he thinks. Hey its plausible since every day Bolt and Penny have hair-raising adventures as they fight the evil Dr. Calico using Bolts glass-shattering super-bark and laser-beam eyesight. But as Bolt finds when he escapes his trailer one day thats all make-believe a canine version of ""The Truman Show."" Bolt is just a normal dog but he believes hes the character he plays on TV. Accidentally shipped to New York he sets out to find Penny aided by the cynical city cat Mittens (Susie Essman). And just as Bolt realizes he lacks special powers he meets Rhino a hilarious TV-addicted helium-voiced hamster in a wheel who never doubts Bolts abilities helping the faux-hero hound find real strength inside. Though every frame is great to look at ""Bolts"" script - by the co-writers of ""Mulan"" and ""Cars"" - lacks the wit of its closest Pixar relative ""The Incredibles."" Rhino and some goofy pigeons provide the few laughs once the tale goes cross-country. Plus Pennys heartsickness takes a backseat to the action; were left to wonder if Bolts return will result in something like a contract renewal or 15% for the smarmy agent. That wasnt part of ""The Incredible Journey"" or ""The Aristocats."" Still 10-year-olds are savvy enough about media to appreciate Bolts meta-dilemma (Travoltas earnest vocal performance is spot-on) while parents may wonder when it became okay for childrens movies to include some very harrowing images like a scary fire on a soundstage or giant exploding fireballs. These arent ""Bambis"" forest flames or the fairy-tale traumas of ""Pinocchio"" and ""Sleeping Beauty."" They are ironic for ""Bolt"" rooted in real life - or adult action flicks at least - and trickier to explain to kindergartners who arent schooled in ""Transformers."" That age group may find Pennys collapse from smoke inhalation disturbing. Disney surely sees that inside the kinetic movement of Pixar films is a lot of restraint. ""Bolt"" is super-fast yet not as super-sincere as it would like to believe. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) joins forces with Mittens (Susie Essman) and Rhino (Mark Walton) on a cross-country adventure. Photo Disney/MCT Bolt 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Boltis a small white dog with big delusions. He thinks he can stop a speeding car and dangle its totaled carcass in his teeth. He believes his bark is a weapon of mass destruction. Hes convinced he can outrun motorcycles crash through walls and disintegrate metal with his eyes. ""If I stare at the lock long enough"" he explains ""it will burst into flames and melt."" In short he believes he is a superdog. Granted most German Shepherds do but Bolt (voiced by the ever-puppyish John Travolta) is different. Hes the star of a popular action-packed TV show -- like 24 but woollier -- alongside his 12-year-old owner Penny (teen pop empress Miley Cyrus) whos kidnapped on a weekly basis by a cat-eyed villain with the predatory articulation of Malcolm McDowell. Bolt doesnt know its a TV show. Hes been kept in the dark by a Method-mad director (Inside the Actors Studios James Lipton cute touch) trying to capture authenticity in the face of his canine thespian. Bolt thinks Penny is forever being snatched by a nefarious mastermind and he forever uses his superheroic powers to rescue her from his clutches. Its a living. But this is Disney were talking about so its a safe bet Bolt is about to be separated from the one thing he loves most. This computer-animated (but non-Pixar) adventure flick doesnt do much of anything innovative but it sports a disarming furball of a lead and enough jaunty comic turns to carry the day. Some sections and characters are better animated -- and imagined -- than others and its hard to avoid the let-down when Bolts rip-snorting TV show gives way in the introductory minutes to the less-exciting business of life in the real world. But it zooms along and its good for plenty of chuckles. Boltwas co-helmed byChicken Littleanimator Byron Howard andThe Emperors New Groovewriter Chris Williams from a script by Williams andFred Clausscribe Dan Fogelman. Reportedly it started life as a much quirkier undertaking -- something in there about a radioactive bunny -- in the hands of aLilo amp; Stitch director Chris Sanders. He got the boot with regime change at Disney and the movie became a squishier parable of heroism about a dog with a lightning bolt painted on his fur. The bolt fades along with the rest of Bolts elaborately constructed illusion when the little feller slips out of Pennys trailer and winds up getting shipped to New York City in a box with Styrofoam packing peanuts. When he emerges he is shocked shocked to learn that his powers no longer work and he assumes those nasty pink peanuts are the culprit. They must have weakened him somehow. Why else would his karate chops fail to KO a guy reading the New Yorker on a bench? Why else cant he crash his head through an iron-wrought fence? His noggin stuck he draws the attention of three amusingly animated pigeons with toughie New Yawk accents -- watching their heads tic and bob is one of the films weirder treats -- who then bring him to a sourpuss alley cat named Mittens (Curb Your Enthusiasms Susie Essman). Bolt thinking Mittens is the enemy ties her up and demands to be taken to Penny. Mittens thinking Bolt is nuts makes the cross-country trek while instructing him in the art of normal doggy behavior -- such as begging drinking from toilets and sticking his head out of moving vehicles. This is fun stuff but the best arrives in the blobby form of Rhino (voiced by Mark Walton Chicken Littles Goosey Loosey) a corpulent hamster who rolls around in a plastic ball. He has in his own way even bigger delusions than Bolt and he is grandly idiotic in their pursuit. Hes the best thing in the movie paws down. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Unlocked Smartphones at eBay Up to 88% off from 26 + free...

Comments Bolt Disney CGI animation about a canine TV star (given voice by John Travolta) who gets separated from his little-girl owner (Miley Cyrus) and must find his way home assisted by a cynical alley cat and a wisecracking hamster in a plastic globe. The movie recycles story elements from kids movies both recent (the 2007 turkey Firehouse Dog about a lost celebrity pooch) and ancient (Disneys 1963 live-action adventure The Incredible Journey about a trio of animals on the road). Adults wont find much to enjoy here though the dogs high-octane action series serves as a perverse parody of Jerry Bruckheimer-style summer blockbusters. Byron Howard and Chris Williams directed.

"Putting on the dog in Bolt - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Bolt Putting on the dog in Bolt Bolt (with Rhino a hamster in a plastic ball) is the star of a hit TV show. By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / November 21 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Movies in 3D are usually best at goosing you into spilling your soft drink. But ""Bolt"" a new animated adventure from Disney presented at some locations in 3D does more than put fireballs and runaway props right on the bridge of your nose. The format brilliantly brings an audience that much closer to a handful of increasingly lonely yet contagiously enthusiastic animals.Bolt (adorably voiced by John Travolta) is a white German shepherd whos the eponymous star of a hit TV show about a superdog and his spunky owner. (It looks like ""MacGyver"" and ""Inspector Gadget"" pressed into a rather dull video game.)The joke is that Bolt believes the show is real. Its pretentious director (James Lipton outside the Actors Studio) insists thats what ensures an authentic performance every week so the Hollywood production has to maintain the illusion. That includes the two cats who play the evil villains feline accessories and show up at Bolts trailer to mock their naive costar.The ruse dismays the shows child star Penny (Miley Cyrus). All she wants is to take Bolt home which of course would be a violation of the ""Truman Show""-like conceit.This stuff is clever in the reflexively satirical self-aware way that many animated films are. Its not until the dog is accidentally shipped off to New York City that the movie lets you in on an altogether more interesting idea It doesnt want to be that cool. In New York Bolt discovers that his ""superbark"" (trademarked Im sure) no longer supersonically mows down entire armies and that his shoulder chop doesnt really knock people out. Hes just a dog but one who still believes his fictional owner is in trouble.Eventually Bolt is drawn into the company of a perilously thin cat named Mittens (Susie Essman) and Rhino an obese scene-stealing hamster in a plastic ball (Mark Walton) who recognizes Bolt from ""the magic box"" and is thrilled beyond words to join the rescue mission back to Los Angeles. The movie which was written by Dan Fogelman and the co-director Chris Williams seamlessly combines its action duties (always be moving) with its emotional inclinations (always be feeling). So you understand that each time Mittens has to tell her new friend that he is destructible it hurts her that much more.If youve ever seen Essman as Jeff Garlins obscenely abusive wife on HBOs ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" it seems unfathomable that shed be hired to provide the kind of patient support called for here (were Amy Adams or Renee Zellweger unavailable?). But Essman proves as capable a friend as she does a frenemy on HBO never more so than when Mittens exposes Bolt to the joys of being a dog - his tongue wagging from the side of a moving vehicle is a highlight.The road trip back to Hollywood allows the dog the cat and the hamster to see America and the montage that takes them west is a heart-soaring sequence set to a ""This Land Is Your Land"" country-gospel song about homesickness sung by Jenny Lewis. Not much later theres a funny pair of droll pigeons and a climactic inferno that evokes the wildfires still burning in Southern California.But that song still played on a loop in my head. Its part of the movies resounding suggestion that the Hollywood entertainment factory can be an exploitative kind of Oz and that animals even chatty Disney ones are happiest when theyre chasing sticks.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

""Bolt"" is a jolt of joy a computer-animated delight that is delirious with laughs. Its also canny enough to know that perilous suspense and even sad moments have a place in any good childrens story. This Disney feature executive-produced by Pixar genius John Lasseter has all the hallmarks of his earlier classics adorable characters clever humor thrilling action and heartfelt emotion. Its the best Disney film since the glory days of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and the first 3-D production Ive seen that will have kids and grownups alike misting up their stereoscopic shades. The films premise has already been revealed in the studios publicity campaign but its so cleverly presented onscreen that it would be a shame to spoil the surprise for those who have missed it. The bare bones are that Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is a gallant lovable dog who is separated from his 12-year-old human Penny (Disney pop princess Miley Cyrus) and travels cross-country to rejoin her accompanied by a cynical cat Mittens (Susie Essman) and Rhino a hyper-enthusiastic hamster (Mark Walton) in a plastic rolling ball. The pampered pooch learns important lessons about love humility and faith along the way. If youre unaware of the storys big surprise please stop reading now go see the movie and come back to the rest of this review afterward. Youll thank me. Go on now. Welcome back. Wasnt that a treat? ""Bolt"" is a normal dog who has been raised on the set of a TV action series. Each week he and Penny battle the evil legions of Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell) who inevitably crumble before Bolts genetically engineered super strength heat vision and sonic-boom bark. This setup kicks off the story with a stupendously exciting pursuit scene thats far wittier and more engrossing than the visually dyslexic action scenes in the new Bond movie. Disney Star Tribune The bare bones are that Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) is a gallant lovable dog who is separated from his 12-year-old human Penny (Disney pop princess Miley Cyrus) and travels cross-country to rejoin her accompanied by a cynical cat Mittens (Susie Essman) and Rhino a hyper-enthusiastic hamster (Mark Walton) in a plastic rolling ball. What Bolt doesnt realize is that his adventures are an elaborate special-effects charade. Hes filmed in secret by a realism-freak director (James Lipton) convinced that Bolt will be believable in his heroic role only if he believes the fantasy himself. Penny would love to bring the dog home with her for a nice normal weekend of chase-the-stick but her Hollywood employers wont hear of it. Bolt convinced that the shows fictional villains have Penny in their clutches slips out of his cage and into the first real adventure of his life. Shipped to New York he gets a taste of life on the mean streets without the superpowers he has always relied on to get him out of a jam. The warm heart of ""Bolt"" is a coming-of-age story. The trip west is a wonderfully silly adventure as Bolt deals with the regret of shedding his illusions but learns that just as himself hes capable of heroic deeds. The dogs expressions are heart-rending as well as hilarious and Travoltas vocal performance is utterly winning. A word about the animation. Disney reportedly developed new CGI techniques specifically for this film. I believe it. There are episodes along the animals trek and in the end credits that employ 3D effects unlike anything Ive seen creating stylized artistic images far removed from photorealism. Some look hand-painted while others resemble paper cut-outs. Best of all the animators dont overuse their new capabilities. Theres a great throwaway gag near the finale that spoofs ""Beowulf"" and other 3D films that poke sharp objects at viewers in hopes of making us duck. ""Bolt"" has the confidence to use its magical effects sparingly never as a substitute for imagination and vitality. What could have been a passable kiddie sedative is instead something lively and memorable. Lassie would be proud.

ABOUT THE MOVIEBolt 1/2 (out of four)Voices John Travolta Miley Cyrus Susie Essman Mark Walton Greg Germann Malcolm McDowellDirectors Byron Howard and Chris Williams Distributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG for some mild action and perilRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Bolt is an action hero who firmly believes he possesses superpowers. Sounds like a spoof on the life of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Actually Bolt is a friendly dog whose entire life has been spent as the heroic star of a popular television show. An enjoyable animated family film Bolt features some engaging 3-D sequences and distinctly lump-in-the-throat moments for dog lovers. The lop-eared canine is likably voiced by John Travolta. Bolts beloved ""person"" is young Penny who has the chirpy voice of Miley Cyrus. The furry Bolt spends most of his waking hours fighting peril. If he bores his eyes into something it explodes. With just a few flicks of his paw he can bend steel bars and flip trucks off the highway. It hasnt exactly gone to his head so much as convince him that he can perform all manner of exploits. What does a pup know from special effects and CGI anyway? He may take his skills for granted but like any good dog he is most passionate about Penny. Though shes an actor too Bolt believes he is her faithful companion and protector. In reality hes a performer who belongs to the studio producing the show. When suddenly Bolt cant be found Penny is inconsolable. Her smarmy agent (Greg Germann) tries to distract her with offers of late-night TV appearances and fashion layouts. Meanwhile Bolt accidentally is packed away and shipped across the country. He roams the streets of New York City undetected (despite giant billboards with his face plastered on them). Certain that his new surroundings bear the stamp of his TV nemesis Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell) Bolt fears Penny is in danger. Hellbent on saving her he teams up with an unlikely pair of domesticated animals. Mittens (Susie Essman) is a snarky alley cat and the chubby Rhino (Mark Walton) is a hamster who is worshipful of Bolt. Bolt borrows amiably from a host of sources including The Incredible Journey Lilo and Stitch and Toy Story 2. But the movie redeems its obvious cribbing by artfully blending exciting action with a comical road-trip saga and imbuing it with a dogged sweetness. Funny and heartwarming if not entirely original Bolt is bound to charm audiences of all ages.

While this charmer about a canine James Bond does not pack the emotional punch of WALL-E its frisky fun to see the white shepherd get a new leash on life. The twist Bolt (voice of John Travolta) thinks hes a super-pooch. But he only plays one on TV. His sonic-boom bark and supersonic speed are the products of Hollywood special-effects wizards. Like Jim Carrey in The Truman Show the pup is not in on the secret that what he calls life is mindless entertainment for the masses. During the films opening set piece a high-speed fetch sequence on photorealistic streets and bridges of San Francisco Bolt thinks that he is saving his ""person"" Penny (voice of Miley Cyrus) from the forces that have kidnapped her father. Only when the trick-dog escapes his crate falls into a packing box and gets overnighted from Television City to New Yorks Times Square does he learn that hes ordinary - possessed of the extraordinary loyalty of his species. In other words the action show Bolt thought was his life turns into reality television. While the showbiz jokes may be too inside-Hollywood for the youngest members of the films target audience those 5-year-olds will relate to Bolts separation anxiety homesickness and drive to find Penny. And almost as much as they love Bolt they will love his sidekicks Mittens an alley-wise cat (Susie Essman) and Rhino a pudgy hamster fanboy who travels in an exercise ball (Mark Walton). By railcar and flatbed truck Mittens and Rhino accompany Bolt on his way back home. The pictorial work here is dazzling. From the fluff of Bolts fur to the cool solidity of the steel bars on his crate to the crumbly warmth of the asphalt on the streets the film has a reach-out-and-touch texture. (I saw it in 3-D which no doubt amped up these details.) As the nasal jaded Mittens and the hyperactive Rhino Essman and Walton supply voice work as nuanced and lively as the images something that cannot be said for Travolta and Cyrus. Any actor who provides a voice in an animated movie should be required to study Tom Hanks and Tim Allen in the Toy Story films and Drew Barrymore and George Lopez in Beverly Hills Chihuahua.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Its a fish-out-of-water story if the fish were a dog actor raised to believe hes a superhero who finds himself suddenly without his powers and the water were the route from New York to Los Angeles that hes forced to travel. John Travolta gives a nice vocal performance as the dog of the title Miley Cyrus does the same as Bolts co-star (the two sing a duet over the closing credits) and Mark Walton provides a lot of laughs as Rhino a TV-obsessed overweight hamster (one probably has something to do with the other). The story is somewhat predictable but its sweet and happy and the animation is first-rate. Its the first feature since Pixar genius-in-residence John Lasseter took over the creative doings at Disney Animation and although it works on a kid level it doesnt offer the layers of enjoyment and wonder that Pixars best offer. Still its no bowser. Plucked from a pet store early in puppyhood to star in a television series Bolt has never left the studio. His minders taking Method acting to the extreme never allow him to break character - the movie begins with a scene from the show with Penny (Cyrus) in peril. Bolt saves her thanks to the special-effects crew but he doesnt know that. And when a studio suit demands ratings stunts like cliffhanger endings leaving Penny in peril at the end of the day Bolt is beside himself thinking she really is in trouble. Breaking free of his trailer Bolt accidentally is shipped to New York. To his dismay his ""powers"" are useless. Believing the evil Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell) from the show is behind all this Bolt seeks help. He finds it in Mittens (Susie Essman) a streetwise former house cat who knows Bolt is just an actor. Bolt for his part thinks shes part of the plot against him but of course the two begin to bond. They figure out that they have to get back to Los Angeles to find and save Penny. Thus begins a road trip that takes up most of the movie Bolt and Mittens bantering back and forth. They pick up Rhino along the way. Its typical buddy-movie stuff nothing more though it looks great and Rhino - as delusional as Bolt about the superhero business - often is really funny. Bolt as you would imagine must come to terms with the truth - that hes ""just"" a dog. Will that be enough to save Penny? Cmon. Its Disney. Did you expect him to roll over and play dead?

Thats not a failure of craft Goofy and sweet like his voicer John Travolta (though mercifully unaffiliated with strange churches) Bolt is both a regular hound and a celebrity pooch the co-star of a pointedly surreal action-adventure television series whose production designer appears to be going through a Fritz Lang period. At the sound of ""Fetch"" Bolt will with his snout overturn speeding cars outrun aircraft that look like giant mosquitoes and face down the cat-loving bad guy Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell) all for the higher good of protecting his ""person"" Penny (Miley Cyrus) a mildly funky nymph fully equipped with the habitual spunk of a Disney New Feminist. Egged on by a manic Director (sonorously voiced by Inside the Actors Studio host James Lipton) with auteur blow-dried into his big hair the loyal little canine firmly believes that his special powers are real -- until a packing accident on the studio lot results in his being shipped off in pink styrofoam to New York City where reality awaits by the shovelful.Poor Bolt Not only must he outperform Twilight at the box office this weekend but hes also tasked with reminding the tots whom the Walt Disney Company has bombarded with showy heroics and whizz-bang effects (or at least their worrywart parents seeking positive values) that ordinary goodness will do just as well if not better. Its no accident that Pennys mom (Grey Delisle) is plump and maternal and the caring antithesis of a stage mother. Like every other kids movie coming off the line these days Bolt carries two tales for the price of one both handled by Disney veterans and first-time directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard with wit grace and the dazzling craftsmanship weve come to expect from the studio thats hitched its wagon to Pixar. One is a sweetly naturalistic road movie for little kids in which Bolt anxious to get back to Hollywood to watch over Penny rides the rails of Americas heartland learning how to be Everydog under the tutelage of the world-weary cat Mittens (voiced by Susie Essman who plays Jeff Garlins implacable wife on televisions Curb Your Enthusiasm) and a fan-boy hamster (Mark Walton) both of whom all but walk away with the movie.Real trumps surreal Bolt gets to experience hunger loneliness the pain of realizing that his lightning bolt smudges in the rain the consoling pleasures of friendship and the knowledge that you dont have to jump through hoops to be a hero. This is standard studio stuff along with the durable fantasy that the good life dwells not on either glitzy coast but in the great Middle American mass airbrushed of its supermalls and commercial strips and filled with rolling fields and welcoming RVs laden with scraps for hungry itinerant dogs. Only Brad Bird with The Incredibles and Ratatouille has separated himself from the kid-movie cult of ordinariness and conformity to celebrate ambition and standing out in the crowd.Is it hypocritical that the grown-up story embedded in Bolt is a deft if hardly original skewering of Hollywood duplicity featuring a ratings-obsessed network harridan an agent (Greg Germann) whos drawn like an albino Michael Tolkin and will do anything to keep Penny happy and working so he can pocket his percentage as well as some well-upholstered pigeons obsessively pushing story ideas? As I laughed my head off I wondered what it means that childrens movies have become the playground for Hollywoods self-loathing. Yet the self-mockery in Bolt is gentle and affectionate and theres something touching about the yearning for ordinary life and decency that to judge by its ubiquity in films for the nominally innocent plagues those who live and work in the realms of the unreal.BOLT | Directed by CHRIS WILLIAMS and BYRON HOWARD | Written by WILLIAMS and DAN FOGELMAN | Produced by CLARK SPENCER | Released by Walt Disney Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

But in Bolt -- a blithe digitally animated (and in select theaters 3-D) doggy comedy as zippy as its name?the fanciful premise only paws the surface of whats going on as we sit in the dark wearing plastic 3-D glasses. The basic story bears the distinctive DNA of the Disney family of dramas. Bolt?s a spunky white shepherd voiced by -- look whos talking -- John Travolta. He lives 24/7 on a Hollywood soundstage that he thinks is the whole wide world -- his own canine Truman Show -- until hes accidentally separated from his ""person"" and TV costar Penny (Miley Cyrus) and shipped in a cargo crate to New York City. Of course imaginary superpowers dont count for much in such a sleepless city of caffeinated mortal go-getters. But never mind. The dog sticks to his belief in his canine invincibility -- and in the constancy of his person wherever she is. (Pennys got a smarmy agent voiced by Greg Germann whos just so annoyingly...agenty as he urges her to forget about her missing costar.) Bolt remains loyal even when hassled by Mittens a skinny wiseacre New York alley cat who couldnt have found a more perfect mouthpiece than the one supplied by Susie Essman the sharp-tongued comedian who berated Larry David so bawdily on Curb Your Enthusiasm. Naturally Essman plays PG-feisty rather than foulmouthed here. But she projects just the right hiss of mischief. When Bolt believes that Styrofoam packing material is his kryptonite -- a mystery element that weakens him -- Mittens cleverly endorses the lie. Well what with one thing and another Mittens joins Bolts cross-country trip to get back to Penny and the city of valet parking. And along the duos hitchhiking route they meet up in an RV park with Rhino (Mark Walton) a hamster who giddy pop culture addict that he is recognizes Bolt as his favorite TV celebrity. Rhino throws himself into the mission (rolls himself actually in his Plexiglas exercise ball) with the gallant geek bravado that is the mark of a superfan. Soon the three amigos are off off on a classic obstacle-strewn personal-growth adventure involving funny mishaps demonstrations of individual heroism scary scrapes (that even at their scariest carry the assurance that things will turn out all right) episodes of losing hope examples of regaining determination instances of heartwarming reunion (oops did I give something away?) and moments involving other funny talking wildlife that make cameo appearances. The New York pigeons are particular pips; maybe theyre related to the flock that helped Amy Adams Giselle in Enchanted? Thats the blueprint. But Bolt impresses on more levels than just the basic -- and in our wised-up self-reflexive pop culture universe audiences are primed to play along with the movies sophisticated meta references to Hollywood culture New York culture TV culture and even doggy culture Look Its a joke about Finding Nemo about Hollywood agents about pitching screenplay ideas (The bright script is by Dan Fogelman and Chris Williams the sleek direction by Disney pros Williams and Byron Howard.) In our 21st-century familiarity with the results we dont give the intricate technobeauty of digital 3-D animation a second thought taking for granted the subtleties of dimension perspective texture and motion that can be achieved (with the right computer programs); on a regular old night at the movies we dont blink twice at seeing the most gorgeous visual shifts and adjustments delicate and thoughtful as an old masters brushstrokes. Theres a stunning throwaway moment when Rhino the hamster rolls in his stupid plastic ball in front of his new compatriots and the faces of dog and cat seen through the plastic are distorted as they would be in real life -- yet we pay no attention to the army of animation artists marshaled just for that one passing sequence. Bolt breaks no great new stylistic ground -- and yet its a sturdy beaut. The cartoon chase scenes are of secondary importance -- and yet theyre wittier and more exciting than anything in Quantum of Solace. Its a great day in America when the complicated looks so easy and when we expect smart storytelling as a rule not the exception.

Plus Disneys huggably meta kids flick Bolt. By David Edelstein Published Nov 16 2008 ShareThis Illustration by Rodrigo Corral  (Photo Ishika Mohan/Courtesy of Fox Searchlight) Its funny how Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in all its languages and cultures gets filmmakers juices flowing. In the climax of Patrice Lecontes My Best Friend the phone a friend lifeline provides the forum for a heart-tugging reconciliation made even sweeter by the ensuing shower of money. Danny Boyles galvanic coming-of-age saga Slumdog Millionaire uses the Hindi version of the show as the films spine its means of recounting a Muslim orphans harrowing life in thousand- ten-thousand- and finally million-rupee junctures. Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy borrows the premise (but few specifics) from the novel Q amp; A by Vikas Swarup Jamal (Dev Patel) wins millions and is promptly arrested on the grounds that an ignorant slumdog who serves chai to better-paid workers must somehow have cheated. Via flashbacks Jamal explains to a cop (Irrfan Khan) how he knew the correct answershow each question as if by fate tied in with some major event in his tragic life. But can even the god of fate triumph over the evil embodied by Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? See Also Why Slumdog Could be 2008s Best Picture Boyle is a smashing directorliterally. He smash-cuts from shot to shot scene to scene chase to chase. He leaps back and forth between Jamal in the game-show hot seat and Jamal in a different kind of hot seat getting jolts of electricity from a fat interrogator Final answer? Zap slap dunk. Final answer. Hes a sensationalist and I dont completely trust him. Slickness and brutality are too inextricable. But at what he does hes a wizard; hes the best there is at a kind of hyperkinetic every-shot-a-grabber filmmaking that many attempt and few bring off. Even with all the blurry-focus tricks and canted angles the action is fluid the momentum headlong. Slumdog Millionaire is his liveliest fusion of style and content since Trainspotting. Like the hero of that movie Jamal is always running for his life. When hes little and his older brother Salim locks him in an outdoor latrine as his favorite Bollywood star arrives in their district he tunnels through a pit of excrement and dashesa mushy brown blobfor his heros autograph. He and his brother run from Hindis on an anti-Muslim rampage then flee a despicable Fagin-like boss whose cruelty toward them is breathtaking. I get the feeling that when Action is called on a Danny Boyle movie the metronome is ticking and the actors have to register emotion fast. But the child performers are enormously affecting; their eyes signal anguish while their bodies fly. As each flashback ends theres a corresponding game-show question posed by the condescending emcee (the splendidly smarmy Anil Kapoor). The man is the very devil but Jamal has a goal that transcends filthy lucre winning the love of Latika a girl who escaped his village after her family was killed and whom he and his brother liberated from prostitution. Now shes kept by an abusive gangster. In her mature incarnation Latika is played by Freida Pinto and is impossibly model-gorgeous and Slumdog Millionaire turns more floridly corny and movie-ish. But Boyle and his Indian co-director Loveleen Tandan have something up their sleeves the allure of the Bollywood universe. Colors pop out music swells morally ambivalent characters atone and bad guys get theirs. The movie even ends with a big production number a song and dance featuring the grown-up leads along with the kids who played them in earlier scenes. The subtext is ingenious The mocking god of the tacky-grandiose Who Wants to Be a Millionaire has been kicked offscreen by the romantic god of Bollywood. The whole thing is irresistibly preposterous. The Disney animated blockbuster-to-be Bolt is a delightful family movie and if Id seen it as a kid I would have been deeply traumatized. Back then kid flicks werent meta; they didnt riff on the discontinuity between real life and the artificial universe of TV and movies. They were plain-old fairy tales parables of self-reliance. Bolt opens with a little girl Penny choosing an adorable doggy at a pet shop. So far so standard. (If you dont want to know the basic premise stop here.) Then it jumps to the next fantastical level Its five years later Pennys scientist father is in the clutches of a megalomaniac and Bolt is equipped with superpowers to protect his daughter. Cue a rollicking chase and the pulverization of bad guys. Just as weve absorbed all this were on to level three. Weve been watching the filming of a TV show except (and heres the final level) Bolt has been kept in a state of ignorance. He does not know hes not a super-dog and that Penny is never in peril. Yes this is The Truman Show with talking animals. 1 2 Next Share this story...

The first inhouse feature from Disney Animation since Pixar guru John Lasseter took over the studios creative reins this tale of a canine forced to overcome his superdog complex and learn to become a regular pooch bears some telltale signs of Pixars trademark smarts but still looks like a mutt compared to the younger companys customary purebreds.

An ""Incredible Journey"" or ""Homeward Bound"" updated for the superhero era ""Bolt"" is an OK Disney animated entry enhanced by nifty 3-D projection. The first inhouse feature from Disney Animation since Pixar guru John Lasseter took over the studios creative reins this tale of a canine forced to overcome his superdog complex and learn to become a regular pooch bears some telltale signs of Pixars trademark smarts but still looks like a mutt compared to the younger companys customary purebreds. While punchy enough to keep parents amused pic will probably play best to small fry and especially with Disney star Miley Cyrus onboard will have no trouble chasing down hefty biz through the holidays. Although it seems like a workable notion on paper onscreen the fundamental premise feels a bit shaky. From puppyhood Bolt (voiced by John Travolta) a white hound with a black lightning bolt emblazoned on his side has starred as a sort of Rin Tin Tin on steroids in a popular TV show alongside his owner Penny (Cyrus). An action-packed New York chase sequence shows off Bolts skills as he takes down an army of marauding trucks helicopters and innumerable ant-like soldiers while sprinting faster than Roadrunner soaring to enormous heights stopping vehicles in their tracks and suspending a bad guy in his jaws from a bridge. All his powers are enhanced for the tube of course but Bolt doesnt know this; hes kept on the set or locations at all times to guarantee he believes everything hes doing -- that Penny is actually in danger from the villains and that he can always save the day. So when Penny returns to Hollywood and Bolt inadvertently ends up on the streets of Manhattan alone he doesnt understand why his customary abilities fail him. You need to take this canine mental lapse in good faith which little kids will likely do more readily than their more jaded chaperones. All the same it takes the entire movie for Bolt to locate his inner real dog with most of his education coming from wise-girl tutoring supplied by black-and-white street cat Mittens (Susie Essman) an abandoned house pet now reduced to skin and bones. This being a movie in which animals can speak with one another but not with humans Mittens spars with Bolt from the outset like a spunky seen-it-all heroine from a 1930s Warner Bros. programmer but without that quality of banter. Film feels particularly flat during the stretch that sees the pair stowing away on a westbound U-Haul truck to search for Penny; their repartee is off-puttingly argumentative and Bolts overplayed phobia about Styrofoam proves entirely unfunny. However things pick up at an Ohio rest stop where they are joined by Rhino (Mark Walton providing the pics best voicing) a roly-poly hamster quite adept at maneuvering the clear plastic ball in which he spends most of his time. Rhinos antics provide welcome comic relief as well as a buffer for the cat-and-dog exchanges. With Mittens having to explain to her delusional pal that ""Nothing you think is real is real"" she proceeds to instruct Bolt in the simple pleasures of being a dog such as sticking your head into the wind from a vehicle romping through a sprinkler or cavorting with other dogs. A particularly felicitous passage sees the animals occupying a prefab house being transported by truck which permits Mittens to instruct Bolt on the niceties of home life while ruing her own lost domesticity. After a spell in Las Vegas the journey winds up at a Hollywood studio for an unsurprising action climax that once again mixes fantasy and reality. One decidedly Pixar-like touch is the deliberate fudging of time period. While the high-tech superhero aspects of the TV show and the Vegas on view clearly define the setting as the present day the backdrops hark nostalgically back to the late-50s/early-60s ambiance of ""The Incredibles"" and ""Cars."" Only older buildings are seen in the films conspicuously underpopulated Manhattan; the Middle America passed through possesses an appealingly idyllic timeless quality; and even the New Yawk accents of Mittens and a trio of brilliantly animated ""Italian"" pigeons seem a couple of generations old. ""Wall-E"" is also brought to mind due to the fact that a very large number of the films incidental human characters not to mention Rhino are extremely fat. Voicings from Travolta and Cyrus on down are pro but unexceptional. First-time directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard have both worked at Disney for 14 years in various capacities and pics visuals are similarly proficient without inspiration. John Powells vigorous score adds propulsion and excitement and the soundtrack includes two new songs with a Cyrus-Travolta duet ""I Thought I Lost You"" featured over the end credits. Film will be released in flat and 3-D versions and the latter looked great at the screening caught.
