Bassett in theaters Oct. 26 2012. Photo Credit Open Road Films advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A teenage girl hunted by shadowy figures must confront her mysterious past. BOTTOM LINE This wretched screen version of a survival video game is hampered less by its bottom- barrel acting than by its completely witless script. Its an insult to bad horror movies. CAST Adelaide Clemens Kit Harington Carrie-Anne Moss LENGTH 134 If youve played a few rounds of the Konami video game that inspired ""Silent Hill Revelation 3D"" you might understand whats happening on screen. If not I guarantee that you will have no idea. Horror flicks arent exactly famous for their airtight plots but ""Revelation"" -- a sequel to 2006s ""Silent Hill"" -- is in a league of its own. Our heroine is Heather Mason (Adelaide Clemens) a teenager plagued by nightmares about a dark burg called Silent Hill. Its an otherworldly place (though it once had a coal industry) and its accessible only through a supernatural portal (or by car). Its amusement park is now used mainly for torture. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Heather and her dad Harry (Sean Bean reprising a thankless role) are on the run from shadowy forces but the moment they arrive in their new Anytown strange things begin to happen. Faceless monsters appear on the street little kids giggle ghoulishly and Heathers high school suddenly transforms into the set of a Slipknot video. Only her cute classmate Vincent (Kit Harington) seems to sympathize. Soon theyll both enter Silent Hill. What ghastly creatures dwell there? For starters far-fallen actors Malcolm McDowell as a gashed-up mental patient and Carrie-Anne Moss playing a demonic matriarch. Mostly though Silent Hill is filled with horror-fantasy figures from a schoolboys sketchbook cleaver-wielding nurses an armored bodybuilder a naked lady. What makes this movie so wretched isnt the dopey effects or the bottom-barrel acting but Michael J. Bassetts incoherent script and plodding direction. ""Revelation"" is incredibly boring as well as totally baffling. If anyone can explain why this movie ends with a shot of speeding police cars please let me know.

Despite what the ending of the last film might have had you think the young daughter of Rose and Chris de Silva (Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean each reprising their roles) has returned to reality from the ash-covered hell of Silent Hill and these days she has adopted the cover identity of Heather (and is now played by Adelaide Clemens). Soon to be eighteen years of age shes blending in at her fifth town in the past six years when mysterious figures show up to kidnap dear old Dad and lure her back to Silent Hill for the sake of its cult of the damned and their nutty penchant for human sacrifices. For those who dont remember the chief locale is a still-smoldering ghost town that tends to lapse at the whims of a local demon into a tetanus-breeding realm filled with faceless fiends sound-sensitive zombie nurses men with pyramid helmets toting around big blades and other ghoulish developments. Worry not though - this is all reintroduced in addition to a litany of other rules and exceptions that generally take the eeriness out of the supernatural elements at play. (""You can never leave the town Unless you can"") Gans film may have been a rather literal adaptation of gameplay with characters retrieving objects and memorizing maps but it was never quite as insulting as what writer/director Michael J. Bassett (""Solomon Kane"") has cooked up. The often stiff dialogue can be boiled down to either ultra-obvious observations or pure exposition and neither Clemens nor co-lead Kit Harington (never this bad on ""Game of Thrones"") do the material any favors. Mitchell and Deborah Kara Unger make dutiful cameos Bean sticks around for a bit longer than either of them while Martin Donovan Malcolm McDowell and Carrie-Anne Moss nearly embarrass themselves as respectively a private eye a mental patient and a fanatical cult leader. When the plot isnt a transparent sequence of haunted houses (rusty school rusty mall rusty asylum rusty amusement park) populated chiefly by flickering lights and the franchises pre-established boogeymen it incorporates an ill-conceived mannequin monster that comes off like leftovers from ""I Robot""; a protagonist/antagonist relationship identical to that between Harry Potter and Voldemort; a magically vital medallion laughably dubbed ""the seal of Metatron""; a spare villain whose eventual appearance owes a clear debt to ""Hellraiser""; and a demoness decked out in Juggalo make-up. The first ""Silent Hill"" may have been silly but at least it was both direct and directed well bringing its hellish landscape to convincing life at nearly every turn. The distractingly digital and dense ""Revelation"" conversely demonstrates what half the budget and twice the story can do to turn a fake nightmare into a real chore.

Credit Open Road Films The distinction between actors and special effects shrinks ever further in the video game-turned-horror film ""Silent Hill Revelation 3D"" which reduces its human players to plastic action figures in tired genre settings.A sequel to ""Silent Hill"" from 2006 the movie follows Heather (Adelaide Clemens) now almost 18 who has had to change her name from Alessa in her wanderings with her father (Sean Bean). The back story -- and the current one -- are hazy but apparently Heathers mom (Radha Mitchell) was lost to Silent Hill a town-dreamscape of shifting environments and now Dad has been spirited away and Heather must rescue him.With her new high school friend Vincent (Kit Harington) she enters this nightmare realm comprising wheezy horror hangouts like an asylum an amusement park an abattoir and a surgery room all abounding with dank dusty detritus. And she encounters malevolent entities (a pyramid-headed executioner harpy-like nurses a creature cobbled from mannequin limbs) that manifest a mild modicum of invention. She also briefly interacts with yes actors many of whom (Deborah Kara Unger Malcolm McDowell Carrie-Anne Moss) deserve much much better.The film is nothing if not liberal with its bloodletting which integrates cleverly at times with the 3-D lopped fingers for example fly toward the audience. But personalities and plot are thumbnail sketches at best. Silent Hill gamers have goals to reach for; ""Silent Hill Revelation 3D"" viewers receive little to sustain them.""Silent Hill Revelation 3D"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for brief nudity and violence.

"With Silent Hill Revelation 3D more horror mumbo jumbo in 3D - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate With Silent Hill Revelation 3D more horror mumbo jumbo in 3D Share Tweet Adelaide Clemens in ""Silent Hill Revelation 3D."" Open Road Films Share Tweet By Ethan Gilsdorf Globe Correspondent | 10.27.12 | 941 AM Like the video games in the ""survival horror"" Silent Hill franchise ""Silent Hill Revelation 3D"" continues the story of a forlorn mining town fused to coexisting universes full of occult practices. The first film adaptation ""Silent Hill"" came out in 2006; in the video game series were up to part nine released earlier this month. Here in part two of movie-land single dad Sean Bean (""Game of Thrones"") must protect his daughter Heather (Adelaide Clemens) after wife Rose (Radha Mitchell seen in flashback) in part one rescued her from Silent Hill and disappeared. All grown up Heather is sullen and detached partly because her father moves her around from school to school -- and partly because wherever she goes light bulbs flicker and tortured humanoids writhe before her. When Dad is abducted Heather teams up with fellow rebel with a cause Vincent (Kit Harington also from ""Game of Thrones"") to get him back. Before long Heather is in Silent Hill navigating a maze of dusty corridors catwalks and ventilation shafts in a ruined asylum inexplicably located beneath an amusement park. Oddly plastic bags figure strongly in the production design; mannequin parts merry-go-round horses and carnival-prize rabbits are all wrapped in the blood-stained material. Was it an environmental decision -- reuse recycle re-skewer? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Whatever the thinking ""Silent Hill Revelation 3D"" quickly devolves into a smorgasbord of sutured faces and blades poking the viewer in the eye. The effects drip and drown the action Fog and cinders fill the air shingles fly off rooftops into storms of black clouds walls melt into what looks like ribbons of bacon. Amid the eviscerations and mumbo jumbo about medallions and destinies theres a thin metaphorical undercurrent that might resonate with teen viewers. Both Heather and Vincent voice the angst of being the outcast. ""By the time any one of you here finds out anything about me worth knowing Ill move on"" she grumps during her first day in class. ""Im lost"" are the words that bind them. But the viewer is lost too. It would be more fun to be Sean Bean and blow away the baddies in a game than to watch this unoriginal dreck.

An ugly assaultive collection of jump-scares the sequel picks up the convoluted story of Silent Hill a ghost town that occasionally transforms into a rusty corrugated wasteland populated by fleshy grotesqueries straight out of Clive Barkers dream journal. It feels like a Nine Inch Nails music video could break out at any moment. The creepy girl from the first film is now a teenager (Adelaide Clemens) but shes still pursued by forces of darkness too evil to make any sense. When her father (Sean Bean) is kidnapped she must return to Silent Hill to rescue him and stop the mysterious Order of Valtiel by combining the two halves of the Seal of Metatron and wading through a whole lot of similarly meaningless mythology. As it stands there?s plenty of exposition but not much explanation. The dialogue is clunkier than Pyramid Head?s enormous polygonal noggin and the frights don?t ever get more complex than the fake-out snake-in-a-peanut-canister variety. (In one scene pop-tarts explode out of a toaster like a car backfiring.) Bean and Malcolm McDowell slum it enjoyably in their brief roles although they spend most of their scenes in chains which makes it seem as if they were forced into the movie against their will. Admittedly there?s not much here that should have attracted them. This sequel is very grim pickings. D+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

(Everett Collection / Everett Col) BY Miriam Bale NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday October 26 2012 532 PM Title Silent Hill Film Info Director Michael J. Bassett (134). R Violence. Area theaters. When her father disappears Heather Mason is drawn into a strange and terrifying alternate reality that holds answers to the horrific nightmares that have plagued her since childhood. Director Michael J. Bassett (134). R Violence. Area theaters. ""Never build on an ancient Indian burial ground -- I thought everyone knew that"" says the hunky sidekick to spunky heroine Heather (Adelaide Clemens) as they search for her lost father and unravel the implausible absurdly complex yet predictable plot involving an apocalyptic cult trapped in a coal-mining town ruled by a demon child. Sightseeing in this town includes a bloody amusement park endless sacrificial rites and an amusing campy performance by Malcolm McDowell as the town pariah. Adelaide Clemens who looks like a less-whimpering Michelle Williams gives a strong performance that somewhat grounds this film. Its a movie that for the most part makes no sense at all when it tries to cut between Heathers confusion between real life and nightmares. But once the plot leaves reality altogether and enters the nonlogic of the Order this complicated cult it lets loose with inspired special effects and makeup including mechanical spiders that turn girls into mannequins. But the climactic battle of guns and supernatural forces is resolved too quickly in ""Silent Hill"" with no real resolution except that the scene is over. Once the 3-D special effects look dated -- 20 or maybe even five years from now -- this head-scratcher of a movie could be ripe to become a camp classic. But for now the humorless approach to this inane mess is embarrassing rather than hilarious.

TWITTER A belated sequel to the big-screen adaptation of the popular videogame franchise. If the terms ""Order of Valtiel"" ""Halo of the Sun"" and ""Seal of Metatron"" dont mean anything to you then you are definitely not the target audience of the film Silent Hill Revelation 3D. Arriving six years--a cinematic eternity--after the first adaptation of the popular videogame series this installment seems all too aware that only the most rabid gamers will possibly remember anything of the 2006 original so writer/director Michael J. Bassett helpfully provides numerous scenes in which the characters deliver reams of exposition so that the rest of us can try to figure exactly what the hell is going on. Its a losing proposition. Suffice it to say that the little girl in the original is now eighteen and has assumed a new identity as Heather (Adelaide Clemens distractingly looking exactly like Michelle Williams) living on the run with her father Harry (Sean Bean) from the evil forces of the town of Silent Hill who have claimed her mother (Radha Mitchell). Living with endless nightmares both waking and dreaming she comes home one day to find her father gone and the message ""Come to Silent Hill"" written in blood on the wall forcing her and new high school friend Vincent (Kit Harington) to journey to the ash-drenched hellscape to rescue him. Cue an endless series of nightmarish images adapted from the game featuring a plethora of creatures engaging in gory R-rated mayhem ranging from homicidal nurses to a spider-like figure who turns people into mannequins to a pyramid-headed guy wielding a blade that seems entirely too heavy for him. Oh and cameos by the likes of the slumming Carrie-Anne Moss and most entertainingly Malcom McDowell the latter no doubt ruefully recalling that he once worked with the likes of Stanley Kubrick and Lindsay Anderson. Director Bassett (Solomon Kane) clearly knows his way around the fantasy genre and the imagery much of it lifted from the games is visually arresting especially the 3D-enhanced swirling ash that seems to literally envelop the viewer. At other times he indulges too heavily in the formats in-your-face aspects thrusting swords and the like directly at us as if it was still the 1950s. And his propensity for shock cuts--a pop tart erupting from a toaster really?--quickly becomes annoying. Reprising their roles from the original Bean Mitchell and Deborah Kara Unger prove game if nothing else and Martin Donovan sporting a very unflattering hat delivers a vivid turn as an ill-fated private investigator. Clemens--who doubles as her characters evil doppelganger in make-up suggesting shes just come from a Marilyn Manson concert--effectively delivers a wide variety of frightened reactions although shes less convincing delivering such lines of dialogue as ""How can you live like this?""

As a sequel to an adaptation of a videogame the muddled new horror sequel Silent Hill Revelation 3-D is burdened with having to laboriously unpack so much conflicting information about the haunted town and child-demon at the center of its faltering humorless narrative that a more honest title would be Silent Hill Exposition. Newcomer Adelaide Clemens a dead ringer for Michelle Williams right down to her permanent frown and haunted air stars as a glum teenager whose adopted father world-weary Silent Hill survivor Sean Bean has been shuttling her from town to town for enigmatic reasons. Ominous visions of grotesque demons seem to follow Clemens every where she goes all pointing the way to the eponymous town a horrific realm dominated by a strange cult. When Bean goes missing Clemens travels to Silent Hill with classmate Kit Harington who has a tortured mysterious past of his own. Silent Hills cast is haunted by the still-living paycheck-hungry ghosts of character actors past Hal Hartley repertory player Martin Donovan briefly livens up the proceedings as a fedora-sporting detective but like supporting characters played by the overqualified likes of Malcolm McDowell and Deborah Kara Unger hes on hand solely to deliver a relevant bit of information. In videogame terms their only purpose is to help a protagonist defeat an immediate threat and advance to the next level. Writer-director Michael Bassett gives the film a dull grey-white palette and a dour relentlessly morose tone that ensures the film is neither scary nor fun. Stiff episodic and disjointed Silent Hill Revelation 3D replicates its source material all too faithfully. It confirms once again that with the notable exception of Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World a film that feels like a videogame is never a positive development.

Michael J. Bassetts sequel to Christophe Ganss freaky underrated 2006 original is an unholy creation divided between grotesque set pieces and endless exposition the latter so consuming and mind-numbing that this is less a nightmare than an afternoon nap. Lured to ash-snowing dreamland Silent Hill after her dad (Sean Bean) is kidnapped Heather searches for him through a creepy asylum a nasty amusement park and countless hallways with rotting walls along the way contending with faceless limbless creatures and cleaver-wielding nurses--all shot by Bassett with the maximum of gimmicky 3-D effects in which blades and decapitated heads fly off the screen. When not fleeing mutants Heather blabs on and on about Silent Hills ruling demon (and the convoluted mythology that links her to it) with a bland love interest (Kit Harington) and a trio of actors--Malcolm McDowell Carrie-Anne Moss and Deborah Kara Unger--whose sole purpose is to wear ratty silly hobo costumes. With horror altogether absent and a plot drowning in insipid convolutions its a film whose early warning to Heather should be heeded ""Dont go to Silent Hill.""

"Silent Hill Revelation | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Silent Hill Revelation Dennis Harvey Film Critic 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr October 26 2012 | 1023AM PT A cheaper cheesier sequel thats worse than its predecessor on every level (save being a half-hour shorter) and takes no special advantage of the stereoscopic process. Christopher Gans 2006 vidgame adaptation ""Silent Hill"" was slammed for its incomprehensible storyline but its frequently striking visuals made a 3D revisitation at least semi-promising. Alas that promise is ill kept in ""Silent Hill Revelation"" a cheaper cheesier sequel thats worse than its predecessor on every level (save being a half-hour shorter) and takes no special advantage of the stereoscopic process. Bypassing advance press screenings for good reason writer-director Michael J. Bassetts pic will scare up some bucks through Halloween though the unlikelihood of its actually scaring viewers suggests any future ""Hill"" sequels will go straight to VOD. Heather (Aussie thesp Adelaide Clemens) and her father (Sean Bean) have been changing identities and moving from town to town ever since his wife and her adopted mother Rosa (Radha Mitchell briefly seen) rescued the now-grown child from netherworld Silent Hill but remained trapped there herself. En route Dad killed an intruder representing ""the Order"" which wants the kid back so the police as well as nightmarish specters are on the duos trail. At her new school Heather shrugs off overtures of friendship from cute boy Vincent (Kit Harington ""Game of Thrones""). But when she comes home to find her dad gone dragged off to you-know-where she enlists Vincent -- whose presence turns out to be more purposeful than he first admits -- to drive her to the allegedly uninhabited Silent Hill shuttered by a still-burning underground coal fire decades earlier. More hectic and far less eerie than the first film ""Revelation"" runs screaming from one scaled-down setpiece to another. Characters brought back from the original include demon child Alessa (Erin Pitt) whose blood sacrifice caused the towns original damnation; her hatchet-wielding guardian/executioner Red Pyramid (Roberto Campanella); those stab-happy buxom faceless nurses; and Dahlia (Deborah Kara Unger) who like new additions played by Martin Donovan and Malcolm McDowell (hammy) is given some undeliverable dumb-mythology exposition. There is one good monster a tarantula-like creature whose many limbs and faces are all assembled from mannequin parts. But even its scene isnt very special and elsewhere British helmer Bassett (whose prior genre films such as ""Solomon Kane"" were better if still weakly scripted) shows no affinity for the grotesquely beautiful surrealism that distinguished the vidgame series and earlier feature. His two climaxes here are laughably routine. If the original seems to have been shot on a vast elaborately dressed soundstage this follow-up often feels crammed into a few linked storage lockers. Theres gore but precious little imagination or mystique at work in a pic that looks hastily conceived and executed on all fronts. Amid the watered-down tech package Akira Yamoakas songs get billed above returning composer Jeff Dannas score though one would be hard-pressed to differentiate between them.

"Silent Hill Revelation 3D review Welcome to mine nightmare | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSilent Hill Revelation 3D review Welcome to mine nightmareThe made-in-Ontario horror film series Silent Hill is designed to dazzle the eye (and it really does) rather than enlighten the mind in this town of deep ash and shallow melodrama.Adelaide Clemens in the special effects-laden Silent Hill Revelation.  (Alliance films)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 26 2012Silent Hill Revelation 3D (out of 4)Starring Adelaide Clemens Kit Harington Sean Bean Carrie-Anne Moss Deborah Kara Unger and Radha Mitchell. Directed by Michael J. Bassett. 94 minutes. Opens Oct. 26 at major theatres. ""There are many Silent Hills"" Malcolm McDowells shrubbery muncher says to a visitor in the freak show that is Silent Hill Revelation 3D. ""Are you sure its this one?"" Article Continued BelowExcellent query and also the films best in-joke. This is the second Silent Hill movie coming more than six years after the original but its based on the third chapter of a survival horror video game that now stretches to nine installments and counting.Not that it really matters since this made-in-Ontario film series is designed to dazzle the eye (and it really does) rather than enlighten the cranium (the ""revelation"" part of the title feels like another joke). Only true devotees of the game are likely to recognize many of the figures on the screen or care about a byzantine story stitched together from innumerable horror and fantasy shows.Silent Hill Revelation 3D has the fatal problem common to most video games adapted to the screen. The interactive game allows players a fighting chance to determine the outcome (Silent Hill 3 even has ""normal"" and ""possessed"" settings). The set-in-stone screen version enforces passive viewing which 3D does nothing to improve.And so we sit slack-jawed and gaping as protagonist Heather (Adelaide Clemens looking distractingly like a young Michelle Williams) endures a ghastly opening dream sequence that makes A Nightmare on Elm Street seem like restful slumber.She awakes to the reality of life as a fugitive. She and her dad Harry (Sean Bean of TVs Game of Thrones) are on the run from dire circumstances that are more implied than revealed (writer/director Michael J. Bassett does everything on the trot). Theyre forced once again to change addresses schools and even names.Shes not in a hurry to make new friends even with fellow new student Vincent (Kit Harington another Game of Thrones recruit) practically wearing a sign proclaiming himself the movies love interest.""I wont IM you Facebook you tweet you or read your blog"" sullen Heather tells her fellow scholars and if that isnt the most 21st century of insults I dont know what is.We learn after a fashion that Heather must travel to Silent Hill a West Virginia ghost town where the coal mines long since shut down but the fires still burn. Shes been told not to go by her secretive dad who has suddenly vanished but what are you supposed to do when somebody goes to the trouble of writing ""Come to Silent Hill"" in blood on your living room wall? Talk about engraved invitations.It is in Silent Hill that Heather will uncover hidden truths about herself and her fractured family while fighting a circus of cultish weirdos (McDowell amongst them) and brandishing a magic amulet ""The Seal of Metatron"" that looks as if it were ripped off the body of a slain disco dancer in 1976.Careful viewers may make their own astounding discovery about this town of deep ash and shallow melodrama. The presence of Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix) Deborah Kara Unger (The Game) and Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black) all of them movie action women of a decade or more ago suggests that Silent Hill really isnt hell on Earth but rather the last roundup for furloughed fantasy femmes.Their abundant acting talents are wasted here since Silent Hill relies on shock visuals most of them involving faceless beings that could haunt even Freddy Kruegers nightmares.Theyre a great calling card for the Toronto special effects people who made them. But for the next Silent Hill movie already hinted the producers should go whole hog and hire Canuck director Guy Maddin. He really knows what to do with a village of freaks while having a few dark chuckles at the same time.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.
