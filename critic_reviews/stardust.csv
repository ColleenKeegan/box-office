It plays like a live-action riposte to Shrek. As if to compensate for carrying human baggage - sorry actors - Vaughn throws everything at the screen he can. Castles in the sky and hovels on the ground come hurtling towards you courtesy of combined computer and visual effects. Before you settle into its amusingly generic Victorian England setting (and the comforts of Ian McKellens velvety voice-over) youre rocketed off on Google Earth-style journeys to the magical mock-medieval manically overdesigned virtual world of Stormhold then back again to its teeming independent microcosmics satellite hidden behind the olde villages guarded stone wall.

Charlie Cox in naturalist register makes a fist of the young cambric-shirted hero - Tristan  charged with bringing back a fallen star (which turns into an annoying Claire Danes) by his hiss-ably haughty love (tressed-to-kill Sienna Miller). But the rest - OToole Pfeiffer Gervais et al - wisely camp it up with Robert De Niro out-camping everyone in a film-stealing turn as buckleswashing Captain Shakespeare.

David James/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption David James/Paramount Pictures Charlie Coxs heroic Tristan defends Claire Danes Yvaine from many a peril in Stardust. David James/Paramount Pictures Director Matthew VaughnGenre Fantasy RomanceRunning Time 128 minutes (Requires RealPlayer) A fantastical romance from Neil Gaiman a graphic novelist better known for fantasies of a more combative sort. With Stardust hes invented a sprite-infested kingdom where witches battle princes for a chance at immortality and upset that kingdoms balance of power by bringing together a pair of lovers who might legitimately be called star-crossed One of them (Claire Danes) is an actual fallen star the other (Charlie Cox) a barrier-crossing visitor from our own magic-challenged reality. Neither of them is nearly as interesting as the folks they encounter. Theres Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) a witch whose every spell causes her to age; Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Niro) a pirate who growls at his crew when hes not dressing en travesti; supercilious prince Secundus (Rupert Everett) whos funnier dead than alive; and Ferdy the Fence (Ricky Gervais) a scurrilously squawking merchant who doesnt know when to keep his mouth shut. The special effects are indeed special in Matthew Vaughns elaborate spectacle and the screenplays pretty hilarious though its hard to tell just what audience the film is aimed at. Tolkienites may find it a touch light and its probably not hip enough for the crowds that flocked to Knocked Up. For incurable romantics though its just about right.

Good Acting and great storyline but if youre over about 13ish and under about 18 then dont bother. Youll come out thinking youre back in Year 4. Still good film with a few nice little twists. All i can say is Ricky Gervais wasnt used enough. Hes a funny bloke but only turned up in a couple of scenes. Oh and youll never see Robert de Niro the same way ever ever again. Great ideas.

Thats Your Role. Stardust overcomes the silly obstacles it sets for itself. Plus Leos scary documentary. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo David James/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) Several hours after I emerged from the documentary The 11th Hour in which Leonardo DiCaprio solemnly explains how humankind is doomed if our species doesnt work with instead of against nature Brooklyn was hit by its first tornado since 1889. The next day I watched Max von Sydowa week after the death of Ingmar Bergmanfail to hold his own against Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan in Rush Hour 3 then get gunned down by a French taxi driver who had just discovered his inner American cowboy. An hour later I gazed on Robert De Nirounder the direction of Madonnas husbands best manas a closeted pirate captain prancing to the Can-Can in a tutu. I havent checked the Rapture Index but surely this is a cosmic convergence. The end might well be nigh. Portents of apocalypse aside I had a good time at Madonnas husbands best mans film Stardust a romantic fantasy loosely based on a novel by Neil Gaiman (i.e. they paid him a lot of money none of which he should spend on a ticket). Its puffed up in obvious ways but disarmingly puckish in others. As that capering pirate De Niro is god-awfulyet his gung-ho spirit wins him Brownie points. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a withered wicked witch who transforms herself into Michelle Pfeiffer and at least one critic into a slobbering cretin When the camera revolves around her as she changes and ends on her new face shes so stunningly mythically gorgeous that the fairy-tale universe becomes real. The magic of cheekbones. Pfeiffer plays the same stereotypical shrew as in Hairspray but this time her slow burns have great punch lines With exquisite annoyance she flings out an arm and turns a goat into a man a laddie into a lassie and a rival into a flaming torso. Give the lady her due When the script calls for witchy cackles she does not cackle witchily halfway. BACKSTORY Stardust novelist Neil Gaiman has a vast imagination. But it can hinder him. As he told Rain Taxi Id love to write some porn but I dont know if I have the right engines. When I was a young man and I was tempted to write porn imaginary parents would appear over my shoulder and read what I was writing; just about the point that I managed to banish the imaginary parents real children would lean over my shoulder and read what I was writing. The Pirates of the Caribbean people would have stretched this material out to eight-plus hours while a visionary genius like Terry Gilliam would have royally screwed it up by putting more emphasis on the scenic wheels and pulleys than the narrative. The model here luckily is The Princess Bride with a dollop of The Black Adderand to cut the facetiousness nonstop rhapsodic heavenly choirs. After about five prologues a star falls from the sky into a walled magic kingdom nestled somewhere in the English countryside west of C.S. Lewiss wardrobe and the young shop clerk Tristan (Charlie Cox) goes off to get it; he wants to impress the featherbrained rich girl (Sienna Miller) he loves. Ive left out key details but the big thing is that even though the star makes a stadium-size crater it turns out to be the size of Claire Danes. In fact it is Claire Danes. Having to embody a star could in theory put an end to ones stardom but Danes is one of the few actresses who can bring off guilelessness. Accepting herand not rolling our eyes when she smiles and the white light radiates from her beingis a kind of pact we make with the filmmakers. It made me feel rather nobleand resent Tristan when he ties her up to take back to his girlfriend. (Nothing says romance like the gift of a kidnapped injured woman Danes exclaims.) Director Matthew Vaughns first film was the violent self-congratulatory thriller Layer Cake and Stardust has a fair amount of grue for a storybook romance. (Its a little off-putting when one of the villains skewers the comic relief.) But some of the best gags are the nastiest like the family of princes who murder one another for the crown but stick around as crabby ghoststheir throats still cut faces smashed etc. Ricky Gervais pops up as a scheming but buffoonish black marketeer; his haggles with De Niro and Pfeiffer are polished vaudeville bits thatunlike a lot of his self-humiliating shticksgo on just long enough. Considerably shapelier is Death at a Funeral a dark British farce whose conventionality should not be held against itold-fashioned farces are murder to bring off. Two keys to doing so Wind the jack-in-the-boxes in full view of the audience and arrange them to pop up with trigonometric precision at the most embarrassing moments; and choose a venue in which the embarrassment will be especially acute (the stuffier the setting the funnier the shitting). Dean Craigs script has an ideal venue (upper-crust English memorial service) and a heap of good jack-in-the-boxes (mislabeled hallucinogens scandalous gay photos expulsive bowels). It goes soft but even a gelded traditional farce is more potent than most of our slob comedies. The movie has an unfunny and utterly perfect center Matthew MacFadyen as a son of the deceased a man of meager talent but capacious soul. Forever in the shadow of his hotshot irresponsible novelist brother (Rupert Graves) this grave fellow must rise to the occasion when an interloper (Peter Dinklage) arrives with a mysterious relationship to the dead man. Im not sure how we should feel about the Dark Other being embodied by a dwarf but Dinklage is in clover He finds a marvelous balance between avarice and heartbreak. The final nail in the patriarchal coffin is the accidental ingestion of a designer hallucinogen by an earnest lawyer (Alan Tudyk) who wants to make a good impression on his fiancees family. Perched naked atop the manor house radiantly at one with the universe he is a thing of farcical beautythe Thinker on acid. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Directed by Matthew Vaughn. 130 minutes. At major theatres. PG   Article Continued BelowAs a winking self-referential fairytale for grownups Matthew Vaughns adaptation of Neil Gaimans much-loved illustrated novel Stardust is pitched somewhere between the screwball whimsy of Rob Reiners The Princess Bride and the heavy-metal camp of a Terry Gilliam movie.Though nobly intentioned it misses the mark of both landing with something of a glittering thud somewhere in between. Stardust with its myriad make-believe visions of magic kingdoms beauty-lusting witches and flying pirate vessels should float and sparkle and dance in the imagination.Instead it sits there flailing and screaming much like Yvaine (Claire Danes) the bitchy fallen star who is the object of the obligatory quest.Set in a magic kingdom separated from merrie olde run-of-the-mill England by a stone fence the movie dispatches the bland Tristan (Charlie Cox) in search of a wayward celestial body as a declaration of love for the spoiled and undeserving Sienna Miller.Although taken aback by the fact the star has become especially cranky (and RADA-accented) Tristan nevertheless takes the glittering maid hostage and heads for home. On his way his progress is not only impeded by Michelle Pfeiffers gleefully conniving witch Lamia Robert De Niros swashbuckling Capt. Shakespeare and Mark Strongs necessarily evil prince its tripped up by a narrative rendered halting and bumpy by an overabundance of competing magical incidents.As a novelist Gaiman is renowned for his deft way with intricately spun multi-stranded narratives he can make complexity flow with whimsical agility and he ushers his readers through the various chambers in his narrative mazes with expert expediency. He may be working hard but you dont feel the effort.Vaughn the British director of the cheeky gangster romp Layer Cake never quite finds the same lubrication. And you can feel him trying trying to impress less than seduce and trying to compensate for his movies lack of forward momentum with a rotating series of look-at-me showstoppers. This leaves Stardust feeling episodic and clunky constantly straining for the impression of overall coherent design that Gaiman renders invisible.The result is an experience that compels less as a result of narrative propulsion than the sights glimpsed along the way especially when those sights include such diversions as the literally deteriorating witch played by Pfeiffer De Niros Broadway-bound pirate and Ricky Gervaiss turn as a decidedly hedgehogish black marketer.Stardust may burn up in orbit but theres some real treasure strewn in the debris.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Movie review Showtimes""Stardust"" with Claire Danes Charlie Cox Sienna Miller Ricky Gervais Jason Flemyng Rupert Everett Peter OToole Michelle Pfeiffer Robert De Niro. Directed by Matthew Vaughn from a screenplay by Jane Goldman and Vaughn based on the novel by Neil Gaiman.129 minutes. Rated PG-13 for fantasy violence and some risque humor. Complete with a corset-wearing pirate a witch whose beauty is only skin deep a cranky star and a dying king ""Stardust"" is a wildly crowded and sporadically entertaining fantasy adventure. Based on Neil Gaimans best-selling fantasy novel its reminiscent of ""The Princess Bride"" (if a bit less funny) in its fairy-tale whimsy rambling storyline and varied roster of characters. ""Stardust"" takes place in the extra-picturesque Victorian village of Wall where a young man named Tristan (Charlie Cox) is in love with the prettiest -- and apparently snottiest -- girl in the village Victoria (Sienna Miller). To win her heart he promises to take a journey to the magical land across Walls wall Stormhold to capture a fallen star. Turns out the star is also a pretty girl Yvaine (Claire Danes) whos understandably peeved about Tristans quest. (Stars apparently get as cranky as the rest of us when they have to walk a long way.) Meanwhile elsewhere in Stormhold a hideous witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) plots to secure eternal youth; a king (Peter OToole) on his deathbed sparks a competition among his sons for his throne; the pirate Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Niro) dances a cancan; another witch (Melanie Hill) keeps a beautiful young woman (Kate Magowan) captive; and yes a unicorn turns up. Its all very busy indeed and -- depending on your tolerance for fantasy conventions -- often a little silly. And its a change of direction for director Matthew Vaughn whose previous film ""Layer Cake"" showed him perfectly at home in the gritty realm of crime drama. Here his hand is less sure ""Stardust"" suffers from uneven pacing and some cheesy-looking special effects. But the fine cast keeps things watchable. Pfeiffer in her second villainous turn this summer (following her delicious Velma Von Tussle in ""Hairspray"") happily gobbles the scenery shoots green vapor through her finger and cackles with wicked glee. Once transformed into a beauty she unfurls her lines like silk reveling in her own glamorous evilness. (A side note Expect to see numerous articles praising Pfeiffer for her courage in allowing herself to be uglified on screen. Why is it that female actors are so often lauded for their ""bravery"" when they appear on film looking less than attractive? When male actors do it its just called acting.) De Niro in a truly bizarre role prances about like a happy puppy and Rupert Everett brings his posh-as-expensive-chocolate voice to the role of Secondus the kings most ruthlessly ambitious son. Cox finds little thats distinctive in his role -- hes mostly the person who reacts to what everyone else is doing -- but Danes once she gets past her characters crankiness is charming. Though shes been making movies for a long time Danes still has a genuine freshness and vulnerability on screen; late in the film she makes a speech of love to Tristan thats quite touching. Unfortunately Tristans recently been transformed into a rodent. Such are the perils of fairy tales.

Review Stardust bursts with otherworldly delights 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Stardust Fantasy. Starring Charlie Cox Claire Danes Michelle Pfeiffer Sienna Miller and Robert De Niro. Director Matthew Vaughan. (PG-13. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete listings and show times and to buy tickets to select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies .) If ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" showed what you get when you make a movie fantasy out of an amusement park ride ""Stardust"" shows what you can get when you base one on a novel. ""Stardust"" is in many ways what ""Pirates"" was intended to be - an adventure story set in the past with elements of romance alternating with elements of the grotesque and supernatural. It tells a story on a wide canvas with lots of idiosyncratic characters disparate pockets of adventure and splashy effects. But unlike ""Pirates"" ""Stardust"" is anything but a wretched mess. Its a charming and smartly plotted fantasy that follows several characters each in hot pursuit of something essential to their survival. The stakes are high for everyone and ultimately all the strands come together with a sense of inevitability. The storytelling is the movies prime virtue and everything else is extra - but those extras are generous. ""Stardust"" is a film of humor and imagination with an exceptional cast. Based on the Neil Gaiman novel the story takes place in a world in which there are in fact two distinct worlds separated by a wall. On one side is a picturesque but prosaic English town from about 200 years ago. On the other side is an enchanted forest a world of magic that no mortal has ever seen - until a young man leaps the wall and has a night of bliss with an enslaved princess. Nine months later back in his lackluster town a baby arrives on his doorstep a son named Tristran who becomes the focus of the story. Tristran (Charlie Cox) grows up to become a romantic and something of a bumbler with big dreams and deep emotions. Hes in love with a shallow local girl Victoria (Sienna Miller) and one night as they sit together they see a falling star streak across the sky. In true storybook fashion Tristran tells Victoria that he will return in one week and bring back the star for her which becomes a kind of a romantic test. If he can do that the idea goes he will prove himself worthy and win her hand - or at least prevent her from agreeing to marry someone else. ""Stardust"" sets up a story in which everyone has a selfish motive for finding and possessing the star. Tristran is motivated by love. Michelle Pfeiffer is a 400-year-old witch who needs the star to regain her youth. And an evil prince Septimus (Mark Strong) needs a medallion worn by the star without which he cant take possession of his fathers throne. The star itself is not a thing but a person. Her name is Yvaine (Claire Danes) and she wants to get back to her place in the firmament. Because the characters are all driven by a specific need they drive the story. Michelle Pfeiffer who had lots of fun hamming it up in ""Hairspray"" has even more of a blast in ""Stardust"" as the leader of a coven of three wicked sisters. A temporary spell enables her to regain her youthful looks but in order to make her youth a more permanent feature she needs to kill the star and cut out its heart which shes looking forward to. As a young woman Pfeiffer always had a down-to-earth put-upon grumpiness but that quality was never really exploited. Now in her late 40s she may be coming into her queen years in a particularly entertaining way. She seems to genuinely relish being imperious and appalling. Director Matthew Vaughan casts some famous faces in cameo and feature roles but instead of having them merely show up he places them well and gives them things to do. Ricky Gervais has a couple of funny scenes as a merchant. Peter OToole is sly and absurd as a morally depraved old king. And Robert De Niro clowns it up as a closeted gay pirate ship captain one of the worlds most macho professions. Though the special effects are at times a little more elaborate than necessary they dont overwhelm the storys human scale. Danes with those brown eyes that never lie to the camera conveys the purity of essence one expects from a star - at least the ones in the sky. And Cox in his first important role gives us the scope of Tristrans journey from haplessness to heroism. This is a young leading man with a future. -- Advisory Some grotesque images and violent scenes. To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.

Friday August 10 2007 400 AM Stardust. Fantasy about a young man who enters a magic realm to find a falling star. With Charlie Cox Michelle Pfeiffer Robert De Niro Claire Danes. Director Matthew Vaughn (205). PG-13 Language mild violence. At area theaters. While it wont rival the Harry Potter movies as a cultural milestone the luminous irresistible ""Stardust"" is no less industrious at scavenging myths and legends and making something altogether new from the familiar pickings. Among the ingredients of this romantic comedy/fantasy are unicorns ghosts witches potions enchantments hexes soothsayers entrail readings voodoo and transmogrification - the act of one form changing into something grotesquely different. In the film we see a goat turned into a man a man turned into a rodent and a princess turned into a bird. More to the heart of the story we see a falling star turn into a woman. The star whose human name is Yvaine (Claire Danes) has been brought to earth by a gem shot into the sky upon the death of the king of Stromhold a magical land on the other side of a guarded wall in the English countryside. The gem which Yvaine now wears around her neck and the heart beating in her chest are being sought by the scheming sons of the dead king - he who gets them is heir to the throne - and by the ancient witch Lamia (a fabulous Michelle Pfeiffer) who needs them to provide her and her two sisters eternal youth and beauty. Yvaine herself is sought by Tristan Thorne (Charlie Cox) a handsome young lad from the mortal village of Wall who has promised a local beauty (Sienna Miller) he would enter the forbidden kingdom and bring the fallen star home to her. Adapted from Neil Gaimans novel by director and co-writer Matthew Vaughn ""Stardust"" is a kitchen-sink fantasy in both mood and content. It is exciting funny adventurous magical and very romantic. The special effects are great but the characters are even better. Ricky Gervais is hilarious as a black market trader there is an ensemble of ghosts acting as a wisecracking Greek chorus and Robert De Niros portrayal of the pirate Captain Shakespeare a raging queen with a closet full of froufrou is the must-see cameo of the season. jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Photo Mark Tillie Courtesy Photo Stardust 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Three years ago Matthew Vaughn made his directing debut with Layer Cake a ruthless and sharp-witted gangland thriller starring a pre-Bond Daniel Craig. A blonde showed up but she didnt twinkle and the only noble quest involved some Ecstasy. Yet somehow - using some potent form of magic - Vaughn has journeyed from Londons criminal underworld to the hidden kingdom of Stardust an enchanting fairy tale based (with liberties) on the much-admired novel written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Charles Vess. But fairy tales are dark business after all. If we failed to learn that from the Brothers Grimm we learned it last year from Pans Labyrinth which found midnight horrors under a little girls floorboards. There are a few to be found here. The tale begins with a young man poised at the portal to another world Dunstan (Ben Barnes) who bolts through a gap in the stone fence separating the English village of Wall from a legendary otherworld. Once in the kingdom of Stormhold he wastes no time with a slave girl (Kate Magowan) actually a princess cursed by a witch. Into a yellow wagon they go and nine months later baby. Reared by his father the infant grows up into the venturesome Tristran (Charlie Cox irresistible in a mother-me sort of way). In a fit of unrequited pining for a haughty village girl (Sienna Miller) Tristran vows to retrieve a fallen star from beyond the wall in exchange for her hand in marriage. Off he skedaddles into that same magical realm where he finds at the base of a massive crater a beautiful maiden (Claire Danes). Shes the star. Literally. And quite a droll star too. When Tristran (whose name invokes the legendary Cornish lover) explains that sorry hell be chaining her up and hauling her back to Wall to prove his love she barks ``Nothing says `romance like the gift of a kidnapped injured woman. Stardust is full of such mouthy backtalk. Its also full of moonstruck invention heroes who travel by candlelight pirates who travel by air (where a transgressive Robert De Niro atones for past roles) and a trio of scheming crones who plot to locate the star cut out her beating heart and eat it to restore their youth. The crone queen played by Michelle Pfeiffer with yummy hellcat malevolence uses black magic to feign youthful looks but every now and then a clump of hair falls out or her cleavage sags with a ``whoosh. Competing in the dastardly-villain department are two bloodthirsty princes (Jason Flemyng and Mark Strong) who seek an enchanted locket while their dead brothers (including a smushed Rupert Everett) hang around like rejects from Beetlejuice a Greek chorus of grumpy spectral corpses. Over many miles and much stirring conflict Tristran matures; his story is a bildungsroman decked out with humor and swordplay and woozy romance most of it striking a Princess Bride balance between serious and spoofish fantasy. Is it a kids movie? Its scarier and randier than most (premarital off-screen whoopee twice) and the violence is not without graphic consequences. A decapitated witch twitches and hops like some unfortunate chicken. A slit neck bleeds into a tub. But it doesnt bleed red. In the land of Stormhold royal blue runs through the veins of princes. Fire burns green. Stars glow with desire embracing their beloved until a clear white light illumes them both. No Stardust isnt a childrens movie. Its a movie for anyone of any age who believes in magic - or wishes they did. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals ""Decision Making for Dummies"" eBook for free Fruit of the Loom Mens Boxer Briefs 8-Pack for 12 + pickup...

Actually the star Yvaine (Danes) was knocked from the heavens when the King of Stormhold flings skyward a ruby his sons will need for succession. It is easy to be taken with a fairy tale as sure of its jests and jousts its every rhythm as this one. Director Matthew Vaughn clearly learned the joys of the quickened pace and the cheeky edit while producing Guy Ritchies early knockouts ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."" After a summer scant on surprise this rousing pleasure adapted from Neil Gaimans best-selling novel (itself based on a comic book series) makes some of the others seem even more fleeting. This swift romp (co-written by Vaughn and Jane Goldman) begins with the dulcet tones of Ian McKellen narrating. Sir Ians voice is one of those that induces a state of childlike receptivity. ""Grandfather our teeth are brushed our PJs on lets have a story."" And what a fine tale it is utterly familiar then curved warped to startle and please. A breach in the wall between the human village of Wall and the magical realm of Stormhold leads Dunston Thorne to a different sort of breach. And nine months later the guard at the wall (David Kelly) delivers a baby to Dunston. Eighteen years hence the baby has become a young man. And Tristan (Cox) has his own plans to cross over the wall. He wants to retrieve a fallen star for Victoria (Sienna Miller). The aged guard of the rampart between Wall and Stormhold (played with spry appeal by Kelly) has learned a move or two since Dunston tricked him. As a human saga of misguided desire unfolds on one side of the wall a dramedy of power plays out in Stormhold. Fear not the fact that amusing Rupert Everetts character Secundus is dispatched early on. Three of Secundus six brothers have already departed. Each was delivered to a gray and grainy afterlife by his more cunning sibling. The princes sister has long ago gone missing though the King (Peter OToole) reminds his sons even as he encourages their fratricide that she cannot be an heir. The brother ghosts stick around providing color commentary to the dwindling princes quests. It doesnt take long for Septimus (Mark Strong) to be the last prince standing galloping swashbuckling toward the ruby pendant he must possess to become ruler. Strong takes exquisite delight in making a determined baddie. Indeed some of the greatest joys in ""Stardust"" come in a parade of audacious supporting performances among them Robert De Niro as Capt. Shakespeare a high-skies pirate with secrets and Michelle Pfeiffer as the witch Lamia. In dire need of the heart of a fallen star to rejuvenate their beautiful wickedness Lamia and her sisters hunt Yvaine. As they deplete their caged menagerie for entrail readings they also risk a PETA-style revenge. So brightly does this array shine they might have blinded us to the charms of the couple at the movies core. Yet Danes and especially Cox gain our affections as they begin to share theirs. Visually reminiscent of Terry Gilliams ""The Adventures of Baron Von Munchausen"" Vaughns joyride never veers toward the surreal even as it is willfully fantastical. A boat cuts through cloud and wind. Pirates capture and trade lightning bolts. A witch turns a hapless youth into a goat and a hapless goat into a towel-munching inn keeper. A sorceress holds on to her slave girl (Tristans mother) with an enchanted chain. Ilan Eshkeris score insists on its right to swell and blast. But the bombast suits the moods. This is a film that doesnt take itself too seriously but is aggressively attuned to its fun. As ""Stardust"" begins a full gallop toward its conclusion it asserts again just what grand fun is being had. Will Yvaine and Tristan escape the clutches of Septimus and Lamia? Thats not for us to report. We can tell you this Your own pure escapism is assured. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

"Despite a stellar cast Stardust falls flat - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review Despite a stellar cast Stardust falls flat By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  August 10 2007 Any movie that has Claire Danes playing a fallen star sounds too painful for words. The irony ""Terminator 3"" ""Stage Beauty"" ""The Family Stone"" ""Evening"" Neither her luminousness nor her intelligence has been put to particularly thrilling use. They havent really since she blazed through Baz Luhrmanns ""Romeo + Juliet."" For her sake Im embarrassed to remember how long ago that was. At this point even she seems over herself. The expression she wears in ""Stardust"" a romantic science-fiction fantasy with her as the aforementioned fallen star breaks your heart. It seems stuck between a grimace and a cringe Its the face of a maiden caught taking out the garbage.This movie also happens to have parts for Michelle Pfeiffer Robert De Niro Peter OToole Sienna Miller Ricky Gervais and others. So ""Stardust"" is not just a nadir for Danes. It stinks for almost everybody. But Danes is the one person who seems to show it. The setting is a crypto-medieval English village called Wall so named for the pile of cobblestones that separates the villagers from Stormhold the parallel universe just beyond it.One love-struck villager named Tristan (Charlie Cox) promises to deliver a fallen star to the too-beautiful lass (Miller) for whom he pines requiring him to sneak across the wall. He finds his crashed star named Yvaine but has to protect her from both the family of feuding princes who need her powers to ascend to the throne and the wizened witch (Pfeiffer) who wants the stars heart to keep her looking young forever.""Stardust"" certainly could have gone somewhere fun. But the magic and zip you need to get a blimp like this off the ground is scarce. Nothing Matthew Vaughn does with the material -- he and Jane Goldman adapted it from Neil Gaiman and Charles Vesss novel -- generates much enchantment. Vaughn produced Guy Ritchies gangster pictures and before this film made his own knockoff called ""Layer Cake."" The crackle of those movies never breaks into this new one. ""Stardust"" looks drearily secondhand. The powers that shoot from Pfeiffers fingertips recall the ectoplasm from ""Ghostbusters."" So do a lot of the effects. When the camera can spin or swoop or whoosh it does which is to say its doing this for half the movie. The music is the sort of crashing stuff meant to signal action but for a lot of the movie it is the action. Are we supposed to be under a spell or under attack?The filmmakers go for the kinkiness and naughtiness in the book but dont know how naughty to be. Its as if the ribaldry has been focus-tested out. When Pfeiffers witch pretends to be an innkeeper to close in on Daness star she offers a massage which should be the years erotic high point. But that sequence is confused with jokey business. The movie isnt remotely as sardonic or irreverent as it so clearly wants to be. Pfeiffer playing her second shrew of the season looks like shes enjoying herself in a part that shows off her severe beauty and her comedic prowess but the role is a dud that seems borrowed from that Bette Midler Halloween turkey ""Hocus Pocus.""As the king OToole exits early which is lucky since his costume appeared to be devouring him anyway. Rupert Everett plays one of his sons defenestrated in the opening minutes. His punishment for an early escape is having to spend the rest of the movie sitting around as a member of the growing chorus of ghoulish dead princes in bleached-out special effects no less. (Wouldnt that have been the occasion for ectoplasm?)The movie goes right exactly once When De Niro shows up as a closet-case pirate for a series of daylight sequences aboard his floating ship. If ever there was an occasion for him to fax in a note saying the dog ate my performance this would be it. But surrounded by the exuberant bunch of actors playing his crew De Niro makes a macho-hammy-swishy mess of himself. (""Tres you"" he tells Cox). Hes terrible but hes having well a gay old time. Its contagious. When Danes is around him the pain in her smile is all gone.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

Now just simmer down and give it up all you proprietary fans of graphic novelist Neil Gaiman and surrender to cruel reality. With the release of ""The Princess Bride""-flavored ""Stardust"" the immensely winning and visually arresting adaptation of Gaimans 1998 fantasy the word is going to be out. ENLARGE Tristan (Charlie Cox) is a sweet diffident young man who as an infant was delivered to his father in a basket. (The lads true identity will come as a surprise only to those unfamiliar with the works of the Brothers Grimm Hans Christian Andersen or Walt Disney). Desperately in love with the indifferent Victoria (Sienna Miller) the prettiest and perhaps shallowest girl in their serene Victorian English village Tristan strikes a bargain If as a birthday gift he brings her the star that has just fallen Victoria will be his bride. To seal the deal Tristan must venture into Stormhold the enchanted kingdom just beyond the stone wall bordering his village. The bright particular fallen star hes after turns out to be embodied by a beautiful if rather petulant young woman who answers to Yvaine (Claire Danes channeling Gwyneth Paltrow). But this is a fallen star sought by many. The list includes dim-witted power-crazed princes of the realm and witches chief among them Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer here as in ""Hairspray"" wonderfully full of rage about her lost youth). One way or another the whole motley lot of them wants Yvaines heart. Those who like their fairy tales served up subversive -- or at the very least hip and self-referential like ""Shrek"" -- would do well to look elsewhere. The most ""Stardust"" supplies in this department is a hilarious Greek chorus made up of fallen heirs to the Stormhold throne and Robert De Niro as the fierce captain of a flying pirate ship whos leading a double life. With that armoire full of frocks and furbelows hes as much swish-buckling as swashbuckling. The considerable spell the movie casts is weakened by its length and sometimes scattershot approach. There are just a few too many incantations and transformations and the climactic scene is just this side of tedious. But these are quibbles. At its best ""Stardust"" shines bright. Rush Hour 3 Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker have been through a lot together. To be exact ""Rush Hour"" ""Rush Hour 2"" and now ""Rush Hour 3."" Are they tired? Perhaps not but their antics and action sequences certainly are. Like most other cop buddy movies the formulaic ""Rush Hour"" is built on the belief that opposites attract -- specifically that opposites attract audiences. Mr. Chan as Inspector Lee is the certified introvert the unflappable analytical half of the duo who lets his dazzling martial arts work do the talking. Meanwhile Mr. Tuckers officer James Carter is loud lewd bold and bumptious in his approach to the ladies and almost as bumbling as his fellow guardian of the law Inspector Clouseau. In ""Rush Hour 3"" as in ""Rush Hour 2"" Lee and Carter are up against Triad the pre-eminent crime syndicate in China one of whose members is Lees close childhood friend (Hiroyuki Sanada). To put a lid on murder and mayhem the two guardians of law and order must locate a mysterious list containing the names of the groups top thugs. The search involves a trip to Paris with stops at such tourist attractions as the Eiffel Tower the sewers a casino/house of ill repute and a cabaret styled on the Folies-Bergere where amusingly Messrs. Tucker and Chan cross cadenzas on the Roberta Flack-Donny Hathaway classic ""The Closer I Get to You."" Or perhaps it only seems amusing in comparison to a stop at a martial-arts school where the men offer up an offensive take on Abbot and Costellos classic ""Whos on First"" routine. Max von Sydow is on hand to play an eminence gris the sort of role reflexively handed over to Christopher Plummer. Perhaps hell turn up in ""Rush Hour 4."" Becoming Jane There is what amounts to a cottage industry of novelists who update or refashion the works of Jane Austen. ""The Jane Austen Book Club"" ""Jane Austen in Scarsdale"" ""Jane Austen in Boca"" ""Confessions of a Jane Austen Addict"" and ""Lost in Austen Create Your Own Jane Austen Adventure"" are but a few such titles. ENLARGE Anne Hathaway (shown here with James McAvoy left and Laurence Fox) plays the young Jane Austen in ""Becoming Jane."" Reimagining the life of Austen herself was perhaps the next logical step. Thus the heavy-handed fatuous ""Becoming Jane"" with the lovely Anne Hathaway doing the best she can in the title role. A letter from Austen to her sister mentions ""a gentlemanlike good-looking pleasant young man"" one Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy). According to Austen biographers he and Jane danced together at several balls flirted discussed the racy novel ""Tom Jones"" and perhaps even did a bit of canoodling. But Jane the daughter of an impecunious country rector had no dowry; Lefroy a prospective lawyer was expected to contribute to the support of his many siblings. Marriage then was an impossibility. Despite pangs the two parted. Jane never married. End of story. With plenty of Masterpiece Theatre filigree -- the wall-to-wall chamber music the bosky scenery the images of characters reflected in pretty ponds -- ""Becoming Jane"" takes that small undeniably tender interlude injects it with steroids (actually creates an elaborate fiction) and posits it as the defining event of the great novelists all-too-brief life. It surely could not have been the intention of the filmmakers to trivialize Austens art. But with myriad allusions to the novels -- the haughty neighborhood dowager (Maggie Smith looking like an aging madam) who recalls ""Pride and Prejudice""s Lady Catherine with one unsuitable suitor intoning ""Its a truth universally acknowledged..."" -- thats exactly what happens. Austen comes off here more as stenographer than writer. Worse the movie has Tom Lefroy as her condescending guide. If she wants to be a novelist she must learn about passion he says pointing her in the direction of ""Tom Jones."" Thank you kind sir.    DVD TIP Two sisters of vastly different temperaments (Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson) navigate the rough road to love and marriage in Ang Lees fetching take on Jane Austens ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995) with Ms. Thompson pulling double duty as star and screenwriter.

Its a question that doesnt really get answered in director Matthew Vaughns doggedly whimsical romantic fantasy because everybodys too busy with crazy witches gay buccaneers miniature elephants and magical unicorns to care. A mash-up of Tolkien the Grimms and Monty Python with a young lovestruck hero (Charlie Cox) and an otherworldly beauty (Claire Danes) traipsing around a magical alternate universe this unrestrained romp brings a bit of bawdiness to the too-precious precincts of the ""once upon a time"" fairy tale. But it also brings too much of everything to the table Its the cinema equivalent of a long winding run-on sentence. Adapted from the heavily illustrated Neil Gaiman novel (""a romance within the realms of faerie"" it says on the book jacket) Stardust begins with a teenage lad Tristran venturing beyond the quaint English town of Wall to retrieve a falling star for Victoria (the busy Sienna Miller) the girl he thinks he loves. This requires eluding an old crotchety guard and crossing a stone barrier into the forbidden woods (shades of M. Night Shyamalans The Village). Turns out though that the fallen star has metamorphosed into Claire Danes with blond highlights and a quasi-English accent. Her name is Yvaine and shes good with a sharp riposte as when Tristran explains why hes dragging her back to Wall to give to Victoria. ""Nothing says romance like the gift of a wounded captive woman"" quips Yvaine - and so the Renaissance Faire frisson between Tristran and Yvaine is established. It also turns out that Tristran is not the only one in search of this fallen-star-turned-femme. Theres a wicked hag (Michelle Pfeiffer seemingly single-handedly remaking The Witches of Eastwick) who will turn young again if she gets her hands on Yvaine. And then theres the business of royal successorship An ancient and dying Lord Stormhold (a cadaverous Peter OToole) has three living sons vying for the throne - not to mention four dead ones who reappear in ghostly fashion. Get your hands on the fallen star and the crown is yours they think. Director Vaughn whose sleek English crime pic Layer Cake introduced Daniel Craig to the world goes to altogether different places here. Long larky with gossamer visual effects and featuring a painfully prancing performance from Robert De Niro as a crossdressing pirate Stardust is vigorously over-the-top. Humble it is not. Stardust 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Matthew Vaughn. With Claire Danes Charlie Cox Sienna Miller Robert De Niro and Peter OToole. Distributed by Paramount Pictures.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor August 10 2007 Save for later Saved In ""Stardust"" based on the book by Neil Gaiman a Victorian village named Wall borders Stormhold a parallel universe kingdom. The division goes even further sequences in Wall are deliberately otherworldly while scenes in Stormhold are more realistic.The agenda is clear We are supposed to recognize the magical in the everyday and vice versa. Pulling this off requires a filmmaker with an extraordinary breadth of vision and Matthew Vaughn the director and co-writer isnt quite that.His previous experience is as a producer on gangster films such as ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" as well as directing one of his own ""Layer Cake."" These are not the credits you would expect from the director of a lyrical fantasia. It turns out that he is more comfortable with the magical than with the mundane and thats not all bad. Fantasy movies are often so gossamer thin that they float away while youre watching them. ""Stardust"" has a welcome heft. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Tristran Thorne (Charlie Cox) is a resourceful shop boy who promises the pretty Victoria (Sienna Miller) he will venture across the forbidden wall separating his village from its parallel world and bring her back a fallen star. It turns out the star is in fact the sylphlike Yvaine (Claire Danes) who doesnt want to be rescued. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 In other words theyre a love match and their initial hook-up is a fantasy movie version of meeting cute.Throughout their odyssey Tristran and Yvaine encounter a pageant of oddballs and connivers all of whom want something from Yvaine. Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) the witchiest of witches wants to cut out Yvaines heart in order to give herself the gift of everlasting life; a set of princes all contenders to the Stormhold throne of their ailing father (Peter OToole) scheme for the jewel around her neck that will ensure their ascendancy.Theres even a pirate Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Niro) who pilots a flying ship with a crew only slightly less scurvy than the one in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. Keith Richards played the father of Capt. Jack Sparrow in the last installment but it is Captain Shakespeare who cross-dresses in the privacy of his chambers who seems like Sparrows true patriarch. Watching De Niro sashay in tutu and corset is easily the most otherworldly sight in ""Stardust.""Although the captain does not appear in Gaimans novel he personifies the writers anything-goes spirit. (The script was co-written by Gaimans friend and associate Jane Goldman.) If the movie had been directed by Terry Gilliam - who reportedly turned it down because he was maxed out on fantasy films - it no doubt would have been more explosively imaginative. But then again Gilliams ""Time Bandits"" which Stardust pays homage to was also exhaustingly imaginative. Vaughns pokiness his less-than-visionary visuals can be rather pleasing. He doesnt try to wallop you with his genius and he works well with his actors.Danes doesnt quite fit into the mindscape - shes too bland for a human star - but Cox comes of age quite convincingly De Niro is a hoot as is Ricky Gervais as a slimy tradesman.Pfeiffer has a field day. Shes not merely channeling herself from ""Witches of Eastwick"" - or ""Hairspray"" for that matter. Her Lamia may be a dried-up crone but when she looks at her reflection and gasps in horror we gasp in sympathy. Nobody who once looked like Michelle Pfeiffer in her prime should be this shriveled. In moments like these Yvaines heart surely belongs in a better place.

"Twinkling Stardust washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Twinkling Stardust Michelle Pfeiffer plays the youth-obsessed witch Lamia and with veterans such as Peter OToole gives a jolt of energy to the film based on Neil Gaimans book. (Paramount Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 10 2007 Are you snapping out of your latest ""Harry Potter"" swoon? Do you desperately need a post-""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy fix? Has movie romance failed to measure up since ""The Princess Bride""? Then hie thee to ""Stardust"" a supernatural fantasy-action adventure whose combination of whimsy and gothic melodrama seems to have been cobbled together from focus groups held at Comic-Con and Renaissance fairs. Based on the graphic novel of the same name by Neil Gaiman ""Stardust"" has it all sweetness magic lusty wenches evil witches a swishy Robert De Niro. What it doesnt have is the tight focus and economy that seem to be lost values in todays Hollywood; overstuffed and overlong this is a movie made with the ""we paid for it were leaving it in"" ethic of CGI-driven filmmaking. The result is a decidedly mixed bag -- made of meticulously crafted Ye Olde English burlap mind you -- of delights digressions and outright puzzlements. Set in a tiny village of an indeterminate era ""Stardust"" tells the story of young Tristran (Charlie Cox) a humble shop boy who falls in love with the snooty Victoria (Sienna Miller) and vows to prove his love by fetching her a fallen star. His journey to fetch the astral trinket takes him beyond a magical wall that has forever separated his village (named Wall) from the magical kingdom of Stormhold. When he finds his quarry it turns out to be a young silver-gowned beauty named Yvaine (Claire Danes) who for reasons too convoluted to go into here is also being pursued by a wizened old witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) and the heirs to Stormholds throne. One of the chief aforementioned delights of ""Stardust"" which was directed by Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake"") is the 24-year-old Cox a relative newcomer who proves to be a terrifically appealing leading man. Starting out as a dorky milquetoast he made an extraordinarily convincing even sexy transformation into a swashbuckling macho hero. If Danes for her part generates little heat as she smiles and glows (literally) on cue Cox makes up for her bland presence to shine on his own without benefit of special effects. Even as ""Stardust"" lags under a surfeit of computer-generated green smoke and tricky effects (such as the merry band of ghosties who serve as a spectral chorus throughout the proceedings) it is shot through with wit and detail and the opulent costumes and settings that make such cinematic journeys worth the trip. From the cleverly designed buttons on the coat of a character named Septimus to the sweeping English landscape that serves as the storys enchanted backdrop ""Stardust"" offers the kind of vacation from everyday cares and logic that is supremely welcome during summers dog days. Pfeiffer as the youth-obsessed witch named Lamia takes winking command of a role in which she gets to resuscitate her images as a screen goddess then cruelly ages as spots sags and bags appear with unforgiving swiftness; its a performance that cant help remind viewers of the plight facing Pfeiffer and her fellow actresses of a certain age in Hollywood. But where such veterans as Pfeiffer and Peter OToole give ""Stardust"" a jolt of in-for-a-penny good humor Robert De Niros turn as Captain Shakespeare (dont ask me) a cross-dressing pirate isnt nearly as successful. During an interminable middle passage aboard Shakespeares flying ship the man known for playing such toughs as Jake La Motta and Jimmy Conway camps it up -- think less a riff on Keith Richards and more ""La Cage Aux Folles"" -- in a performance that can only be described as deranged. (The weird sequence does have a payoff however in the form of a briefly inspired verbal duet by Shakespeare and Ricky Gervaiss Ferdy the Fence.) Things finally come to a dramatic clattering end in ""Stardust"" which befitting of a fairy tale of its scope concludes with visual and melodramatic overkill. Larded with too much innuendo and adult humor to qualify as a kids movie too twee to be considered purely adult fare ""Stardust"" occupies that strange piece of middle earth reserved for grown-ups who crave the time and space to let their inner children come out and play. Stardust (128 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for fantasy violence and some risque humor.

Thats no surprise really Its co-creator Neil Gaiman is best known for his graphic novels such as the celebrated Sandman series and like many artists of that form what he conjures is the imaginative thrill of movement on the page -- a motion picture that plays out in your head in between the panels (or as in the case of Stardust the faux-Victorian illustrations). The paradox is that when a literary special-effects novel gets adapted for the screen the enchanted bits and pieces that were so ingeniously evocative of movies now just look like...standard derivative movie magic. In the film version of Stardust a sorceress waves her hand and -- poof -- a man dissolves into a cloud of blue pixie dust which fades away to reveal that he is now a mouse. The mottled wooden ship of a fearsome buccaneer played (with a few mincing surprises) by Robert De Niro sails through the air like a phantom galleon out of a Pirates of the Caribbean flick. There are ancient witchy sisters grouchy little men in leprechaun hats bolts of green fire and a shooting star that lands on Earth and literally turns into Yvaine (Claire Danes) a beauty who shimmers with a slightly cheesy halo glow. (Its like a 60s Disney effect and the dress shes wearing shines too Its silver-blue and looks like something Danes might choose for the Oscars.) There is also a trio of princes in stagy-looking beards who are trying to bump each other off as they compete to take over their late fathers throne (each time one of them is killed he joins the clans Beetlejuice gallery of wise-guy black-and-white ghosts); a romantic hero Tristan whos sweet and dashing in just nondescript enough a way to make you wonder whether Charlie Cox the actor playing him is a budding star or the next Orlando Bloom; and Michelle Pfeiffer as a 400-year-old crone ripely evil in her leprous plastic age makeup who wants to find Yvaine and cut out her heart thus giving herself a fresh jolt of youth. The name of this chararacter is not Witchiepoo but there are moments when Stardust resembles nothing so much as the worlds most deluxe episode of H.R. Pufnstuf. But only moments. The movie with its thrift-shop magic-wand conceits served up with an airy at times jokey whimsy evokes a hundred other things youve seen before but as co-written and directed by Matthew Vaughn (doing a 180 from the blood-soaked gangland trickery of his first film Layer Cake) its deftly put together with a story that in its secondhand way actually gathers steam and makes sense. Its the closest the movies have come in a while to the nudgy knowing fairy-tale enchantment of The Princess Bride. Stardust however will leave you with one nagging question Is this what Robert De Niro really thinks is meant by ""fairy tale""?

Based on Neil Gaimans illustrated novel ""Stardust"" aims for a ""Princess Bride"" mix of whimsy and wonderment the sardonic and the romantic with only sporadic success. Both visually and narratively cluttered the film diverts more than it enchants. Michelle Pfeiffer is fun as a witch hellbent on gaining immortality and Robert De Niro perks things up in a surprising turn as a pirate whos not what he seems. Vaughn who made the enjoyably tricky gangster movie ""Layer Cake"" gets points for ambition but this antic fantasy eludes his grasp. Becoming JaneDirected by Julian JarroldThis period romantic comedy imagines a love affair between 20-year-old Jane Austen (Anne Hathaway below) and dissolute but dreamy lawyer Tom Lefroy (the ubiquitous James McAvoy) that emulates the novels she would later write. ""Becoming Jane"" written by Sarah Williams and Kevin Hood proudly appropriates chunks of ""Pride and Prejudice"" ""Sense and Sensibility"" and the rest of Austens oeuvre into its plot which raises a question wouldnt we rather be watching the real thing? Jarrolds movie has charms but it has trouble finding its own voice until late in the game when Austens biography dictates an unmatrimonial final act. As the proud independent young author Hathaway is both subdued and alluring--its her most mature performance. The movie goes down easy but theres a thin line here is this an homage or a parasite?

"Stardust | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; stardust ) Stardust (United Kingdom/United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Stardust based on the acclaimed illustrated novel by Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess takes viewers to the mystical land of Stormhold where stars walk ships fly and magic is real. A fantasy in the tradition of The Princess Bride Stardust leavens its mature fairy tale with elements of romance horror and comedy. Theres less whimsy to be found here than in The Princess Bride but the film is likely to appeal to the same group of older children and adults that appreciated Rob Reiners classic. Stardust adopts its basic storyline from Gaiman and Vess beautifully rendered 1997 novel. Much has been changed and condensed but the essentials remain the same. Tristan (Charlie Cox) is a young Englishman who longs to win the hand of Victoria (Sienna Miller). She makes a bargain with him If he will bring her a shooting star fallen to Earth she will reject her other suitor in his favor. Tristan agrees and begins a journey across a mysterious wall and into the realm of Stormhold where magic holds sway. The fallen star Yvaine (Claire Danes) walks and talks and isnt happy about having been knocked out of the firmament. Tristan promises to find her a way home if she will accompany him to Victoria. But others are after Yvaine as well. The witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) wants to cut out her heart in order to gain eternal life and youth. And Septimus (Mark Strong) the heir to Stormholds throne needs a necklace Yvaine wears to finalize his coronation. Friends are few and far between but a reliable one is found in the person of the cross-dressing Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Niro) who commands a lightning-collecting airship. (The segment on his ship seems more like Time Bandits than The Princess Bride.) Although the film may appear at first glance to be a family film it contains enough content to make it a dubious choice for young children. There are sequences of mild horror in which characters die sometimes gruesomely. Some of the humor is also designed with an older audience in mind such as the cross-dressing and attitude of gay Captain Shakespeare. In the end this is very much a fairy tale in the truest sense of the term with plenty of the darkness left in that is often expunged from such stories. As a fantasy romance Stardust contains all the requisite elements true love mystical creatures magic-wielding harridans shape changing animals and a quest. The comedy is uneven. Some of it such as the bickering between the spectral brothers of Septimus or the antics of a billygoat-turned-human is worthy of a laugh or two. Other elements such as Captain Shakespeares over-the-top frolicking and dancing in womens clothing seems like it belongs in another movie (and in fact was not part of the book). The darker elements are nicely modulated. Theyre not graphic but they convey the point. The set design successfully replicates the look and feel of the book. Combined with Ian McKellans smooth narration Stardust transports viewers to another world. The special effects arent on the level of The Lord of the Rings but their application is sufficient to tell the story. Director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) put a lot of effort into making Stormhold into a traditional fantasy setting. (This incidentally is the movie that Vaughn elected to do instead of the third X-Men tale.) The cast is impressive and includes many luminaries from both sides of the Atlantic. The leads are played by a wonderful Claire Danes (using an effective British accent) who shines as a star and an understated and relatively unknown Charlie Cox. High-profile Americans include Robert De Niro who seems to be enjoying himself immensely and Michelle Pfeiffer who plays against character as an out-and-out villain. The U.K. contributes Rupert Everett Sienna Miller and Ricky Gervais in supporting roles. Then theres Peter OToole whose entire part consists of lying in bed dying. Those who have seen Venus will get the joke although I wonder whether Vaughn was in on it. The success of the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter movies have elevated fantasy from a niche film genre into the mainstream but Stardust is a little of a throwback to how fantasy movies used to be before the emergence of the multi-part epic serials. Its a lighter simpler sort of tale. Despite just cracking the two-hour barrier the film is paced and edited in such a way that the story always seems to be moving forward and there is no sense of drag or a letdown. Stardust isnt as visionary an accomplishment as this years bloody fantasy 300 but it nevertheless honors the illustrations that inspired its appearance. Its a kinder and gentler achievement but in the midst of overbudgeted over-hyped sequels its a fresh and welcome entertainment.

Everything but the enchanted kitchen sink shows up in the sprawling fairy tale ""Stardust"" including evil witches airborne pirate ships double-parked unicorns and Robert De Niro as a cross-dressing sea captain. Sprinkled with tongue-in-cheek humor fairly adult jokes and some well-known faces acting very silly this adventure story should have particular appeal to fans of ""The Princess Bride"" but in any event will never be mistaken for a strictly-for-kids movie. One of the opening scenes (there are several) involves the dubious conception of our hero Tristan Thorne (Charlie Cox) -- the collaborative effort of a witchs slave (Kate Magowan) and Tristans wall-jumping father (Ben Barnes). They live in Wall which separates England from the supernatural kingdom of Stormhold. There a battle for succession to the throne of the ailing king (Peter OToole) rages among seven princes only three of whom are left alive as the story begins. Theres a lot going on -- at times perhaps too much -- in ""Stardust"" which is based on the novel written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Charles Vess. The royal rivalries are raging; the dead princes who appear in black-and-white are a hilarious Greek chorus providing play-by-play on the homicidal antics of their surviving brothers. Meanwhile the young inept Tristan is wooing the fair Victoria (Sienna Miller) by telling her hell bring her the fallen star theyve seen pass over their heads. Then theres Yvaine (Claire Danes) who is the fallen star. And then theres Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) the evil witch who wants to cut out Yvaines still-beating heart and eat it with her horrid sisters so they can prolong their already unnatural youth. The best thing in the film Pfeiffer shows great comedic timing and her metamorphoses -- as Lamia careens from flourishing beauty to horrible crone -- show considerable courage as the actress manages to be funny regardless of what state of decrepitude shes in. Its not a very admirable character after all Lamia turns people into goats and goats into people and she and her sisters foretell the future by hacking up animals and reading their entrails. Theyre not the most in-demand dinner guests. Pic saves itself through a lot of incidental humor. Pfeiffer delivers elaborate well-timed eye-rolls when things like eternal youth dont go her way. De Niro whose Capt. Shakespeare is so swishy its amazing he doesnt go overboard (although he does in a sense) does a ""Can-Can"" fan dance that in terms of incongruous collisions of actor and role is equal to De Niros performance of ""I Feel Pretty"" in ""Analyze That."" The act doesnt have much to do with the ""Stardust"" story but its as engrossing as a car crash. Typical for a fantasy with love at the center the romance turns out to be the least interesting thing in the film. Tristan undergoes an extreme makeover over the course of the movie moving improbably from Edwardian nerd to Byronic swashbuckler; the fit is never quite right. Danes is outright cranky as Yvaine to the point where viewers may want to hand her over to Lamia. But the sweep of the story and the humor keep things on something of an even keel. Production values are good with the more obvious computer-manipulated moments not really distracting from the whole as the story and the characters are generally cartwheeling around reality anyway.
