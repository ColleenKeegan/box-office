The result A snip-snap film that plays like a political sitcom. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 21 2007 Save for later Saved The dreadful box office returns of this years major political movies - ""Rendition"" ""In the Valley of Elah"" ""Grace is Gone"" ""Redacted"" and ""Lions for Lambs"" - has convinced a lot of pundits that audiences are interested only in films that have nothing to do with todays wartime dispatches. But might the real reason for the turnout have more to do with the fact that these movies by and large are dismal?""Charlie Wilsons War"" is based on the George Criles nonfiction bestseller and stars Tom Hanks as the liberal Democratic Congressman from Texas who covertly helped fund the defeat of the Russians in Afghanistan in the wake of their 1979 invasion. Director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin clearly do not want to walk the same plank as those Iraq-themed films. As if in retaliation they have taken such a snippy-snappy approach to their subject that you almost feel as if youre watching a pilot to a new political sitcom.Sorkin of course created ""The West Wing"" and Nichols has ""Primary Colors"" on his resume. Well ""Primary Colors"" was no great shakes and the best of ""West Wing"" puts ""Charlie Wilsons War"" in the shade. Still its nice to watch a political movie that for a change isnt trying to save our souls. Its possible to have a good time with this movie while at the same time regretting all that it isnt. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? We first see Charlie cavorting with a couple of lovelies in a Las Vegas hot tub. But his attention is distracted by a nearby TV set broadcasting Dan Rather from Afghanistan. So here we have it in a nutshell Wilson is both a good time Charlie - his nickname on Capitol Hill - and a politico. The film follows him along the continuum from party animal to righteous crusader. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Hanks may at first seem like an unlikely choice to play a seasoned Texas playboy bachelor but hes so ingratiating that he almost pulls it off. Youre always aware of him giving a performance but then again Charlie Wilson was always putting on airs too. Actors love playing politicians because like it or not politicians are a species of actor.Charlies opposite number is Houston socialite Joanne Herring played by Julia Roberts in a wide accent and a big hairdo. Like Hanks shes not entirely believable either but she doesnt make the mistake of going all daffy on us. Joanne is a major power broker who because of her hatred of Communism gets her sometime lover Charlie to do what Congress wont - fund the mujahideen big time. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Wilson sets in motion a covert operation that raises over a billion dollars without ever letting either Congress or the public in on it.An indispensable ally in all this is Gust Avrakotos a blunt blue-collar Central Intelligence Agency officer played with such relish by Philip Seymour Hoffman that he swipes every scene hes in. (Gust has the best lines its true but Hoffman is such a marvel that Im convinced he could have stolen scenes from Olivier just by reading the phone book.) The yin-yang teamwork between Charlie and Gust is the movies wittiest and most heartfelt aspect. When these two are really humming theyre like a superhero duo cooked up by a precocious politics maven whos overdosed on ""Doonesbury.""The question is how seriously should we take ""Charlie Wilsons War."" As political history its negligent Charlie and Co. are such (covert) credit hogs that youd never know that Reagan or Gorbachev for that matter had anything to do with the fall of Communism. Its also a bit troubling that all this Capitol Hill covertness is celebrated without the slightest irony. And when irony finally rears its ugly head and we are informed that the freedom fighters of then are the terrorists of today its too little too late.The filmmakers just like everybody else he ever met have been seduced by good time Charlie and the seduction proves the films undoing. His saga only retains its full-throated black-comic force if viewed from the perspective of todays headlines. The way its been done here its a success story without a punch line.

True in his adaptation of George Criles best-selling true story Mike Nichols does allow Wilson a teary-eyed speech in a refugee camp on the need to invest in the post-bellum peace but its obvious that the director is more fully at home cheerleading the power-plays between the dapper congressman and Julia Roberts bouffanted right-wing Houston millionairess or keeping pace with the rattling parley in the corridors of Capitol Hill.As swish savvy and as self-entranced as Nichols earlier political satire Primary Colors Charlie Wilsons War is less afraid of exaggeration and extravagance allowing Philip Seymour Hoffmans seemingly bewigged CIA boffin a grandstanding introduction destroying his superiors glass office in petulance or indulging Hanks self-satisfied sexism to his little harem of jailbait secretaries.But if the films lack of real bite or requisite splashes of genuine acid keep it firmly in the limited bounds of slightly old-fashioned liberal hearted light comedy Aaron The West Wing Sorkins snappy sharp and sometimes sophisticated dialogue offers pleasures aplently the performances are likeable and entertaining while Nichols pumps the whole proceedings with a satisfyingly fluid dramatic energy.

Comic - yes in parts but easy laughs about the US congress and oneupmanship of the CIA man who knows his stuff better than his superior. Bland and predictable.

"Review Fun Wilsons at war -- with itself - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Fun Wilsons at war -- with itselfStory Highlights ""Charlie Wilsons War"" stars Tom Hanks as Texas congressman in 80s Hanks character manages to guide money to Afghanistan hurt Soviet Union Directed by Mike Nichols written by Aaron Sorkin film has hard time with tone Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Mike Nichols undercover history of the liberation of Afghanistan ""Charlie Wilsons War"" is so witty and light on its feet its a pity it pulls its punches. A society matron (Julia Roberts) gets a congressman (Tom Hanks) involved in the Cold War in ""Charlie Wilsons War."" A deft condensation of George Criles nonfiction best-seller this is the story of how an obscure Texan congressman helped bring down the Soviet empire and -- indirectly -- the World Trade Center. Universal seems at a loss as to how to market this truly tall tale -- but dont blame the publicity guys. The combined smarts of director Nichols writer Aaron Sorkin Tom Hanks and Co. havent pinned down how they feel about Wilson or what he did. The movies tone is all over the place sincere and celebratory one minute caustic and ironic the next. Theres nuance and complexity here but its doled out with broad farce and knee-jerk populist rhetoric. Its as if they want it to play inside the Beltway and hit below the belt both at once. Set during the Reagan era and resonating uneasily with current events in many ways this is a deeply Clintonian movie astute pragmatic equivocal and likely to prove highly contentious. (Thats what you get if you put the director of ""Primary Colors"" with the writer of ""The West Wing."") It is fun though. In that regard it could be the antidote to all those earnest war on terror pictures that have stiffed at the box office recently. Its certainly the anti-""Lions for Lambs"" See politics dont have to be boring. Especially if youre as politically incorrect as Charlie Wilson. He was dubbed ""Good Time Charlie"" for his compulsive drinking womanizing and fondness for cocaine (in a typically Clintonian gesture the movie acknowledges the latter but allows the congressman to keep his nose clean on screen). Booze sex and Texas doesnt exactly scream Hanks -- any more than evangelical society matron spells Julia Roberts -- but this odd casting gives Nichols elbow room to push out toward comic caricature and vaudeville which may be just what its Washington setting deserves. Watch the real-life inspiration for Roberts character >> The movie gets its biggest jolt from yet another bravura turn from Philip Seymour Hoffman -- his third of the current movie season -- as unconventional CIA agent Gust Avrakotos. With his dark glasses and bushy mustache Hoffman seems to have adopted a permanent disguise but he tells it like he sees it and mostly doesnt like what he sees. When we first see him he underlines a complaint by taking a hammer to his supervisors glass office. The films funniest scene is pure French farce an echo chamber of slamming doors as the congressman juggles a breaking ethics probe involving his secretarial pool (affectionately known as ""Jailbait"") while Gust gives him the inside dope on covert ops. Hanks brings a certain well-worn sophistication -- and impeccable timing -- to Charlies roguish ways. ""Why does Congress say one thing and do nothing?"" demands a fired-up Roberts. Hanks lets it sit there a beat. ""Tradition mostly."" Armed with a seat on the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee Wilson successfully upped covert CIA funding for the mujahedeen from 5 million in 1980 to 500 million by the end of the decade with matching money from Saudi Arabia and tacit support from Israel. The movie takes an indulgent view of this chicanery and Wilsons ""bring on the belly dancers"" approach to Middle Eastern diplomacy but its never quite so debonair on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan where Nichols seems to regress to a third-rate ""Rambo"" hack. Spry and droll for the most part ""Charlie Wilsons War"" cant quite shrug off the unforeseen repercussions of this triumphant episode. Wilson was a Democrat but thats neither here nor there; the system enabled him to funnel armaments to ""freedom fighters"" with next to no democratic accountability. Maybe it wasnt his fault those chickens came home to roost in the form of the Taliban but you have to wonder Would Nichols have given Oliver North such an easy ride?

Oscar winners Tom Hanks left as Congressman Charlie Wilson and Julia Roberts as socialite Joanne Herring tell the raucous true story of the largest covert operation in history in Charlie Wilsons War. Photo Universal Pictures Charlie Wilsons War 1 / 1 Back to Gallery This is an odd criticism for an armed conflict but Charlie Wilsons War runs half an hour short. Its fleet 97 minutes dig hard and fast into the story of the East Texas congressman who arranged American support for the mujahedeen during the Soviet-Afghan War - and the legendary Houston society dame who inveigled and persuaded him each step of the way. It is briskly paced nimbly acted and crisply directed by Mike Nichols (in his first pass at the American political arena since 1998s Primary Colors) from a screenplay by that grand pooh-bah of hyperdrive insider gabbing Aaron Sorkin. Nothing about it sags or wanes. But when it ends with the Afghan rebels triumphant over their Communist oppressors and Wilson being lauded by the intelligence community for his backdoor efforts pushing the largest covert operation in U.S. history the film leaves a whopper of an issue unexplored. In brief 9/11. What happened next in Afghanistan. How the United States lost hold. How the Taliban took power. How that country those freedom fighters turned our guns and good will against us after American money backed them in their fight against the Soviets. We get a scene showing Wilson as he argues to fund new Afghan schools and other post-war reconstruction. We read a closing quotation expressing his frustration that ``we (messed) up the end game. And then its over. Credits roll. History lesson finished. Except it isnt. Based on George Criles 2004 book of the same name Charlie Wilsons War doesnt pretend to tell the next part of the story - that isnt its intent. Its intent is to follow the money and the schmoozing with snappish wit and so it does. Criles account includes an epilogue titled Unintended Consequences that connects some of the dots between Wilsons war and al Qaidas but the movie doesnt go there. It doesnt approach that whole millennial nexus of religion and geography and blood. And thats strange because Nichols trusts his viewers enough not to mollycoddle them This is a smart movie directed at a smart audience. He should have trusted them even further. And he should have trusted history more. Fans of Sorkins work on The West Wing and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (but are there any? Studio 60 fans I mean?) will recognize the heavy emphasis on walking and talking most of which takes place in offices and corridors but can on special occasions move to exotic locales. Here they include Afghanistan Pakistan a Las Vegas hot tub and the River Oaks scene dominated by Wilsons friend and sometime lover Houston society doyenne Joanne Herring. Hanks Wilson comes across as a womanizing party animal yes but also a man of decency idealism and consummate plain-talk swagger. Roberts plays Herring as punctilious and swank - a born-again belle of the ball who targets ideas and people with surgical precision. Allusions to their on-off affair add spice to the byplay but it doesnt come off as gratuitous. Its just one saucy facet of a long-running collaboration. ``I want you to save Afghanistan for the Afghans she directs him touching up her lashes with a safety pin after a roll in the hay. The always-disconcerting Philip Seymour Hoffman turns in a gruff bit as the late Gust Avrakotos Wilsons ally and partner in the CIA and Ned Beatty floats in and out as Louisiana Congressman George ``Doc Long. Theyre just two more contributors to a good film with a good cast that stops 30 minutes shy of greatness. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Sperry Mens Baitfish Leather Flip Flops for 35 + free shipping Bass Pro Shops Beat the Heat Sale Deals from 2 + free...

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Congressman Charlie Wilsons undercover operation to support Afghan warlords against Russian aggressors in the 1980s was a classic story of good intentions backfiring. So is Mike Nichols film ""Charlie Wilsons War"" starring Tom Hanks as the politician who sped the collapse of the Soviet empire by arming the United States future jihadist enemies. The story with its cast of blinkered American do-gooders meddling in a Third World mess they dont fully comprehend is timely interesting stuff. But it cries out for the balance of satire and history lesson Philip Kaufman accomplished in his film of Tom Wolfes ""The Right Stuff"" and falls short. We meet Wilson a high-living staunchly anticommunist Democrat from East Texas in a Vegas casino fantasy suite hot tub with three naked models and enough booze and drugs to tranquilize a rhino. Hes roused from his shenanigans by a ""60 Minutes"" report from Afghanistan showing the locals shooting at armored Russian helicopter gunships with World War I vintage rifles. Wilson returns to Washington determined to supply the mujahedin rebels with modern weapons. When that proves impossible to accomplish above board he joins forces with power-broker Houston socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts all flash-frozen poise) and disgruntled working-class CIA agent Gust Avrakatos (rumpled mumbling Philip Seymour Hoffman) to get the job done. The film moves along smartly despite being stuffed to bursting with details of arms deals diplomatic ploys and political maneuvering. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had plenty of practice with this sort of snappy-jargon dialog on ""The West Wing"" and he keeps the momentum brisk while Nichols finds every excuse to cut from a policy-wonk dialogue to leering shots of a belly dancer or a congressional aide marching down a hall in a tight skirt. Roberts has her big moment here when she takes a phone call wearing a bikini lithe as a gazelle. Hanks is a performer of impressive range but hell never be convincing as a lech so the irony of Wilsons being appointed to the House Ethics Committee fizzles. His office is stocked with stunning assistants (including ""Enchanteds"" Amy Adams) and his banter with them percolates with good-old-boy sexism but theres no erotic electricity in the air. Even when sizzling-hot Emily Blunt strolls through his bachelor pad apartment half-undressed and settles into his lap the feeling is more sleep-over than sex spree. CHARLIE WILSONS WAR  out of 4 stars The setup In the 1980s a high-living congressman (Tom Hanks) a manipulative socialite (Julia Roberts) and a malcontent CIA agent (Philip Seymour Hoffman) join forces to supply arms to Afghan rebels fighting Soviet invaders. What works The story is a lucid stranger-than-fiction history lesson. What doesnt It hangs halfway between serious ""issue"" movie and satiric fling. Great scene Hoffmans first meeting with Hanks staged as a farcical cascade of interruptions with a dozen entrances and exits. Rating R for strong language nudity/sexual content and some drug use. On the other hand the scenes when Hanks regards suffering Afghan refugees with watering eyes or those where he trades buddy-movie one-liners with Hoffman work fine. At those moments the film is almost entertaining. ""Youre no James Bond"" Wilson tells the blue-collar spy. ""Youre no Thomas Jefferson"" Avrakatos retorts. And ""Charlie Wilsons War"" is no ""Wag the Dog.""

BY Jack Mathews Tuesday June 3 2008 329 PM Charlie Wilsons War. Political satire about a Texas congressman who turns the tide in the Afghan-Soviet war. With Tom Hanks Phillip Seymour Hoffman Julia Roberts. Director Mike Nichols (137). R Language sexuality/nudity drug use. At area theaters.Of all the Middle East-theme movies this season Mike Nichols ""Charlie Wilsons War"" is the least political and most entertaining. That doesnt mean its great just that its unimportant.""Charlie"" is a mannered star-studded Hollywood goof that just happens to be built around the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the successful insurgency of Afghan rebels funded by the United States - thanks to a playboy Texas congressman a skanky Lone Star socialite and a crusty CIA agent. Adapted from George Criles nonfiction book by ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin ""Charlie"" turns its serious subject into a laughing matter and recasts the books real-life characters as familiar Hollywood types - the kind of broad caricatures that earn their actors award nominations. Thus the Golden Globe nods last week for Tom Hanks who plays the title character the dreadfully miscast Julia Roberts as socialite Joan Herring and Philip Seymour Hoffman who as CIA agent Gust Avrakotos eats every scene he cant steal. The story being hammed up is fascinating. When the Soviets invaded the outmanned Afghanistan right-wing shaker Herring talked Congressman Charlie Wilson a friend and sometime lover into squeezing money out of a House subcommittee to fund black market arms for the Afghan resistance. Through the 1980s Charlie got the committee to pump increasing amounts of money into the operation and it paid off; the insurgents put the Soviets on the run. That those arms would end up in the hands of the Taliban is a note of irony barely mentioned in the film. As played by Hanks Charlie is an engaging colorful character an ethically challenged skirt-chasing alcoholic whose all-women Washington staff could have been recruited at a photo shoot for Sports Illustrateds swimsuit issue. If Charlie doesnt feel quite real Hanks at least makes him good company. Not so Roberts. The pretty woman can play a hooker as Cinderella but shes lost playing a genuine tramp.As for Hoffman who has multiple shots at Oscar nominations this year Sorkin lobbed him his best laugh lines and the actor effortlessly knocks them out of the park.

What will Hollywood think of next? Oscar winners Tom Hanks Julia Roberts Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mike Nichols with the help of ""West Wing"" scribe Aaron Sorkin find considerable laughter in this allegedly fact-based mission improbable. The action begins not in the Middle East but in a hot tub at a Las Vegas hotel in 1980 when Charlie Wilson (Hanks) a Texas congressman is diverted from his topless female companions by Dan Rathers famous in-mufti ""60 Minutes"" report from Afghanistan. Before you can say ""Whats the frequency Kenneth"" the liberal Wilson who chairs a key appropriations subcommittee is being wooed - in more ways than one - by Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts in big hair) a right-wing Texas heiress who hates the Russkies as much as Charlie does. With the help of a rogue CIA analyst named Gust Avrakotos (Hoffman) these unlikely allies (and occasional lovers though the stars have no chemistry) plot to secretly deliver a billion dollars worth of (highly illegal) weapons to the mujahadeen rebels. President Reagan you see couldnt officially ask for the money because of Iran-Contra among other reasons. Yes Charlie and Joanne make a secret trip to Afghanistan where they see horribly maimed children. But this is first and foremost a farce not unlike Nichols ""The Birdcage."" The funniest sequence has a bemused Gust being ushered in and out of Charlies office while the congressmans gorgeous all-female staff - headed by Amy Adams of ""Enchanted"" - is trying to spin a drug scandal involving the boss. The references to Charlies coke-sniffing and boozing were reportedly toned down in Sorkins zinger-filled script (""You can teach em to type but you cant teach em to grow t - - s"" Charlie says by way of explaining why a former Miss Cotton Bowl is his chief of staff). Sporting a truly frightening mustache and eyeball-gouging early 80s outfits Hoffman dominates his scenes left and right. At one point he secures rocket launchers for the Afghan rebels by putting together an Israeli intelligence officer and a supplier from Pakistan who are entertained by a belly dancer procured by Charlie. This credulity-straining if highly entertaining story - based on a book by the late CBS producer George Crile - is framed by a ceremony in which Wilson is credited with winning the Cold War and causing the fall of the USSR by funding the Russkies first and only defeat. (Reagans tacit support is not mentioned.) Things didnt turn out so well for Afghanistan of course. The film suggests this happened because Charlie somehow couldnt get a measly million-dollar appropriation for education through Congress. What a timid wimp-out for the liberal stars (Hanks has done nothing better since ""Castaway"") and filmmakers. Many of the US-funded weapons ended up in the hands of the Taliban - and this more or less directly led to 9/11 and the current war in Iraq. But that would make it a lot harder to laugh at ""Charlie Wilsons War"" which if you ask me is still a tough sell as holiday entertainment. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE CATCH Read Next BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE CATCH Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 24724 How Hillary blew her big moment 15238 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 10179 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Starring Tom Hanks Julia Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Directed by Mike Nichols. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""Charlie Wilsons War"" is a behind-the-scenes look into fairly recent history involving real characters who are still alive and who did important things. Written by Aaron Sorkin directed by Mike Nichols and based on a true story the film details the personalities and politics behind the U.S. governments covert aid to Afghan insurgents who fought and - thanks to Stinger missiles and anti-tank guns - defeated the Soviet Union. This clever and enjoyable film centers on Charlie Wilson a Democratic congressman from Texas whom we first meet snorting cocaine and soaking in a hot tub with strippers. Wilson a bachelor is a heavy drinker and a womanizer but hes not a simple hedonist. A rogue but an honest one he hides a serious streak underneath the good-time-Charlie exterior. In the beginning that means telling the strippers to be quiet when something interesting comes on the news. Later his seriousness leads him into more committed territory toward helping take down a totalitarian nightmare. The role of Charlie Wilson demands something different from Tom Hanks and he responds with among the best character work of his career. Its not his deepest or richest performance far from it but this film is the best argument yet for the notion that Hanks doesnt always have to play a version of himself. As Charlie Hanks gets to be sexier more wry more shrewd and in some ways more funny than he has ever been before onscreen. He creates a complete portrait of a distinctly Southwestern type that we immediately recognize and like. Sorkin writes great scenes and ""Charlie Wilsons War"" is about its script more than anything. Just as Wilson is introduced in the hot tub Philip Seymour Hoffman also gets a big entrance as CIA agent Gust Avrakotos telling off his boss and smashing the glass wall of his office. Avrakotos is a first-generation American rough around the edges who resents being passed over for promotion in favor of smoother white-bread types and when we meet him hes raving about not getting a promised position in the Helsinki bureau after having bothered to learn Finnish (one of the most difficult languages in the world). ""For the last 24 years people have been trying to kill me"" he says. ""People who know how."" That extra knowing detail - in this case the ""people who know how"" line - is what makes Sorkins scenes pop. Throughout theres the sense of seeing and hearing power in action and whether the film is accurate or not its convincing. Julia Roberts is Mrs. Herring a Christian conservative who hosts an event at her Texas home publicizing the plight of the Afghans. Because shes rich and a major donor Wilson has to attend. Because hes apparently irresistible they end up in bed - and discuss how to increase the budget for covert operations as he soaks in the bath. Though everything in the movie flows as easily as water downhill its striking how much technical detail Sorkin includes while seemingly giving us a series of breezy semi-comic scenes. Watching ""Charlie Wilsons War"" the viewer finds out how congressional appropriations are made what weapons are needed to take down tanks and helicopters how much that costs and how weapons can be funneled from Israel and Egypt into Pakistan. This is about the most effortless education in the realities of 1980s geopolitics that anyone could ever hope to get. Just two things are missing from the movie and theyre enough to keep it from greatness. Despite the grandeur of the story - Wilson and his colleagues really did do something amazing - theres little grandeur in the filmmaking save for a wonderful shot in which Wilson visits Afghan refugees and the camera pulls back to show that their makeshift camp goes on for miles and miles. Perhaps the glibness of the writing got in the directors way but it shouldnt have. The other thing missing is that for all his scene by scene brilliance Sorkin finds no overarching personal drama on which to hang the action. Peter Morgan found that (or simply imposed it) in his screenplay for ""The Queen"" so that a movie about the repercussions of Princess Dianas death was also very much about the relationship between Elizabeth II and Tony Blair. Theres nothing of comparable interest in ""Charlie Wilsons War"" no crucial interplay of personalities no combat between individuals of strong will. The relationship between Wilson and Herring seemed to have potential along that line but nothing dramatic happens between them. In a story about real people its sometimes hard to make things up. Still though not great ""Charlie Wilsons War"" is definitely worthwhile and entertaining and clocking in at a modest 98 minutes it doesnt overstay its welcome. -- Advisory This film contains strong language drug use sexual situations and graphic images of wounded people.

"Charlie Wilsons War Battle smarts | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCharlie Wilsons War Battle smarts Once lumped amongst the many 2007 movies themed on current Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts Charlie Wilsons War now looks to be the only film of the lot with a serious chance of attracting an audience.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 21 2007 Starring Tom Hanks Julia Roberts Philip Seymour Hoffman Amy Adams and Om Puri. Directed by Mike Nichols. 96 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Charlie Wilsons War amounts to accidental counter-programming for a battle-scarred box office.Article Continued BelowOnce lumped amongst the many 2007 movies themed on current Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts despite its early 1980s setting it now looks to be the only film of the lot with a serious chance of attracting an audience.Thats because its the only one that seeks to entertain rather than preach and it crucially shows America actually winning on the world stage even if the victory is only temporary.Casting is another big plus. As the titular Charlie Wilson an East Texas congressman with a yen for booze and babes a flair for deals and a determination to help outflanked Afghans beat invading Russians Tom Hanks delivers another of his patented good-guy roles.Few actors could make a hero out of Wilson an alcoholic hedonist who loves to cavort in hot tubs with coke-blowing strippers.Hanks is buttressed by female stereotypes played well by capable actors Julia Roberts as foxy Texas zillionaire Joanne Herring who loves God and sex but hates Communists; and Amy Adams as Wilsons loyal assistant Bonnie who disapproves of Charlies skirt-chasing ways but loves him anyway for his boyish zeal.The films secret weapon in the acting department though is Philip Seymour Hoffman in the role of profane and rebellious CIA op Gust Avrakotos who doesnt suffer fools and speaks his mind even when it hurts.Hes the brains of the Afghan relief operation which must be conducted in Cold War secrecy to avoid inflaming both peacenik Americans (they were accused of being ""fence sitters"" back then) and suspicious Russians. But Wilson is the heart and soul of these covert ops the guy who can sweet-talk billions of dollars out of Congress from his perch on the Defence Appropriation Subcommittee.Director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (The West Wing) know how to tell a good story and this one crackles with wit and insight. They pare down George Criles eponymous bestseller about how Democrat Wilson and his cohorts cooked up a brazen plan to smuggle cash and weapons to Afghan Mujahideen warriors right under the nose of Republican president Ronald Reagan (who is mentioned but not seen in the film).But they dont dumb the story down. This is adult comedy in the best sense requiring you to know a little bit about history and also the rough-and-tumble workings of politics. Nichols and Sorkin move briskly through scenes in Washington Afghanistan Saudi Arabia Israel and Pakistan doling out exposition on the fly and requiring the viewer to stay alert to changing elements of the slippery deal.Watch out for Bollywood pro Om Puri in the role of Pakistani President Zia who is wise enough to look past good-time Charlies bad habits and Ken Stott as Israeli weapons dealer Zvi who must overcome his suspicion of Arabs to do the right thing.At a brisk 96 minutes Charlie Wilsons War seems also too short. The film ends abruptly with a note from the real Charlie Wilson that no matter what good was accomplished 25 years ago ""we f---ed up the endgame"" by allowing Al-Qaeda to take root in Afghanistan and undo much goodwill towards Americans.Its a rare moment of preachiness in a movie that pours its messages like Charlies Chivas Regal but it does point to the current global problems that have both Washington and Hollywood flummoxed.Read more about AfghanistanThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    23degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Take today. Two very different films about Afghanistan open. Marc Forsters much-awaited adaptation of ""The Kite Runner"" tells the story of Afghan life and tribal strife through the unraveling friendship of two boys separated first by a lie and then by the 1979 invasion of their country by the Soviet Union. 1/2 RATING | Political Dramedy Mike Nichols highly entertaining -- and mildly uncomfortable -- political dramedy ""Charlie Wilsons War"" also deals with that war. The first film attempts to reveal the souls of Afghans. The second may be about freedom fighters confronting the Red Army but its all American. One reason is because ""War"" does the Hollywood thing of putting quasars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts on the same screen for the first time. A more significant reason is that this character-driven pleasure cant help but celebrate Americans rogue tendencies and impulsive decency our love of the rule of the law and our fondness for making an end-run around it. Theres a reason we find U.S. Rep. Charlie Wilson of Texas 2nd Congressional District in a hot tub in 1980 where wheeling dealing and illicit imbibing are taking place. While flirting and drinking Wilson looks up to see Dan Rather on a TV screen decked out in rebel garb reporting from Afghanistan. Politically deft writer Aaron Sorkin adapted George Criles 2003 investigative yarn about the efforts of Wilson and CIA operative Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to fund and arm the mujahedeen. A Denver Post review of Criles book observed ""It would be overstating the case to say this unlikely pair was solely responsible for the massive escalation of aid to the Afghan rebels."" Lets just say the movie overstates the case. It also makes us wonder What is trenchant comedy if not overstatement and acute observation? Nichols and his crew pursue Criles conceit full throttle. Roberts brings political and romantic frisson as deep- pocketbook Texas socialite Joanna Herring Wilsons sometime paramour and a full-time Cold Warrior. Hanks brings understated smarts and a relaxed gusto to his role. Wilson is easy to like. Hes also tricky to peg. An office visit by a Bible- thumping constituent and his daughter (Emily Brunt) provides a lesson in Wilsons agile version of political two- stepping. He sure knows how to lead. Being fond of the guy means traversing vast ethically gray terrain. The same goes for Hoffmans CIA agent. Avrakotos is brilliant and no doubt lethal. Thanks to Hoffmans gruff authenticity he is also the most asocial protagonist youre likely to be mesmerized by this season. Local girl making very very good is Amy Adams who does a nice turn as Wilsons assistant Bonnie Bach. In an office populated by shapely assistants (yes they were referred to as Charlies Angels) she looks just as good in a skirt as her namesakes but also proves to be a working moral compass. When she accompanies Wilson to a crowded refugee camp in Pakistan her expression is as much a study in personal-political transformation as that of her boss. Which brings us back to that matter of weird timing. If youre curious about the lives of others consider ""The Kite Runner."" If you want to see how those lives became catalysts for an engagement in a region that continues to define American ideals -- both honorable and misguided -- then this fleet film should do the trick.

(UNIVERSAL PICTURES VIA BLOOMBERG NEWS) Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / December 21 2007 Tom Hanks Julia Roberts Mike Nichols and Aaron Sorkin want us to forget about ""Rendition"" and ""Redacted"" and ""Lions for Lambs."" Entertainment and foreign affairs do mix. Theyve made a movie that strains to prove it. ""Charlie Wilsons War"" brings us the true-life tale of a Democratic congressman from Texas played by Hanks who concocted a covert operation to arm Afghanistans mujahideen during the Russian invasion. Roberts has a ball playing a slatternly socialite and we have a ball watching Philip Seymour Hoffman as a coarse CIA agent. What sounds heavy feels unbearably light. Picture ""The Birdcage"" with shoulder-guided rocket launchers.Im only half-complaining. ""Charlie Wilsons War"" sure beats the series of lectures position papers and political tracts weve been getting all year - urgently concerned anti-entertainments from people like Robert Redford. This movie directed by Nichols from Sorkins screenplay is in its way an apolitical comedy about politics. Or at least a naive one since those weapons likely eventually made their way into the hands of Al Qaeda.This movie too takes a position Forget Oliver North come admire the brave liberal who helped the Afghan people defend themselves against those nasty Soviets. But when its not jaunting off to refugee camps in Peshawar to jerk our tears the movie Nichols has made is an amusing bauble that accessorizes perfectly with his other issue movies.As Wilson Hanks gives the part a honeyed drawl and an active intelligence youd have to squint to detect. Wilson is somewhat shrewd and somewhat clueless but inexplicably attractive and expectedly smooth. He likes to party (we meet him soaking in a Vegas hot tub with some strippers) and he enjoys the perquisites of government. His office is the best of both worlds. In a ludicrous mock-chauvinist joke four of Wilsons staffers are chesty big-haired broads (the credits call them ""Charlies Angels"") but theyre capable maybe even smart. Watching them band together to make their bosss drug scandal vanish is like watching spin-doctor night at Hooters. (The splendors of Amy Adams go wasted. As Wilsons prim chief of staff shes not in on many gags.)We know Charlie Wilson is to be taken only semi-seriously when he looks up from that Vegas Jacuzzi sees Dan Rather reporting on the mujahideen for ""60 Minutes"" and falls instantly in love with the Afghan cause. Ah screenwriting. Eventually he makes an ass of himself while trying to cut a deal with Pakistans military dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (Om Puri) and in a funny sequence brokering an arms deal between Israel and its enemies in front of a belly dancer.Based on the late CBS News correspondent George Criles book about Wilson Sorkins script relies on political-comedic oversimplifications that are meant to push the story along. As with Sorkins better TV writing this tale has a slick surface that Nichols and the actors have a good time treading. Hoffman is especially terrific playing the miserable petulant hideously coiffed fed who really knows Afghanistan. The movie is more or less his. Roberts is more problematic. She shows up as Joanne Herring the Houston socialite who lets Wilson make love to her (we see only the postcoital talk). She wants him to bring down the commies in Afghanistan and uses her impressive international connections to him help do it. Roberts has big blond hair an accent as thick as her mascara and poufy dresses that might as well have been sewn with yeast.She and Hanks have the delicious movie-star click youd expect. But she looks a half-century too young for a part that seems to cry out for Elaine Stritch and Joannes righteousness helps sour a movie that didnt seem to know what to make of her in the first place. Shes a grandstanding Christian know-it-all whose contradictions (""I talk about God for one reason. We need Him on our side"") seem lost on her. In one of the most depressing moments in the movie she walks by Charlies Angels and hisses at them ""Sluts.""That moment is typical of the kind of farrago ""Charlie Wilsons War"" is. In the name of entertainment it wants to moralize its pleasures away. Lest we forget this is about suffering too the movie shows Wilson at that refugee camp being visibly moved by the amputees and burn victims and starving Afghans begging for rations. Then we get a shot of tents that stretch on for as far as the eye can see (this is one of Nicholss ugliest-looking films).After that trip to Peshawar suddenly nothing is that fun anymore even as Hanks begins to lace the character with Clintonian absurdity such as Wilsons explanation of how he fell in love with America after he could manipulate voters (who happened to be black). The mix of ribaldry sex war and humanitarianism feels unseemly. Never more so than when a shot of an Afghan village littered with the charred debris of an exploded Russian helicopter is chased with a shot that lewdly rises up Amy Adamss hind parts. Thematically this movie is as promiscuous as Wilson.Its hard to leave ""Charlie Wilsons War"" without feeling queasy. Contrary to what Sorkin and Nichols seem to think the problem is not that topicality and entertainment dont mix. Its that audacity and self-congratulation dont. See we made an important movie that doesnt feel important the filmmakers seem to say. We made you think but we also made you laugh. To that end the movie is sandwiched by a runny awards ceremony honoring Wilsons daring. You would be forgiven for thinking its the Oscars.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

By now most audiences know the provenance of the meat and the gist of the ghastly story which remains intact; this is not a revisionist plot in which the Demon Barber of Fleet Street invents the safety razor. For the most part though the machinery of Mr. Burtons production grinds exceedingly fine. He and his screenwriter John Logan have turned the darkly comical Broadway musical into an elegant horror film starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter that takes pleasure in its own theatricality gives pleasure with caustic wit trusts the power of Stephen Sondheims score and exults in flights of fancy that only a movie can provide. ENLARGE One of those flights arrives early when Sweeney a grim revenant bent on revenge sings the chilling Sondheim song about a hole in the world. To make Sweeneys point the camera darts and scurries through the Victorian streets of a rat-infested London thats sinister enough to qualify as a civic black hole. Johnny Depps performance defines the title role for a new generation. Is there another contemporary actor who could have summoned up so much malevolence in such blithely minimalist style? If so his name doesnt come to mind. Mr. Depp sings well though hes obviously no Broadway baritone projecting to the third balcony and he succeeds at the improbable but essential task of making his tortured slaughterer sympathetic. ENLARGE Brash barber Johnny Depp as Sweeney Todd Another marvelous set piece turns on comedy. Its the one that introduces Helena Bonham Carters heedlessly unhygienic pie maker Nellie Lovett and that ends with Mrs. Lovett terminating a bugs life with a rolling pin. A comic spirit is indispensable to any production of ""Sweeney Todd"" but especially to this one since Mr. Burton a filmmaker not known to blanch at the sight of blood dispenses it with stunning gusto in great arterial spurts. That spirit is embodied not only by the delightfully raffish Mrs. Lovett a hollow-eyed rag doll with a rats nest hairdo (who knew Ms. Bonham Carter had a great song-and-dance-womans sense of timing?) but by Sacha Baron Cohens sensationally funny Pirelli a faker peddling a miracle elixir. The rest of the cast is no less expert or enjoyable Alan Rickman as the vile Judge Turpin; Timothy Spall as Turpins even viler enforcer Beadle Bamford; Edward Sanders as Toby Pirellis former assistant; Jayne Wisener as Johanna Sweeneys long-lost daughter. And distinguished work has been done by Mr. Burtons collaborators -- the cinematographer Dariusz Wolski the production designer Dante Ferretti; the costume designer Colleen Atwood the editor Chris Lebenzon. But then this film is of an artistic piece a vision of derangement and the seedbed of evil in which it grew. I wouldnt have said that of the theater productions Ive seen even though the show has been widely admired and endlessly celebrated since it opened on Broadway almost three decades ago; Sweeneys wildly joyous throat-slashings on stage always struck me as self-conscious and slightly silly. And if truth be told I tuned out of the screen version during one stretch of serial killings that finally gives way not a moment too soon to Mrs. Lovetts radiant fantasy of her life with Sweeney Todd by the beautiful sea. That was the only real lapse though. For the most part tune-outs are impossible. Like Sweeney with his razor Tim Burtons movie grabs you and wont let go. The Water Horse ""The Water Horse Legend of the Deep"" doesnt open until Christmas day but this lovely fantasy adventure may well figure in your plans for family entertainment. The creature of the title hatched from a magic egg is offered in all unseriousness as the explanation of Nessie the Loch Ness monster. Thats one of the films many endearing qualities. It declines to take itself seriously yet manages sometimes simultaneously to be exciting instructive cheerfully absurd and genuinely affecting. The setting is Scotland several years into World War II though most of the movie with its crucially wonderful creature effects was made in New Zealand. The story is yet another variation on a boy and his dog or a boy and his E.T. (Or in a Kiwi context a girl and her whale.) The boy Angus MacMorrow is played with uncanny grace by 13-year-old Alex Etel; he gave a similarly luminous performance three years ago in Danny Boyles ""Millions."" The strong supporting cast includes Ben Chaplin who has never been better and Emily Watson. ENLARGE Boy and horse Alex Etel in The Water Horse Legend of the Deep Angus knows his beloved father wont return from the war but knowing is one thing and acknowledging is another so its fortunate that the lonely boy finds the magic egg then befriends its emergent contents a hatchling he calls Crusoe. The little chick is charmingly clownish at first -- he has trouble distinguishing between a teddy bear and a dangerously live bulldog named Churchill -- but Crusoe grows by squirms and bounds into a leviathan supposedly celebrated in Celtic legend. (The movie comes by its animals honestly. It was directed by Jay Russell who did ""My Dog Skip"" and adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from a book by Dick King-Smith the creator of Babe the talking pig.) ""The Water Horse"" isnt perfect and its connection to Nessie is a shaggy dog story unto itself. But worthwhile family films are in short supply and this one isnt just worthy its alive. Charlie Wilsons War ""Charlie Wilsons War"" was directed by Mike Nichols from a script that Aaron Sorkin adapted from the book by George Crile. On the star-studded face of it this film is what thoughtful audiences should welcome -- a smart political comedy with the additional advantages of being significant and based on fact or at least on a best-seller by an author with strong journalistic credentials. And welcomed it may be but not by me. I didnt believe a bit of it thanks to the movies style except for some newsreel and documentary footage and even that felt epoxied on. Film Clips ""Sweeny Todd"" ""The Water Horse"" ""Charlie Wilsons War"" Tom Hanks plays Charlie Wilson the flamboyant Texas Democrat who as a member of a congressional appropriations subcommittee in the 1980s organized what was then the biggest covert operation in C.I.A. history -- channeling billions of dollars to the ultimately successful mujahedeen rebellion against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Julia Roberts is Joanne Herring a fervent anti-communist and one of the wealthiest women in Texas. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is agent Gust Avrokotos who was seen as a misfit by the C.I.A. but proved a master at implementing Wilsons war. Its a fascinating story but Mr. Nichols and his actors never stop reminding us how fascinating it is. With the exception of Mr. Hoffman a master of understatement everyone acts up a storm yet context is lacking -- no mention of the Taliban that flourished in the wake of Wilsons war not even a clear reference though I might have missed it to Wilsons party affiliation. Maybe the worry about that was losing GOP votes at the box office.    DVD TIP How long has it been since you last saw ""Beetlejuice""? If several years have drifted by it may be time to check out Tim Burtons 1988 ghost story again. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are newlyweds killed in a freak accident. Jeffrey Jones Catherine OHara and Winona Ryder are the yuppie parents and bleak-faced daughter who move into the newly dead newlyweds house and Michael Keaton is the majestically gonzo ghost who haunts it.

Life was simpler spirits higher everyone walked with a jauntier step. Or so it seems anyway in Charlie Wilsons War Mike Nichols fleet-footed look back at the Washington of the Carter and Reagan years and to the true-life political shenanigans of one Charles Nesbitt Wilson (Tom Hanks) a Texas congressman who orchestrated one of the largest covert operations in U.S. history - funding rebel fighters in their quest to send the Soviet Army packing from Afghanistan. A party-hardy bachelor whose congressional staff looked like they just popped over from Hefs mansion Wilson used his position on two key House subcommittees (defense and intelligence) to boost the CIA budget for arms and training for the mujaheddin guerrillas in the Soviet-Afghan war. He did this say Nichols and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (using the book by George Crile) pretty much unbeknownst to his colleagues in Congress. Starting with a paltry few million easily hidden in ""black appropriations"" Wilson through the 80s boosted his secret budget to 300 million - enough to pay for state-of-the-art rocket launchers able to shoot down Soviet helicopters. Charlie Wilsons War tells its tale briskly almost merrily. This is not a sober history lesson but a political comedy laced with sex (party girls in limos strippers in hot tubs) booze and even good old-fashioned cocaine. Hanks sporting a Texas twang and some kind of pre-John Edwards haircut swirls his Scotch yanks his suspenders and sails smoothly through the back-room horse-trading and Pentagon hugger-mugger. Capping a pretty impressive movie year Philip Seymour Hoffman (see him in Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead see him in The Savages) chews the scenery the screenplay and then some as Gust Avrakotos the CIAs Afghan desk guy - and a profane nutball is he. Its a small role with a couple of big speeches and Hoffman makes the most of em. Julia Roberts likewise shines as a Houston society swell whose improbable - and amorous - alliance with Wilson served them both well. And served the Afghan rebels even better. Like Sorkins D.C.-set TV series West Wing his script for Charlie Wilsons War is full of rapid-fire badinage with movers and shakers moving smart and shaking snappy as a squad of aides trot along behind briefcases and coffee cups in tow. A decade - not to mention a war - never went by so quickly. Charlie Wilsons War  (out of four stars) Directed by Mike Nichols. With Amy Adams Tom Hanks Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julia Roberts.

"Charlie Wilson Firing on All Cylinders washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments Charlie Wilson Firing on All Cylinders Network News X Profile View More Activity Play Video TRAILER | Charlie Wilsons War TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 21 2007 Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Wilson went to Washington full of high ideals committed to progressivism and the little guy. But Mr. Smith became an icon of idealism so pure that it had to be movie-phony. Mr. Wilson dated beautiful babes hung out in Vegas loved his daily glasses of amber beverage on the rocks had an all-female office staff with the biggest collective bust measurement on the Hill and destroyed the Soviet empire. This StoryMy travels with Charlie WilsonCharlie Wilson 76 Led U.S. support of Afghan uprisingCharlie Wilson Firing on All Cylinders Thus ""Charlie Wilsons War"" Mike Nicholss laff-a-minute chronicle of the congressmans crusade to ram funding through the House Appropriations Committee to supply arms -- notably ground-to-air missiles -- to the Afghani mujaheddin. He succeeded and the Russian warbirds began falling from the skies crashing burning and all but ending the Soviet occupation. Its also possible -- opinions vary -- that this development set into action internal vibrations that brought a lot of walls tumbling down. Was what came afterward better or worse? Well never know. This movie probably gets the Washington process better than any since Otto Premingers underrated ""Advise and Consent"" back in 1962. Its not about men of virtue doing the impossible but men of flaws doing the doable but just barely. You dont want to look too carefully at the process which is haphazard greased by alcohol and a barter system of favors and flattery big moneybags in the home state and a lot of gumption and git-er-done ingenuity. Charlie a multi-term Democrat from rural Texas who was a low-ranking grad of the Naval Academy is played by Tom Hanks at his unchallenged but affable best. This may be a first I would gauge Hanks as actually much less attractive than Wilson a notorious roue and ladies man. In several of its tropes ""Charlie Wilsons War"" turns on Charlies charms with the opposite sex. Too bad they didnt make the movie when authentic Texan Sam Elliott was younger; with his drawl his languid charm his dark piercing eyes hed have made a far more convincing Charlie than does Hanks and you wouldnt be left with the occasional curiosity as to why she -- this could be any of several shes -- seems so attracted to Forrest Gump. But the best thing about the film is the speed at which Nichols the director from Aaron Sorkins snarky script moves the thing along and keeps the cracks wise. In fact the best relationship in the film isnt sexually driven its banter-driven the weird chemistry between Charlie and CIA field agent Gust Avrakotos an oddball Greek American with shrewd street wiles (""Ive been targeted for 25 years for death by people who know what theyre doing""). Avrakotos is played in high brio by Philip Seymour Hoffman who is terrific as he almost always is. And the movie is calibrated to give him some big moments his explosion at a pea-brained superior in agency headquarters is probably too cute and clever to have happened that way in real life but its a tour de force of comic acting. Nichols is such an old pro that he keeps everything just flying along. In part the film seems almost like a Howard Hawks film with fast clever banter between antagonists and odd turns of event. Its almost like a remake of ""I Was a Male War Bride"" only this time under the title ""I Was a Male War Midwife"" for thats exactly what Charlie is. The movie from George Criles bestseller of the same name begins with Charlie in a Las Vegas hot tub among naked women champagne cocaine and other signals of high decadence. Hes watching ""60 Minutes"" and catches a Dan Rather report on the struggling mujaheddin in the then-backwater of rugged far-off Afghanistan. He is shocked to discover how little the United States is doing to help the guerrillas. The movie then follows Charlie on the road to Damascus -- well Kabul -- as he is converted from go-along-to-get-along libertine to shrewd committed political warrior horse-trading soothing cajoling and brokering arms deals between sworn enemies as the CIA clandestine budget for this patch of mountain and desert in Central Asia goes from 5 million to 80 million a year. Much of this money went to Stingers hand-held anti-aircraft missiles that cost 70000 apiece and knocked down devil machines worth millions. Nichols who directed ""The Graduate"" 40 years ago knows devil machines when he sees them. And rather than overdo the scenes of starving refugees with their double-amputee kids -- you cant have too many scenes like that in the same movie with naked congressmen in hot tubs -- he demonizes his enemy not as man but as vehicle. This is the awesome Soviet Mi-24 Hind helicopter with its insectoid complexity its hives of gun barrels and rocket launchers under the stubby wings and its multi-step series of cockpits. Nichols doesnt bother to characterize the Soviet aviators or to conjure up an evil harsh-faced Red Colonel that staple of 50s agitprop but he eavesdrops twice in pre- and post-Stinger days on the cockpit chatter. The first instance displays ho-hum pros going about the dreary business of cleansing the landscape of running peasants. The choppers are like the Death Star awesome in the firepower they bring to bear on the virtually defenseless. They hover or leap they chase and dart agilely and wherever they spot life they extinguish it with fusillades of auto-cannon fire or rocket barrages. Thus its so nice when chatting banally about love affairs in the bland affectless voices of the truly disinterested they notice the first Stinger vectoring up to resolve them into fire and ash. Gosh does this movie have it all or what? Smart dialogue Julia Roberts (in a smallish role as a wealthy patroness of both Charlie and free Afghanistan) in a bikini and looking grrrrrr-eattttt and Russian helicopters going boom Its also short Whats not to love? Charlie Wilsons War (96 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong language sexual content and nudity. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2007 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  My travels with Charlie Wilson Led U.S. support of Afghan uprising Charlie Wilson Firing on All Cylinders",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/20/AR2007122002416.html,200,charliewilson'swar25,charliewilson'swar,washingtonpost
"Movie review Charlie Wilsons War romps through the Cold War - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeMovie review Charlie Wilsons War romps through the Cold WarTom Hanks Juila Roberts star as pair of globe-trotting rogues who just happen to arm afghans undermine sovietsBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 12/19/2007 012321 PM PSTUpdated 12/20/2007 051935 PM PSTClick photo to enlargeTom Hanks as Charlie Wilson left and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Gust Avrakotos in a scene from ""Charlie Wilsons War.""<<12>> When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979 the foxhole from which resistance seemed least likely was a Las Vegas hot tub occupied by one naked United States congressman (Charlie Wilson D-Texas) and several equally naked women (C-Cups). This was typical of the congressmans interest in caucusing until the cows came home and in ""Charlie Wilsons War"" he doesnt just mix politics and pleasure. For him the two are inseparable. So no matter whats bubbling just beneath the surface of that Jacuzzi Wilson (Tom Hanks) is focusing his undivided attention on a ""60 Minutes"" story about the mujahedeen insurgents in Afghanistan. The rebels are being interviewed on television by Dan Rather who later would be derisively nicknamed ""Gunga Dan"" for wearing the headgear of the Afghan tribesmen. Even though Wilson isnt wearing any gear as this opening scene plays out his commitment to the cause of the overmatched mujahedeen will soon exceed not only Gunga Dans but that of the entire U.S. government including Ronald Reagan the president who would later receive most of the credit for bringing down the Soviets ""evil empire."" If you believe even a little bit of this remarkably clever movie Reagan got a lot of help from good-time Charlie. And ""Charlie Wilsons War"" which is that rarest of all Hollywood commodities - a sophisticated adult comedy - is helped immeasurably by cracking good performances from its three main players Hanks Julia Roberts and most especially Philip Seymour Hoffman.Advertisement When the scene shifts from Vegas to Wilsons Capitol Hill office the plunging necklines and silky tresses of an all-female staff makes it look like the bunny hutch at the Playboy mansion. Wilson who refers to one lethally young staffer as ""Jail Bait"" appears to have assembled the first coalition of the willing. For all the unreconstructed frat boy charm of its hero the movie doesnt really stand up on its hind legs and bark until Hoffmans arrival as embittered CIA analyst Gust Avrakotos. He spends most of the movie telling people higher up the chain of command that theyre idiots and during their first meeting he doesnt spare Wilson. The congressman has used his position on an influential committee to increase the funding for covert operations in Afghanistan and now Joanne Herring (Roberts) a bossy blond Houston socialite who is both a rabid right-wing anti-communist and one of Wilsons occasional girlfriends wants him to show her what hes really got. Using her feminine wiles and a clear vision of the future that includes bringing down the Soviet empire and ending the Cold War she dispatches Wilson to Pakistan to meet with President Zia (Om Puri) who also tells him hes an idiot. Wilsons Afghan operation is launched in the teeth of a criminal investigation into his possible use of drugs in that Vegas hot tub. This doesnt quite rise to the level of a subplot just an amusing distraction to remind us that Charlie isnt a guy who takes himself too seriously. It also allows the movies director Mike Nichols to keep reassembling Wilsons crisis-hardened staff led by lissome redhead Bonnie Bach (Amy Adams of ""Enchanted"") for whirlwind meetings that have the feel of an old Preston Sturges movie. The story which Nichols and Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing"") have turned into a kind of floating cocktail party at which many of the players are trying as hard to end world communism as they are to get laid is based on ""60 Minutes"" producer George Criles book. The movie hurtles along from one Middle East hot spot to another getting hotter by the moment as Wilson engages Egyptian arms dealers Israeli spies and one particularly effective American belly dancer to build an unlikely alliance of support for the Afghan rebels. Using that war to defeat and demoralize the Soviets Wilson raised the budget for U.S. covert operations in Afghanistan from 5 million at the start of the Soviet occupation to 1 billion a year by the time the Afghans drove the Russians out in 1989. The Berlin Wall fell nine months later. You can draw your own conclusions or let the movie draw them for you. Its not shy about doing that. Along with last years Da Vinci Code"" this is only Hanks second live-action starring role since 2004 and its a welcome return. Though Wilson is more of a scoundrel than hes accustomed to playing Hanks has a convincingly wicked gleam in his eye the whole time. He even shows off his bottom at one point. Hoffman steals every scene hes in partly because the part is written for a big gaudy performance and partly because hes just that good. With one terrific dramatic performance already this fall in ""Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead"" he demonstrates his full range here and in a serio-comic role in ""The Savages"" which opens Christmas Day. All of a sudden Hoffman is having one of the most spectacular years any movie actor ever had.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 20 2007 748 AM Charlie Wilsons War Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts save Afghanistan from the Russkies. By Dana Stevens Tom Hanks Amy Adams and Julia Roberts in Charlie Wilsons War My first reaction to Charlie Wilsons War (Universal) the new Mike Nichols comedy based on a 2003 nonfiction best seller by George Crile and adapted for the screen by Aaron Sorkin was to heave a sigh of relief that it wasnt awful. That may be a low bar to set but Nichols 40-year directorial career has been like the report card of an unstable student who gets either As or Fs. With every movie you hold your breath Is this going to be a note-perfect satire (The Graduate) or a flailing excruciation (The Birdcage)? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. As it turns out the previous Nichols movie this one most resembles is the 1988 romantic comedy Working Girl. Charlie Wilsons War is a funny sprightly tribute to the American can-do spirit with a bleak ending that suggests that our plucky protagonist may have just dug his own (or in this case his countrys) grave. This film does have glaring faults. Its storytelling verges on the slapdash and its vision of politics as a game of personal brinksmanship can ring sentimental and shallow. But like its priapic hero the movie charges forward with a lusty vitality that helps the viewer forgive it a multitude of sins. Advertisement Tom Hanks plays ""Good Time"" Charlie Wilson a go-along-to-get-along Democratic congressman from a rural district in Texas. A hard-drinking womanizer with a sharp eye for foreign affairs Charlie sits on the congressional committee responsible for funding covert military actions abroad. One debauched evening in 1980 soaking in a Vegas hot tub with a gaggle of coke-snorting strippers he watches Dan Rather on TV covering the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Soon after a fervently anti-Communist Houston socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) invites Charlie to a fund-raiser for the cause of the mujahideen. The two skip out of the party for some (off-screen) Texas lovin and by way of pillow talk Joanne convinces Charlie to take a meeting shes arranged with the president of Pakistan Zia ul-Haq (Om Puri). Converted to the freedom fighters cause--or maybe just in love with the idea of bringing down the Red Army on his own--Charlie mobilizes a clandestine campaign to funnel resources and weapons to the Afghan rebels. With one well-placed phone call he manages to double the appropriations budget but even 10 million is a paltry sum when it comes to shooting down Soviet helicopters. Eventually Charlie hooks up with Gust Avrokotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a CIA agent on the verge of being fired for his filthy mouth and foul temper. When Gust and Charlie meet just as a drug scandal is breaking in the congressmans office (a wonderfully staged scene straight from a door-slamming sex farce) the two men realize that theyre brothers under the skin romantic pragmatists who get off on gaming the system for the sheer sport of it. Its getting boring handing out compliments to Hoffman whos given standout performances in three movies since October alone. But he nearly hijacks the movie as the graceless hyperintelligent Gust. Hoffman and Hanks riff off each other with great chemistry and charm--hell Id sell these guys a grenade launcher if I had one. But the same cant be said of Hanks and Roberts. Julia looks sensational--a scene in a bikini will have you disbelieving that she ever gave birth to twins--but theres something synthetic perhaps even a little condescending about her portrait of a sex-loving Commie-hating Southern matriarch. Youre never really convinced that she believes in Jesus or the mujahideen and it doesnt help that her character is by far the most underwritten of the big three. The smaller roles are better and better cast Ned Beatty as a softhearted senator Amy Adams as Charlies Girl Friday and Emily Blunt as the leggy daughter of a favor-seeking constituent. Because of the movies rollicking pace--its barely 97 minutes long--its sometimes hard to distinguish Nichols and Sorkins real politics from the pieties theyre trying to skewer. For the most part they seem to share the main characters conviction that ""killing Russkies"" at least in the context of the Afghan invasion was an unalloyed good. A brief scene in which a piggish Russian pilot is shot down by newly armed Afghan villagers veers close to jingoism. The rare scenes of war on the ground in Afghanistan seem straight from a video game--civilians scattering as we watch them get picked off from a helicopters-eye view. And a triumphant montage in which music from Handels Messiah plays as Soviet copters spin to the ground in flames is surely meant to be ironic--so why does it feel so damn inspiring? Charlie Wilsons War ends on a queasy note as the congressman is celebrated for arming the very country that 20 years later would harbor some of our worst and poorest enemies. A few rushed scenes track Charlies unsuccessful attempts to divert funds for post-Soviet reconstruction in Afghanistan but that story line seems to bore Nichols as much as the talk of rebuilding schools bores congressmen. Final ironies aside the movies freewheeling devil-may-care mood remains a symptom of the extent to which Reagan nostalgia has penetrated even the liberal mainstream. In Sorkin and Nichols fantasy 80s Republicans and Democrats can literally get in bed together for the greater good of the country and covert wars fought by proxy can keep the bad guys out of our back yard at least for a decade or two.

After all Aaron Sorkin who created the TV show wrote the films script. But thats not exactly faint praise. When it was clicking The West Wing was great TV of the walking-and-talking variety. Likewise when Charlie Wilsons War is on target - pretty much every time Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman appear on-screen together - its a really enjoyable movie. Yet Charlie Wilsons War also falls prey to some of the shortcomings of Sorkins series and his work in general. Its slick smooth and easily digestible but the film is too glib at times for its own good fitting a glossy sheen over one of the more bizarre episodes in recent U.S. history. That would be Wilsons work to help fund rebels in Afghanistan in their fight against their Soviet occupiers in the 1980s. How Wilson a congressman from Texas got interested in the war tells you all you need to know about him He noticed one of Dan Rathers 60 Minutes reports while drinking and soaking in a Las Vegas hot tub awash in cocaine and strippers. Wilson says he comes from the one congressional district in the country whose constituents dont want anything from him so he can make whatever allegiances he likes. This has set him up well to raise tons of secret money. But he needs help in other ways. That comes in the form of Gust Avrakotos (Hoffman) surely the most disgruntled agent in the history of the CIA. Nursing the wounds of a career spent on undesirable assignments hes more than happy to offer Wilson the overseas help hell need to broker such a delicate negotiation. Wilson also enjoys the assistance in more ways than one of a true believer beyond-rich Houston socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts). Director Mike Nichols gets great work out of Hanks and especially Hoffman which is no surprise. The back-and-forth banter between two men who play without rules is Sorkin at his best. And both roles are choice particularly that of Wilson; by all accounts the guy was kind of a good-timing kook. Its fun to see Hanks the picture of Hollywood respectability play a boozing lech. But Roberts too is quite good imbuing Herring with as much steely resolve as Wilson or Avrakotos albeit expressed in different ways. Like in The West Wing Sorkins script explains some complicated doings in an entertaining way. But the films not sure where to go once Wilson gets what he wants. Although Wilsons work helped the Afghans fend off the Soviet Union it also helped arm the people who would soon come not just to hate us but to kill us. We see Wilson complaining that we arent helping rebuild the country that we havent figured out an end game a familiar complaint these days; those are about the only clues we get that Wilsons work would come back to haunt us in ironic ways. Its an odd ending a tonal shift that teases the audience with relevance but unlike the films performances never really delivers.

"Charlie Wilsons War | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; charlie-wilson-s-war ) Charlie Wilsons War (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a curious thing. Whenever this much talent is assembled for a motion picture the result inevitably seems to be a letdown. And to say that Charlie Wilsons War is topheavy with talent is to understate the matter. The cast features three Oscar winners and two nominees. The director has been nominated five times and won once. The writer is a multiple Emmy winner. The cinematographer has a couple of Oscar nominations and the composer has six. Almost against the odds however Charlie Wilsons War does not collapse under the weight of expectations. In fact it meets them squarely without flinching. With its rapid pace smart screenplay and top-notch acting this is one of the 2007 Oscar seasons most appealing and compelling adult motion pictures. The screenplay penned by veteran writer Aaron Sorkin is based on George Criles biography of Congressman Charlie Wilson who is credited as being one of the architects of the United States covert war against the USSR in Afghanistan. While the film takes liberties with some of the details the broad strokes are accurate. Its fascinating to look back at the pre-Taliban era and see some of the factors that led to the countrys becoming destabilized. While the Taliban is never mentioned (it did not come into power until some six years after the conclusion of the events in this movie) it casts a long shadow over events that unfold during Charlie Wilsons War. It is impossible to watch this movie without considering the natural progression of events after the Soviet retreat. When the film begins Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is the Democratic Congressman from Texas second district. Known more for his love of parties and beautiful women Good Time Charlie becomes aware of the situation in Afghanistan shortly after being named to the Defense Appropriations subcommittee in 1980. The budget for covertly opposing the USSR in Afghanistan at the time is 5 million. Charlie places a phone call and orders it doubled. But as he learns from his friend socialite and right wing mover-and-shaker Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) thats not going to be enough. Charlie ends up on a whirlwind tour of Pakistan where he meets the President (Om Puri) and walks through the refugee camps. He returns to Washington with renewed determination to open up the coffers and get the ""freedom fighters"" (Afghan Mujahideen) weapons that will enable them to bring down Soviet helicopters. With the aid of CIA operative Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) Charlie begins a campaign that eventually leads to the U.S. diverting more than 500 million of aid to Afghanistan. Politically based stories of this sort run the risk of coming across as dry; thats not the case here. Director Mike Nichols keeps this fast-paced film moving and Sorkin peppers the screenplay with one-liners that vary from amusing to laugh-aloud funny. Charlie Wilsons War is justly classified as a drama but someone could be excused for thinking its a comedy. The film is more insightful incisive and intelligent than any of the many other current Middle East-themed motion pictures. Equally as important it doesnt play politics with a loaded deck. This is not a repudiation of the totality of Americas Afghanistan policy although it makes it plain where the biggest error lay. Ironically one could argue that the films point validates aspects of the current Iraq strategy. As the acting foundation of Charlie Wilsons War Tom Hanks gives another fine performance although its not the kind of meaty role one normally associates with nominations. He shows fundamental changes to Charlies nature as the man changes from a good ole boy (reminiscent of J.R. Ewing) to someone with a conscience. Hanks is perfect for the role. No mater how questionable a characters ethics we always want to side with him if hes played by Hanks. Thats currency in the emotional bank and it works perfectly with Charlie a disreputable individual who develops into something more. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the standout shamelessly pilfering nearly every scene hes in whether hes breaking glass shouting at the top of his lungs or uttering heartfelt profanities. If Hoffman only gets nominated for one of his trio of amazing 2007 performances (the other two being The Savages and Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead) its going to be difficult picking for which he is the most deserving. Amy Adams delightful as always is Charlies ever-faithful assistant. Ned Beatty plays Doc Long the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee. Emily Blunt shows up briefly (and memorably). If theres a negative its Julia Roberts. Either shes miscast or her heart isnt into acting but this is an example of plastic and ineffective acting. Theres little here of the fire and passion that earned the actress a statuette for Erin Brockovich. Its a shame but it doesnt hurt the movie too much - Roberts is only in a handful of scenes. Theres some interesting musical stuff going on as well. Composer James Newton-Howard has borrowed the ""He Shall Purify"" chorus from Handels Messiah and put it to good use. This is perhaps the first time any song from the oratorio has been used as a battle anthem. One could argue that it simply fits the mood but considering the words (""He shall purify the sons of Levi that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness"") and the context in which the song is employed there is a strong element of irony here. Its a pretty subtle thing so many viewers wont get it. With so many movies working on auto-pilot its easy to forget the pleasure of a well-written screenplay and even easier to forget how good things can be when a director of Mike Nichols pedigree brings the script to life. The film has it all suspense drama and humor. Theres a brilliant scene in which Charlie is conferring with Gust and his aides keep interrupting with news about his involvement in a cocaine scandal. The deftness of timing necessary in this scene is the kind of thing that would have Charlie Chaplin smiling (as is the ""punch line"" which involves a bottle of whiskey). Sorkins screenplay is clean and crisp and not muddled by an overt political agenda (surprising since Sorkin is openly political). From start to finish Charlie Wilsons War is an unrelieved delight and it works even better for those who understand the bridges that took us from the withdrawal of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan to 9/11 and beyond.

The films underlying twist though is tartly ironic. Even as were cheering on Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) a back-scratching log-rolling good-ol-boy Texas congressman of the 1980s who stumbles onto the cause of his career when he decides to covertly fund Afghanistans mujahideen rebels against the Soviet Union its never clear if Wilsons ""commitment"" is anything but a more elevated and naive form of hubris. When we first meet Charlie hes sitting in a Las Vegas hot tub surrounded by drugs and Playboy bimbos. Middle-aged and single a happy alcoholic who can make a Scotch in the morning look like the height of civility Charlie adores the perks of power and knows how to hold on to them. Hanks who has been repressing the sleaze he showed in early roles for too long bites into Charlies buttery corruption and Nichols and Sorkin turn the wonkish jargon of politics into light comedy by staying absolutely true to it. Theres so much lying going on that each time someone actually comes out with something he believes its like the jabbiest of punchlines. Charlies awakening is spurred by his alliance with Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts game if a bit waxy) a wealthy born-again right-wing Houston socialite he occasionally sleeps with. Joanne more clued in to world affairs than Charlie wants the U.S. to provide heavy-duty weaponry for the Afghanistan war which is already turning into the Soviets Vietnam. Charlie is a Southern Cold War hawk himself (he sits on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee) and once he visits an Afghan refugee camp and meets children with their limbs blown off he has all the motivation he needs. But any overt involvement would play into Soviet propaganda. To facilitate his covert arms plan Wilson teams up with a slovenly CIA bureaucrat Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) whose desire to spur U.S. action is comically inseparable from the resentment he feels at a life of third-rate espionage gigs. (No one does petty cubicle rage like Hoffman.) The two forge a passel of strange bedfellows uniting an Israeli arms dealer with the leader of Pakistan. Charlie Wilsons War is a journalistic satire of realpolitik in which our jerry-rigged alliances which looked strategic at the time end up biting the U.S. in unforeseen ways. Hovering over the film is the audiences realization that the Afghan war while it hastened the downfall of the Soviet Union created the breeding ground for an arguably more toxic threat the jihad radicals who had nothing but hatred for the West (even as they were only too happy to use its rocket launchers). Instead of running with that irony though the movie grows pious about it. The unconvincingly abrupt finale snuffs ambiguity. It says Charlie was right to fight his war -- if only Congress had had the will to support his reconstruction dream All of which sounds a little too close to recently made rationalizations for a certain other war.

Or maybe Mikhail Gorbachev? ""Charlie Wilsons War"" tells another wilder considerably more amusing inside story. In this version of history based on George Criles nonfiction best seller the credit for the routing of the Soviet Army by the mujahedin rebels in Afghanistan belongs to a little-known congressman named Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) a womanizing scandal-plagued hard-drinking liberal pol from Texas. And he has two unlikely partners his occasional lover Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) a born-again right-wing millionaire socialite and Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a tough uncouth working-class Greek-American CIA officer who likes nothing better than killing Russians.In director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Aaron Sorkins rapid-fire account we see how these three well-connected allies inspired by anti-communist fever and humanitarian outrage over the plight of the besieged Afghans secretly funded the covert war. They supplied the rebels with weapons that could never be traced back to the United States while arm-twisting Pakistan Egypt and Israel into working together to help bring about the Soviet defeat. Wilson a good ole boy of enormous personal charm was strategically situated on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee where he managed to raise the funding for these covert ops from a measly 5 million to 1 billion--without informing Congress or the public about what he was up to. ""Charlie Wilsons War"" gives us a somewhat alarming snapshot of how things get done in Washington. You may not be sure whether youre meant to cheer or wince.This may sound wonkish but its played with the rat-a-tat rhythms of a screwball comedy. Nichols aims both high and low careering from satire to sentiment sex comedy to hagiography sitcom to situation paper not always coherently. At times youre not sure how the filmmakers feel about the storys glaring paradoxes. Sorkins witty screenplay--more in the mode of Paddy Chayefskys ""Network"" than his own ""West Wing""--crams an amazing amount of information into its brisk 94 minutes but it may be too short. We want to know a lot more about Robertss big-haired power-brokering dynamo (how does she wield such influence?) and its hard to buy Charlies supposed deep feelings for Joanne when he tears up after hearing shes remarried it comes out of nowhere. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Hanks is winning--his Charlie is a courtly and whip-smart reprobate--but its a stretch for this quintessentially life-size star to be cast as a force of nature. Nor is there an ounce of sexual chemistry between him and Roberts. The movie catches fire however when Hoffmans rude pugnacious Gust shows up a tornado of hilarious rough weather. The bluebloods who run the CIA hate Gusts street style and he hates their timid bureaucratic souls. Hoffman brings out the best in Hanks too--they riff off each other with delicious comic teamwork.Of course hanging over this ironic tale is the deeper historical irony--that many of the ""good guy"" rebels Charlie is funding (and were cheering) will become our mortal enemies. At the end of this story any informed viewer knows lies big-time blowback. Surprisingly Nichols and Sorkin play this trump card timidly. Is this admirable restraint or cold feet? Are they afraid of spoiling the feel-good uplift of Charlies victory with the harsh downdraft of history? Its as if ""Titanic"" ended with a celebratory shipboard banquet followed by a postscript by the way it sank.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

""Charlie Wilsons War"" is that rare Hollywood commodity these days a smart sophisticated entertainment for grownups. Based on the late George Criles sensational bestseller about how an unlikely trio of influential and colorful characters conspired to generate covert financial and weapons support for the Afghan Mujahideen to defeat the Russians in the 1980s -- and armed Americas future enemies in the process -- Mike Nichols film is snappy amusing and ruefully ironic. But not even the stellar talent on both sides of the camera may be enough to make these qualities alluring to general audiences or those much under 40 making B.O. prospects a mid-range thing. Criles 2003 book unfolded the full story of exploits little noticed when they happened a story that once more proves truth can be stranger than fiction and in this case far more outrageous. Charlie Wilson was a liberal Democratic congressman from East Texas known as ""Good Time Charlie"" for his swinging-bachelor lifestyle. He had women everywhere (including as the book points out the present directors current wife Diane Sawyer) and was a big-time boozer but also possessed a strong knowledge of history and a keen interest in foreign affairs. Although the narrative begins with Charlie (Tom Hanks) in a Las Vegas hot tub with three naked ladies and another guy -- and soon has them all doing coke in a limo -- Nichols and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin who knows a thing or three about Washington D.C. generally play down Charlies more licentious and easily caricatured aspects in favor of his bright inquisitive and resourceful traits. Charlie is the first to admit his faults but his most salient talent is as a master operator who can talk to and get along with anyone. Hanks who in certain ways does not ideally match up with Charlies cocky personality and looks persuasively puts across the crucial smoothness and charm. Igniting Charlies passion for helping the Afghans in the wake of the Soviet Unions 1979 invasion is Houston socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) a beauteous and connected power broker who uses her intimacy with Charlie to convince him to do what Congress is unwilling to do End the Cold War by helping the ragtag Afghan holdouts defeat the Russkies. Joanne arranges for Charlie to meet Pakistans President Zia (a sternly wry Om Puri) in Islamabad where despite his faux pas of asking for booze during his audience with a fundamentalist Muslim leader the ball starts rolling and the suffering Charlie witnesses during a visit to an Afghan refugee camp turns the fire in his belly to full flame. There are many stages leading to the point where this good old boy is able to up his governments unpublicized funding of the anti-Soviet jihad from 5 million to 1 billion per year. But the main objective is getting the Mujahideen weapons to shoot down fearsome Russian helicopter gunships and in this endeavor Charlie receives critical help from maverick CIA op Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman). If the movie just glides along amusingly at first while dispensing obligatory exposition it starts firing on all cylinders once Hoffman shows up. Decked out with a pouffy 80s hairdo moustache protruding gut and ever-present smokes Hoffmans Gust moves into a room plants himself there like an unmovable oak and lets loose with a barrage of delicious verbiage that is equal parts exceptional expertise and withering invective. This reps yet another indelible performance from the amazing Hoffman; whenever hes on the picture vibrates with conspiratorial electricity. Knowing Israel has a limitless stash of Soviet-made weapons (and the CIA may not supply U.S.-made weapons to the Afghans) Gust arranges an unthinkable deal between the Jewish state and Islamic Pakistan a deal furthered when Charlie brings his own Texas belly dancer to perform for officials in Cairo. While battling drug charges at home that threaten to send him to prison (a federal case pointedly led by one Rudolph Giuliani) Charlie uses his position on the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee to maneuver cash and kindle support for his cause. When Stinger missiles finally find their way to the Afghan rebels the tide turns leading to the Soviet retreat in 1989. Given the density of the story the hefty number of characters and the governmental arcania involved -- Crile took well over 500 pages to lay it all out -- its impressive how Nichols and Sorkin have compressed the essentials down to a trim 94 minutes (sans final credits scroll). This is the kind of big Hollywood movie on a big subject with big stars that one would expect to clock in at two hours and 20 minutes. That happens to be what Nichols previous political comedy ""Primary Colors"" ran so its possible he learned from that outing which would likely have benefited from similar brevity. The pacing of ""Charlies Wilsons War"" is exceptional. The material provides much to think about and discuss afterward but Nichols doesnt pause for reflection while its all unfolding onscreen. The tempo and balancing act achieved by the director and editors John Bloom and Antonia Van Drimmelen are virtual perfection. Some 37 years later there are interesting echoes here from Nichols film version of ""Catch-22"" relating to illicit activity by those in government service absurd juxtapositions unimaginable eventualities and unofficial history. At the same time given Nichols roots in comic theater its no surprise that the funniest scene in the film is straight out of French (or Broadway) farce as Gust is repeatedly asked to absent himself from Charlies office as the congressman deals with other crises. While one could have expected most filmmakers even these to hammer home the storys dark contemporary irony its handled lightly with a beautiful line of dialogue about how the ball youve set in motion can keep bouncing even after youve lost interest in it. Theres no epilogue only a framing device that seems to sincerely honor Charlies efforts to a surprising degree. But its a film that adores character something everyone here has in spades in one way or another. The books Joanne Herring comes off as hugely charming and sexually manipulative whereas Roberts effectively plays her as almost single-mindedly cunning and Machiavellian. Amy Adams a star since last weekend in the wake of ""Enchanted"" is perkily energetic as Charlies adoring assistant; Ned Beatty has the old pro politician act down pat as a key recruit to Charlies cause; and Ken Stott gets off some wonderful lines and reactions as a crucial Israeli arms connection. Craft contributions notably Stephen Goldblatts lustrous lensing Victor Kempsters versatile production design and Albert Wolskys evocative period costuming are first-rate.
