Though the 4 1/2-hour running time places it beyond the pale for anything but ultra-specialized theatrical distribution this strikingly realized work is a natural for festivals and specialized TV sales outside the U.S. Danish helmer Lars von Triers first film since ""Zentropa"" (1990) is a lunatic ""Twin Peaks""-like meld of black-comedy soap and Z-grade horror flick that looks like an instant cult item among auds willing to go the stretch. Though the 4 1/2-hour running time places it beyond the pale for anything but ultra-specialized theatrical distribution this strikingly realized work is a natural for festivals and specialized TV sales outside the U.S. Shot on video for Danish TV pic unspooled at Venice in a 35mm transfer divided into two parts each containing two episodes. Though pics vid origins remain obvious the quirky nature of the material (mostly printed in orange-sepia tones recalling von Triers first feature ""The Element of Crime"") lends itself to such a look and von Triers impressive use of Dolby translates into a thoroughly theatrical experience. Tone is set from the very beginning with a mock-lugubrious voiceover detailing the history of a giant Copenhagen hospital known as the Kingdom built on ancient marshland once used as bleaching ponds. Over murky shots of chlorine vapors and a hand groping upward audience is told that ""cracks are starting to appear in the edifice"" with the broader message that the spirit world is ready to do battle with the arrogance of 20th-century science. Blood bursting through a wall followed by rock n roll-backed main titles kicks the yarn off in punchy style. Episode one (""The Unheavenly Host"" 66 minutes) starts slowly with intimations that the labyrinthine building is haunted by a dead child as the large cast is introd in mock-soap style. Characters include an arrogant Swedish neurosurgeon Helmer who loathes Danes and has turned a young girl Mona into a vegetable through a bungled brain operation; his lover anesthetist Rigmor whos into Haitian voodooism; Mrs. Drusse an old spiritualist who fakes illnesses to stay in the hospital and solve the haunting; a doctor Hook who runs a black market in medical supplies from the basement; Bondo an obsessed head of pathology; Moesgaard hopeless head of the whole place; and Mogge jilted in his love for a sexy doctor. Two retarded dishwashers in the kitchen function as a kind of Greek chorus. With an eye on the pics epic length von Trier lets the black comedy seep out slowly but some 30 minutes in its clear something is rotten in the Kingdom of Denmark. Despite its high-tech facade the hospital is peopled by obsessives Mogge saws a head off a corpse and presents it to his inamorata senior staff are bound together by some kind of obscure Masonic brotherhood Helmer is covering his tracks over the mismanaged op and the sidewalk is cracking as the spirit world forces its way up. By episode two (""Thy Kingdom Come"" 67 minutes) Monas alter ego is haunting the building in a major way the severed head has gone AWOL and the Masonic group is planning an illegal organ transplant from a dying patient. Most of episode three (""A Foreign Body"" 70 minutes) revolves round various parties secretly raiding the hospital archives for incriminating documents. Meanwhile a doctor Judith is suddenly heavily pregnant with a strange fetus and old Mrs. Drusse has made contact with the ghost a young girl murdered in 1919 by her father (Udo Kier) one of the original buildings founders. Pics grand finale (""The Living Dead"" 76 minutes) has Helmer jetting off to Haiti to practice voodoo on his enemy Moesgaard; Mrs. Drusse exorcising the dead girls spirit in the basement; and Judith giving birth to a huge alien form while a group of politicians tour the building. Shooting in a semi-docu hand-held style with antsy cutting von Trier lets the lunacy slowly grow out of the complex web of escalating events all played in straight-faced manner by the excellent cast. As the corrupt overweening Swede Ernst Hugo Jaregard carries the pic in grand style; veteran actress Ghita Norby hits just the right note as his quietly loony lover; and as Mrs. Drusse Kirsten Rolffes trots steadily through the pic like some spiritualist Miss Marple. All other players are on the button. Most of the filming took place in the actual hospital of the title.

By David Denby Harrison Ford in the fourth movie of the series.   Credit THOMAS FUCHS In 1989 when Sean Connery showed up in the third Indiana Jones movie as Indianas father Henry Jones he was no longer a young man. But Connery then fifty-nine had relaxed beautifully into middle age. Playing alongside Harrison Fords Indy he was crotchety yet formidable. The father was a medievalist the son an archeologist and both were obsessed with lost treasures of unimaginable worth and extraordinary powers and Connery turned a rivalry with the younger actor into high-style mischief. Nineteen years later in the fourth movie in the series ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" Ford now sixty-five is still playing Indy but he cant be described as a man relaxing into middle age. Hes in great shape physically but he doesnt seem happy. Hes tense and glaring and he speaks his lines with more emphasis than is necessary like a drunk who wants to appear sober. In the earlier movies Indy was often surly but his scowl turned into a rakish smile--he dared you to think he was afraid to do something and then before you had quite registered the dare he raced away and did it. Ford combined swagger with charm and he was quick; he moved as if he had steel springs in his legs. He rolls and jumps well enough in ""Crystal Skull"" but his hostile unease in some of the dialogue passages is a real killjoy. And it doesnt help that the screenwriter David Koepp who also worked with Steven Spielberg--the director of all the Indiana Jones movies--on the ""Jurassic Park"" series and ""War of the Worlds"" isnt good at the kind of arrogant banter that was so large a part of the earlier films. In ""Crystal Skull"" Indy keeps his whip mostly furled and his words dont snap either. On balance it was a mistake for Spielberg and George Lucas (who dreamed up the characters co-wrote the stories and produced the series) to revive ""Indiana Jones"" after so many years. ""Crystal Skull"" isnt bad--there are a few dazzling sequences and a couple of good performances--but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone. Stretches of this picture are flat fussy and dull. Trying to regain the old rapture you have to grasp at the few scenes that work--most of them at the beginning. The first three films were set in the nineteen-thirties and drew on Art Deco styling in clothes cars and aircraft. Spielberg has a taste for sleek modernism enhanced by a boys-illustrated-book notion of cool--everything was a little more streamlined and snazzy than life. ""Crystal Skull"" is set in the nineteen-fifties and it begins in Nevada with the same quintessence of period style. As kids hot-rod across military sites with Elvis on the radio Spielberg catches the eras uneasy mixture of blandness latent revolt and apocalypse the jukebox-and-pompadour youth culture side by side with nuclear fears. There is a brilliant unnervingly funny sequence in which Indy after escaping some K.G.B. agents (they were trying to steal some of his earlier finds hoping to use their powers to control America) wanders into a small town with neat wooden houses and square close-cropped lawns adorned with smiling mannequins of typical American families. Indy enters a house where ""The Howdy Doody Show"" blares from a TV. Suddenly he hears a loudspeaker announce a countdown and realizes that hes about to be nuked in a test blast. In a later sequence young Shia LaBeouf makes his entrance wearing a black leather jacket and riding a motorcycle--like Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One."" Hes a snarling kid named Mutt with a thick frequently combed wave of hair; he calls Indy ""Teach"" and he needs a father--like James Dean in ""Rebel Without a Cause."" The K.G.B. agent Irina Spalko played by Cate Blanchett takes off from Lotte Lenyas slit-eyed Commie menace in ""From Russia with Love."" Blanchett wears a full-body flight suit in Soviet gray--drabness turned into fashion by her trim figure--and a rapier hangs from her waist. She enunciates like crazy in Russian-accented English and tilts her cheekbones toward the camera. As is often the case with this actress shes the best thing in the picture. One tries hard not to be distracted from any available pleasure by the plot--thickly woven gibberish about the lost Amazonian city of Akator (formerly known as El Dorado) a crystal skull that has been taken from a temple and a brain-fried archeologist nicknamed Ox (a quavering John Hurt who is no ox). Sure enough after a while the movie settles happily into one of those long chases which Spielberg does better than anyone else. The good guys hurtle down a jungle road in an open truck while Blanchett and her henchmen follow in another truck on a parallel road. The two sides shoot at each other various people jump or are flung back and forth like volleyballs between the vehicles and LaBeouf after a sword fight and a karate match with Blanchett winds up straddling the trucks and receiving many blows to the crotch from passing branches before grabbing onto a vine and swinging his way through the jungle. The sequence ends with Indy and friends going over a cliff in their truck. As they fall they hit a tree sticking out from the cliff wall which bends slowly downward like a giant sapling and deposits them gently in a river below where the truck turns into a pontoon boat. In a sequence like that with wild improbabilities linked by speed and rhythm Spielberg re-creates the spirit of Buster Keatons most elaborately synchronized gags but on a much grander scale. (The Spielberg chase has been the subject of an hommage on TVs ""Family Guy"" in which Peter Griffin fights a giant chicken on many moving vehicles.) The first Indiana Jones movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) had a romping confidence that was electrifying. It was not just an action-adventure movie; it was a spoof of an action-adventure movie an exuberant parody of the kind of schlock shown at weekend matinees in the fifties--movies about cursed tombs and strange rites and ""natives"" chanting mumbo-jumbo in studio jungles or waving swords amid the bazaars of some back-lot Middle East. The stolid hero would gently approach the ""love interest"" a scientists daughter. In ""Raiders"" Karen Allen was the love interest and flirting and scrapping with Ford she had a huge smile and a directly sexual way about her that smashed old cautions. The pattern was set with that film and it varied little in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984) and ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" (1989). At the center of the movies was a search for a buried sacred object (an ark a stone a grail) from the ancient world. To prevent the villains from getting hold of it (Nazis in crisp uniforms appeared in two of the pictures; a wild-eyed blood-sacrificial Thuggee cult in the third) Indy set off from his quiet classroom for some exotic sun-drenched place where he would rout thirty excitable men in turbans by using just his fists a whip and a revolver. A hard-fighting woman joined his quest only to prove more difficult to handle than the bad guys. To reach the tomb of the sanctified object he entered filthy pits and mucky tunnels lined with snakes tarantulas scorpions and rats. He had to be spiritually pure as well as physically adroit to get past the swords spikes and moving walls that booby-trapped the entrance to the inner chamber. Yet Indy never wanted the sacred object for himself (the relics the K.G.B. were after had been laid away in a warehouse); he usually returned it to its rightful owner or just left it in place. The search was everything; renunciation of the spoils was his purity. As he left the chamber it collapsed around him but he escaped. The movies managed to create a formula and add new surprises at the same time. Working before digital technology eliminated gravity Spielberg kept his characters on the ground where he was forced to be inventive. In ""Raiders"" there was an eccentrically staged infinitely dangerous fight between Indy and a bare-chested bruiser. As the wings and moving propellers of a partly unmoored Nazi warplane passed in a circle over their heads the two men swung and ducked in alternating rhythm. Theres nothing that wonderful in ""Crystal Skull""--fistfights with the K.G.B. henchmen go on forever blow after blow. And despite the greater flexibility of digital Spielberg isnt able to create the awed anticipation and tensions of the earlier films the entrance-to-the-tomb scenes are pedestrian and unscary. Karen Allen turns up again but her reunion with Ford is a sexless dud--a disappointment for older fans and probably a puzzler for people who have never seen the earlier movies. Blanchett should be the sexual aggressor here. You expect her to make a pass at LaBeouf (a trial that would test any young man) but it never happens. Reckless daring is whats missing from ""Crystal Skull."" The movie leaves a faint aura of depression because you dont want to think of daring as the exclusive property of youth. There must be a way for middle-aged men to take chances and leap over chasms but repeating themselves with less conviction isnt it.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 24 2008 Save for later Saved Its been 19 years since the last Indiana Jones movie which helps explain the hysteria leading up to the release this week of Steven Spielbergs ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" For the past month you couldnt open up a paper surf the Internet or turn on the TV without hearing about this film - this event.For those of us who do not regard the series as the pinnacle of Hollywood action-adventure escapism all this hoo-ha may seem like a bit much. But then again the three previous installments - ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" - made 1.2 billion worldwide. The ka-ching factor is so high that its no wonder pulses are racing.The Indiana Jones movies began as salutes to the cheapo Saturday-afternoon serials that Spielberg and series producer George Lucas devoured as kids. But theres nothing cutrate about the budgets for these escapades. ""Crystal Skull"" weighs in at 185 million. I usually make it a point to review a movie not its cost. But thats a lot of wampum for what is essentially - well a Saturday-afternoon serial. These Indy films are not indie films. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Harrison Ford complete with fedora and rucksack is back as Indiana. Did you ever doubt it? He may be 65 but he does a manly job of holding down the part. In fact nothing much has changed with Indy - hes still surly and afraid of snakes. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull But a couple of key changes have occurred around him. For one thing the time frame has now moved up to 1957. Make way for the cold war and the Red scare. Early on Indy runs up against Col. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) a Stalin fave and three-time winner of the Order of Lenin who with Indy held at gunpoint engineers a raid on a top-secret US Army warehouse in Nevada containing mummified remains of ... well lets just say the box is marked ""Roswell.""From this it is but a short leap - and there are many leaps in this film short and long - to the discovery deep in the Peruvian jungles of the Crystal Skull of Akator (dont ask). Colonel Spalko wants to track down the origin of the skull which she believes will grant her eternal knowledge - i.e. power.At least Spielberg and Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp havent brought back the Nazis for a third tour of duty. Not that Russkies are much of an improvement. Neither is it such a great improvement to saddle Indy with an equally surly young sidekick Mutt Williams played by Shia LaBeouf whos a dead ringer for Marlon Brando in ""The Wild One."" The pairing is all too obviously a ploy to attract a younger demographic but I dont think the series needs this sop. The previous installments have been hugely successful with kids who only know these movies on DVD. Much more welcome is the return of Karen Allen as Indys old flame Marion Ravenwood even though they spend most of their screen time together bickering. Allen still has the most captivating smile in the business and she knows how to be spunky without being cloying (not as easy as it sounds).How does the new Indiana Jones movie stack up with the other ones? Id place it somewhere in the middle but since as I say Im not a die-hard enthusiast thats faint praise. All of the films seem too overly engineered too by-the-numbers too pushily ""iconic."" Spielberg is such a fantastically adept filmmaker that even when hes working at half speed he can work up a pretty good action sequence. But even the best set pieces in ""Crystal Skull"" like the pursuit of Indy through the Amazonian jungle by the KGB or a dive over a triple-decker waterfall have a deja vu quality.""Crystal Skull"" is a fun ride but if we have to wait 19 years for the next one thats OK by me.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 22 2008 558 PM Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull What would a 32nd-century scholar make of Harrison Ford? By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull If some 32nd-century archeologist were to unearth a DVD copy of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Paramount) her first task--after converting the barbaric early digital technology to a more current brain-wave-based viewing system--would be to understand what this object meant to the culture that created it. What combination of nostalgia repetition compulsion and love of big dumb spectacle would have sent these benighted tribesmen back to the Indiana Jones myth 27 years after its creation and 19 years since Indiana last rode into the sunset? Why did the people of the early 21st century still need Indiana Jones? As our future archeologist might point out to her students theres no disputing the sheer workmanship of the artifact. Though none of the sequels yet unearthed can quite match the original for fineness of detail this ""Spielberg""--did the name designate just one man or was it a group attribution for a guild of anonymous craftsmen?--was unquestionably a master artisan of the still-primitive film form. The mark of the Spielberg school is particularly evident in The Crystal Skullscar-chase sequences. One spectacular chase through the Amazon forest a wildly imaginative deployment of every possible combination of vehicle weapon obstacle and flying human body almost recalls the stunts of Buster Keaton (to invoke one of this long-dead civilizations lost cinematic saints). And Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) himself the archetypal whip-cracking archeology professor is more miraculously preserved than the Roswell space aliens and mummified conquistadors he digs up over the course of the movie. Its as if after decades of exile in mediocre films now lost to the sands of time the craggy 65-year-old (who incredibly still does most of his own stunts) has returned to the role he was always meant to play. Advertisement Surviving accounts suggest that some ancient scribes rose up against Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull calling it ""sticky kids stuff"" or ""cynical clinical gibberish."" Though its a scholars job to shed her 32nd-century prejudices and understand the belief systems of those long dead our archeologist will have to ask herself What were these scribes thinking? Were they expecting something more fun than Cate Blanchett as a pitiless Ukrainian KGB agent driven by a Faustian lust for knowledge or John Hurt as a scholar driven mad after staring into the eye sockets of a glass cranium from outer space? Were they disappointed with the return of the buoyant Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood Indys tomboyish lost love? Were they too jaded to enjoy the fantasy of driving a jeep down three consecutive waterfalls or descending the ingeniously constructed retracting staircase inside a Peruvian obelisk to reach the portal to another dimension? Did they get to wake up every day and see a wittily choreographed motorcycle chase through the quads of Yale (called Marshall University in the film)? Even the most enthusiastic future Indy scholar would have to concede that the movies habit of quoting from venerable Hollywood antiquities sometimes has the unfortunate effect of reminding the viewer that those movies were better. No amount of ducktail-combing or Harley-revving is going to make the doe-eyed Shia LaBeouf into Marlon Brando in The Wild One and the close encounter that Indy and Co. experience when they finally reach that interdimensional portal is nowhere near as thrilling as Richard Dreyfuss apotheosis in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. But expecting Brando-esque menace or Dreyfus-ian uplift from the Indiana Jones tetralogy is like going to the candy counter at the mall multiplex and asking for some goat cheese and a nice cabernet instead of malted milk balls and a Coke. Spielbergs movies are crude but efficient systems for the delivery of pleasure--this is both the gift and the curse of the man who invented the summer blockbuster. Early in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade the third installment in the series Indy seeking to recover a priceless antique from a brigand brandishes the artifact and scolds ""This belongs in a museum."" ""You belong in a museum"" the villain replies. Its not meant as a compliment--immediately afterward the guy throws Indy off the side of a ship--but I think history will prove the bad guy right. Indiana Jones--both the swashbuckling archeologist and the joyfully hokey brazenly sentimental obscenely successful franchise he sired--is a part of our cultures Hollywood patrimony. When that Virgin Megastore gets excavated in 3112 A.D. I hope Indiana Jones ends up where it belongs. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is OK. Just OK. Eh meh feh all those underwhelmed monosyllables - any one of them will do. The great Steven Spielberg and the great George Lucas reteaming with the great Harrison Ford and the great John Williams (cue triumphal brass) have revived one of the great adventure series in cinematic history with a film of great blandness and mediocrity. Its not bad exactly. Its not a desecration of the franchise. Its just . . . tired. I would say ``old but that might suggest an ageist criticism of the now-65-year-old Ford. Indy has the same gift for rip-snorting swashbucklery he always had - same bullwhip same drooping brown fedora same way with his fists - and Ford doles it all out with that same sardonic manliness. Believe me his AARP qualifications are not an issue. But theres something pro forma about much of the film as though director Spielberg executive producer Lucas and screenwriter David Koepp took that 19-year-old box of Indiana Jones biscuit mix off the shelf and dutifully read the directions. Everythings in there the pulpy plot the sepia maps the ridiculous bad guys the cobwebby skeletons and the cataclysmic paranormal whirlwind at the climax. The film gets off to a killer start in the Nevada desert ripping through vigorous fight scenes and sassy one-liners with that terrific Jonesy aplomb. Cate Blanchett sporting a flapper pageboy and an evil Ukrainian accent plays a spooky Soviet overlord on the hunt for supernatural artifacts. Its 1957 its the Cold War and she vants to read our minds. But first she vants the contents of a crate in Area 51 and for that she needs the illustrious Professor Jones. He enters in the trunk of a car exits on a rocket engine and closes out the movies wildly entertaining introduction silhouetted against a mushroom cloud. Yet the title of this film is not Indiana Jones and the Case of the Radiation Poisoning. It is Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull which implies a trip to an ancient civilization and a certain translucid brain case - or as it turns out a flimsy-looking hunk of molded plastic. (Ive stepped on Lego pieces more substantial.) But it serves as an excuse to introduce young greaser Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) and old colleague Ox (John Hurt). The latter disappears on a quest for the skull and reappears in a poncho speaking Mayan. There are chase scenes. There are sword fights. There are ants. Indys old flame Marion (Karen Allen) shows up. So does one of Fords lines from Star Wars (``Ive got a bad feeling about this). Indy movies have always looted the classics. I remember sitting in the theater in 1984 slack-jawed at Indiana Jones and the Temple of Dooms plunderous homage to Gunga Din. With Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Spielberg takes this spirit of thievery one step further stuffing the plot with pilfered bits of old Spielberg movies. Ill leave it to you to identify them; I dont want to give too much away. But if Indiana Jones looks tired in the stretch its exhaustion stems in part from two forces outside Spielbergs control. The first is almost 20 years worth of rip-offs The Mummy did Indy no favors. And whose fault is it Spielbergs or Jon Turteltaubs that Crystal Skull reminded me of National Treasure Book of Secrets? Second These same two decades brought huge advances in computerized visual effects many of them trailblazed by Lucas and Spielberg themselves. Its natural they would use them on Indy. But there are points in the film where the effects look so airless and digitized - so fake - that they ruin the illusion of down-to-earth jaw-cracking swagger that made Indiana Jones such darn fun. He always seemed like an average guy. But the movie just seems average. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off Sony Heavy Duty Zinc AA Battery 120-Pack for 25 + free shipping American Eagle Mens Leather Flip Flops for 12 + 7 samp;h Unisex Cushioned Arch Supports for 1 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Its 1957. Rock music blares. Clean-cut kids whoop and holler and race an army convoy in the Nevada desert. Prairie dogs observe the action. The convoy veers into a restricted compound. A brown fedora lands on the dusty ground. Soon the man whose head it so famously belongs to is pulled from a car trunk. The Russians arent coming the Russians arent coming. Theyre here. And Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones and a friend (Ray Winstone) are in a jam.  RATING | Adventure Cate Blanchett plays Soviet Irina Spalko (""Stalins favorite""). The occult-leaning villain is trying to locate a crystal skull with immeasurable powers. The opening is vintage Indy courtesy of one of the most heralded reunions in filmdom director Steven Spielberg Indy creator George Lucas (in an executive-producer role) and star Harrison Ford. Karen Allen arrives later to reprise her feisty role as Marion Ravenwood Indys screwball-romantic foil in 1981s ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Almost all of the movies spry moments happen early in this fourth long-awaited installment Fords archaeologist-hero scrambles up a stack of crates in an impressive show of fitness as well as intellectual finesse. Metal objects skitter and float toward a wooden crate that contains a shrouded oddly magnetic body. Theres even an eerie-funny (though uncomfortable for my taste) joke made about A-bombs and nuclear families. There are fistfights and a wild escape. Unfortunately after this rousing salvo ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (written by David Koepp) provides a different metaphor for itself cobwebs. Its not Ford who seems dusty or musty here. Hes in arch form. Its the enterprise. Shia LaBeouf arrives on a motorcycle in Marlon Brando drag straight out of ""The Wild One."" This rebel named Mutt turns out to have a cause. Hes looking to find his surrogate grandfather Professor Oxley (John Hurt) who has disappeared. Indy and Mutt will head to Peru in search of Oxley and the mysterious Crystal Skull of Akator. Youd be right to hope for the chemistry of ""The Last Crusade"" (1989). But back then Sean Connery as Henry Sr. made just the right sort of alpha dog for Ford. LaBeouf is barely a pup. Of course spider webs insects and a horror-flick army of red ants abound. Before there was ""Fear Factor"" there was Indy. And before Nic Cage and company went on the hunt for national treasures there was Indy. For those drawn deepest into the pleasures of Indiana Jones adventures they were joy rides. (Then they became amusement park rides.) But to an appreciator more than a fan they have always provided a witty riff on film and Hollywood itself. Early on Jim Broadbents character arrives outside of Dr. Jones classroom. Only he comes not to bring Jones news of a fresh adventure but to tell him the Marshall College administration doesnt support him in his recent run-in with the FBI. Its a fine nod to the fear and loathing during the House Un-American Activities Committee. But screenwriter Koepp seems to run out of steam and agility. The franchise has often teased the notion Is Indiana a grave robber or a protector of the priceless? Its a question one can pose to many a filmmaker. Are they merely raiders of Hollywoods vaults or keepers of its treasures? The finer moments of the ""Indiana Jones"" series kept the flame going with homages to the vibrancy of Howard Hawks as well as the spirit of the Saturday matinee. Not surprisingly -- and hardly immodestly given Spielbergs and Lucas place in Hollywood history -- ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" has added to its trove of cinematic artifacts the works of its filmmakers ""American Graffiti"" gets a shout-out. The crystal skull suggests a close encounter. (Did someone say Indy phone home?) Ultimately ""The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is instant artifact. Its a vessel with a great deal of pictorial images on its surface. But its contents are long gone. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Comments Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Rated PG-13  124 minutes The unholy mix of George Lucass colonialist nostalgia and Steven Spielbergs fluency with action becomes more self-conscious in this fourth Indiana Jones outing. In 1957 two decades after the events of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade the hero (Harrison Ford) joins forces with his old flame from Raiders of the Lost Ark (Karen Allen) and a young punk (Shia LaBeouf) to combat a commie villain (Cate Blanchett doing a variation on Garbos Ninotchka) in a remote corner of Peru. The character and plot contrivances are dumber than ever but this is basically vaudeville not narrative and the thrills keep coming. (Once Indy has survived a nuclear blast early on going over three waterfalls in a row without wetting his lighter is par for the course.) Spielbergs extravagant action much of it staged on what look like old sets from King Kong includes pointed steals from The Naked Jungle (1954) Land of the Pharaohs (1955) The Ten Commandments (1956) and his own Close Encounters E.T. and A.I.

Starring Harrison Ford Cate Blanchett Shia LaBeouf and Karen Allen. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at SFGate.com/movies.) Nothing about the new ""Indiana Jones"" movie feels creaky. Everything old is rejuvenated including Harrison Ford who looks younger and less cranky than he has in years. The movie moves. It has action sequences that are so enormous that they wont just wow audiences but rock them back in their seats and make them laugh at the audacity of it all. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal"" is probably the worst of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies but its still pretty much a delight from the beginning almost until the end. Almost. Something holds the fourth installment back and thats director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter David Koepps determination to make it an action movie in the modern style. If everything old about ""Indiana Jones"" is new again the one thing new about it is what seems old The filmmakers insistence on making a film in which the action is nonstop in which the viewer and the characters never quite have the chance to breathe. That Spielberg especially should want to try his hand at this is understandable. He is one of the pioneers of the modern action movie and what could be more fun than to demonstrate at an age when he could be resting on his Oscar his Thalberg and his AFI awards that he not only can master some new tricks but can do them better than anybody? And he can. The action in the new ""Indiana Jones"" is more inventive more lovingly detailed and a lot more pleasurable than anything you could hope to see in action movies. But in proving that he can do it Spielberg also shows why it shouldnt be done. He shows why its a dead-end. Even Spielberg reaches a point of diminishing returns in which the movie begins to feel like a video game and the audience longs for - not quiet not peace - but an opportunity to savor the reunions the one between us and the characters and also the one between Ford and Karen Allen his co-star in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the original ""Indiana Jones"" film. This is not to say we dont get little moments in there but considering how much pleasure the audience is willing to take in the characters and not just in their exploits its not quite enough. Yet anyone who sees the movie wont even know what Im talking about until after the first hour. Audiences who have been anticipating ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" should love the first half and skeptics will be persuaded. With a sense of fun that characterizes much of the film Spielberg pulls from the old Hollywood playbook in introducing Ford. We see his hat. We see his silhouette. And then he turns and in a close-up mutters ""Russians"" Thats right Russians. The year is 1957 and the Soviets - particularly a scientist named Irina (Cate Blanchett) - are searching for paranormal artifacts. In particular shes in search of a crystal skull and a lost South American city that she believes will be the key to world domination. She wants the Soviet Union to control everyones mind. Fine. Every movie has to have a plot and thats this ones. From the first scene in which Indiana is kidnapped and brought to a facility in Nevada to help Irina the consummate skill of the filmmakers is unmistakable. Director of photography Janusz Kaminski (""Schindlers List"") composes the characters within the frame like Gregg Toland in an old William Wyler movie with everything crisply outlined in deep focus. Its an homage to the 1940s style that doesnt copy the 40s so much as show how say a Toland might do things were he working today. For a while a long while skill is enough. Theres skill for example in the long chase scene through the jungle in which Indiana and his cohorts have the crystal skull and Irina and the Soviets want it. Screenwriter Koepp comes up with various ways for the characters to end up in each others vehicles. Sometimes one side has the skull sometimes another. There are cliffs to negotiate and when all else fails theres always an attack of giant ants. But skill without inspiration is something you can get from a Vegas act. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is a professional job done by professionals. For better or worse thats all it is. Be content with that or go watch the one with Sean Connery - again. On the plus side small flaws and too much action cant take away from the pleasure of seeing Ford back in this signature role and in his signature hat. Shia LaBeouf his sidekick this time plays well off the ""old man"" (""What are you like 80?""). And its no surprise to anybody when his mother turns out to be Marion (Allen) reunited with Ford after 27 years. Her role as written consists of little but high spirits and high-spirited carping but Allen looks as happy as Marion at being the one Indiana ended up with after all. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is no ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but if you look at the long tired history other sequels made years after the initial magic had faded - ""Rocky Balboa"" ""The Phantom Menace"" ""The Barkleys of Broadway"" - this has to rank among the respectable entries. -- AdvisoryLots of action and scenes of peril.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The fourth Indiana Jones adventure expanding the formerly earthbound series to include space aliens and flying saucers should be titled ""Close Encounters of the Tired Kind."" Harrison Ford Steven Spielberg and George Lucas go through the motions but fail to recapture the magic that made ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" an escapist masterpiece and its two sequels entertaining romps. The new film in theaters today moves the Man in the Hat to 1957 and late middle age. With the Nazis gone Indy now faces down the Red Menace in the field and Cold War blacklisting on his college campus. After being forced to help a squad of Russian soldiers invading a secret base in New Mexico where they steal an extraterrestrial artifact Jones is accused by overzealous FBI agents of aiding the enemy and is fired from the position. He follows the Russians to the wilds of South America where the legendary Crystal Skull holds the key to Soviet mind-reading warfare. (An elongated transparent cranium with purple neon highlights the doohickey resembles a custom phone you might find at Spencers Gifts.) Joining Jones are his juvenile-delinquent sidekick Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) Indianas feisty first love Marion (Karen Allen) his undependable partner Mac (Ray Winstone) and Prof. Oxley (John Hurt) an academic who has gone native and nutty in the jungle. The film isnt a travesty like Lucas ""Star Wars"" prequels but aside from a clever atomic test-site sequence its listless low in energy and poorly paced. Is it the age or the mileage? Maybe its the general wear and tear of overfamiliarity. It doesnt help that ""National Treasure"" ""Sahara"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"" have spawned copycat adventures. The set pieces are so recognizable that they feel like a stroll down memory lane. When our grumpy archaeologist explores a lost temple there seems to be dust on top of dust cobwebs on the cobwebs. As Ford rasps at one point ""Same old same old."" Ford who is now 65 is in stupendous shape -- a shower scene shows how much time he has been spending with his personal trainer -- but he sleepwalks through the part in an uninspired performance. His fights lack the acrobatic snap and tension of earlier brawls. At this stage in his career Dr. Jones isnt an athletic daredevil. Hes spry. David James Associated Press In this image released by Paramount Pictures Harrison Ford and Cate Blanchett left are shown in a scene from the film ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" The action sequences are staged and edited sloppily a far cry from the death-defying stuntman extravaganzas of yore. The chief villain is Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett reveling in the role of a saber-wielding femme fatale). She and her henchmen battle Jones crew in endless repetitive scenes of vehicular combat. Opponents must leap between speeding automobiles a hundred times and the overkill is wearying. Most of the high-tension moments are transparently fake with actors swaying in front of a green screen. When Indy lowered himself between the wheels of a speeding truck in ""Raiders"" you knew you were seeing a risky deed accomplished in reality. Here when cars race along a cliff edge you think ""Nice computer graphics."" The genuinely ooky live snakes rats and insects from the earlier films are replaced with CG ants that simply dont have the same bite. Worse yet the fuzzy-friendly Lucas inserts colonies of icky-cute prairie dogs and tribes of monkeys in an inane passage where Mutt swings on jungle vines Tarzan-style. The film ends on a note that suggests hes being groomed to pick up the bullwhip in future installments of the series. Im not sure Id welcome that; it might be time for Ford to hang up the fedora.

""How much of human life"" he muses ""is waiting."" How true how true. Sitting through Steven Spielbergs slog down memory lane means waiting for surprise waiting for delight waiting for daylight after turgid trudges through Peruvian caves and waiting for an abstract story to coalesce. Most of all it means waiting in vain for the sort of dazzle dash and clarity that made us love the series in the first place. ENLARGE Harrison Ford and Cate Blanchett star in the latest Indiana Jones film. Ray Winstone (back to viewer) is Mac. Lucasfilm Ltd. Its been 27 years since the first installment and 19 years since the last one Harrison Ford still snapping Indys whip at the age of 65 is no longer a whippersnapper. Hes not the problem though. Both the actor and the character draw on deep reservoirs of goodwill. You want them to be wonderful from the moment Indy makes his entrance -- actually hes preceded by a witty shot of his fedora -- and its great to see him looking like a grizzled desert rat with a glowering smirk or moments later a smirky glower. (The film set in the 1950s is distinguished by witty entrances if little else Cate Blanchetts villainous Soviet agent Irina looking like Garbo in ""Ninotchka"" Shia LaBoeufs pompadoured biker Mutt looking like Brando in ""The Wild One."") Its also touching to see Indy coping as well as he does -- very well indeed -- with the knock-down drag-out challenges of being an action hero at an advanced age. No the problem is all around him and its movie fatigue which can be just as damaging as metal fatigue. A couple of early set pieces dispense spasms of excitement at the expense of plausibility -- an atom-bomb test that trivializes the force of nuclear weapons for the sake of lame comedy a chase that skids to an awkward finish in a university library. But then the movie seemingly weary of itself settles into a soporific succession of episodes having to do with a search for the skull of the title plus extrasensory perception extraterrestrials and ever so fleetingly flying saucers. All of it amounts to a been-there-done-that-better recapitulation of Mr. Spielbergs career. See a clip from ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" One unwelcome surprise is the level of craftsmanship -- widely variable cinematography continuity glitches characterizations ranging from perfunctory to nil. (The script was written by David Koepp while the story is credited to George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson.) Another is the level of performances. Ms. Blanchett a movie star of rare intelligence and grace gets to carry a sword read minds fight fights and strike one sultry pose after another but shes only a decorative presence and a charm-free one (though her characters mind eventually catches fire). Its good to see Karen Allen back as Marion Ravenwood the love of Indys earlier life; it would have been better if shed had something livelier to do than drive an amphibious truck on a chase through trackless jungles. Mr. LaBoeuf a manifestly talented young actor isnt funny and theres no sign of him having been helped by his director. Nor is there much excitement between him and Harrison Ford as they play out a relationship thats the movies worst-kept secret. Video clips and the inside track on more summer movies. The least surprising aspect of the lumbering production is its abuse of computer-generated images -- what were generally called special effects until they stopped being special. Even in that department though the banality is striking -- all those clattering digital ants and groaning stones. I was equally struck by the movies disrespect for the physical world. Sure computers can do anything these days but do we want them to? Theres no logic and therefore less drama in Indys escape from a mock town thats about to be atom-bombed or in that amphibious truck finally going over a series of stupendous waterfalls.

Its a line from the poet John Milton but not the line thats cited by a crazy old professor in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. That bit o Milton is about death - ""the palace of eternity.""Nineteen years have passed since the wise-cracking whip-snapping archaeologist adventurer Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones last dashed around the globe - and cashed big bucks at the box office. Indys gait was quicker then his stance straighter and his delivery. . . well his delivery was about the same. Terse cranky unmusical. But the passage of time is definitely a theme in this ballyhooed third sequel to 1981s Steven Spielberg-directed George Lucas-produced Raiders of the Lost Ark. (OK the first follow-up Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was technically a prequel if you want to get picky.) Set in 1957 at a time of Cold War dread (Commies nukes) and starting in the American Southwest - before hopscotching to the Amazon and the jungles of Peru - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull finds Harrison Ford reunited with his fedora and bomber jacket muttering archaeological mumbo jumbo (check out those ""geoglyphs"") as he runs jumps and socks his way through relentless chase sequences in search of um a mystical ancient something-or-other. That would be the Crystal Skull of Akator a storied artifact whose powers in the wrong hands could be awesome. Enter the awesome Cate Blanchett sporting a Louise Brooks wig a jumpsuit from the house of Hammer amp; Sickle and a Russian accent borrowed from Rocky amp; Bullwinkles Natasha Fatale. The Oscar-winning thespian is Irina Spalko a spy with paranormal prowess and Indy susses her nationality in a rare show of wit by noting how she sinks her teeth into her ""wubble-ewes."" By the time the Crystal Skull is over Blanchett has dogged Dr. Jones and company across hemispheres down waterfalls and through armies of carnivorous ants and has engaged in a swordfight with Shia LaBeouf - the two whacking each other from the flatbeds of two trucks hurtling side-by-side through dense monkey-festooned rain forest. LaBeouf who makes his entrance on a Harley (striking a Marlon Brando Wild One pose) turns out to be the son of Raiders sweetie Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen in a sunny reprise). And if the franchise drags on into subsequent decades the young actor has clearly been designated the heir to Indys bullwhip. But whether its his American Graffiti pompadour or David Koepps dopey dialogue LaBeouf never quite shakes off a vibe of awkwardness. Like What am I doing here with these guys? The rest of the principal cast is of classy British stock Ray Winstone as Indys not-so-trusty partner John Hurt as the aforementioned Milton-quoting loon and Jim Broadbent as a collegial college don. And if theres any doubt that its Spielberg at the helm check out the sinister G-men (a motif since E.T) or check out well itd be a huge SPOILER to note the other Spielbergian motif running through Crystal Skull - but by no means a huge surprise. While the production values are top-notch and the action artfully choreographed in the end - and quite well before the end - a sense of tedium sets in. Since Raiders Temple of Doom (its cranked-up violence led to the MPAAs implementation of the PG-13 rating) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade there has been lots of similarly neo-nostalgic retro-action fare out of Hollywood. The Mummy movies (a third coming in a couple of months) and the National Treasures too have paid homage to the cliff-hanging action serials of the 1940s that inspired Messrs. Spielberg and Lucas in the first place. Like Indys trademark chapeau theres something a little old about all this digging around in ancient vaults cracking open hoary tombs dodging big boulders and hundreds of bad guys. Old hat that is.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com. Read his blog ""On Movies Online"" at http//go.philly.com/onmovies.

But he may as well be speaking of the anxieties of his dual patriarchs Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Its been 27 years since Indiana Jones first cracked his whip onscreen in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and nearly two decades since the last installment of the franchise ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" The first three Indiana Jones movies came out in a pre-""Spider Man"" pre-""Pirates of the Caribbean"" pre-""Iron Man"" world. Today the serialized blockbuster rules the box office with each entry outdoing the last in terms of hype special effects and pure bombast. The stakes are much higher now and audiences whether new to the franchise or aglow with warm memories of the old films will be expecting much more. Shrewdly Lucas and Spielberg (Lucas executive-produced and Spielberg directed but both filmmakers consciousnesses are clearly at work) meet those expectations by strictly hewing to the established structure of the earlier movies and not attempting to outdo either their previous efforts or their contemporary competition. That there is an outer-space theme to ""The Crystal Skull"" seems fitting as the movie confirms the idea that Indiana Jones exists in its own alternate universe impervious to the passage of time or box office trends with its own unique logic and rules. Indy World is a place you can visit again and again where nothing ever really changes and as this latest tour affirms after two hours youll be quite ready to go home.All the familiar signposts are here the retro B-movie opening set piece; the old-timey graphic of a map charting Indys travels; the winking references to past films. Ever since the second installment (""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"") the movies have been doubly referential harking both to the pulpy action-adventure spy and horror films of the 1930s and 40s and to their own source material. From our first glimpse of Indy (Harrison Ford) in ""The Crystal Skull"" seen as a larger-than-life shadow wearing that now-iconic hat the filmmakers miss no opportunity to put us in an Indiana state of mind hitting the familiar notes (the whip a quip even the snake phobia) early and hard. This time Lucas and Spielberg add additional tips of the fedoras to their own greatest hits. The opening sequence with 1950s teenagers drag-racing in the Nevada desert recalls Lucass ""American Graffiti."" Later Indy says ""I have a bad feeling about this"" echoing the ""Star Wars"" series and the films denouement heavy-handedly mimics ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""Coherent plots have always been secondary to the action in the series. That said this one feels particularly unnecessarily hokey and complex. As in past installments the back story is explained by Jones in passages of leaden exposition that slow the action to a halt. In ""The Crystal Skull"" the characters stop the good professor mouths some mystic mumbo jumbo about ancient civilizations and purloined antiquities everyone nods and then theyre off again to battle Soviet bad guys or contend with a swarm of flesh-eating ants. The story line concerns Indys attempts to locate the skull of the title which allegedly contains supernatural powers before a band of villainous cold war Soviets gets it and return it to its rightful home deep in a South American jungle. (Its interesting to trace the films treatment of the civic-minded archaeologists handling of antiquities. In the earlier films he insisted the looted artifacts belong in museums but here perhaps in response to recent controversies about real-world museums ill-gotten collections the emphasis is on returning the pieces to their native lands.) A certain political correctness pervades this story on the whole; the xenophobia so rampant in the past movies (especially ""Temple of Doom"" with its monkey-brain-eating Indians) has been considerably toned down (though there are still too many grunting natives) and the anti-Orientalism of the first two films in which almost every villain had a turban and a thick generic Middle Eastern accent has been completely jettisoned. But the West Is Best jingoism remains; Indiana taunts the Soviet evildoers by sneering ""I like Ike."" Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Cate Blanchett as icily evil villainess Irina Spalko is largely wasted in a severe black bob and unflattering khaki jumpsuit but the female roles in general are the biggest improvement over the previous films. Karen Allen as Indys long-ago love interest Marion Ravenswood had a nicely tart tongue in ""Raiders"" but spent much of that film screaming for Indy to save her (as did her successors). Here she is actually competent if rather subdued expertly steering a tank through the jungle and keeping the shrieking to a minimum. Shia LaBeouf acquits himself without making a huge impression as Indys son Mutt. (No young actor will measure up to River Phoenix as young Indy in ""The Last Crusade."") Ford does nothing to embarrass himself (though an unfortunate scene where he bickers with Allen over what went wrong in their relationship is cringe-worthy). If all the participants seem at a slight ironic remove from the material its just another way the film stays true to the original. The serial has always been entirely straightforward about its slick shallowness and its reliance on archetype and cliche. Spielberg is an efficient consummately competent director and the action sequences deliver exactly whats promised if nothing more. If there are no gasp-worthy moments of suspense or derring-do there is an economy of bloodshed and gunfire that speaks to the filmmakers inventiveness. In other words the flesh-eating ants are just gross enough.Its hard to say which audience will be better suited to this latest installment. Established Indy fans may find nostalgia clouding their ability to accurately judge ""The Crystal Skull"" in the context of the first films but young viewers who are unfamiliar with the first three will miss a lot of the jokes and may wonder what the fuss is about especially compared to more sophisticated fare. Like Norma Desmond in ""Sunset Boulevard"" Indy is still big; its just that in the new world of movie franchises ""The Crystal Skull"" feels smaller.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (PG-13) Paramount (122 min.) Directed by Steven Spielberg. With Harrison Ford Cate Blanchett Shia LaBeouf Karen Allen. Opens Thursday at 1201 a.m. in New Jersey. THREE AND A HALF STARS In ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" a daring team of professionals risks everything to unearth a valuable artifact. No not a quartz cranium. The ""Indiana Jones"" series. And the great good news is that they succeed marvelously. Nineteen years after he seemingly took on his own ""Last Crusade"" the whip-smart archaeologist is back -- and in fine fighting form as he confronts the Red Menace psychic warfare and his own unsettled past. The belated return is an especially neat time-traveling trick because the ""Indy"" films always existed in two eras simultaneously. The first was the one they were set in and whose Saturday-morning adventure serials they aped -- a 30s world of European spies and lost civilizations of square-jawed heroes and daring hairs-breadth escapes. The second period was the one they were created in -- an 80s era of only minimal CGI and neo-classic filmmaking a time before action films gave in to slow-motion explosions and sped-up fight scenes. And the re-creation of both the Indy world and its style makes this movie doubly nostalgic. The first warm feeling just comes from seeing these characters again -- Harrison Ford fit but acknowledging his age as the intrepid archaeologist and Karen Allen as the one who got away. Spielberg knows our affection for them and gently plays to it -- introducing Indy in bits and pieces (a shot of his hat the shadow of his silhouette) slowly dropping in trademark lines or bits of business for us to smile at. The more lasting enjoyment comes just from relishing Spielbergs filmmaking skills. Long before he became serious and important (and more than occasionally self-important and dull) Spielberg was a master of pacing and action -- a long chase scene here replete with swordfights and leaps from jeep to jeep is the most purely exhilarating bit of filmmaking hes done in years. Oddly the script -- which was endlessly worked on and reworked -- still sometimes feels like it could have used another rewrite. After a fine beginning -- which introduces Area 51 aliens and a KGB agent with a Louise Brooks bob -- the film takes an unsatisfying left turn. The not-particularly-charismatic Shia LeBeouf comes aboard as Indys new sidekick Mutt; a new and slightly confusing plot about crystal skulls and El Dorado requires some major exposition. It stalls the film for awhile and although Spielberg (and story creator George Lucas) have some cliches to fall back on -- when things grow dull bring on the jabbering ""unfriendly natives"" -- theyre beginning to feel a little dubious. Ford is terrific -- unabashedly older and grouchier but still able to throw a sledgehammer of a punch -- but suddenly its the series thats starting to show its age as if it cant quite muster up the energy to go forward. But then Allen reappears as Indys long-lost love and if -- admitted -- she hasnt aged quite as remarkably well as Ford she still has a direct and mischievous gaze. Some fine British character actors -- including John Hurt as a half-mad archaeologist -- show up and Cate Blanchett returns as that KGB agent. And pretty soon the chase is on again and the film is happily back on track. Back to basics too. Although the film explores some of the same family dynamics that ""Last Crusade"" did it avoids the gruesome horrors (and even more gruesome slapstick) of ""Temple of Doom."" Instead it hearkens back to the first film and the very specific elements of retro style it established -- muted colors careful compositions clear editing and an abundance of on-screen maps to always fix the characters in a real place. There are jokey references to other bits of pop culture too although the deeply effortlessly square Spielberg cant help but reach for the most obvious ones -- if a rock record plays it has to be by Elvis or the Everly Brothers; if a teen rebel is introduced of course hes modeled on ""The Wild One"" right down to the cap. (The only unexpected nod -- courtesy of some man-eating ants -- goes to that fun 50s adventure ""The Naked Jungle."") More satisfyingly though Spielberg and Lucas gently rib themselves. The opening shot -- with the Paramount logo dissolving into a dusty gopher mound -- is a tweak of the opening scene of ""Raiders."" The dialogue throughout references the series and long-time fans may detect indulgent salutes to ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters"" as well. The best joke comes at the end though as a quick sequence of shots suggests that Jones may be willing to pass on his role as globe-trotting adventurer -- and then having him snatch back his crown (well crushed fedora) at just the last minute. No Indys not ready to retire -- not yet. And thats good news for all of us. Rating note The film contains violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

For pics of cast members at Sundays Cannes premiere click image. Joe Neumaier Tuesday June 3 2008 115 PM ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is entertaining inventive and old-fashioned in the best way.Steven Spielberg Harrison Ford and company prove they still keep their guts right next to their hearts. The adventuring archaeologists reappearance after 19 years does come with a few curses however. Expectations are high age is inescapable and while its true that theres not much novelty in ""Crystal Skull"" thats okay. Starting with 1981s ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the Indy movies have shown that those who underestimate history do so at their peril. Theres been buzz that the film might be a bomb after an anonymous online reviewers thumbs down made entertainment headlines. And producer George Lucas has said he doesnt expect much positive response. But he has also said he envisions a fifth Indy movie with a younger hero inheriting the whip. While it has flaws this new movie earns its event status. In ""Crystal Skull"" set in 1957 greaser Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) seeks Indy out after their mutual friend Oxley played by John Hurt disappears while in possession of the title artifact a quartz relic that evil Soviet agent Spalko (Cate Blanchett) believes was left by early alien civilizations on Earth. With Mutt as his partner Indy hunts for Oxley and the skull and finds his onetime love Marion Ravenwood - Karen Allen back from ""Raiders"" - who also happens to be Mutts mom. (Whos his dad? Hey even Tarzan found a son.) On the way to a meeting with the skulls ancient E.T. body there are hair-breadth escapes fights and a revelation of mystical power. Sound familiar? Sure it does - thats part of the fun. This film like 1989s ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" follows the template set by ""Raiders"" and continued in the underappreciated ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984) the worst reviewed of the series. ""Raiders"" made 242 million in the U.S. ""Crusade"" 197 million and ""Doom"" 180 million. Theres an early action sequence - here a truck battle in a familiar warehouse - a glimpse of Indy as professor then an explanation of a sought-after objects otherworldly powers along with the obsession with skeletons and bugs plucked from ""Strange Tales"" magazine. Some of it seems a bit dusty but Spielberg remains the master builder - elegant chase scenes are constructed perfectly and without overediting or confusion. In an era of CGI thrills Blanchett and LaBeoufs sword duel atop moving jeeps and Indys fistfight with a handful of thugs are like watching an ancient art reborn. Screenwriter David Koepp (""Jurassic Park"") has a knack for sneaking character development into the action beats - a lot about Indys past is revealed if you listen - and the film riffs on 1950s pressure points like Communism UFOs and nuclear testing. Ford at 65 may not have the looks anymore but his weathered take on the old formula works. LaBeouf is more of a cartoon though he permanently stakes his claim to stardom; and Allens Marion is still tough and appealing. The chameleon Blanchett with her posture imposingly rigid and her face like a V-shaped alien etching needed to be more villainous. Dr. Jones (called ""Henry"" for much of the movie) deserves foes who are cunning and scary. Yet did he deserve to stay buried in the cinema of the 1980s? Nah. Like any good myth Indiana Jones shows up when hes needed. Great to have him back. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Does it live up to them? How could it? The experience of watching Crystal Skull is similar to that of seeing the present-day Rolling Stones in concert. Theres no question that the production is first-rate the skill honed and professional and the principals are having a ball. But itll never match the rag-tag excitement and originality of the old days. Director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas the masterminds behind all the Indy movies (and so much more) acknowledge the build-up and attempt to cleverly mute it in the first frames of the film. Remember in Raiders of the Lost Ark when the mountain in the Paramount logo fades into an actual mountain? In Crystal Skull it fades into . . . the pile of dirt atop a prairie dogs home. Not quite a mountain to a molehill but about as close as you can get. This is not to say that there arent chase scenes fights involving unlikely properties of physics and all-around action galore (aliens anyone?). Its to say that its all tempered a bit both by age (Harrison Ford is 65 though he certainly doesnt look it) and the off-the-charts anticipation for a franchise that hasnt seen a new chapter in 19 years. While individual scenes and segments of Crystal Skull are quite entertaining and very well done they add up to not so much an actual movie as a victory lap a tip of the fedora by Speilberg Lucas and Ford to the films that went before them. Its like a greatest-hits tour. If you loved the first three movies - who didnt? - youll smile warmly at the glimpse of the Lost Ark for instance a nice little callback. But youll also likely groan at the predictability of the plot on those occasions when the plot makes any sense at all. The film begins with a rumpled Jones - like the audience he too is 19 years older - captured and forced to help Soviet bad guys find the location of a certain box in the endless warehouse we saw at the end of Raiders. Heh - not just bad guys. Bad girl too the main villain is Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) whose accent and haircut suggest that she wandered in off the set of a Bullwinkle cartoon though thats not such a bad thing in a movie like this. Spielberg goes a little overboard with the Indys-older bit but at least were not meant to think hes still a young man - a point driven home plenty once he meets up with Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) who barrels into the film a dead ringer for Marlon Brando in The Wild Ones right down to the cap tilted at a jaunty angle. Hes got news for Jones whos under suspicion for helping Spalko and it involves trouble for Professor Oxley (John Hurt) who helped raise Mutt. Before long Indy and Mutt are traveling the world looking for a crystal skull of lore which if returned to its rightful resting place will bestow its powers upon the person who takes it there. Or something. Even for an Indiana Jones movie its a bit much. But trying to find it and then return it gives Spielberg all sorts of excuses to hatch over-the-top action sequences the best of which - a sword fight between Mutt and Spalko while standing atop side-by-side jeeps barreling down jungle roads for instance - invoke memories of Ford doing similarly crazy things at full throttle in the earlier films. The worst - Mutt swinging from vines with monkeys looking like Tarzan starring in a road-company production of Grease - are just kind of silly. Along the way they run into Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) Indys flame from the first film who has lost none of her spunk. She has gained a son and while you wont get any spoilers here it doesnt take a genius to figure out where that particular plot thread is leading. Also keep in mind that Spielberg likes to throw a little family drama into most of his films. By the end Crystal Skull has taken on entirely new dimensions literally. The door remains open either for another Indy adventure or for Mutt to pick up the bullwhip and carry on the tradition. Its simple really. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull plays heavily on the fondness of the audience for the first three films. Without that its basically a better-made version of the National Treasure series. It doesnt mean that the audience cant enjoy it just that it doesnt break enough new ground to carry the franchise further. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Indiana Jones review A good ride for old times sake - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Indiana Jones review A good ride for old times sake Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic There were a dozen good reasons to not do a fourth Indiana Jones movie.Hes an icon like James Bond so he should never age. Harrison Fords too old to pull it off. Times and tastes have changed. But theres one very good reason to do it a sentimental one for old times sake.So it is that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull shows up as Indiana Jones Greatest Hits recycling sequences from the terrific 1980s trilogy re-using that splendid jaunty John Williams score reminiscing over cast members not on board this time or no longer with us Ford muttering ""Ive got a bad feeling about this"" one more time. Is that enough of a reason to see it? You bet your bullwhip it is. Ford now 65 may have lost a step but this Indy lets him age out of the role with grace and style. Watch the moment early on when Indy runs into old flame Marion Ravenwood ( Karen Allen). The look of unalloyed joy on Fords face may be the best acting moment hes ever had. Steven Spielberg hasnt gained more skills as a director and series creator George Lucas is a shell of the writer he once was (thus others scripted this from his story). But Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is still an old-fashioned two-fisted romp through archaeology the Cold War pseudo-science and film history.Its 1957 and Indy and sidekick Mac (Ray Winstone) have been kidnapped by ruthless Russkies led by a sword-wielding Stalinist played by Cate Blanchett. Indy is needed to help track down a crate in Area 51 because this is Indy Meets The X-Files.The Russians were big on paranormal warfare experiments and they need the flinty college professor to help them track down this skull and a lost Amazonian city filled with such skulls. Indy has no trouble hating Commies even though college professors like himself were quick to be labeled ""security risks."" ""I like Ike"" he growls at his captors.One harrowing escape follows another as Dr. Jones meets Mutt ( Shia LaBeouf) a kid who has seen Brandos The Wild One and made himself into a carbon-copy biker urging Indy to help save an old friend a fellow academic (John Hurt) who has been kidnapped with the kids mom all being held by those murderous Russians.LaBeouf and Ford have an easy rapport with the sassy kid landing most of the ""geezer"" one-liners.""For an old man you aint bad in a fight. What are you like 80?""Allens as perky and plucky as ever and the presence of Oscar winners Blanchett (reminiscent of Bond villains of the 60s) and Jim Broadbent (as the new college colleague who looks out for Indy now that Denholm Elliott is dead) class up the picture. Hurt has made a career of playing deranged wrecks.The motorcycle stunts are roller-coaster-ride fun the big brawls as big as we remember them with only a hint of digital augmentation. The plot takes in atomic testing the Plains of Nazca Chariots of the Gods and the Red Scare. The dialogue only rarely lapses into a real groaner. Its a jokey movie equal parts Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade not as good as the first not quite as much fun as the last.But theres also a hint of wistfulness over missed opportunities reunions delayed lost chances to make the big broad world and the lives of two little people better.When Professor Oxley (Hurt) laments ""How much of human life is lost in waiting?"" hes talking about movie fans who have longed for this chance to remember all that Indy was and could be. Of all the tricks those magical crystal skulls manage in this movie none is more welcome or more satisfying than this the gift of ""closure.""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel Indiana Jones (fictional character) Colleges and Universities Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (movie) Steven Spielberg Roger Moore Movies Jim Broadbent Karen Allen makes her return to Indyworld Upcoming Movie Releases Search movie reviews database Pulse ShootingAll SectionsNewsSportsBusinessClassifiedEntertainmentTravel84deg","http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-bk-indiana-jones-review-skull-051908,0,4270425.story",200,theskulls28,theskulls,orlandosentinel
"New Indiana Jones among series best | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNew Indiana Jones among series best Not great cinema but its great fun and good to have old friends back.Harrison Ford and offscreen leading lady actor Calista Flockhart.  (FRANCOIS MORI / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticMon. May 19 2008CANNES France-You know youre dealing with Indy-sized entertainment when surviving an atomic bomb blast is a minor plot point.Harrison Fords intrepid archeologist manages this feat and much more in his stirring new relic hunt Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Indy IV for short) which had its global debut at the Cannes Film Festival yesterday in advance of its Thursday theatrical release.But a greater threat awaits offscreen the impossibly high expectations of fans who have been jonesing for 19 years for the fourth instalment of this beloved adventure franchise.Whether Indy wriggles out of that scrape depends on viewers counting their blessings rather than quibbling over details. Moviegoers will likely find as many critics did here that Indy IV is great fun without necessarily being great cinema.Its a solid summer blockbuster in other words just like its three predecessors. Article Continued BelowAll involved in it are working at the top of their game director Steven Spielberg series mastermind George Lucas screenwriters David Koepp (Spider-Man Jurassic Park) and Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can) plus actors both familiar (Ford Karen Allen) and new to the series (Cate Blanchett Shia LaBeouf Ray Winstone and John Hurt).Think of Indy IV as a toy crafted by expert jewellers and you wont be far off the mark even if its theme is - on the face of it - anything but childs play.The story is set in 1957 post-World War II and in the thick of paranoia over the Cold War and ""Red Menace"" atomic aggression McCarthy witch hunts and celestial visitations from little grey men.Add to this some heavy mythology about supernatural crystal skulls in a temple deep within the South American jungle and you have a very convoluted plot one that might leave kids (and Indy newcomers) scratching their noggins. (Note to parents melting faces and man-eating ants may make this a little too intense for tots.)But what a pleasure it is to watch all this talent at work and play. Rather than pretend Indy hasnt aged a day since he rode off into the sunset at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade the story capitalizes on the good humour of Ford 65 and Allen 56 reuniting as older and not necessarily wiser versions of the squabbling romancers they played in Raiders of the Lost Ark the 1981 series debut.They both look great better than most people their age and the movie is also a triumph of old-school artistry Spielberg insisted that most of the heroics be done for real using stunt performers rather than CGI so Indy IV retains the same feel as movies made in the pre-digital age. So does the familiar Indiana Jones theme by John Williams which you will undoubtedly be whistling as you exit the theatre.Yet the film introduces some welcome new faces. LaBeouf Hollywoods hot It Boy is terrific as Mutt the motorbike-riding and switchblade-snapping greaser who teams with Jones in twin quests for lost friends and family and also for the meaning of the crystal skulls. LaBeouf would make an excellent successor to Ford should the Indiana Jones series continue without the original man in the fedora.Blanchett she of a thousand faces and voices follows her stellar Bob Dylan impersonation of Im Not There with sexy sword-swishing KGB villain Irina Spalko for whom obtaining the crystal skulls is both a matter of career advancement and intellectual curiosity.British journeymen Ray Winstone and John Hurt are good fun in their respective roles of George ""Mac"" McHale and Prof. ""Ox"" Oxley old Indy accomplices who get their pal into and out of trouble.The whip doesnt always snap sharply. As nice as it is to see Allen reprising her role as Marion Ravenwood who loves both Indy and adventure her screen time is brief (she doesnt show up until near the one-hour mark) and her role is awkward and underwritten.Theres also a feeling of deja vu about the story partly because its the fourth time around for Indy partly because the best gags have already been used for the trailer and partly because so many similar movie adventurers have followed in Indys wake. The second half of Indy IV seems a lot like the second half of the recent National Treasure sequel and the movie also has some of the campy tone of The Pirates of the Caribbean series. Theres even a nod to Caddyshack in a running gag about curious gophers.But the two previous sequels Temple of Doom and Last Crusade also seemed less fresh than the original Raiders of the Lost Ark which was intended as an homage to 1930s movie serials. For those keeping score at home Id rank Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as a tie for second place in the series on a par with Last Crusade and above Temple of Doom while falling a respectable distance short of the high mark set by Raiders.In short Indy IV may not entirely be the grand return that everyone had hoped for but its still great to see a good old friend come around again.

""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" which premiered yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival is often thrilling sometimes charming occasionally clunky family entertainment that perhaps wisely doesnt attempt to scale the heights of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Indy Queen Jones Lady Back for More Loving Wheres Shia LaBeouf? On a satisfaction scale it lands squarely between ""The Temple of Doom"" and ""The Last Crusade"" the second and third installments of the original trilogy conceived by Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg. Fans of the series - you can include me - will lap it up flaws and all and likely make it the summers biggest blockbuster. The filmmakers seem to signal relatively modest ambitions with the wry first shot which has the mountain of the Paramount logo dissolving into a literal molehill. A graying and slightly mellowed Harrison Ford in very fine form again dons Indys fedora and picks up his whip as the archeologist adventurer. While hes solidly middle-aged - the subject of more than one joke - and the years have moved along to 1957 Spielberg and Lucas dont mess with a winning formula in this very eager-to-please follow-up. As we open Indy and a colleague of dubious loyalty (Ray Winstone) are captives of KGB agents led by Soviet parapsychologist Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett in a Louise Brooks bob and skirting the edge of camp). The Russkies take Indy to the same vast Nevada warehouse seen at the end of the ""Lost Ark"" (which makes a fleeting cameo appearance) in search of an extraterrestrial artifact. After the first of several well-mounted chase sequences that climaxes in a nuclear explosion (arguably the most original touch in the entire movie) Indy has returned to the classroom and is being shadowed by a pair of red-hunting FBI agents. An encounter with a not-so-mysterious young man named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) leads to an even more spectacular chase through the streets of New Haven. Shortly theyre off to Peru in search of the lost city of Eldorado and the titular crystal skull whose powers promise to dwarf those of the ark. I wont give away much more - which is explained in far too much expository dialogue - except to report they also find Irina as well as Indys old flame from ""Raiders"" the oft-jilted Marion Ravenwood. For me Karen Allens return to her signature role after 27 years alone justifies this sequel even if - or maybe because - their relationship proceeds precisely as youd expect right up to a fade-up that had me misting up. Although hes not always totally convincing as a motorcycle-riding switchboard-toting tough guy LaBeouf fares far better than Hayden Christensen in the ""Star Wars"" prequels. Was anybody really expecting the fourth film in a series made after a 19-year layoff to be a masterpiece? I wasnt. Im just glad that ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" doesnt disgrace the memory of ""Raiders of The Lost Ark."" That it manages to do a bit more than that is probably an accomplishment. lou.lumenicknypost.com INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL Running time 123 minutes.

SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE INDIANA JONES INDEXIndy 5? Dont hold your breathThe skull Indy relic has storied pastQuiz See how much you know about Indiana Appeal Hes Everyman with wit and whipCompare See how the films stack up Review Indy still wields plenty of snapMore By Claudia Puig USA TODAY It has been nearly two decades and Indiana Jones is a bit more grizzled. But his witty banter is still decidedly intact. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (  1/2 out of four) he uses his wits and still-considerable brawn to fend off an atomic bomb ruthless KGB agents roiling rapids flesh-eating insects and angry Peruvian natives. And he tangles again with his most hated nemesis the snake. AT CANNES Indiana Jones gets a thumbs up from youngest critic CALENDAR Summer movie season at a glance Right about the time the natives get restless however so do we. But the excitement picks back up and overall its pleasantly nostalgic to see Harrison Ford as Jones again. Ford seems to have taken the 19 years since the third Jones in smooth stride. He remains dashing in his weathered fedora and he can still snap a bullwhip with finesse. Still much fun is had particularly by Shia LaBeoufs character with Jones having grown a bit long in the tooth. Teaming Ford with Transformers LaBeouf and reuniting him with Karen Allen were inspired choices. Less so is Cate Blanchett whos over-the-top as an evil Russian scientist with the thickest accent since Bullwinkles Natasha. The stunts and special effects are spectacular as one would expect from director Steven Spielberg. A motorcycle chase across the grounds of an Ivy League college is a treat and Jones tosses off some of his best lines. But while its an intentionally far-fetched saga there are especially implausible moments -- even for Indiana Jones. Characters suddenly stand still for instance so special effects can happen around them. It was 1938 when we last saw archaeology professor Jones just before World War II. Now its 1957 the Cold War is on the world seems on the brink of nuclear annihilation and Communists are being hunted down. Though previous installments focused on the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail this time its a crystal skull that is significant historically and cosmically. Sounds overheated and it is. Ridiculous exchanges dont help. When LaBeouf asks if some creatures are from outer space he is told ""Not outer space. But the space between spaces."" Huh? But even with the ponderous dialogue its hard not to have fun on this adventure and its good to see that Indy though slightly weary still has the goods.

Raiders redux - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Raiders redux Crystal Skull recaptures the franchises youth Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / May 18 2008 No its not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Dont be silly. Lightning cant be bottled twice no matter how skilled the vintners.Instead Steven Spielbergs Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is merely grand old-school fun -- a rollicking class reunion that stands as the second best entry in the venerable series. Premiering yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival and opening worldwide on Thursday the new movie is leagues better than 1984s nasty Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and blessed with more snap and heart -- more fun -- then 1989s pro forma Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. All thats lacking is a genuine sense of surprise. Its very possible that was left out on purpose.The emphasis in Crystal Skull is on old-fashioned stunt work rather than the shiny chimeras of modern digital effects. When Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) catapults from the back of a motorcycle through the window of a speeding car out the opposite window and back onto the motorcycle -- his feet nervously skitching along the roadbed -- at least half the excitement is knowing that motorcycle car Ford and road are real.Thankfully the approach goes only so far. Character and star may have aged two decades since the last installment but bullets still miss the good guys with astonishing regularity and Indiana Jones may be the only person who could escape a desert nuclear test site with an A-bomb due to land in 10 seconds. How he manages this makes no blessed sense but its a hoot anyway.That scene occurs in the movies first 15 minutes in the sort of fast-charging prologue Spielberg and producer George Lucas know were expecting. The sequence also establishes the time (1957) the enemy (Russian Communists) and the stakes (power over all of mankind -- the usual).Better it reintroduces Indy as a believably older but still absurdly capable figure out of a Saturday matinee serial and it brings on Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko a Red menace with a sword a Louise Brooks bob and a nifty accent by way of Natasha in the old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons. Drop dead comrade the hero sneers at Irina and thats a good description of the best Indiana Jones villain yet Shes a drop-dead comrade.To sum up the plot of Crystal Skull requires dancing around a number of spoilers so stop reading now if you want to go in with a clean slate. What Spalko and her KGB minions are after is a rare and very strange crystal skull that legends say was stolen from El Dorado the lost city of gold in Peru. One of Indianas colleagues Professor Oxley (John Hurt) has set out to find it and disappeared and a young man named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) arrives to beg Jones to rescue his old friend. This being the 50s Mutt is first seen riding a motorcycle with his cap askew just like Marlon Brando in The Wild One. Hes a preppie who has dropped out to become a greaser instead of a beatnik and the sequence in which he and Indiana career through the college campus (inside the library and out) with Russians in high-speed pursuit is an early high point.Its bookended later in the film by a delirious action set piece involving multiple jeeps a sheer cliff face monkeys vines and a ravenous army of giant ants. (This last leads to one of the few gross-out scenes in Skull which is noticeably less gruesome than the other sequels. Its still a bit too spooky in places for young children.)The basic structure of these action scenes hasnt changed in 20 years but camera technology and Spielbergs skill at deploying it have. Theres an organic smoothness to the mayhem that can take your breath away so much so that the less inspired aspects of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull stick out more clearly.Its wonderful for instance to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion Ravenwood from Raiders since her warmth was precisely what was missing from the first two sequels. (Let us now officially forget all about Kate Capshaw and the unfortunate Alison Doody.) The script doesnt give Allen quite enough to do though and the family dynamics that take over the last third of the movie feel overly familiar.Indeed a number of Spielberg career threads are woven into Skull including a climactic shot that blatantly rehashes the finale of one of the directors best-loved early films. While Ford wears the fedora with believably weathered panache on some level this Indy seems smaller less archetypal than his younger incarnation. Where the character once towered over these movies now hes just the leader of the pack.The rest of the cast keeps pace -- Ray Winstone as an accomplice who may or may not be a betrayer Jim Broadbent taking over for the late Denholm Elliott as Indys college friend. LaBeouf has an interesting alertness that he still hasnt figured out how to use as an actor but he throws himself into the stunt work like a proper student at the feet of the masters.It bears asking though What do we want from an Indiana Jones movie in 2008? Engaged nostalgia I think and on that level Crystal Skull delivers. This isnt a reinvention but a reunion of characters creators even techniques. Same old same old Jones says at one point and thats what we get. The action may have been updated to the 1950s but in ways both inspired and unexamined Indiana Jones remains happily stuck in the 80s.

"Review Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Review Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull Lucasfilm Lucasfilm Kenneth TuranTimes Movie Critic Its the summers most anticipated film the latest in a beloved series thats earned 1.2 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Add in a premiere at the most prestigious of international film festivals and the wonder of ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is that it avoids being an anticlimax and is entertaining in its own right.Though the film stars a relaxed and capable Harrison Ford as everyones favorite intrepid archaeologist and boasts supporting players ranging from Cate Blanchett as a superb villainess to Shia LaBeouf as the inevitable youngster the real heroes of this film are director Steven Spielberg and the veritable army of superb technicians who turn the films numerous stunts and special effects into trains that insist on running on time. Trains are in fact not a bad metaphor for the directors motivations for this fourth Indy effort the first in 19 years. Just like a model-train hobbyist who enjoys getting more and more expensive equipment as his income level rises Spielberg clearly got enormous pleasure employing a lifetimes worth of skill and turning out wave after wave of smartly done stunts and effects set pieces.Certainly ""Crystal Skull"" which hits theaters in the U.S. this Thursday couldnt have had a more eager not to say rabid audience anywhere in the world than the one at the Cannes Film Festival for its pair of Sunday screenings. The chaos at the press entrance was remarkable at the first screening with frantic cinephiles pushing shoving attempting to jump over barriers and engaging in fierce shouting matches with the guards. And inside the normally decorous Grand Theatre Lumiere where the festivals closing ceremony is held there was unprecedented cheering as the opening credits rolled. Getting sole screenplay credit (with story credit going to series originator George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson) was the veteran David Koepp the latest and most successful of the close to a dozen people who took a crack at this project over 15 years according to an article in the WGAs Written By magazine. The result may not be as iconic as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but its a perfectly agreeable outline on which to hang what with a budget estimated at 185 million must be the most expensive Saturday matinee film ever made.Koepps script also had to get the approval of Harrison Ford who probably enjoyed getting to play his own age in a story set at the height of the Red scare in 1957 when Marshall Colleges Professor Jones believe it or not runs afoul of the FBI and has his patriotism questioned. Though perhaps ambivalent at one time about Indy typecasting Ford has made his peace with one of his most iconic roles and seeing him at his ease here is like meeting an old friend after years away.If Ford is a known Indy quantity newcomer Blanchett is a great treat as Colonel Professor Irina Spalko three-time winner of the Order of Lenin and ""Stalins fair-haired girl"" despite a jet-black hairdo a la Louise Brooks.The Colonel Professor and a crack team of Russians manage to force their way into a secret U.S. Army base in Nevada as the film begins. They bring the kidnapped Jones with them and force him at gunpoint to help them find some mummified remains from a plane crash that are stored in a giant government warehouse the same one incidentally that was featured in the ending of ""Raiders."" (Here its built for real; in the original it was a special effect). The mummified remains have a connection to the crystal skull of the title and both deeply interest the C.P. who is a believer in paranormal research as ""a new frontier in psychic warfare."" She feels if she can find where the skull came from great knowledge will be hers.Naturally the temple turns out to be deep in the South American jungle and no surprise here not at all easy to get to.If the opening Nevada segment which quite literally ends with a bang complete with realistic mushroom cloud is one of the films strengths the exposition-heavy middle section is something of a drag. Thats partially because Indys sidekicks including Ray Winstone as George ""Mac"" MacHale and John Hurt as Professor ""Ox"" Oxley (you may detect a pattern here) are no better than serviceable.That is true as well for LaBeouf as youth interest Mutt Williams. Introduced as a total copy of Marlon Brando on a motorcycle in ""The Wild One"" LaBeouf doesnt seem completely comfortable in his disaffected teen role a part that does not play to the innate likability that is one of his strengths.And though it is exceptionally pleasant to see Karen Allen returning as Indy flame Marion Ravenwood the film is too intent on spending the first part of their reunion having them strenuously argue with each other. Its so unpleasant even one of the atheist Russians is forced to plead ""For love of God shut the hell up."" The films final section however with everyone hell-bent for the temple and the secret of that eggplant-shaped crystal skull makes up for lost time. It offers lots of animal action (monkeys and hordes of red ants primarily) as well as great stunts both CGI (""Look out for those falls"") and physical as the Colonel Professor and Mutt draw swords and make like Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in ""Captain Blood.""When you think about it all the pre-release concern about just how good the new ""Indy"" was going to be though understandable is not completely rational. After all given its Saturday matinee genre nature and the fact that star Ford creator Lucas director Spielberg composer John Williams and editor Michael Kahn among others have all returned it was inevitable that this film was going to fall within a very narrow range in terms of quality. It was either going to be a worse- or better-than-average Indiana Jones film. It turns out its one of the better ones and everyone involved can breathe a sigh of relief.kenneth.turanlatimes.com""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""

"Indiana Jones 4 full of action but forgets to have a good time - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Indiana Jones 4 full of action but forgets to have a good timeMay 19 2008|By Michael Phillips Tribune criticCANNES France a Really it would have been fantastic if the new Indiana Jones movie had turned out gangbusters. Failing that a good solid sequel would have been nice -- proof that a handsomely graying collection of world-class cinematic entertainers both behind and in front of a defiantly non-digital camera were right to haul out the fedora and the bullwhip for one more adventure.But the movie with the title that does not know when to quit ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" does not know when to quit. Nor does it extract much fun from a cockamamie story provided by George Lucas involving aliens the lost golden city of El Dorado the Red Menace and the greaser-kid (played by Shia LaBeouf) Indy never knew he had (though the globe-trotting archeologist is certainly the last in the film to figure that out).Even with Cate Blanchett refusing to blink even once and Natasha Fatale-ing her way through the role of a Soviet mind-control expert with the worst haircut since Ish Kabibble ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is so nervous about falling into the quicksands of camp that it forgets to deliver a good time. ""Same old same old"" mutters Harrison Ford during a pause in the derring-do in this disappointingly humorless sequel which premiered in an out-of-competition slot Sunday here at the Cannes Film Festival. Same old same old is right.Nineteen years have passed since ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" which apparently now must be retitled ""Indiana Jones and the Second-to-Last Crusade"" sent Indy and his dad played by Sean Connery off into the sunset. Connery did not return for ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" but Karen Allen is back as Indys sparring partner Marion the one who ran the Himalayan saloon and never quit arguing. She and Indy pick right up where they left off arguing.The new film begins in 1957 Nevada. On an Air Force nuclear test site the Russians force a kidnapped Indy and his colleague (played by Ray Winstone) to locate a crystal skull inside a vast warehouse (holding that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" thingie still). The crystal skull comes from Out There -- take that upcoming ""X Files"" movie -- and holds the key to eternal power and limitless knowledge. The rest of the skulls are down south so Indy and his nemeses high-tail it down to Peru down the Amazon down into sand pits anthills with giant speedy killer ants over three waterfalls one after another.Theres no lack of activity in ""Crystal Skull."" Its soundstage interiors (mixed in with the location shooting) carries a reassuringly fakey air and they are lit by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski with so much pearly white light the characters threaten to turn into Stanley Kubricks Star Children. But in between frenetic action scenes you have to endure treasure-hunting exchanges such as the malt-shop dialogue between Indy and the kid Mutt (LaBeouf) whose first appearance on a motorcycle rips off Brando in ""The Wild One."" The dialogue doesnt even try to make its story points with any flair. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Exposition"" is more like it.That sequence devolves into a greasers-versus-jocks melee that director Steven Spielberg cuts away from as quickly as possible. The films best action sequence follows however and tellingly its also the simplest involving Ford and LaBeouf on a motorcycle being pursued by Russkies. For five minutes ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" relies on old-style kinetics and a couple of sharply executed stunts involving Indy climbing off and on the motorcycle.That scene knows what its doing but a lot of the picture veers uneasily between solemnity and slapstick and 47 different genres. One second were treated to Russians on fire; a few seconds later its comic relief reaction shots of computer-generated prairie dogs. Indy stumbles onto a nuclear test site (echoes of the old Mickey Rooney vehicle from the 50s ""The Atomic Kid"") and survives an A-bomb attack. Queasy stuff and Spielbergs touch is unsure; somethings off in this scene. It doesnt jibe with attempts at old-school cliffhanging such as Blanchetts ""Captain Blood"" duel with LaBeouf. By the time Blanchetts suffering the wrath of aliens those who remember ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) may be thinking been there melted that.And John Hurt As the addlebrained holy fool who guides his old pal Indy to where the skulls are he must say with a straight face ""No more forever waiting. Soon now."" So they couldnt get Connery but they made room for Yoda? ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is not slovenly in terms of craft but this script fails its interpreters utterly. Indiana Jones -- lets be honest -- never was a memorable movie character. He was however a sturdy vessel for our nostalgia and for Spielbergs ability to shine up old serialized goods. This time same old same old. Would that sequel No. 3 were as stylish as that fedora.MPAA rating PG-13 (for adventure violence and scary images).Running time 203.Opening 1201 a.m. Thursday.Starring Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones); Cate Blanchett (Irina Spalko); Shia LaBeouf (Mutt Williams); Karen Allen (Marion); Ray Winstone (Mac Michale).Directed by Steven Spielberg; written by David Koepp; story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson; photographed by Janusz Kaminski; edited by Michael Kahn; music by John Williams; production design by Guy Hendrix Dyas; produced by Frank Marshall and Denis L.

The cocky kid (who demonstrates an awful lot of Indiana Jones spirit in his swagger) calls himself Mutt and is played with a kick by Shia LaBeouf. The oldie doesnt need to tell anyone that hes Indiana Jones full-time whiz with a bullwhip and first-rate advertisement for the sex appeal of a good hat. In the person of a more gracious less sour Harrison Ford than weve seen recently 80 is a lighthearted code for the new graying-but-potent 65 an age that rarely allows female stars to joke about the effects of time but suits the manly star of the franchise like a supple leather jacket. The truth is that this particular action hero has always come across as a seasoned bird even when audiences first met him nearly 27 years ago. What Indy has been doing since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a bit of a muddle in Steven Spielbergs nostalgia-fueled national holiday of a sequel. And so for that matter is the origin of the cranium under pursuit and its place in the mythology of an extinct civilization. Instead of clarity we are treated to airy philosophizing such as when one character with a Yoda-like flourish refers to the ancients relationship to ""the space between the spaces."" We do know that its the Cold War 1950s. Indy has been kidnapped at the behest of the power-mad slinky Soviet femme fatale Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett vamping in a formfitting gray uniform that Garbos Ninotchka might have coveted). Irina wants him to help find the skull because its the key to mind-controlling knowledge. Mutt meanwhile wants Indy to help him find his missing mother -- this wouldnt be a Spielberg saga if some young person werent longing to repair a family -- and offers archaeological lures as a job incentive. Anyhow if Indy is a salty coot the movie sticks to the old ways too. At its best its a satisfying shuffle of the deck of famous Spielbergian moments that have gone before in E.T. Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The first 20 minutes especially are a blast of old-timey pleasure as Indy is reintroduced Irina is unveiled and the production team shows what the king of witty action can do when he floors it. In a great dark joke a lovingly re-created suburban tract straight out of E.T. turns out to be a Potemkin village of mannequins awaiting vaporization during an atom-bomb test. That still leaves over 100 minutes to fill though. And so everybody runs through their chase paces Theres Indy Mutt Indys feisty former sweetie Marion Ravenwood (hooray for Karen Allen) Indys bonkers former mentor (John Hurt) various villains double agents monkeys tribal gentlemen skeletons voracious ants and of course a snake or two (why did it have to be snakes?). Before long The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull becomes a reminder of the finite pleasures of Spielbergs particular Indiana Jones bag of tricks no matter how bulging with technical elegance the satchel. Janusz Kaminskis cinematography is crystalline but David Koepps unsubtle screenplay is considerably less brilliant maybe because his attempts at conveying the gee-whiz rhythms of atomic-age times are overwhelmed by the requirement to convey information about whos chasing whom where and why. The skull may be transparent but the plot is murky as hell. Of course theres no question whos going to win. Indy represents the wisecracking capitalist West and hes battling Irina (the humorless totalitarian East) for possession of what looks after all like a Plexiglas football with oversized eye sockets. Any faint interestingly acrid whiff of commentary on 1950s political conservatism -- and its application to our own era -- is forcibly stamped out. In this revival of the Indiana Jones franchise everything is new and nothing is new. The movies legacy may simply be the melee that ensues when Spielberg cracks the whip and moviegoers scurry for tickets.

Related Cannes Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Woody Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Early in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull -- which had its tumultuous world premiere today at the Cannes Film Festival -- our hero (Harrison Ford) and his sometime pal Mac (Ray Winstone) come up against a convoy of tough Russians. ""This aint gonna be easy"" Mac says and Indy replies ""Not as easy as it used to be."" The old-guy jokes are as true for director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas as for the star. Its 27 years since Raiders of the Lost Ark started the Jones boy on his adventures 19 years since the most recent Indy movie The Last Crusade and 30 years this month since Lucas and Spielberg sat on a Hawaiian beach and made a handshake deal for an action film that one would produce and the other direct. Theyd be stupid to ignore the toll that time takes on moviemakers and movie stars. All were in their 30s when they made Raiders. Now Spielberg Lucas and Ford are respectively 61 64 and 65. And dont forget two other crucial collaborators composer John Williams and editor Michael Kahn who have given all the Indy films their cheerfully martial sound and cut-to-the-bone fury. There are scenes in the new movie that seem like stretching exercises at a retirement home; there are garrulous stretches and even the title seems a few words too long. But once it gets going Crystal Skull delivers smart robust familiar entertainment. Ford looks just fine his chest skin tanned to a rich Corinthian leather; hes still lithe on his feet and can deliver a wisecrack as sharp as a whipcrack. Karen Allen 56 who was Indys saucy love Marion Ravenwood in Raiders still has that glittering smile and vestiges of her old elfin swagger. They neednt break a sweat keeping up with the (relative) kids 39-year-old Cate Blanchett the movies villainess and Shia LaBeouf who plays the young lead Mutt Williams and who may be tapped to continue the series after Fords retirement -- at least thats what Lucas hinted a few days ago here in Cannes. Crystal Skull is intended and works effectively as instant nostalgia -- a class reunion of the old gang who in the 80s reinvigorated the classic action film with such expertise and brio. So dont expect the freshness of the what-one-man-can-do plot in Iron Man or the oneiric visuals of Speed Racer. Spielberg and Lucas and screenwriters David Koepp and Jeff Nathanson are looking not forward but back to the first three films. They know that moviegoers would be disappointed not to see the talismans of Indys past reappear here. Shall we itemize? 1. The Paramount logo dissolves into some kind of mountain. Every Indy films opens this way from one monument to another. (As Veronica Geng wrote in a review of the first movie ""Spielberg"" is German for ""play mountain."") In Raiders the logo became a mountain in South America; in the second film Temple of Doom a bas-relief on a Chinese gong; in The Last Crusade a big boulder in Utah. This time suggesting more modest aspirations or maybe kiddingly deflecting the audiences gargantuan expectations its a weeny prairie dog hill from which a critter emerges just before being nearly run over by speeding cars. Were in Nevada near Area 51 and its 1957 a time of rock n roll (Elviss ""Hound Dog"" on the soundtrack) fear of the Soviets (and why not? theyve just penetrated a U.S. military base) fear of The Bomb (hey whats that mushroom cloud on the horizon?) and mass sightings of UFOs (coming right up). 2. International conspiracies. Nazis in the first and third Indys Indian Thugees in the second. But it wouldnt be the 50s without Commies in the chic person of Irina Spalko (played by Blanchett with the severe demeanor of Cyd Charisses Ninotchka in the 1957 MGM musical Silk Stockings and the black bob Charisse sports in The Band Wagon). Rather than the simple matter of conquering the West militarily Irina is part of a Soviet plot to cloud our minds by getting access to some secret technology that is concealed either in an Area 51 warehouse or in the remotest jungle mountains of Peru. ""We will change you Mr. Jones all of you from the inside"" she proclaims. ""We will turn you into us."" Ewww creepy. Glad that didnt happen.

One of the most eagerly and long-awaited series follow-ups in screen history delivers the goods -- not those of the still first-rate original 1981s ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but those of its uneven two successors. ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" begins with an actual big bang then gradually slides toward a ho-hum midsection before literally taking off for an uplifting finish. Nineteen years after their last adventure director Steven Spielberg and star Harrison Ford have no trouble getting back in the groove with a story and style very much in keeping with what has made the series so perennially popular. Few films have ever had such a high mass audience must-see factor spelling giant May 22 openings worldwide and a rambunctious B.O. life all the way into the eventual ""Indiana Jones"" DVD four-pack. As has been well chronicled Spielberg and exec producer George Lucas went through no end of writers and story concepts before plausibly updating the action precisely the same number of years as have elapsed since ""Last Crusade"" to 1957 smack dab in the middle of the Cold War. U.S. versus USSR dynamic spurs the dynamite opening action sequence in which a convoy of Russian soldiers camouflaged in American army vehicles rolls into a remote desert nuclear testing base in search of a coveted object. Helping them in this effort will be their prisoner Indiana Jones. With an energy and enthusiasm bespeaking years of pent-up desire to get back to this sort of fun filmmaking Spielberg sets the period spirit with a rock n roll-fueled drag race and with the characters entry into the legendary Hangar 51 intimations of an other-worldly presence. As the aging issue is tossed off with a joke or two the sixtysomething hero quickly proves that the passage of time will not be an inhibiting factor all these years later as Indy trades smart remarks with the formidable Soviet officer Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) before jumping into action the equal of any of the great setpieces the entire series has previously offered. In Spalko the film has a villain worthy not just of Indiana Jones but of a James Bond film one whos madly intelligent as well as appreciative of an opponent she views as a near-equal. With her trim gray uniform silver rapier Louise Brooks haircut and piercing blue eyes Blanchett provides a major treat whenever shes around. The 20 nonstop opening minutes include a striking variation on the many cookie-cutter middle-class housing tracts featured in Spielberg films this one populated exclusively by plastic figurines enacting a cliche of a 50s Yank lifestyle while awaiting the nuclear test to come one Indy must quickly figure out how to survive. Even thats not the end of the scene which runs the length of the sort of Saturday matinee adventure serial that inspired the series in the first place. Like the bravura opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan"" this smashing launch sets a standard the rest of the film has some trouble living up to. When Professor Jones returns to his university hes informed by his dean (Jim Broadbent replacing the late Denholm Elliott) that hes being suspended due to FBI doubt over his loyalty. Indiana Jones suspected of commie sympathies? And this after hes already told Spalko that ""I like Ike."" Another iconic aspect of the decade rolls in with a kid named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) a leather-jacketed biker who travels with comb and switchblade. Between a contrived fistfight and extended motorized chase around the leafy college campus Mutt sets the grand adventure in motion by offering evidence of the possible location of the Crystal Skull of Akator an object of great archeological and possibly psychic and other-dimensional fascination. In a nostalgia-producing air travel montage like those in previous series entries Indy and Mutt make their way to Peru where the action relaxes in some rather rote creepy-crawly cave shenanigans before the guys lay their hands on the crystal skull itself an oddly shaped clear cranium that all agree is not of human origin. But its shortly snatched by Spalko who believes the skull possesses psychic power that would prove decisive in mind warfare no doubt ending the Cold War then and there. All this gibberish is merely designed to justify the battle of wits and weapons which continues apace as the Russians collect two further prisoners Indys old cohort and crystal skull expert the now insane Professor Oxley (John Hurt) and Mutts mom none other than Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) Indys flame from ""Raiders"" and clearly the woman he was always meant to be with. Coming at pics midway point its a welcome reunion although written to escalate too quickly into intense bickering; a few more initial beats of mutual recognition to permit the resonance of their relationship to seep back into the characterizations would have give the rematch more heft. But its off and running again with a race through the jungle as the good guys and bad guys jump between vehicles duel with fists sabers and machine guns are assaulted by monkeys and ravenous giant ants and in an undoubted preview of a forthcoming theme-park ride plummet down three imposing waterfalls. For pure action thrills this sequence rates close to the first one yet theres one more to come a mixed-bag wrap-up that transports the Indiana Jones series into a realm its never occupied before but is well familiar to Spielberg and Lucas. For all the verbiage expended just to keep the story cranking forward David Koepps script accomplishes the two essentials It keeps the structure on the straight and narrow and is true to the character of Indiana Jones himself. Thanks to this and Fords full-bodied performance Indy comes through just as viewers remember him crafty capable impatient manly and red-blooded American. He looks great for his age although its never pretended hes younger than he is and Mutt pays him the ultimate compliment when he says ""For an old man you aint bad in a fight."" Allen also looks real good and radiates the same winning smile and tomboyish enthusiasm that made her ""Raiders"" characterization so critical to the films complete success; her Marion is perhaps the greatest Hawksian female performance in anything other than a Howard Hawks film. LaBeouf eventually earns his stripes after a somewhat forced beginning and Ray Winstone along with fellow Brits Hurt and Broadbent fills out the roster of newcomers as a duplicitous mercenary who switches sides with each change of fortune. Technically film is every bit as accomplished as one expects from Spielberg and the series. Of the directors key original collaborators editor Michael Kahn and composer John Williams return in full form. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas provides some striking creations particularly the ancient circular chamber that houses the climax. First three series were lensed by the great British d.p. Douglas Slocombe in bold clean images and while Spielbergs now-regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski has mostly succeeded in reproducing this look which is very different from his usual style he still cant prevent himself from letting in some characteristic flared light and hazy backgrounds.
