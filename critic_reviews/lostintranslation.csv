A reflection on the way alienating environments can throw unlikely people together and forge unexpected intense relationships this teasing seductive drama displays perceptiveness and maturity coaxing an evocative sense of the sweet agony of unarticulated sentiments. Adopting the same dreamily lyrical approach that distinguished her 1999 debut ""The Virgin Suicides"" Sofia Coppola generates an even further out-of-body feeling with ""Lost in Translation."" A reflection on the way alienating environments can throw unlikely people together and forge unexpected intense relationships this teasing seductive drama displays perceptiveness and maturity coaxing an evocative sense of the sweet agony of unarticulated sentiments. Largely a two-hander for Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson the films unhurried pace will target it for discerning audiences only but its wry humor and coolly amused observation of contemporary Japan should score with smart urbanites. While her previous pic was based on a novel ""Translation"" comes from Coppolas original screenplay which has a refreshingly loose quasi-improvised quality. Reportedly written with Murray in mind the film is superbly tailored to the actors signature brand of wit and deadpan delivery. Murrays nuanced unshowy turn here stands alongside his work in Wes Andersons ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" both of which were similar illustrations of a director deftly harnessing the comic thesps distinctive personality as well as his largely untapped capacity to convey pathos. The central relationship is explored from the contrasting perspectives of a woman in her early 20s and a middle-aged man each afflicted by different yet parallel doubts about the course their life respectively is taking or has taken. Bob Harris (Murray) is a movie star in Tokyo to shoot a lucrative whisky commercial. Charlotte (Johansson) is a Yale philosophy graduate in town with her celebrity photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi). While Bob endures the indignities of spouting inane ad dialogue and being steered through joyless promotional engagements he contemplates his faded career and stagnant marriage. Left behind at the hotel while work-driven John is off on assignment Charlotte reflects on how her husband has changed during two years of marriage and how her own life lacks direction. This situation of two people with too much time on their hands falling prey to nagging anxieties is rendered with elegant economy. Crossing paths repeatedly in the artificial environment of their luxury hotel Charlotte and Bob eventually speak in the cocktail bar their shared bemusement with the oddities of Japan helping to fuel a rapidly evolving friendship. Bob accompanies Charlotte to a karaoke night with a bunch of acquaintances and the two start hanging out watching late-night TV in the hotel and gradually revealing more about their personal backgrounds. In a nicely gauged scene that appears to acknowledge Coppolas own steps toward artistic self-expression prior to directing Charlotte confesses to being stuck having tried her hand at writing and photography without distinction and not knowing what to try next. Bob responds by dropping his armor of irony and talking to her about the less satisfying realities of marriage and having kids very gently revealing his attraction to her. While the relationship repeatedly appears poised to move to the next level Coppola judiciously holds it back introducing a degree of friction when Bob sleeps with a hotel lounge singer (Catherine Lambert). When it comes time for Bob to leave Tokyo the awkwardness of the goodbye is heightened by the weight of certain unexpressed feelings but this is satisfyingly resolved in a tender final exchange in which Bobs words to Charlotte remain unheard. Very much a mood piece the films deft balance of humor and poignancy makes it both a pleasurable and melancholy experience. Theres nothing labored or forced in the exploration of the undefined yet intense relationship and the insights about this type of brief but indelibly memorable bond emerge quite casually. An always appealing unaffected actress Johansson gives a smartly restrained performance as an observant questioning woman with a rich interior life perhaps a little too savvy for the man she married and aware she may face tough choices ahead. Ribisi keeps his character just on the right side of being a superficial L.A. celebrity-monde caricature. And Anna Faris contributes an amusing turn as a vacuous movie star gushing enthusiastically about the benefits of power cleansing. But the film is very much Murrays vehicle and its hard to imagine anyone else filling his shoes so well. The actor is equally amusing making the audience complicit as he gently mocks Japanese ceremoniousness or the communication warp of speaking through an interpreter or in more physical comedy such as a scene with a deluxe-kink hooker. And his karaoke rendition of Bryan Ferrys ""More Than This"" is sublime. In her second film Coppola consolidates the impression of her promising debut that shes a filmmaker confidently forging her own style quite distinct from and seemingly uninfluenced by that of her father. The directors love and fascination for Japan are evident in every frame from the neon-jungle aspect of Tokyos congested streets to the occasional departures into the calm of its gardens and temples. The free-flowing narrative style is enhanced by Lance Acords loose agile camerawork by Sarah Flacks smooth editing and by a melodic electronic score which like ""The Virgin Suicides"" is again overseen by Brian Reitzell and includes contributions from French ambient-pop duo Air.

Asked what she thought of Coppolas first film ""The Virgin Suicides"" the 18-year-old Johansson pauses. ""Um."" Another pause. ""Well its hard to do an adaptation of a book especially that one. I wasnt crazy about Virgin Suicides. I think Lost in Translation is a much more mature film for Sofia."" Finally an actress who saves her acting for the movies.Johanssons unvarnished answer makes sense shes always radiated a throaty gravity and projected a blunt honesty on screen. She was preternaturally wise as an 11-year-old in ""Manny amp; Lo""; poignant as the withdrawn badly injured girl in ""The Horse Whisperer"" (The Hoarse Whisperer could describe her distinctive voice) and memorably contemptuous as an outsider in ""Ghost World"" alongside Thora Birch. Though the native New Yorker has been performing since her off-Broadway debut at the age of 8 the camera never catches her Acting. She gives the impression of having arrived fully formed. She just is--like a noun that doesnt need an adjective.If youve missed Johansson so far its because shes never slummed in the typical roles ""You mean a girl with some social handicap who becomes a cheerleader and marries the prom king? The thing is I have no obligation to be in movies I dont want to be in. And playing somebody whos completely vapid is not interesting to me. After The Horse Whisperer came out there was this huge craze for snuff movies about kids killing each other. I thought Im in high school I dont need to support myself Im gonna wait until something better comes along."" Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Something did. In Coppolas ""Lost in Translation"" Johansson finally takes center stage and becomes an adult. Holding her own with Bill Murray at his most inspired she plays Charlotte a smart but lost young woman who has accompanied her hip photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) to Tokyo. When her workaholic husband leaves her behind for an out-of-town shoot shes a stranger adrift in an alien land. In the lounge of a coolly modern luxury hotel she crosses paths with another jet-lagged deracinated American the famous actor Bob Harris (Murray) whos come to Japan to shoot a whisky commercial for a cool 2 million. Their brief wondrous encounter is the soul of this subtle funny melancholy film.Theres a big age difference between Charlotte and Bob but both find themselves stuck in their lives at loose ends and drawn to each other for solace. Hes in mid-life crisis his marriage in a rut his career slipping. His ironic flippancy can barely conceal his embarrassment at finding him--self an overpaid hawker of hard liquor. Charlotte who studied philosophy at Yale doesnt know what to do with her life; shes beginning to feel like an appendage to her husbands career. Both discombobulated by a foreign culture they begin their sweet ambiguous dance. Is it a paternal relationship or an erotic one? Is this a love story or something just to the left of it? Part of what makes this movie so special is its delicate blurring of conventional boundaries.And Johansson is right about her director. With this film it becomes clear that Sofia Coppola is a filmmaker with eyes all her own. You could see her lyrical potential in the ambitious but diffuse ""Suicides"" based on Jeffrey Eugenidess deliberately centerless novel. Here working from her own original script her focus is unwavering her touch light but precise. The beauty of ""Lost in Translation"" is in its exquisitely captured details. Coppola is a warm meticulous observer with an intimate style thats the polar opposite of her famous father Francis Ford. Hes grand opera. This is chamber music.Fans of great Bill Murray moments meanwhile will count the filming of the whisky commercial among his classic comic scenes. His mortifying appearance on a Japanese talk show with ""Japans Johnny Carson"" runs a close second. But the laughs Murray gets always serve the character. This role--which Coppola wrote with him in mind--shows us aspects of the actor we havent seen before even in ""Rushmore"" moments when he emerges from his shell of irony emotionally naked. Hes never been better and part of the credit goes to Johansson. Theyre oddly but perfectly matched. Her directness opens him up pierces his solitude softens him. Their connection is what this small unforgettable movie is about a transient magical restorative meeting of souls.The chemistry between them had to ignite in filming as it does in the story on the spot. ""We didnt have time to work on it really"" Johansson says. ""We met and literally started filming the next day. But it wasnt really important to establish anything because the characters meet in Tokyo just like we did. They have their awkward moment and go from there. I remember the first time I met him I thought Wow thats Bill Murray. He looks like Bill Murray. He talks like Bill Murray. It is Bill Murray It was like meeting Cal Ripken or something.""For Johansson ""Lost in Translation""--and speaking of lost in translation Cal Ripken?--is the beginning of what looks to be a breakthrough year. Shes already winning raves at film festivals for her next ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" in which she plays Vermeers intoxicating maid--and muse. Her husky voice and no-nonsense style are well on their way to becoming indelible.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Directed and written by Sofia Coppola. (R. 105 minutes.) When Sofia Coppola directed her first feature ""The Virgin Suicides"" (1999) the results were so stylish and assured that few were willing to give her full credit. It must have been her father Francis Coppola people said or her husband Spike Jonze (""Adaptation"" ""Being John Malkovich"") who walked her through the mechanics of film direction and then supervised the post- production. Such are the obstacles when one is a) female b) the child of a world- famous filmmaker and c) worst of all still remembered for a misbegotten performance as Michael Corleones daughter in ""The Godfather Part III."" But with ""Lost in Translation"" her gorgeous second film Sofia Coppola forever retires her reputation as a lightweight feeding off the milk of nepotism. A delicate beautifully observed study of impossible romance ""Lost in Translation"" is one of the best films of 2003 -- and a thrilling promise of things to come from an indisputably gifted director. (The film has garnered four Oscar nominations best picture best director best actor and best original screenplay.) Inspired by a number of trips that Coppola took to Japan in the 90s ""Lost in Translation"" stars Bill Murray as Bob Harris a middle-aged movie star who goes to Tokyo to earn a quick 2 million on a whiskey commercial. Bored displaced and unable to sleep Bob takes to hanging out in the hotel bar -- the kind of place where a second-rate songstress does a slow-tempo ""Scarborough Fair"" for sloshed tourists. There he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) the bored wife of a self- absorbed photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) and finds a kindred soul and fellow insomniac. The relationship is teasing at first slow to blossom They share an ironic detachment and dry wit an appreciation for the absurdity of a tourist hotel that isolates and imprisons offering a perfumed island in the midst of Tokyos chaos. Nothing is overstated in ""Lost in Translation"" nothing imposed and as result the viewer finds a sense of slow discovery. Like many of the best female filmmakers Coppola has an eye for the quiet surprising details that build character and mood the way a moment of silence or the look on someones face is sustained the cut of a costume the magical framing of Tokyos neon canyons or the way an erotic dancer is framed by a discreet and amused camera. As a film lover one despairs of finding movies like this particularly from American directors. Like Wes Anderson (""The Royal Tenenbaums"" ""Rushmore"") Coppola has a wonderful sense of dramatic rhythms. The easy smooth contours that she gives to ""Lost"" have the power to envelop and enchant us to stir up thoughts and reflections that work in tandem with the film -- similar to the way our thoughts are engaged by a great novel or short story. Its a treasure to not be crushed or overwhelmed by an excess of noise and style and the aural palette of ""Lost in Translation"" is equally as important as its visual scheme. Apart from knowing when quiet is necessary Coppola has impeccable taste in music and stocks her soundtrack with moody pieces that recall Brian Eno. Gradually Murray and Johanssons characters find their attraction turning physical. Each is cautious and each knows without having to say it that theyre living in an artificial world with an artificial dynamic Thousands of miles from home freed from routine and scrutiny one does odd sometimes reckless things. A passion that grows in that kind of laboratory cant be expected to survive in the ordinary world. One of the benefits of Coppolas languid style is the opportunity it affords her actors to show their best. Murray who reportedly had free rein to ad-lib lines in his funnier moments has never been this touching. Burned out by the pressures of celebrity fatigued by his advancing years Bob is hanging on to a disintegrating marriage when he meets the 30-years-younger Charlotte. Hes a sad-eyed and desperate man but Murray a vastly underrated dramatic actor fleshes him out so completely that Bob becomes doleful and adorable at the same time. It makes perfect sense that Charlotte with her acute monitor for pretense should magnetize to this sweet shell-shocked man -- to find that sense of peace that arrives when bonds are implicit and nothing needs to be explained. Johansson so impressive in ""Manny and Lo"" and ""Ghost World"" is in some ways Murrays mirror in other ways his opposite. While Murray suggests a man whos crumbling inside and out -- and yet retaining a childlike goofiness -- Johansson endows Charlotte with a skepticism and world-weariness that seem at odds with her youthful radiance. Coppola directs their scenes with the lightest of hands and gives us a film so poignant so funny so free of self-satisfied bravado that one cant help but look forward to her next work. -- Advisory This movie contains raw language and sexual situations.

"Lost in Translation Bonds Without Borders washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Lost in Translation Bonds Without Borders Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 12 2003 Under its title ""Lost in Translation"" begins by displaying an image that is itself lost in translation a beautiful womans rear end in repose lightly sheathed in gossamer knickers. Hoo boy you think (if youre emotionally about 17) is that ever in the Esperanto of sexual possibility. But that very image is misunderstood. Scarlett Johanssons lyrical caboose decodes not as sex but as something related yet utterly distinct intimacy. For if you see a woman in her skivvies that doesnt always mean sex is about to happen. (If youre married it means sex is probably not about to happen.) But it does signify that between the two of you theres a feeling of trust of togetherness of wholeness against a world full of idiots and morons and schemers. And thats exactly the subject of ""Lost in Translation."" Directed with grace and dexterity (but no great need to be done in a hurry) by Sofia Coppola its the story of an unlikely alliance between an aging movie star and the young wife of a photographer when the two find themselves abandoned in a Tokyo hotel for a few days while other people all around them do seemingly necessary and important things. Although the basis of their confederation is their mutual conviction that these necessary and important things are pretty much bull-flop. Bill Murray in his most complete performance since ""Groundhog Day"" plays Bob Harris the star a lion in . . . if not winter possibly edging toward autumn. Bobs fatigue shows in his tone his body language. Murray reminds me of Jerry Lewiss great performance in Martin Scorseses ""King of Comedy"" in that it seems as if gravity has singled him out for special punishment pulling his flesh down closer and closer to the earth. His Bob is in Japan to shoot a sublimely ridiculous whiskey commercial for a sublimely ridiculous fee. (Its a poorly kept secret that many stars like Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have shown the yen for easy yen.) Two million bucks to look sophisticated and say ""Suntory Whiskey -- its smooth and relaxing"" or something like that. Bob is a pro and he soldiers on even if dealing in Japan with the Japanese is a bafflement wrapped inside an enigma inserted into a sushi maki. In the same hotel -- the Park Hyatt Tokyo -- Coppola gets a great sense of place from this noplace 211 caverns and halls and streamlined Japanese rooms without character or tone -- stays Charlotte with the loose dull face of the utterly disengaged. Charlottes husband John who photographs rock musicians is played at full-tilt narcissistic abandon by Giovanni Ribisi. In fact all of Coppolas pocket portraits of entertainment figures -- agents publicists photographers and particularly a grotesque young American actress -- are dead-on and hilarious. Shes got the satirists gift for killing swiftly without a lot of blood and screaming. But Charlotte isnt hilarious and its another vivid example of Coppolas gift how quickly the young director evokes the dynamic of a marriage gone stale. Charlotte is a smart beautiful Yalie and she was obviously taken with Johns glamour. But hes the kind of person who in getting it doesnt get it. Hes too career-obsessed to notice how trivial his career is. And he has begun to dislike the fact that she sees through his shallowness and the dreariness of his friends and that she cant focus on his passionate discussions of his interpretations of the looks of various artists he photographs. Its not stated but clearly the issue in play is Can this marriage be saved? Probably not. So it is that John disappears for a bit and Charlotte and Bob meet in the hotels swanky bar and immediately begin to hit it off in subtle secret ways. Clearly they are agreed on the fatuousness of much of the world and the infantility of the rest of it. And they both hate someone passionately themselves. What unspools is essentially two separate movies one very funny in a Bill Murray kind of way the other very poignant in a Sofia Coppola kind of way. The technical difficulty is that each movie requires a different Bill Murray and try as I might I can come up with no coherent theory of Bob Harriss psychology. One movie chronicles the adventures of an American movie star with a career in deep hemorrhage trying to get through a financially necessary ordeal in Japan. Murray certainly doesnt overdo it but with that prehensile face and its weird ability to project not just broad-stroke attitudes like ""irony"" but substates like ""58 percent irony/40 percent fatigue/2 percent responsibility"" hes very funny. Coppola keeps throwing up things for him to react to a masseuse who may be a prostitute lying on her back on the floor riding an imaginary bicycle and screaming incomprehensibly in Japanese while he just sits there that magnificent instrument of a face generating various shades of sub- and sub-substate; or his inability to stay focused during a commercial shoot that is utterly chaotic because his translator speaks worse English than he speaks Japanese -- and he speaks no Japanese. The other movie is about a lonely sad older man who seems as completely un-movie-star as you could imagine (he seems more like a CEO) who meets an equally lonely sad younger woman in a hotel and finds her magically simpatico. You know the sensation Its not love but its some immediate awareness that the two of you may have been separated at birth your minds operate alike your synapses fire in the same pattern you recognize the same enemies (many) and the same allies (few). Its you and she against the world and boy is it ever fun. Sex somehow doesnt come into it. Sex somehow would ruin it. You can get sex anywhere. (And Bob does.) From this one you want that precious process that E.M. Forster so wisely described as ""only connect."" So Bob and Charlotte connect and proceed through a number of adventures in Japan and discover that their equal bafflement at all things Japanese is somehow a part of their bond. Thats really the magic of the movie which is in the end wonderfully nice. It gets at something exquisitely human so human that even movie stars feel it. Lost in Translation (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for language and sexual suggestiveness.

"Bill Murray opens up in Lost in Translation. Slate Sign In Sign Up Bill Murray opens up in Lost in Translation. Bill Murray opens up in Lost in Translation. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 11 2003 634 PM Prisoner of Japan Bill Murray opens up in Lost in Translation. By David Edelstein Murray and Johansson hilariously detatched in Tokyo Watching Bill Murray in Sofia Coppolas Lost in Translation (Focus Features) I felt as if I were seeing his face for the first time. Weve all seen his comic mask the rumpled but unruffle-able ironist mock-suave holding himself in quotation marks. Murrays comic style is based on not opening himself up emotionally Its the hipster-clowns triumph over vulnerability. The problem for him as a ""straight"" actor is how to stay true to that side of his personality (which is his genius) and yet somehow bare his soul as a real actor must. Murray has given serious performances to groans in The Razors Edge (1984) and huzzahs in Rushmore (1998). But it seems to me that his two halves have never come together as they do here in a way that connects that hilarious detachment with the deep and abiding sense of isolation that must have spawned it. This is the Bill Murray performance weve been waiting for Saturday Night Live meets Chekhov. Advertisement Coppolas film isnt Chekhov but its an entrancing mood piece an improbably romantic (and funny) evocation of emotional isolation. Scarlett Johansson (she was Thora Birchs blase sidekick in Ghost World [2001]) plays the directors alter ego Charlotte a 25-year-old ex-philosophy major visiting Japan with her showbiz photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) a jabbering whirlwind who barely makes eye contact. In their cool ultramodern Tokyo hotel which feels like a space station Charlotte wanders the corridors or sits on the windowsill of her room hugging her bare knees and staring at the city from afar. She cant sleep at night Her loneliness is too oppressive. So she heads for the panoramic sky bar with its redheaded Caucasian singer who melodramatically draws out the finale of ""Scarborough Fair"" ""Parsley sage rosemary and THYYYMMME ... "" Its there that she encounters Bob Harris (Murray) a fading American movie star making 2 million for a series of commercials for a Japanese whiskey Suntory. Earlier in the film Bob arrives depressed and jet-lagged into a neon-swamped Tokyo and stares out of his limo at his image on a building-sized Suntory ad. He blinks and shakes his head as if to pull his mind back into his body The sense of being outside himself is total. Unable to sleep (the fax machine hums with businesslike missives from his wife in the midst of renovating their house) Bob stations himself in the bar and drinks to detach himself even more conclusively. Far removed from the city the culture and the language Bob and Charlotte feel their lack of connection more fiercely than they do on their home turf Theyre in solitary confinement in their own heads. Slowly (very slowly actually; the film has its longueurs) the middle-aged man with no center and the young woman who doesnt know who shes supposed to be recognize their pain in each others eyes and develop a joshing intimacy. I wont say if the relationship is physically consummated. But the richness of the movie I think is in the way that question is handled--in how they struggle to honor the bridge theyve built between them while articulating nothing. The meaning is buried in the inconsequential jokes the eye (and foot) contact and in the way that Coppola frames them together and apart. She does have quite an eye. The directors Tokyo (and that of her cinematographer Lance Accord) is all pockets of glowing neon light in the darkness. The movie has few tight close-ups Its all about the characters uncertain relationship to the space. Only the movies first shot is a head-scratcher a rear view of Johansson on a hotel bed with her butt crack visible through sheer pink panties as she stares through the window at the high-rises of Tokyo. The meaning of this image is less transparent than Johanssons attire but my guess is that Coppola wants us to see the whole film as the vaguely erotic dream of an alienated young woman. She wants to make this womans detachment from this culture and from her own body hypnotically sexy and to put the longing for human connection into your bloodstream from the first frame. But I was mostly thinking about her butt crack. Coppola might have lost us without Murrays incessant and hilarious riffing--with the Japanese who bewilder him and with Charlotte whom he understands almost too well. The scenes in which Bob shoots his Suntory commercials for his histrionic Japanese director--dutifully at the mans vague suggestion impersonating each member of the Rat Pack in turn including Joey Bishop--are comedy classics on par with his best work on Saturday Night Live. And he achieves a blissfully funny rapport with a homuncular little woman--a sort of Japanese Linda Hunt with stuck-out ears--who insists on talking to him in Japanese in a hospital waiting room. When Charlotte emerges from the doctors office Murray is holding a stuffed-animal owl; and for an instant I wondered if as in the great Japanese anime Spirited Away (2002) the old woman had suddenly metamorphosed into a precious gift for the young girl. Almost everything to do with Bob and Charlotte is marvelous--and Johansson holds the camera nearly as well as Murray her face so baby-smooth yet uncannily self-possessed. But the other characters are ciphers. Ribisis John hardly registers and Im not sure how were supposed to take Charlottes utter lack of interest in her husbands work. (If I were Coppolas husband the director Spike Jonze Id be worried.) And Coppola is too smug in her condescension toward the Tara Reid-like starlet (Anna Faris) who fawns all over John. Theres something narcissistic and entitled about her two protagonists that isnt a great advertisement for Americans Abroad. Charlotte asks Bob why the Japanese mix up their ls and rs and he says ""for yucks""--which is very funny in a Bill Murray-esque way. But theyre our yucks at their expense. Its bad enough to make fun of Japanese for their English in English-speaking countries. But in Japan? The sense of otherness and of cultural superiority merges uncomfortably. Lost in Translation would cut even deeper if Coppola had found a way to dramatize how Bobs and Charlottes sense of superiority contributes to their loneliness making them more alienated than theyd otherwise be. But Coppola is young and finding her voice. Her own alienation is so gorgeous and so transfixing you cant help forgiving her for wanting to wallow in it for a time.

But the joys of Sofia Coppolas Lost in Translation come from watching Murray modify his trademark passive-aggressive style into played-straight comic bewilderment -- and to marvel at his slim new picture-of-health appearance. (Related item Coppolas wake-up call) Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star in Lost in Translation. For a full hour and 45 minutes were tickled into a perpetual grin watching Murrays almost passive reaction to the passing parade in a movie that gives him more comic business than previously muted turns in Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums. Consistent with this after her provocative debut with The Virgin Suicides Coppolas second feature offers quiet humor in lieu of the bludgeoning direct assaults most comedies these days inflict. Cast opposite a most simpatico co-star (Scarlett Johansson 34 years younger) Murray plays a fading movie star. In Tokyo to shoot a big-bucks booze commercial hes as flummoxed by the place as most parents are by those bizarre cartoon shorts that precede Pokemon features. The citys crazy-quilt geography nonplusses him as does a kinky prostitute who shows up unexpectedly in his room with rehearsed moans and the Japanese filmmaker who mangles the pronunciation of ""Rat Pack"" when trying to direct Murray into a just-right whiskey-smooth mood. More about the movie Lost in Translation    1/2 Stars Bill Murray Scarlett Johansson Giovanni Ribisi Anna Faris Director Sofia Coppola Distributor Focus Features Rating R for sexual content Opens today in New York L.A. Boston Chicago Seattle San Francisco and Washington Meanwhile Johansson is being forced to stand by (or more precisely sit at the hotel bar) as her celebrity-photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) sucks up to his clientele. Disheartened shes far less solicitous of celeb Murray but chummy enough for them to hit it off incrementally in karaoke bars neon-drenched streets and other unthreatening venues (even on a bed they keep it cool). Hes been around so he knows she is something special. She hasnt been around so hes a double revelation. Romantic comedies with two low-key leads can be asking for trouble but one senses that the actors must have clicked on some fundamental level. Murray and Johansson even better than she was in Ghost World seem so natural together that you have to pinch yourself to reflect on their age difference. Whats more the movies narrative is so focused and restrained in its sexuality that you dont think too much about the Murray spouse saddled with pampered kids back home. This movie isnt anything like Suicides nor for that matter anything that comes to mind from the filmography of Sofias papa Francis. Maybe the senior Coppola offered free advice or maybe not but a two-for-two tally probably doesnt lie. This is a career worth watching and a movie worth watching too.

His name is Bob Harris and he is an American movie star come to Japan -- as American movie stars often do -- to appear in a television commercial of the sort that he would never venture near on his home turf. Somewhere this man has a wife and a life both of them carrying on quite nicely it would appear without him. She sends carpet samples from a household renovation project via FedEx to his hotel. When he calls home it is to be reminded that he has forgotten his sons birthday (and judging from the sound of it not for the first time). Of course he could be there; he could be doing a play for scale instead of collecting a cool 2 million for endorsing a Suntory bourbon hes probably never even tasted. But he is not there. He is here. And he is lost. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The woman Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is also lost. Barely into her 20s she stares up quizzically at the SoHo photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) who is supposed to be her husband as he darts frantically about their suite gathering up his equipment for a shoot. Can it be that this is the man that she married? Can it be that she is already married at all at such a tender age with so much of the world left to see and so many things yet to do? Can it be that this is really Tokyo she is staring out at from the windows of the Park Hyatt Tokyo when by day and from on high it resembles almost any other major metropolitan city? Later when she attempts to convey her confusion to a friend back in America she will fail miserably. Besides on the other end of the line the friend is managing her own tumultuous existence and despite her efforts to lend a sympathetic ear is easily distracted. Though the year is 2003 and the world is in so many ways at its smallest with cell phones and e-mail binding us inextricably to one another we are this extraordinary new movie reminds us ever more diffused ever less able to make meaningful connections. The movie is writer-director Sofia Coppolas Lost in Translation and it is the story of what happens when Bob and Charlotte cross paths by chance in the same hotel bar where a cover band is eternally cranking out so-bad-theyre-almost-good cover versions of such apropos standards as ""The Thrill Is Gone."" In truth theyve spotted each other before in the elevator exchanged a smile even. But this is one of those hotels where familiar-looking strangers are forever sighting each other amid that strange displacement of time and place that big modern hotels can create. And surely Bob Harris is no stranger to recognition. Even here in this faraway locale he cannot so much as drown his sorrows without being accosted by fans who loved him in this movie or that. Even here he cannot turn on the television in his room without seeing a younger version of himself -- or turn it off without seeing his present self reflected in its darkened screen. Except that Charlotte does not know any of Bobs movies; she recognizes in him not fame but something deeper a kind of shared disillusionment with everything life was supposed to turn out to be but didnt. ""Youre probably just having a midlife crisis"" she tells him in a flirtatiously offhand way realizing -- even before he does -- that they are two people meeting each other at the same metaphysical point on lifes escalator albeit moving in opposite directions. He tells her with every curious twitch of his eyebrows and blink of his eyes just how long it has been since he related to another human being this openly and honestly (his wife included). After a long time wondering whether or not there is in the immortal words of Bryan Ferry ""more than this"" a question that many have never asked themselves even at Bobs age Bob and Charlotte find in each other a momentary answer. Like the love-struck train passengers of Before Sunrise or the man and woman who find each other in the traffic jam of Claire Denis recent Friday Night they are also aware that such moments are as fleeting as they are blindsiding -- that soon they will return to the lives they led before they ever met. (In their penultimate moment together she will ask him to stay in Japan jokingly suggesting that they start a punk band together. Would that it were so easy.) So they know they must make the most of the weekend they have together while Charlottes husband is off photographing a band on some distant Japanese island. And here unexpectedly is a movie in which making the most of a friendship does not automatically equate to sexual consummation. Rather Bob and Charlotte bask in the random pleasure of each others company setting off in Lost in Translations most extraordinary sequence on a midnight odyssey through Tokyos bars and karaoke parlors -- a sequence in which Tokyo comes to life onscreen in a way that it never quite has in a movie and in which the scenes and the performances seem to be developing spontaneously right before our eyes.

Aug. 15 705pm Premium Seating Los Angeles Angels v SEATTLE MARINERS Tickets Mon. Aug. 15 705pm This is the second feature film written and directed by Sofia Coppola -- who is just 32 years old -- and like her first (2000s The Virgin Suicides) it possesses a maturity and wisdom well beyond her years. All the more remarkable is that Lost in Translation is an original screenplay (whereas The Virgin Suicides had Jeffrey Eugenides fine novel as a source) informed by Coppolas own time spent in Japan when she was even younger than she is now. Perhaps because of that experience of living amid a foreign culture at a particularly impressionable moment Coppola (in superb collaboration with cinematographer Lance Acord who has also shot the films of Coppolas husband Spike Jonze) sees Japan not as some exotic Hollywood backdrop but as an ever-shifting organic mass of salient details unfamiliar to the Western eye. On a subtextual level of course Tokyo is for Coppola what England was for E.M. Forster or what Italy was for Antonioni an expanse of disconnect. But in the resplendent naturally lit images of Lost in Translation the city becomes a rainbow- colored maze of too-small bathrooms psychedelic TV talk shows and video-game arcades where the games are played with drumsticks instead of joysticks. And in the telling Coppolas sophomore effort becomes one of the greatest most sensual films I can recall on the subject of strangers navigating their way through a strange land. Lost in Translation is fraught with a deep sadness and sense of yearning. Yet it is also an enormously -- at times even uproariously -- comedic film not because it feels any obligation to be ""funny"" in some contrived screenwriterly sort of way but because Coppola has set out to make a movie set to the rhythms of real (rather than reel) life in which there are no genres. She has cast an ostensible funnyman Bill Murray in a role some might consider (even after Rushmore) to be a stretch and he has responded with a performance of emotional nakedness and humility fully aware that this part (not unlike Bobs brief encounter with Charlotte) isnt just the best hes ever had but better than most actors ever get. Then there is Johansson closer in age (18) to Coppola herself and capturing in her own weary wistfulness the simultaneous fear of new untapped experience and the desire for same that are the key forces motivating this entire film. Coppolas point being that you dont necessarily have to be middle-aged to feel a kind of middle-aged craziness to look out at the great void of all that is yet to come and shudder a bit with both trepidation and the urge to leap. Maybe those of us who do just that she seems to be saying are in fact the lucky -- if not necessarily the happy -- few.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lost-in-translation ) Lost in Translation (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Simply put Sofia Coppolas Lost in Translation is an amazing motion picture. There may be some controversy over whether she truly wrote the screenplay on her own (there are sequences that argue that she at least had help from someone with a little more experience in life and marriage) but that doesnt impact the final analysis. This study into the unfathomable depths of human relationships has more honesty than 95% of the movies I have seen this year. Beautifully photographed with some amazing shots of nighttime Tokyo (and I thought Times Square was garish) and a gorgeously composed scene of two characters reflected in a plate glass window as they hold a conversation this movie has a look to match its acting and content. The film details the ""accidental"" relationship that develops between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Bob an internationally recognized actor on the downside of his career is in Tokyo filming a series of ads for a whiskey company. Charlotte a recent Yale graduate is accompanying her photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi) on a business trip. However she spends most of the time alone. Bob and Charlottes first few encounters are casual - on an elevator in a bar. Gradually however they begin to seek out one another and a bond develops. The two eventually spend nearly every waking hour together holding deep conversations and finding ways to avoid the eventual parting that both know must occur. Lost in Translation is smart and perceptive about how people interact on a personal level. It portrays the disorientation of the two main characters flawlessly. They are two normal individuals who might not offer each other more than a smile under ordinary circumstances but put together in a place where they dont understand the language or customs and have no one else to turn to their attachment is potent. In a strange sort of way Lost in Translation reminded me of Lina Wertmullers Swept Away where two characters discover that the intensity of their relationship is predicated upon their circumstances. Take them off the island where they are marooned and it all evaporates. The situation is similar here. The closeness shared by Bob and Charlotte is likely not something that would survive in ""the real world."" Will it get a chance? The screenplay cleverly leaves the decision up to the viewer. The rich dialogue sparkles and spans a variety of topics. The characters discuss issues both deep and shallow - from the search for the soul and the meaning of life to how couples communicate after long years of marriage. Theres plenty of room for non-intrusive low-key comedy such as the blinds that automatically open in the morning to let in the light or the showerhead that is too low for Bob. Then theres the call girl who invades Bobs room and demands that he ""lip"" her stockings. (She actually means ""rip."") The relationship between Bob and Charlotte remains at the films core and remains platonic despite strong sexual undercurrents. A deep bond of friendship takes root which leads to something more sublime than what we normally see between male and female characters in movies. The romantic tension starts out subtle but builds until every frame throbs with it. There never really is a release but the last perfectly-pitched scene alleviates some of the pent-up pressure. The lead performances cry ""Oscar"" (Whether nominations will follow remains to be seen. Who knows with the Academy?) This is unquestionably the best performance ever given by Bill Murray. The word ""perfect"" is rarely used in association with the work of an actor but it is deserved here. Murray is mainly serious but he gets the opportunity to throw in little bits of comedy (improvised by him?) that are understated enough that they dont damage the flow. Best of all as a man in the midst of a mid-life crisis Murray never seems to force anything. This is a far cry from The Razors Edge. Matching Murray beat-for-beat is the luminous Scarlett Johansson whose work here should catapult her into the elite circle of young female actresses (alongside Natalie Portman Kirsten Dunst and Reese Witherspoon to name a few). Johansson has been wonderful in a handful of other movies (Manny amp; Lo The Horse Whisperer Ghost World) but never has her work resonated the way it does here. And what Murray and Johansson display goes far beyond what is conventionally referred to as ""screen chemisty."" If you get the sense that I applaud this movie you are correct. Lost in Translation requires a certain amount of patience but it is by no means a slow or lugubrious endeavor. Director Coppola has done what any young director wants to accomplish improve upon a successful first feature. As good as The Virgin Suicides is Lost in Translation is superior in almost every way. When Top 10 lists are released at the end of the year this title will feature prominently on a number of them (including mine).

But much of whats astonishing about Sofia Coppolas enthralling new movie is the precision maturity and originality with which the confident young writer-director communicates so clearly in a cinematic language all her own conveying how it feels to find oneself temporarily unmoored from familiar surroundings and relationships. This is a movie about how bewilderingly profoundly alive a traveler can feel far from home. Its a movie that anchors Coppola (""The Virgin Suicides"") as an original artist. Its also a movie that inspires Bill Murrays greatest work yet. And coming from this devotee of ""Rushmore"" ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Caddyshack"" thats saying a lot. Mainstream-junk American movie star Bob Harris (Murray) meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) the young wife of a hepped-up celebrity photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) in the elaborately luxurious Park Hyatt Hotel in Tokyo. Bob stuck in a stagnant long-term marriage back home is in Japan to make a quick big paycheck by shooting a Japanese whiskey commercial; Charlotte depressed in a new marriage to someone she already senses is wrong for her is left to decorate the hotel room while her groovy climber husband hustles and flirts with fame and girls. (Anna Faris from the ""Scary Movie"" factory nails it as a tin-pot Hollywood starlet in town.) Sleepless in a society of elaborate courtesies and a city of dizzying sensory stimulation Bob and Charlotte jetlagged and wired bump up against each other in hallways and lounges. They make a connection. And for a while the middle-aged man unnerved by sadness and the young woman paralyzed by possibility venture out together to explore the lunar exoticism of a visitors Japan - temporarily intimately found not lost in each others company. Melancholy and longing have rarely looked so attractive - even desirable - nor has a movie with opportunities for ""Lolita""-hood been turned into so subtle wise and often funny a study of chance encounter. Coppola has an eye for this stuff - she gets exactly whats crazy-appealing about the cocooned freedom of karaoke bars or about the ridiculousness of striking movie-star poses to hawk booze. (Shes also got a sensibility that attracts simpatico production talent including the exciting ""Adaptation"" cinematographer Lance Acord who shoots a photographic love letter to Tokyo.) Most crucial of all Coppola had the determination and good taste to pursue Murray until her famously hard-to-pin-down choice for leading man said yes to the role that is perhaps to his surprise the most vulnerable and unmannered he has ever felt comfortable enough to be. Murray handles both absurdity and sincerity lightly - in some scenes he improvises on a hot streak any comedian would kill to ride. But working opposite the embracing restful serenity of Johansson Murray reveals something more commanding in his repose than we have ever seen before. Trimmed to a newly muscular rangy handsomeness and in complete rapport with his characters hard-earned acceptance of lifes limitations Murray turns in a great performance that once again gets admirers hoping for an Oscar nomination. Maybe this time the credit due wont get lost in translation.
