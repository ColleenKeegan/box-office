By Anthony Lane Annette Bening Meg Ryan and Eva Mendes in a remake of George Cukors movie.   Credit LARA TOMLIN The funniest thing about ""The Women"" is that Mick Jagger is one of the producers. There was a knowing laugh in the theatre as his name sprang up in the opening credits--our last chance to laugh as it turned out for the next two hours. The movie written and directed by Diane English is a rehash (or more simply a hash) of the George Cukor picture of 1939 which was written by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin who adapted it from Clare Boothe Luces play. The old film was famous for featuring no men whatsoever and the latest version maintains the trick. Everybody is female fellow-diners New York passersby and merciless hailers of cabs. Only in the closing scene is a person of the opposite sex allowed to emerge and its not Mick Jagger. He was probably lolling backstage away from the action licking his lips. Meg Ryan plays Mary Haines wife of the invisible Stephen Haines and mother of preteen Molly (India Ennenga). Marys best friends are Sylvie Fowler (Annette Bening) a magazine editor who fears for her job and Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) who has three little girls and another child on the way. You can already hear the squeaks and grinds as the various figures are shunted into position; this is one of those movies in which human beings instead of being drawn as living souls are defined purely by the social or professional attitudes they happen to represent. Most grimly walled in is Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett Smith) who stands for blocked bestselling African-American lesbian essayists everywhere. Via the loose mouth of a manicurist Sylvie--followed by Mary herself--learns that Stephen is having an affair with a perfume saleswoman named Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes). In 1939 Crystal was played by Joan Crawford whom another character described as a ""pretty girl"" which is like referring to the M4 Sherman as a nice little runabout. Not only would you write your last will and testament before going to bed with her; one look at those burning eyes and youd think twice before asking her for an atomizer. Mendes makes a more credible vamp and Crystal gets one short speech during a contretemps with Mary that puts the whole film into perspective. The two of them meet while trying on lingerie--Crystal to keep her man on the boil Mary to coax him back. (In any film about solidarity lingerie is the shorthand for emergency sluthood.) ""You have your fancy gardens and your nice houses"" Crystal says and proceeds to chip away at Marys fantasy of marital bliss. Mary who says that she was hoping for a ""transcendental moment of connect"" whatever that might be is floored by the insult but Crystals right. The women in ""The Women"" can afford to treasure their feelings and fuss over their heartbreaks. Theyre rich. Strange to say Cukors version is scarcely more seductive. Unlike his other dramas of fine living such as ""Dinner at Eight"" (1933) or ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940) it leaves you in a bad mood resentful of its characters. Depression audiences lofted from their cares by the son et lumiere of Katharine Hepburn flaring up at Cary Grant may well have felt their noses being rubbed in it by the twitterings of Rosalind Russell and Norma Shearer in ""The Women"" and so it is with their modern counterparts. ""What do you think this is some kind of nineteen-thirties movie?"" Mary asks her mother Catherine (Candice Bergen) and the answer is No this is some kind of nineteen-eighties movie. The women have no menfolk on show but they have nannies housekeepers gleaming automobiles and spreading lawns on which they host luncheon parties for their pals half of whom treat them like enemies. Their interests are pared to a safe minimum fashion magazines and fashion magazines. Nobody sweats for a living or hungers for one. When Mary separates from Stephen and hits a low she revives herself by taking photographs (cue a closeup of a seven-thousand-dollar Leica) and coloring in sketches of dresses. ""I want to design my own collection"" she admits to her mother who offers to finance it with her own inheritance as yet unused and unrequired. Isnt life grand? Only one thing in ""The Women"" escapes the spit of cattiness and that is not a human being but a store. According to Sylvie ""Nobody. Hates. Saks."" Such is the moral of this film run a close second by ""Dont give a shit about anybody--be selfish"" as delivered by Leah (Bette Midler) a trumpet-voiced movie agent. In short we are back in the land of ""Sex and the City"" and thus with the lurking suggestion that greed--emotional greed not just the material ravenings of the shopper--is the only alternative to the humiliation that comes from subservience to men. No middle way is permitted. Compare this with the split-and-try-again comedies of Hollywoods heyday like ""The Awful Truth"" or ""The Lady Eve"" and you cant help recalling the satisfaction of watching the heroine come out on top not because she had mooched around reflecting on her self-worth or invested that self in handbags but because she had fought like blazes to get there. Real women like Barbara Stanwyck Irene Dunne and Katharine Hepburn scrapped for their power against a society that had no wish to give it up or against hapless dithery males who had no clue what to do with it whereas ""The Women"" of 2008 gives empowerment a bad name. As in ""Sex and the City"" Candice Bergen is the only person here who cracks wise to any effect; everybody else flounders in a mire of soggy lines. A sample ""What do you think she sells Chanel Number Shit?""; ""Your Pradas are ruining my perennials""; ""This place makes Betty Ford look like Disneyland."" Laugh? I nearly slept. The wordplay is matched by the fatigue that pervades both the musical and the visual vocabularies in the opening credits an over-the-river travelling shot of the Manhattan skyline gives way to a closeup of heels and toned calves hymned by a voice singing ""Im Feeling Beautiful."" At the other end of the story I just about clung on consoled by the thought that whatever else Diane English had at least found the decency not to stoop to a birthing scene. Then it was time for the birthing scene. I am aware of the dire paucity of films that appeal to a grownup female audience as opposed to a mob of ten-year-old ""Transformers"" fans but why should discerning viewers of either gender be fobbed off with indolence? Taken together ""Sex and the City"" ""Mamma Mia"" and ""The Women"" add up to a spectacular trilogy of the inane and to point that out is not the prerogative of the misogynist or the killjoy. Its the view of someone who thinks that women deserve better from the movies and who sees no joys to kill. It comes as a shock to realize that in three months time Samuel L. Jackson will turn sixty. We cant think of him growing old just as we cant really imagine that he was ever young. He seemed to arrive on our screens full grown ripe in mind and muscle richly amused and already in possession of his gifts. I love those line readings of his best heard in ""Pulp Fiction""--the diction clear and clipped but the tone swinging up into inquiry at the end of a phrase as if other peoples assumptions were there to be probed. Those jabs come to the fore in Neil LaButes new movie ""Lakeview Terrace."" Jackson plays a seasoned Los Angeles cop with the workmanlike name of Abel Turner--a widower who runs a tight ship to the chagrin of his young son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) and his teen-age daughter Celia (a terrific performance from Regine Nehy). One day new neighbors arrive a white guy named Chris Mattson (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Lisa (Kerry Washington) who happens to be black. From the word go Abel doesnt like them for some reason and one of the strengths of LaButes film is that for a long while we cant work out what that reason might be. It is mainly but not wholly an aversion to mixed-race marriage; Abel is offended by something else in Chris and Lisa--their liberality and hope or their ignorance of the fractious patch of South Central that he patrols. Generations matter too and this is where Jacksons age counts in uniform he looks beefy and buff but out in his yard slopping about in shorts and sandals he seems to sag. The movie was written by David Loughery and Howard Korder not by LaBute himself though it sounds a lot like him in the lethal simmer of its conversation. (Brace yourself for Abel at the Mattsons housewarming party.) So much is at stake here Chris and Lisas house overlooks a vale of undeveloped land on the uneasy frontier of town and country and there is a wider sense of an urban culture uncertain where to head next. Its a shame then that the later stages of ""Lakeview Terrace"" should overheat and spill into silliness. The plot is compromised not resolved by the pulling of a gun. It was enough that Abel carried one with him at all times. Likewise the barroom scene where he ""explains"" the source of his wrath tends to drain it of threat and as for the forest fires that rage toward the characters quiet road thanks a lot but I think we get the point about racial inflammation. The first hour of the film however with Jackson in command feels dangerous necessary and rife with comic disturbance. Just like the man himself.

It nevertheless became a huge hit despite the fact that there has never been any reason to question his judgment -- not when the 1939 movie version came along and certainly not now as we cringingly confront writer-director Diane Englishs completely miscalculated remake. This ""property"" (one wouldnt want to dignify it with any grander term) comes complete with a gimmick No man -- not even among the extras -- is ever seen or heard in it. The playwrights original text can be described as a hard-working womans revenge on New Yorks idle rich wasting their days on manicures fashion shows and above all gossip. In updating the original English -- who was responsible for the estimable TV series Murphy Brown -- has been fairly faithful to her source. Once again the husband of Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) begins an affair with Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes) a perfume salesperson at Saks Fifth Avenue which launches an arch and endless chatter that naturally makes a bad situation worse. A divorce ensues and it requires what seems like 15 hours of screen time before a happy ending is achieved. English has jettisoned some old-fashioned stuff like the passage where Mary goes to Reno for her ""quickie"" divorce (there was in those days a six-week residency requirement). More important she has given most of The Womens women jobs (notably Annette Benings Sylvie a hard-pressed magazine editor). She seems to want to convert her version of the play into a tract for our times; you know something about the difficulties of having a family and a career simultaneously. But that does not address the pieces fundamental problem namely that it is not now and never has been funny. Or even human. In the previous movie version as in this one (and Ill bet in the play itself) all the actresses strike comedic poses. They sashay about rolling their eyes pouting their lips making big gestures and talking really fast. Its essentially an antique theatrical manner the falsity of which the movie camera dialing in for its close-ups (and even its two shots) exposes as relentlessly now as it did 69 years ago. No one ever gets to act -- and this is a cast rich in good actresses -- if by acting you mean the expression of authentic emotions. They are caught up in a zip-zap frenzy of words -- and it is interesting how many lines in this script can be traced back to the Boothe original which would not have been all that difficult to improve upon. There are other problems too. You can enjoy fast-track dialogue in television shows like Murphy Brown because a well-written sitcom requires only 22 minutes of your time not enough to make you weary of the rattling pace. But a movie running a couple of hours requires more breathing room -- time to savor characters time to let the knotty situations grow more enticingly tangled time to enjoy a laugh if any of them are on offer. The constant hammering and yammering of this movie drives you out of involvement with its women. And then theres that perfume girl -- so obviously a gold-digger so entirely without redeeming traits. Its hard to believe that any sensible man let alone a master of the Wall Street universe would take such a creature out for a drink let alone marry her even back in 1936. She was a vulgar cliche when she rolled out of Luces typewriter and neither time nor Diane English has improved her. Or anything else for that matter. Take this new invention for example Mary has a daughter named Molly (India Ennenga) who is a standard-issue adolescent Wise Child victim-commentator on the adult follies proceeding around her. At one point she is discovered burning her tampons symbolizing her desire not to become a woman. Thats an understandable feeling given the adult company shes been obliged to keep. But its a stupid sequence neither funny nor touching nor well prepared for. It is merely awkward and desperate like everything else in this film which is in fact -- and Im choosing my words carefully here -- one of the worst movies Ive ever seen.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Women 1/2 (out of four)Stars Meg Ryan Annette Bening Eva MendesDirector Diane EnglishDistributor PicturehouseRating PG-13 for sex-related material language some drug use and brief smokingRunning time 1 hour 54 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Defanged and drippy the remake of 1939s The Women seems to have been made for the dullard granddaughters of the sassy sharp society matrons in George Cukors campy original. The fast-paced repartee catty wit and social bite of the original -- based on the 1936 play by Clare Boothe Luce -- has fallen victim to the dictates of political correctness and female empowerment. And glamour has taken a nose dive as well. If theyre going to retool a beloved movie filmmakers should at least try to capture the spirit of the original. In this new Women written and directed by Diane English not only are key roles miscast but giving it a modern-day reworking at all is a mistake. Infidelity and divorce are not the scandals they were nearly 70 years ago. And class division a key part of the original has been undercut by reconfiguring nearly all of the players as working women. Meg Ryan plays Mary Haines whose life is turned upside down when she learns her husband is cheating with sexy Crystal (Eva Mendes) a salesgirl at Saks. Ryan is not convincing or even sympathetic in a role thats meant to be the movies emotional core. In the original Norma Shearer was the picture of warmth and dignity traits that elude Ryan entirely. Sylvie Fowler (Annette Bening) who in the original was a nasty gossip played by Rosalind Russell has been sanitized hampered by an excess of integrity. Ryans confidantes include Jada Pinkett Smith as an openly gay woman given little to do but sing the praises of lesbian love and Debra Messing as a frazzled Mother Earth type. Its as if English missed the point. The Women was not about the healing bonds of friendship. It was about humorous revenge. Though aspects of the 1939 comedy seem silly and shrill now they were at least consistently entertaining. Where the original was deliciously loopy and melodramatic fun this one is watered-down sappy and earnest.

As a result the razor-edge dialogue becomes dull and the deliberate retooling of the characters (including Jada Pinkett Smith as a lecherous tequila-swilling lesbian) is so contrived it hurts.As in the original theres not a man to be seen onscreen (with one teeny-weenie exception) although their presence is always acknowledged and felt.What keeps the remake of The Women from sinking to the bottom of Lake Remake are the cast members of a certain age Bette Midler as a wisecracking agent Cloris Leachman as a canny housekeeper who can keep a secret Annette Bening as the fashion magazine editor struggling to save her professional skin and especially Candice Bergen who is magnificent as Marys seen-it-all mother.With best friends Sylvie (Bening) Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Smith) Mary seems to have a charmed life of lunches with the girls thanks to the aid of a housekeeper and live-in nanny for her 12-year-old.When Sylvie hears from chatty Saks manicurist Tanya (Debi Mazar) that the perfume spritzer girl downstairs Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes) is making time with Marys hubby the girls dive head-first into the churning gossip pool emerging only long enough to drag Mary in.Marys denial about the affair gives way to bargaining and anger and she vows to throw the bum out.As in the original the showdown takes place in the OK Corral of a lingerie change room where Mary confronts her rival. Quietly elegant Norma Shearer took on cool cat Joan Crawford in the original a shocker of a scene for its sexual references. The script remains the same in the remake but Ryan arms flapping and eyes rolling isnt up to the dramatic task and Mendes lacks the simmering menace the moment cries out for.Following on the high heels of the Sex and the City movie friendship betrayal and forgiveness are key to this story. But the friendships in The Women seem superficial by comparison to Sarah Jessica Parker and her pals.English has lost a golden opportunity to update a classic film and has chosen instead to sanitize and modernize squandering all the spark for a flaccid chick flick.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Meg Ryan Eva Mendes Annette Bening Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith. Written and directed by Diane English. Based on the script for the 1939 film by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin and the original play by Clare Boothe Luce. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The year 1939 which saw the release of films such as ""The Wizard of Oz"" ""Gone With the Wind"" ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" ""Ninotchka"" and ""Dark Victory"" is still considered the single greatest year in Hollywoods history. George Cukors ""The Women"" may not be among the all-time greats but its still a classic thanks to its all-female cast its vicious send-up of ""ladies who lunch"" and amazing performances by Joan Crawford Rosalind Russell and Mary Boland. Its easy to understand why writer-director Diane English wanted to re-mine this rich comic vein with a 21st century remake. But the fact is that English at least cant update ""The Women"" without removing its politically incorrect and hopelessly dated structural underpinnings. Viewed from the vantage point of our more enlightened time Cukors film is a guilty pleasure. Take away all the antiquated ideas about womens societal roles and its very earnest often engaging but not quite as much of a pleasure. Typical happy ending For those who never saw Cukors original whose screenplay by Anita Loos (""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"") and Jane Murfin was based on the Broadway play by Clare Boothe Luce the central plot element is the seemingly perfect marriage of endlessly sunny and noble Mrs. Stephen Haines (Norma Shearer). This was back in the days when a married woman was always referred to by her husbands name of course. Mary Haines life falls apart when her so-called friends find out that her husband is fooling around with trashy perfume saleswoman Crystal Allen (Crawford in one of her best performances). Marys first inclination is to try to tough it out but the situation becomes impossible once Marys friend Sylvia Fowler (Russell proving to Hollywood that she was a great comedian) stirs things up and Mary hightails it to Nevada to get what gossip columnists used to call ""Reno-vated"" - divorced. Of course it all gets sorted out Stephen sees the error of his ways and the film ends with Mary rushing back toward his never-seen arms. In the new version Mary (Meg Ryan) is a modern woman who correctly believes she can have it all. A loving wife and mother to teenage daughter Molly (India Ennenga) Mary has a career as a dress designer for her fathers clothing company. In an instant it all disappears She finds out that Stephen is having an affair and her father fires her. But at least she has the support of her friends like Sylvie Fowler (Annette Bening) the editor of an upscale womens magazine; Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) a full-time mom looking for creative outlets between serial pregnancies; Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett Smith) a very out lesbian writer; and Marys mom Catherine (Candice Bergen) who reveals that Marys father strayed a bit and the best way to deal with it is to wait it out. In both films waiting it out becomes impossible when Sylvia/Sylvie spills the beans to a gossip columnist the affair becomes public and Mary is forced to take action. Where Russells Sylvia is just a backbiting meddler Benings Sylvie otherwise loyal to Mary has a moment of weakness when her job is on the line and confirms Stephens affair to columnist Bailey Smith (Carrie Fisher) to get Smith to write a story for her magazine. Journey of discovery Although Cukors film was set in the dark ages Shearers Mary isnt a total wimp. Yes shell do anything to get Stephen back and is willing to forgive him his trespasses with the tramp but shes also been on a small journey of discovery. Shes found a few vertebrae of backbone at least and is ready to stand up against women like Crystal and for that matter false friends like Sylvia. That journey isnt enough for 2008 of course. At first Ryans Mary too wants Stephen back but she eventually learns she needs to get her own sense of self back first. Brava. Very correct. Very noble. The trouble is English doesnt make much of it very enjoyable. Shes so careful to resist the Neanderthal sensibilities of the original film she often neglects to make her version of the story well fun. Worse its only occasionally believable. Ryan whose career has foundered in recent years is very appealing here but in key moments she seems to be doing a Dan Quayle imitation i.e. deer in headlights. Shes just found out her husband is fooling around on the side. What does she do? She blinks a few times and goes to lunch with Mom. Eventually she gets angry but still her reactions are too controlled to seem entirely authentic. Its one thing to want to celebrate womens strength but does being strong meaning failing to show emotion? Bening has some wonderful moments including a terrific scene where she tries to help Marys daughter deal with the crisis in her parents marriage. That fact that shes so damn good at all times may disappoint those who rightly love Russells over-the-top performance as Sylvia but theres a credibility problem in the Bening character She simply has too much character to compromise her friendship with Mary as she does. Of course she regrets it later. We do as well but worse we dont really believe it. Bergen back working with her ""Murphy Brown"" creator is really extraordinary as Marys mother. Her part is small but she gives it wonderful nuance and depth of character. Also doing superb work are Messing; Pinkett Smith; Cloris Leachman as Marys housekeeper; and Debi Mazar as the tattling manicurist. Eva Mendes is OK as ""the other woman"" only if you never saw Crawfords Crystal Allen. Where Crawford gave Crystal the ability to purr one moment and scratch the eyes out of anyone who threatened her the next Mendes plays Crystal on one note. Bette Midler has a cameo as Leah Miller a kind of Sue Mengers-ish Hollywood agent who offers Mary some advice at the health spa which substitutes for the Nevada ranch of the original film. Midler who seems to be channeling her ""For the Boys"" character is wasted here. Part of the reason is that the pivotal role of the Countess de Lave in Cukors film had to be cut back to a cameo once English dispensed with the subplot of Crystal stealing the countess latest husband Buck Winston after she finally becomes the new Mrs. Stephen Haines. Fails to connect But does ""The Women"" fail to connect only by comparison to the politically incorrect 1939 film? Alas no. Even those who never saw Cukors movie will feel something is missing in Englishs version. Yes some of whats missing is humor and snappy dialogue but that could be forgiven if only some of the characters were more believable and the direction not quite as uneven. English knows how to get good performances out of her cast but her pacing is languid and sloppy so much so that one is tempted to believe that for all she knows about pacing a 30-minute sitcom English isnt quite ready to tackle the longer form. -- Advisory The film contains minimal coarse language.

"Women The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; women-the ) Women The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Women is appropriately named. For its nearly 110 minute running time theres nary a man to be found not even in the background of crowd scenes. This movie takes place in the same world as Sex and the City where there are only three things that matter to women gossiping with friends painting men in the worst possible light and shopping. The Women contains its fair share of all three especially the first and third. While the dialogue lacks some of the crispness of Sex and the City the film as a whole proves to be more tolerable because the characters arent as fundamentally repugnant. In fact the lead - Meg Ryans Mary Haines - looks sounds and feels like Sally Albright 20 years later. If only the filmmakers had figured this out early enough to name her husband-in-absentia ""Harry."" (Carrie Fisher even has a cameo to strengthen the connection.) Mary is one of four female buddies. (Sex and the City defined that proper sisterhood bonding requires a quartet. We also see this in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants an infinitely better film than either Sex and the City or The Women.) The other three sides of the quadrangle are Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening) the cutthroat editor of a womens magazine; Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) a married woman who keeps popping out kids; and Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett Smith) the token minority/lesbian/youngster all rolled into one. The latest juicy piece of gossip to land on their plates is that Marys supposedly loving husband Steven is having an affair with Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes) a perfume girl at Saks 5th Avenue. At first Mary tries to deal with this as advised by her mother (Candice Bergen) ignore it. When that doesnt work she confronts Crystal then Steven before filing for divorce. Eventually when separated from her husband she discovers two truths she has not been a good mother and she has never figured out who she really is. The films second half represents her journey of self-discovery. The Women is based on a 1939 movie that was directed by George Cukor (and in turn was adapted from a play). Diane English perhaps best known as the writer of TVs Murphy Brown has updated it transposing the characters 70 years into the future. The result is uneven. Some scenes sparkle the ones featuring Candice Bergen and Bette Midler and the mother/daughter interaction between Mary and Molly (India Ennenga). Others are overwrought artificial or saccharine with the ending in particular falling into all three categories. Glaring by its omission are any scenes between Mary and Steven. I understand that the conceit of the film is that its an ""actor free"" zone but The Women handles this relationship so clumsily that its on-screen absence calls attention to itself. Having two domestic helpers talk about the break-up argument (which we never see) fails to fill the void. Would it have irreparably damaged The Womens female purity to have included a scene or two with a man? Its one thing to have an all-female cast because no men are necessary; its another to employ contrivances to contort the script so that none appear. The cast features an impressive array of star power but none of these actresses except perhaps Bergen and Midler (neither of whom has a lot of screen time) is burning at full wattage. Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing feel superfluous while Annette Bening seems to be coasting relying on her reputation and innate charisma to pull her through. Meanwhile Meg Ryan is doing her best to re-create the kind of characters she played back when she was box office gold. (Pre-Russell Crowe that is.) In a way its impressive that shes so successful and virtually impossible to believe shes 46 years old. (Watching her I was reminded of a line from When Harry Met Sally in which she bemoans turning 40 a in eight years.) This is Diane Englishs directing debut and it shows. Also in evidence is her familiarity with television. The movie is shot like a TV show with frequent intercut close-ups. Back-and-forth back-and-fortha| It becomes monotonous. Theres nothing visually interesting about this film and when English tries to do something ""innovative"" at the end using a split-screen it comes across as a desperate attempt to vary The Womens visual staleness. Based on her Murphy Brown work English has shown herself to be an adept perceptive and at times funny writer but too little of that is on display here. Aside from some pointed one-liners and occasionally effective conversations theres little in this screenplay worth savoring or remembering. The Women faced a long and rocky road making it to the big screen having first gained life in the mid-90s then going through a series of false starts before being made as an independent motion picture. The success of Sex and the City saved the film from either gathering more dust on some vault shelf or the oblivion of going straight-to-DVD. Its aimed at the same audience and its not hard to understand why. The two pictures are cut from the same cloth although its a little odd to find the veterans copying the relative newbies.

The Women (PG-13) Picturehouse (114 min.) Directed by Diane English. With Meg Ryan Annette Bening Eva Mendes Debra Messing. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey.TWO AND A HALF STARS In the original 1939 ""The Women"" the raciest line comes at the end when shopgirl-turned-mistress Joan Crawford turns a baleful eye on the society ladies who have avenged her husband-stealing. ""Theres a name for you ladies"" she snaps ""but it isnt used in high society -- outside of a kennel."" In the new 2008 ""The Women"" that line comes right at the beginning and its a throwaway. After all a coy allusion to ""bitch"" is fairly mild for an update that now has room for pot-smoking birth control devices oral sex jokes and a glam lipstick lesbian. (Somewhere George Cukor is spinning in his extremely tasteful grave.) Still theres one thing in this movies favor The old lines still work. Originally a hit play by Clare Boothe Luce the first ""The Women"" was the prototype for ""Sex and the City"" -- a Manhattan-centric movie about capable women who liked beauty parlors fashion and men (who in a neat conceit repeated here were never shown on screen.) It was a movie about friendship -- but also wickedly about how best friends could sometimes deliberately give the worst advice. In this long-gestating adaptation by Diane English -- the force behind ""Murphy Brown"" -- the smartest change is turning what was traditionally feminine into something more clearly feminist. Backbiting has been replaced largely by sisterhood; careers are more in evidence. And instead of the heroine simply taking back her straying husband (because pride is ""a luxury a woman in love cant afford"") here she also finds herself; its the femme comedy as empowerment fable. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with this cast either. Meg Ryan has her first good part in years (the Norma Shearer part for film buffs keeping track) as the deserted wife; Eva Mendes gets the old Crawford role as the calculating siren. Debra Messing gets the biggest laughs as an earth mother who cant seem to stop popping out babies; Annette Bening gets the best lines as the friend whose intentions might not be so friendly (Rosalind Russell in the original). While the slightly updated material works though the brand-new scenes mostly disappoint. Perhaps its been a long time -- too long -- since English was writing comedy. But a new scene showing Ryan and Bening mending bridges falls flat; an interlude at a health spa has no bite. And the multicultural tweaks arent as PC as English probably thinks they are Jada Pinkett Smith the one African-American character has a pointless part while Latina actress Mendes is stereotyped as the sexy spitfire. Nor is English directing her first movie any sort of stylist. The first black-and-white ""The Women"" had a wonderful completely arbitrary sequence when the characters went to a fashion show and suddenly everything switched to Technicolor; it was so self-conscious it was practically pre-post-modern. The only good device in this version comes under the credits as the characters are established by their shoes -- sensible artsy sexy or clunky. Yet -- like the sprawling apartments and lavish country homes the characters sweep through -- ""The Women"" has good bones and even an extensive (and occasionally misguided) renovation cant take away from them. The old jokes still work. The tried-and-true characters still strike sparks. And even if the best parts are warmed over the dish is still great. Rating note The film contains strong language and substance abuse. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

""Theres a name for women like that thats rarely used outside a kennel"" says one character in a line cribbed from the original and you have to scratch your head. ""Bitch"" wasnt used on-screen in 1939 and probably not onstage in 1936 when Clare Booth Luce introduced her farce about a group of bitchy Manhattan women on Broadway with an all-female cast a concept retained for the movie. Today you can hear the word at all hours on TV - not that there are any bitches in Englishs declawed version of ""The Women"" which is a drearily neutered tale of empowerment among aging upscale women that makes the film version of ""Sex and the City"" look positively edgy. Meg Ryan looking like a cartoon version of herself from 15 years ago - when she first signed on for the role - is naive Connecticut resident Mary Haines whose stockbroker husband has just left her for gold-digging Crystal who works at the perfume counter at Saks. Crystal was played in 1939 by Joan Crawford and a good part of what makes the 1939 ""The Women"" such fun is the real-life enmity between Crawford and the actress who played Mary Norma Shearer queen of the MGM lot. A severely miscast Eva Mendes - she looks great but she just isnt mean enough - has inherited Crawfords role which has been much cut back so as to build up the part of Sylvie (nee Sylvia) Fowler who just cant resist gossiping about her best friends misfortune. This supporting role which made Rosalind Russell a star now belongs to Annette Bening who this time around is a struggling magazine editor. (Mary who still has a young daughter works as a fashion designer for her never-seen father.) English finds it necessary to justify Sylvies betrayal - shes blackmailed by a Page Six reporter (Carrie Fisher) who threatens to publish an unflattering piece about Sylvies problems with her staff. The movie thus becomes about whether Mary can ever forgive the much older-looking Sylvie - rather than whether Mary will triumph over Crystal. Guess which one is a lot more fun to watch? There are lines from the original script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin dropped in here and there but they fit awkwardly at best in the new feminist context. And Englishs directing debut is as flat as her screenplay. In the biggest crime of all English has cut the funniest sequence in the 1939 movie - a hair-pulling fight at a Western dude ranch - and substituted a trip to a spa in the Berkshires where a jaded Hollywood agent (a cameoing Bette Midler) lectures Mary on looking out for No. 1. There is actually a lot of tiresome lecturing going on here much of it coming from Englishs old ""Murphy Brown"" star Candice Bergen who scores most of the very scarce laughs as Marys mom. Bergen who also played Ryans mom in ""Rich amp; Famous"" back during the Reagan administration also gets stuck with the movies most grotesque scene set in a plastic surgeons office. I really dont want to talk about the oddness of casting Ryan in a movie that complains about women being forced to update their appearance. Then Id have to talk about the even bigger irony of putting the actress (whose perkiness is way past the expiration date) in a movie about marital infidelity. The 1939 ""The Women"" had an all-star cast that included Joan Fontaine and Paulette Goddard among others. But English has little idea of what to do with say Debra Messing as a woman with many children. Jada Pinkett Smiths sole function as an African-American lesbian is to extend the movies demographic reach. ""The Women"" was actually remade before. That was in 1956 as a musical with June Allyson and Joan Collins battling over Leslie Nielsen (yes there were men in that one). This latest version manages to be even more pointless - no easy feat. THE WOMEN What a bitch. Running time 116 minutes. Rated PG- 13 (profanity sexuality).

"The Women (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Women (PG-13)  Havent we met these women before? Meg Ryan left and Annette Bening are shown in a scene from ""The Women"". Photo Claudette Barius. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald The women in The Women are wealthy New Yorkers who spend their days shopping getting their nails done gossiping having lunch -- wait does any of this sound scarily familiar? Writer-director Diane English (from TVs Murphy Brown) spent 13 years trying to get this remake of the 1939 George Cukor satire off the ground and she managed to do it the same year Sex and the City became a movie. Hows that for bad timing? It might turn out to be good timing. Anyone who just cant wait for Sex and the City to hit DVD can just go see The Women and pretend theyre watching the next installment in the franchise. You dont have to squint all that much to imagine the perky heartbroken Mary (Meg Ryan) upset over her husbands infidelity as a married version of Carrie; her older single career-oriented friend Sylvie (Annette Bening) as Samantha; the domesticated family-driven Edie (Debra Messing) as Charlotte; and the brassy opinionated Alex (Jada Pinkett Smith) as Miranda. The rest of The Women is just as reminiscent of Sex and the City including detours to fashion shows and visits to the offices of Vogue-style magazines but without the contemporary insights or witty dialogue. English lifts entire chunks of text from the original film (itself based on a 1936 play) for some scenes which often sounds incredibly dated (Theres a name for women like you but its rarely heard outside of a kennel.) For most of the picture though English writes her own lines but they rarely rise above sitcom level. Bad sitcom level. (``Dont be bitter. It leads to Botox.) Like the Cukor film practically no males are ever seen in The Women even though they are usually the subject of conversations including yet one more tirade about mens channel-surfing habits or their tendency to drink straight from the milk carton which is to chick flicks what slow-motion fireballs are to shoot-em-ups. Although the original play was critical of its high-society snoots The Women takes an affectionate view of its characters turning them into a Saks Fifth Avenue sisterhood. In supporting roles Candice Bergen (as Marys mom) Eva Mendes (as the other woman) Cloris Leachman (as Marys maid) and Bette Midler (as a pothead talent agent) are all OK. Any of them in fact would have made more interesting heroines than the four leads whose characters are so familiar the movie might have well been called The Types. Bergen also gets the films best line delivered as shes sitting down to lunch with her daughter I ordered you a gimlet. I know you dont drink in the afternoon but you will eventually so you might as well start now. Thats good advice for anyone going to see The Women too. Its not every movie that makes you wish Vin Diesel would run in and start blowing up stuff.

Friends (Meg Ryan left and Annette Bening) lean on each other when times get tough in The Women. Photo CLAUDETTE BARIUS PICTUREHOUSE FILMS | ASSOCIATED PRESS The Women 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Some might call it a chick flick but The Women is obviously science fiction. It takes place in a surreal parallel universe unoccupied by men except as unseen participants in cell-phone conversations. With one charming exception not a single masculine entity appears in this film which stuffs every scene -- every party restaurant fashion show store -- with sleek 21st-century exemplars of upper-crust New York metropolitan womanhood. The only indication that Y chromosomes might be lurking behind a curtain? The plot. Without a man it would be nothing. I am all for alternate-universe filmmaking (Bugsy Malone no grown-ups anywhere) but shouldnt an all-female movie about empowered grrrlhood revolve around something other than a lousy husband? An off-screen lousy husband at that? You cant even see the guy and hes still the star of the show. What chance do women have if their one shot at big-budget cinematic domination devotes most of its time and dialogue to a jerk named Steve? ""What is this a 1930s movie?"" asks Meg Ryans character Mary Haines the wronged woman whose deleterious spouse takes up with a ""spritzer girl"" at the Saks Fifth Avenue perfume counter. The line is writer-director Diane Englishs homage to her source material George Cukors classic 1939 orgy of estrogen -- itself based on a play by Clare Boothe Luce. This new version isnt a remake exactly. Its more of a refitting tweaked and cut -- like the haute-couture fashions parading down the runway -- to suit a new era of femininity. The original starred Norma Shearer as the suffering Mary and Joan Crawford as her rival that floozy Crystal Allen. Shearer was stoic; Crawford was a snake with painted eyebrows. The swankest performance (or my favorite in any case) was Rosalind Russells as Sylvia Marys gossipy gal pal here played by Annette Bening with delicious savoir faire but a bit less zip. Rounding out the foursome of friends Jada Pinkett Smith as Alex the no-nonsense lesbian (that wasnt in the original); Debra Messing as Edie the ever-breeding earth-mother; and last but not least Ryans Mary a suburban supermom trying to juggle motherhood spousehood charity work and an unrewarding job with her fathers clothing business. We first learn of Marys marital troubles from a blabbermouthed manicurist (Debi Mazar) who spills to Sylvie who spills to Edie who then together spill to Alex who persuades them finally to spill to Mary. But by then Mary already knows because the same manicurist inadvertently spilled to her ages ago. Ryans Mary is a far more independent creature than Shearers -- who faced the loss of her husband as a loss of income and status -- but she has the undeniable irrepressible warmth and decency that the part demands. And theres a scene in the kitchen with Ryan and a pair of housekeepers (including Cloris Leachman) that does things with a stick of butter I never imagined possible. The glossy ensemble cast includes Candice Bergen as Marys pragmatic mom Carrie Fisher as a tabloid gossip columnist and Bette Midler as Leah a serial divorcee Mary meets at sleep-away camp. (Please dont ask me to explain this because I cant.) The weak link is Eva Mendes as Crystal. Shes supposed to be a vicious shrewd and conniving hussy; she comes across as just too stupid to believe. Gorgeous sure. But she cant fill Crawfords size-4 shoes. Fourteen years in the making The Women marks a serviceable directorial debut for English an Emmy-winning TV writer and producer who created Murphy Brown. She goes light on the cattiness heavy on sisterhood and seems determined to bolster everyones self-esteem. Wedged after the credits is an ad for Dove soaps ""Real Beauty"" campaign -- just a smidge hypocritical in a movie rife with makeovers manicures skinny models and socket-bruising cosmetic surgery. In this world without men some women still go under the knife to please them. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Columbia Mens/Womens Vent Cush Flip Sandals for 15 + free...

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED September 10 2008 at 152 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 228 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Timing matters in comedy but also in movie making. So after years of rumblings the remake of the fast- talking ""The Women"" at last arrives in theaters. The all-female comedy about marital and professional strife has a promising roster of stars among them Meg Ryan Annette Bening Eva Mendes and Jada Pinkett Smith. Yet in spite of the casting and honorable revamps it feels more dated than the 1939 original did for its time period. Nearly 15 years ago Diane English creator of the hit sitcom ""Murphy Brown"" decided she wanted to update George Cukors extravagant film. Based on a hit Broadway play by Clare Boothe Luce and tidied up for the censors by Anita Loos Jane Murfin and Cukor it was a comedy of awful manners between women of the upper reaches. Original gossip girl Hedda Hopper referred to it as ""that feminine kennel."" And it was indeed the sort of bitchfest that has given drag queens yards of fabric to work with. In anticipation of the release Virgin has stocked up on copies of Cukors version. See it. Whatever feels old-fashioned about it is made up for with a breakneck repartee hard to come by in contemporary films. Though Bening gets a couple of zingers in. The cover art features the top-billed stars Norma Shearer Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell in her first -- and terrifically naughty -- comedic turn. Beneath the title the tagline reads ""Its All About the Men."" And indeed it was though they were nowhere in sight. Crawford played Crystal Allen a perfume counter girl who catches the eye and more of the well-off Stephen Haines. Shearer was Mrs. Stephen Haines or Mary. Russell Mrs. Harry Fowler. Russells Sylvia was Marys frenemy before such a thing existed. (For an enjoyable history of the casting read Emanuel Levys ""George Cukor Master of Elegance."") In the remake Ryan is the morally upstanding Mary and Bening is Sylvia. Eva Mendes -- arguably the Raquel Welch of her generation -- is the knockout perfume hawker who KOs the Haines marriage. First-time film director English flips the script dramatically. And she should be lauded for wanting to rescue a film from its profoundly negative ideas about female friendship. Here Mary and Sylvia are best friends. Their clique includes Edie Cohen (Messing) a mother whose generative skills have produced four daughters but who cant quite figure out what she wants to do when she grows up. And Smith plays acerbic humor writer and lipstick lesbian Alex Fisher. Confronted with the news that Stephen is cheating on Mary the friends no longer rush gleefully to deliver the bad news but gather to protect. Candice Bergen arrives to offer motherly advice to her heartbroken daughter. A nice moment occurs when she upends Marys assumptions about her parents marriage. English has given her women contemporary headaches. Not only has Marys hubby strayed but also her father has sacked her as second in their family business. And 12-year-old daughter Molly (India Ennegna) is fast becoming the stranger teen girls so often do especially under the duress of divorce. Sylvia is the editor in chief of Cachet a womens fashion mag. As much as shed like to make it thoughtfully feminist the demand is to make it profitably post-feminist. In trying to keep her dream job Sylvia betrays Mary. Rummaging the studio racks for Golden Age garments is complicated business. A number of classics that featured fascinating females would be hard to dust off without radical alterations Cukors ""Philadelphia Story"" immediately comes to mind. Sure its been done but with middling results. Over the years weve been treated to wittier reimaginings of the ideas and energy contained in ""The Women."" There was ""Waiting to Exhale."" One particularly clever episode of ""Frasier"" ends with Kelsey Grammer flinging open the door with the same expectant hope Shearer wears on her face in the final scene of ""The Women."" According to ""George Cukor Master of Elegance"" the director once said that if ""The Women"" were remade ""Everybody would be screwing everybody and everybody would know about it."" How could he know the franchise that remade ""The Women"" in the best sense ""Sex and the City"" would often seem just that. Yet it would do so much more to gaze into the complicated hearts of gals. ""The Women"" PG-13 for sex-related material language some drug use and brief smoking. 1 hour 44 minutes. Written and directed by Diane English; from Clare Boothe Luces 1936 play and Anita Loos and Jane Murfins screenplay for the 1939 film; starring Meg Ryan Annette Bening Eva Mendes Debra Messing Jada Pinkett Smith Candice Bergen Carrie Fisher Debi Mazar Bette Midler Opens today at area theaters.

Comments The Women Diane English creator of TVs Murphy Brown directs this update of the 1939 George Cukor melodrama (based on Clare Boothe Luces play) filing away its barbed edges in a knee-jerk bow to sisterhood--the antithesis of Luces take on female ""friendship"" as minefield. When seasoned comediennes Cloris Leachman Candice Bergen and Bette Midler arent on-screen English falls back on Meg Ryan in the Norma Shearer role of a saintly wife with a cheating husband. But Ryan barely refining her When Harry Met Sally persona is a dud; Annette Bening playing the best friend who sells her out to a tabloid is better in the scenes she doesnt share with her. Still the script has a few zingers and for the guys dragged along to this superfluous exercise theres Eva Mendes as the home wrecker in La Perla undies. PG-13 118 min.

"The unbearable lightness of Women - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie review The unbearable lightness of Women By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / September 11 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + You should start to worry about ""The Women"" in the first two minutes. Lots of shots of womens legs in expensive shoes come hurtling toward us. We dont get many arms shoulders backs or God forbid personalities. Instead our first close-up is of two sniping dogs.If Diane English meant to set the tone with a jab of symbolic satire maybe she could have cast the whole movie with house pets. Instead she wrangles human stars for her remake of Clare Boothe Luces manless 1936 play about a troupe of rich New York women - here Annette Bening Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett-Smith - who sic themselves on the mistress (Eva Mendes) of their friends husband. As the wronged friend Mary Meg Ryan trudges through the movie powered on maximum-cute righteousness. Her spunk accessorizes nicely with the cha-cha-cha music on the soundtrack.Luces play was dipped in acid and the film George Cukor made of it in 1939 was a barbed fashion show -cattiness and glamour. Neither is the riot it must have been all those years ago but you could see the mockery both wanted to make of rich ladies with too much time on their hands. English has spent years trying to get her remake off the ground. For any number of reasons (many to do with casting) it kept not happening. Now that its here you have to wonder why she ever fought so hard to see it through.For one thing the movie is a work of ambivalence. Is English making fun of these women? Or is she making a pilot for Lifetime? Its hard to tell. Benings character the endangered editor of a stagnating womens magazine is the most sensible of everybody and exhibits what wit the movie has. But within minutes of our meeting her she enters a Saks Fifth Avenue and as she eyes the merchandise the screen goes green with a military readout that may as well be from ""Predator."" We have a bionic shopper on our hands.Ryan meanwhile is all her usual pouts quirks whines and crinkled faces. Shes now like a Meg Ryan impersonator. English has given the impersonation all the trimmings too - galoshes sundresses endless golden hair to toss out of her face a garden to tend while talking on her cellphone an SUV to climb out of a giant dog to go bounding around her Connecticut house. Eventually Mary finds the only trimming that matters self-empowerment. After the humiliation of a messy public divorce she straightens her hair (Id call the new cut Chewbacca Barbie but you decide) and attempts to make her fashion dreams come true with what can only be described as designer nursewear.The movies lightness seems forced to the point of being unbearable See girls really do just wanna have fun - and babies and faithful husbands and meaningful careers and anything by Narciso Rodriguez. But glibness doesnt become English - not the woman whose sitcom ""Murphy Brown"" gave us Candice Bergen as the intelligent symbol of working womanhood and laughed respectfully at the myth of having it all. Now Bergen is playing Ryans cosmetically altered mother in ""The Women"" and looking none too thrilled to be. Bette Midler arrives too briefly to make funny faces and a stab at wisdom. But the movie is afraid of gender politics (although Messings chronically pregnant character might excite Sarah Palin fans) and oblivious to issues of class Boy women in the service industry are annoying.You have to wonder whether shows like ""Designing Women"" and ""Sex and the City"" and the shallow movie it produced long ago obviated the need for a remake of ""The Women."" Besides its often less George Cukor or for that matter Pedro Almodovar and more ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.""Whenever I wanted to give English the benefit of the doubt somebody burned a tampon or went on a yoga retreat. Her filmmaking undermines her credibility. This is never more true than when Messings water breaks and Bening Pinkett-Smith and Ryan hyperventilate by her side in the delivery room. Ryans on the phone. Pinkett-Smith is shoving ice cubes into her mouth and pretending to pass out. Everyone screams while the camera swings like a runaway yo-yo. I wanted something I never thought I would an epidural.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

So instead of characterizing its central figure Mary Haines (Ryan) as an innocent pup amid the attack canines English takes the more optimistic view that even rabid middle-aged dogs can learn new tricks - like obedience to friends.Nice message if one with considerably less bite than the source material. English has taken Luces insight that for women friendship can be a lethal weapon and blunted it in the warm bath of self-help.And because Luces account of how women behave in men-free zones prefigured Sex and the City that effervescent TV and movie phenom also makes Englishs remix seem a tad flat. Maybe its the watered-down sitcommy direction (this marks the directorial debut of English creator of Murphy Brown) that dilutes this cocktails fizz.The distinction between the upscale milieus of SATC and The Women may seem subtle. But in their niche universes SATC is an edgy 35 drinks Mojitos reads Vogue and shops Bergdorfs; The Women is a centered 48 sips martinis rips into O and haunts Saks.It is fair to say that Saks is to The Women what the Sistine Chapel is to The Agony and the Ecstasy - a sacred place for prayer communion and confession.At the salon of the Fifth Avenue fashion emporium married Mary (Ryan tossing her ringlets like a bowl of fusilli) learns from a chatty manicurist that her husband Steven is dallying with sultry Saks perfume spritzer Crystal (Eva Mendes).Her friends Sylvie (Bening) a magazine editor; Alex (Jada Pinkett Smith) a novelist; and Edie (Debra Messing) an earthy mama already have heard the news.As Marys sharp-tongued pals deliberate how to break it to her they cant help but savor this juicy morsel of ill fortune. A fashion designer with a Connecticut estate adorable daughter and Wall Street spouse Mary has the Olympian life they all wanted but being mere mortals never got.If her gal pals arent happy exactly at the prospect of Marys humiliation they are secretly pleased that in her misery she is rendered mortal like them. And when Mary finds that one of them has confirmed her marital blitz to a New York tabloid it leads to an estrangement as painful as that from her husband.English wrangles her talent like a virtuoso. Best is Murphy Brown herself Candice Bergen as Marys mother Catherine who counsels forgiveness when others counsel revenge. Also quite fine in a movie where the piquant sides are tastier than the bland main dish is Bening whose Sylvie reveals more than one dimension.Ryan has the thankless task of delivering the films sapless homily Knowing what you want is the key to personal and professional happiness. (She is in excellent company. Mary Haines is a role that defeated both Norma Shearer - in 1939s The Women - and June Allyson - in the 1957 music remake The Opposite Sex.)In writing this I feel like a hung jury. My final verdict on The Women Enjoyed not overjoyed.The Women 1/2 (out of four stars) Written and directed by Diane English (adapted from the Clare Boothe Luce play and 1939 film). With Meg Ryan Annette Bening Candice Bergen Eva Mendes Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith.

Well yeah probably. But it may be the most disappointing given all the effort that went into it.The 1939 satire on which its based has - despite its sexist bent - become something of a classic thanks to Anita Loos sharp script and George Cukors merciless direction. Diane English and Meg Ryan have been intent on revising this story for so many years one assumes they saw something essential at its core. But whatever their inspiration you wont find it here.Norma Shearer originally played Mary Haines a socialite whose backstabbing friends gleefully discover her husband is having an affair. Todays Mary (Ryan in cutie-pie mode) is staunchly supported by her lazily sketched sisterhood the Workaholic (Annette Bening) the Pregnant One (Debra Messing) and the Lesbian (Jada Pinkett Smith). CLICK FOR A PHOTO GALLERY OF HOLLYWOODS BITTEREST MARRIAGE MELTDOWNS.Marys husband has taken up with Crystal (Eva Mendes) who sells perfume at Saks. (Thereby providing the movie with one of many shameless opportunities for product placement.)Though Mary attempts to overlook this betrayal the crisis cant be ignored once a gossip columnist (Carrie Fisher) gets wind of it.While Englishs script is as bland as Loos was biting she seems oddly unaware that her impressions of modern womanhood are equally damning. Why on earth for example would she give so many jokes about plastic surgery and Botox to actresses who appear unable to lift their own eyebrows? (No were not naming names. But you know who we mean.)Making things even worse Loos vision of women weathering the ups and downs of romance together has already been updated to infinitely better effect.

"Preachy thy name is Women - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-WomenMOVIE REVIEW Preachy thy name is WomenDiane Englishs adaptation of the 30s play and film gets bogged down despite the A-list cast.September 12 2008|Kenneth Turan | Times Movie Critic In ""The Women"" suburban wife and mother Mary Haines comes to see the error of trying to be all things to all people. Its too bad that the film shes in didnt learn the same lesson and instead tries way too hard be everything for all women.""The Women"" is an updating of the celebrated 1939 George Cukor-directed film about adultery divorce and friendship that starred Norma Shearer Joan Crawford Rosalind Russell Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine. Once you know the remakes history you can at least understand why writer-director Diane English strove to include a virtual laundry list of causes and crises in womens lives in her new version.For one thing the original ""Womens"" notion of an all-female cast was something Hollywood has pretty much not tried again since that picture to this. For another it took English best known as the creator of TVs ""Murphy Brown"" 14 years to get this project made. Given those statistics its no wonder that English decided to use the film as a kind of bulletin board to post everything she ever wanted to say about the place of women in the world.While the original film written by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin from a play by Clare Boothe Luce saw itself as a catty entertainment about New York society women coping with the infidelity of the husband of one of their friends English has something grander and more complex in mind.Graced with a big-name cast including Meg Ryan as wife Mary Annette Bening Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith as her best friends and Eva Mendes as the home wrecker this version sees itself as both a farce and a manifesto a glorification of female friendship and a celebration of womens need for self-realization.And when it comes to issues ""The Women"" plays like a years worth of stories from a glossy magazine.In no particular order the film deals with childbirth face-lifts sexual techniques career women who neglect their children teenage girls with self-image problems men who dont believe in women men who have trouble with successful women (not the same thing) the betrayal of female friendships the perils of careers in a mans world and quite possibly more.All that would be a handful to pull off for the most experienced filmmaker but English has never directed before and it shows. The visual choices she makes in ""The Women"" are invariably static and except for whatever energy the performers can manage the storytelling has a dispiriting flatness to it.""The Womens"" story starts roughly the same way the 1939 film does with the discovery that Marys never-seen husband Steven is having an affair with Crystal Allen (an intentionally provocative Mendes) the woman behind the perfume counter -- ""the spritzer girl"" to be exact -- at Saks Fifth Avenue.Marys best friends including magazine editor Sylvie Fowler (Bening) gay writer Alex Fisher (Pinkett Smith) and supermom Edie Cohen (Messing) first try to decide whether to tell Mary and then what to advise her after she finds out the truth.After this initial setup however ""The Women"" becomes unfocused as it stumbles over all the points it wants to make. Given Englishs writing skills the dialogue doesnt help as much as it should tending too much toward one-liners that aim for raunchy whenever possible.Never particularly believable the story quickly unravels into schematic contrivance and wish-fulfillment fantasy. The actresses all try hard to bring a project they clearly believe in to life but that is rarely enough.Its hard to say whats sadder that ""The Womens"" intended audience had to wait 14 years for a film like this or that that long wait has been almost for naught.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--""The Women.""

Those are sound words of warning for any filmmaker (except for whoevers doing the latest version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers; those always seem to work out OK). Surely Diane English who wrote the screenplay and directed The Women knew what she was up against. George Cukors 1939 original is a classic of cattiness of back-biting snarkiness. Its like a long-ago precursor to The Gilmore Girls with rapid-fire dialogue coming at the audience every which way. Englishs remake changes the story somewhat and replaces a lot of the acid with honey. These women band together instead of falling apart. Thats fine as far as the idea goes but its during those moments that the film is at its weakest. Of course every movie stands on its own; much of the audience will be unaware of Cukors version. But they too will find The Women lacking. It has moments of humor but comes off less as a film about the empowerment of women - Englishs obvious goal - and more about the empowerment of the rich. Thats a tough pill to swallow for most people these days. Meg Ryan stars as Mary Haines whose husband has been working late a lot the past few weeks. While on the way to a party at Marys mansion Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening) a magazine editor under fire who could not be more self-centered if she surrounded herself with mirrors stops by the beauty salon for a manicure. While there her big-mouthed manicurist (Debi Mazar) tells Sylvia that a certain Mr. Haines is cheating on his wife with Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes) who sells perfume. Yep that Mr. Haines. Sylvia confides in Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) but they decide to say nothing. Instead they rig it so that Mary goes to the same manicurist so she can hear the story from her. That happens in the original as well but its done here without malice. Eventually Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett Smith) their other close friend also is brought up to date on the proceedings. So what to do? Nothing says Marys mother Catherine (Candice Bergen). Hardly say Marys friends. Mary eventually confronts Crystal as she does in the original - while Crystal is trying on lingerie. Comparisons may be unfair but theyre unavoidable Meg Ryan going toe-to-toe with Eva Mendes just doesnt pack the same punch as real-life rivals Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford facing off. Whatever the case Mary poor dear finds salvation by forging her own identity which in this case means starting a clothing line and having her mother pay for it. Nice work if you can get it. And true to the original story by the end of the film shes not opposed to the idea of reconciling with her husband. (Like in the 1939 version no men are shown at least until the very end and then its a gimmick.) Mendes is sexy if whiny as Crystal and Cloris Leachman is funny and occasionally wise as Marys maid. But the best performance is by Messing surprisingly as a sort of earth mother (at least in this crowd; she actually spends some time taking care of her own children) who alone among her friends does not treat every challenge in her life as a personal affront visited upon her by the universe. The Women isnt terrible. Theres too much talent here for that even if its displayed unevenly. But its something that might be even worse unnecessary at least as long as you can rent the original.

""Some kind of 30s movie?""Even without the 14-year struggle to get the Murphy Brown writers pet project past studio doubters it would be a tall order to remake Cukors 1939 hit let alone try to corral its proudly reactionary gender politics for 21st-century feminism (or whats left of it if Sarah Palin has her way). For one thing the original movie was made during a period when Hollywood eagerly cranked out womens movies by the dozen and raked in the profits accordingly. For another The Women -- a product of the creative tension between Cukor who in his tres gay way loved all women provided they came excitable and well-dressed and his source material Clare Boothe Luces viciously clever 1936 stage satire of Manhattan society dames -- was pretty out there for a mainstream movie. Luces play wasnt just an exhortation to the woman wronged by infidelity to stand by her man and manipulate him back into the nest but also a furiously conservative attack on the modern woman -- a play whose respectably married central character Mary (played by Norma Shearer) enters with a mannish stride smoking a pipe. Its only adultery that softens her contours brings a wistful glisten to her eye at every mention of her husband the heel and surrounds her with gushy girlfriend gossips who stand ready to rat her out as necessary.Luce may have been a creep but she was a fun creep full of piss and vinegar as she took deadly aim at the useless lives of flighty females with more money than sense. The Women knew what it was and in Cukors smooth hands carried itself with pride and unspeakably fabulous threads. Who knows what Englishs pudding of a remake thinks it is? Trailing negative buzz and a revolving door of A-list talent since its inception in 1994 The Women isnt so much incompetent -- though it has all the visual sumptuousness of a suburban rummage sale -- as it is hopelessly tame and muddled. It certainly doesnt help that the movies lead is completely lacking in the mature glamour that so entranced women filmgoers bracing for a world war and has had so much plastic correction that her features -- all but the ingenue eyes -- are immobilized (and this in a movie that sucks whatever laughs it can muster from the Botox-and-surgery subculture). Could that be Meg Ryan peering out from Goldie Hawns face? Since I have yet to encounter a Ryan comedy in which she fails to flap her hands while pulling on or peeling off woolly socks several fetching sizes too large for her dainty feet it must be she.Ryan is all wrong as a contented Connecticut supermom with a half-baked career whos shaken to her core by the news that her husband is having an affair with a Saks ""shpritzer girl"" (Eva Mendes). Mendes certainly looks the siren part in a black bustier getup from which only the whip is missing but thats as close as this warmly sensuous young actress gets to the spitting venom that made Joan Crawford so wickedly funny in the original. Indeed what makes this version so flaccid is the absence of a bona fide double-talking vixen in the entire coven -- and that includes Jada Pinkett Smith trying way too hard for lesbian hard body. As for the chief gossip herself happily single magazine editor Sylvia Fowler Ive always pictured Susan Sarandon in the Rosalind Russell part if only because she seems to have sprung fully formed from the same genetic material as the great (and similarly pop-eyed) actress. Still Annette Bening is a perfectly fine choice who gets the best line when she sweeps in and says ""This is my face deal with it"" before turning into a dithery ghost of Meryl Streeps caffeinated werewolf in The Devil Wears Prada. Other than interestingly the truly older women (Candice Bergen as Marys mom Cloris Leachman as a straight-shooting housekeeper and a woefully underused Bette Midler as a much-married playgirl) thats about as badass as anyone gets among this relentlessly well-intentioned lot.

Sep. 13 600pm As it happens Cukors screenwriters Anita Loos and Jane Murfin also softened the bitter edge of Luces dialogue enough to allow audiences to identify with Marys desire to recover her prodigal husband. But they never lost sight of the fact that the play was satire. Turning The Women into a girlfriend-solidarity movie (English has called her remake ""a love story between two women"") would have made Luce barf but true to her roots in television thats what the director has done. It proves fatal.Before you know it The Women has shrunk to fit the sewing form of a movie of the week whose heroine is briefly floored by adversity before rising from the ashes coiffed a la LOreal cause shes worth it and fully employed with a little help from her BFFs. Hear her roar -- or not. Cripplingly sensitive to its market potential The Women hedges its bets leaves its options open and covers every possible female demographic base before wilting into a gooey maternity-ward finale.Off the top of my head I can think of several gifted interpreters of women on the verge -- Nicole Holofcener (Lovely and Amazing) Tamara Jenkins (The Savages) or even Mr. Almodovar himself -- who could have planed away Luces viciousness without losing her satirical edge. Understandably English -- who put in the hard labor to bring her baby to term -- wanted to direct. But shes the wrong person for the job and willy-nilly she has reduced one of the wittiest womens comedies ever made to just another ho-hum chick flick. Lord knows this summer saw enough of those.THE WOMEN | Written and directed by DIANE ENGLISH based on the play by CLARE BOOTHE LUCE and the screenplay by ANITA LOOS and JANE MURFIN | Produced by VICTORIA PEARMAN MICK JAGGER BILL JOHNSON and ENGLISH | Released by Picturehouse | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

It had everything gossip and fashion shows and spa workouts plus a peek into the dishy manners of New York high society. Directed by George Cukor from a script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin (which was adapted from Claire Boothe Luces Broadway smash) the movie was a zinger-strewn orgy of feminine camaraderie and backbiting yet it also confronted the timeless issue of whether a happy marriage can -- and should -- survive an adulterous affair. The Women wasnt by any means a great movie but it had a polished acid vibrance and for all its over-the-top chatter an elegantly simple story. The new version written and directed by former Murphy Brown writer-producer Diane English sprawls all over the place in no small part because its trying so hard to be a luscious retrograde fantasy and a tale of 21st-century empowerment. Meg Ryan her hair so mega-permed it looks as if she were hiding under the worlds most expensive mop takes the Norma Shearer role Shes Mary Haines a wealthy Connecticut housewife whose world collapses when she learns -- from a blabby Saks Fifth Avenue manicurist (Debi Mazar) -- that her husband has been sleeping with the golddigger who works at the perfume counter. (This floozy is played by Eva Mendes sexy-vicious where Joan Crawford was sexy-psychotic.) Annette Bening in the Rosalind Russell role of Marys treacherous best friend is now a womens magazine editor which means that once youve adjusted to how badly Bening has been lit the film can get sidetracked into one of those awesomely unconvincing inside views of how New York media supposedly work. Meanwhile Ryans Mary reacts to her predicament by experiencing a career-minded awakening (I can be a fashion designer Because I believe in myself) which feels like the sort of thing we watched Diane Keaton go through in bad comedies 20 years ago. Nattering around the edges are Debra Messing as a busybody and walking advertisement for the joys of child rearing Jada Pinkett Smith as a sullen author and Bette Midler as some weird Mae West noodge of a bat-brained divorcee. For added relevance Marys daughter (India Ennenga) has been made into a compendium of up-to-the-minute girl crises. The Women is such an arduous patchwork of ""issues"" it ends up a Frankensteins monster of a chick flick. The movie is a feminist lesson instead of what it should have been (and once was) a tough synthetic high-gloss entertainment that wears its heart on its lacquered fingernails.

Both the 1936 play and the 1939 movie were funny in a bitchy misogynist way. Luce was said to have loathed New York society women and enjoyed ridiculing their fetishes and foibles. Ms. Englishs strongly feminist take on the material divests the comedy of all its humor. Actually Ms. Englishs new version of the 1930s artifact has more in common with the warmly womanly wiles of Sex and the City than with the acid wit of the original version of The Women. Indeed one wonders why Ms. English chose to depict this particular narrative of conjugal love betrayed at least momentarily as almost a tragedy for a woman when divorce is so much more common today on and off the screen than it was 60 years ago. The casting of Meg Ryan in the original Norma Shearer role of the aggrieved wife Mary Haines is not especially outrageous in itself. But whereas Shearers character never worked a day in her life Ms. Ryans character maintains a part-time career as a designer for her fathers clothing store. (This in addition to such perks as a beautiful home in Connecticut an adorable 12-year-old daughter and a Wall Street titan of a husband). Still the biggest change from the original is the casting of Annette Bening as Marys best friend Sylvie Fowler. In that role Rosalind Russell was a scathing delight as a shameless gossip and a farcical provocateur. She is certainly no friend of Marys. Ms. Benings Sylvie unlike her jobless predecessor is the high-powered editor of a celebrity magazine and is forced to betray Mary to save her own job by placating a valued contributor to the magazine. The contributors speciality is all the dirt on Wall Street marriages. Not to worry Mary and Sylvie eventually make up and Mary regains her husband who gets over Eva Mendes Crystal Allen the department stores perfume spritzer girl. Ms. Mendes is too transparently vampish to be as magical as Joan Crawford was in that role in the original. Ms. English has her feminist heart in the right place and she mixes races and sexual predilections to populate Mary and Sylvies circle with possibilities that the lily-white straight damsels of the movie 30s never imagined existed. This contemporary broad-mindedness is admirable but not sufficient to compensate for the lack of comic friction. This is to say that as much as I enjoy current actresses like Ms. Bening and Ms. Ryan even in a lost cause I cannot recommend the latest reenactment of The Women as anything special. asarrisobserver.com Comment Filed under Annette Bening At the Movies Debra Messing Eva Mendes Meg Ryan movie The Women Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2008/arts-culture/bad-makeover,200,thewomen(2008)28,thewomen(2008),observer

A cheating husband a backstabbing best friend and more estrogen than an Emilys List fundraiser may have struck B.O. gold for ""The Women"" back in 1939 but prospects for this pseudo-feisty remake feel iffy at best today. True to the original Diane Englishs 21st-century spin features a strict no-boys policy though she does little to update the material to the modern world. Like being locked in a closet full of cats the old-fashioned all-girl scenario ensures the screen isnt the only place men will be missing. Female interest should be strong but dont expect ""Sex and the City""-size turnouts. English (""Murphy Brown"") has rounded up as diverse a cast as possible as if hoping each actress will snare a different demo. Theres Annette Bening as a Kim Cattrall-style career girl Meg Ryan playing handy housewife to a Wall Street tycoon Debra Messing as a perpetually pregnant baby-maker and Jada Pinkett Smith representing multiple minorities as their Sapphic soul sister. After asking auds to believe in such a mismatched sorority the screenplay bends over backward to keep men out examining their behavior in girls-only habitats from fat farms and garden parties to lingerie stores and lesbian bars. Pic slavishly preserves key plot points from the original however anachronistic they seem in the modern world. It all starts when a blabbermouth manicurist at Saks Fifth Avenue spills the beans that the vixen behind the perfume counter (played by Eva Mendes) has landed a new sugar daddy not realizing the rumor will soon get back to the mans wife Mary Haines (Ryan). In Clare Boothe Luces original play that bit of news catalyzes a storm of backstabbing and one-upswomanship among a close-knit circle of upper-crust dames -- the perfect fodder for biting social satire -- but English isnt out for blood. Here the news brings the group of friends even closer together as they advise Mary on whether she should leave her (unseen) husband or confront the hussy who stole her man. Bening plays Sylvie the editor of struggling beauty magazine Cachet -- essentially a watered-down Miranda Priestly. When one of her assistants pitches an all-revenge issue Sylvie dismisses the idea as outmoded. Indeed this reimagining of ""The Women"" is less about getting even than about inspiring that same mushy sense of female empowerment you might find in a Tyler Perry meller complete with manic mood swings and full-blown diva moments. But even there English struggles trying to create the kind of feel-good experience that seems to come so naturally to femme helmers like Nancy Meyers and Nora Ephron. This isnt one of those instant chick-flick classics that will draw viewers back in every time they come across it channel-surfing. Much of the behavior feels unnatural (theres a funny bit in which Mary binges on a stick of butter after kicking her husband out of the house but other gags simply dont work) and theres just no reconciling the movies preoccupation about Botox and facelifts with the heavily doctored appearances of its leading ladies. Confounding the matter even further is the involvement of Dove an extension of the companys ""Campaign for Real Beauty"" and an example of new horizons in product placement. Sylvie not only uses Dove lotion but also finds it romantic that Marys philandering husband describes his wife as smelling like soap. Messing and Pinkett Smith have very limited screentime; cameo appearances by Candice Bergen Cloris Leachman Carrie Fisher and Bette Midler (as well as newcomer India Ennenga as Marys daughter) get nearly as much play as these two underwritten members of the movies central sisterhood. Ryan and Bening fare better Benings right at home in the skin of a working professional recalling aspects of her perf in ""The American President"" while Ryan exudes much the same no-nonsense charm of her ""When Harry Met Sally"" days. Neither role is a stretch but they play to both actresses strengths. Englishs most significant improvement on the original is her point that a ""breakup"" between best girlfriends sets everybody back even more than any cheating husband could. She also cooks up a far better justification for the movies big fashion show. On the fashion front ""The Women"" delivers from head to toe. Opening montage introduces all the characters by their signature footwear and auds even get two Ryan hairstyles for the price of one (though like the performance both are variations on earlier roles). Music choices arent such a good fit with Mark Ishams jazzy score making this estrogen fest feel a bit frenzied in the spaces between Chris Douridas mostly forgettable pop-tune picks. A signature song wouldve gone a long way to remind auds that these four incredibly different women have a lot more than man trouble in common.
