The flightless birds have hit theaters once again this time in the animated film Happy Feet. This time the penguins arent trekking to their ancestral breeding grounds but singing and dancing their way to the top spot at theaters. DEBBIE ELLIOTT host If March of the Penguins whetted your appetite for more of those little tuxedoed guys from the frozen South you probably already know about the new animated film Happy Feet. Bob Mondello says its positively teeming with penguins and this time theyre not marching; theyre singing and tap-dancing. BOB MONDELLO In a world were meeting the penguin of your dreams requires that you croon a tune all your own little Mumble is at a disadvantage. Other Emperor penguins seem to have no trouble finding their inner song but his attempts but his attempts sound like fingernails on a blackboard. What he can do though from the second hid feet touched the ice is dance. (Soundbite of movie ""Happy Feet"") Mr. ROBIN WILLIAMS (Actor) (As character) What do you make of that? Unidentified Man 1 (Actor) (As character) A little wobbly in the knees huh? Mr. WILLIAMS I dont know. What you doing here boy? Unidentified Child (Actor) (As Mumble) Im happy pop. Mr. WILLIAMS What you doing with your feet? Unidentified Child Theyre happy too. Unidentified Man 1 I wouldnt do that around folks son. Unidentified Child Why not? Unidentified Man 1 Well it just aint penguin okay? Unidentified Child Okay. MONDELLO Conformity being much prized in the emperor penguin community Mumble becomes a bit of an outcast as he grows up among his crooning cousins. Then as a teenager he meets some rockhopper penguins whove hopped from Argentina judging from their accents and who take him under their wing so to speak. (Soundbite of movie ""Happy Feet"") Unidentified Man 2 (Actor) (As character) All you gotta do is sing. Mr. ELIJAH WOOD (As Mumble) Thats the problem. I cant. Unidentified Man 2 You a bird aint you? Mr. WOOD All birds can sing. Unidentified Man 2 I shall sing like the birdies do tweet tweet tweet tweet tweet. Mr. WOOD All right (Singing) (unintelligible) Unidentified Man 2 Whats he doing? Mr. WOOD (Singing) (unintelligible) Unidentified Man 3 (Actor) (As character) I think hes singing. Unidentified Man 2 He not singing. Thats not singing. (Soundbite of screaming) Mr. WILLIAMS (As character) Yeah I heard an animal once do that but then they rolled him over. He was dead. Mr. WOOD Yeah. MONDELLO Happy Feet is directed by George Miller who started out making Mel Gibsons Mad Max movies and who later made the kid flick Babe. You could say hes eased into computer animation from the real world which may be why this movie is so visually breathtaking. Camera crews spent two years finding towering glaciers and craggy Antarctic mountains that they could mesh with their amazingly lifelike animated penguins using a technique called motion capture the one used to make that Christmas movie The Polar Express. There it made the world look like a storybook. Here it places a storybook fable in a persuasively real world just one populated by penguins who can tap dance like Savion Glover. (Soundbite of movie ""Happy Feet"") MONDELLO And who sound like Elijah Wood Robin Williams and a lot of terrific singers. (Soundbite of movie ""Happy Feet"") MONDELLO The camera moves far more than it does in most animated films swooping around thousands of Mumbles penguin buddies as they plunge off cliffs and get chased by predators then backing up until the whole penguin tribe is just a little speck on the horizon. Things are so lifelike in fact that when our heros grown up the story takes a lifelike turn from the just be your kooky little self plotline to one about aliens who are over-fishing tossing away dangerous plastic and even putting penguins in zoos. Thisll be a bit much for the tots in the audience and may cause some eye-rolling among adults too but happily for Happy Feet the serious stuff is just as seriously pretty as the rest of a film that is tuneful and funny and sometimes both. Im Bob Mondello. (Soundbite of movie ""Happy Feet"") Unidentified Man 4 (Actor) (As character) Whats wrong with you? Unidentified Woman (Actor) (As character) Mumble? Mr. WOOD Yeah. Unidentified Woman Its better you just... Mr. WOOD Yeah I know. Unidentified Woman ...you listen. You know? Mr. WOOD Yeah. Sorry. Unidentified Woman Okay. Mr. WOOD Sorry. Unidentified Woman Chill. Mr. WOOD Youre great. That was great. Copyright (c) 2006 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review They Cut Glass. And Hands. For such a formulaic film Blood Diamond does have one very nice surprise. (Plus Leos good in it.) By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis (Photo Brigitte Lacombe ) It will be fun to see which stars are willful and/or clueless enough to wear diamonds to this years Academy Awards if the political action melodrama Blood Diamondabout the carnage surrounding the mining of the gemstones in Sierra Leoneracks up a lot of nominations. Forgive me for opening on such a superficial note but the truest measure of the worth of the moviewhich is both excitingly well made and dispiritingly formulaicwill be in what trickles down whether strong box office plus Leonardo DiCaprios earnest proclamations on Oprah plus the opportunistic shame of Hollywood goddesses can disrupt Tad and Suzys engagement-ring expedition and Dads anniversary surprise for Mom. People back home wouldnt buy a diamond if they knew it cost someone a hand avers the films crusading journalist (Jennifer Connelly) and the director Edward Zwick is not above supplying the people back home with a close-up of that hand getting whacked off by a machete. Zwick is now something of a biracial political-conversion melodrama specialist having presided over the much weirder The Last Samuraiin which the guilt-racked Indian slayer Tom Cruise was dispatched to Japan to wipe out another indigenous culture but found instead his Inner Buddha. In Blood Diamond the sinner ripe for enlightenment is Danny Archer (DiCaprio) a native of Zimbabwe who makes a point of referring to the country by its old colonial name Rhodesia. A former Angolan mercenary Danny now (the film is set in the late nineties) smuggles Sierra Leone diamonds into Liberia in return for guns and rocket-launchers which go to the rebel army (the RUF)the army weve seen mowing down women and children training young boys to be rapists and mass murderers and conscripting hardier men to work in the diamond fields. One of these conscriptees is the Mende fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who findsand manages to hidea whopper of a diamond before somehow (dont ask) landing in jail across from Danny who somehow (dont ask) gets wind of the potential mother lode. The rest of Blood Diamond centers on the odyssey of these two very different Africans the sleazy white man desperate for a big score to square his debts with a mercenary colonel (Arnold Vosloo who speaks with the clipped cadences of Christopher Lees Count Dracula) and the Solomonic black man determined to find his teenage son (Caruso Kuypers) before a sadistic RUF captain (David Harewood) with an eye patch turns him into a mindless raping and pillaging machine. Zwick and his screenwriter Charles Leavitt are conscientious about stamping out the mismatched-buddy-movie fires when they flare up. They keep Danny a cad and Solomon resentful over his countrys long history of exploitation for its natural resources. Connellys Maddy Bowen comes along to pump Danny for the details of his smuggling operation and just as important in the scheme of things the source of his hurtanything to combat his self-serving fatalism. Given that the movie doesnt have a single narrative surpriseyou always know where its going and why commercially speaking its going thereits amazing how good Blood Diamond is. I guess thats the surprise. Amid the predictable picturesque sunrises and sunsets are some extraordinary chases through tropical forests with huge radiantly green leaves (the cinematographer is Eduardo Serra); the misery in the shantytowns and refugees camps is tactile; and the scenes in which the RUF captain works to purge Solomons son of his humanity are chilling. Hounsou is a bit totemic for my taste but the moments in which he rages at the loss of his son have a preternatural power and Connelly is such a smart sane unhistrionic actress that she almost disguises the fact that her character is a wheeze. Its DiCaprios movie though. More and more were getting the measure of him When he plays earnest male ingenues as in The Beach Gangs of New York and The Departed his face looks heavy and slack and there doesnt seem to be much going on behind that big brow. But when hes cock of the walk hes a star. His Danny is in the mode of his characters in Titanic and Catch Me If You Cana wiry resourceful con artist whos most fully alive when hes backed into corners and must invent a way out. His lightness here keeps Blood Diamond from getting weighed down by the horror of its subject. Whether it should be weighed downthats another matter. As I watched the senseless brutality the shooting of mothers and children as they fled I was torn up divided. I thought Why do I need to see this? Then I thought This happened in Sierra Leone and is still happening in parts of AfricaI need to see it. Then I thought If I need to see it I need to see more than a sneering villain with an eye patch. I need to understand how this manand the people under himbecome the monsters they are. Thats what you dont get in Blood Diamond what you dont get in even the best melodrama insight. After we stop buying blood diamonds from conflict zones what then? 1 2 Next Share this story...

First and foremost it asks us to accept yet another actor as James Bond. Daniel Craig isnt merely acceptable but formidable. His Bond is at least the equal of the best ones before him and beats all of them in sheer intensity. The English star (he became one as soon as the movie opened) makes physicality exciting emotional detachment interesting -- his Bond starts out as a stone killer -- and stirrings of tenderness affecting. Wall Street Journal Video Dow Jones Onlines Ed Crane offers a preview of ""Casino Royale"" including scenes of Daniel Craig doing his own stunts backstage interviews and more. This latest edition of the franchise directed by Martin Campbell asks to be seen as a prequel. In the fashion of ""Batman Begins"" it goes back to Ian Flemings first novel to discover who James Bond was before he became the debonair -- and ultimately self-parodying -- womanizer adventurer and mixologist of the 20 previous films. The scheme is ambitious and the psychologizing pays off with surprising clarity. We see a ""blunt instrument"" as his superior M describes him an angry candidate for lifelong thugdom grow into a fearless yet sensitive operative who is willing at least once to shed the armor that protects his heart. ENLARGE But the production also wants to wow us as a sequel a thoroughly modern James Bond epic that drops many of the franchises shopworn trademarks -- the hot Bond girls the lurid villains the exuberant technology -- in favor of startlingly violent action serial brutality a chilling interlude of torture and a struggle against shadowy international terrorists. Its The Spy Who Came In From the Warmth. The calculation is surely a shrewd one for contemporary audiences addicted to mayhem. Still a venerable Fleming plot from an earlier time has been epoxied -- Bonded -- to a new era with mixed results. Anachronism abounds. Though James is younger M is played once again by the not-younger Judi Dench (whos terrific as always so what the hell). The villains of yore have given way to a cipher named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). Hes a banker who channels money to the worlds terrorists and who exudes little more than mournful menace. The movie is much too long and not just because of several endings one of which is literally breathtaking. The extended confrontation at its center -- a high-stakes poker game in which Bond must beat Le Chiffre to defeat the terrorist network -- slows the pace and trivializes the present reality of terrorism If only al Qaeda could be done in by a full house. The films a fantasy but one that touches willy-nilly on a real-world threat of unavoidable immediacy. The plot of Flemings 1953 novel rang gratifyingly false because the bad guys were members of SMERSH. More than half a century later the terrorists of ""Casino Royale"" are neither SMERSHies nor radical Islamists but nobodies with no distinguishing characteristics or ideologies. While that may facilitate the movies global marketing it does diminish the drama. What deepens the drama is the relationship -- yes a genuine and quite complex relationship -- between Bond and Vesper Lynd a lissome mostly cool British Treasury official played superbly by Eva Green. Vesper has been assigned to deliver Bonds poker stake and to make sure he plays his hands responsibly. For a while things go badly between them -- and for us; their comparison of crippled childhoods is awfully glib. But Vesper an emotional chameleon holds the hand that will win Bonds love and make him the man he had already in those 20 iterations come to be. Now thats complexity. Bobby Emilio Estevezs ""Bobby"" tests your patience to the breaking point -- maybe beyond. Its a fictional account of 24 lives in the 24 hours leading up to the 1968 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles at the Ambassador Hotel. Most of the characters work at the hotel or are involved in the Kennedy campaign and all of the action is set in and around the hotel though action is a kind word for the belabored chitchat revealed trivia and narrative thumb-twiddling that threatens to turn the story such as it is into a low-rent ""Grand Hotel."" Slowly if unsurely though the film finds its focus and purpose -- an evocation of the late 1960s in tumultuous detail and a stirring reminder of how idealism can galvanize politics and people. ENLARGE Laurence Fishburne and Freddy Rodriguez in Bobby Is a liberal agenda at play here? Of course ""Bobby"" casts its fallen hero without apology as all but a martyred saint. And without asking questions let alone venturing answers about contradictions in his personality or what kind of president he might have made if he had lived. (Apart from one fleeting glimpse of a look-alike sweeping into the hotel lobby we see Robert Kennedy only in newsreel and TV footage.) But Mr. Estevez keeps his sympathies in full sight -- at least he does so once his omnibus film lumbers beyond some non-partisan -- and non-interesting -- detours. I thought wed never hear the end of intimate conversations in the Ambassadors kitchen lobby and rooms. The problem is not that the conversations are pointless. If anything theyre too obviously designed to point up the issues of the time -- among them racism Vietnam the inequities of the draft and the awful impact of Martin Luther Kings assassination. Whats more they take so much screen time that Robert Kennedys impending assassination threatens to become a mere pretext for assorted riffs on the zeitgeist. Yet some of those riffs are astutely observed and extremely well-written. Most of them benefit from the excellent work of an ensemble cast. (I particularly admired Laurence Fishburne and Freddy Rodriguez.) And the drama gets a sudden charge when Kennedy arrives at the hotel. Its amazing how everything starts to change at the very moment of his arrival even though we know were watching a stand-in. For those of us who remember that terrible year its more amazing that we still have so few defenses against the horror of the event and the death of such bright promise. Iraq in Fragments James Longleys ""Iraq In Fragments"" a documentary of stunning immediacy and marvelous images is worth more than whole channels of calamity-cam footage -- the kind of reporting that dutifully records the aftermath of deadly firefights and suicide bombings but excludes any sense of the nations daily life. Mr. Longley has no solutions to peddle or axes to grind. Hes less concerned with The Street than with teeming streets colorful alleys where Iraqis live and work and schools where kids struggle to learn in the midst of chaos. The fragments of the title are clearly a reference to that chaos but they also bespeak the films three-part structure. Each of those parts is a story unto itself with discoveries of the sort that rarely grace nightly TV. Happy Feet Imagine Fred Astaire in white tie and tails. Now subtract Fred Astaire add a penguins head and pedal extremities to the spiffy suit throw in a supporting penguin cast of indistinguishable but far from unflappable thousands give them a glacier to dance on and youve got the beginnings of ""Happy Feet."" But only the beginnings because the essence of this inventive though erratic animated feature is joyous music and eye-popping motion. The film which was directed by George Miller celebrates differentness without being cloying about it. Mumble a young Emperor penguin cant sing as Emperors are supposed to but hes a born tap dancer. His gift gets him exiled from the ice shelf and earns him accusations of backsliding when he returns to his gotta-dance ways. (This from a community of frontsliders.) The voice cast includes Elijah Wood Nicole Kidman Hugh Jackman and Robin Williams. ""Happy Feet"" is the kind of musical comedy that might have swept the world if MGM had been based in Antarctica instead of Culver City. For Your Consideration If youve rejoiced as I have in Christopher Guests mockumentaries - such priceless zircons as ""Waiting For Guffman"" and ""Best Of Show"" -- youd best lower your expectations of ""For Your Consideration."" For one thing its not a mockumentary but a semi-dramatized send-up of fatuous actors whove been led to believe they may be giving Oscar-worthy performances in a movie called ""Home For Purim."" While that title raises expectations for delicious humor what we see of the movie itself is foolish and flat. ""For Your Consideration"" opens promisingly on the wonderful Catherine OHara as an over-the-hill actress watching Bette Davis in ""Jezebel"" and mouthing her lines with as much awe as delight. But in a film that features among others Eugene Levy Michael McKean Parker Posey and Harry Shearer Ms. OHara like almost everyone else falls victim to a prevailing tone thats short on wit and long on self-congratulation. DVD TIP ""Layer Cake"" (2004) wasnt Daniel Craigs first feature film but it was the first to show how commanding his presence could be in a dark and violent milieu. He plays a British drug dealer known as XXXX who drops his plans for early retirement in favor of one last and very big deal. Matthew Vaughn directed from a remarkably intricate script by J.J. Connolly.

Turns out they dance too. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Happy Feet Animated feature. Voiced by Elijah Wood Nicole Kidman Hugh Jackman Robin Williams and Brittany Murphy. (PG. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Watching those determined penguins march across Antarctica in a certain Oscar-winning documentary anyone could see they got rhythm. The exuberant animated feature ""Happy Feet"" goes one step further -- creating an aquatic bird thats born to dance. Wiggling free of the egg that hatched him baby Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood) sets his tiny webbed feet on the ice and instinctively begins to tap. Australian director George Miller who had pigs all but fly in ""Babe"" makes another imaginative leap. He stared hard at penguins -- with their upright stance supported by legs set far back on their bodies and coloration that looks like formal wear -- and saw natural hoofers. All thats missing is a top hat and cane. Miller and a team of imaginative animators have created the first musical of the holiday season a ""Dreamgirls"" for the young set against a backdrop of the frozen Antarctic so realistic it could be a National Geographic documentary. Using motion capture -- a technique for digitally recording movements -- they copied the tapping of dance virtuoso Savion Glover. His feet stand in for Mumbles kicking up a flurry of snowflakes. The conceit of ""Happy Feet"" is that Mumble is the tone-deaf scion of a flock whose common genetic trait is the ability to belt out a song. When these Emperor penguins open their spine-lined mouths it is not merely to devour fish. Their impressive repertoire ranges from pop music to disco rap gospel and even opera. Its a mating thing -- a male and female of the species are matched up through a so-called heartsong. The movie opens on a high note with the story of how Mumbles parents Memphis and Norma Jean met through this ritual. Memphis struts out on the ice crooning ""I feel so lonely I could die."" Because Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman who lend their voices to the couple really can sing when Memphis bittersweet solo turns into a romantic duet the pleasure is all ours. (The slyness of the script extends to names. Memphis is an obvious play on Elvis which some kiddies may get. But Norma Jean is an in-joke for their parents an apparent reference to Marilyn Monroe that Kidman reinforces with her breathy delivery.) ""Happy Feet"" skates along quite nicely as long as it remains focused on Mumbles genetic shortcoming. Children who often feel like outsiders will identify with his hurt at being an outcast laughed at every time he attempts to sing and that what comes out sounds like a broken muffler. Mumbles extraordinary talent goes unappreciated because its different from everyone elses. His parents are concerned that without his own heartsong hell never attract anyone or have an egg of his own to incubate although his childhood chum Gloria (a sprightly sounding Brittany Murphy) seems to like Mumble just the way he is. Theres a hilarious bit swiped from ""Singin in the Rain"" (another reference only adults are likely to get) where Mumble tries to fool the flock by mouthing the words to a song while a penguin ally crouches down behind him and does the actual crooning. But Miller and his co-writers try to jam in too much story and too many biblical references for young minds to absorb. When the fish Mumbles tribe relies on for sustenance mysteriously disappear causing a famine a community elder blames Mumble. Eventually the poor little guy is cast out into the wilderness. Although his adventures with seals and whales make for gloriously animated ocean scenes theyre also kind of scary. Just in the nick of time Robin Williams appears to supply some much needed humor -- is there anyone better at funny voices? -- doing double duty as a penguin with a Latino accent who is in awe of Mumbles dance moves and as a kind of Wizard of Oz whom Mumble is sent to in hope of finding out where all the fish really have gone. The movie is on thin ice providing an answer to that question. The villain turns out to be commercial marine harvesting. Dont little ones have enough to worry about without ecological concerns popping up in family entertainment? ""Happy Feet"" should have stayed light on its feet. -- Advisory Mild scenes of penguins in peril.

Unlike the other Emperor penguins Mumbles (voiced by Elijah Wood) finds music in his tapping feet and not his beak in Happy Feet. Photo Warner Bros. Pictures Happy Feet 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Wait a minute -- happy feet cant cause a famine"" Such wisdom and pluck are the mark of a hero and a hero it is who inspires the masses in Happy Feet. To be sure he is a flightless bird but whoever said a leading man needs grace? Or looks? Or functional wings? All he needs is two clawed feet and a feel for Stevie Wonder. Audiences who awwwed and ahhhed at March of the Penguins would do well to forget about it because this bustling animated feature is far removed from the documentarian pathos of last years sleeper hit. It crosses some of the same Antarctic breeding grounds and aquatic terrors (those leopard seals) but only to spur things along for its happy-footed rebel Mumble (Elijah Wood). The films main racket is making Mumble tap like Savion Glover if you can picture Savion Glover as 3 feet tall and feathered. (You neednt. Glovers dance routines were computer-morphed into Mumbles). Mumble is an emperor penguin with an inborn deficiency He cant sing and cant therefore lure a mate. His dancing doesnt much impress his fellow penguins who look askance at funky soft-shoe and suspect -- this is where the fearmongering comes in -- said activity might have angered the all-hallowed penguin goddess in charge of (among other things) fish. ""It just aint penguin OK?"" says Mumbles pa voiced by Hugh Jackman with a not-too-shabby Southern accent. But Mumbles got rhythm. Mumbles got to dance. Mumble suspects the real culprits are large ""aliens"" with ""front-facing eyes"" and weirdo appendages in whose pursuit he heads across the brilliant polar icescape. This pursuit involves a few Robin Williams characters including a Barry White-loving penguin with a mystical sideline and an Adelie penguin with a ridiculous Latino accent and four cocky friends. Happy Feet was directed by George Miller of Mad Max fame in his first feature effort since 1998s Babe Pig in the City -- and it is wise while watching it not to dwell too much on plot. It twists off in one or two or maybe three too many directions incorporating one or two or maybe three too many ideas and moods. Its a comedy; a romance; a noble quest; a rebuke of religious fundamentalism; an embrace of independent thinking; an eco-minded warning on avian habitats. Incongruously human actors appear near the movies close part of a whimsical environmental message that equates salvation with hoofing it If only wildlife could tap dance we might preserve their habitats. But Happy Feet is not devoid of downy magic. The animation dazzles. The baby birds are fluffy darlings. The script has its moments the dance bits are a blast and Mumbles love interest Gloria (Brittany Murphy) gets to belt out a verse or two of Queen. The all-star voice cast also features Nicole Kidman doing a spot-on Marilyn Monroe impression as Mumbles breathy mum Norma Jean. Besides any film that pitches dance as a metaphor for redemption has inherent social value.

During the harsh winter when the female folk are away bringing home the krill the fellas sit atop the eggs. Those familiar with the documentary ""March of the Penguins"" know that when Memphis (Hugh Jackman) lets his slip into the snow it is a desperate moment. Come warmer weather the egg might not crack. It does but the downy ball of fluff is born with a hatchling defect He cant stop moving his webbed feet. That would be weird enough. But worse Memphis and Norma Jeans boy Mumble cant carry a tune. Director and co-writer George Miller - the man who brought us Mad Max but also Babe ""the talking pig"" - uses this tale of Mumbles difference and his gift to craft a sweet if incomplete lesson about conformity individuality and community. As the emperor penguins work their high notes ""Happy Feet"" resembles ""Antarctica Idol."" Only there is a lot more at stake than the approval of an odd triumvirate of judges. The emperor penguins ""heartsong"" is its call for a mate. The movie begins with Mumbles parents heartsong courting. And if Nicole Kidman sounds like Marilyn Monroe in ""Some Like It Hot"" that likely is intentional. After all her name is Norma Jean. Brittany Murphy plays Mumbles potential song-and-dance partner Gloria. The pontificating Noah the Elder reminds his penguin huddles in a foggy brogue - delivered by Hugo Weaving - that the name of that tune is survival. Tap dance phenom Savion Glover provides the paddle and rolls the digs stomps and claps that make Mumble such a talented oddball. E.G. Daily who won us over as the voice of Millers wonder pig provides the voice for baby Mumble. Elijah Wood gives earnest voice to the older Mumble. With the growing number of studio animation units its interesting to see what tricks filmmakers ply to please the chaperones of their tiny-tot audience. ""Happy Feet"" smartly shifts much of the winks and innuendo of adult chatter onto a soundtrack heavy with familiar pop tunes - for instance the slightly bawdy ""Lets Talk About Sex."" Instead Robin Williams provides the nonstop scatting that gives ""Happy Feet"" its zestiest pleasures. When Mumble leaves the community - because leave he must - he meets up with a wisecracking crew of Adelie penguins from very south of the border. Williams plays Ramon the most talkative of the Adelie Amigos. He also plays the sanctifying preach-it-penguin-preach Lovelace. Its easy to applaud - easier still to enjoy - ""Happy Feets"" diversity. But one wonders if Williams isnt committing a sort of vocal version of a minstrel show When hes not playing an amigo hes doing a black church version of the accidental guru the Adelies come to with their questions. If ever you tire of the fauna the animators have created awesome blue-and-white ice vistas and beckoning waterways. When the penguin chicks take their first dive into that deep blue their streaks look like contrails. When ""Happy Feet"" isnt being pretty darn fun its just plain pretty.

"Happy Feet An animated spectacle that goes with the floe - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Happy Feet An animated spectacle that goes with the floe By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 17 2006 What do you get when you cross ""March of the Penguins"" Disneys ""High School Musical"" ""The Ugly Duckling"" a runaway jukebox ""Footloose"" Joseph Campbell ""Riverdance"" a Greenpeace board meeting and five hits of prime Woodstock-era brown acid? You get ""Happy Feet"" the new computer-animated family film that is quite simply the most bizarre thing under the Antarctic sun. Is it any good? Im still figuring that out.The posters and trailers are selling the movie as a feel-good comedy for the toddler set. Its not. While the youngest audiences will be charmed by the opening scenes of Emperor Penguins singing high-voltage renditions of baby boomer hits and theyll coo with delight at the adorable lil fuzzballs that subsequently hatch ""Happy Feet"" takes a turn for the seriously intense after that. The penguins meet the enemy and in the words of Pogo he is us.One of those fuzzballs is named Mumble (voiced by ""Rugrats"" regular E.G. Daily as a baby and by Elijah Wood as a barely molted adult). While his young peers are instructed that they each have to find their own personal ""heartsong"" -- all of which come straight from oldies radio -- Mumble can muster only a squawk. Instead hes a born tap - dance artiste the Savion Glover of the ice shelf (in fact its Glovers motion-captured feet and moves were seeing) and when he gets his groove on the other hatchlings thunderingly join in.Unamused the grown-up birds boot Mumble out of the pack. Journeying into exile he joins up with a group of nattering Adelie penguins  led by one with the voice of Robin Williams. Inexplicably these guys all talk with Hispanic accents and Williams also plays a blustering overweight Rockhopper penguin with a gospel croon. Hes having fun and the kids will too but this second-banana Speedy Gonzalez stuff feels moldy and embarrassing -- the Hollywood equivalent of racial profiling.Besides any reasonably sentient adult may already be in a coma from the films full-throttle kitsch. The notion of CGI penguins performing a mating dance while singing a Las Vegas version of Princes ""Kiss"" is not easy to get ones brain around. Mumbles father (Hugh Jackman) is an Elvis dude whose heartsong is ""Heartbreak Hotel"" his mama (Nicole Kidman) a Marilyn Monroe birdie down to the mole. When she leaves dad sitting on the egg he whispers ""Goodbye Norma Jean"" the penguin chorus kicks into ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" and your jaw hits the floor.At the same time youre registering that ""Happy Feet"" is one of the most visually ravishing CGI films yet rendered. The young penguins first foray into the ocean is a remarkable underwater ballet part Busby Berkeley  part Blue Angels; the animators  use of light and color fits the end-of-the-world majesty of the setting. The movies an uncategorizable mixture of the tacky and profound and on some weird level you have to respect it.To its credit too ""Happy Feet"" understands that nature is red in beak and fang. There are attacks on Mumble and his pals by skua  seal and killer whale all of whom mean business; the seal especially is a slavering carnivore purged of all cuteness. Five- year- olds with delicate constitutions will cower under the seats while their hardier siblings will shriek with excitement and save the nightmares for later.More to the point ""Happy Feet"" sees the animals at the top of the food chain -- thats you and me -- as capable of the most long-term damage and it sends its hero trudging across the tundra on a journey of mythic impact to right the matter. Even without the regular camera pullbacks to view the earth as a small cosmic marble the movies vantage point is planetary.But its a comedy too and often a funny one -- and a musical that spills over with demented exuberance. Whos responsible for this mash-up? George Miller the Australian creator of the ""Mad Max"" movies the writer and producer of ""Babe"" and (heres the relevant item) the director of the edgy discomfiting ""Babe Pig in the City.""Like that film ""Happy Feet"" dives into the darkness with overstuffed brio and it delivers as much wonder as dissonance. Without giving too much away theres a key sequence in a big city aquarium thats almost primordially powerful not least because of the ghostly preoccupied bipeds on the other side of the glass.What can get these odd creatures to focus on the havoc theyre wreaking? A tap-dancing penguin? A movie about a tap-dancing penguin? Or do we crave only momentary diversion before moving on? At its best and at its worst -- and after a while its hard to tell the difference -- ""Happy Feet"" seems hellbent on diverting us into action.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Happy Feet | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; happy-feet ) Happy Feet (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Happy Feet is a weird movie. No one can accuse director George Miller and his co-writers of playing it safe but there are some genres - such as family-friendly animation - where adherence to conventions can be viewed as a positive trait. 75 minutes into the 105-minute movie I thought I was watching the first great animated film since The Incredibles. The final half-hour disabused me of that notion. Taken in total Happy Feet contains enough solid entertainment to be worth the price of admission but the productions last act self-inflicted wounds do irreparable damage to what is an otherwise fine motion picture. Happy Feet the first of a wave of new animated movies starring the tuxedoed birds takes us to the playground of the penguins Antarctica. There reenacting a sequence from March of the Penguins the mothers go off fishing while the fathers stay behind and warm the eggs. When the fishing expedition if over Norma Jean (voice of Nicole Kidman) returns home to her hubby Memphis (Hugh Jackman). She then meets her baby boy Mumble (Elijah Wood) whos a little abnormal. Instead of singing like most Emperor penguins he dances. To exacerbate matters when he tries to croon the noise that emerges sounds like the death cry of some horribly injured creature. Convinced he has no chance to win the love of Gloria (Brittany Murphy) he leaves the conclave of the emperor penguins and hooks up with Ramon (Robin Williams) and his crew. They belong to a different species and are more open to Mumbles ""happy feet."" Soon accompanied by his new friends he sets off to solve the mystery of why the supply of fish has dried up threatening to starve the penguins. The first 2/3 of Happy Feet is standard animated stuff presented with lots of energy and verve. The penguins are cute (especially the chicks) and presented with enough photo-realism that they could at times be mistaken for their March of the Penguins counterparts. The musical numbers are lively although some of the song choices are odd. (The big showstopping numbers are ""Kiss"" and ""Boogie Wonderland."") Robin Williams Brittany Murphy Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman do their own singing. Where Happy Feet soars is in the inventiveness of the camera work. No previous animated film has done as much with the vantage point as this one keeping things kinetic as it soars in for close-ups and zooms out for panoramic shots. There are first person action shots that zip through ice tunnels and down steep embankments. In large part because of the innovative way in which Miller has shot Happy Feet its always interesting to observe and often exhilarating to experience. Its impossible to discuss Happy Feet without confronting the ending. The movie provides the feeling that the screenwriters having written themselves into a corner could only resolve the situation by employing a deus ex machina. While one could argue thats not a big deal in an animated movie the way its used here feels false even within the context of a story about talking penguins. The writing during the last half-hour is sloppy and borderline incoherent with grating transitions and unpleasant tone shifts. The inclusion of non-animated (live action) human beings is jarring. Happy Feet also offers a strong pro-conservation message - not a bad thing had it been handled better. As it is it is presented with the subtlety of unanesthetized hammer-and-tongs dental work - dumped on viewers with a few moments strident preaching. Oddly its so perfunctory that kids probably wont notice or if they do they will quickly forget. The way to get children to care about issues presented in animated films is to embed them in the subtext throughout the narrative not do a core dump over a two-minute span at the climax. The films director is George Miller who knows a thing or two about action and family oriented motion pictures. Miller was the driving force behind the popular 1990s features Babe (which he co-wrote and produced) and Babe Pig in the City (which he directed co-wrote and produced). Earlier in his career he helped launch Mel Gibsons career by with the Mad Max trilogy Mad Max The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. For Happy Feet Miller incorporates decades of experience. His movie runs on high octane and has widespread appeal. Happy Feet ends on an upbeat note with singing and dancing but the weaknesses that precede it deflate the euphoria. Its fair to note that many of the elements that bothered me about the film arent going to be noticed by the under-10 target audience and there are plenty of things sprinkled throughout for adults to enjoy. As usual Robin Williams adds spontaneity and humor to the proceedings (including at least one line that had me laughing out loud). Because of the camerawork the action sequences are not as pedestrian as is often the case in animated features. And the visuals are a cut above what we have been seeing in recent rushed-to-the-screen productions. The ingredients for greatness are there. Its too bad the movie lost its way on the approach to the finish line. I recommend Happy Feet but not as enthusiastically as I wish I could.

Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood) tries to sing his ""heart song"" in ""Happy Feet."" By Christy Lemire updated 11/13/2006 81251 PM ET 2006-11-14T011251 Print Font + - REVIEW Like the classic animated Disney movies from decades ago -- ""Bambi"" for example or ""Dumbo"" -- ""Happy Feet"" isnt afraid to get a little serious a little dark. It isnt afraid to mix in some substance with its style. Thats also precisely what makes it so different from the inordinately large number of computer-animated movies that have come storming into theaters this year despite the fact that superficially it may look so similar. Youve got your all-star voice cast (Elijah Wood Nicole Kidman Robin Williams Hugh Jackman) your soundtrack thats chock full of pop tunes (Prince Beach Boys Stevie Wonder) and of course your talking animals. This time theyre penguins -- and theyre cute. Very very cute. Irresistible actually just as they proved to be in the Oscar-winning documentary ""March of the Penguins."" (Youll see several images in ""Happy Feet"" that also appeared in that film though as director and co-writer George Miller points out his movie was in the works long before ""March of the Penguins"" came out.) Miller and a team of writers and artists vividly bring to life the penguins mating process in Antarctica the choosing of a partner; the laying of an egg; the long agonizing stretch in which the father protects it from blizzard conditions; and the eventual return of the mother with food for the hatchling. The visuals can be both intimate and breathtakingly grand. The filmmakers sent two research crews to the Antarctic to capture lighting textures and landscape details to recreate them realistically in their computers; the results are dazzling unbelievably tactile. All that work though supports a story that has real meaning that can be deeply poignant and isnt just a nonstop madcap frenzy of color noise and cutesy pop-culture references. This should come as no surprise from Miller a three-time Oscar nominee who co-wrote and produced the modern classic ""Babe."" Young Mumble (Wood) is a little different from the rest of the penguins the result of being briefly exposed to the elements while he was still in his shell. Hes incapable of belting out his own unique song something inside every penguin and something his parents both unquestionably possess His father Memphis (Jackman) is an Elvis sound-alike; his mother Norma Jean (Kidman) has that sexy breathy Marilyn Monroe thing going. The one talent hes had since day one his dancing ability is deemed weird among the other penguins. Even Gloria (Brittany Murphy) his one friend from childhood who happens to have the best singing voice of all has trouble completely accepting him. So the goodhearted Mumble is nonetheless a total outcast -- though he should be the most popular guy on the iceberg with Savion Glover providing his tap moves behind the scenes through stop-motion animation. Advertise Advertise Advertise Once the fish supply becomes sparse Mumble begins to think some outside force is to blame but the elders (led by a crotchety old man voiced by Hugo Weaving) wont listen and ultimately use his outspokenness as an excuse to exile him for good. Hes not alone for long. Mumble quickly meets a bunch of Latino penguins who are wowed by his dance moves and want to hang out with him. They think hes cool. And with his new amigos led by the cocky Ramon (Williams a voiceover veteran whos finally honed his seemingly boundless energy) hes happy and confident for the first time in his young life. But hes still curious to find out whats happened to all the fish and he becomes even more suspicious after visiting Lovelace the guru (Williams again) a soulful wild-feathered penguin who provides only cryptic answers to his many questions. ""Happy Feet"" follows Mumble on a journey of discovery of himself and the world which can be both harrowing and thrilling. A scene in which he and his new pals go barreling down a steep snowy slope on their bellies is a wonder of timing and choreography as is a run-in with a couple of killer whales. (The late Steve Irwin provides the voice of an elephant seal who helps point Mumble in the right direction.) ""Happy Feet"" feels more filmic that most animated offerings with its long shots and less frantic pace a refreshing change for adults. Kids will still love it though and many were dancing at their seats during a recent screening. (They dont call it ""Happy Feet"" for nothing.) Everything wraps up a bit too neatly at the end and the eco-friendly message may seem too pat. These are small things to forgive in what is otherwise easily the best animated film of the year.

Viewers weary of the increasing similarity of most animated films have a tonic at hand in ""Happy Feet."" Likely to be affectionately dubbed ""March of the Penguins The Musical"" George Millers long-in-the-works dive into full-blown computer animation drapes a relatively conventional story about a young penguins struggles over being ""different"" in striking visuals invigorating songs and lively characterizations. Although the film might prove a bit too different for a minority of parents general reaction is likely figures to be one of jaw-dropping amazement sparking merry B.O. through the holidays and further abundance in home entertainment incarnations. Extensive simultaneous Imax engagements will be particularly popular. There is no mistaking ""Happy Feet"" as anything but the work of a real filmmaker; in terms of composition camera movement and editing the pic is conceived as a ""real"" movie and emerges as one of the very best directed animated films on record. Not surprisingly from the force behind the ""Babe"" movies the attention to detail is phenomenal the humor ample. But the story is inescapably serious on both personal and societal levels. While countless moppet-targeted films have taught the lesson that the oddball shall prevail and that everyone is gifted in a particular way looming over everything here is the specter of aliens -- human beings that is -- who leave ominous traces of their comings and goings on the icy wastes of Antarctica and impinge upon the penguins supply of fish. The environmental themes are familiar but Miller superbly manifests the threat in a manner both tactile and hauntingly poetic. Fine while up and flying pic has trouble with both takeoff and landing. Intro of emperor penguin society consists of a virtual assault of mostly soulful Ramp;B tunes. Initial seg in fact reps a recapitulation of ""March of the Penguins"" as the moms lay eggs hand them off to the dads and head off for distant feeding waters while the males face the bitter months-long night of incubation. Conformity reigns as this communitys highest value with strict compliance enforced by wizened elders wonderfully craggy figures who look like they were chiseled by Rodin. Its expected emperor penguins will have beautiful voices. Newborn tyke Mumble cant put two notes together but the little bugger sure can dance; hes born tapping with speed and moves the equal of tapmaster Savion Glover who provided the motion-capture terpsing for the furry bird. Mumbles mom (voiced by Nicole Kidman) doesnt mind her sons eccentricity but his dad (Hugh Jackman) complains that ""it just aint penguin."" Despite the great song-and-dance potential exhibited by Mumble (voiced after infancy by Elijah Wood) and his dazzlingly voiced pal Gloria (Brittany Murphy) Mumble is eventually exiled by the high priest (Hugo Weaving). And so begin Mumbles wanderings riddled with unknown dangers. In the first and most child-frightening of three big-action set pieces each more dazzling than the last Mumble is attacked by an unusually toothsome seal only to be taken under the wing of a bunch of small Mexican-accented penguins fronted by Ramon (Robin Williams). Mumble is embraced as ""Big Guy"" and begins to see theres more to the world than the rigid realm of Emperor Land. In another fantastic action scene Mumble and his five buddies go careening like so many live toboggans down a vast run of slopes and bowls and cliffs at breathtaking speed until they are caught up short by the sight of an alien visitation. The band of wayfarers enlarges again with the addition of rockhopper penguin Lovelace (Williams again in soulful mode) a self-styled guru. The odyssey briefly reunites Mumble who retains his immature gray feathers throughout with Gloria and his emperor brethren. But with food in diminished supply Mumble sets out for the Forbidden Shore where elephant seals (including one voiced by the late Steve Irwin) warn him hell encounter the dreaded annihilator aliens. He also crosses paths with two killer whales in a scene of eye-popping choreographed action. Mumbles close encounter with Earths dominators and the detritus of their activities powerfully imagined from the birds point of view proves thoroughly sobering; following logically pic would end on a quite dire note. Given this impossibility Miller and fellow screenwriters John Collee Judy Morris and Warren Coleman contrive a way to deliver a relatively upbeat ending one that doesnt completely dismiss the peril but still seems concocted. While having been nimbly edited for momentum and flow ""Happy Feet"" employs long takes and the moving ""camera"" considerably more than do most animated films. Result is a film of heightened elegance and precision as well as a strong sense of space; the widescreen frame can barely contain the vast landscapes as well as a bulging cast of happy-footed ""extras"" that would have turned Busby Berkeley green with envy. Pic reps the most ambitious and successful use of the motion-capture technique to date. Musical elements overseen by composer John Powell are extraordinarily diverse in style. At times the familiarity of song selections proves tiresome and overbearing. At others however freshness of the covers and novelty of the contexts are genuinely funny among them a Spanish-lingo version of ""My Way"" an ironic rendering of ""Leader of the Pack"" and some Beach Boys-backed surfing unlike anyone in Malibu has ever done. A Babels brew of accents comprise the spirited voicings with Williams doing fine double-duty in focused funny mode. End credits which contain more than 1000 names may be the longest on record.
