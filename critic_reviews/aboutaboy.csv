With Hugh Grant Toni Collette Rachel Weisz Nicholas Hoult. Directed by Paul and Chris Weitz. Running time 101 mins. Rated PG-13 Brief strong language. 3 Stars Even people who dont usually like Hugh Grant will be charmed by him in the scrappy slightly scandalous comedy ""About a Boy."" The foppish self-deprecating shambling romantic of ""Notting Hill"" is gone. In his place is a new Hugh a guy with no conscience who pretends he is a single father in order to get more dates. Even so he remains adorable and Grants expert comic timing pulls off the most withering lines such as ""Thats the problem with charity you have to mean it."" Its directed by the brothers Paul and Chris Weitz whose ""American Pie"" would not immediately nominate them for something as cheekily sophisticated as an adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel. The child that worms his way into the cagey bachelors heart is as familiar to the movies as a well-gummed pacifier. Adam Sandlers ""Big Daddy"" as excruciating as it was earned major bucks off the same premise. But ""About a Boy"" is a different animal. While suicide depression a dead duck and lying to seduce women are all played for laughs the tone and characters keep you rooted in a real world of inner pain loneliness and self-deception. The boy in ""About a Boy"" is Will (Grant) a 38-year-old Peter Pan who is perfectly happy watching game shows all day with no human commitments to tie him down. He lives off the royalties of a hit Christmas tune his father wrote. Life couldnt be sweeter unless of course there was a simpler way of picking up women for frivolous sexual encounters. And there is. Will pretends he has a little boy at home and this allows him into the graces and beds of all the single mommies out there struggling to find a simpatico partner. He joins SPAT Single Parents Alone Together and suffers the group therapy and the women wearing Lorena Bobbitt T-shirts as if it were just the cover price at an especially discriminating singles bar. The best part for Will is that the mothers usually break up with him before he gets around to it all for the noble sake of their children whom Will cant stand anyway. ""I really am this shallow"" he boasts to his sister and brother-in-law after rejecting their request that he be their babys godfather. (""Lets face it on her 18th birthday Id probably try to shag her."") Wills responsibility-free world is rocked slowly then faster by Marcus (the Vulcan-eyebrowed Nicholas Hoult) an annoying 12-year-old who starts hanging out with Will in order to escape his suicide-prone mom (Toni Collette). The movie is structured on parallel interior monologues one by the boy one by the man-boy both of them selfish. Marcus figures that if Will dated his mom she wouldnt be so hard to handle (""I need backup""). And Will finds Marcus useful when he pretends to a new love interest (Rachel Weisz) that he has a son then has to produce one. The Weitz brothers helped adapt the novel and admirably kept its London milieu unlike that other Hornby adaptation ""High Fidelity"" which got a transatlantic makeover. None of the characters are cloying which is quite an achievement and the script is razor-sharp. The result is sure to be a comedy hit but its secret is that it delves deeper than the usual summer fare. ""Once you open your door to one person anyone can come in"" grumbles Will but we detect a faint heartbeat after all.

"Insomnias nerve-jangling perpetual sunset. Slate Sign In Sign Up Insomnias nerve-jangling perpetual sunset. Insomnias nerve-jangling perpetual sunset. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 24 2002 1048 AM Hard Days Night Insomnia sleepwalks through its plot yet still delivers a nerve-jangling jolt; plus About a Boy The Believer and Bartleby. By David Edelstein Pacino and Williams tussle in the land of the midnight sun Having missed the Norwegian film on which the new Al Pacino-Robin Williams thriller Insomnia (Warner Bros.) is based Im disqualified from making breezy remarks about the awkwardness of the American translation or the damaging impact of Hollywood stars on its fragile Norwegian mood. Damn. Ill just have to take it on its own terms--which is OK since its sensationally made and in patches pretty nerve-jangling. The young British director Christopher Nolan has quickly become a specialist in putting you inside the heads of men whose perceptions have been fractured. Last year it was the short-term-memory-impaired hero of Memento; this time its the increasingly exhausted Will Dormer (Pacino) a Los Angeles detective helping out on a murder case in northern Alaska where the sun in midsummer never fully goes down. As Stephen Sondheim once phrased it ""Perpetual sunset is rather an unsettling thing""--especially if like Dormer your guilty conscience would be enough to keep you awake even without all that invasive white light spilling in under the window shades. Dormer accidentally kills someone in the course of a fog-blanketed manhunt and for reasons too complicated to recount here impulsively blames the act on the suspect in the initial murder--the only witness as it turns out to what really happened. All night Dormer stares at the digital clock in his Alaskan motel room the silence broken by the occasional phone call from the murderer he came to hunt--a fellow insomniac who is now in effect his co-conspirator. Unable to see a way through his predicament Dormer essentially sleepwalks through the investigation while the young Alaskan cop (Hilary Swank) who reveres him begins to wake up to the fact that hes keeping something secret. Advertisement Insomnia gives Pacino the opportunity to spend two hours in a sort of electrified stupor--not much of a stretch actually since hes often simultaneously manic and zoned-out. An actor less weirdly self-encased might have had more surprises in him but few could have gone so far. At first he plays Dormer slightly crotchety his distracted manner and tenor rasp recalling Michael Moriarty in his Law amp; Order days. Then with lack of sleep his singsong begins to sound like iambic pentameter his groggy cadences become more distended yet. Pacino turns out to have many levels of stuporous-ness; when you think he cant sink any lower hes into the subbasement and then the sub-subbasement until you start to look around for the Phantom of the Opera. Director Nolan abets Pacino with a syntax both slurry and percussively splintered--the soundscape either too muffled or too sharp the white light stabbing. He and his hair-trigger editor Dody Dorn remove connective tissue from the chases so that youre always off balance the cuts coming a half-second before you expect them. Glimpsed quickly from behind surrounded by fog or scampering over rocks or logs the killer is like some eerie Yeti at the edge of consciousness. The climax is unbelievably clunky in construction yet its so explosively edited with split-second close-ups that recall the finale of Bonnie and Clyde (1967) that I forgot my disappointment until it had ended--when my disappointment returned but not too insistently. It should be said that beyond the ingenious insomniac doppelganger premise (borrowed) this is a lifeless script. Dormer is being hounded by an internal affairs officer in Los Angeles and through the phone you can hear this cowardly parasite sneer. The plot twists are rickety the revelations stock and the motives of the killer--especially in the hackneyed scenes leading up to the final shootout--baffling. It must have made more sense in Norwegian. I like Hilary Swanks sharp new haircut which makes her face seem less angular but the eager-beaver act that worked gangbusters in Boys Dont Cry (1999) is a little creepy without the ironic sexual role reversal. As a woman shes charisma-free. With a run-of-the-mill bad-guy actor playing chief suspect Walter Finch the movie might have tipped too far Pacinos way. But Robin Williams is a shockingly effective counterweight. The key is what he doesnt do Those rubber features remain rigid that madcap energy harnessed. The sour little curl of Williams mouth reminds me of Laurence Olivier in The Entertainer (1960)--all the paranoid alertness of a stand-up comic with none of the genial pandering. There is nothing so despairing--or potentially so lethal--as a clown who has given up hope of making us laugh but wants to have an impact on us anyway. Rachel Weisz pulls Hugh Grant to the mainland Advertisement I havent heard many unsparkling words on the subject of About a Boy (Universal Pictures) an adaptation of Nick Hornbys second novel and Im not about to add any--its irresistible damn it. Mainstream comedies should all be this funny and tender and deftly performed. It opens with a thesis that can be easily dynamited--an assertion by its rich lazy narcissistic protagonist Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) that all men are John Donne notwithstanding islands and that his island happens to be a paradise. Wills sleazy attempt to exploit the sexual needs of single moms leads him in a roundabout way to the movies other protagonist a friendless fatherless 12-year-old geek called Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) whose most fervent desire is to connect with someone beside his glum suicidal mom (Toni Collette). Wills drive to be a free man is just as strong as Marcus to be attached but the comic standoff is ultimately settled by John Donne whose sentiments on the subject of men and islands are not--no surprise--to be sneezed at. Three things account for much of the movies charm. The first is Hugh Grant who adds nothing new to his virtuoso repertoire of self-conscious tics and stammers but who has become savvy enough to search out ironic contexts for them The adorably boyish act is not just Grants its Wills and it threatens to imprison this Freeman in a solipsistic cocoon. The second is that the gags all bloom out of the characters loneliness--they have unexpected emotional heft. Last the script (by Peter Hedges and directors Chris and Paul Weitz) does a phenomenal job of weaving narration in and out of dialogue. Students of screenwriting should study this hard. Unlike the writers of the last Hornby adaptation High Fidelity (2000) these guys know the difference between a public and a private utterance and why the two arent interchangeable. That knowledge means everything in a movie in which the chasm between what people permit themselves to say to one another and what theyre actually thinking is the source of all the comedy--and the terror of isolation too. I would hate to have to diagram the emotional trajectory of Danny (Ryan Gosling) the prodigiously conflicted protagonist of Henry Beans The Believer (Fireworks Pictures). Hes a Jew who becomes a Jew-stomping Nazi skinhead and then drifts in spite of himself back to Jewish ritual--desperately trying to rationalize his attraction to Torah and tefillin from a Nazi perspective. First he tells his fellow skinheads (who have no idea hes actually an ex-yeshiva boy) that one has to understand Jews to be able to destroy them; then he decides that the easiest way to destroy them would be to embrace and assimilate them--thus robbing them of their traditional outsider/victim roles. Confused? Not as much as Danny. By the end he has abstracted himself into oblivion. Finally showing up in theaters after a short run on Showtime The Believer was inspired by a real Ku Klux Klansman who when exposed by a reporter as a Jew committed suicide. But the movie leaves the realm of docudrama in the first second and rarely looks back. Its clear early on that Danny is so obsessed with his victimization that he has chosen to identify with the anti-Semitic aggressor. What is less clear--but remains tantalizing--is why Danny is also obsessed with the Genesis tale of God forcing Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac and its connection to the story of a Holocaust survivor who watched with horrified passivity as his young boy was murdered by the Nazis. My guess is Danny has some Daddy issues that Bean doesnt fully explore; instead he concentrates on the uneasy relationship between the young Nazi and a group of soft-spoken fascists (led by Billy Zane and Theresa Russell) who have mainstream political ambitions. Somewhere in all this confusion are a bunch of FBI informers and the daughter (Summer Phoenix) of a likely ex-Nazi who sleeps with Danny and is in no time reading Hebrew and lighting Shabbos candles. I confess I dont fully understand Dannys (or the movies) zigs and zags but I was glued to the thing anyway--it has an inexplicable inner logic--and I admire Bean for refusing to settle into any easy groove. Theres an angry searching spirit behind The Believer that transcends its particulars It might be the most honest attempt Ive seen in a movie to explore the sadomasochistic impulses that attach themselves to victimhood. And Ryan Gosling is enthrallingly good. Unlike the skinhead played by Edward Norton in American History X (1998) who was alternately a ropy sneering sociopath and a conscience-riddled do-gooder there are no seams in Goslings Danny. His fantasies of murdering and being murdered are all part of the same unholy roller coaster--and you see the terror in his eyes on the big dips. Paymer and Glover bring Melville to the modern office building Many of us have experienced Herman Melvilles devastating Bartleby the Scrivener as a tale of woe the story of a depressive copyist whose polite but firm refusal to be a cog in the capitalist machine drives his heretofore mechanical employer to genuine despair. The neat thing about Jonathan Parkers modern-day Bartleby (Outsider Pictures) is that it brings out all the vaudeville undercurrents in Melvilles dark tale and turns it into a surreal tragi-sitcom for our own era. The original Wall Street setting is now an isolated exurban office complex furnished in mismatched 60s colors (avocado tangerine) on a hill above a landscape threaded with freeways; the office workers are a crack ensemble of loons among them Maury Chaykin as a slobbola Glenne Headley as a loosey-goosey office manager and Joe Piscopo as a desperately flashy lady-killer. Bartleby is played by Crispin Glover whose stammering Martian schtick--abetted on the soundtrack by a theremin--finally feels at home. As the boss David Paymer anchors the slapstick and low comedy. One of the most gifted supporting players in Hollywood Paymer at last has a chance to show that the determined squirt he usually plays doesnt have to be smaller-than-life--that even an unimaginative bureaucrat can say to the universe ""Sir I exist"" SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

And thats as good an explanation as any for why our human species happens to be the most lifeless of the myriad life forms swarming through this latest Lucasfilm extravaganza. I wouldnt be surprised if the life form known as George Lucas weary from trying to recapture the joyous spirit of long ago had secretly cloned himself and sent his doppelganger to do the writing and directing this time around. For all its video-game bedazzlements ""Attack of the Clones"" suffers from severe digital glut periodically relieved if you can call it that by amateur theatrics. Some of the action sequences are exciting enough and beautifully executed on their own terms a high-speed pursuit aboard candy-colored speeders through the dense airborne traffic of Coruscant the planet-sized city that sprawls up just as much as out; another chase through a vast asteroid field thats enhanced by voluptuous delayed-reaction explosions. (Amusingly a few of the spaceships sound like Flying Fortresses from World War II.) But the too-muchness of the movie as a whole dulls the brilliance of its best accomplishments. Now that those special-effects wizards at Industrial Light and Magic can do anything under our sun or any other they do everything -- every single or multiple thing they can think of to thicken the visual texture (eye candy that threatens retinal rot) or to swell the ranks of the extragalactic menagerie. A gladiatorial contest on a red-rock planet called Geonosis pits human heroes against so many variations on the theme of monstrous predator that simple suspense hasnt got a chance; how exciting can it be when the danger is obviously virtual? Exciting enough you can bet for the millions of hard-core fans wholl make ""Attack of the Clones"" a monster hit. But ""Episode I"" provoked an angry backlash even among true believers and this one will too. While ""Spider-Man"" shows how to launch a new franchise ""Episode II"" shows how to sink one. ""Attack of the Clones"" takes place a decade after ""The Phantom Menace"" when the Republic is threatened by a separatist movement and the parents-to-be of Luke and Leia are old enough to fall in love. Anakin Skywalker is now played very drearily by Hayden Christensen. The role of Padme Amidala formerly the teenage queen of the planet Naboo and now a senator goes once again to Natalie Portman who recites her lines as if from cue cards and who looks older by at least 30 or 40 months. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi has matured from headstrong student to Anakins teacher and something of a martinet though its still inconceivable that he could ever grow into Alec Guinness. Jar Jar Binks whom I described three years ago as a Rastafarian Stepin Fetchit on platform hoofs has also been given a senate seat and mercifully less screen time; hes become a blabby Uncle Jemimah telling Anakin that ""missa bustin with happiness to see you."" These are sorry substitutes for such previous charmers as Princess Leia in her full spunkiness the wryly witty Han Solo or even the pleasingly earnest Luke. Yet you cant blame actors particularly young ones when the words put in their mouths are almost unspeakable -- Mr. Lucas brought in a co-writer Jonathan Hales but it didnt help -- and the direction seems to suck them dry of energy or spontaneity. (Heres one definition of the performers ultimate nightmare Having to act in the physical and emotional void of a blue-screen set while being directed by a black hole.) At least the digital creatures are endowed with extra limbs or funny shapes but theres nothing to be done for Anakin and Padme when they dally in a meadow right out of ""The Sound of Music"" only to exchange turgid observations about democracy vs. totalitarianism. As Darth Vader-to-be Anakin betrays a budding sympathy for dictators. That displeases Padme enough to make her squint. One genuine distinction of ""Episode II"" is the cinematography. This is the first big-budget feature to be shot entirely with a digital video camera and thus the first to be spared the ravages of fading or color shifts over the course of time; once an image is digitized its there to stay. In the version I saw which was projected conventionally not digitally the images looked fine though they may have lacked some of the sharpness and tonal depth that film at its best can convey. Another distinction derives partly from the digital domain and largely from the realm of old-fashioned showmanship. ""Attack of the Clones"" reaches a rousing climax when the ancient and all-wise Yoda -- hes become all-computer-generated as well -- does gallant battle with the vile Count Dooku who is played by Christopher Lee. (Yes the same elegant octogenarian who did bad-guy duty in the first episode of ""The Lord of the Rings."") Its thrilling to see Yoda put down his walking stick take up his light saber vanquish evil with the vitality of a young man then retrieve his stick and hobble offstage. Its inspiring too -- so much so that George Lucas himself might take a leaf from Yodas book. Theres no limit to what an old geezer can do if he really wants to. About a Boy ""About a Boy"" is better than a feelgood movie its a feelgreat movie -- genuinely clever affecting when you least expect it to be and funny from start to finish. Who could have imagined that a contemporary comedy set in London starring Hugh Grant and directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz the co-directors of ""American Pie"" would be such a blast of fresh air? Certainly not me. I thought Id had the Weitz brothers pegged correctly as purveyors of high-grade sweet-spirited gross-out. I thought Id seen what there was to see of Hugh Grants not inconsiderable range from charmingly shallow cad to touchingly witty fool. But I was wrong on both counts. All concerned seem to have reinvented themselves even though what theyve really done is rise to the challenge and opportunity of a good story exuberantly told about a boy who brings happiness and purpose into a lonely womanizers life. If this sounds manipulative or shameless be assured that the movie is anything but (except for one climactic scene in a school auditorium that I resisted briefly and then gladly embraced). ""About a Boy"" was adapted by Peter Hedges and the Weitz brothers from the novel of the same name by Nick Hornby who also wrote ""High Fidelity."" The humor here is mercurial -- sometimes astringent tender or absurd or at a few choice moments so misanthropic as to recall the sainted W.C. Fields. And as in ""High Fidelity"" the filmmakers have been wise enough to use generous dollops of the authors prose in voice-overs that in this instance reveal the innermost thoughts of man and boy alike. (Although given the mans immaturity the title could describe either one.) Mr. Grant plays Will a rich guy as well as a lonely guy who doesnt have to work because his long-dead father wrote a Christmas ditty that still generates enormous royalties. Avid for sex phobic about commitment and a compulsive liar in the bargain Will stumbles on what seems to be the perfect stratagem seeking out single mothers then using the fact of their motherhood as an excuse when its time to squirm out of the relationship. His first catch is the alluring Suzie (Victoria Smurfit) but then a 12-year-old misfit named Marcus the latchkey son of Suzies best friend bonds with him willy-nilly and Will discovers to his horror that he cares about the kid in return. The plot itself is a perfect stratagem for opening up Wills closed-off personality -- he goes from shallow cadhood through shocked self-recognition a stretch of depression and eventually though not sentimentally to self-fulfillment. Mr. Grant looking lean and rangy has never been more energetic or more attractive. Nicholas Hoult the youngster who plays Marcus is delightful too although the directors might have slowed down some of his hurried line readings. (At this point in his physical development Nicholas has Kim Novaks eyes and David Hemmingss eyebrows.) The fine cast includes Toni Collette as Marcuss wacko hippie mom and Rachel Weisz as the woman Will finally deserves.  DVD TIP Ive recommended it before on videotape but now ""Silent Running"" (1971) has been given fittingly special treatment on a new DVD that will be available later this month. Douglas Trumbull whose special-effects work was seen in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" directed this prescient film now a sci-fi classic. Bruce Dern stars as Lowell a botanist aboard a space freighter who becomes Earths last gardener. Hes assisted by two robots Huey and Dewey who bear a remarkable resemblance to the R2D2 of ""Star Wars"" which came out six years later.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The hotly anticipated follow-up to his incisive and funny debut novel High Fidelity Nick Hornbys About A Boy was dismissed for ladling sentiment onto essentially the same story A single pop-culture-obsessed hipster in his 30s with no commitments and little ambition gets yanked reluctantly into adulthood. But why complain when Hornby writes the character so vividly with so many fresh insights into the male psyche and the cracked philosophies of terminal bachelorhood? In Chris and Paul Weitzs brisk endearing adaptation Hugh Grant plays an older slightly oilier version of High Fidelitys John Cusack an unemployed cad who has sealed himself off in a self-described ""island paradise"" of CDs DVDs cable television and sleek gadgetry. Living well off the royalties from his fathers Christmas novelty song Grant divides his day into 30-minute ""units of time"" which he spends on activities such as watching game shows getting his hair professionally mussed and bedding young Swedish tourists. After dating a single mother he believes hes stumbled onto the perfect formula Hes treated like a hero compared to the absent father he gets to have passionate sex and he doesnt have to be the one to break off the relationship before it gets too serious. But his scheme to create an imaginary son for a single parents group backfires when he meets Nicholas Hoult an adolescent misfit who clings to him as a backup to his suicidal mother (Toni Collette). Saddled with unwanted responsibility Grant gives the poor kid lessons on how to be cool the one subject on which hes an expert. Few scenarios are more cliched than the curmudgeonly father-figure who takes in the precocious imp--irritation in the first two acts love in the third--but Hornby infuses it with warmth and honesty not to mention his obvious gift for wry observation. Previously known for lowbrow comedies (American Pie Down To Earth) that are alternately sweet and inept the Weitz brothers were not an obvious choice for the material which doesnt always lend itself to such a broad treatment. None of the gags are subtle yet their populist instincts are nicely tempered by the earthy chemistry between the two leads and a soundtrack of original Badly Drawn Boy songs that comment on the action without intruding on it. Compared to High Fidelity the book and the movie About A Boy seems resolutely uncool exactly the sort of earnest and formulaic nonsense that would make a Hornby hero retch. But part of growing up may be admitting that such familiar comforts can also be immensely satisfying.

Hugh Grant is both the strongest and the weakest component of ""About a Boy"" a pic version of British author Nick Hornbys 1998 bestseller that cant decide whether its a romantic comedy in Working Title-branded mode or a lower-key more observational look at contempo manhood in Hornby mode. Theres a strong case for saying Grant who awkwardly tries to proletaricize his accent is miscast in the role of the womanizing child-fearing slacker who gets in touch with his touchy-feely side through a friendship with a pre-teen boy. But the fact is pic only really sizzles when Grant gives full rein to his patented comic shtick as a bumbling romantic. Pleasant and engaging rather than laugh-out-loud funny or emotionally involving the movie looks to reap comfortable rather than stellar ""Bridget Jones""-like returns as much thanks to the built-in attraction of the original novel as to Grants name presence. Pic preems April 26 in the U.K. and then travels Stateside. Though Paul and Chris Weitz (""American Pie"") may seem a strange choice to direct and co-write such quintessentially British fare -- which unlike the film version of Hornbys second novel ""High Fidelity"" has not been transferred to an American setting -- the two brothers in fact do a culturally neutral job in both adapting and directing. (Chris Weitz was in fact educated in the U.K. and subsequently worked there for a spell before returning to the U.S.) In any event and despite Robert De Niros Tribeca Prods. being the original optioner of the novels rights the finished product has no feel of Hollywoodization or being watered down for an international audience. And though much of the novels incidental detail and Hornbys involving prose style arent replicated onscreen fans of the book will recognize enough of the original not to be disappointed. Grant plays Will a late-30s unattached Londoner whos never had a job or been in a relationship thats lasted more than two months. Will has a neat bachelor apartment and a comfortable life living off the royalties of a corny Christmas carol (""Santa Super Sleigh"") his late dad once composed and devotes his time to picking up women and generally avoiding responsibility of any kind. Top of his dislike list is children; but if it means staying close to a babe he fancies such as single mother Angie (Isabel Brook) hell even keep quiet about that. In parallel pic also introduces Marcus a 12-year-old rather nerdy boy whos still walked to school by his mom Fiona (Toni Collette with an immaculate English accent). A baggy-trousered vegetarian ex-hippie Fiona is a tad unbalanced emotionally; and Marcus with his pudding-basin haircut and Dr. Spock-like eyebrows regularly gets it in the neck from cooler kids at school. As he notes in his voiceover ""So there you have it. I was having a shit time at home and a shit time at school."" Gently ditched by Angie Will goes to a single-parent help group as he reckons its a good place to meet women. Unnerved to discover that theyre either plain ugly man-hating or emotionally screwed up but attracted to the sole beauty in the group Irishwoman Susie (Victoria Smurfit) he invents a totally fictitious story on the spot about being dumped by his partner and left with a 2-year-old kid Ned. The ruse works and Will starts dating Susie. Susies best friend however is Fiona and on an outing one day she brings along not only her own kid but also Marcus -- and at the 20-minute mark the movies twin strands finally meet. In a very funny scene in a public park where Grants fumbling persona is allowed full play Marcus and Will connect. Back at the boys home however Fiona has attempted suicide -- which requires a mad dash to a hospital that neatly combines drama and comedy. As Will notes in a boyish voiceover ""It was horrible horrible. But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic."" Thereafter the stage is set for the main story a friendship between a rather mature but lonely 12-year-old boy and a rather immature but equally lonely 38-year-old boy both of whom finally learn that in life everybody needs somebody. Though this revelation is signaled a good six reels from the end its a convenient hook on which to hang further amorous adventures by Will notably with the very focused Rachel (Rachel Weisz) who -- in some of the movies funniest scenes -- has a son (Augustus Prew) of Marcus age who turns out to be a total psychopath. Some of the incidental humor wont translate for non-British auds from exchanges like ""No man is an island"" (Fiona)/""Im an island Im Ibiza"" (Will) to Wills favorite home pastime of watching the inexplicably long-running quiz show ""Countdown."" Also a subplot of Marcus having a crush on a tough older chick at school -- fully developed in the original novel -- never really gets off the starting block here. Still though the dialogue rarely strikes sparks the movie hums along in an agreeable enough way remaining very character-centered. This is a London in tight closeup not a capital city of recognizable landmarks or movie geography A large percentage of the picture takes place in apartments restaurants and other enclosed spaces cleanly rather than glossily lensed by Remi Adefarasin and with no directing flourishes by the Weitz Bros. Its at the 75-minute point however that the films split personality begins to tell. When Marcus asks for Wills help in solving a problem and Will explains hes actually not the kids father or brother theres a lack of emotional undertow of any tumblers falling into place to make the scene work. And the pics climax set at a concert at Marcus school feels manufactured rather than organically grown out of seeds planted earlier The biggest high in fact comes from Grant resorting to his usual physical mannerisms not from any sense of emotional resolution. Playing a character his own age Hoult previously only with TV experience more than holds his own against the experienced Grant especially in their numerous scenes just sitting around together in Wills apartment. As the no-nonsense Susie Smurfit is notable in a relatively small role and Weisz an actress who needs strong direction is for once well cast and assured as Rachel. Collette is OK as Marcus mom but her character swinging between serious and goofy often seems out of kilter with the rest of the cast.

Comments About a Boy Few movies have made better use of Hugh Grants shallow charm and amused befuddlement than this funny and well-paced adaptation of Nick Hornbys best-selling second novel which charts the unlikely friendship between a preteen nerd crossing over into adolescence (Nicholas Hoult) and a thirtysomething hipster hanging on to it for dear life. Like High Fidelity the film drawn from Hornbys first novel About a Boy faithfully re-creates the books comic encounters yet relies on endless and finally irksome narration to communicate its offbeat emotional insights. The screenplay by Peter Hedges and directors Paul and Chris Weitz neatly compresses Hornbys story line and updates the action from the early 90s to the present replacing a key incident--the suicide of rocker Kurt Cobain--with a lighter and more conventional climax. The change is illuminating with their energy and wit Hornbys novels may seem tailor-made for the screen but his gift for rendering characters through their immersion in pop culture proves elusive.

Hes also as played by Hugh Grant with devilish charm irresistible. Theres something bracing about a movie hero this blithely irresponsible especially when he narrates his own tale with a cynical wit Oscar Wilde might envy. Movie purists will tell you that a heavy reliance on voice-over is a sin (""show dont tell"") but when the words are this funny to hell with purity.Always in pursuit of fresh female conquests Will starts frequenting meetings of SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) where posing as a single dad he picks up vulnerable single moms. This is how he comes to meet 12-year-old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) the nerdy son of a depressive and badly dressed vegetarian (Toni Collette). The fatherless Marcus insinuates himself into Wills life. We know of course that before the tale is over Marcus will be the source of Wills redemption. But if the uplifting ending is preordained and a bit pat theres nothing predictable--or less than delightful--about the route this adaptation of Nick Hornbys novel takes to get there. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz working from a script they wrote with Peter Hedges wring just the right amount of poignance from the comedy without ever getting sappy. Their sophisticated crowd pleaser is the first big studio movie of 2002 I didnt want to end.

Weitz based on the book by Nick Hornby gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanizing and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. Here he tackles a particularly irresponsible rascal named Will a 38-year-old London male butterfly who actually boasts of his own shallowness while shunning emotional commitments like a dread disease. A freakish bequest from his otherwise musically untalented songwriter father whose only 10-strike was a mediocre Christmas jingle that swept the country has made Will wealthy enough to enjoy a life of hedonistic indolence for as long as Christmas continues to be celebrated in Britain. The cream of the jest is that Will cant stand to hear his fathers stupid song. Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth and spitting at it The seduction of single women takes up most of Wills nights but lately hes found it increasingly difficult to break the bad news to conquests he has decided to dump. Then one night a single mom with whom hes enjoyed a fling turns the tables on him by tearfully and regretfully dumping him a moment before he could begin dumping her. By now in his comically sadomasochistic career Mr. Grant has developed perfect timing; he feigns sincerity and gets the biggest laughs. This old dog loves to learn new tricks. His painless experience with the single mom leads him to stalk his prey at SPAT-Single Parents Alone Together. Looking for new pleasures Will poses as a single dad whos left his 2-year-old at home with a sitter and invades the single-parent support group. But instead of yummy mummies hes confronted with an array of losers. Here the movie settles for some cheap giggles at the expense of unattractive women whove been abandoned by their husbands. Before the misogyny can be worked too hard Will is thrust into the company of Fiona (Toni Collette) her awkward 12-year-old son Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) Fionas best friend Suzie (Victoria Smurfit) and her own little girl Megan. Will is much more taken with Suzie than with Fiona who is too much a washed-out hippie for his taste. But Marcus who becomes a co-protagonist with his own interior monologue has other plans for Will He wants him not as his mothers boyfriend but as his own surrogate father. Will the stalker finds himself stalked by Marcus and in the process becomes slowly attached to the boy for a few laughs and a big payoff in sentiment. Its something of a surprise when Suzie drops Will because he lied about having a 2-year-old. But Will falls seriously in love with Rachel (Rachel Weisz) an artistically talented single mom with an insanely jealous boy of her own named Ali (Augustus Prew) who threatens to kill Marcus if Will who has been posing as his father tries to move in with him and Rachel. The Ali-Marcus scenes are alone worth the price of admission hilarious riffs on the fierce possessiveness of single-parent children. The film is not without its flaws. The school scenes in which Marcus is tormented for being ""different"" are forced and half-hearted. Its never made clear why Fiona is endlessly despondent (she even attempts suicide) and the sudden romance of Will and Rachel seems like an afterthought designed to erase our memory of Wills swinish behavior. This is to say that Rachel is a prize Will hardly deserves. In the end the film comes over as a messy delight thanks to the skill generosity and good-sport punching-bag panache of Mr. Grants performance. Almost Like Vertigo Michael Apteds Enigma  from a screenplay by Tom Stoppard based on the novel by Robert Harris is the first film in my experience even to mention the Soviet Katyn massacre of Polish army officers during World War II. In all the current talk about atrocities here and there its well to remember that until the stench from the corpses became intolerable the Anglo-American left did its utmost to conceal Stalins mass-homicidal crimes. The generally underrated Enigma reminded me also of Alfred Hitchcocks Vertigo (1958). Code-breaking specialist Tom Jericho (Dougray Scott) becomes obsessed to the point of a nervous breakdown after being rejected by femme fatale Claire Romilly (Saffron Burrows) and then finds recovery and redemption in the arms of bespectacled Hester Wallace (Kate Winslet). Its as if James Stewart had been sensible enough to accept Barbara Bel Geddes proffered love and thus had cured himself of his ruinous infatuation with the literally duplicitous Kim Novak. Toms obsession with Claire is tangled up with the mystery of her disappearance and the possibility that British code secrets have been betrayed to the Germans. The high-tech mumbo-jumbo about Enigma and Shark code machines comes off as something more than one of Hitchcocks MacGuffins-that is a mere pretext to generate suspense. Cracking the Enigma code contributed mightily to winning the war against Hitler and the achievement was not adequately appreciated and commemorated until long afterwards. That however is not what the film is really about. Mr. Apted Mr. Stoppard and Mr. Harris have collaborated on a series of spectacles that suggest the high stakes in this episode in the history of cryptanalysis. The Germans here are treated with great dignity and sobriety as they go about the task of sinking Allied ships or recording the identities of Polish officers buried at Katyn. Jeremy Northam plays the debonair spy-catcher Wigram with just a touch of tension-easing comic relief. The anti-Hitchcockian ending stresses ambiguity over lucidity except for the romantically satisfying union of Tom and Hester. Enigma is anything but enigmatic about affairs of the heart and is well worth seeing for its elective affinities alone. Self-Hating Jew Henry Beans The Believer  from Mr. Beans own screenplay based on a story by Mr. Bean and Mark Jacobson was inspired by the real-life (and death) drama of Daniel Burros who lived in Ozone Park Queens and was a member of the American Nazi Party and later King Kleagle of the Ku Klux Klan for New York City. When Burros was interviewed by a reporter for The New York Times and confronted with evidence that he was himself a Jew he warned the reporter ""You print that in The New York Times  Ill kill you and Ill kill myself."" The story ran all the same and Burros went upstairs and shot himself ""Twice. Once in the chest and when that didnt work a second time in the head."" This grim story is recounted in Mr. Beans introduction to the published screenplay which is subtitled ""Confronting Jewish Self-Hatred."" This is a term that was coined about the time of the Burros suicide in 1965. After widespread criticism of The Times for printing the story two of its rising journalists Abe Rosenthal and Arthur Gelb collaborated on a book entitled One More Victim  arguing that Burros suicide was a product of Jewish self-hatred in the wake of Nazi genocide (the word ""Holocaust"" was not yet in common usage). Burros Mr. Rosenthal and Mr. Gelb asserted was a victim of Hitler not of The New York Times . Elsewhere in his introduction Mr. Bean describes his own skeptical position vis-a-vis Israel and Zionism as one akin to what Philip Roth has designated as ""diasporatic."" This would be enough in some Israeli circles for Mr. Bean and Mr. Roth to be branded ""self-hating Jews."" Theres very little said about Israel in The Believer  but a great deal of ranting about how Jews are prone to being victimized. Indeed the early images of the film show Ryan Goslings Danny Balint stalking a Jewish student wearing a yarmulke and giving this unresisting victim a beating accompanied by much taunting. Later in a flashback we learn that Danny was previously a rebellious yeshiva student questioning Gods command that Abraham sacrifice his son Isaac. The story of the Jewish Nazi skinhead is retold from inside the Jewish experience. Mr. Beans Danny has no connection with the Klan and theres only one brief racist encounter with African-Americans. The rest is one obscene anti-Semitic epithet after another. In fact when Danny is recruited by a shadowy fascist organization meeting at the home of Lina Moebius (Theresa Russell) the leader of the group Curtis Zampf (Billy Zane) advises Danny to soft-pedal his outdated virulent anti-Semitism for tactical reasons. Perhaps the tenacity with which Mr. Bean has been developing The Believer over a 20-year period may account for a certain fuzziness in Dannys character and his seeming nostalgia for his yeshiva roots. Mr. Gosling so charismatic as the student murderer in Murder by Numbers  holds The Believer together by the sheer force of his personality. His Danny can play rough with Linas daughter Carla (Summer Phoenix) and make her like it and the audience accept it since they are immediately distracted by Dannys proficiency in Hebrew and his ability to teach it to the curious girl. Still the objection can be made that what little we get of Dannys backstory fails to close the gap between the truculent yeshiva student he was and the Nazi skinhead he became. Danny Burros like Danny Balint was an aberration of history. The fact that he existed is not sufficient to make him an adequate model for a dramatic character. Besides what little motivation Mr. Bean gives to Mr. Balint depends on the alleged tendency of Jews to give up without a fight to walk into the ovens without making a fuss. But what has this to do with a few million Israelis who have managed to enrage a few billion people around the world? Theres certainly no Israeli reluctance to defend the countrys existence. Was not their will to fight in the Middle East forged in the furnaces of the Nazi death camps? The point is that Mr. Beans diagnosis of Jewish self-hatred in The Believer may be misdirected in the present circumstances. And with all due deference to the diasporists there seem to be many non-elitist Jews who need soil under their feet to stand tall.

"About a Boy Just About Brilliant washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids About a Boy Just About Brilliant Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 17 2002 ""ABOUT a Boy"" is not only hilarious touching and wonderfully dyspeptic its grounds for Hugh Grants canonization as the patron saint of all cads. Will Freeman is a bachelor who practically glistens with egocentricity as he wanders through his corner of London thinking purely about his own comforts buying CDs polishing his Audi Coupe buying expensive clothes and chasing every woman that moves. For Will this also means disappointing discarding and disrespecting women at every turn. ""I never watched a woman cry without feeling responsible"" he says at one point. In the movie based on the Nick Hornby novel and directed by Chris and Paul Weitz Will is the undisputed center of his own universe self-absorbed smug and ready to escape the slightest hint of responsibility maturity or commitment. Of course he does all this with that top-drawer English accent - an effortlessly posh articulation that coats his moral shortcomings in soothing mother-of-pearl. Supported by royalties from a silly Christmas song (""Santas Super Sleigh"") written by his late father Will has no reason to grow up start a family or do anything. But he does have his passion for women. And when we meet him he has discovered a whole new world that of single mothers. It seems theres a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) which brings divorced or separated parents (mostly mothers) together for group-hug sessions. It doesnt take long for Will to smell opportunity. Pretending to be a single father with a son Will regales the group with his saintly stories and swiftly becomes a hit with the group. Theyre touched by his sensitivity. And being the uber-cad that he is Will takes complete advantage. But alas Will is ultimately doomed to reap what he sows. And the agent of his moral comeuppance is a precocious 12-year-old named Marcus (a remarkably assured Nicholas Hoult) whos onto his game. Marcuss deal is simple. He promises not to blow Wills cover if the anti-father lets him hang out chez Will. After all Wills got an ultra-hip bachelor pad where the sound system and television are awesome. Marcus has his own secrets too. Hes ducking out from bullies at his school and hes avoiding time with his hippie manic-depressive vegetarian of a single mother Fiona (Toni Collette). Wills life becomes a weird routine. After school Marcus knocks on the door. On goes the TV. And its the cad and the kid next to each other on the sofa. And when Marcus invites Will over to his moms for Christmas well brace yourself. Things are starting to smell suspiciously like family. Its been fashionable to beat up on old Hugh as a callow superficial type given to bumbling-Englishman roles. Fie I say. ""About a Boy"" is the movie to end such nonsense. Despite being cast as essentially the antichrist hes engaging and comical without coming across as ham-fisted and sitcom-slick. And when Will starts to change for the ""better"" he takes us through the painful evolution every step of the way strumming the chords to Roberta Flacks ""Killing Me Softly"" as he does. That song we discover functions as the movies pop-hymn of redemption. And its testament not only to Grants presence but great writing that this conceit never seems cheesy. Ah yes the writing. Grant would be nothing if not for the plentiful piercing wit of novelist Hornby as adapted by Peter Hedges and the Weitzes who yes also made ""American Pie."" (Who knew these brothers would evolve from teenage pie to this classier dish?) This movie isnt just great to watch its great for the ears to savor. When Will mentions his fathers famous song someone asks him if carol singers pay Will royalties every time they sing ""Santas Super Sleigh"" outside peoples front doors. ""Well they should"" says Will without batting an eye. ""But you cant always catch the little bastards."" See what I mean? So charming. ABOUT A BOY (PG-13 101 minutes) - Contains mild obscenity.

"About a Boy A Rakes Amusingly Slow Progress washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies About a Boy A Rakes Amusingly Slow Progress Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday May 17 2002 Amid the bells whistles and other shiny objects that typify the summer movie season comes a true gem a film that elicits its emotional payoffs the old-fashioned way with emotions. Hugh Grant reminds audiences that hes an actor rather than a jumble of ingratiating mannerisms in ""About a Boy"" in which he thoroughly inhabits the persona of the contemporary London rake - a role with which he is not entirely unfamiliar. The difference this time is the conviction he brings to Will a hedonistic independently wealthy 38-year-old bachelor who when its suggested that he possesses untapped hidden depths quickly insists ""No no you see I really am this shallow."" Perhaps but in this winning tic-free performance Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire terror ambivalence and self-awareness. ""About a Boy"" begins with Will telling the audience how it all started which is with him leading his normal life Watching TV bedding (and promptly dumping) women and buying stuff for his very cool loft. Turning the old saw on its head Will insists that ""every man is an island"" and he is setting out to prove the point conducting himself in such a way that he wants for nothing and no one ensuring ""a long and depression-free life."" At one point a friend fixes Will up with a single mother who turns out to be for him the perfect relationship After a few weeks she saves him the trouble of calling the whole thing off by doing so herself admitting that shes just not ready for a serious boyfriend (the series of facial expressions that Grant exhibits at this news is alone worth the price of admission). Seeing the endless possibilities of relationships that have built-in detonation devices Will concocts an imaginary 2-year-old for himself and joins SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) where hes the only man among women who wear T-shirts like one emblazoned with ""Lorena Bobbitt for Surgeon General."" Its through this group that circuitously Will will make the acquaintance of 12-year-old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) who lives with his New Agey and seriously depressive mother Fiona (Toni Collette in yet another spot-on portrayal of a barely functional basket case). Marcus has his own agenda Whereas Will thinks that one is the loveliest number Marcus has come to the conclusion that ""two isnt a big enough number. You need backup."" After Will and Marcus forge a rather tenuous bond during an unexpected episode involving Fiona Marcus begins single-mindedly to make Will a part of his life while Will just as determinedly sets limits on their friendship. Thus does the irresistible force meet the immovable object and the ensuing tussle reveals funny and often poignant truths about intimacy autonomy vulnerability and commitment - without thank Heaven ever using those exact words. ""About a Boy"" originated with the novel by Nick Hornby whose ""High Fidelity"" was adapted with such happy results a couple of years ago. ""About a Boy"" finds similar safe harbor here albeit in unlikely hands. Its no surprise that this funny observant screenplay was co-written by Peter Hedges (""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape?""). But it will shock some parents that Paul and Chris Weitz - the purveyors of ""American Pie"" no less - have made a movie that the parents will not only approve of but want to go see. The Weitzes have executed a hip whip-smart entertainment that finds its laughs in the slightly weary rue of the middle-aged rather than the bodily functions of the young and nubile. Whats more they have enlisted and worked wonders with a terrific cast most notably newcomer Hoult - whose elfin face and Spock-like eyebrows give him enough otherworldly mystery to be a social outcast on the playground - and Grant whose performance can only be described as revelatory. Oddly enough it might be the directors experience with the coarser elements of human nature that made them so perfectly suited to ""About a Boy."" Resisting the temptation to sentimentalize and soften Wills reluctant emotional growth the filmmakers have wisely hewn to Hornbys original vision (if not to his original ending) which is of a cad who ultimately makes some small adjustments but refuses to capitulate entirely. ""About a Boy"" is that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure prickly independence over fetishized coupledom and honesty over typical Hollywood endings. See it now because its going to be a long summer. ABOUT A BOY (PG-13 101 minutes) - Contains brief strong language and some thematic elements. At area theaters.

"USATODAY.com - About a Boy has singular charm Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 05/16/2002 - Updated 0858 PM ET About a Boy has singular charm By Claudia Puig USA TODAY About a Boy (out of four) Stars Hugh Grant Toni Collette Rachel Weisz Nicholas Hoult Directors Paul and Chris Weitz Rating PG-13 for brief strong language and some thematic elements. Most of us have uttered this familiar refrain The movie is never as good as the book. About a Boy flies in the face of that maxim. Adapted from Nick Hornbys acerbic and keenly observed novel about an unlikely friendship between a fatherless boy and a self-absorbed cad About a Boy is that rare film thats as clever and moving as the book on which it was based. Weve seen plenty of movies that follow the letter of the plot but miss the whimsy and spirit of the writer. (Harry Potter and The Shipping News come to mind.) Fortunately About a Boy captures the mood and feel of the book while adhering closely to the story. Read more below Video Hugh Grant plays the scoundrel View the trailer of About a Boy Stories Claudia Puig reviews About a Boy Actress Toni Collette is into her work Weitz brothers are diverse directors Hornby is the executive producer of the film and perhaps that made the difference. Also the script was co-written by Peter Hedges who wrote the superb Whats Eating Gilbert Grape. This film has a similar humanity. The biggest surprise is the identity of its writer/directors Paul and Chris Weitz the pair who served us American Pie. Who would have guessed that the creators of that sophomoric teen comedy could take a poignant novel and adapt it so winningly? About a Boy is about a boy who is lonely and fatherless. The sensitive 12-year-old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) strikes up an unlikely friendship with a self-absorbed trendy man in his mid-30s (Hugh Grant) with family money and no discernible goals other than to meet attractive women and zip around in his sports car. (The title might just as easily refer to the immature Grant as to the younger but wiser preteen.) Grant plays a lovable opportunist who attends a solo parenting group posing as the divorced dad of a 2-year-old as part of a scheme to meet and bed vulnerable single moms. Hitting just the right notes Grant is at his most appealing since Four Weddings and a Funeral. Gone are the self-conscious ""Arent I adorable"" mannerisms that seemed endearing at the start of his film career but have grown cloying in more recent movies. Toni Collette nails the part of Marcus eccentric free-spirited mother. Hoult in his first lead role puts in an impressive performance on a par with the adult veterans. About a Boy is a rarity in many ways. Its a well-written witty film whose memorable characters grapple with the nature of family love friendship and despair. Even its soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy is perfectly pitched. In a summer of daring superheroes and intergalactic spectacles its a pleasure to see a film that doesnt need special effects to be emotionally affecting.

Directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz from a screenplay by Peter Hedges Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz based on the novel by Nick Hornby. 102 minutes. Rated PG-13 for brief strong language and some thematic elements. Several theaters. In ""About a Boy"" Hugh Grant languidly cruises the aisle of a supermarket his small eyes darting from one attractive woman to another like an homage to his delicious entrance in ""Bridget Joness Diary."" Here his famously floppy hair has been reduced to fashionable spikes but otherwise its the same look a slippery-eyed barracuda in expensive sportswear. And Grant presents this persona absolutely unapologetically -- theres no hidden nice guy in that coolly appraising gaze. Hes having a terrific time and so are we. Now seems as good a time as any to bring up the Hugh Grant Problem that phenomenon that causes numerous moviegoers (mostly men) to roll their eyes when invited to ""a Hugh Grant movie."" Never mind that in ""About a Boy"" Grant doesnt stutter act sheepish or spill orange juice on Julia Roberts bosom -- some of you still will be having none of it. The Hugh Grant Problem is far-reaching -- I read in Esquire the opinion that if Grant were American he wouldnt be a movie star just a twerp. (This is of course nonsense -- if Hugh Grant were American hed be a sort of senior Josh Hartnett -- but never mind. Its clear enough which side of the Hugh Grant divide I fall on.) Anyway miss this movie at your peril. Based on Nick Hornbys delightful novel ""About a Boy"" is really about two boys Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) a troubled 12-year-old worried about his suicidal single mom (Toni Collette) and Will (Grant) a cheerfully shallow thirtysomething whose life quite intentionally is meaningless. The pair both Londoners meet up when Will invents an imaginary son in order to gain access to the dishy mums in a single-parent support group. Marcus and Will warily circle each other for a while and gradually become friends who learn from each other. Those with Hugh Grant Problems are already rolling their eyes -- youre just picturing sun-dappled scenes of Grant moppy hair falling on his brow reading Jane Austen with the kid right? Nope -- something far more interesting happens. Directors Paul and Chris Weitz (""American Pie"") resolutely fight tweeness throughout and mostly succeed. Young Marcus with his home-cut bangs is nobodys idea of a cute kid; hes genuinely weird and a bit obnoxious. And Will clenching his jaw resists becoming a father figure or even a big-brother figure with every fiber of his being. The resulting tension between them makes ""About a Boy"" a story about real people not a saccharine fairy tale. The Weitz brothers (who adapted Hornbys novel with Peter Hedges) made some changes from the book in the final third of the movie but they keep its spirit perfectly. In the end ""About a Boy"" is about a group of people finding a family -- not the picture-perfect kind but the extended urban kind. ""You need backup"" Will ultimately says to Marcus. ""About a Boy"" reminds us charmingly that we all do. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

The rich self-absorbed single guy (Hugh Grant) finds himself falling in love with a single mother (Rachel Weisz). Boys will be boys / Grant shows edge and charm as a 38-year-old growing up 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ABOUT A BOY Comedy. Starring Hugh Grant Toni Collette Rachel Weisz and Nicholas Hoult. Directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Hugh Grant is an actor with an actresslike appeal. Unlike in the case of most male stars who tend to be defined by their actions or the values they embody the fun of watching Grant is all about seeing thoughts and emotions cross and transform his face. Its a face with a range ascetic and frosty in repose mischievous and inviting when amused and always with the hint of an edge. ""About a Boy"" exploits Grants edge and much of his considerable charm in its story of a 38-year-old London bachelor who accidentally becomes entangled in the life of a 12-year-old boy. In addition to being a smart comedy and an excellent showcase for Grant its an honest movie about childhood that avoids sappiness and sentiment and goes in unexpected directions. Based on the novel by Nick Hornby the picture was directed by Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz the duo responsible for the two ""American Pie"" movies. But only a fanatical auteurist could find a connection between those films and this one. ""About a Boy"" is more reminiscent of the work of screenwriter Peter Hedges who wrote the novel ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"" and the even better follow-up ""An Ocean in Iowa"" which was told from the point of view of a little boy. Related Stories VIDEO OF THE WEEK / Growing up is hard to do / A boy and a man face world with wit Of course there are two boys in ""About a Boy"" and one of them is Will the overgrown one played by Grant. He doesnt need to work so he doesnt. He lives off the royalties from a Christmas song his father wrote in 1958 and spends his days buying CDs and watching television. He has no interest in marriage or children but spends much of his time thinking of the best ways to meet women. Grant is always funny in scenes in which he has to lie and ""About a Boy"" provides some good ones. In one scene Will is about to break up with a woman who saves him the trouble by abruptly dumping him. He suppresses his delight and pretends awkwardly to be sorry. Later he devises a scheme to meet single mothers by going to a support group and gets carried away with emotion while describing his fictitious son ""Ned."" ""About a Boy"" has lots of plot and a big cast of characters who are interrelated in complicated ways but Hedges screenplay is so economical and the Weitzes direction so graceful that we barely register this as were watching. It just unfolds like life. A troubled 12-year-old boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) attaches himself to Will and suddenly Will finds himself involved with the boy and the boys hippie-ish suicidal mother (Toni Collette). As soon as the kid emerges as a major character there is a tendency to think this is one of those movies where our hero is supposed to realize something noble probably about the joys of commitment and the triviality of his existence. But the picture doesnt fall into a predictable groove. Throughout sentiment earned and not forced is balanced by caustic humor. The kid is not a cliche or a symbol but a specific individual a boy whose neurotic helpless mother has caused him to become both self-reliant and slightly weird. We get the whole picture -- the tender but suffocating quality of the mothers affection the airless atmosphere of their cluttered apartment the outcast status at school. Nicholas Hoult plays the boy without special pleading with the matter-of-fact approach of a kid born into a situation and coping with it. Thats how the movie approaches him not as an object of pity but as just another kid with another set of problems. Its the right approach. Likewise Will is not the usual swinging bachelor found in movies. He has money but his apartment still looks seedy. He spends a lot of time unshaven in front of the television and his face is getting a little mature for his bad-boy act. Theres a blankness there. Collette as the mother is appropriately frustrating as a hard-to-reach eccentric and Rachel Weisz is vivid in what is essentially a bit part. But the movie is really about the two boys -- the big one and the little one and about how each has something the other one needs. . Advisory This film contains some strong language.

Running time 101 minutes. Rated PG-13 (nothing offensive). At the Empire the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay others. GIVEN the trajectory of the plot of ""About a Boy"" - immature selfish single man is set straight by relationship with lonely kid - its almost a miracle that this smart painfully funny adaptation of the best-selling Nick Hornby novel never gives way to sentimentality. That it doesnt dissolve into schmaltz is testament to the courage and skill of the filmmakers in retaining the caustic dialogue and keen social insight that made the book such an edgy pleasure. ""About a Boy"" is the third of the British authors books to be filmed after ""Fever Pitch"" which starred Colin Firth and the hit ""High Fidelity"" starring John Cusack which transposed the novels plot to Chicago. Though written and directed entirely by Americans and co-produced by Robert De Niros Tribeca Films the movie version of ""About a Boy"" retains the novels decidedly unglamorous London settings. And it features the improbable but triumphant casting of Hugh Grant as Will one of Hornbys perpetually adolescent ""laddish"" heroes - all of them hipper more confident and more middle-class than the floppy haired stammering upper-class heartthrobs that Grant has made a career of playing. Without Grants soft-edged charm - and superb comic timing - it would impossible to root for Will a cynical narcissistic womanizer who lacks the boyish obsessions with music and soccer that redeemed the characters played by Firth and Cusack. Will 38 and single doesnt have to work thanks to the royalties from a Christmas song written by his late father. He lives alone in a large modern flat full of shiny gadgetry and spends his days watching TV and buying CDs and designer clothes. If he has any buried ambitions or inner life hes far too cool to reveal them even to himself. One day it dawns on Will - an admitted ""selfish bastard"" - that single mothers may be the ideal sexual target for a man determined to avoid commitment. So he turns up at SPAT a support group for single parents where he pretends to be the deserted father of a 2-year-old boy. Its through a sexy Irish blonde (Victoria Smurfitt) from SPAT that Will meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) a lonely bullied but surprisingly pushy boy - whose self-involved suicidally depressed hippie mother Fiona (Toni Collette) combines overprotectiveness with total cluelessness about the world her son lives in. Marcus quickly figures out that Will is lying about his son and blackmails him into friendship. It turns out that Will has the cultural and financial wherewithal necessary to solve Marcus immediate problems. For his part Will is surprised to find himself enjoying playing Pygmalion. But then Will meets a woman he really likes (Rachel Weisz) and Fiona discovers her sons secret friendship. The screenplay by Peter Hedges with co-directors Paul and Chris Weitz (""American Pie"") makes skillful use of voice-over narrations by both Will and Marcus. Collette and Hoult both give convincing courageous performances but ""About a Boy"" is really another triumph for Grant after his cad in ""Bridget Joness Diary."" Warning After seeing this movie youll never be able to hear Roberta Flacks ""Killing Me Softly"" again without laughing.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Nick Hornby Entertainment News The loveliest movies are often the ones with a nasty kick -- pictures that dont gloss over human flaws and folly with a deadly coating of gloop but instead sculpt them into high relief so we can see exactly what were getting in a character and make our decisions about him or her with open eyes. Jean Renoir was the master of that kind of filmmaking and no contemporary director can touch him. But every once in a while in the most unlikely places you see his legacy carried out in a bright and original way. Every now and then a picture reminds you how easy and pleasurable it is to love mankind -- once youve come to terms with the fact that its wholly wretched. Love is all around in ""About a Boy"" but its tucked into the nooks and crannies between wicked wisecracks cruel-to-be-kind words and lots of eye-rolling. The movie doesnt so much envelop us in love as kick us in the butt with it sending us on our way feeling awake and alive and a little bruised. Sometimes love hurts; other times it just smarts. When you have to describe the plot of ""About a Boy"" in 25 words or less you say its about an immature lout who learns how to be a grown-up by befriending an odd little boy -- which is essentially true although it makes the story (as told in both the movie and the Nick Hornby novel its based on) sound much gloppier than it is like ""A Christmas Carol"" crossed with ""Peter Pan."" More specifically ""About a Boy"" is about the way human beings trade information and observations and feelings with one another and about how others can sometimes make you see your way toward being the person you didnt even know you wanted to be. Its also about the ways parents unwittingly cripple their own children with their love even by doing something as seemingly small as making them wear a goofy sweater to school. When parents tell their children (as they rightly should) ""Individuality is wonderful Embrace it"" its sometimes their own individuality theyre championing after having firmly imprinted it on their kids. Without being churlish or mean ""About a Boy"" shows us how hard it is for parents to grow up too suggesting that letting your child become his or her own person might be the final and most important (not to mention the most difficult) act of shedding your own childhood. Hornbys novel is sweet if slight and eminently enjoyable as a pop-culture snapshot. Its also an honest rumination on the way material goods as expressions of our own personal style sometimes have a value far beyond their actual cost. But while Hornbys characters were sharply drawn his story was diffuse and meandering. The movie directed by the team that gave us ""American Pie"" Paul and Chris Weitz captures the essence of Hornbys story and sharpens the edges Its faster and funnier and sleeker than the book and its distinctive stylization really makes Hornbys ideas gel. The Weitzes ""About a Boy"" moves along swiftly swerving and curving around every obvious pothole; the directors take care of every detail without spelling out the obvious for us. For once were simply left to use our intelligence and wits as the story unfolds before us. That should be the rule and not the exception in mainstream movies yet it has become increasingly rare. ""About a Boy"" is as close to mainstream perfection as Ive seen all year. It gives us everything we want need and deserve without batting an eye. Hugh Grant plays Will a spoiled arrested adolescent who doesnt have to work because his dad wrote a hit Christmas song years ago; the royalties keep rolling in as sure as December keeps rolling around. (When a prospective girlfriend asks him with wide-eyed curiosity if even door-to-door carolers need to pay for the privilege of singing ""Santas Super Sleigh"" Will responds tartly and at least half-seriously ""They should actually but you cant always catch up with the bastards."") Will has a slick London apartment loaded with lots of cool toys and nothing to do but fill his days with TV watching pool playing and hunting around for women whom hell date for a while and then unceremoniously dump. After a friend hooks him up with a recently divorced single mom he realizes hes hit the jackpot Single mothers are exceedingly grateful for every bit of attention shown them which makes them much less demanding than your ordinary garden-variety girlfriend. To meet more of these spectacular creatures Will invents a child for himself and attends a meeting of a local single-parents group called SPAT for Single Parents Alone Together. Thats how he eventually comes to meet 11-year-old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) the shuffling Peruvian-knit-sweater-wearing child of a perennially depressed arrested hippie and music therapist Fiona (Toni Collette). To call Marcus an awkward kid is an understatement At school even the little Pakistani computer nerds the lowest fishies in the schoolyard pond inform him solemnly that he cant hang out with them anymore. We know the kids really in trouble when we see his mother her ethnic earrings dangling cheerfully in cruel contrast with her dour tear-stained face sprinkling the morning breakfast cereal into bowls Its called Ancient Grains. It takes forever for Will to warm up to Marcus which is one of the great joys of ""About a Boy"" Any transformation thats going to stick cant be easy so we relish the long stretched-out moments in which Will finds dozens of ways to tell Marcus to buzz off. Their friendship isnt a sudden click; its more of a gradual erosion the sort of thing that eventually turns beach glass back into sand with Marcus doing the grinding. The evolution of their friendship is charted cleverly in a montage that shows Marcus day after day after day ringing Wills doorbell after school and plopping himself down on the couch despite Wills obvious protestations as if it were the worlds most eminently reasonable act. You Might Also Like Marcus isnt immediately lovable Hes as weird and annoying to us as he is to Will with his assertively all-wrong clothes and his tendency to blurt out the lyrics of soppy 70s songs at inappropriate times. But as Marcus is written (the screen adaptation of Hornbys book is by Peter Hedges) and even more important as Hoult plays him you cant help warming to him. Marcus walk a kind of flat-footed shuffle in which his legs move independently from his rigid torso at first represents everything about him thats closed off and fearful By the movies end you see it as something different a natural trait that somehow matches how open and funny and free this kid is. Hoult with his devilishly unkempt eyebrows and cherubically too-red lips plays one of those pre-teens who still looks too much like his mothers little boy and your heart goes out to him -- Hoult doesnt try to grab it from you as so many child actors do. Collette as Fiona has an even tougher job Here in the early 2000s we all recognize that its perfectly acceptable to laugh at hippies who just cant let go of their security ponchos. Collette actually invites us to; indeed how can we avoid it when Fiona shows up for a lunch date with Will in a hairy monstrosity of a sweater that Will later characterizes as a ""Yeti costume""? But Collette also pulls off the more difficult feat of making us feel something for her every step of the way. Fiona is suicidal but even though were aware of her pain we also see how much it hurts Marcus. (""I feel better now"" she says simply beaming calmly at him after she returns from a stay at a mental hospital as if his loneliness and confusion were mere accessories to her own smoothed-over feelings.) Collette forces us to acknowledge both Fionas suffering and her selfishness a tricky line to walk. She bounces brilliantly off Grants Will whose annoyance with her boils into frustration and then full-blown rage when he confronts her with the ways in which shes ""made"" Marcus so weird. ""You daft fucking hippie"" he hurls at her and the line is as funny as it is cruel and weirdly poignant. Grant who used to hide far too coyly behind his public-schoolboy stammer and floppy forelock has turned into a marvelously unself-conscious actor. Hes best when hes playing a bit of a bastard The evil glimmer in his eyes when he spied Renee Zellwegers giant granny underpants in ""Bridget Joness Diary"" was one of the sexiest things Ive seen at the movies in years. Grants also an incredibly game actor He gives it the full throttle in his inimitably understated way when he explains to two of his sunshiney new-parent friends that he cant possibly be their infants godfather because hell only be trying to put the make on her when she turns 18. Its a hilarious moment but even more remarkable is the way Grants resolute orneriness meshes with the person he becomes later in the movie. When Will notices that Marcus is wearing the dorkiest shoes on planet Earth he buys him cool new trainers -- Will is grimly determined that the shoes will be what helps this kid through the roughest years of his life and in a roundabout way hes right. Grant is wonderful here because he recognizes that a character can soften without turning into a marshmallow. Hes also I have to note aging beautifully He has never looked as handsome as he does here. Those few inklings of crows feet are the best thing that could have happened to his impishly good-looking face. Every performance in ""About a Boy"" moves naturally and beautifully in concert with the others. Its a movie that works on every level starting at its very core. Its the movie the Weitzes were destined to make. They arent known as subtle directors although they should be ""American Pie"" at first written off as a shallow teen gross-out comedy has actually found an audience that sees its larger value; for one thing no teen movie since ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" has shown so much sensitivity toward teenage girls in the face of boys sexual cloddishness. The Weitzes second feature ""Down to Earth"" didnt resonate as clearly but was nonetheless wrongly overlooked Its a sweet-natured and well-made entertainment. But neither picture comes together as wholly as ""About a Boy."" Its apparent lightness is actually many-layered The Weitzes are masters at playing two (or more often many) emotions off one another at once. When we see Fiona and Marcus gathered round their tinkly home piano belting out a rousing and stupendously earnest rendition of ""Killing Me Softly"" we wince just as Will does. Then just as it does with Will our vague amusement at the ridiculousness of it all transmutes into something like horror. And yet even as were howling with laughter at them its impossible to feel derision -- their belief in the power of this lousy song transcends its innate crappiness and we see them and the bond between them as something inherently wonderful despite its corny trappings. Thats a pretty subtle thing for two directors best known for a movie in which a teenager humps a piece of pastry to pull off. But then ""About a Boy"" is all about the process of becoming something that no one least of all yourself ever thought you could be. The Weitzes have topped themselves and their movie is an invitation to us to tap the better parts of our nature without resorting to cheap self-congratulation. The not-so-secret message of ""About a Boy"" is that people are bastards. And bastards are so much easier to love than saints. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment.

"A Perfect Balance Of Sweet And Tart - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Hugh Grant A Perfect Balance Of Sweet And TartMovies - REVIEW - About a BoyHugh Grant And Newcomer Nicholas Hoult Bolster Flavor Of Coming-of-age Film.May 17 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticYou have to hand it to Hugh Grant for figuring out how to bounce back from a scandal.Instead of playing the sort of nice unassuming bumbling guys he has played in films like Four Weddings and a Funeral he has lately taken to playing charming cads. In the engaging new comedy About a Boy as in last years Bridget Joness Diary he uses our residual negative feelings about him to help flesh out his character.This time he is Will a handsome and witty but shockingly shallow 38-year-old Londoner. Will himself will tell you hes shallow. He will in fact insist upon it.The thing about Will is he has never had to worry about anything. His late father once wrote a novelty song -- ""Santas Super Sleigh"" -- that became so phenomenally popular that Will can live off the royalties in high style.So he spends his days (and nights) indulging himself an endeavor that includes dating a seemingly endless series of women.Theres only one problem. Whenever he gets tired of one of them and wants to break up she blames him and starts to cry.Even Wills shell of shallowness cant protect him from feeling uncomfortable about that.Then one day he stumbles upon what he thinks is a solution when his latest girlfriend turns out to be a single mom. Just as hes about to break up with her she breaks up with him. Taking care of her child is so consuming she says that she doesnt have time to focus on their romance.As far as Will is concerned this is great. The relationship ends and he isnt blamed.This experience gives Will the idea to always date single mothers. And so to this end he joins S.P.A.T. -- Single Parents Alone Together.Its through this support group that he meets Marcus an adolescent misfit and the child of a neurotic single mother. If Will is immature Marcus is too mature. His mothers emotional problems have forced him to grow up too fast.Marcus has begun to realize that as much as he loves his mother he cant depend on her exclusively. He needs an extended family and he picks Will as a key member.But can a man as shallow as Will grow up enough to become the sort of surrogate father that Marcus clearly needs?Like High Fidelity (2000) About a Boy is a sophisticated comedy based on a novel by Nick Hornby. Paul and Chris Weitz who co-directed and with Peter Hedges co-wrote the film are best known for the sex-with-pastry comedy American Pie.Who would have guessed that they had a film as heartfelt and well grown-up in them? Their comic touch is so light this time that they might have called the film British Souffle.The movies sweet-and-tart flavor brings to mind the comedies of Billy Wilder especially The Apartment as well as early Jonathan Demme. In fact the new films goofy Christmas song recalls the similarly goofy ""Santas Souped-Up Sleigh"" in Demmes Melvin and Howard.A lot of the credit for the films winning tone must go to Grant who hasnt lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the Atlantic love him. Looking lean and contentedly self-absorbed his character sports a spikey ""carefully disheveled"" haircut and is disarmingly forthright about his failings.Early in the film when close friends ask Will to be the godfather of their young daughter he thanks them sincerely for the honor but patiently explains that hes the absolute worst choice they could possibly make. He even predicts that on the girls 18th birthday hed probably take her out get her drunk and then attempt to ""shag"" her.The supporting cast truly does lend support.As Fiona Marcus mother Toni Collette (Changing Lanes) is heart-breakingly fragile. Every time Fiona looks at her son with her big needy eyes its as if she never expects to see him again. (Its not him shes mainly worried about; its herself. As much as she loves the boy she doesnt know how much more of this life she can take.)Also impressive is Rachel Weisz (the Mummy films) who brings a distinctive intelligence to the thankless role of ""love interest.""As young Marcus newcomer Nicholas Hoult is the heart of the film and a big open heart he is. Moon-faced and adorned with winged other-worldly eyebrows hes the kid that all the other kids -- even the other outcasts -- shun.The more we get to know Marcus the more we like him. All his problems stem from a mother who loves him well but unwisely She shouts her love across the schoolyard clueless that that is a sure-fire strategy for the enduring ridicule of her son.About a Boy is a coming-of-age film in which the person with the least growing up to do is a kid. If it sounds at all sentimental thats only because it superficially resembles other films that are.You have to remember that those other films didnt have the blithely superficial Hugh Grant at their center. The antidote to sentimentality he isnt deep enough to be sappy.

"Enthusiastic Not Mad About the Boy - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie Review Enthusiastic Not Mad About the BoyThe Hugh Grant comedy About a Boy based on the Nick Hornby novel is endearing but could have been so much more.May 17 2002|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES STAFF WRITER Its no use pretending ""About a Boy"" doesnt have warmth and charm because it does. But denial is tempting because its also clear that were meant to like this Hugh Grant-starring human comedy more than we actually do. Thats because theres a potential for something better still that never manages to get realized.Much of the success the film has is because of its underlying source material a wonderful comic novel by Britains Nick Hornby one of the deftest writers around whose earlier ""High Fidelity"" was the basis of the exceptional film starring John Cusack.But even without that Stephen Frears-directed example of how to do Hornby right its not difficult to see where this satisfying film directed (and written along with Peter Hedges) by brothers Paul Weitz amp; Chris Weitz comes up shorter than wed like.Though they also did the forgettable ""Down to Earth"" the Weitzes are best known for their debut film ""American Pie"" which brought more humanity and sharpness to the teenage gross-out genre than anyone anticipated. But with ""About a Boy"" which comes burdened with the expectations of four major production entities (Universal Studio Canal Tribeca and Working Title) the reverse has happened.Instead of adding to unpromising material the Weitzes have ended up softening promising stuff subtly homogenizing and mainstreaming a deceptively quirky scenario. They were doubtless attracted to the projects honesty and style and hoped to do it justice but their beats are mostly standard ones and they intuitively head for the middle of the road.Although ""About a Boy"" has a lot to recommend it compared with much of what emanates from the studios even its best points come with asterisks attached.Its star Grant is a case in point. He plays one of a pair of unlikely protagonists the pointedly named Will Freeman a self-centered London single guy whos never had a real job or a relationship that lasted longer than two months. Living on the royalties of a hugely popular song written by his late father he considers being his nieces godfather way too much responsibility and protests mightily whenever people see any depth in him proclaiming ""I really am this shallow.""The script gives Will a series of great voice-over riffs from his insistence that he for one is a man who is an island to his determination to be the star of the Will Show which is definitely not an ensemble drama. Grant handles them expertly but though he is a born blithe spirit as an actor he has too much likability for us to buy him as callow and distant.""About a Boys"" plot begins with Wills discovery of attention-starved single moms as perfect dating prey. He makes up a 2-year-old son named Ned and goes to meetings of the wonderfully named SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) where he meets the attractive Suzie (Victoria Smurfit). On their first date she brings along Marcus the 12-year-old son of one of her friends.As it happens the film has already introduced Marcus. Hes the co-protagonist the son of Fiona (Toni Collette who can be anyone and do it well) aptly described by Will as a ""daft hippie.""But although his mother burdened with depression serious enough to make her suicidal doesnt know it Marcus is tortured at school by sadistic peers and has accepted his lot as ""one of the people who doesnt have a good time in life.""As Marcus Nicholas Hoult whos been a working actor since he was 8 is rather good in a wise-beyond-his-years way but once again he seems to be more a practiced Hollywood version of a weird kid than he needs to be.The thrust of ""About a Boy"" is how Will through his association with Marcus is dragged kicking and screaming into the human race how he discovers that life without meaning is well meaningless.Because a gradually thawing Will plays more to Grants strengths the second part of the film helped as well by Rachel Weisz as a love interest is much more fun. But it is still hard not to feel that this film is pushing us too hard slickly trying to seem more honest than it actually is.Its not giving anything away to say that the last shot of ""About a Boy"" is someones broadly beaming happy face. Its not that the film shouldnt have a happy ending; though the books closing section is quite different it is definitely upbeat. But reducing everything to a happy face is more simplistic and more typically Hollywood than this material deserves.MPAA rating PG-13 for brief strong language and some thematic elements. Times guidelines relatively mild material suitable for young teen audiences.About a BoyHugh Grant...WillNicholas Hoult...MarcusToni Collette...FionaRachel Weisz...RachelUniversal Pictures and StudioCanal present a Tribeca/Working Title production released by Universal.

It is. Adapted by the Brothers Weitz - Paul and Chris the American siblings of American Pie fame - the film is a sharp funny touching tale of a late-30s London narcissist who discovers by various comic and not-so-comic turns the real-life grown-up pleasures of companionship friendship family and gulp even love.Will is played by Grant with a controversial coif (Ive already witnessed two animated debates about the stars About a Boy haircut) and great chunks of Hornby-writ voice-over narration. Hes a laddish bachelor who lives comfortably off the royalties of a cheesy Christmas song penned by his late dad. Keen on sex music and TV game shows Will fills his days with pop-cult consumerist distractions. Although he doesnt work he approaches his daily routines of shopping eating and lying-about with the same sense of precision and purpose as the most dedicated workaholic.For dating as About a Boy begins Will has come up with a great scam He joins a support group of single parents (SPAT - Single Parents Alone Together) and hits on Suzie (Victoria Smurfit) the prettiest mother there. Of course to do so he has fabricated an elaborate fiction about his own kid going so far as to buy a childs seat for his car (and sprinkling it with crumbs for that authentic lived-in look). Although things dont exactly work out with Suzie its through her that he eventually meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) the awkward bullied 12-year-old son of Suzies best friend Fiona (Toni Collette).The bond that develops between Will and Marcus - the immature guarded commitment-free adult and the emotionally-out-there sullen kid - is at the heart of About a Boy. The sequences in which a determined Marcus with his Beatle moptop his Mr. Spock eyebrows and the hippie garb foisted on him by his flaky mum stalks the standoffish Will are as sweet and winning as they are comically perverse. (Hoult is an unprecocious pre-adolescent natural.) Despite Wills strongest distaste for and distrust of ""meaningful"" relationships - thats exactly what happens in this strange mixture of age-skewed pal-ship and surrogate father-son-ship.Which brings the story around to Rachel (Rachel Weisz) another single mom with a 12-year-old boy of her own. To get to know Rachel better Will recruits Marcus to act out being his son. Another lie and things go awry.Fans of the Hornby book should be pleased by the Weitzes smart faithful translation (a more successful job than the John Cusack-starring version of Hornbys High Fidelity) although sacrifices have been made (the drama with Ellie Marcus punky schoolmate love object has been whittled down). And things threaten to turn uncharacteristically mushy in a school concert scene thats as close to a Hollywood moment as this movie gets.Still small complaints for a film that is easily the best brightest thing out there right now.Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.About a Boy  1/2 (Out of four stars)Produced by Jane Rosenthal Robert De Niro Brad Epstein Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner directed by Paul and Chris Weitz written by Peter Hedges and the Weitzes photography by Remi Adefarasin music by Badly Drawn Boy distributed by Universal Pictures.Running time 1 hour 40 mins.Will. . .

(Often they retain it to the point that they feel locked into it.) The Hugh Grant who stars as a rakishly self-centered bachelor in About a Boy however is a very different animal from the sweetly abashed overgrown schoolboy who pined and stammered his way through Four Weddings and a Funeral and then in an even more remarkable performance drew on the same charmed tizzy of will-somebody-please- toss-me-a-life-jacket distress when he appeared on The Tonight Show to apologize for his naughty offscreen behavior. That earlier Hugh Grant was a walking contradiction - an uptight dreamboat held hostage by the very manners that lent him such an endearingly civilized sex appeal. He was anxious to the point of pain yet also terribly touchingly sincere. He may have been the last leading man who could get away with acting like a nervous wreck. The first thing you notice about Grant in About a Boy is that he looks older. The second thing you notice is that it looks good on him. The pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn and the eyes that used to peer with ""love me"" cuteness now betray a sharks casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess) but its not just his surface thats more virile; the nervousness is gone too. Hugh Grant has grown up holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so he has blossomed into the rare actor who can play a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency. In About a Boy Grant draws on and deepens his enjoyable performance as the seducer boss in Bridget Joness Diary to play a new species of highly self-aware cad. His character Will Freeman is a London womanizer who is in the absurd if enviable position of not having to work. He lives off the royalties from ""Santas Super Sleigh"" a Christmas jingle composed by his late father and this leaves him free to pursue his grand passions watching TV watching videos playing ""sports"" (i.e. billiards) and chasing women he has not the slightest intention of settling down with. About a Boy is based on the 1998 novel by Nick Hornby and with Grant reciting Wills acid thoughts to us in voice-over (its hilarious to see him confront his friends young child and then hear what Will really thinks about the situation) the movie sticks much closer to Hornbys drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of High Fidelity did. Will in a sense is lying to everyone he meets because the secret of his life is that he belongs quite contentedly to a club of one. Hes the ultimate refinement of the modern bachelor slicing his time like a male Bridget Jones into units (haircut two units; sports three units) to be filled however his pleasure dictates. That is until he gets the bright idea of scoring a date by infiltrating a support group for single parents and pretending to be one of them himself. Through complications arising from this charade he is drawn into the lives of Megan (Toni Collette) a not-so-ex-hippie with a chip on her shoulder as heavy as her depression and Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) her 12-year-old son whos a sensitive outcast at school. Actually the on-the-make Will wants nothing to do with these two. (He wants to date Megans neighbor.) But when Megan is rushed to the hospital after a failed suicide attempt he finds himself in the grudging position of playing comrade to the isolated boy. Each day Marcus comes over and rings the doorbell and hes in such dire need of an authority figure who isnt a basket case that Will with nothing but time on his hands takes pity on him and starts to occupy the role. Theres a certain dampening of excitement when you realize that About a Boy isnt going to be a contempo Alfie but rather one of those movies like Big Daddy in which a screwup is redeemed by his camaraderie with a kid. Yet part of the pictures funky sweetness is that codirectors Paul and Chris Weitz aiming a bit higher than they did in American Pie do more than transform Will from a trampy hedonist into a nice guy. They trace the careful step-by-step process through which compassion starts to feel more real to him than his shiny empty mirror of a life did. The title of course refers to both of the main characters. If Grant himself has rarely seemed less boyish newcomer Hoult who looks like an enthusiastic owl creates the most touchingly unguarded edge-of-adolescence nerd in ages. It would have been nice if the big school- performance scene at the end were as inspiring a heart- tugger as it wants to be. Alas its a mixture of the heroic and the embarrassing in no small part because the sight of Hugh Grant singing ""Killing Me Softly"" a song thats perfectly respectable to like turns out to be not nearly as sublime as Grant reciting the lyrics to ""I Think I Love You"" a song that gets no respect whatsoever. For a moment the new Hugh Grant made me miss the old one.

"About a Boy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; about-a-boy ) About a Boy (United Kingdom/United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Talk about an unenviable task... Universal Pictures has chosen About a Boy to be a sacrificial lamb electing to open it on May 17 opposite Attack of the Clones. Maybe theyre hoping that movie-goers disappointed by sell-outs at the latest Star Wars sequel will buy a ticket to this movie. Or maybe its counter-programming although the desire to see the Star Wars movies cuts across racial class gender and generational boundaries. Its too bad that the distributor has matched About a Boy against such an undefeatable opponent - this movie is deserving of more exposure than its likely to get. It may not be a ""must-see"" blockbuster but its better than a lot of what passes for summer entertainment. The films pedigree is impressive. The producers (Tim Bevan Eric Fellner) are the men who sat in a similar chair for Bridget Joness Diary. The writer of the novel upon which About a Boy is based (Nick Hornby) is responsible for the source material for High Fidelity. And the directors came into prominence by doing unspeakable things to desserts in American Pie. Add to that the always-appealing Hugh Grant and the gorgeous Rachel Weisz and is it possible to go wrong? If About a Boy is anything to go by the answer is no. Using a stock plot About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater. Theres nothing terribly challenging or original about the production but it boasts nicely rounded amiable characters a fairly consistent sense of self-deprecating wit and the occasional belly laugh. We grow to care about the protagonists which is critical in this sort of outing and the Weitzes manage the difficult task of making the big climax satisfying while at the same time they avoid pushing it over the top to the point where it becomes overly sentimental claptrap. Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) is the ultimate slacker. Living off the royalties of his one-hit-wonder fathers Christmastime jingle ""Santas Supersleigh"" Will is proud of never having had a job or indeed having done much of anything. Hes not interested in a serious relationship - casual sex and one-night stands are his fortA(c). Then one day he makes a mistake. On the prowl for easy female prey he ventures into a single parents group meeting. Soon he is dating a woman who is babysitting for her friends son Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). This wouldnt mean much to Will except that Marcus takes a liking to him and decides that Will might be the perfect match for his emotionally disturbed mother Fiona (Toni Collette). Then the strangest thing happens - Will and Marcus strike up an unusual friendship. But complications ensue when Will falls for another single mother (Rachel Weisz) and wants Marcus to pretend to be his son. Depending on your preference About a Boy can fall into one of two categories. The most obvious one is the older man-meets-young boy-and-both-teach-each-other-life-lessons grouping. The film could also be seen as a coming-of-age story since at the beginning Will is essentially stuck in a state of perpetual adolescence and his interaction with Marcus gives him a perspective on life that he never previously had. Suddenly his isolated insular lifestyle seems shallow and superficial and even though its ""hard work to be wonderful all the time"" its worth the sacrifice. I think the key to the movies success is the slightly irreverent tone adopted by the directors. Approached from a different perspective this could have been a painfully trite and overbearing motion picture. But the Weitzes know when to wink at the audience and they employ internal monologues (for Will and Marcus) to provide biting commentary on whats going on. The movie is smart enough to avoid sit-com and movie-of-the-week situations. Hugh Grant is in rare form toeing the line between his ""aw shucks"" good guy and the cad from Bridget Joness Diary. In Will Grant gives us a character whose obvious flaws are a primary reason for his appeal. Meanwhile Nicholas Hoult shows legitimate screen presence and he and Grant generate some chemistry. Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz provide capable support. About a Boy is not a daring film but it is immensely likable. Every once in a while a movie comes along that despite traversing familiar terrain is made with enough all-around skill that it overcomes its clichA(c)d origins. About a Boy is such a movie. In a summer when pyrotechnics superheroes sequels and mindless action are sure to rule this film gives us a feel-good human story to savor between bursts of testosterone and adrenaline.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> It could have been cute to the point of cringing. Will (Hugh Grant) is a London bachelor supported by a trust fund from his songwriter dad. Will seduces single moms (because its easier) and dumps them without a twinge until a twelve-year-old misfit Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) teaches him that life can have meaning. Dont despair. Grant with his hair spiked and a wit to match is in the bastard mode of his role in Bridget Joness Diary. Hes replaced the stammering charm with something tighter meaner more self-absorbed. Its a smart move. The acid comedy of Grants performance carries the film. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> It helps also that newcomer Hoult is that rare child actor who mercifully underplays the pathos of his role. Marcus is bullied at school his hippie mom Fiona (Toni Collette) is suicidal and Will makes him pretend to be his son so he can prove his parental worth to his latest single-mom target Rachel (the excellent Rachel Weisz). Wills redemption has an assembly-line feel that the 1998 novel by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity) astutely avoided. And in updating the film from the novels early-Nineties time frame with its references to Nirvana and the death of Kurt Cobain directors Chris and Paul Weitz -- they did the funny American Pie not the fatuous sequel -- lose some edge. No matter. Grant gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.
