But were audiences clamouring to see Perry as a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Charles Bronson? Alex Cross is the profiler and hero of James Pattersons novels and is described as a guy who can tell what you ate for breakfast from 100 yards away. This sensory genius meets his match in a stimulus-seeking sociopathic narcissist killer (an emaciated lizard-like Matthew Fox) whos targeting corporate bigwigs. After Cross takes a stab at psychoanalysing him during one of their sporadic phone chats things gets personal. In drag or out of it the soft-spoken star has rarely been less convincing than when locking and loading from his home arsenal or dangling from a decaying Detroit edifice.

Perry just isnt credible as an angry Cop. He comes across as a mildy irritated customer returning beans at Tesco. Even with Matthew Fox kills his wife. In fact his laughable attempts an agry face are just that. Funny. Not in the least dramatic. There is nothing to suspend disbelief in this movie. You are always waiting for it to start. Which it never does. No suspense. No real Action. No Drama. No character development. And most annoying. No refund for having to watch it.

Freeman was too good for the material and he knew it but at least you could focus on his watchful mien and the cracked melody of his voice instead of the third-rate plotting and casual sadism. Old Freeman has moved on and theres now a ""reboot"" called simply Alex Cross. Big beefy mini-mogul Tyler Perry has climbed out of his panty hose and got some high-priced training in how to look convincing shooting a gun and beating up bad guys. Playing things straight hes a dull actor indeed with dead eyes and strange-looking pool-ball lumps in each cheek. But the movie will be a hit. It works you over as single-mindedly as its villain works over assorted young women. The bad guy is a near-superhuman assassin nicknamed ""Picasso"" because he leaves behind rather accomplished sketches of victims past and future. Hes icy but enjoys inflicting pain. Cross theorizes the man is ""ex-military and a sociopathic narcissist ... He wants them to suffer -- his mother his father himself the world ... "" Picasso is played by a wiry but startlingly emaciated Matthew Fox who Id like to think starved himself as penance for the conclusion of Lost (second only to the new Battlestar Galactica in the ""I spent years mulling over every bit of minutiae for this bullshit? competition). Picasso paralyzes a woman and then tortures her to death and there are plenty of shots (and glossies posted in the detectives headquarters) of her wide-eyed corpse but theres no blood and the naughty bits are tastefully covered so the movie is rated PG-13. Perry is a big believer in God and family values so amid the carnage are solemn church scenes and shots of grieving children. Director Rob Cohen developed an exciting syntax in the first Fast and Furious movie. Here he brings off some jolting effects in the fight sequences (mixed boxing wrestling and martial artists) with a hand-held camera -- the filmmaking equivalent of ""fighting dirty"" but in a good way. That said its impossible to respect a director whod get onboard with material this bludgeoning. I probably spend too much time reading the likes of Lawrence Block (also given to sadistic violence) and Michael Connelly but Patterson and his assembly line of co-writers are the bottom of the barrel. From Wikipedia ""Alex [Cross] has had bad luck with women. His wife was murdered. His lover in Along Came a Spider Jezzie Flanigan is involved in the kidnapping of two children for which she is executed by lethal injection. His fiancee Christine Johnson was kidnapped for almost a year by Geoffrey Shafer. An FBI agent with whom he had been partnered Betsey Cavalierre was murdered by a serial killer called The Mastermind ... "" To paraphrase Oscar Wilde to lose one woman may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose four or more looks like your creator is a sick fuck. Maybe the most upsetting part of my evening was after Id left the theater. Behind me an older mother (African-American) was thanking her son for taking her. ""A lot of movies today you just dont know about"" she said. ""But this was a good one."" Thats the Tyler Perry touch. Alex Cross is coarse punishing and in all the ways that matter conscienceless but its about a loving father and husband versus a deviant and it makes the right pious noises on the subject of revenge. When Crosss Granny (Cicely Tyson alas) says that if Alex does what she thinks hes going to do (i.e. his job hunting down an assassin and serial murderer) then ""how you gonna look your children in the eye?"" he replies ""I will meet his soul at the gates of hell before I will let him take another person from me that I love."" Thats what you call a non-dilemma. And what does Cross do thats so nasty? The kind of extreme interrogation of an unambiguous scumbag drug chemist that would get him laughed out of Guantanamo as a pussy. What a whorish film this is Even the serial killer lectures the detective quoting Confucius ""Before you embark on a journey of revenge dig two graves."" But turning the other cheek would mean death at the box office which is the only kind of grave that matters in this moral universe.

Sure theoretically. But Tyler Perrys performance in Alex Cross isnt the place to find out. The movie -- a roughly assembled roots story about the fictional homicide detective/genius psychologist created by blockbuster novelist James Patterson and more memorably played by Morgan Freeman in Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls -- is so cloddish slapdash gracelessly written and visually fugly that its difficult to distinguish Perrys limitations in the role from those of the whole unpleasant enterprise. Working with his partner and best pal since childhood (played by Ed Burns given tinny dialogue and delivering it with grating Irish-from-the-hood swagger) Cross is after a psycho serial killer the cops call Picasso because of the cubist charcoal drawings he leaves behind after hes done torturing his victims. (Special torture is reserved for women because?well because this is a sick slick pandering genre where whats creepy enough on the page looks positively exploitative on screen.) Played by a skinny yet shredded Matthew Fox with a lot of bug-eyed facial activity and a showy display of actorish physical tics Picasso clearly has a methodical agenda in mind and its up to Cross (along with his hey-dude-wait-for-me sidekick) to figure out what makes those tics tick. (One of Picassos intended targets appears to be a mega-rich international industrialist played by Jean Reno with smarm bordering on that of late-stage Gerard Depardieu.) And then throwing Crisco on the fire the villains evil also spreads to the heros personal life. Were meant to like Cross even more when hes angry. In fact theres no incentive to care about any of it -- not the chase not the lurid action sequences not the perfunctory sprinkling of Cross family togetherness scenes and homilies about love and devotion thrown in as a reminder that Perrys core audience knows him best as the softball preacher who produced material like Madeas Family Reunion and Why Did I Get Married? In the face of such junk the idea that Fox would proudly put himself on a punishing regime of severe diet and exercise to get prisoner-skinny-yet-crazy-muscled for the job of make-believe is vanity at best obscenity at worst.

At area theaters Move over Morgan Freeman. Back off Madea. Tyler Perry -- the man who built a mini-empire in Atlanta in part because of his frock-wearing gun-toting police defying signature character -- is expanding his reach as an actor. Based on the character created by blockbuster author James Patterson ""Alex Cross"" aims to reboot the crime-thriller franchise that featured Freeman as FBI psychologist Cross in ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider."" This Perry character wont be having run ins with the cops. He is the ""popo."" And while Cross remains cerebral hes more than willing to open up a can of whupp er you get the picture. How successful this relaunch is will depend more on the draw of the unexpected combination of Perry and Patterson than on the sputtering fumes of this familiar tale. Director Rob Cohen of ""XXX"" and ""The Fast and Furious"" tends to be more interested in action than acting and it shows. Hes left a fairly capable ensemble working hard to little even laughable effect. Perrys not bad but hes given himself better direction than hes gets from Cohen. ""Alex Cross"" provides the backstory of how Dr. Cross landed at Quantico. Here the Detroit cop works alongside best friend and partner Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) and officer Monica Ashe (Rachel Nichols). He lives with his lovely wife Maria (Carmen Ejogo) their two children and his mother. Legendary actress Cicely Tyson has made the sojourn from Perrys faith-based movies to this occasionally godawful flick as his wise no-nonsense mother. At the start of the film Cross is beating his wife at a guessing game they play. Hes the ""guy who can tell youve had scrambled eggs for breakfast at 100 yards"" is how partner and childhood friend describes him. His one misjudgment will cost him dearly. One of the biggest hurdles for Dr. Alex Cross is that since he was last on screen TV has been feeding audiences a steady diet of FBI profilers and forensically skilled agents who track nasty perverse tricky arrogant -- shall we go on? -- serial killers. Theres little new here to compete with a ""Criminal Minds"" marathon. As the killer dubbed Picasso Matthew Fox (Dr. Jack Shephard of ""Lost"") is also cast against type. Hes a gaunt sinewy charcoal sketching tormentor. He likes to keep his victims immobilized but aware while doing them lethal harm. The film carries a PG-13 rating. The language is reined in. The violence is more implied than bloodletting. Still there are a few harsh even exploitative scenes especially Picassos seductive tryst with his first victim a high-flying exec named Fan Yau (Stephanie Jacobsen). She works for the an industrialist Giles Mercier (Jean Reno) whom Cross believes to be the real target of the killer. The businessman has a plans to rebuild Detroit -- and he too fears hes the intended victim. Red herrings are doled out like chum. Giancarlo Esposito makes a cameo as slick crime boss Daramus Holiday. Cross plays chess at a jail with Holidays young cousin Pop Pop still in pigtails and wearing prison orange jumpsuit. And the writers leave a breadcrumb the size of a baguette at the start of Picassos murders. That Picasso appears to be an assassin on a slightly different mission than your garden-variety serial killer doesnt get adequately addressed. For a franchise with an off-the-charts nuanced thinker as its protagonist ""Alex Cross"" isnt very smart.

Kinda. Sidney Baldwin The new thriller ""Alex Cross"" tries hard to erase any memories of Madea and quickly reinvents the onscreen Tyler Perry as a hardworking husband loving father and all-around tough-guy action hero. But hed better hold onto that dress -- just in case. Perry of course is a hugely successful director -- although his dramatic ""For Colored Girls"" felt more like one of his plays than Ntozake Shanges hes created an empire of film comedies and sitcoms. But as an actor he just doesnt seem to exist outside of drag. Putting on that wig and those earrings seems to be the only key he has to a charm and confidence he otherwise keeps locked away. In ""Alex Cross"" hes playing the hero from the James Patterson best-sellers about an FBI agent and psychologist who often tangles with serial killers. In this story -- which moves the action to Detroit and takes place while Cross is still working for the police -- hes after ""Picasso"" an artistic type who likes to torture his victims to death and seems to be targeting some very influential people. But although Perry talks tough and (improbably) engages in some strenuous foot chases and knockdown fistfights theres nothing charismatic about the big round-faced actor here nothing to make us believe in his character or care about him. Hulking but still unimpressive he looks like one of those football players who used to wander in and out of old Bob Hope TV specials. Why are we watching this guy youd wonder. Whats he famous for again? Because hes clearly not an actor. Nor is Rob Cohen much of a director. Most of his previous films have been built around mummies dragons Vin Diesel and other mythological creatures; forced to rely more on plot and character than special effects hes at a loss. So we have a film that is crammed full of cliches (the tough-talking police chief the snobbish German billionaire the dragon-lady temptress) and stuffed full of over-the-top action (slam-bam car chases things blowing up and plenty of creepy violence against women). And yet the whole thing remains strangely empty. Edward Burns who has been playing laconic Irish-American cops for years largely whenever he needs money to make one of his own indies picks up a check. And Matthew Fox chews the scenery as a crazed whippet-thin psychopath on the run. But this is supposed to be Perrys movie (and a reboot of a franchise that started out a decade ago with the very different Morgan Freeman). Perrys supposed to be its center. And as an actor -- certainly as a movie star -- hes absolutely nowhere to be found. Ratings note The film contains violence sexual situations strong language and drug references. Alex Cross (PG-13) Summit (101 min.) Directed by Rob Cohen. With Tyler Perry Matthew Fox. Now playing in New Jersey.

"Alex Cross review Madea would not be thrilled | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAlex Cross review Madea would not be thrilledTyler Perry finds it easier to step out of Madeas dress than into Morgan Freemans shoes in the thriller Alex Cross a trite attempt at franchise building.Tyler Perry left plays the title character and Matthew Fox his fearsome nemesis in Alex Cross.  (Sidney Baldwin / MCT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 19 2012Alex Cross (out of 4)Starring Tyler Perry Edward Burns Matthew Fox and Jean Reno. Directed by Rob Cohen. 101 minutes. Opens Oct. 19 at major theatres. 14ATyler Perry finds it easier to step out of Madeas dress than into Morgan Freemans shoes in the thriller Alex Cross a trite attempt at franchise building.The resourceful Perry has gone about as far as he can go with the dress-up antics of his Madea series as witness the under-performance of the recent Madeas Witness Protection.Article Continued BelowHe seeks renewal via the title role of Dr. Alex Cross a forensic detective with the Detroit Police who could out-sleuth Sherlock Holmes and whom the FBI is eager to hire.Featured in 17 novels by James Patterson Cross has been brought to the screen twice before by Morgan Freeman whose soulful presence made Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider seem much better films than they actually were.No such magic this time in this lumpy saga of a rampaging psycho torturer (Losts Matthew Fox) who needs to be brought to ground especially when the stakes turn personal.Perrys ambition is admirable but he simply doesnt have the acting chops to pull off a character as complicated as Cross who is sketched as a deductive genius a loving family man a vengeful antihero and a genuine action figure. Hes too mild by half in all of these departments apart from the family guy stuff.The screenplay by Mark Moss and Kerry Williamson does little to establish Crosss almost supernatural ability to delve into the mind of the artistic creep who becomes known as ""Picasso"" for the abstract clues he leaves at murder scenes. The sadistic Picasso is apparently targeting affluent Detroiters for sicko thrills (""Im fascinated by pain"") rather than any Robin Hood motives. Theres also little help for Perry from director Rob Cohen whose action credits range from the very good The Fast and the Furious to the not-so-good XXX. Cohens eye this time is blurred and dimmed.The shameless proclivity of plugs for GM and Ford products and the Cleveland shoot for many Detroit locales suggests there wasnt a whole lot of money available for extra takes or for stunt men to convincingly sub for the beefy Perry in the erratic and unconvincing fight scenes.But Perry himself may be to blame for the films overemphasis on the home his natural domain. From the nursery cooing of Crosss wife (Carmen Ejogo) to the righteous bluster of his ""Nana Mama"" (Cicely Tyson) the movie often thuds to a halt for the detectives domestic highs and lows.The family emphasis also short-sheets the relationship between Cross and Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) his crime-busting partner and childhood pal. The pairing shows early promise yet ultimately fizzles out. Burns at least has some sort of presence unlike Jean Reno whose industrialist Giles Mercier is more rickety than the foundations of the Detroit buildings he seeks to transform. (One major plot turn trades off the sad decrepitude of a major Detroit landmark.)The actor most invested in the film is Fox whose truly scary Picasso deserves a sharper pursuer and a smarter script. Foxs drastic weight loss neck-cracking ferocity and wild-eyed aspect suggests he was channeling significantly darker thoughts than anyone else on the set. Perhaps he had a vision of the critical verdict on Alex Cross?

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 19 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 18 2012 201PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Rob Cohen Written by Marc Moss Kerry Williamson Starring Tyler Perry Matthew Fox Classification 14A Genre thriller Year 2012 Country USA Language English Tyler Perry tries to prove that he can do badass all by himself in Alex Cross in which the playwright-turned-king-of-all-media is cast as a police psychologist tracking a methodical serial killer.Instead of playing the role in drag the erstwhile Madea simply is a drag Perrys attempt at reinterpreting novelist James Pattersons eponymous meal-ticket protagonist - already skillfully played by Morgan Freeman in previous film adaptations Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider - reveals the pitfalls of casting familiar performers in generic material. Stripped down to his undershirt or brandishing an assault rifle Perry looks both incongruous and ridiculous - an icon out of water. Screen grab from the online trailer for ""Alex Cross"" Movies Alex Cross The official trailer But he doesnt take the medal for bad acting in Alex Cross not by a long shot. That prize goes to Matthew Fox whose ruthless assassin is one of the most implausible movie antagonists in some time a calculating sociopathic genius who does MMA fighting in his spare time.""I suppose that I am having fun"" he cackles to Cross during one of their cellphone tete-a-tetes (a la In the Line of Fire which director Rob Cohen is shameless about ripping off) and while its hard to tell whether its the character or the actor talking the fact is that both are hilarious in spite of themselves. But with its gorier-than-necessary violence and clumsily articulated themes of loss and retribution its clear that a comedy wasnt intended here.Foxs reign of terror begins with the seduction torture and killing of a hottie (Stephanie Jacobsen) with vague ties to the shadowy money men who have turned Foxs tattooed maniac loose on Detroit for mysterious reasons. Her status as a mere plot point is passed on to other female characters who exist only as victims-in-waiting - characters whose deaths will need some serious avenging. (The one exception is Crosss mother played by the great Cicely Tyson in a committed but completely thankless performance.)The sequence where Cross and his partner Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) survey the crime scene and exchange terse bits of investigatory argot goes from dully cliched to stunningly glib when they bicker wearily over who has to use a severed thumb to open a hidden safe a nasty detail that even CSI would skip over.From there the plot beats are as predictable as rush-hour traffic. Cross almost nabs the bad guy during a high-rise shootout and commits the sin of hubris by telling his superiors that he has his quarry right where he wants him. A couple of scenes later he is glowering his way through a family funeral and sawing off a shotgun. The trope of the lawman who is forced to reorient his moral compass is older than Dirty Harry but there is still something distasteful in how willingly Cross and Kane go rogue (assaulting a material witness with a golf club becomes a justifiable MO).Any reservations about the films ideology are ultimately subordinate to its simpler and more conspicuous failures however. A late scene involving a rocket launcher is nicely executed but a drawn-out final confrontation in a dilapidated building stretches any remaining credibility to the breaking point. The image of Perry desperately hanging by a thread as if threatening to take the whole structure with him provides an unfortunately apt emblem for this dismal attempt.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Tyler Perry replaces Morgan Freeman as the forensic psychologist last seen in ""Along Came a Spider"" this time tracking a shadowy assassin. BOTTOM LINE A failure on every level from Perrys awkward spluttering performance to the incoherent script. Even the stuntmen look like stuffed dummies. CAST Tyler Perry Matthew Fox Ed Burns LENGTH 142 After examining the fingerless body of a dead prostitute keen-eyed detective Alex Cross (Tyler Perry) starts thinking. Within seconds he spits out this profile ""He wants to make somebody hurt. I dont know who. Maybe his mother."" No kidding Sherlock. The guy who sold Cross his morning doughnut could have whipped up a smarter hypothesis but then just about any schmo on the street could have made a better movie than ""Alex Cross"" an uncommonly awful action-thriller that fails on absolutely every level. It feels almost cruel to laugh at such a blindly stumbling dunderheaded action-thriller but you wont be able to help it.

This time Cross is tracking a killer nicknamed Picasso (Matthew Fox all buggy eyes and manic giggles) who left behind a drawing once but otherwise has no clear motivation or back story. Hes one of several stock characters including Cross loyal partner Thomas (Edward Burns); some ill-used women (Rachel Nichols Carmen Ejogo) and an oily foreign businessman (Jean Reno). Cicely Tyson whos been in several Perry films plays Cross no-nonsense mother. Perry best known for his rowdy ""Madea"" comedies replaces Freemans poise and intelligence with cop-show fight moves and spluttering bluster (""I will hunt you down like a rabid dog"") which is in keeping with this clumsy movies M.O. Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"") directs so sloppily that the stuntmen look like stuffed dummies and the script (by Mark Moss and Kerry Williamson) is a stew of undercooked ideas some lifted from past Cross movies. ""It aint over"" Cross says ominously after the films anticlimax.

Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Cicely Tyson relents on Alex Cross In ""Alex Cross"" Cicely Tyson plays Cross (Tyler Perry) grandmother Nana Mama a former teacher and principal who raised him and acts as the conscience of the detective-turned-FBI profiler. ""Alex Cross"" is an unlikely movie for Tyson. In fact after reading the script she says she told director Rob Cohen that the film was not her ""cup of soup. This is too violent."" But Cohen saw only the elegant Tyson in the role. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""I wanted her because ever since saw her in Sounder and Miss Jane Pittman she seemed to me to be the epitome of powerful womanhood"" he says. ""I wanted a woman who could stand toe to toe with Alex Cross. She is the only thing preventing him from stepping onto the slippery slope of revenge to get this guy. It just seemed like Cicely had it all -- she had the gravitas the wicked sense of humor and the presence to pull that off."" His persistence -- and her strong bond with Perry -- wore her down. Even so theres a good chance Tyson wont be seeing ""Alex Cross"" on the screen. ""I dont usually watch myself"" she says.

Tyler Perry takes off his directors cap and his housedress to play the alpha-male lead in this cop thriller which also reveals that Matthew Fox has totally missed his calling. Who knew the sensitive guy from ""Lost"" was so in touch with his inner psycho? (Perhaps the female bus driver he allegedly crotch-punched in real life last year knows.) Aside from these curious role reversals though ""Alex Cross"" is a mess. Drawing on every conceivable 80s B-movie action cliche and treating its beleaguered female characters like pieces of meat (literally in one scene of butchery) director Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"") squanders a surprisingly recognizable cast on a half-baked plot adapted from James Pattersons series of novels. Alex Cross (Perry) we quickly learn is a superhuman police detective who always gets his man fights for the underdog loves his family and ""can tell you had scrambled eggs for breakfast at 100 yards"" raves his partner Tommy (Ed Burns). This latter-day Sherlock Holmes also uses his freakish powers of deduction to inform his wife (Carmen Ejogo) that ""you had a latte"" as he points to a cartoonish dollop of foam resting on her lapel. No wonder the Detroit P.D. is paying him the big bucks. Alex and Tommy are tracking a killer (Fox) they call Picasso after his practice of leaving surrealist charcoal drawings at the scene of his latest brutality. The bare-headed tattooed Fox seems to have simultaneously slimmed down and bulked up for the role and stayed awake for about two weeks straight. This patented Christian Bale shtick works pretty well for him. Its too bad he spends most of the film having petulant cellphone conversations with Perry wholl eventually go rogue after the killer targets his loved ones and start threatening to ""meet [him] at the gates of hell."" Perrys not a terrible actor but he lacks the brimstone-summoning gravitas of Morgan Freeman who played Cross in previous Patterson adaptations ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider."" Hes really at his best when bantering with his co-workers Burns Rachel Nichols -- totally confoundingly forgotten in the movies third act -- and police chief John C. McGinley (""Scrubs"") whose presence constantly made me feel the film was about to acknowledge its own silliness. (It doesnt.) Also look for enjoyably typecast appearances by Cicely Tyson as Cross no-BS mother Jean Reno as a rich French dude Giancarlo Esposito as a drug lord and German actor Werner Daehn (youll recognize him as Evil Foreign Guy from other movies) who gets to utter my favorite of many howlers ""Nonsense"" he sputters when told hes in danger. ""Zees building ees impenetrable"" As is the logic of the MPAA This violent torture-happy film is rated a mere PG-13. If youre squeamish consider yourself warned.

Starring Tyler Perry Matthew Fox Rachel Nichols Edward Burns Jean Reno Giancarlo Esposito Director Rob Cohen Running time 141 Release Opened Oct 19 2012  Editorial Review Tyler Perrys action heroBy Michael OSullivanFriday October 19 2012The first thing youll want to know about ""Alex Cross"" is Can Tyler Perry carry it off? The answer is Sort of but not really. As novelist James Pattersons beloved Washington-based detective and Sherlock Holmesian forensic psychologist Perry has a tall order to fill. Not only must he banish all thoughts of Morgan Freeman who portrayed the character in ""Kiss the Girls"" (1997) and ""Along Came a Spider"" (2001) but he also must shake his association with Madea the over-the-top drag role for which Perry is best known. To assist with the first part director Rob Cohen -- along with writers Marc Moss who penned ""Spider"" and Kerry Williamson -- re-situate the action in Detroit not D.C. turning it into a prequel of sorts to the two earlier films. Its like a superhero origin story. That analogy is oddly apt. Over the course of ""Alex Cross"" which follows the detectives pursuit of a psychopathic assassin (Matthew Fox) who has killed Crosss wife (Carmen Ejogo) our hero turns into a morally dubious avenging angel. Forget about Morgan Freeman; Perrys more like the Punisher from Marvel Comics bending and in some cases breaking the rules to exact his single-minded revenge. As for Madea Perry does his darnedest to maintain a poker face and he largely succeeds. Hes a fungible action hero interchangeable with almost any other when it comes to running jumping punching and shooting. When it comes to the hard work of acting however hes lacking most notably in scenes surrounding and following his wifes murder. Fake grief just doesnt suit him. Perry is moderately better at conveying smoldering rage which he shares with his cop partner (Edward Burns) whose girlfriend and fellow officer (Rachel Nichols) also has been murdered in grisly fashion. Although rated PG-13 ""Alex Cross"" is surprisingly violent and includes images of torture. This of course is because ""Alex Cross"" is less of a Tyler Perry movie than a Rob Cohen movie. The director of ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""XXX"" leaves his bloody prints all over the place indelibly. Freeman would likely not have fared much better than Perry does here considering the unsubtle material that the movies cast has to work with. Fortunately some of the films tone of strained seriousness is cut by moments of genuine humor even if some of it is unintentional. Early in the film when Cross tells his wife hes considering moving to Washington to take a new job as an FB.I. profiler -- sequel alert -- she replies ""I have no idea what the public schools are like in D.C."" That line got an appreciative chuckle from a preview crowd and will probably continue to do so at least locally. In the role of Crosss opposite Fox makes the strongest impression. Known as ""the Butcher of Sligo"" his villain may be generic -- hes a nut who considerately leaves clues at the crime scene -- but the actor is so physically transformed that fans of ""Lost"" may hardly recognize him with his shaved head and sinewy physique. The cat-and-mouse game his character plays with Cross is enjoyable enough even if the twist tacked on at the end disappoints. But ""Alex Cross"" isnt meant to be analyzed too deeply. The title character probably sums up the best strategy for appreciating the films modest pleasures when he says ""Dont overthink it; Im just looking for a bad guy.""Contains brief crude language gunplay torture violence drug references and sex.

(AP Photo/Summit Entertainment) Photo Sidney Baldwin Associated Press Alex Cross review Director stands alone 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Alex Cross Action. Starring Tyler Perry Matthew Fox and Rachel Nichols. Directed by Rob Cohen. (PG-13. 101 minutes.) There is one thing interesting about ""Alex Cross"" and if you miss this youve missed the whole movie. Its not the story - its worse than mediocre. Its not the lead actor - nothing wrong with Tyler Perry but as an action star hes no Vin Diesel. And its not the dialogue which has a clunker every other scene. Its the direction. Notice the direction. ""Alex Cross"" is a good example of what a seriously talented director can do with a heaping pile of garbage. Director Rob Cohen specializes in action and is best known for founding the ""XXX"" and ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchises. His work is big aggressive and clear and he never forgets that if you dont care about whos doing the action you dont care about the action. Theres an early scene in which a homicidal lunatic (Matthew Fox) tries his lethal hands at cage fighting. It calls for Cohen to create a world thats underground and pulsing with energy and forbidden lusts as if the lid has been pulled off to reveal a churning subculture. It reminded me of the nighttime racing scenes in ""The Fast and Furious"" and the private club scene in ""XXX."" But Cohen doesnt get another chance in ""Alex Cross"" to paint that kind of grand baroque atmosphere. By action-movie standards the story is small scale One lone demented sadist - a ""stimulus seeking sociopathic narcissistic"" working as a paid assassin - is killing powerful people in international finance. And its up to Alex (Perry) and his partner Tommy (Edward Burns) to find and put this guy away. Cohen lavishes time on the personal lives of the two detectives because he wants us to know and care about them. Alex has a lovely wife (a radiant and memorable Carmen Ejogo) two kids and a child on the way. And Tommy has a girlfriend also a cop that hes serious about. As in wedding bells serious. These men and their healthy rewarding relationships are effectively contrasted with the personal life of the assassin well-played by Fox as an insulated self-protective hypersensitive study in perversion. Thus the groundwork is laid. What follows is a succession of atrocities and outrages while the cops play catch-up and become increasingly frustrated. Alas the story itself has two big problems. The first is that the audience can barely care about the assassins course because we dont care about the people hes murdering. The second is that when the movie does come up with a way to turn Alex and Tommys quest into something personal it doesnt do so in a way that energizes the story. Theres no urgency. On the contrary the story to its detriment goes to places that are downright disheartening. So the director is out there on his own. Cohen compensates by taking every bit of action and pumping it up. He doesnt bloat the big moments but he does get your attention. Even when you know an explosion is coming for example the explosion is a little more interesting than you expected. And theres a sequence on a commuter train thats meticulously constructed. In this way a movie that could have been unwatchable almost becomes something to see. At the very least audiences who stumble into ""Alex Cross"" will find ways to enjoy it. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

The film stars John Hawkes and Helen Hunt and won the audience prize at the Sundance Film Festival. By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 18 2012 825 p.m. ET When John Hawkes came on screen as the heroines uncle Teardrop in ""Winters Bone""--a role that won him an Oscar nomination--it was easy to mistake him for an Appalachian local whod been hired on the spot to play a menacing version of himself. Theres no risk of such confusion in Ben Lewins ""The Sessions."" Hes clearly a superb actor playing a singular character--a polio victim paralyzed from the neck down and partly dependent on an iron lung who undertakes at the age of 38 to lose his virginity. Its an extraordinary performance from the pinched voice conveying anxiety with humor to the twisted posture that can express almost simultaneously the agony of severe disability and the ecstasy of human contact. Still its a performance from start to finish. If theres a way of transcending its artifice and suspending disbelief I couldnt find it. ENLARGE John Hawkes and Helen Hunt Fox Searchlight Pictures Mr. Lewin himself a polio survivor based his screenplay on the true story of a California writer and poet the late Mark OBrien and most specifically on a 1990 article Mr. OBrien wrote called ""On Seeing a Sex Surrogate."" The surrogate Cheryl played by Helen Hunt is a thoroughgoing professional at the start of whats meant to be a physically intimate yet emotionally neutral therapeutic process. She briskly notes the difference between herself and a prostitute (a prostitute wants return business) while informing Mark that his course of therapy will be limited to six sessions; thus the movies title. Inevitably Cheryls emotional defenses crumble and the relationship becomes personal in the extreme. (And sometimes funny as well a sex farce played in new territory.) At the heart of it is Marks slow sometimes tortured progress from a position of terror--a man who has lived mainly inside his mind he has never seen a naked woman in the flesh--through the intense pleasure of being touched to the exquisite joy of sexual release. The specifics of the process are depicted forthrightly and Mr. Hawkes does wonderfully well at portraying Mark as a full-blooded guy stuck in a ravaged body rather than a poster man for disability. That alone gives the film an unassailable reason for being. ENLARGE William H. Macy Fox Searchlight Pictures Still much of the story feels predictable; its a strange combination of specificity without spontaneity. Cheryls role is written clumsily; the sex surrogate comes equipped with a jealous husband (a ponderous performance by Adam Arkin) and Ms. Hunt plays her with an odd quality of calculated warmth. William H. Macy is Father Brendan a priest whos asked to bless Marks therapeutic union. While Father Brendan is understandably uncomfortable in his role--fornication is fornication or so he thinks at the outset--Mr. Macy seems uncomfortable too; he leans into his laugh lines like a slugger on an off day. The suspension of disbelief is always a mysterious matter and all the more so in films with disabled characters played by able-bodied actors. When were able to make the imaginative leap its because the film provides an exceptional something to launch us the wild energy of Daniel Day-Lewis in ""My Left Foot""; the ferocious combat of Patty Duke and Anne Bancroft in ""The Miracle Worker""; the odd-couple camaraderie of ""The Intouchables""; the visual poetry of ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly."" By contrast ""The Sessions"" is admirable and often enjoyable yet self-limiting in concept. Its exactly about what it sets out to be about--no less but no more. The Flat ""Dont ask dont tell"" takes on new meaning in Arnon Goldfingers haunting documentary about family secrets that remained secret for almost a century because the adults didnt want to disclose them and the children didnt know there were questions to pose. The film begins in contemporary Tel Aviv soon after the death of the filmmakers 98-year-old grandmother Gerda; shed been born in Germany and emigrated to Palestine with her husband Kurt before World War II. The early scenes are haunting enough for anyone who has witnessed a loved ones possessions reduced to garbage bags stuffed with clothes and boxes full of bric-a-brac that may or may not be worth selling. (An estate buyer is particularly dismissive of the dead womans huge library. No one he says reads Shakespeare or Balzac any more "" Goethe forget it."") Among Gerdas papers however is an eye-catcher and heart-stopper ""A Nazi Travels to Palestine"" a series of articles published in a notorious fascist tabloid of the 1930s. ""What"" Mr. Goldfinger asks ""is Nazi propaganda doing in my grandmothers flat?"" Watch a clip from the German documentary ""The Flat."" As a documentarian cleans out the flat that belonged to his grandparents (both immigrants from Nazi Germany) he uncovers clues pointing to a complicated and shocking story. (Photo IFC Films) The answer to that is the substance of the film which goes from intriguing to astonishing by way of unfathomable. I wont spoil your experience of an unfolding mystery thats all the more surprising for being factual though the greatest surprises lie in the complexities of human behavior. Instead Ill talk around it by saying that the Nazi in question after traveling to Palestine played a significant role in organizing the Holocaust; that Gerda and Kurt both of them German Jews considered him a cherished friend and that the friendship evidently cherished on both sides was rekindled and sustained after the war. Thats not the only mystery. The filmmakers curiosity--plus what must have been his excitement at the prospect of a powerful film--leads him deeper into his familys history where he discovers a turn of events too bizarre to be explained too dismaying to be dismissed. And when he shares his trove of discoveries with the Nazi travelers daughter a woman of culture and charm who has lived in postwar England he finds common bonds between her family and his own--a gift of denial a penchant for keeping skeletons securely locked in their closets. What makes ""The Flat"" mesmerizing is its wealth of historical detail. What makes it universal is what it says about families everywhere--that children being children dont want to know what their parents are up to and that grown-ups being human dont want to credit troubling facts that conflict with what they need to believe. --J.M. ENLARGE Tyler Perry Summit Entertainment Alex Cross The opening scene of ""Alex Cross"" serves notice of whats to come by taking us down into a Detroit sewer. This would-be thriller is not dare I say it a remake of ""The Third Man"" but a retread of the title character a psychologist who was created by the novelist James Patterson and played on screen until now by Morgan Freeman. This time around hes played by Tyler Perry manned up from his crowd-pleasing fortune-amassing roles as the formidably female Madea. Mr. Perrys fans may welcome his transformation into an action hero cum vigilante and he does get away with it; hes a virile presence with a seductive voice and an instinct for throttling back when those around him are losing their minds. But for those who remember Mr. Freeman in the role--and who remember what a decent movie looks like--""Alex Cross"" is the pits if not quite the sewer. Watch a clip from the film ""Alex Cross."" A homicide detective (Tyler Perry) is pushed to the brink of his moral limit as he tangles with a ferociously skilled serial killer (Matthew Fox). (Photo amp; Video Summit Entertainment) It neglects for one thing to make any sense. Granted that Alex has been upgraded from an astute shrink to a know-it-all Sherlock Holmes but the man knows things that cant be known like the climactic whereabouts of a psycho killer played twitchily but far from bewitchingly by Matthew Fox. (In fairness the writing of the killers role is idiotic.) Rob Cohen has directed tumultuously a cast that includes Rachel Nichols Edward Burns Jean Reno Carmen Ejogo and in a small but striking role Giancarlo Esposito. The most notable part of ""Alex Cross"" may be a product placement that puts a sleek new Cadillac in the hands of the bad guy. The finest flower of the new Detroit doesnt need to be loved just admired for its cool. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE Breathing Lessons The Life and Work of Mark OBrien (1996) Jessica Yu won an Oscar for her 35-minute-long documentary which can be streamed via Amazons Instant Video service. ""Polio is a virus"" Mr. OBrien explains his head barely free of the iron lung that encases his body. ""Most people who get it it doesnt affect them very bad. But some people like me get it bad. I got it so bad I cant use my limbs. And I have a hard time breathing outside this machine."" This is far from a feel-good film but it helps you understand what its hero felt in the course of his involuntary heroism.

"Movie review Alex Cross Tyler Perry armed with silly lines - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Alex Cross and Tyler Perry are armed with silly linesIn playing a gritty homicide detective the comic actor shows he can be much more than Madea. He just needs the proper vehicle and this isnt it.October 18 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Tyler Perry stars in ""Alex Cross."" (Sidney Baldwin Summit...)""Alex Cross"" the new action thriller starring Tyler Perry not in drag makes one thing perfectly clear a no one had better cross Cross. Sure he may be a respected homicide detective and a psychologist to boot which can make for one cool customer. But he also has a really bad temper really big guns and really bad dialogue. He will use all of them excessively if pushed.And pushed he is in this out-of-control roller coaster ride through the very tiny world of Detroits 1% a group that has become the target of a serial sniper just as it was about to turn Motor City into a modern high-rise mecca. I swear that city just cant catch a break. Cadillac however can a its many models get all of ""Alex Cross"" beauty shots. OnStars tracking system gets a plot plug too.The killer is one sick twist named Picasso (Matthew Fox) whose signature is leaving charcoal sketches of the victims at the scene of the crime. Between the cage fighting the tattoos the shaved head and the sadomasochistic tics the actor has never ever been more lost a six TV seasons on that remote island notwithstanding.FOR THE RECORD ""Alex Cross"" A review of the movie ""Alex Cross"" in the Oct. 19 Calendar section said Cicely Tyson plays the mother of the Alex Cross character. Tyson plays his grandmother. aThis of course is not the first film cut at novelist James Pattersons popular character but a redo of the once hoped for franchise that starred Morgan Freeman. It produced a couple of duds 1997s ""Kiss the Girls"" and 2001s ""Along Came a Spider.""The new iteration is directed by Rob Cohen who seems to have misplaced his ""The Fast and the Furious"" action mojo and written by Marc Moss and Kerry Williamson who seem to have misplaced their Screenplay 101 manual. The casting is no doubt driven in part by the hope that the money guys can get some of that Tyler Perry box-office magic. Perry may actually pay off; not much else about the movie does.As the film opens everything in Alex Cross life is about to change. Hes got the offer of an FBI desk job in D.C. The family which includes wife Maria (Carmen Ejogo) and two kids might be expanding. His mother played with an iron fist by Cicely Tyson is affectionately called Nana Mama a name no one pronounces believably. Cross partner Det. Thomas Kane (Edward Burns) has been his best friend since elementary school.Then Picasso comes to town and starts eliminating the super rich and leaving those sketches. When Cross starts putting together the pieces and asking too many questions Picasso goes postal a and Cross returns in kind.The killings themselves are exceedingly gruesome. But no sense of dread about who will die next or how awful it will be ever materializes. Either the script or the camera angles give away the next victim every time.There are bursts of decently executed action a one long and bruising battle in an old Detroit building is kind of cool a but not nearly enough to keep the adrenaline pumping. The emotional pacing is even more problematic.Youd think with the city elite being picked off in such dastardly fashion everyone would be working 24/7. They arent. Cross and his wife have their regular date night. Thomas is busy courting one of the other detectives. Even Capt. Brookwell (John C. McGinley) doesnt start yelling at the troops until the very end.Some of the dialogue is so bad its like an ""SNL"" skit gone south. Then just as you begin to think that maybe ""Alex Cross"" is supposed to be a comedy something serious like a funeral will happen. Or somebodys body parts will be strewn around.As Cross Perry swings between sweet emotional moments with his daughter borderline boredom with most of the cop work and bouts of rage. The best of the ""Alex Cross"" mess suggests that as an actor he has the talent to move beyond the world of Madea should he want to. He just needs to look for much better material.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCicely Tyson Milestones and facts about the Tony Award...June 10 2013Alex Cross Can Tyler Perry ever break out of the Madea...October 22 2012Tyler Perry no foe for Paranormal Activity 4 at box officeOctober 18 2012Alex Cross a gamble for Tyler Perry and its creatorsOctober 18 2012Classic Hollywood Cicely Tyson will never settleOctober 14 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-alex-cross-review-20121019,0,4673599.story",200,alexcross14,alexcross,latimes

He is in short Tyler Perrys alter ego. Created by thriller writer James Patterson Cross has been played by Morgan Freeman in two previous movies Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider. But as this title suggests Alex Cross starts from zero. Perrys version of the character is near the beginning of his career yet to experience life-defining events. He also lives in Detroit not D.C. although a new career at the FBIs national headquarters beckons as the story begins. A psychologist as well as a detective Cross is introduced with two scenes. In the first he tries to convince an innocent young woman wearing a prison jumpsuit that she shouldnt take the rap for someone else. In the second he demonstrates his powers of observation -- and his warm home life -- by using meager clues to deduce what his wife (Carmen Ejogo) has been doing. Both episodes will matter later but the movies main event is Cross pursuit of an unnamed assassin (Matthew Fox) instantly diagnosed by the detective as ""a stimulus-seeking sociopathic narcissist."" The killer who enters an illicit boxing match as ""The Butcher of Sligo"" begins by sadistically torturing and killing a Taiwanese sexpot. Exactly why is not clear and wont be even after the anticlimactic wrap-up in which the plots prime conspirator chattily explains it all. But the high female death toll in this movie suggests that the fairly shallow Seven Psychopaths was actually on to something when it lampooned Hollywood action flicks for introducing female characters just to slaughter them. The Butcher who has spy tech worthy of 007 seems to be after Giles Mercier (Jean Reno) a French plutocrat with an inexplicable interest in rebuilding Detroit. Cross and his partner Tommy (Edward Burns) first tangle with the killer in Merciers high-tech tower driving him off. i Cross Monica Ashe (Rachel Nichols) and Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) race against the clock to find the sociopathic assassin. Sidney Baldwin/Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Sidney Baldwin/Summit Entertainment Cross Monica Ashe (Rachel Nichols) and Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) race against the clock to find the sociopathic assassin. Sidney Baldwin/Summit Entertainment Out of pique -- and because hes a stimulus-seeking sociopathic narcissist -- The Butcher retaliates against Alexs and Tommys loved ones. Now its personal and the two cops throw away the rule book to pursue their quarry through Detroits grandly decaying cityscape. The final battle is staged in the rotting Michigan Theater a former movie palace now used as a parking garage. Its a strange sort of film that casts Gallic tough guy Jean Reno as a clean-fingernailed mogul while employing cross-dressing comic Tyler Perry as a guy capable of hand-to-hand combat with someone called The Butcher of Sligo. To play the lean assassin Fox evidently trained (and dieted) for months. Perry doesnt appear to have made comparable effort. The two mens combat would look hopelessly mismatched except that director Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious) shot and edited it so incoherently; the murky scenes camera movements are more violent than the blows. Pattersons novels are known for sadistic violence but Alex Cross managed to get a PG-13 rating by keeping the most disturbing moments off-camera. Rather than watching the assassin sever a victims fingers the audience only gets to see a bowl full of the digits and hear Alex and Tommy banter over which of them will fish out a bloody thumb. Its a moment that like much of this movie is as goofy as it is gruesome.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies ""Alex Cross"" Defective detective REVIEW Even Sherlock Holmes would have trouble finding an original idea in Tyler Perrys violent police flick.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint COLIN COVERT colincovert Its a Hollywood truism that nobody sets out to make a bad movie but how else to explain a debacle like ""Alex Cross""? This overwrought oppressively violent police thriller has not got an original bone in its empty little head. From its cliche opening -- an irrelevant gun battle and chase -- to its derivative climax this is a film with decades of dust on it. In the title role Tyler Perry trades Madeas gaudy XXXL house dress for a Detroit police psychologists drab trench coat. His character is a Sherlockian detective/doctor who walks through crime scenes tossing out snappy snap judgments on what must have led to this particular scattering of corpses. He ""can tell if you had scrambled eggs for breakfast from 100 yards"" as his partner (Ed Burns) puts it. How is it he didnt recognize this dogs breakfast of a script? The film is an odd mix of family-friendly subplots and electroshock violence. Perry plays Cross as a bulldog crime fighter on the job and a good-hearted puppy dog at home. In domestic scenes of marzipan sentimentality he cuddles his adorable kids wife and grandma. Off-duty he is a regular Dr. Phil discussing his emotions and aspirations at the drop of a hankie. But director Rob Cohen (""Fast and Furious"") is less invested in catering to Perrys legions of female fans than in spiking the story with atrocities. Since Perrys performance swerves between leaden and wooden this is an understandable strategy. The story pits Cross against an elite assassin (""Losts"" Matthew Fox in a sneering obnoxious performance) killing executives of billionaire Jean Renos Detroit-based multinational. The hit mans fee is 3 million and its shocking how little your money buys these days. He leaves behind clue-laden sketches of his victims drives a car whose OnStar security system is a snap to track and chooses not to kill Cross when he has a perfect opportunity. It does not require a clairvoyant to capture a perp this perverse. It scarcely calls for a semifinalist on ""Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader."" If you can guess that the fat lady in the billowing red gown and Brunhilde helmet is an opera singer you have the powers of observation necessary to catch this guy. The ease with which the culprit eludes cops feels less like tension-building than time-killing. Sidney Baldwin Summit Entertainment Tyler Perry stars in ""Alex Cross."" ""Alex Cross"" lacks the elements needed to generate anxiety and suspense or even a sense of local color. Instead the movie goes for disorienting action scenes and cleaver-to-the-head shock effects. Foxs whack-job malevolence is Hannibal Lecter on Red Bull. Hes a master of martial arts a deadly sniper an amateur vivisectionist frogman computer whiz and a museum-quality artist. There is nothing he cant do but be believable. Nor does the plot hold water. It takes place in a universe where the exit strategy for corrupt businessmen is to blow up City Hall not declare Chapter 7 and loot the pension fund on the way out the door. You dont have to be a genius behavioral expert to decode the audiences impatient body language during this slog.

"A different kind of Cross-dressing from Tyler Perry - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Alex Cross is a dud Share Tweet Edward Burns (left) and Tyler Perry star in ""Alex Cross"" directed by Rob Cohen. (Sidney Baldwin/Summit Entertainment) Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 10.22.12 | 1044 AM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Some movies make it to theaters and you dont know why. Nothing works. Or some of it works but that doesnt matter because whats working is so deeply painfully boring. ""Alex Cross"" is that kind of movie. If I hadnt had to stay awake I would have slept though the whole thing. At home. This is an attempt to revive a blockbuster publishing franchise -- James Pattersons Alex Cross crime novels -- with Tyler Perry replacing Morgan Freeman. Perry who already has a kind of franchise with his Madea movies would be better served to let her do the detective work in these films. I at least smell ""Tyler Perrys Madeas Crime Scene."" Perry is a big broad man. In ""Alex Cross"" when he gets out of bed shirtless to take an emergency call its like watching a tree go for a walk. Thats part of what makes Madea such a hoot. When she launches herself at somebody you marvel at how the persona confers a kind of lightness on all his heft. As Alex Cross when Perry falls on a perp the only response is ""Timber"" For ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" Morgan Freeman brought a lot of his Morgan Freeman-ness to the table. The reason you wanted to see him as a generic forensic psychologist-detective is that he has the perfect persona for that sort of trench-coated know-it-all part. No killer can outsmart him. Hes too cool too wise. He could just narrate evil into prison. When Perrys not in drag theres no persona. Hes smooth and stoic the way Freeman can be but hes missing Freemans wisdom without replacing that with something of his own. Freeman gets a kick out of himself. Perry gets a kick out of Madea. Even in his own movies Perrys a void. This past February he spent all of ""Good Deeds"" which he also wrote and directed channeling Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense."" He seems less clinically dead in ""Alex Cross."" But you worry that Perrys too self-conscious to be a more than serviceable leading man. When Alex diagnoses the assassin nut job (Matthew Fox) as a ""stimulus-seeking sociopathic narcissist"" it sounds like Perrys interviewing for a job he already has. The movies finale suggests this is only the beginning. So did the applause that broke out the night I saw this movie. Those people must have felt like they were in bed watching a Steven Seagal movie on Showtime 14. Except with Cicely Tyson as Nana Mama a woman who gets to make dinner be grandmotherly and say to Alex ""Boy get your feet off my bench"" Alex spends most of the movie talking to his childhood friend and fellow detective John Sampson (Edward Burns). They both get some bad romantic news on the same day and devote the rest of the movie to trying to bring down Foxs not-so-terrifying killer. ""Alex Cross"" is adapted from the 12th book in Pattersons series the succinctly titled ""Cross."" The movie which Rob Cohen directed is somehow less original. People complained that ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" were cheap ""Silence of the Lambs"" knockoffs (they were). This new movie is like one of those Liam Neeson ""quit taking my stuff"" thrillers but without the slickness defensive macho insanity or Neesons incongruous gravitas. Theres also stuff from almost every movie about a psycho stalking a lawman. But Fox is so jazzed up by his fatless body that he fails to be persuasively out-there. Its like P90X was his acting coach. The entire movie is set in Detroit instead of Pattersons Washington D.C. and its been filmed in anonymous abandoned places that say ""Please film here. Put these crumbling warehouses and factory spaces back to work"" The plot involves a globalist plan hatched by a French businessman (Jean Reno) -- along with a catty German and lusty Chinese woman -- to revitalize the city with such ideas as nanotechnology. The nutjob has them each in his figurative crosshairs. If this were a film with even a gram of adventure or perspective it might seize on any sabotage of Detroit as either a tragic attempt to keep a city choked off from rehabilitation or crazy national pride (""We dont need your stinking internationalist stimulus. We just need to build more cars""). Of course if this movie realized either of those possibilities it would either be ""Shaft 7"" or another Clint Eastwood commercial for Chrysler. But its greedy to want thematic ambition from a movie this badly made. Two minutes of even competent camerawork during the climactic showdown is asking too much.

Director Rob Cohen (141). PG-13 Gruesome violence sexuality drugs. Area theaters. Theres a lot riding on ""Alex Cross"" Rob Cohens scattershot take on the detective series created by novelist James Patterson. Most significantly its Tyler Perrys chance to show that he can carry a franchise he hasnt written produced and directed himself. For better or worse it looks as though there may be a lot more ""Madea"" movies in his future. Perry is a likable presence but the movie around him is such a mess that he never gets to prove his potential. Hes also been completely miscast. Though 6-foot-5 Perry possesses neither the imposing authority nor the wild-card energy required of an action hero. Taking over from Morgan Freeman -- who appeared as Cross in 1997s ""Kiss the Girls"" and 2001s ""Along Came a Spider"" -- Perry plays the detective as a loving gentle family man. His life is nearly destroyed by the appearance of a sadistic sociopath named Picasso (Matthew Fox). Cross and his longtime partner Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) interrupt Picassos attempt to assassinate a billionaire which turns the killers attentions toward them and their loved ones. When Picasso strikes too close Cross and Kane are forced to go way outside jurisdiction to stop him. Though they lack chemistry as a team its gratifying to see both Perry and Burns stretching in ways they havent before. But without any support they repeatedly fall short. The illogical screenplay feels like a dashed-off first draft while the murky visuals and slipshod direction are more confusing than suspenseful. Cohen (""xXx"") seems focused entirely on pacing and does successfully push us from one high-tension scene to another. Once we arrive however theres little worth seeing. The solid supporting cast (including Carmen Ejogo Jean Reno and Cicely Tyson) is mostly wasted theres no reasonable setup for the premise and the ridiculous finale seems cribbed from an episode of ""Scooby Doo."" As for Fox hes stuck playing an underwritten villain with no particular motivation for torturing victims in such gruesome fashion. So he goes way overboard filling in the gaps with a twitchy eye-bulging performance worthy of a Razzie Award. Still this misstep is destined to be a quickly forgotten blip in his career. The movies biggest mystery is whether Perry will be able to say the same. Magic Moment Cross solves a crime with the barest of clues.

"Alex Cross | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; alex-cross ) Alex Cross (United States 2012) October 18 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Alex Cross loosely adapted from the novel Cross by James Patterson has all the earmarks of something contorted and condensed to fit into the 100-minute time limit imposed on mass marketed motion pictures. Parts of the movie feel inexcusably rushed (thereby enhancing their inherent implausibility) - none more so than the incompetently directed climactic fight scene in which director Rob Cohen goes into hand-held mode and shakes the camera as vigorously as possible. The last time we saw Dr. Alex Cross he was played by Morgan Freeman. That was nearly a dozen years ago in the forgettable Along Came a Spider (which was a sequel to 1997s Kiss the Girls). However using the septuagenarian Freeman as the lead in an action-tinged thriller didnt make much sense so the role was re-cast. Not a problem; the Bond movies do this all the time. The choice for the new Cross is Tyler Perry who is moving outside of his comfort zone. The producers obviously hope hell bring his fan base with him. This is a dark movie; theres little opportunity for comedy. Perry shows decent dramatic chops but his competency as an action hero is less certain. Alex Cross is technically an adaptation of Pattersons Cross although so much has been changed that the similarities are few and far between. If one wants to play continuity Nazi with the three Cross movies this would be viewed as prequel/origin story/reboot. It tells the tale of how circumstances conspire to have Cross relocate to Washington D.C. and join the FBI. Cohens pacing is uneven but the tone is consistently grim. Theres also a lot of graphic violence; how this managed to acquire a PG-13 (especially when one considers that Argo went out with an R) is a question to be pondered. Id let an 11-year old see Argo before Alex Cross. I cant recall a PG-13 film this explicit. The film begins with about 20-minutes of setup that introduces all the characters. Dr. Alex Cross (Perry) a police detective and psychologist is the leader of a small team of investigators consisting of himself his best friend Tommy (Edward Burns) and Monica (Rachel Nichols). Tommy and Monica are having an affair. Although they attempt to hide it from Cross nothing gets past this modern-day Sherlock Holmes. Meanwhile Cross home life is getting complicated. His wife Maria (Carmen Ejogo) is pregnant and hes considering switching jobs to get something with more regular hours and better pay. Enter Michael ""The Butcher"" Sullivan (Matthew Fox). Sullivan is a sociopath with a love of causing pain. He works as a hired assassin and his first target is the lovely Fan Yao (Stephanie Jacobson) the COO of a powerful multinational corporation committed to urban renewal in Detroit. Cross immediately determines that Sullivans next victims are likely to be the companys CFO Erich Nunemacher (Werner Daehn) and the CEO Leon Mercier (Jean Reno). However by foiling one of Sullivans carefully planned killings the detectives place themselves in the hit mans cross-hairs and he is quick to strike. Sullivans introduction is handled in cartoonish fashion with a sequence so implausible that suspending disbelief requires a herculean effort. As villains go however he is suitably ghoulish. He talks a bit too much especially near the climax but hes creepy looking and more decisive than the average movie bad guy. Matthew Fox who underwent a stringent training regimen to get in shape for the part looks nothing like the guy who spent all those years on Lost. Instead he bears a striking resemblance to Tom Noonan. To its credit the screenplay does a few unexpected things. For the most part however its a standard order police procedural and at least in its overall structure it follows a predictable trajectory. The botched ending which consists of a one-on-one fight that is impossible to follow due to awful camerawork and poor lighting significantly detracts from the viewers overall enjoyment. Perhaps it was done this way because neither Perry nor Fox could be convincing in traditionally filmed combat but with the options of CGI and/or body doubles thats not a compelling reason. Cohens resume (which includes The Fast and the Furious and xXx) argues that hes a better action director than this; the laziness is inexcusable. The denouement is easily decoded and suitably cheesy. Alex Cross is undoubtedly an attempt to re-introduce a character with franchise potential. Pattersons books are immensely popular but this is a genre that works better in print where 350 pages affords an opportunity for better developed character relationships and a more cohesive narrative. Theres nothing in Alex Cross that argues another installment is warranted but much will depend on whether Tyler Perrys audience crosses over and continues to follow him in this new very different role.

Cliched improbable and frequently risible this police procedural involves an elite assassin (Matthew Fox) who enjoys torturing his victims and taunting the hero over the phone in a diabolical game of cat and mouse.

A savage killer (Matthew Fox) one or two fatal steps ahead of the noble Detroit police detective Alex Cross (Tyler Perry) good women in jeopardy bad women being tortured urgent chases on foot and by car--classic hallmarks of the criminal thriller. But the movie is ugly in spirit and looks. All Alex Cross spiked was my appreciation for Morgan Freeman the original cinematic Alex Cross. Freeman starred in the Patterson adaptations Along Came a Spider (2001) and Kiss the Girls (1997) where he was paired with red hot and very fierce Ashley Judd. With gravitas and grace he elevated the sadistic shlock around him. Yes there were pretty girls kept in dungeons and children being kidnapped and murdered for fun but what mattered was Freemans character study of a wise and damaged man who could diagnose darkness because he knew it firsthand. Perrys new Alex is heavier physically but seems like a lightweight in comparison. (RELATED Which celebrity on TIMEs list would you want reading your autobiography aloud?) Alex Cross serves as a prequel to the other films although the smart phones and gleaming laptops indicate it is set in todays world. Alex is married to Maria (the stunning Carmen Ejogo from Sparkle) and the couple is happily expecting their third child. (Anyone who has read any of Pattersons Cross novels knows how that is going to work out.) Theyre debating moving his Nana (Cicely Tyson) and the kids to Washington D.C. so Alex can take a job with the FBI. Maria is dubious but Alex promises her they have ""great dental."" Then Foxs character called Picasso but self-identifying as the Butcher of Sligo starts killing people. Hes working his way up a corporate ladder to a big cheese CEO Leon Mercier (Jean Reno) who has a plan to rebuild Detroit (heavy on the schematics sketchy on the details). Where Freeman was warm but enigmatic Perry is warm but empty. When the playwright-turned-movie-director and Madea franchise mogul gazes into the distance and theorizes about the killer there is no sense that any calculations are taking place in his brain. ""Ex-military sociopathic narcissist"" he says looking as if his nose is identifying the scents in an overwhelming cologne. (Clove Narcissist Musk) This is the story where Alex Cross experiences his deepest hurt the wound that forms the future FBI profiler but the performance is so emotionally shallow youd never know it. He wears two expressions either the furrowed brow or the jolly smile. Perry has left the hamminess of his Madea incarnation behind but maybe in suppressing her he has suppressed himself. (READ Where does Freeman land on TIMEs Top 10 Badass Geezers list?) But Perry is by no means entirely to blame for how terrible Alex Cross is. The dialogue is often laughable the cinematography garish and the editing mortifyingly unsubtle (theres a cut from Alex cradling a dead woman to a Madonna and child statue in a church). I never got a sense of any detecting happening; a pronouncement is plucked from the air and then Alex and his partner and best friend from junior high Tommy Kane (Ed Burns) race off to the next location. Much pressure is put upon Alex to serve as a human GPS for Picasso. ""Come on man"" Tommy yells at Alex. ""Get inside his head Where would you be?"" (Burns plays essentially the same role he played in last winters Man on a Ledge the not-so-smart cop who makes his partner seem like an Einstein but at least hes mildly amusing in the films early scenes.) When a fight begins director Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious) dissolves into hallucinatory slow motion the camera moving with the grace of a drunkard falling from a bar stool. I believe Cohen is trying to give us concussions. (READ TIMEs profile of Tyler Perry) Then there is the matter of the tedious villain. Matthew Fox has obviously gone to a lot of trouble to slough off Jack from Losts nice guy aura and transform himself into the unhinged maniacal Picasso. Hes rail thin and obsessively buffed and all his pretty teeth look like theyve been filed down and soaked in coffee and nicotine. When an actor makes this kind of commitment to a role and is so very eager to preen we all hope it is worth it just as when a child emerges with their first self-devised Halloween costume we want to be able to say with confidence ""What a great Ninja"" rather than ""So...is that a Ninja?"" Foxs Picasso might generate a ""What a neat Christian Bale Like The Fighter but without any humanity right?"" or perhaps ""Are you dressed up like Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast?"" This Picasso is a copy and this Alex Cross less a reboot than a limp spin-off. READ About the time Joel Stein felt emasculated by Matthew Fox.

SIDNEY BALDWIN Tyler Perry in a scene from ""Alex Cross."" (AP Photo/Summit Entertainment) You can learn a lot from Tyler Perry and his first role in the guise of an action hero is every bit as profound as his Madea movies. But for skeptics who suspect that ""Alex Cross"" is formulaic serial-killer crapola we will allow the mind-blowing script to answer your questions directly.What is this movie about?""A stimulus-seeking sociopathic narcissist."" We assume you are referring to the artsy sadist played by Matthew Fox who is terrorizing Detroit and not to the multitasking mogul who has generated half a billion dollars playing a hostile granny who teaches us all to get along. Why did Perry agree to star in a movie for which he seems so physically and intellectually unsuited?""Hes trying to make somebody suffer.""How does ""Alex Cross"" regard human relationships?""War is a passionate undertaking of strategy and skill just like sex.""Are there thrills?""Prepare yourself the woman was tortured to death.""The Alex Cross character is a husband father detective and psychologist who was previously portrayed by Morgan Freeman. Will an admirer of those films find himself surprised by any plot twists in this one?""Theres not one scenario you can think of that he hasnt already figured out."" Why is a talented fellow like Ed Burns stuck as the sidekick to an actor whose emotional range makes William Shatner seem like William Shakespeare?""You dont play the game the game plays you.""The Burns and Perry characters are lifelong friends. Do they have a believable buddy-cop chemistry?

Im just looking for a bad guy."" Maybe that line is a passive reminder for audiences to simply accept Tyler Perry in the lead role his first in a film not of his own making and more than a decade after Morgan Freeman put his own stamp on the part with ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider."" Maybe it was the mission statement for a fresh set of filmmakers eager to re-translate James Pattersons best-selling character to the big screen by tooling a traditional R-rated murder mystery to serve as more of an action-packed PG-13 revenge thriller. Maybe its really the ultimate explanation for the seemingly cut-rate assembly of it all heres a cat heres a mouse so shut up and deal. Loosely based on Pattersons 12th novel ""Cross"" this origin story of sorts sees the forensic psychologist in Detroit before his eventual move to Washington D.C. The FBIs looking to lure him out east with a juicy job offer and with his wife (Carmen Ejogo) expecting a third child Dr. Cross is just about ready for a desk job. Of course once a hitman alternately nicknamed ""Picasso"" ""The Butcher of Sligo"" and ""Four Roses"" (Matthew Fox) comes out of the woodwork its up to Cross and partners Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) and Monica Ashe (Rachel Nichols) to prevent the killer from taking out his high-profile targets. Much of the downtime is dedicated to everyone around Cross assuring him -- and us -- just how brilliant he is at analyzing crime scenes and tracking down suspects with Cross actual police prowess carrying all the weight of well-rehearsed conjecture. Worse yet is the banter cobbled together by screenwriters Marc Moss (who previously adapted ""Spider"") and newcomer Kerry Williamson full of stale cultural references (Cross calls Jean Renos particularly well-off mark ""Billion Dollar Baby"") and groan-worthy exchanges (""Do you like nature Dr. Cross?"" ""Human nature."") before culminating in an unending series of laughable climaxes. Cohen (""xXx"" ""The Fast and the Furious"" ""Stealth"") toys with competency in his earlier action scenes with a high-rise siege standing as the highlight but the mayhem becomes more frustratingly abstract as the movie goes on with cameras tighter and shakier during fistfights and digital effects even shoddier during a broad daylight ambush. Even in the interim its difficult to determine that one prominent character has actually been killed while another victim is treated to an overwrought funeral. Oh well at least you can dig on this plainly apparent Cadillac product placement (The car of choice for professional assassins it seems.) Naturally the stakes are eventually raised with Cross getting cross once crossed. Its at this point that Perrys considerable physical stature brings more credibility to the character than any sense of emotional gravitas. Understandable is Perrys willingness to demonstrate some range beyond that of his own melodramas but ultimately Perry is no more out of his depth here than anyone else in the cast. Burns Nichols Reno Cicely Tyson (as Cross mother) and John C. McGinley (Cross boss) all seem to be going through the gruff motions with only Giancarlo Esposito (""Breaking Bad"") lending a welcome sense of personality to his brief appearance as a local heavy. That leaves us with Fox the only actor around committed to a full-blown bug-eyed ham-bone performance. His newly ripped physique is indeed no insubstantial feat but the moment he opens his mouth and begins espousing about the pleasure of pain Picassos fierce persona is done in by half. Hes intended to be the chief source of menace in a film more bland than bad but the longer that ""Alex Cross"" goes on the more and more he seems like its unwitting savior. Then again maybe Im just overthinking it.

Alex Cross Bad Director Rob Cohen. Cast Tyler Perry Matthew Fox Edward Burns Carmen Ejogo Jean Reno Cicely Tyson. Rating PG-13 for violence sexual content language and drug references. Like Alda Perry is an actor who radiates niceness and decency a perception enhanced by the roles hes chosen. As the title character in ""Alex Cross"" Perry is perfectly comfortable bantering with his on-screen wife or comforting a crying child. However once his character is pushed to the limit and starts working outside the law Cross slips out of Perrys grasp. He just cant muster up that rage or sense of danger; then again it doesnt help that he is forced to utter lines like ""I will meet his soul at the gates of hell"" with no sense of irony. Cross is a brilliant police psychologist investigating a case involving a psychotic assassin (Matthew Fox) who gets his kicks torturing those he kills. He is dubbed Picasso because he leaves abstract charcoal sketches at crime scenes. Its that kind of movie. The film is directed by Rob Cohen who usually has a way with kinetic action sequences -- think ""The Fast and the Furious"" ""xXx"" and even ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."" But his heart just doesnt seem in this project with the climactic battle filmed so poorly its difficult to tell whats going on. The other performances are strictly uniform except for Foxs intense bug-eyed turn as the killer. The ""Lost"" actor dropped 40 pounds for the role and appears dangerously thin. Its a shame he worked so hard for so little. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849. Twitter.com/randy_cordova.

"Alex Cross movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Alex Cross Nothing original in this origin story  Alex Cross Tyler Perry stars in ""Alex Cross."" Tyler Perry stars in ""Alex Cross."" Chicago Tribune Not that we needed it and pardon the trace elements of contempt regarding the familiarity of this particular narrative hook but Yet another serial killer movie hits theaters this week.In ""Alex Cross"" Tyler Perry way way out of his signature drag character Madeas wig and sensible shoes refashions himself as the forensic psychologist and homicide detective played previously on screen by Morgan Freeman in adaptations of James Pattersons novels ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls."" Perrys going to surprise some people. This was his chance to prove he could hold a film together in a relatively conventional action-hero leading role and the imposingly scaled actor with the soothing voice and rolling gait does the job.But what is the job exactly? Same ol same ol. Catch the methodical sadistic antagonist before he kills again but not too early in the story. Or else theres no story. The story requires its mutilated corpses (snipped-off fingers here charred skin there some of which pushes the PG-13 rating past a sensible limit) in order to exist. The wrinkle here beyond the casting of Perry is in screenwriters Marc Moss and Kerry Williamson pushing Pattersons source novel ""Cross"" (mostly tossed out) into an origin story as well as a straight-up revenge melodrama. I dont remember Morgan Freeman sidelining the characters stoic deductive reason in favor of sawed-off shotguns and bloodthirsty vigilante justice. ""Alex Cross"" begins with wisecracking banter between our hero and his best friend and fellow cop (Edward Burns a genial asset). Then when the slaughter get personal -- as movie serial killers so often take the time to make it -- its all about the Old Testament payback.The murderer known as Picasso given cliched feral intensity by Matthew Fox of ""Lost"" makes a big deal of the one-liner attributed to Confucius ""When seeking out on a path of revenge dig two graves."" This proverb refers to the self-defeating limitations of vengeance but guess what? The proverb doesnt apply to this movie at all ""Alex Cross"" is so down with revenge its practically giddy and with ""Taken 2"" already murdering the box office this month its definitely a buyers market for this stuff.The psycho leaves Cubist-style charcoal drawings at the scenes of his crimes and appears to have his ultimate sights set on what the films production notes describe as ""a Detroit-based multi-national industrialist"" played by Jean Reno. (Cleveland plays the part of Detroit though the production filmed a couple of weeks in Michigan.) Cross the ""head shrinker"" is encouraged by Burns character to ""get inside the monsters head"" and to ""think like him."" (Daisy-fresh that dialogue.) When the film starts Crosss wife (Carmen Ejogo) has a third child on the way and Cross Rock of Gibraltar of a mother (Cicely Tyson visibly thinking back on more interesting projects while filming this one) dispenses hard-won advice on whats important. What happens to the family in ""Alex Cross"" doesnt require a spoiler alert so much as a here-we-go-again alert.Now and then director Rob Cohen whose career includes ""Dragon The Bruce Lee Story"" (a tasty biopic) and other lesser products manages an effectively staged bit of chaos as when a SWAT teams vehicles screech into place during a City Hall lockdown. (If this is the work of the second-unit team Nice going.) The climax however provides the wrong sort of chaos; the closer Cohen rams the camera to his pummeling actors the more you dont know whats actually transpiring. The sharpest five minutes in ""Alex Cross"" by a considerable margin belong to Giancarlo Esposito slyly charismatic as an underworld kingpin with whom Cross once he has crossed over to Charles Bronsonland must conduct some business.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its hard to imagine any role played by Morgan Freeman that would make a comfortable fit for Tyler Perry whos not exactly the most conventionally authoritative figure on American movie screens. All the same its downright painful to watch Perry struggle to take over James Pattersons forensic-psychologist hero Alex Cross previously inhabited by Freeman in 1997s Kiss The Girls and 2001s Along Came A Spider. Perry takes evident (and typically hammy) pleasure in early scenes depicting Cross as an affable family man but his idea of intense cogitation--the characters meant to be a modern-day Sherlock Holmes capable of deducing entire personal histories from the most meager of clues--involves dropping his voice half an octave while staring glassily into the middle distance. And when a tragic turn of events finds Cross seeking bloody revenge and Perry shifts into full-on badass mode... well the best that can be said is that hes sincere. For all that hes still less embarrassing than Losts Matthew Fox likewise cast against type as the films sadistic villain. First seen cage-fighting in whats apparently meant to be a pickup move this sleekly built assassin begins murdering his way up the ladder of a generic high-powered corporation as Perry and his team (Edward Burns Rachel Nichols) collect the severed digits of his victims and do their best to warn the madmans apparent final target kingpin Jean Reno. When Fox takes a personal interest in the cops on his trail--abetted by a totally credible and realistic newspaper story about a solved case that features beaming headshots of all three detectives--things turn decidedly ugly leading to multiple cat-and-mouse phone conversations in which Perry shouts words like ""maggot"" and Fox twitches every muscle he can locate in what remains of his face after he dropped to what appears to be roughly 1 percent body fat. Nominally based on Pattersons 12th novel in the series simply titled Cross Alex Cross was directed by Rob Cohen (XXX The Fast And The Furious) whos far more adept with car chases and explosions than with the sort of vise-tightening suspense for which the author is known. But grievous shortcuts seem to have been taken in the writing as well. Its hard to take a villain seriously when hes sitting around his crime scenes making charcoal sketches in which he embeds clues regarding his next victim (remember this is a paid assassin not John Doe from Seven) and equally tough to credit the hero as an analytical genius when he seems to just pull sudden leaps of insight out of his ass. (To paraphrase the sage words of Holmes when youve eliminated everything that isnt in the script what is in the script however improbable must be the truth.) If the Alex Cross franchise doesnt successfully reboot Perry may want to take a look at the hilariously gung-ho alien hunter Freeman played in Dreamcatcher. That dude seems more up his alley.

As an actor Perry has what Liam Neesons ""Taken"" character might call ""a specific set of skills"" but those skills dont include convincingly portraying a cop-slash-psychiatrist on the mean streets of Detroit. Based on the characters first adventure ""Cross"" (Morgan Freeman played Alex in two films based on later novels in the series) ""Alex Cross"" is essentially an origin story the tale that transitions him from a Detroit police detective to an FBI profiler complete with a Really Big Tragedy that will haunt the brilliant investigator throughout the rest of his life. We originally see Cross chasing a perp through the sewers and capturing him with the help of his comrades Tommy (Edward Burns) and Monica (Rachel Nichols); the latter two are also incidentally doing a terrible job of hiding their non-regulation romance from their coworker. Its not long before the movie unleashes its supervillain a bald sinewy tattooed hired killer known as Picasso (Matthew Fox). One imagines some agent somewhere assuring Fox that by starving himself for the role this movie was going to be his ""Christian Bale moment."" And while Foxs body-modification is certainly impressive his mugging and overacting detract from the overall effect. Anyway Picasso has been hired to eliminate three higher-ups at a multinational corporation with his ultimate target apparently being Giles Mercier (Jean Reno jambon-ing it up); as Cross and his team attempt to foil Picasso they soon find that they themselves and their loved ones have entered the assassins cross-hairs. Theres plenty to find ridiculous in this latest overblown action epic from director Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"" ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"") from Tommys mullet to Cross discovering a clue by randomly turning one of Picassos charcoal sketches into a Mad magazine Fold-In to the pimp-garbed extra in an underground fight club to Cross dismissal of Picasso as a ""status-seeking sociopathic narcissist."" (Wasnt that a deleted verse from ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious""?) Cohen does manage to craft some nifty set pieces (which all appear to take place in the Motor City even though shooting took place in both Detroit and Cleveland) but Picassos sniper shots are far more compelling than the hand-to-hand combat scenes which feature at least as much shaky-cam and incomprehensible editing as ""Taken 2"" if not more. But the big problem here is Tyler Perry woefully out of his league as an action hero. His cross-dressing performance in the recent ""Madeas Witness Protection"" reeked of exhaustion as though he couldnt wait to bust out of the fat suit and the gray wig and show the world his other skills as a performer. Unfortunately if youve seen ""Tyler Perrys Good Deeds"" or ""Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too"" you know that a non-Madea Perry barely registers on the screen. Most of his work as Alex Cross is suffused with blandness broken up only by the occasional moment of ridiculous overacting. (He has a phone call with Picasso thats guaranteed to become a YouTube favorite.) Toward the end of the film Cross gets angry with his police chief (John C. McGinley) and starts speaking quickly and in a higher pitch and for a moment you remember how outrageously entertaining Perrys Madea can be. You may also find yourself rewriting the entire movie with her as the lead. The rest of the players are a very mixed bag Cicely Tyson and Giancarlo Esposito make an impression during their brief turns as respectively Cross mother and a local crime lord but the only lazier thing a casting agent can do than to pick McGinley for a police chief is to hire Burns to play yet another cop. Theyre both fine actors to be sure but they can (and do) play these parts in their sleep. Say what you will about Tyler Perrys cinematic oeuvre no self-made mogul whos this successful has only one arrow in his quiver. Whatever turns out to be his post-Madea star turn however ""Alex Cross"" most definitely isnt it. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

At least not until he chooses better vehicles for branching out.Edward Burns left and Tyler Perry star in the police procedural thriller Alex Cross(Photo Sidney Baldwin Summit Entertainment )Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Tyler Perry Matthew Fox Rachel Nichols Edward Burns John C. McGinleyRated PG-13; runtime 1 hour 41 minutes; opens Friday nationwideComedy actor/writer/director Tyler Perry should not give up his day job. At least not until he chooses better dramatic vehicles for branching out. Alex Cross ( out of four) is a lackluster police procedural thriller in which Perry plays the titular lead -- a shrewd homicide detective who also is a forensic psychologist. Known for his comedies Perry must have felt it was high time for him to try his hand at playing a darker role. But starring in this badly directed suspense-free film with its unintentionally laughable dialogue does Perry no favors.Already known for his plays Perry burst onto the Hollywood scene in 2005 with his singularly popular brand of sassy slapstick comedy. He has since become a huge phenomenon in the upbeat films he writes directs produces and often stars in. They usually have a positive message relating to family and often star Perry as Madea a bossy elderly lady who never hesitates to speak her mind.No doubt Madea would dismiss this movie as a load of hooey whose plot has been done much better on a bevy of TV cop dramas.Nearly everyone around him seems to be simply going through the motions -- from the director and screenwriters down to most of the ensemble cast. Perry is earnest and likable in the part particular in warm scenes featuring his wife (Carmen Ejogo) and his mother (Cicely Tyson).Director Rob Cohen films some fight sequences so murkily with the camera moving so shakily that it can be hard to tell whos hurting whom. A climactic fight between Perry and his serial killer nemesis (Matthew Fox) is shot in such dark colors that it blurs any sense of momentous action.VIDEO Five Questions for Matthew FoxLIFELINE LIVE Tyler Perry slim sexy in Mens HealthALEXANDER Deranged killer drives a Cadillac in Alex Cross movieWriters Marc Moss and Kerry Williamson seem to have ripped a page from the psycho-killer playbook though they did have more literary source material to draw from. Based on the best-selling books by James Patterson this appears to be Cross origin story about his roots as a cop in Detroit before he goes to work for the FBI in Washington.Brainy and intuitive Cross matches wits with a diabolical serial killer nicknamed Picasso. Cross partners Thomas Kane (Edward Burns) and Monica Ashe (Rachel Nichols) offer assists in the killer hunt but it comes down to a matching of wits between Cross and the killer who likes to make abstract drawings in Picassos Cubist style. Hes a sadist with the heart of an artist. Or an artist with the soul of a sadist. Whatever it all feels ridiculous.The killers artistry is obscured by his penchant for torture administered when the victim is conscious and aware but paralyzed. He also likes to call up Cross and viciously taunt him. Its a cat-and-mouse game. And the nefarious dealings go right up to the top echelon of the citys wealthiest powerbrokers. The cinematic cliches just keep on coming. Crime-related television dramas have all covered this ground -- repeatedly.While the action is slack and uninvolving and the look of the film is grubby its the rote tale of Alex Cross vs. the artistic serial killer that most disappoints. For a far better time Turn on the TV and watch an old episode of Bones.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Alex Cross and Picasso exchange threats and meditations on revenge. 96 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/OIeMI7,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/10/17/alex-cross-review/1635165/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,alexcross30,alexcross,usatoday

TWITTER Tyler Perry plays James Pattersons investigator and forensic psychologist opposite Matthew Fox as a sadistic killer. You almost feel sorry for Tyler Perry stepping out of his own universe for the first time to try to expand his range and finding himself in something as thoroughly dismal as Alex Cross. An unpleasant film from the sadistic behavior of its loathsome villain to the grubbiness of its visual palette this stands as a substandard attempt to bring novelist James Pattersons intuitive cop back to the big screen. All the same it will be interesting to observe if much of Perrys generally loyal audience turns out to see him in a major change of pace as well as if nonfans are curious to check him as a potential action hero. Whatever the opening is legs are doubtful. Among other things Alex Cross features a mano-a-mano climax that is a strong contender for the title of worst major fight scene ever to grace a major motion picture. The lighting is dark its framed so tightly you cant tell whos hitting whom or whats going on and the cameras intense jitters make it a virtual parody of filmmakers trying to make something exciting by shaking the camera. Its incredible one of the six producers didnt notice this and demand a retake. Not directly based on any single one of Pattersons novels about the brilliant investigator and forensic psychologist but credited nonetheless as an adaptation of Cross the script by Mark Moss and Kerry Williamson takes the man back to his pre-Washington and FBI days when he was a cop on the Detroit police force (though some might notice that for financial reasons the film was shot largely in Cleveland). This repositioning suits the fact that Perry is about 20 years younger than Morgan Freeman was when he played the role in Kiss the Girls in 1997 and Along Came a Spider four years later. VIDEO Alex Cross Trailer Pits Tyler Perry Against Matthew Fox This is nasty psycho-killer film plain and simple centered on a wily and well-armed sicko who flat-out announces that ""Inflicting pain is a crucial part of my true calling."" In order to look more cadaverously sinister Matthew Fox (Lost) might have shed more weight for a role than anyone since Christian Bale went skeletal for The Machinist. As is exhibited all too vividly at the outset Picasso -- as he quickly becomes known for good reasons -- loves to torture to feel his victims pain you might say and its up to Cross and his boyhood friend and partner Tommy Kane (Edward Burns) to track the maniac down. Unfortunately theres no preparation for the way Cross lays out how the first mass murder went down almost as soon as he arrives on the crime scene apparently so accurately that his visions of what Picasso wrought are simultaneously presented as fact. He would seem to have an unnatural gift for sussing out a bad guys m.o. but we never learn anything about this ability other than that the FBI has noticed it and is paging him to D.C. The idea of moving doesnt sit too well with Cross wife (Carmen Ejogo) who announces shes pregnant with their third child. But domestic decisions will have to wait until the maniac is brought down. On precious little evidence Cross thinks he has Picassos intentions figured out -- he seems to be targeting the extravagantly rich -- but he and Tommy soon find the victims are too close to home. Picasso torments Cross with taunting phone calls and always seems a step or two ahead of his pursuer for whom the hunt becomes a personal obsession. Director Rob Cohen takes no time to set up scenes properly to build suspense or as in the case of the climax and another action interlude involving a car crash to even make them plausible. The camera shakes big time in another sequence when a major lead is discovered that might lead to the killer and a coda set in Bali is preposterous in the way one of the characters spews out information he has no need to disclose. Towering over the other actors (hes 6-foot-5) Perry lumbers around with a degree of charisma but a lack of emotional range or variety in line delivery. Although watchable and certainly different from the usual run of leading men hes not really all that interesting in this character. Fox is plenty convincing as the cretin without the merest morsel of humanity while the other actors just cash their paychecks notably Jean Reno as a French industrialist with an unexplained penchant for turning the city of Detroit around. Ricardo Della Rosas cinematography makes every hue look muddy with production values in general just barely adequate.

From Bond to Bourne bona fide action stars dont get nearly enough credit for their acting an injustice that has seldom been clearer than when watching Tyler Perry strain his way through ""Alex Cross."" The cross-dressing ""Madea"" star seems out of his depth playing the hard-boiled detective made famous by Morgan Freeman in ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls."" Even reliable action helmer Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"" ""XXX"") seems to be off his game here. Though this potential franchise starter may not reposition Perry solid business looks certain. Loosely based on James Pattersons ""Cross"" the 12th novel featuring the Ph.D-carrying forensic psychologist this clunky thriller clearly intends to recast the bankable Perry in a new light especially on the heels of ""Good Deeds"" and his recent ""Star Trek"" cameo both of which suggested untapped versatility. But it turns out the actors range is more limited than expected. Much of that is Cohens fault The director acquits himself on the action front but makes the simple procedural elements feel wooden and melodramatic particularly in sappy home-life scenes. Perry clearly feels more comfortable with the latter fawning over the news that his wife (Carmen Ejogo) is pregnant or playfully sparring with Cicely Tyson as his overbearing ""Nana Mama"" -- moments that would be right at home in one of his own films. Here they serve to set up a relatively generic backstory needed to justify the characters aggressive transformation later in the film as Perry strains to portray harder-edged ruthlessness. But ""Alex Cross"" demands such heavy mettle considering the dark crime the detective has been sent in to investigate A sadistic assassin (Matthew Fox scarily skinny) takes sick delight in torture-killing prominent white-collar types making his way up the chain to French fat-cat Giles Mercier (Jean Reno looking as though he swallowed not just the canary but the entire pet store). Foxs creepy contract killer whose eclectic hobbies include bare-knuckle boxing and charcoal sketching goes by multiple names ""the Butcher of Sligo"" in the ring and ""Picasso"" to those who discover his drawings at the scene of the crime. It doesnt take a man of Cross intelligence -- ""a guy who can tell you had scrambled eggs for breakfast at 100 yards"" per partner Thomas Kane (Edward Burns) -- to decipher the clues embedded in Picassos latest sketch left beside the body of a woman he rather theatrically relieved of her fingers. Cohen seems to relish such scenes lingering on Picassos obsession with pain Its implied that he suffers from congenital insensitivity to pain a condition ideal for villains as demonstrated in ""The Girl Who Played With Fire."" Considering how bland its eponymous hero is ""Alex Cross"" demands a compelling foil to keep things interesting and Fox proves plenty unsettling in a role more effectively cast against type than the lead. Still between its tired blue-gray grittiness and primetime-TV production values the film offers neither originality nor a clear sense that superior police skill has anything to do with the ensuing cat-and-mouse game. On one hand Picasso seems to be baiting investigators to guess where he will strike next but when they do averting an assassination in a spectacular high-rise shootout he loses his temper and starts targeting cops. Basically the plot functions to deliver Cross from one setpiece to the next driving toward a climactic showdown in what remains of the decaying Michigan Theater. (Incentives shifted the story from D.C. to Detroit until the tax breaks ran out forcing the production to neighboring Cleveland.)
