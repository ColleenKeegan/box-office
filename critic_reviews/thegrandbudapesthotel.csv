Set in the fictional European providence of Zubrowka Andersons latest feature focuses on the inhabitants of a once-grand (not actually in Budapest) hotel and the shocking crime that set the scene for its inevitable decline. Andersons film flows between three timeframes - present day 1968 and 1932 using period-appropriate aspect ratios for each (the boxy nature of the 1.371 ratio used for the earliest parts of the story is at first a distraction to modern minds and then a pleasure) - and is the story of a now-weathered author (present day) recounting a favorite story (that he heard in 1968) from a man who lived it in 1932. That story is centered on the early adventures of the Grand Budapests cherished concierge M. Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) and young lobby boy Zero (the storyteller of 1968) and it occasionally switches back and ties into the action of the films other time periods rounding out a richly imagined mythology. M. Gustave H is a bit of a dandy - immaculately dressed fully attuned to his job generously perfumed and intimately involved with many of the hotels more age-advanced patrons - and he is beloved by both staff and guests. Hes just good at well everything which makes the false accusations of murder that are eventually hurled at him so painful (the false imprisonment that follows proves to be more painful to Gustave himself). Like Gustave young Zero (a charming Tony Revolori) is deeply dedicated to and enamored of his job and he approaches his duties with relish. Zero also (quite quickly and wisely) realizes that following the whims of M. Gustave H is the way to reach the top of the Grand Budapest heap and he soon becomes his most trusted confidant. Zeros loyalty will ultimately prove to be Gustaves saving grace and it effectively serves as the emotional center of the film. Gustave for all his charms has run afoul of a family who are not too pleased with his long-standing romance with matriarch Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) whose mysterious death prompts a reading of the will that doesnt please them. Madame D.s only son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and an evil lackey Jopling (Willem Dafoe nearly vampiric in his nefariousness) set out to frame Gustave for the murder so that the rest of the children can capitalize on their mothers treasures especially a priceless painting that she pointedly bequeathed to Gustave. What follows is a murder mystery that takes Zero and Gustave around Zubrowka and back all to clear his name and discover whats really going on. Despite the films title much of the action of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" happens beyond the resorts walls with plenty of stops at Madame Ds home the prison Gustave is confined to a train or three and the snowy climes of Zubrowka. Its one of the films major missteps however to take the action away from the finely crafted hotel the kind of place that seems ripe for its own explorations and adventures. Although Anderson has built out the world of Zubrowka it is the world of the Grand Budapest that is most intriguing and every scene that takes place at the hotel is exciting and engaging to watch. Anderson doesnt do repeats but heres hoping he decides that he has more tales to tell from his gorgeous hotel in the very near future. Anderson has always been skilled at building his own worlds but the wholesale imagining of both the hotel in particular and Zubrowka at large place ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" in the familiar company of the filmmakers other recent works ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" which similarly crafted their own literal topographies. Anderson has abandoned a bit of his whimsical nature for the later portions of the film but the films first half hour presents one of his most darling settings yet until of course it all crumbles into murder mayhem and bad renovations. Plenty of Andersons usual suspects pepper the films supporting cast from Bill Murray to Jason Schwartzman to Owen Wilson to Edward Norton but most of the action rests on the shoulders of a pair of Anderson newbies - Fiennes and Revolori - who perfectly inhabit the auteurs whimsical world while also building their own very charming relationship within its contexts and constructs. Saoirse Ronan is also good in her somewhat limited role and Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham are a solid pairing. The time-spanning conceit of the film is well executed and although it could have been used to delight audiences with more surprise elements (that the aged storyteller is in fact an older Zero is announced early on) it does add to the emotion of the story and its flow. Fiennes and Revolovi are a deeply amiable pair but the bounds and bonds of loyalty remain a fertile land for Anderson and his films to explore. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is not his grandest work yet but it is one worth an extended stay.

Most of the action takes place in the pre-communist heyday of the titular (and pinkly ornate) Alpine retreat and involves concierge extraordinaire Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his attempt to claim the priceless painting left to him by a grateful old guest/lover. The mannered madcap proceedings are often delightful occasionally silly and here and there gruesome and/or heartbreaking. But the real star of the show is Anderson himself -- the storyteller relating events in his own ineffable fashion -- a point he makes by nesting Gustaves tale in layer after layer of narrative device. We open with a fangirl paying tribute to a dead author then cut to author in his latter days then to author in his younger days picking up the story from an old man full of memories then to the old man as a young witness.

The movie takes place in an imaginary European land twixt WWI and WWII at a magical pink hotel that represents for Anderson a cosmopolitan refuge from the gathering ugliness of approaching war.The place is run by a concierge of comically prodigious skill M. Gustave played by Ralph Fiennes the movies best asset. The actor is crafty enough to give Anderson what he demands (another mannered and stylized performance) while also giving the movie what it needs - an actual human presence and a bit of soul.M. Gustave is both the main character and its subject - a fellow of impeccable taste and refinement and also a scoundrel. Any good concierge after all must give guests what they want. What his dowager clients want is sex and Gustave efficiently provides it.When one of them (Tilda Swinton) croaks Gustave is awarded a valuable painting and takes off before his award can be contested. Ruthless heirs (Adrien Brody Willem Dafoe) pursue invoking the shaggy dog trans-Europe chase structure that forms the remainder of the movie.Gustave rallies all Europes concierges to his cause (a funny idea) but their influence is limited and their tasteful and orderly world shrinking - soon gone for good. The thugs are taking over and thats Andersons meant-to-be-tragic point.Throughout are the old Anderson flourishes - an excess of cameos the tightly controlled performances. It was only a matter of time before the director instructed some Oscar winner not to move or breath at all and it happens to Swinton who plays a corpse.There are new things as well. He squeezes/enlarges the edges of the frame to help make sense of the movies flashback structure. Anderson also blends live action with CGI in a way that recalls the facility with animation he displayed in ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox.""He also shows an unexpected Tim Burton-esque flair for the grotesque. The movie has a surprisingly high body count handiwork of a proto-Nazi biker (Dafoe) willing to kill anyone between him and the missing painting.Ill give Anderson credit for being more witty on the subject of Nazis and art than ""Monuments Men"" - hes more in tune with the bullying hostility behind the Nazi art grab.Yet ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" shares that movies uncomfortable weighting of art and life. ""GBH"" is dedicated to writer Stefan Zweig who (says the romanticized legend) exiled himself from Europe and committed suicide in 1942 rather than see his homeland destroyed by barbarism.""GBH"" seems to concur with that exile - faced with advancing unpleasantness (usually in Andersons world adulthood with its compromises and disappointments and evils) its OK to retreat to another of the directors perfumed Neverlands.Thats one response. For another read Five Came Back the story of how frantically John Ford George Stevens John Huston Frank Capra and William Wyler tried to counter the Nazi threat in their art and failing that to enlist.With war on the horizon they couldnt wait to check out of the Grand Hollywood Hotel.

(Ralph Fiennes) concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel is a bit of a dandy -- every bit. As he strides through the swank cavernous Budapest lobby this aristocrat of the servant class carries himself with perfect posture and a distinct cologne known as eau de panache. His only bequeathable treasures are ""a set of ivory-backed hair brushes and my library of romantic poetry"" whose contents he can quote at length to suit any occasion either tender (""The painters brush touched the inchoate face by ends of nimble bristles ..."") or dire (""A moist black ash dampens the filth of a dung-dark rats nest and mingles with the thick scent of wood rot ...""). His good looks may have calcified in middle age -- glancing at his passport photo he ruefully insists ""I was once considered a great beauty"" -- but Gustave remains irresistible to the hotels endless retinue of ""rich old insecure vain superficial blond needy"" doyennes and returns their devotion with his sexual attention; as he explains ""I go to bed with all my friends."" One of these is the 84-year-old Madame Celine Villeneuve Desguffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) who Gustave avers ""was dynamite in the sack."" When he learns of her sudden death he leaves immediately for her castle fervently kissing Madames rouged corpse and cooing ""Youre looking so well darling I dont know what sort of cream they put on you down at the morgue but I want some."" (MORE Wes Anderson and Bill Murray on The Grand Budapest Hotel) Love and death romance and horror comedy and tragedy duel to an elegant draw in Wes Andersons rich torte of a movie -- perhaps the most seductively European film ever made by a kid from Houston. The Anderson world has always been enclosed an exquisite miniature simulacrum of the real or movie world. His camera style showing figures in an unmoving frame and reaction shots at a regimental 90- or 180-degree angle mimics the viewing of museum installations by a fascinated robot. In rooms or exteriors of impossibly precise ornamental detail the sense of the writer-directors control is complete. Often in these ornate spaces his films characters burst into quirky humanity as they did in Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums Moonrise Kingdom and the stop-motion Fantastic Mr. Fox. In other Anderson films -- The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited -- the air can be stifling and the ""people"" are windup toys he forgot to crank or dolls so stuffed with notions not emotions that they come apart rather than come to life. All those successes and near misses were dry runs for The Grand Budapest Hotel his masterpiece. A dizzyingly complex machine whose workings are a delight to behold the movie has a wry smile for frailties a watchful eye for tyranny and a heart that -- under the circumstances of this dark fanciful tale -- must be called heroic. (MORE Corlisss review of Moonrise Kingdom) We mean a tale within a tale within a tale. The movie which Anderson wrote from a sketch that he and Hugo Guinness prepared some years back begins in the present -- a girl leaving a tribute at the statue of a famous deceased author ""Our national treasure"" -- and promptly flashes back to 1985 when the author (Tom Wilkinson) introduces the story we will see dramatized. His voice-over tells us it is 1968 when his younger self (Jude Law) visited the Grand Budapest and met its owner M. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). To the young author Moustafa relates his memory of Gustave beginning in 1932. Each period is framed in a different aspect ratio variations of widescreen for the more modern scenes the classic 133 for the 30s. When the political tone turns toxic at the climax the glamorous color scheme shifts to ominous monochrome. Like a child with a giant chest of playthings and a boundless imagination Anderson has dreamed up an entire teeming country the former Republic of Zubrowska located ""on the farthest eastern boundary of the European continent."" He knows its capital (Lutz) its currency (klubeks) its highest elevation (Gabelmeisters Peak) and the curious diseases that befall its citizens (the Prussian grippe and scribes fever ""a form of neurasthenia common among the intelligentsia of the time""). The thugs who seize power in Zubrowska wear not the swastika or hammer and sickle but lightning-bolt ZZs. All the particulars in this parallel land -- this imaginary but sociologically pertinent Eastern Europe of the 1930s -- are Andersons invention. So it appears are the poetry excerpts that Gustave declaims to his apprentice the lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori). (MORE Wes Andersons Eight Most Disturbing Scenes) A refugee from a Mideastern country at war Zero learns his vocation directly from Gustave who instructs that ""a lobby boy is completely invisible yet always in sight."" He is to anticipate the whim of all guests and to realize that ""their deepest secrets some of which are frankly rather unseemly will go with us to our graves."" Zero so young he must pencil in his thin mustache each morning is old enough to fall in love with sturdy ethereal Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who works in Herr Mendls pastry shop and who has as Gustave notes ""an enormous birthmark in the shape of Mexico over half her face."" Soon she and Zero are quoting romantic poetry to each other. To signal his approval of their affair Gustave gives Agatha a porcelain pendant and ""five dozen individually wrapped roses in a box the size of a childs coffin."" Amour and mortality are forever playing tag through the corridors of the Grand Budapest Hotel. Zero now Gustaves confidant alerts him to Madame C.V.D.U.T.s death and accompanies him to her home. When the local attorney Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) announces that a codicil to Madames will instructs that Gustave is to receive the priceless painting Boy With Apple her scurvy son Dmitri (Adrien Brody never more dashing or saturnine) and his henchman Jopling (Willem Dafoe in silky sadist mode) cry foul. Gustave and Zero take the painting and vamoose. The rest of the film is in bald outline a caper farce as Gustave escapes from prison with the help of five inmates (including the elaborately tattooed Harvey Keitel) and our two hoteliers are pursued by Dmitri Jopling and State Agent Henckels (Edward Norton). Chases commence on trains motorcycles skis and dog sled. Kovacs the lawyer must flee Jopling while toting his dear dead defenestrated cat in a sack. Fingers and a head are severed from different bodies. The government passes from fascists to communists. Yet the tone of the enterprise remains as sweet and tasty as one of Mendls pastries. (MORE The Saturday Night Live spoof of Wes Anderson movies) Budapest occupies a time and an attitude that have vanished from life and from most fiction. To find its ancient equivalents you would consult Ernst Lubitschs comedies of the 30s and 40s (Trouble in Paradise Ninotchka To Be or Not to Be) made in Hollywood but set in Europe and the 40s and 50s dramas directed by Max Ophuls particularly La Ronde and Letter From an Unknown Woman. That beautiful film about a roue (Louis Jourdan) who impregnates and then forgets a naive young woman (Joan Fontaine) came from a novella by Stefan Zweig the Viennese bon vivant whose life and works inspired this movie. Its a cinch to deduce that Anderson fell in love with Zweigs cosmopolitan cosmos -- a world full of impeccably dressed charmers and scoundrels of hearts to be ruthlessly broken or delicately mended. Little remembered today Zweig born in 1881 was among the most popular and cherished storytellers of his time -- a romantic who flourished between the wars and took the rise of totalitarianism as a personal affront. He died in 1942 after taking sleeping pills with his second wife Lotte Altmann leaving a note that read ""I think it better to conclude in good time and in erect bearing a life in which intellectual labor meant the purest joy and personal freedom the highest good on earth."" When he and Lotte were discovered in their home near Rio they were holding hands. (MORE Our 1942 obit of Stefan Zweig by subscribing to TIME) Gustave inherits Zweigs erect bearing but not his worldview. The writer was an idealist ripe for disillusion; the concierge is a skeptic willing to be surprised by a beneficent gesture. ""You see"" he says to Zero when Henckels does him a favor ""there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity."" Civility certainly adheres to Gustave and his fellow members of the Society of the Crossed Keys (Anderson regulars Bill Murray Bob Balaban Wally Wolodarsky and Waris Ahluwalia plus new recruit Fisher Stevens); the concierges of Europes most fashionable hotels are princes serving queens. The guests are their betters but they are the best. Having dedicated his life to pampering the wealthy and titled Gustave is obliged to believe in the morality of manners. Good people behave courteously and the brutes are brutish. But no brutes are allowed in the Budapest -- until late in the film they move in and take over. ""The beginning of the end of the beginning has begun"" Gustave mourns as he re-enters the hotel now a military post for the ZZs. ""The sad finale played off-key on a broken-down saloon piano in the outskirts of a forgotten ghost town. Id rather not bear witness to such blasphemy."" (He always had a way with so many words.) As Moustafa observes in 1968 ""I think his world had vanished long before he ever entered it. But I will say he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace."" (MORE Wes Anderson on the inspiration of Stefan Zweig) In a way Andersons gift is greater to bring such marvelous grace to the creation and execution of a world that not only vanished but also never existed. Produced for about 20 million with some tax incentives the movie looks like 200 million -- as opposed to say Jack the Giant Slayer which cost 200 million but looked like 20 bucks. Lavishly designed (by Adam Stockhausen) and lovingly shot (by cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman) inside the huge Gorlitzer Warenhaus in Saxony with the Budapest hotels facade a miniature the movie is so gorgeous that you should love it even if you dont like it -- that is even if you think such an intricate construction overshadows all human feeling and ignores any hint of the fun ache and mess of real lives. Yes as you can study in the films illustrated screenplay each aural and visual element is infinitesimally orchestrated. In a funicular chase toward a monastery the squeaking of the cable cars is in perfect tempo with the chanting of monks. (Alexandre Desplats score heavy on the balalaikas is worth enjoying up to and through the closing credits. Dont leave early.) When Kovacs slams a sheaf of legal documents on his desk one small roll of paper bounces impudently and that grace note was surely intended too. But this is not just an amazing contraption though it is that; its a real funny sad movie whose performances are as alert and finely composed as the decor. Andersons actors are not the mannequins of Alain Resnaiss Last Year at Marienbad inching down stately corridors like tuxedoed snails. In this doll house the actors live and breathe speak rapidly and urgently do lots of cool and nasty stuff. (SEE A TIME gallery on the life and career of Alain Resnais) Leading the company and setting its tone is Fiennes. From the start his Gustave -- suave austere sometimes frazzled -- seizes the comic and emotional center. A brilliant troubled man in a preposterous essential job he sees his mission as making people happy and he does so with an efficiency that raises craft to art. So does Wes Anderson.

(Bill Goodykoontz)(Photo From the official Facebook Page of the film)In ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" Wes Anderson creates another of his signature movie universes while telling a tale wrapped inside a tale wrapped inside a tale.Its like a great intricate machine with layers of gears and gizmos that probably ought to break down under their own weight but instead just hum seamlessly along. There is comedy aplenty the trademark Anderson offbeat sensibility and this time around a sense of real tragedy of innocence lost.Its a terrific movie.It begins in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka with a girl placing a flower on the grave of a famous author. Then we see the writer played by Tom Wilkinson about to tell his story. Which he does remembering a time when he stayed at the Grand Budapest Hotel.Now the writer is played by Jude Law who sits down in the fading hotel with Mr. Moustava (F. Murray Abraham) its owner who remembers a time when the place was indeed grand.That grand setting is where most of the film takes place. The young Zero Moustava (played by Tony Revolori) arrives at the hotel and finds a job as a lobby boy working for M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave is flamboyant attentive detail-oriented in the extreme.This extends not just to taking care of the elderly women who stay at the hotel but despite his sexual ambiguity becoming their lover. Its just another element of the go-the-extra-mile customer service he provides.One such client (Tilda Swinton aged and creaky) dies and leaves Gustave a valuable painting. But not so fast Her son the evil Dmitri (Adrien Brody) will have none of it. He convinces the police (led by the ever-reliable Edward Norton) that Gustave has killed his mother and the concierge is put in jail.Zero meanwhile whom Gustave has taken under his wing has fallen for Agatha (Saoirse Ronan); Gustave enlists their help to escape. Its all madcap and ridiculous but also kind of sweet. A string of guest stars (Bill Murray Harvey Keitel Willem Dafoe Jeff Goldblum Owen Wilson Jason Schwartzman and others) show up some briefly.All in good fun. Really good fun in the best possible off-kilter Anderson way -- colors that look like dessert unusual camera movements and other elements weve seen from him before.But theres more to this story.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is set between the world wars at a time when the lifestyle depicted here would soon be extinguished in a nightmare of bloodshed and brutality. Anderson alludes to this at times and at times deals with it more explicitly. A fascist army is on the rise (and at one point takes over the Grand Budapest for its own use) and it is deadly.Anderson isnt concerned with historical accuracy of course. But hes not ignoring history either. He uses Gustave as a symbol of fading luxury probably already past his expiration date hanging on because its the life he knows while knowing it wont last forever.Fiennes is fantastic. It might be that hes so funny because were used to seeing him in serious fare such as ""Schindlers List"" or ""The English Patient."" More likely its because hes a brilliant actor whose timing and sensibilities mesh surprisingly well with Andersons. Its not a pairing you would imagine to be so successful but it really works.So does the movie. Andersons films are too precious for some but for those of us willing to lose ourselves in them theyre a delight. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is no different except that he has added a hint of gravitas to the mix improving the recipe.MORE 5 essential films Wes AndersonQamp;A Ralph Fiennes gets funny in Grand BudapestFamous director-actor pairings Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

The Grand Budapest Hotel (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Grand Budapest Hotel (R) A funny sublime action-adventure from writer-director Wes Anderson. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/21/2014 Editor rating 3.5 The Grand Budapest Hotel is writer-director Wes Andersons first full-on action picture replete with gunfights high-speed chases great escapes and cliffhangers. Because its made by Anderson though the movie still pays meticulous care to stacks of bow-tied pink boxes of macaroons the impossibly deep purple-blue of a concierges jacket and rat-tat-tat dialogue that flies so fast it that you often need a couple of seconds to catch up with the jokes. Detractors of Anderson (Moonrise Kingdom The Royal Tenenbaums Fantastic Mr. Fox) -- and they are legion -- will once again point to the fussiness of the directors attention to meaningless details and colors to his emphasis on perfectly balanced framing and his precise sumptuous set design all things that in the past have sometimes distracted from the main show. Not this time though. The plot of The Grand Budapest Hotel is nestled into three separate time frames like a Russian doll 1985 1965 and 1932. But its the latter that interests Anderson the most when the manager of the eponymous five-star hotel M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his lobby boy (Tony Revolori) embark on a series of adventures in the fictitious Republic of Zubrowka. These involve a wealthy 88-year-old (Tilda Swinton sporting a gray mountain of Marge Simpson hair) her greedy relatives and family (including Adrien Brody and a menacing Willem Dafoe) and an invading army that is never identified as Nazis but sports an emblem that could pass for a redesigned swastika (the spurts of violence that pop up during the film sometimes to startling effect let you know Anderson is not taking this subject matter lightly). Fiennes whose talents have been largely forgotten during the decade he spent playing the noseless Voldemort in the Harry Potter movies has great fun as the suave ladies man and perfectionist who expects nothing but greatness from his charges and knows how to charm a farmer out of his most prized mule. The unquestionable lead of this large cast of Anderson stock players Fiennes hasnt been this animated and energized since well never. Theres great comedy in watching Gustave switch between his various personas always depending on whom hes talking to sometimes at a hairpin turn. Hes equally resourceful cozying up to hardened criminals (including Harvey Keitel) as he is wooing aging matriarchs who melt at his every compliment. Hes the engine that keeps this elaborate contraption chugging and The Grand Budapest Hotel proves the actor should try his hand at comedies more often. But the true star of movie is its director who uses every conceivable filmmaking trick (including at one point some fantastic animation) to make you feel like youre turning the pages of the greatest pop-up book ever written. The Grand Budapest Hotel careens from one situation to the next culminating in a frantic half-hour that feels like a highlight reel from Andersons career. Perhaps in response to a piece in The New Yorker that claimed he took pleasure killing dogs in his movies (Moonrise Kingdom The Royal Tenenbaums The Life Aquatic with Steve Zisso and Fantastic Mr. Fox all featured canine deaths) Anderson kills a cat this time but in a manner so sudden and slapstick that only the most humorless animal lovers wont laugh. That goes for the rest of The Grand Budapest Hotel which dares to confront troubling patches of European history head-on but with a lightness of touch and a frivolous energy so intoxicating the ugly reality lurking at the edges of the screen never spoils the considerable fun. The movie is a flume ride through the imagination of one of the most creative minds making movies today and the pleasure curls your toes. Also be ready to crave some macaroons.

Martin Scali This image released by Fox Searchlight shows Tom Wilkinson Tony Revolori center and Owen Wilson right in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel ."" (AP Photo/Fox Searchlight) Like a fine hotel the world of Wes Anderson has many rooms with a recognizable motif. His meticulously crafted films unfold on symmetrical stages with vaguely dated decor. Depending on whom you ask his precious realms resemble doll houses or human zoos. For Andersons army of acolytes ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a lovely place to bunk with hauntingly familiar music lulling them to Dreamland.The tune is a medley of Andersons greatest hits overdubbed onto a screwball heist caper. The director has re-assembled many of his repertory players -- Bill Murray Jason Schwartzman Jeff Goldblum Ed Norton -- and given them a surprising new playmate. As Monsieur Gustave the courtly concierge of the titular abode in pre-Holocaust central Europe Ralph Fiennes is a delight. Gustave keeps the pastry-pink hotel running like a Swiss kitchen. At his side is the lobby boy a war orphan called Zero (Tony Revolori) who tells the tale from a decades-hence perspective.Order devolves into comic chaos when one of Gustaves many lovers the octogenarian Madame D. (Tilda Swinton in old-age makeup) drops dead after secretly bequeathing a priceless painting to Gustave. Her presumptive heir Dmitri (Adrien Brody) is outraged and he sends his thug (Willem Dafoe) to wrest the painting from the fleeing Gustave. The detours include a brutal prison where the bisexual concierge charms the inmates before a madcap escape and an Alpine monastery where Gustave and Zero don skis for a getaway worthy of a ""Pink Panther"" flick.Anderson tips his cap to directors from Ernst Lubitsch to Alfred Hitchcock but we never forget whos pulling the puppet strings. And when his stylistic excesses threaten to give us a sugar-rich headache he leavens the confection with a dollop of feeling as when Gustave pledges lifelong friendship to the loyal lobby boy and when Zero falls in love with a bakery girl (Saoirse Ronan) whose creations are the key to the prison escape. Notwithstanding the young-love subplot the film is not as emotionally radiant as Andersons previous gem the teen romance ""Moonrise Kingdom."" Teetering like a wedding cake beneath the gathering clouds of war ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has unexpectedly complex flavors filtered through several sieves of nostalgia. (As the curtain rises a contemporary reader honors a writer from the 80s who learned in the 60s about the Zero of the 30s.)

"Up in the Droll Hotel Wes Andersons (Minor Precious But Really Kind of Great) Latest << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Up in the Droll Hotel Wes Andersons (Minor Precious But Really Kind of Great) Latest Fox Searchlight Movies March 7 2014 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print Early in Wes Andersons The Grand Budapest Hotel a dowager countess dies under suspicious circumstances leaving behind a will whose 635 codicils and amendments barely fit into an amusingly overstuffed file box. One additional amendment is then revealed because the plot demands it -- but also Im guessing because 636 is a more appealingly symmetrical number. Even by the exacting aesthetic standards of WesWorld this is a very tidy movie. Its hardly the first time Andersons pinned actors to the center of the screen like bugs on a slide or moved the camera almost exclusively in 90- or 180-degree whip-pans but hes never done it more. The movie set in the fictional Austro-Hungarian enclave of Zubrowka was shot in a real place -- Germany -- but you wouldnt know it. Its a series of lovely tableaus that feel even more hermetic and purged of accident and real-world messiness than 2009s Fantastic Mr. Fox -- the one Anderson directed by emailing instructions to a team of puppeteers in England from his pied-a-terre in Montmartre. I dont mean ""tidy"" as an insult exactly. If you factor out the framing sequence and the sequence that frames the framing sequence and the wordless prologue involving a young girl visiting a statue of one of the framing-sequence characters (go ahead and pre-mark ""overhead shot of library book being opened"" and ""beret"" on your Wes Anderson bingo card everybody) whats left is a farce and farces are supposed to be tidy. Farce is the Hardest Geometry Problem in the World of comedy subgenres. In Grand Budapest the variables in the equation include a dedicated and exacting bisexual hotel concierge whose commitment to servicing wealthy guests occasionally transcends the traditional definition of hospitality the concierges young ""lobby boy"" protege and an apparently priceless painting called Boy With Apple. The concierge Gustave H. is played with campy verve by Ralph Fiennes; a soulful 17-year-old actor named Tony Revolori plays Zero the lobby boy who romances Agatha the bakers daughter (Saoirse Ronan) and comes to Monsieur H.s aid after the countesss conniving son (Adrien Brody) frames him for her murder. Fiennes Revolori and Ronan are new to this world; nearly everyone else in the movie has worked with Anderson before once or many times. In a Christmas pageant Anderson has created parts for just about everybody else in the American Empirical repertory company from Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman to longtime Anderson pals like Waris Ahluwalia and Wallace Wolodarsky. This troupe is one of the most likable groups of actors ever assembled and its nice to see them all together again just hanging out in 1930s Europe doing accents only if they feel like it. Theres even a kind of getting-the-band-back-together montage in the middle of the film. I wont spoil it because its a fun run of jokes -- but its also exactly the kind of whimsy for whimsys sake Andersons detractors have long accused him of trafficking in. When previous Anderson movies speed-briefed us on Max Fischers extracurricular activities or Margot Tenenbaums sexual history we were learning something important about a character; with Budapests characters theres not a whole lot to learn. Nor is there much real tension between them Despite his inexperience Zero has completely won over Gustave within a scene or two. The course of Zero and Agathas love runs fairly smoothly. We know Zero survives because he grows up to be F. Murray Abraham who narrates this story over dinner to a sad young literary man (Jude Law) at the Grand Budapest circa 1968. And although Fiennes plays Gustave as a vain greedy hustler whos cultivated good manners for the same reason he douses himself in a fine perfume called LAir de Panache his innocence is never in doubt; Anderson gives him an alibi immediately depriving us of the chance to wonder even for a little while if he actually offed the old lady. On the other hand we get a bald Harvey Keitel with prison tats and a funicular (Seriously how has the railway-obsessed Anderson only just now gotten around to making a film that includes a funicular arguably the most Andersonian mode of transportation ever devised by man?) And yet -- and this is a big ""And yet"" -- this isnt a bad movie and it might not even be an unimportant one in the Anderson canon. The chipper vulgarity of the script (conceived by Anderson and the artist Hugo Guinness with credited inspiration from the stories of the forgotten Austrian writer Stefan Zweig) and a few bursts of surprisingly bloody comic violence keep it from coming off like a mere confection. The jokes land. And in its own silly artificial way its the first Anderson film to acknowledge the existence of a world outside its own little toy box and to ground its characters nostalgia in something resembling actual historical reality. The young-Zero/Gustave story takes place in 1932 between the wars. When a police inspector (Edward Norton) does Zero a favor Gustave sighs ""There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse we once called humanity"" and it seems like goofy hyperbole. Then war breaks out and the fascists show up in Zubrowka in their long black leather coats hanging their Nazi-ish ""ZZ"" banners from the Grand Budapests balconies. The sun really is about to set on the Old World whose gentility Gustave embodies and barbarism really is whats coming. When Zweig committed suicide in Brazil in 1942 he left a note that made reference to ""my spiritual home Europe having destroyed itself""; the destruction remains off-camera in Andersons film but when we see the Grand Budapest in 1968 the lobbys undergone a drab Communist-era makeover and the front-desk service is deplorable. In the end Anderson lets retro production design do the work of imbuing his movie with a sense of loss which is very Wes Anderson of him.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Mar 14 2014 Culture Is it possible to make a semi-tragic wartime noir thats shot primarily in shades of pastel?Judging from Wes Andersons latest signature whimsy The Grand Budapest Hotel the answer is yes. By turns a whodunit a prison-break movie and an ode to high-end hotel conciergery the movie is among Andersons daffiest to date. (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou has it beat by a nose.) Yet for all its visual baubles and deadpan comedy it is shot through with nostalgia melancholy and deep echoes of historic loss. Im not sure that a confectionary fable set against so bleak a backdrop ought to succeed. But for me it did brilliantly.Related Story The Oscars in 2015 Very Very Early Predictions for Next Years Awards The film opens with a series of narratives nested within narratives like Russian dolls. A girl in the present day pays tribute at the grave of a Central European author. Flash backward in time to the author himself (Tom Wilkinson) in 1985 explaining the genesis of his book The Grand Budapest Hotel. As a younger man (now played by Jude Law who also inherits voiceover duties from Wilkinson) he had visited a hotel by that same name in 1968 a semi-defunct and virtually unpopulated hulk in the fictional nation of Zubrowka that had once served as a glamorous mountain retreat for the uppermost of the upper classes. There he met the aging owner Mr. Mustapha (F. Murray Abraham who will take over narration duty for the bulk of the film) who described to him the hotels shimmering heyday in the 1930s.Back then Mr. Mustapha was a mere lobby boy known as ""Zero"" (Tony Revolori) the pupil and protege of celebrated concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave is a prim and fussy perfectionist--copiously perfumed yet notably filthy of tongue--whose devotion to service includes well servicing the many rich elderly ladies among the hotels clientele. (""She was 84"" Zero exclaims in disbelief when Gustave reveals one of his paramours. ""Ive had older"" Gustave replies breezily.)When one among Gustaves coterie of intimate acquaintances Madame M. (Tilda Swinton unrecognizable under wizening prosthetics) passes away Gustave is summoned to her wake where he discovers that she has bequeathed to him an invaluable painting entitled Boy with Apple. Madame M.s covetous progeny take this news poorly in particular her malevolent son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) who tasks his homicidally inclined bodyguard (Willem Dafoe) with reacquiring the portrait. Plots and counter-plots ensue involving theft and murder imprisonment and flight secret societies and missing wills.The comedy in The Grand Budapest Hotel is among the broadest yet undertaken by Anderson.Andersons customary affectations are all very much in evidence the marzipan palette; the finicky meticulous compositions; the sentimental attachment to bygone relics here ranging from macaroons and rotary phones to funicular trams and striped prison outfits. Also scattered ornamentally throughout the film are small roles for a great many members of Andersons extended troupe including (in addition to those already cited) Jeff Goldblum Edward Norton Harvey Keitel Bill Murray Bob Balaban and Jason Schwartzman. Mathieu Amalric and Saoirse Ronan also make appearances as an ill-fated domestic and as Zeros oddly birthmarked love interest respectively. Though few of these performers are offered very much to do they complete Andersons set dressing with great aplomb.As the fastidious yet feisty Gustave Fiennes is a delight. Whether he is engineering the perfect stay for his hotel guests or making new friends in prison there is an imperviousness to his solicitude. For all his delicate mannerisms--he addresses strangers as ""chaps"" and ""darlings""--Gustave possesses an underlying strength and dignity that suggest a farcical variation on Don Cheadles performance as Paul Rusesabagina in Hotel Rwanda. (Fiennes obtained the role of Gustave after Johnny Depp dropped out leaving unanswered for now the question of whether an Anderson-Depp pairing would prove sublime or intolerable.) As the young Zero Revolori is primarily the straight man and he fulfills this obligation expertly another in a series of young performers (along with Schwartzman in Rushmore and Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward in Moonrise Kingdom) ably directed by Anderson. And as our narrator F. Murray Abraham reminds again as he did last year in Inside Llewyn Davis of the Hollywood vagaries that allowed someone of his extraordinary talent to all but vanish from the big screen for three decades.The comedy in The Grand Budapest Hotel is among the broadest yet undertaken by Anderson--it includes for instance a cat being thrown out a window--and it hurtles toward the viewer with reckless velocity. There is much running and fighting and yelling and shooting. (And yes sledding.) But amid the frenzied hubbub there are intimations of a darker sadder history unfolding--in the dilapidation of the communist-era hotel in the frame narrative and in the multiplying gangs of 1930s-era military police in the central story. This subtext becomes explicit as the tale of Gustave H. concludes with an unhappy swerve and we return to the present-day girl paying her graveside respects under a leaden sky. For any who might have missed the cues an onscreen coda describes the film as ""inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig"" the Austrian Jewish writer who committed suicide in 1942 at the age of 60.Those who are not fans of Wes Andersons work--and some who are--may find this appropriation awkward or unearned. And indeed there are no Nazis or Soviets per se in Andersons fable any more than Zubrowka is a genuine place. But the mid-century sorrows of the real world tether the frivolities of Andersons make-believe one lending gravity to the wistfulness and the air of fading innocence that have been among the principal themes of his career. The Grand Budapest Hotel may not be Andersons best film--though it is among them--but it is unexpectedly perhaps his most grown up.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

If a movie can be elegantly zany this wholly imaginative assured fable of a legendary concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) his protege Zero (Tony Revolori) and the murder of a countess is it. A story within a story ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" unfolds between the two world wars with fascism on the rise. But the setting is the lovingly wrought fantasy realm of the Republic of Zubrowka. Bill Murray Owen Wilson and Bob Balaban make cameo appearances. Then there are the actors taking on more central roles in this ornate yet pleasing caper Adrien Brody Jeff Goldblum Tilda Swinton and Edward Norton for starters. But it is Fiennes and Revoloris special chemistry as mentor and apprentice that makes something endearing of the madness. F. Murray Abraham gives a melancholy countenance to the elder Zero who shares the saga of the hotel and its vain and charming concierge. Jude Law is the Young Writer a lonesome scribe and hotel guest who in 1965 became the beneficiary of Zero and Gustaves saga. Its a story that includes a family bent on an inheritance; a beguiling pastry maker (Saoirse Ronan); cops like the upstanding military officer Albert Henckels (Edward Norton) and cads in the persons of the countess son Dimitri (Brody enjoyingly sinister) and his ""private inquiry agent."" Willem Dafoe plays the henchman sporting black leather and the underbite of an English bulldog. Fair warning A cat will be dispatched. Gustave had quite the way with the hotels wealthy guests including but not limited to the 84-year-old Countess Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxi (Swinton in impressive aging makeup). There is something both haughty and humble in Gustaves take on life and ethics. And Fiennes deft and daft turn keeps every gesture just this side of chaotic as the murder mystery hits its fevered pitch -- after a prison break no less. Dry wit abounds. And ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the kind of idiosyncratic undertaking that nudges a return to its creators filmography from ""Rushmore"" to the wonderful ""Royal Tenenbaums"" from ""Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" to the enchanting ""Moonrise Kingdom."" Alexandre Desplat tapped a 50-member balalaika orchestra for the buoyant moody score. And cinematographer Robert Yeoman gives the film a palette that suggests a musical of yore. Indeed there is much ""of yore"" here. Yet this whipped-up confection could be made only by this peculiar director working at the height of his gift in this particular moment.

Murray Abraham Tilda Swinton Tony Revolori Classification 14A Year 2014 Country USA Germany Language English French The hotel that is the central location in Wes Andersons latest film is a massive two-toned-pink multilayered wedding cake of a building in a mountainous retreat in the fictitious country of Zubrowka (named after a Polish vodka). In the story within a story within a story that takes place there the hotel serves as a sort of gaudy museum to a lost era. Video Video Weekend movie pick Wes Andersons latest (possibly best) film The Grand Budapest Hotel Bill Murray and Bruce Willis talk about Moonrise at Cannes. Joel Ryan / AP Movies Video Moonrise Kingdom opens at Cannes Anderson is a miniaturist whose films often seem inspired by the novelty shop and the confectioners counter and fans of his work from Rushmore to Moonrise Kingdom will find the usual pop-up-book visual style and precision humour but The Grand Budapest Hotel his eighth feature takes us somewhere new into literary and historical territory.From the start its clear Anderson is working with a new sophistication both in the vocabulary and structure of the films voiceover narrations. We begin within a nested series of stories. A young woman visits the grave of a favourite writer. The writer (Tom Wilkinson) appears circa mid-eighties offering a video memoir. The memoir takes us to 1968 where the same man (now played by Jude Law) describes how he was suffering from ""Scribes disease"" and sought a restorative stay at a rundown Alpine spa the Grand Budapest Hotel.After a few days he meets the mysterious owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who over dinner tells the story of how he came to acquire the building. We move back again to 1932 (each chronological transition is signalled by a different aspect ratio) when a young Zero (Tony Revolori) sporting a pencil-drawn mustache to look older first becomes a lobby boy at the hotel under the supervision of the exacting heavily perfumed concierge Gustave H. played by Ralph Fiennes in one of the freest and most colourful characters of his career.Officially bisexual but mostly opportunistic Gustave doesnt mind providing extraspecial services for his older clientele with a preference for anyone who is ""rich old insecure vain superficial and blond."" One of his favourites is the doting 84-year-old Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis or Madame D. played by Tilda Swinton in a cocoon of makeup and prosthetics.The Grand Budapest Hotel is ultimately a murder story - both an internal whodunit and by extrapolation the story of the war to come. After a revivifying stay under Gustaves ministrations Madame D. returns to her estate and promptly dies. Gustave orders Zero to accompany him to the funeral and the reading of the will where they learn that Madame has left Gustave a valuable painting. Her nasty family members led by Madames raging son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) are determined to steal it back. A flipping photo albums worth of characters make their hasty appearances a butler (Mathieu Amalric) the executor of the will (Jeff Goldblum) a violent family-employed assassin (Willem Dafoe).Amid these various scrapes arrests and threats Gustave remains unflappable a believer in style even in degraded conditions. The character is a type but he also appears to have a specific inspiration. Andersons film is dedicated to the memory of Stefan Zweig the prolific Jewish-Austrian novelist playwright journalist and biographer who was a friend to Arthur Schnitzler and Sigmund Freud collaborator of Richard Strauss a social butterfly and a man almost constantly on the run. Zweig is the inspiration not only for the literary tone of The Grand Budapest Hotel but for the character of Gustave H. a fastidious yet louche observer of middle-European high society in its final blaze of glory.As a whole The Grand Budapest Hotel has recognizable parallels to Ernst Lubitschs comedy To Be or Not to Be except that the Nazis arent called Nazis here. The military police are called the ZZ and are supervised by a tall-hatted gentlemanly commandant (Edward Norton). The ZZ stop trains and demand passports and eventually put Gustave in jail where his social skills prove a hit even among the hardened criminals in their cartoonish striped prison suits. Gustave is aided by Zero and Zeros new fiancee Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) a girl with a Mexico-shaped birthmark on her cheek who works at Mendls bakery an outfit that makes pastries as pink and detailed as the Grand Budapest Hotel itself.The second half of The Grand Budapest Hotel turns into an action movie though its so zippy and abstract that it erases the line between thriller and Wile E. Coyote cartoon. Along with the madcap action comes violence (a severed head chopped-off fingers) and eventually the intrusion of events too similar to the real history to ignore which throws cold water on this funny fever dream. Throughout Anderson invites you to simply look at how densely and precisely he has filled his frames from the candy-coloured production design to the fetishistic precise costumes to the minimal dance of the camera over this intricately invented world. Its a world that never quite existed in real life but that bursts forth from the frames of Andersons melancholic deeply affectionate film.

Playing an Old World charmer with clipped diction and a deliciously foul mouth Fiennes making his debut with Andersons stock company falls into lockstep with the filmmakers unmistakable universe.His M. Gustave is the peacock-proud concierge of the title location an Anderson confection of pinks and purples. He finds himself in a pickle over a stolen painting a dead countess (Tilda Swinton unrecognizable in octogenarian makeup) and her vengeful family led by a pair of crypto-Nazi sons (Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe).It always feels silly to summarize Anderson plots because they so often seem beside the point. His movies are playgrounds for his aesthetic and cultural fancies some obscure some widely beloved. Obscure the Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig enough of an influence here to get an ""inspired by"" shoutout at the top of the closing credits. I dont know Zweig. But I do know the continental film delights of Ernst Lubitsch and Max Ophuls and I fell swiftly for the tributes Anderson serves up here.Andersons childlike delight in cinematic artifice can feel overly precious but in The Grand Budapest Hotel it tickles from start to finish. He creates a masterpiece of matte paintings and miniatures in the service of a bygone world that really existed only in movies in the first place. He uses three different aspect ratios -- the proportional relationship between the screens width and height -- for the films three distinct time periods and his decisions make perfect sense. Hes like a bawdy kid playing with a particularly advanced train set.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a movie lovers movie and it doesnt care who knows it. If youve seen Grand Hotel or Grand Illusion or The Earrings of Madame de... youll appreciate the loving sense of homage. But theres also a wider emotional resonance in the relationship between M. Gustave and his young lobby boy (Tony Revolori) and in the feeling that M. Gustave is a man out of time an anachronism in his own cracked palace.Among Andersons chief talents is his ability to convey the joy he feels in making a movie. He must have had a blast with The Grand Budapest Hotel.THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (A-)Directed by Wes Anderson. R (language some sexual content and violence). 99 mins.

"The Grand Budapest Hotel a delicious cinema cake Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Grand Budapest Hotel a delicious cinema cake ReviewEight features into a career of clockwork whimsy Texas writer/director Wes Anderson crafts his masterwork with The Grand Budapest Hotel an early candidate for 2014s best film.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 13 2014The Grand Budapest HotelStarring Ralph Fiennes Tony Revolori Saoirse Ronan Edward Norton Bill Murray F. Murray Abraham Jude Law Tilda Swinton Willem Dafoe Adrien Brody and Jeff Goldblum. Written and directed by Wes Anderson. 100 minutes. Opens March 14 at Queensway and Varsity Theatres. 14AExotic pastries play an absurdly significant role in Wes Andersons The Grand Budapest Hotel but it all makes perfect sense.The entire movie is like a giant elaborately decorated cake created by this most exacting of film craftsmen.Article Continued BelowAnd how tasty it isRalph Fiennes left and Tony Revolori are newcomers to the Wes Anderson family of actors.Eight features into a career of artisanal whimsy the Texas writer/director has ""baked"" his masterwork an early candidate for 2014s best film. Every carefully arranged image is a visual treat and a comic delight set to Alexandre Desplats jaunty score.Andersons pink-frosted retreat sits amongst the central European mountains of the Republic of Zubrowka a place you wont find via Google Earth.Through these vast doors pass many familiar faces -- people like Bill Murray Owen Wilson Tilda Swinton Jason Schwartzman and Bob Balaban variously seen in Bottle Rocket through Moonrise Kingdom Andersons previous films.But the most engaging and amusing of them is new to Andersons antics Ralph Fiennes.Hes Monsieur Gustave H. the concierge of the Grand Budapest a man of fastidious manner and reckless charm. Gustave pleasures his wealthy female clientele from lobby to bedroom their age and decrepitude being no obstacle to swinging.His treats include servings of divine confections made by Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) a sweetly innocent baker who catches the eye of Gustaves loyal protege lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori a casting find).Gustaves favourite guest is octogenarian Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) who positively adores him -- and who wouldnt? But she fears unspecified treachery as she prepares to return home to her grasping son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and other ungrateful offspring.Her suspicions will soon be realized and Gustave will be drawn against his will into nasty business which includes a merry chase for this pictures MacGuffin a priceless Renaissance painting called Boy With Apple.The year is 1932 notably in-between world wars at the dawn of something very much like German fascism. Darkness is descending upon all of Europe evident in the growing number of rude men in uniforms bearing ominous Nazi-like symbols (theyre called ""Zig-Zags"") who have no patience for civility.The tale is actually told over four time periods the others being 1968 1985 and the present day. Anderson and cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman use different camera aspect ratios -- variously turning the screen square rectangle and stretch rectangle -- to subliminally and quaintly indicate the passage of time and how our perspectives change along with it.Current time and 1985 are the briefest stretches featuring Tom Wilkinson as an author explaining the hotels history which he has turned into a book.He beckons us to 1968 whereupon the younger version of himself played by Jude Law as a writer seeking a rest cure from ""scribes fever"" finds the nearly empty Grand Budapest greatly diminished from its past glories.An elderly gentleman named Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) offers over dinner to tell the young writer about the fabled establishment a place he sadly observes is now ""too decadent for modern tastes.""Thus begins the films main narrative of the early 30s the era of Gustave who discovers to his dismay but not his defeat that terrible things are occurring in his well-ordered universe.Barbarians are indeed at the gates but Gustave has been too busy to notice. Now he must clear his good name as Anderson wheels us through a madcap tribute to cinema past that includes genre hat-tips to screwball comedy prison drama caper movie war romance road film and more.As zany as it all sounds -- and just wait until you meet the Society of the Crossed Keys a secret concierge fraternity -- theres an undercurrent of melancholy to The Grand Budapest Hotel that indicates how far Anderson has progressed from the studied irony of his early films. He co-wrote the script with Hugo Guinness a British artist.The impeccable production design has always been there in Andersons films but you can sense a further maturing of the storytelling that began with Moonrise Kingdom Andersons 2012 childhood reverie. When Gustave laments the slide of civility he speaks sincerely and across the decades.Theres a lot going on but everything comes marvelously to fruition with The Grand Budapest Hotel the grandest of treats from Wes Anderson.

Murray Abraham Adrien Brody Jeff Goldblum Willem Dafoe Edward Norton Saoirse Ronan Directed by Wes Anderson Rated R for language some sexual content and violence Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Playing University Town Center (See movie times)The quick hitWes Andersons latest crackpot fantasia this time about a central European grand hotel between world wars is more fascinating than his previous films but just as flat. Grade C+ The art of living well crumbles under the boorish taste and horrendous behavior of thugs and fascists in Wes Andersons latest vaudevillian contraption ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" The movie is a dervish of farcical activity. Its two heroes are M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) the exacting concierge of the hotels glory days (the 1920s and 30s) and Zero (Tony Revolori) his lobby-boy protege. They strive to outwit a hideous family determined to rob Gustave of his rightful inheritance - an invaluable artwork called ""Boy With Apple."" They get help from some scrappy convicts (Harvey Keitel among them) a resourceful cabal of hotel superintendents known as the Society of the Crossed Keys (including hilarious deadpan eminences like Bill Murray and Bob Balaban) and a gifted baker named Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who is also Zeros first love. As the pursuit consumes Gustave he fails to fully comprehend the signs of a burgeoning fascist menace. After confronting ominous soldiers on a train he concludes inadequately ""This could be a tricky war and a long dry spell in the hotel trade."" Later he mistakenly bets that his lavish grace and politesse can protect him. History changes beyond the reach of these main characters. The movie unspools in some private pocket of the directors imagination. A screenwriter friend of mine once complained about films that dont require an audience and would go on just the same without anyone looking or laughing at them. Thats how I feel about Andersons pictures. Theyre comical without actually being funny inventive without being freely playful momentous without being dramatic. The emotional oxygen that would ignite them gets smothered in self-conscious cleverness. Theyre the art house equivalent of the glued-up mega-city in ""The Lego Movie."" But Anderson lures moviegoers with the near-charm and almost-profundity of his extravagant quirkiness. To some becoming an Anderson fan can mean being virtuous and hip like joining an artistic Society of the Crossed Keys. At least in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" his ambition is invigorating. Anderson constructs halls of funhouse mirrors offering an elusive black-comic distillation of 20th-century central European history from bourgeois decadence to fascism to socialism and on to an ambiguous future. Zero played by F. Murray Abraham in 1968 when hes known as Mr. Moustafa tells the main story to a writer (Jude Law) vacationing in the fictional country of Zubrowka. There the government has turned most ""properties and holdings"" like the Grand Budapest Hotel into ""common property."" Anderson even frames the framing story two times over first with a fetching young woman in a present-day park reading a book called ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" near a statue of the author then with the writer in 1985 (played by Tom Wilkinson instead of Law) who tries to explain his literary life as his son fires a toy Luger. Wedded to the hotels layer-cake look the films design recalls the virtuosity of old-fashioned pop-up books - but without the surprise and innocence. At first Fiennes powers of articulation are amusing. He makes lists of orders sound like nonsense poetry ""Run to the cathedral of Santa Maria Christiana in Brucknerplatz. Buy one of the plain half-length candles and take back four kublecks in change. Light it in the sacristy say a brief Rosary then go to Mendls and get me a Courtesan au chocolat. If theres any money left give it to the crippled shoeshine boy."" But in the end all Fiennes can generate is aesthetic attitude - which makes him just a smidgen more substantial than the other characters who merely strike and sustain poses. Anderson has cited Stefan Zweigs fiction as an influence. He pales before the example of Max Ophuls Zweigs greatest film adapter. In ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" Tilda Swinton plays an aged grande dame who like many guests thrives on Gustaves sexual favors. She bears the name ""Madame D"" - a reference to the heroine of Ophuls masterpiece ""The Earrings of Madame De"" a scintillating tragicomedy about lives ruled by 19th-century high-society manners and honor based on a novel by Louise de Vilmorin. Just as great is Ophuls adaptation of Zweigs novella ""Letter From an Unknown Woman"" which contains a sequence that shames the artifice of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" In Ophuls film a master pianist (Louis Jourdan) takes a woman who has secretly adored him (Joan Fontaine) on a carnival fake-train ride. Painted scenes of Venice or Switzerland powered by a man on a stationary bike fly by the window of their car. She expresses her passion and he sparks to it. Your heart beats faster as Ophuls pulls his camera closer to the lovers. In an Anderson film the people would be as flat as the backdrop.

Photo Credit Fox Searchlight Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The adventures of a snooty concierge and his faithful bellboy in war-torn Eastern Europe. Rated R (language sexual content brief gore) BOTTOM LINE Writer-director Wes Anderson (""Moonrise Kingdom"") delivers another stylish charmer this time grounded in the tender story of an unlikely but undying friendship. CAST Ralph Fiennes Tony Revolori Jude Law Saoirse Ronan LENGTH 140 Wes Andersons ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" unfolds in no fewer than six narratives and perhaps as many points in time. Keep up It begins with an earnest girl reading a novel whose Author (played at different ages by Tom Wilkinson and Jude Law) is recalling a dinner with Zero Moustafa a former bellboy at the faded Grand Budapest Hotel. Even Zero -- played by both F. Murray Abraham and the appealing young newcomer Tony Revolori -- is telling another story that of his beloved boss a debauched but noble-hearted concierge named M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Andersons movies -- from ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" to ""Moonrise Kingdom"" -- often seem nostalgic for a bygone era that the 44-year-old director is too young to remember and here its the 1930s the end of empires and aristocracies. (The movie was inspired by Viennese writer Stefan Zweig who killed himself in 1942.) Like most Anderson films this one has a screwball plot charm and an air of longing. But the tender friendship between the wide-eyed Zero and the worldly Gustave gives this movie an emotional core that isnt always an Anderson priority. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Set in Zubrowka a pretend Eastern European nation on the brink of a pretend war (the invaders are mirror-image SS officers with ""ZZ"" armbands) ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is another visual triumph from Anderson. Half the pleasure is in its carefully arranged objects -- grand chandeliers gleaming woodwork once-modern signage -- but it also brims with terrific actors. Along with Fiennes pitch-perfect as a tragicomic dandy a partial cast list includes Tilda Swinton as Gustaves octogenarian lover (""Ive had older"" he says proudly) Adrien Brody as her vengeful son Saoirse Ronan as Zeros loyal girlfriend and -- playing the members of a secret concierge fraternity -- Bill Murray Owen Wilson and Bob Balaban. Anderson may be overemploying his stylistic quirks -- rapid-fire dialogue whip-pan reaction shots -- but ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" feels like one of his most definitive films. Of its many endearing figures Gustave is surely closest to the directors heart. ""Truth be told"" Zero says of his friend ""I think his world was gone long before he entered it.""

"Grand Budapest Hotel movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW The Grand Budapest Hotel  1/2 The Grand Budapest Hotel Fox Searchlight Pictures Ralph Fiennes in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" Ralph Fiennes in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" (Fox Searchlight Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Ever since the moment in ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996) when Luke Wilsons character paused during a robbery of his own boyhood home to straighten a toy soldier on a bedroom shelf writer-director Wes Anderson announced his intentions as an artist of serenely extreme exactitude.This is a filmmaker working in varying degrees of visual stylization who operates within precise notions of how the universe of his imagining will proceed in terms of story and how his characters will operate within that universe one carefully composed shot at a time. Andersons newest film is many things. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" qualifies as his most exotically remote achievement in terms of locale; most of it takes place in a fictitious Eastern European province in the early 1930s.Its also one of Andersons cleverest and most gorgeous movies dipping just enough of a toe in the real world -- and in the melancholy works of its acknowledged inspiration the late Austrian writer Stefan Zweig -- to prevent the whole thing from floating off into the ether of minor whimsy. I would call ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" major whimsy. Its a confection with bite featuring an ensemble led by the invaluable Ralph Fiennes here allowed to exercise his farceurs wiles. Anyone who dares to call Andersons work actor-proof would do well to imagine this film with an inferior or ham-fisted performance at its center. Even when the dialogue slips into jokey anachronisms or less-than-sparkling repartee Fiennes portrayal of M. Gustave the finest hotel concierge known to humankind lends an exceptional deftness to the results.Anderson treats the ravages of the 20th century as a series of echoes through time. The movie begins in the late 1970s with an unnamed author (Tom Wilkinson) taping an interview and relaying the story of his book about a certain now-vanished hotel in a spa town high in the mountains. Zwoop and were back to the 1960s when the same writer (now played by Jude Law) arrives at the Grand Budapest in its fading communist era of disrepair.At the hotel the writer meets the owner played by F. Murray Abraham who relates the improbable tale of how he came to own the Grand Budapest and how he started out decades earlier as a lobby boy. Anderson who co-wrote the story with Hugo Guinness skips back and forth in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" but mainly were in 1932 in the palaces heyday between the wars. The plot -- and theres a lot of it -- concerns the death of one of the concierges aged lovers (Tilda Swinton giving Wendy Hillers turn in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" a run for her money). She has left to M. Gustave a priceless painting which her greedy heirs want very badly.From there Anderson treats the events as eccentric elaborate moves on a chessboard not in fast-motion exactly but with each development (Gustaves time in prison; his breakout; the young lobby boys romance with the hotel baker) a part of an increasingly threatening game. With his quick smile and avid expression of never missing a trick Fiennes keeps the top spinning. He resembles deliberately the real-life Viennese dandy and public figure Zweig who was born in 1881 and committed suicide with his wife while in Brazilian exile in 1942. In Zweigs autobiography ""The World of Yesterday"" he writes about the ""hermetic isolation"" of the exiles life moving here and settling there always amid a ""smouldering uneasiness."" ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" concerns among others the lobby boy Zero played by newcomer Tony Revolori. Like Zweig he is a refugee. Saoirse Ronan is Zeros beloved Agatha; the rest of the cast is so rich in talent itd take a few paragraphs to include all the worthy supporting turns each speaking in a differently accented English ranging from Harvey Keitels Brooklynese convict to Edward Nortons officious police chief a storm trooper in sheeps clothing outfitted with a mustache borrowed from Adolphe Menjou.Anderson is attempting a tricky magic act here. His made-up land of Zubrowka which happens also to be a brand of Polish vodka draws upon the sort of Mittel-European never-never-land atmospherics favored by the early Ernst Lubitsch. (The name of the local paper The Trans-Alpine Yodel.) But were also dealing with encroaching fascism even if nobody speaks of Nazis in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" Some of the violence is jarring particularly a scene in which Willem Dafoes rotten-toothed henchman stalks a lawyer played by Jeff Goldblum in and around the local art museum. The visualization of the sequence pulls elements from a similar scene in Alfred Hitchcocks ""Torn Curtain."" Other shots those of death squads as seen from the inside of a train are reminiscent of earlier Hitchcock films from his between-the-wars British period particularly ""Sabotage.""Throughout Anderson revels in the mechanics and the delightful fakery of moviemaking illusions gone by. The scenes set aboard the funicular railway resemble the climax of Carol Reeds ""Night Train to Munich."" A frenzied chase on skis blending stop-motion animation and miniatures is breathlessly funny like one of the action scenes in Andersons own ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" Each of the time frames within the film is treated to its own aspect ratio The 30s scenes are framed in boxy old-school 1.371 while the gone-to-seed 60s passages are shown in widescreen 2.401. The 70s bits bookending the other parts are shot in 1.851. Anderson and cinematographer Robert Yeoman manage these shifts elegantly.Sometimes the frivolity feels misplaced. But its something of a miracle this obsessively diagramed project has a human pulse of any kind. Its getting at the seriousness of its themes by way of the back door or the servants entrance. The actors give the brittle material life mostly comic but dramatic when needed. The familiar pictorial techniques -- the swish pans pivoting 90 or 180 degrees capturing in a single shot action reaction and reaction to the reaction -- are present and accounted for. The dolly shots intricate but not ostentatious sweep us into the world of M. Gustaves domain. Time may reorder his latest in my affections and I dont love or even like all of Andersons eight features certainly not in the same way. But ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" may be his best since ""Rushmore."" Its a mirage of what was. In Zweigs posthumously published ""Chess Story"" he told a story of a chess master dedicating himself to a monomaniacal pursuit. ""The more one limits oneself the closer one is to the infinite"" Zweig wrote. ""These people as unworldly as they seem burrow like termites into their own particular material to construct in miniature a strange and utterly individual image of the world.""

Starring Ralph Fiennes F. Murray Abraham Jude Law and Tony Revolori. Directed by Wes Anderson. (R. 99 minutes.) ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the movie that Wes Anderson has been hinting at and promising for 15 years. It has wit and yet doesnt short-circuit emotion style thats more than a gesture or attitude and good scenes that dont only stand alone but that build and become part of a substantial whole. It is every bit what people think of when they think of a Wes Anderson movie only this time the gap between the talent and the achievement is gone. Its set primarily in the early 1930s in a fictional central European city with shades of Budapest Prague and Vienna - but not the real Budapest Prague and Vienna but rather those cities as imagined and dreamed across a distance of time and space. The hotel of the title is like a hotel in a Greta Garbo movie except rendered in candy colors harking back to a time when people really believed that splendor and refinement were states of the soul not mere acts of display. At the center of all this color and bustle is Monsieur Gustave played by Ralph Fiennes in a case of timely casting thats not just inspired but insightful. For years Fiennes in his interviews has been funny open and engaging while on screen hes been often closed-off and forbidding. More in Movies Generation War review German WWII film causes some unease Need for Speed review Too long but certainly not slow Veronica Mars review Ex-teen detective helps an old flame His hard shell image has begun to crack in recent years with his exaggerated self-parody in Martin McDonaghs ""In Bruges"" and his unguarded performance in ""The Invisible Woman"" which he directed himself. But M. Gustave is the first role to show Fiennes in his full range with his mix of severity and anarchy sincerity and absurdity. As the manager M. Gustave runs the hotel with precision supervising the flower arrangements and inspecting the uniforms of the staff. At the same time he carries on sexual relationships with a succession of extremely old and rich ladies - one is played by an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton - and peppers his language with four-letter words that actually raise a laugh here. Theyre funny because from this character in this world theyre unexpected. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" written by Anderson was inspired by the work of Stefan Zweig an Austrian novelist and biographer who wrote about old Europe and later committed suicide in Brazil in exile from his country during World War II. That feeling of something beautiful that has been lost is present here not hammered home not sentimentalized but as a running undertone. This sense is built into the screenplays design which is told in layers of recollection A writer (Tom Wilkinson) of the present day remembers an incident years before when as a younger man (Jude Law) he met the Grand Budapests owner. The owner (F. Murray Abraham) in turn relates the story of his own youth as the lobby boy working under M. Gustave. The set design emphasizes this somber undercurrent. The Grand Budapest of 1932 is a dream of color but in later years its shabby around the edges - not falling down but diminished. It has the aura of threadbare opulence one finds in a lot of formerly communist cities especially Budapest the suggestion of some majestic distant past and some awful more recent past. Its like some beautiful soul beaten up and only now coming out of shock. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is full of celebrity cameos most of them welcome and as the film goes on the zaniness escalates with lots of chases and a prison break. This is where Andersons movies usually derail into silliness or smirky cleverness but not this time. The movies sad undertone saves ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" from its own zaniness - or better yet elevates the zaniness making it feel like an assertion of some right to be silly or some fundamental human expression. But also theres Fiennes and Andersons investment in Fiennes. Gustave a complicated character carries with him the movies spirit. Hes a scoundrel but he believes in something - call it beauty or the right way of doing things. Hes a comic character and yet you end up seeing him as some kind of great man perhaps a kind that cant exist anymore. That perception of Fiennes and Gustave is central to the whole enterprise. Without it the movie just breaks off and flies away. But with it ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" becomes something wonderful. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

By Ann Hornaday March 13 2014 Follow AnnHornaday ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" by Wes Anderson is a compulsively arranged sacher torte of a movie an elegant mousetrap of stories-within-stories that invokes history with a temperament ranging from winsome to deeply mournful. As a carefully constructed miniaturized universe ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is that most Andersonian of endeavors evincing the deadpan drolleries screwball action and dollhouse aesthetic that have alternately charmed and chagrined filmgoers for the past couple of decades. Set in a castlelike hotel in the fictional Mitteleuropean country of Zubrowka on the eve of World War II ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" revolves -- like all of Andersons films -- around a quirky middle-aged man and the precocious boy he takes under his wing. As such the film fully engages one of the fascinating tensions that have always animated Andersons fussily decorated cinematic jewel boxes namely how one learns to become a man within a universe of characters so stylized and artfully concocted that they seem barely human. The great good fortune of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is that the tutor in question is played by Ralph Fiennes who lends a lambent sincerity to a character who can be charming and rather loathsome at the turn of a schilling. Monsieur Gustave H. concierge at the Budapest is a smooth sinuously manipulative epitome of his craft especially when it comes to his elderly female guests -- who provide ample opportunity for Gustave to hone his gift for seduction and flattery. Those gifts are on view even when the recipient is dead as we see when Gustave and a young lobby boy named Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) embark on a fateful trip to honor a guests memory and wind up embroiled in a zany murder mystery that will take them from a spooky taxidermy-filled mansion to a cartoonish prison break to a vertiginous ski-and-sled chase from a mountaintop monastery. More than 50000 Legos used to create replica of Wes Andersons ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."" The masterpiece weighs approximately 150 pounds and stands 7 feet tall and 6.5 feet wide. (Reuters) Enlivened by such antic set pieces ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" finds Anderson at his most spirited and stylish The story told as a series of flashbacks actually spans three distinct eras each defined by its own color palette and aspect ratio (the 1930s sequences are set within the boxy storybook-like frame of the time). Draped in extravagant shades of amber rose and amethyst as lovingly crafted and iced as the airy delicacies that Gustave eagerly devours from pink boxes tied with blue ribbons ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" bears Andersons now-unmistakable signature of bespoke unapologetic devotion to craftily ordered prettiness. The film also features cameos from Andersons informal rep company including Bill Murray Bob Balaban Owen Wilson and an almost unrecognizable Tilda Swinton as well as newcomers to the club F. Murray Abraham Jude Law and Saoirse Ronan among several others. They make for a gifted gaggle of players each blessed with a great face and Anderson choreographs them with the assured hand of a pro. But its Fiennes who provides the ballast -- the gravitas and ambiguous soul -- of an endeavor that otherwise makes a genteel picturesque burlesque of Nazi-era anxieties. (According to an epigraph ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig an Austrian author who fled the country when Hitler came to power and later took his own life.) Fiennes brings a magnificent sense of detail but also withholding to Gustave who remains a cryptic figure -- sexually omni-oriented civilized refined but also prone to vulgarities and casual cruelties (especially regarding women he regularly beds). In fact ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is shot through with startling images of violence from a character off-handedly discarding a dead pet in a trash can to the sight of someones recently disembodied fingers. Theres also a brief glimpse of carnality that feels as shockingly out of place in a Wes Anderson film as a stop-motion fox might be in something by Michael Bay. For all of his commitment to the finer things in life Anderson is willing if not eager to indulge a fancy for the crude and grotesque a juxtaposition that comes into even more curious play when he treats characters physical blemishes and deformities as mere elements visual one-liners. Are the shoeshine boy with the prosthetic leg and the bakery girl with ""a port wine stain the shape of Mexico"" on her face supposed to convey Andersons humanism or a more arch and sneakily contemptuous fetishistic tendency? Even though melancholy threads through ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" its not a particularly deep film. Comparisons have been made to the wartime comedies of Ernst Lubitsch but Anderson hasnt created a playfully stinging satire as much as its softer mirror image. He convincingly mimics the gestures of the genre -- abhorrence of authoritarianism not as a crime against humanity but as an affront to good taste and Old World etiquette -- but ultimately seems unable or unwilling to delve under the sumptuous surface and grapple with darker realities. Still ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is as enchanting well-appointed and smoothly run as its titular establishment and Gustave earns the right to be called a genuinely tragic figure. If Anderson buries relatively little moral substance under lavish dollops of rich cream at least he like his fascinating protagonist sustains the illusion with a marvelous grace.    R.

March 13 2014 -- 117pm Video (0317)  ""Veronica Mars"" stays true to the spirit and spunk of the original series. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Im not sure what the formal definition of a masterpiece is but ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" strikes me as something very close. Wes Anderson who wrote and directed those modern classics ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" now gives us ""Downton Abbey"" on laughing gas. Sophisticated silly and wildly incident-packed it creates a mad rumpus at center stage while hinting at tragedies waiting in the wings. There are fantastically elaborate comic set-pieces obsessively detailed puppet-theater art direction and brilliantly crafted action sequences. This rare fusion of technical rigor and madcap wit seals Andersons claim on the title of Americas finest comic filmmaker. He nimbly evokes a once-upon-a-time Europe of beaux-arts architecture comic-opera armies and filigreed pastries. He populates this dream world with a sharply drawn regiment of lunatic aristocrats plucky commoners and blackguards. The production design is eccentric and inspired. The clashing tones of the hotels scarlet walls and the staffs royal-purple livery is a visual joke with a color punch line. As before Anderson frames his players fastidiously like gems in an elegant display case. First among them is Monsieur Gustave peerless concierge of the Grand Budapest a gigantic wedding cake of a resort in fictional alpine Zubrowka. Posture erect to the point of distortion chin a quarter-inch higher than anyone elses this well-turned-out narcissistic overtalkative fellow is a cross between Jeeves and Pepe Le Pew. He not only serves the guests but he also services the richest blondest and oldest dowagers. Through such acts of chivalry and panache he offers ""a glimmer of civilization in the barbaric slaughterhouse we know as humanity."" Ralph Fiennes plays M. Gustave with leaping eyebrows tart line readings and a fey nonchalance about Austro-Hungarian sexual repression. Fiennes is 51 now a specialist in melancholy aloof romantics and villains. But here this comedic late bloomer is a mercurial miracle. Fox Searchlight Ralph Fiennes as Gustave H. Saoirse Ronan as Agatha and Tony Revolori as Zero. The discursive plot resembles a Russian nesting doll with four timelines spanning most of a century. As we step back from the present day to the 1930s the frame shrinks from widescreen to the anachronistic boxy ratio of prewar studio films. Knockabout comedy plays well in that squarish visual scheme and what a farce this is. One of M. Gustaves most satisfied customers Madame D. (Tilda Swinton convincingly done up as an ancient grande dame) expires under mysterious circumstances leaving him a priceless medieval portrait. As the poker-faced executor of Madames will Jeff Goldblum spouts arias of gibberish legalese in a tone so blandly astringent its almost musical. Madames glowering son (Adrien Brody all splutters rages and tantrums) and his sinister henchman (Willem Dafoe with a werewolf underbite) set out to retrieve the painting by any means necessary. There are breakneck chases and imprisonment hairsbreadth escapes and giddy spectacular cliffhangers. At M. Gustaves side for most of the film is his protege lobby boy Zero Moustafa (performed with bright sparrow-like innocence by 17-year-old first timer Tony Revolori). Soaking up his mentors words of wisdom and repaying them with acts of boys adventure derring-do hes the resourceful sidekick who frequently saves the day. He also gets the girl a brave pastry chef played with winning pluck by Saoirse Ronan. There are significant actors in almost every role Bill Murray Edward Norton Harvey Keitel F. Murray Abraham Jude Law and Tom Wilkinson for starters. As various narrators dip in and out of the story were left to wonder how much of it if any is true. Throughout the movie Anderson highlights the fakery involved in his elaborate fantasy. The carriage railway that serves the mountaintop hotel is an unabashed paper cutout. The mountain backdrops are blatant matte paintings. Alexandre Desplats score is a cockeyed medley of alpenhorns balalaikas bells cymbalum triangles whistles and yodeling. If there is a naturalistic moment in this madhouse I missed it. Its sheer screwball delight from one of the most original and brilliantly funny filmmakers ever to work in Hollywood.

"Grand Budapest Hotel The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; grand-budapest-hotel-the ) Grand Budapest Hotel The (United Kingdom/Germany 2014) March 12 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli From The Royal Tenenbaums to Fantastic Mr. Fox Wes Andersons movies have always been quirky with exaggerated characters and surreal settings. The Grand Budapest Hotel is instantly recognizable as the directors output - it possesses all the qualities that make Anderson beloved by his admirers and disliked by those who find his films pretentious and inaccessible. Compared to his earlier work The Grand Budapest Hotel is a middle-of-the-road effort. Its not as endearing as Moonrise Kingdom but not as tedious as The Darjeeling Limited. It offers an engaging 90+ minutes of unconventional comedy-tinged adventure that references numerous classic movies while developing a style and narrative approach all its own. The Grand Budapest Hotels structure resembles a nesting doll. The opening scene features a young woman approaching a statue in a cemetery. She begins to read from a book written by the man whose image is before her. Cut to the 1980s where that man an unnamed author (Tom Wilkinson) discusses his craft. He talks about how one of his stories relates to a past experience. Flash back another 20 years to the lobby of The Grand Budapest Hotel a once storied venue in the fictional European Republic of Zubrowka that has fallen into disrepair. There a younger incarnation of the author (now played by Jude Law) encounters the hotel owner Mr. Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) and over dinner another tale unfolds - one that transpires during the 1930s when Mustafa was just a lad. That account buried four layers deep is the primary subject matter of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Everything else is window dressing. In the 1930s with a fascist government on the rise and war looming on the horizon The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of Europes premiere resorts due in no small part to the efforts of the superlative concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his apprentice Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori). Things change when a frequent guest dies and leaves a valued painting to Gustave. The womans heirs led by her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) seek to retain the painting by any means possible. Gustave ends up falsely imprisoned for murder in a military stockade. Meanwhile Dmitri aided by his psychopath associate Jopling (Willem Dafoe) searches for a copy of a second will that if discovered would be disadvantageous to his inheritance aspirations. Joplings preferred method of handling this investigation involves murder - something hes quite good at. Gustave as played by the impeccable Ralph Fiennes is a caricature of the always-proper gentleman. He is immaculately groomed and cares more about appearance and decorum than anything else. Hes never unctuous and manages to be strangely endearing. Some of the films most amusing moments occur when Gustave slips out of character with a burst of anger or profanity. He is at the heart of The Grand Budapest Hotel - everyone else is in orbit around him. The films longest stretch transpires within the walls of the stockade where Gustave is imprisoned. This segment has been influenced by and serves as an homage to classics like The Great Escape and Stalag 17. Later a lengthy downhill chase pokes fun at the propensity in modern cinema to embrace increasingly elaborate computer-enhanced action sequences. The punch line which I wont reveal here is laugh-aloud funny. As is his m.o. Andersons shots are carefully composed. He uses multiple aspect ratios (depending on the time frame in question) and one scene is in black-and-white. Anderson packs the cast with familiar faces in cameo roles Mathieu Amalric Harvey Keitel Bill Murray Jason Schwartzman Tilda Swinton Tom Wilkinson Owen Wilson and Bob Balaban. Many of those actors have previously worked with the director. Of those with more substantive roles Adrien Brody Willem Dafoe and Edward Norton have a shared history with him. This is Fiennes first journey with the director and it represents a rare comedy for an actor who is drawn to darker more serious material. The unpredictability of The Grand Budapest Hotels narrative allows it to progress at a fast clip. Infused with Andersons idiosyncratic humor as delivered by a squadron of accomplished actors the movie provides compelling reasons to seek it out. This wont convert those who find the director too abstruse but it represents a pleasant diversion for those who are weary of cookie-cutter motion pictures.

"Review Grand Budapest Hotel one of Andersons best - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Grand Budapest Hotel one of Andersons bestBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 03/11/2014 093538 AM PDTUpdated 03/12/2014 044443 PM PDT In one of the many scenes of eye candy from Wes Andersons enchanting ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" an apprentice baker played by Saoirse Ronan carefully boxes up a colorful confection that looks so sinfully delicious you want to reach into the screen and gobble it up. That tempting dessert could serve as a metaphor for Andersons stylized sense of moviemaking. In his eight feature-length films he has consistently whipped up a Parisian patisserie of visual treats. While all have been attractively packaged composed of choice ingredients and executed with a Michelin-starred craftsmanship not all have been winners. His 2007 ""The Darjeeling Limited"" simply went off the rails so to speak.""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a bit different a darker tweaking of a winning formula that has made Anderson into one of our most captivating storytellers. ""Budapest"" has more bite than some of his other productions especially the breezy innocent and much-loved ""Moonrise Kingdom."" Its by no means a downer but there are shadows clinging to its storied screwballesque narrative.The film centers on the adventures of a dandy of a concierge (Ralph Fiennes) and his loyal lobby boy protege (Tony Revolori) as they get drawn into a thickening plot that leads to an art theft a prison break even a villain with fangs. Anderson wrote the screenplay and has said ""Budapest"" which is set mostly in a regal striking hotel in the fictional region of Zubrowak celebrates the works of Viennese writer Stefan Zweig along with filmmaker Jacques Becker among others.Advertisement No clue as to who they are? No worries. Youre still in for a royal treat as Anderson puts his imprint on the frenetic goings-on. All the Anderson trademarks are rolled out the surreal sets the whimsical bursts of animation and the sumptuous production design. The story shifts time sequence as it latches onto the importance of art and literature juxtaposed against the cancer of fascism. Anderson once again adopts a storybook approach by dividing the narrative into chapters. We arrive near the storys end as a writer-blocked character (Jude Law) makes the acquaintance of the former lobby boy Zero Moustafa (now played by F. Murray Abraham). Zero and the unnamed writer dine in the barren beaten-down hotel a place to which history has not been kind. Zero relates an incredible tale whisking us back to a happier time when the hotel was thriving and concierge Gustav H. (Fiennes) was keeping older lonely clientele cozy. When one of his dalliances the 84-year-old Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) -- Madame D for short -- winds up dead upheaval begins and soon Gustav becomes a murder suspect while relatives including Dmitri (Adrien Brody) along with his fanged henchman (Willem Dafoe) try to stop a second will from surfacing. The lunacy leads to some shocking jolts of gory violence along with the entrances and exits of intriguing secondary characters Jeff Goldblum as an attorney with an affection for his cat; the young baker Agatha (Ronan) who is the love interest of Zero; and numerous small well-placed cameos that include Bill Murray Jason Schwartzman and other Anderson regulars.Everyone is a delight but it is Fiennes as the proud hotel showman who gives the storied performance. The Oscar-nominated Fiennes so good as Charles Dickens in ""The Invisible Woman"" has sometimes been a difficult actor to warm up to on screen. But that emotional distance works in his favor as Gustav a fascinating and erudite man who seems shallow but eventually reveals pools of depth and compassion. Fiennes refined performance keeps the film from becoming too sweet. But it is Andersons filmmaking that upstages nearly everyone and everything else except the production design. With ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" the beloved filmmaker has made one of his sharpest and tartest films yet a sobering message movie that still knows how to tickle us with a goofy ski chase that is joyously and purely Wes Anderson through and through.The Grand Budapest Hotel    1/2Rating R (for language some sexual content and violence)Cast Ralph Fiennes Tony Revolori F.

Fox Searchlight Pictures View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Wes Andersons new movie ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a higgledy-piggledy tutti-frutti concoction that also has its share of old-world melancholy. (It recently won top prize at the Berlin International Film Festival.) Set between 20th-century world wars in a series of flashbacks within flashbacks in the imaginary republic of Zubrowka its centerpiece is the eponymous hotel and its renowned concierge Monsieur Gustave (a superbly brittle and dandyish Ralph Fiennes). Gustaves protege the ""lobby boy"" Zero Moustafa (played as a young man by Tony Revolori and as an adult by F. Murray Abraham) is as much an enigma as Gustave.The universe Anderson puts before us spanning the hotels glory days and its subsequent cryptlike dilapidation is peopled mostly with actors from his stock company Bill Murray Adrien Brody Edward Norton Jason Schwartzman and many others. His color palette is startlingly otherworldly as are his trademark cinematic flourishes the frantic tracking shots the stop-motion chase scenes filmed with miniatures and dolls. Anderson makes hermetically sealed fantasias. Whats surprising here is that for all its enforced artifice the film exudes a sadness that doesnt disperse when the lights go up. His dollhouse is wetted with tears. Grade B+ (Rated R for language some sexual content and violence.)

Wes Anderson is -- at least judging by his films. He misses hand-made objects. Noblesse oblige. Plush travel. Extended families living in big sprawling houses. Quiet decency too and modest bravery -- as well as the occasional extravagant futile gesture. You can see most of that in his new delightful ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" a rich Viennese pastry of a film which is a salute to a world gone by -- not only old pre-war Europe but old pre-code Hollywood. Because there is a great sad fondness here not just for the silly royals and luxe style of a teasingly decadent Continent but also for the Coward plays and Lubitsch films that gently mocked them. Anderson is an epic miniaturist someone who arranges scenes in tiny boxes but then piles those frames one on top of the other (his favorite camera movement is a tracking shot past a row of train compartments or a line of rooms or ships cabins). In ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" though those boxes are the narrative themselves -- as we hear an old writer read a memoir of himself as a young writer listening to the story of an old man remembering his own tumultuous life as a young man. The time-honored device of the ""unreliable narrator""? This story has several. What is also has though both separating and binding all its layers - like the creme in a Napoleon pastry -- is a bittersweet fondness for a magical world gone by not just in Europe but Hollywood as well in the days before not just computers but censors. So while Anderson delights in creating a fictional (but very real) mittel-Europe he also does it with the craft of old Hollywood using carefully made miniatures and handpainted backdrops. And creating a hero who would start getting blue-pencilled out of scripts by the mid-`30s. His Monsieur Gustave -- played with great and uncharacteristic lightness by Ralph Fiennes - is both a horrible social snob and a true sexual democrat finding pleasure in everyone (although elderly women are a particular specialty). Is he a gigolo? Is he gay? Oh darling that is so besides the point. Lets just call him a gourmand. N.J.

Fiennes is delightfully wry -- hes like a sexually ambidextrous David Niven -- and hes ably supported by Wes Anderson Stock Company including (in small parts) Bill Murray Bob Balaban Edward Norton and made up as an ancient dowager Tilda Swinton. (Tom Wilkinson Jude Law and F. Murray Abraham meanwhile fill in as narrators.) Fiennes -- who long has had a tendency toward the self-tortured -- is marvelous as the fussy hotelier whose absurd affectations (hes particularly fond of one cologne ""Lair de Panache"") only disguise a very real core of honor. And it is one he is going to have to rely on as he and his young bellboy protege find themselves living in a darkening world of murdered aristocrats marching fascists and assorted prisoners assassins and murderers. Scored to mostly classical music crammed full of real European detail the movie is a very carefully wrought work of art - and like all of Andersons work sometimes that exactitude can feel a little chilly a bit overly precise. You may find yourself yearning for a little less formalism a bit more rough and raw emotion. And yet in the end ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" does deliver a strong feeling and its the same one all of Andersons best movies do. And its not anger or lust or even simple giddy joy. Its a far subtler perhaps wiser mood that that. And its simple wistful regret -- for a youth now gone and a world gone by. Ratings note The film contains some strong language and violence. The Grand Budapest Hotel (R) Fox Searchlight (99 min.) Directed by Wes Anderson. With Ralph Fiennes F. Murray Abraham.

Theres an element of truth to that criticism and indeed that tendency reaches its apotheosis in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" an elaborate and delightful work of tragicomic confectionery set at an imaginary resort in an imaginary country (partly constructed with miniatures) that depicts the interwar years in Europe largely as a set of high-society high jinks out of 1930s Hollywood comedies. Andersons cast features one of Ralph Fiennes best performances and is loaded with peculiar delights including cameos by Bill Murray and Owen Wilson. His script is loaded with zingers and divided into chapters with on-screen titles while the camerawork -- by Robert Yeoman shooting on 35mm film of course -- whips around the set like Bugs Bunny outrunning Elmer Fudd. This is one of Andersons funniest and most fanciful movies but perversely enough it may also be his most serious most tragic and most shadowed by history with the frothy Ernst Lubitsch-style comedy shot through with an overwhelming sense of loss.I can fully understand that Andersons overdecorated overstylized and highly self-conscious movies arent for everyone but at least some of the criticism rests on a faulty philosophical or aesthetic footing. Do movies made in a more naturalistic mode like mainstream comedies and dramas with their formulaic three-act plots actually do a better job of reproducing human relationships or social reality? What about movies set in outrageously artificial universes like action films or thrillers where we simply agree to overlook the fact that everything that happens is wildly implausible? To move the question to a larger frame since when are the movies supposed to create a convincing simulacrum of reality? American cinema which remains the mediums dominant model hardly ever does and hardly ever has.What irritates some people about Andersons films I suspect is the fact that their artificiality is right there on the surface. He resists both the convention of verisimilitude -- where we accept certain kinds of ludicrous stories and settings as ""realistic"" because of the clothes and the cars and the dialogue -- and the convention of psychological realism in which characters will be revealed and explained will change and grow over the course of the three-act narrative. This leads in turn to the mistaken conclusion that theres something childish or trivial about Andersons movies that they consist entirely of wistful privileged navel-gazing and never engage serious moral or emotional themes. That was never entirely fair and its become more obviously untrue in his recent films. If the equally wonderful ""Moonrise Kingdom"" was a movie about the loneliness of adult emotional life wearing the skin of a teen romance ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a light comedy about the destruction of Old Europe and the perplexing nature of cultural memory.M. Gustave the rakish and demanding concierge played by Ralph Fiennes in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is never revealed to us in that change-and-grow emotional-journey sense. (He goes on a journey all right but a stolen Renaissance painting and a bobsled borrowed from an Alpine monastery are involved.) Like nearly all Anderson characters M. Gustave is inextricable from his setting; in a sense its not clear where one ends and the other begins. We never learn anything about his childhood his parentage or his education outside the magnificent eponymous establishment a school of hard knocks furnished in velvet satin and exquisite little chocolate bonbons. If Gustaves accent suggests a working-class Englishman who has clawed his way to relative privilege his vocabulary suggests a Yank striver putting on airs. We dont know and it doesnt matter; his corruption pretension vanity and nobility are those of the hotel itself. Late in the movie someone who knew him well observes that M. Gustave belonged to an era that had already ended before he came along - and that was only one of the occasions when I wondered about parallels between M. Gustave and Wes Anderson.Perhaps M. Gustave is the protagonist of ""The Great Budapest Hotel"" but even that is not clear. Certainly he is the films charismatic centerpiece but Andersons screenplay (from a story he conceived with Hugo Guinness) spins M. Gustaves tale as the third of three nested narratives a story within a story within a story. Anderson has specifically cited the influence of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig who committed suicide during World War II but at certain moments I couldnt help thinking of Vladimir Nabokov another European exile with a half-jaundiced half-nostalgic view of the Old World. In the first layer set in the mid-80s a writer in late middle age (Tom Wilkinson) tells us about his visit to the Grand Budapest in 1968 when the once-glorious resort had fallen into Communist-era decrepitude complete with hideous orange carpeting and fluorescent strip lighting. In that story the writer as a younger man (Jude Law) becomes fascinated by an enigmatic older gentleman named Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who sits alone in the lobby but is treated with great deference by the hotels bored and desultory staff. (Anderson found his hotel -- actually a former department store -- and most of the films other exteriors in Gorlitz an unusually well preserved town in eastern Germany.) You Might Also Like Moustafa it turns out is the hotels owner or at least he was before the Grand Budapest and everything else in the fictional nation of Zubrowka became the property of the state. It is he in the course of a long dinner conversation with Laws character who tells us about his early life as a war refugee who became a ""lobby boy"" in the Grand Budapest where he fell under the spell of the entirely reprehensible but irresistible M. Gustave. Played as a boy by the wonderfully deadpan Tony Revolori the Zero Moustafa of the 1930s is a stranger in a strange land an unspecific ethnic outsider (is he Arab? Jewish? Armenian? We never know) who worships M. Gustave as an embodiment of European propriety even through revelations that the latter is a cad adventurer and hypocrite whos running a lucrative side operation as a gigolo for rich and ancient ladies. One of these ladies Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (played briefly and hilariously by Tilda Swinton) has recently departed this mortal coil leaving M. Gustave a priceless painting and setting off a farcical round of double-crosses chase scenes and murders thats about as important as the plot in most Marx Brothers films. Adrien Brody plays Madame D.s enraged son whos affiliated with a Zubrowkan political movement involving black jackboots and leather trench coats which begins to seem slightly more sinister and familiar as the story progresses. Willem Dafoe monosyllabic and terrifying is his brutal right-hand man. Goodness it would take too long to delineate all the great moments provided by this cast of Anderson regulars mixed with newcomers Edward Norton as an upright military officer Mathieu Amalric as a butler Saoirse Ronan as the Zubrowkan bakers apprentice who becomes young Zeros paramour Jeff Goldblum as a methodical attorney. Through it all moves Fiennes slinging his Anglo-gangster quips in all directions simultaneously standing for starched-shirt rectitude and unashamed debauchery.Beneath the zany colorful and exceptionally entertaining caper on its surface ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is also a tale of tragedy and doom and one thats a lot more sophisticated about politics history and nostalgia than it appears to be. Anderson has also mentioned the influence of Irene Nemirovskys best-selling World War II novel ""Suite Francaise"" and the historical chapters of Hannah Arendts ""Eichmann in Jerusalem"" and unlikely as that sounds you can feel it. On one hand while M. Gustave is a phony and a con man he isnt a murderer or a maniac like those who will overthrow his world. On the other the old order of Europe he claims to venerate (and steals from) gave birth to monsters and ended in apocalypse. The Grand Budapest got Soviet-orange carpeting and then was torn down; Zero Moustafa and the Law/Wilkinson writer and Wes Anderson and you and I are left to look back at the lost past in mingled longing and horror just able to see it but not quite to grasp it.

""[His] films are so artistically exquisite that they should be framed and mounted"" writes Us Weeklys film critic Mara Reinstein Credit Martin Scali/Fox Searchlight In theaters Friday March 7 3 stars (out of 4 stars) Director Wes Andersons films are so artistically exquisite that they should be framed and mounted. And this effort -- primarily set in a quaint European town in the fictional Republic of Zubrowskain the 1930s -- may be his most astounding. For not only has the auteur delivered another intricately constructed visual feast he adds a rich tale (one half murder-mystery one half crime caper) and a healthy dose of madcap humor. PHOTOS Oscars 2014 -- biggest after parties They dont make em like the Grand Budapest Hotel anymore. Its the kind of place that looks like a frosted castle burrowed under sparkles in a snow globe. Its also where genteel concierge Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) pampers his elderly female customers and takes pains to get to know them. This may or may not always be in the biblical sense. The long-winded backstory doesnt perk up until Gustaves favorite client dies (Tilda Swinton in remarkable old-age makeup) and leaves him with a one-of-a-kind painting called Boy With Apple. Her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) forbids him from taking it; he swipes it anyway. Then promptly ends up in prison. (Only in Andersons world could a drab jail be bolded by the sight of vividly colored square patisserie boxes delivered to Gustave.) PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Gustave escapes and tries to clear his name by way motorcycles a bobsled run () a cable car that runs in the mountains and a confession in a monastery booth. Not only is this a delightful sequence its an excuse for Anderson to employ his go-to ensemble including Bill Murray and Owen Wilson. (Jason Schwartzman also has a droll cameo). Still Fiennes is the one who leads the way with his effortless wit and comedic charm. In his final noble act he makes a heartwarming and selfless gesture toward his bright-eyed young protege Zero. Yes the sadistic Nazi from Schindlers List and Lord Voldemort himself Who knew? PHOTOS Best movies of 2012 And like all Anderson films the love is in the eccentric details -- from the decorative cake slices to all those handcrafted bright uniforms. Priceless stuff.

(Ralph Fiennes with Saoirse Ronan and Tony Revolori) is a hotel concierge in an Eastern Europe falling under Hitlers shadow -- a man pining for the Old World sensibility thats fading all around him. Bob Yeoman/Fox Searchlight Pictures hide caption toggle caption Bob Yeoman/Fox Searchlight Pictures The Grand Budapest Hotel Director Wes Anderson Genre Comedy Running time 99 minutes Rated R for language some sexual content and violence With Ralph Fiennes F. Murray Abraham Mathieu Amalric Adrien Brody Willem Dafoe Jeff Goldblum Harvey Keitel Jude Law Bill Murray Edward Norton Saoirse Ronan Jason Schwartzman Lea Seydoux Tilda Swinton(Recommended) Chances are youve already made up your mind about Wes Anderson. Either youre willing to go with the meticulous symmetry of his dollhouse compositions the precious tchotchke-filled design sensibility and the stilted formality of his dialogue or you check out of his storybook worlds in the first five minutes. On the evidence of his eighth feature The Grand Budapest Hotel its clear no one is more aware of his idiosyncracies than Anderson himself -- and hes not apologizing. Grand Budapest is a culmination of the tinkly music-box aesthetic of Andersons work to date turned up to 11. If youve already tuned out all the two dimensional tracking shots whip-pans color coordination and stop-motion animation is going to come crashing down on you like a truckload of playfully plinking harpsichords. But if you meet Anderson on his terms youll reach the end and just want more. The films structure is a justification of the distant remove from anything resembling reality with Anderson nesting the primary narrative within a series of framing stories. The primary tale is a zany caper set in the fictional Eastern European republic of Zubrowka involving murder stolen art a prison break and a mountainside toboggan chase. At the center is Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) concierge of the mountaintop resort of the title and his lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori). That plot unfolds in 1932 but its a story that in the film is related as an oral history in the 60s written as a book some years later explained by the author in 1985 and finally at the outermost level of this series of Russian nesting dolls read in the present day by a young woman in a cemetery. If the film seems removed from reality its no wonder Its being filtered through decades multiple perspectives artistic license and a heavy shroud of nostalgia. But then nostalgia has always weighed heavily on Andersons work and in Gustave hes created a character even more attached to the past than he is. As the modern world creeps into Old Europe the stately exacting concierge constantly laments the lack of dignity and decorum of the advancing 20th century. This is a fact that on the surface seems at odds with his habit of sleeping with many of the hotels elderly female guests but for Gustave this is both part of his enduring attachment to the past as well as a function of his hospitality. ""I sleep with all my friends"" he says matter-of-factly at one point. His ongoing relationship with one of those friends Madame D (a delightfully eccentric Tilda Swinton) becomes problematic when she turns up dead and her will leaves him a priceless painting. Her heirs -- a bickering bunch headed up by her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) and thug-for-hire Jopling (Willem Dafoe) -- are none too pleased and frame Gustave for the crime. Anderson is well aware that theres great humor to be found in the mismatch between Gustaves Old World gentility and his promiscuity -- not to mention his frequent bursts of profanity. Fiennes a new addition to Andersons usual stable of actors proves perfectly suited to the directors arid comic timing and the result is in terms of volume and effectiveness of jokes far and away Andersons funniest film. He expertly mines the films contrasting inclinations making violent and often shockingly bloody jokes. Like much of early-30s Europe Zubrowka is on the brink of a fascist takeover and Grand Budapest has some of the best Nazi-inspired humor since Mel Brooks ""Springtime for Hitler."" Theres so much going on here a constant stream of jokes plot contrivances film references and images overladen with gorgeous detail that it might all collapse in on itself if not for the relationship between Gustave and his young protege Zero. For those playing at home this checks another box off on the Wes Anderson bingo card -- his recurring theme of the bond between surrogate fathers and sons. More important it gives the movie a beating heart beneath layer upon layer of careful and distancing artifice. Theres much to admire on the surface of The Grand Budapest Hotel but as with all of Andersons best work what lasts are the emotional notes it hits almost invisibly. As Monsieur Gustave would surely agree the mark of an expert lobby boy is to provide what the hotels guests need without their ever knowing he was there.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 850 a.m. EST March 7 2014This stylized and vibrant caper is Wes Andersons most ambitious mesmerizing and complex tale yet.Ralph Fiennes left and Tony Revolori anchor the latest from director Wes Anderson the caper comedy The Grand Budapest Hotel.(Photo Fox Searchlight)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review    1/2 out of fourStars Ralph Fiennes Tony Revelori F. Murray Abraham Mathieu Amalric Adrien Brody Willem Dafoe Jeff Goldblum Bill Murray Jude Law Tilda SwintonRated R; Runtime 1 hour 39 minutes; Opens Friday in select citiesDirector Wes Anderson is the uncontested master of films that artfully blend whimsy and emotion.Sometimes his efforts advance promisingly and then veer into twee territory (The Royal Tenenbaums); other movies are just too weird to appeal to mass audiences (The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou). More recently they hit the loveliest notes of inventive wonder and storybook imagery (Moonrise Kingdom).The Grand Budapest Hotel (   1/2 out of four; rated R; opening Friday in select cities) falls happily into the last category. Its a mature intricately layered visual delight.Andersons eighth film is centered on an opulent pastel-pink palatial hotel in a spa town in the fictional Eastern European republic of Zubrowka in the early 1930s. The tale begins in 1985 told by an unidentified author (Tom Wilkinson) in flashbacks. The authors younger self (Jude Law) goes to the hotel in the late 1960s and becomes spellbound by a complicated story spun over dinner by the hotels reclusive proprietor Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). Moustafa inherited the once-magnificent establishment from Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) the former concierge. The young Moustafa (Tony Revolori) was a shy lobby boy as well as Gustaves protege and confidant back in the 1930s.STORY Grand Budapest Hotel completely explainedREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersFiennes is brilliant as the haughty refined and sexually ambiguous Gustave. A fascinating scoundrel whos also fiercely loyal and ridiculously witty Gustave wears a purple tuxedo and is perhaps Andersons most memorable character since Rushmores Max Fischer.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The Grand Budapest Hotel feels like an independent film but features a blockbuster cast including Ralph Fiennes Bill Murray Edward Norton Willem Dafoe Adrian Brody Jude Law Owen Wilson and many more stars. VPCThe meticulous lucid and ambitious caper covers the directors signature theme of family dysfunction as seen through his distinctive perspective and within the rigorous framing of an illustrated storybook style and Old-World production design.The author begins by recalling the memories of Moustafa as seen through his own youthful remembrances. It becomes increasingly clear that this is not only a crime thriller but a multilayered story about abiding friendship.The character that has our complete attention is the courtly Gustave. With a penchant for elderly rich widows (preferably ""insecure vain and superficial"") his bon vivant ways are leavened with sleaze. He cannot go anywhere without dousing himself in a cologne called LAir de Panache. His manners however are impeccable. He communicates in flowing baroque prose a one-man crusade against imprecise discourse.In his dalliances with dowagers Gustave is particularly partial to Madame Desgoffe aka Madame D (Tilda Swinton) an octogenarian whose desires are quenched forever when she suddenly mysteriously dies. She bequeaths a priceless painting to Gustave inciting the ire of greedy Dmitri (Adrien Brody) the villainous scion of her batty aristocratic family. The Renaissance-era painting is at the center of this farcical saga which occasionally resembles the Pink Panther movies with its chases narrow escapes and disguises. The arty thriller features a cast of such Anderson regulars as Jason Schwartzman Owen Wilson Bill Murray and Ed Norton.Though arch and occasionally mannered Grand Budapest Hotel is droll enchanting and thoughtful. Anderson creates his own detailed quirky fantasy world which is an undeniable treat to visit. Its an antiquated universe that thoroughly captivates. But as the dark cloud of fascism looms over this stunning 1930s landscape a sense of melancholy seeps into the narrative. Thirty years later the hotel is grimly ravaged having been taken over by a Communist regime.Theres more to The Grand Budapest Hotel than its dazzling candy-colored exterior. A sense of political inevitability and a yearning for a more innocent time infuses it.A haunting and humane tale peopled with unforgettable characters its the work of a highly original filmmaker at the top of his game. 167 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1ieLNqn",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/03/06/grand-budapest-hotel-review/5807779/,200,thegrandbudapesthotel31,thegrandbudapesthotel,usatoday
"Wes Anderson makes The Grand Budapest Hotel a four-star delight - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Wes Anderson makes The Grand Budapest Hotel a four-star delight The Grand Budapest Hotel Movie review by Kenneth Turan. Kenneth Turan reviews The Grand Budapest Hotel. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews The Grand Budapest Hotel. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Wes Anderson sweats the details. All of them all the time to an extent that can be maddening. But not in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" where the writer-directors familiar style blends with a group of unexpected factors to create a magnificently cockeyed entertainment.With credits including ""Moonrise Kingdom"" ""The Darjeeling Limited"" and the stop-motion animation ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Anderson works so assiduously to create obsessively detailed on-screen worlds that the effect has sometimes been hermetic even stifling. ""The Grand Budapest"" however is anything but. Delighting in all manner of old movie tropes from elaborate chases to hairs-breadth escapes to Victorian plot devices like ""the second copy of the second will"" this playful yet poignant film anchored by a knockout performance by Ralph Fiennes tells the Boys Own Adventure yarn of how a celebrated hotel concierge and a lowly lobby boy team up to have the adventure of a lifetime.Oscars 2015 Full coverage Its not that Anderson working with his usual team including cinematographer Robert Yeoman production designer Adam Stockhausen and costume designer Milena Canonero has let up on the specifics here. Quite the contrary. Wes Andersons The Grand Budapest Hotel follows a mustachioed concierge who enlists a young employee to help him prove his innocence after being wrongly framed for a hotel murder. (By Andrea Wang) Even the smallest concrete yet imaginary element of ""Grand Budapests"" main setting -- the celebrated spa hotel in the fictional European republic of Zubrowka -- was fanatically created by Anderson and company down to its newspaper of record the Trans-Alpine Yodel and its pastry of choice the mouthwatering Courtesan au chocolat always packaged in the unmistakable pink boxes from Mendls Patisserie.Initially setting this fiercely eccentric world -- Andersons own Magic Kingdom if you will apart from the directors previous universes -- are aspects that combine to give it unexpected substance and more than a trace of sorrow.

The eight films contending for the Academy Award for best picture were unveiled Thursday giving moviegoers five weeks to catch up before the Oscars on Feb. 22. Heres a rundown of where -- and in a few cases how -- you can see them. ""American Sniper"" Clint Eastwoods biographical drama starring... (Oliver Gettell) For one thing ""Grand Budapest"" is set in the past not the present day and moreover in a past that the film understands is overshadowed by darkness. Its a Central European world thats doomed to be destroyed twice over first by storm trooper fascism and then by communism and many of its people are not fated to survive the transitions. Also elevating ""Grand Budapest"" is the transformative work of Fiennes as the films protagonist Gustave H the concierges concierge. Anderson has worked with fine actors before but hes frankly never had someone so capable of giving his will-o-the-wisp world heft and reality while still being faithful to the singular spirit that underlies it.GRAPHIC Wes Andersons recurring castFiennes last seen as the ebullient Charles Dickens in ""The Invisible Woman"" throws himself into the Gustave H role with unbounded but carefully calibrated zeal. Imperious subservient and resplendent in an outlandish purple morning coat he is the Grand Budapests irreplaceable man simultaneously in total charge and at your service.Because of the way hes written by Anderson (who shares story credit with Hugo Guinness) and played by Fiennes Gustave H is also a man of convincing feelings. That means his relationship with earnest lobby boy Zero Moustafa (a fine Tony Revolori) which starts as a master-protege bond and becomes a real friendship has an emotional genuineness that is rare in Andersons films.Before we meet Zero or even Gustave H the ever-indirect Anderson leads us in classic oddball fashion through a series of flashbacks that cover and protect the main story like a group of Russian nesting dolls.We start briefly in the present day in a cemetery in Zubrowkas capital city of Lutz with a tribute being paid to the countrys most celebrated writer the beloved author of a novel called ""The Grand Budapest Hotel.""Then we go back to 1985 and listen as that author (Tom Wilkinson) gives a radio talk about how he came to write the book. Then we go back yet again to 1968 with the still-unnamed author (now played by Jude Law) taking his ease in the Sovietized Grand Budapest an almost-derelict hotel with a palpable air of sadness about it.It is here that the author meets the adult Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) now the richest man in Zubrowka and the owner of the Grand Budapest. How the author wonders did he come to buy it? Over an elaborate dinner the film flashes back to 1932 and settles down to tell its main tale.Gustave H it turns out is not only the concierge of the Grand Budapest but also the main reason many visitors come in the first place. This is especially true of a group of elderly female guests of substantial income who rely on this most accommodating of men for the romantic/sexual services he is always willing to provide.First among equals is the fabulously wealthy 84-year-old dowager countess Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis familiarly known as Madame D. (Yes thats Tilda Swinton under five hours of daily makeup and a Bride of Frankenstein wig).The most unimportant person at the Grand Budapest is Zero provisionally hired as a junior lobby boy in training. Belying his name Zero sees everything and becomes the last living witness to an era where service and politeness were everything and rudeness was considered to be no more than ""the expression of fear.""When Madame D unexpectedly dies ""Grand Budapests"" plot kicks into high gear involving Gustave and Zero in all manner of convoluted nonsense thats taken completely seriously. That includes everything from a priceless purloined painting to a prison break (Anderson confesses to be a fan of Jacques Beckers classic ""Le Trou"") to the Society of the Crossed Keys a super-secret concierge collective whose members are played by the likes of Bill Murray Bob Balaban and Fisher Stevens.PHOTOS Deconstructing Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom Though visuals are Andersons sine qua non having actors who are on his wavelength has always been critical for him and ""Grand Budapest"" is brought to life by a wide variety of performers often in small roles. Starting with Saoirse Ronan as Agatha an apprentice at Mendls the list includes Edward Norton Adrien Brody Willem Dafoe Jeff Goldblum Mathieu Amalric Harvey Keitel Jason Schwartzman Lea Seydoux and Anderson mainstay Owen Wilson as an unlikely concierge called M. Chuck.Though the Grand Budapest building looks as if it couldnt be more real its facade is an elaborate miniature and the establishment itself was constructed in an abandoned department store in the restored town of Gorlitz on the German-Polish border. Similarly though Andersons style couldnt be more his own he acknowledges the inspiration of Austrian writer Stefan Zweig. ""Grand Budapest"" also owes a debt to the movie world of faux European aristocracy on display in films like ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" and such Ernst Lubitsch gems as ""The Merry Widow"" and ""The Smiling Lieutenant.""The sensibility of Lubitsch the charming filmmaker with a complex understanding of the human comedy seems closest to this films. When Lubitsch felt according to Peter Bogdanovich that ""the Nazis most damning sin was their bad manners"" he would have found a kindred spirit in Gustave H. ""His world had vanished before he entered it"" says Zero Moustafa and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" makes us especially sad that it is gone.kenneth.turanlatimes.com-------------------------------The Grand Budapest HotelMPAA rating R for language some sexual content and violenceRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying At Arclight Hollywood Landmark West Los Angeles Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Wes Anderson Authors The Grand Budapest Hotel Ralph Fiennes Reviews Oscars 2015 Play-at-home ballot Wes Anderson is off in a new world with Grand Budapest Hotel Wes Andersons world His recurring cast Grand Budapest Hotel cast on Wes Andersons latest dreamscape Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-grand-budapest-hotel-20140307,0,6392404.story",200,thegrandbudapesthotel32,thegrandbudapesthotel,latimes

The Grand Budapest Hotel By Peter Travers March 6 2014 More News A Taste of Moonshine From Wes Andersons New Movie All Stories >> The rap on Wes Anderson is that he doesnt make movies so much as build castles in the air. To Anderson haters from Bottle Rocket and Rushmore to Fantastic Mr. Fox and Moonrise Kingdom his films reek of pressed flowers too stale and studied to feel for. More News A Taste of Moonshine From Wes Andersons New Movie All Stories >> To the rest of us the 44-yearold Texan is one of the few original stylists working in modern cinema. The Grand Budapest Hotel the new Anderson film that opened to raves at the Berlin Film Festival wont silence his detractors. Its a filigreed toy box of a movie so delicious-looking you may want to lick the screen. It is also in the Anderson manner shot through with humor heartbreak and a bruised romantics view of the past. It is also not in the Anderson manner a rollicking caper that mixes theft murder a prison break and pastry recipes into a rousing free-forall that speeds by like a dervish. Set in a fictional European spa town between the world wars with Nazis on the march and an elegant way of life under siege The Grand Budapest Hotel pivots around the character of Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes) the hotel concierge who believes that etiquette helps define civilization. Gustaves morals are no match for his manners as he enjoys sexual congress with guests of both sexes. Its a feast of a role and Fiennes exuding Olympian verbal dexterity nails every comic and dramatic nuance. Hes sensational. Anderson cleverly surrounds Gustave with glorious liars lovers and clowns. Newcomer Tony Revolori excels as Zero Moustafa the lobby boy Gustave takes under his wing. The vain concierge flirts with Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) Zeros true love who carries a facial birthmark shaped like Mexico. Agatha works at Mendls bakery where her famed pastry Courtesan au chocolat helps thicken the plot. And boy does the plot thicken when the unforgettable Tilda Swinton covered in wrinkly latex shows up as Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis an 84-yearold dowager with a thing for Gustave. Its the murder of Madame D and a stolen Renaissance painting that puts Gustave and Zero on the run from cops led by Inspector (Edward Norton) and Dmitri (Adrien Brody) Madame Ds ruthless son and his henchman Jopling a killer played all in black by a killer-funny Willem Dafoe a Dr. Strangelove cruel enough to throw a cat out a window. As the film spins on its axis like a Marx Brothers farce a peak of hilarity is hit when Gustave and Zero escape prison with the help of a tattooed Harvey Keitel. Characters tumble out with frenzied unpredictability including Bill Murray Owen Wilson and Jason Schwartzman as a trio of wacky concierges. Abetted by Robert Yeomans luscious camerawork and a bouncy score by Alexandre Desplat the film has a careless ease thats irresistible. Anderson of course wants to create more than the movie equivalent of a pastry from Mendls. He frames his film with an older Zero (F. Murray Abraham) telling his story to a young writer (Jude Law). Anderson credits Viennese writer Stefan Zweig for inspiring the script he wrote with Hugo Guinness. And critics at Berlin couldnt refrain from comparing the film to the 1930s classics of Ernst Lubitsch. My advice is dont let academic analysis bury the pleasures of beholding Anderson in a wonderland of his own making. His abiding love for a vanished past real and imagined is at the core of The Grand Budapest Hotel. The thrill comes in watching as this rare talent gives his movie wings.

The adventures of a concierge (Ralph Fiennes) at a European hotel between the wars and the lobby boy (Tony Revolori) who becomes his most trusted friend. (Photo/Video Fox) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated March 6 2014 1023 p.m. ET Hardly a moment goes by in Wes Andersons ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" when there isnt something to make us smile--a pretty image a funny line a droll sight gag a charming set a striking juxtaposition of color or tone. ""The plot thickens"" says Monsieur Gustave the suave Eastern European concierge played by Ralph Fiennes. Then he adds ""Why by the way? Is it a soup metaphor?"" Probably but what kind of soup? Goulash? Vichyssoise? Or duck soup derived not so distantly from the Marx Brothers absurdist classic that like most of this film was set in a mythical nation of Europe between the wars? The setting here is the Republic of Zubrowka--first in the bleakness of that tiny states postwar communist rule but then through flashback in the fragile grandeur of the early 1930s when Gustave a cosmopolitan legend in his own time reigns supreme in the vast and elegant spa hotel of the title. The production has been conceived in a spirit of joyous artifice; in other words its instantly recognizable as a Wes Anderson film. (The production designer was Adam Stockhausen. Robert Yeoman was director of photography. Alexandre Desplat composed the scintillating score.) Self-puncturing balloons of witty dialogue combine with a lurid caper of a plot to tell a touching tale of unlikely buddies--the concierge and his naive young protege Zero Moustava (Tony Revolori) a sad-faced lobby boy who despite zero experience zero education and zero family turns out to be as stalwart and resourceful as Gustave himself. ENLARGE Willem Dafoe in The Grand Budapest Hotel Fox Searchlight Pictures The nature of the caper defeats description though a list of its parts begins with Tilda Swintons dowager whose death sets everything else in motion; an accusation of murder; a priceless Renaissance painting; Adrian Brodys villainous Dmitri the dowagers son; Jeff Goldblums attorney Kovacs who sports a Freudian beard; Saoirse Ronans Agatha an apprentice in Zubrowkas pre-eminent bakery; and Edward Nortons Henckels a military police chief who chases Gustave and Zero when they go on the lam for reasons that seem perfectly plausible within the surreal system of the plot. The cast also includes F. Murray Abraham Mathieu Amalric Willem Dafoe Harvey Keitel Jude Law Bill Murray Jason Schwartzman Tom Wilkinson and Owen Wilson. Happily in keeping with the absurdity no one bothers with European accents. Plain American is the dominant dialect except for Gustave; he speaks the English of the actor who plays him. Mr. Fiennes plays him brilliantly and hilariously though with flashes of anger that allude to the gathering darkness of the real-life period. Mr. Anderson has acknowledged the bittersweet stories of Stefan Zweig as one of the inspirations for his screenplay and aspects of the Austrian writer long dead and all but forgotten can be found in the character of the concierge. Cosmopolitan self-ironic and sexually ambiguous just as Zweig was Gustave is a picaresque hero but he is also a fierce survivor who speaks more than once of ""this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity."" Real life is not the movies concern. Mr. Andersons lovely confection--thats a pastry metaphor--keeps us smiling and sometimes laughing out loud. Yet acid lurks in the cakes lowest layers. Watch a clip from the film ""The Face of Love."" A widow (Annette Bening) falls for a guy (Ed Harris) who bears a striking resemblance to her late husband. Also starring Robin Williams. (Photo/Video Sundance Selects) The Face of Love The people who made this moist love story must have figured that no one remembers anything anymore or that no one knows anything anymore. A full enjoyment of ""The Face of Love"" requires having forgotten or not knowing that Alfred Hitchcock made ""Vertigo."" Also though much less crucially that Annette Bening already played a real-estate agent in ""American Beauty"" and that Ed Harris already played a painter in ""Pollock."" ""You know what they say"" a neighbor played by Robin Williams tells Ms. Benings beautiful but lonely widow Nikki. ""We all have a double somewhere in the world."" Maybe so but under the redoubling circumstances Nikkis discovery of Tom her dead husbands doppelganger--Tom teaches art and paints on the side--seems half as creepy as it might have been and at a minimum doubly dumb. ENLARGE Annette Bening in The Face of Love IFC Films Nikki isnt exactly a real-estate agent. She prepares empty houses for sale by staging them--furnishing them decorating them even filling them with the smell of baking bread. Thats an analog for what the director Arie Posin and his co-writer Matthew McDuffie have tried to do with their film--fill a bare-bones version of the Hitchcock film with an illusion of life. They do succeed sporadically. The doppelganger premise still has its appeal; whole generations of filmgoers have never seen ""Vertigo"" or for that matter Krzysztof Kieslowskis gorgeously ambiguous ""The Double Life of Veronique."" And its always a pleasure to watch Ms. Bening and Mr. Harris. Fine actors that they are they serve the script no matter how many disservices it does to them and to simple logic. But the premise is at once too much and not enough. Its too much for these filmmakers to handle. They have Nikki trying desperately to hide the truth from everyone including Tom yet shes able to do so only with the help of woefully inept plot contrivances. And its not enough to cover up a paucity of invention. When Brian De Palma recycled Hitchcock in ""Dressed to Kill"" he did it with such fervor and ingenuity that you were glad to forget about the original at least for a while. Watching ""The Face of Love"" you cant forget or forgive. Watch a clip from the documentary film ""Elaine Stritch Shoot Me"" The uncompromising Tony and Emmy Award-winner is showcased both on and off stage via rare archival footage and intimate cinema verite. (Photo/Video Sundance Selects) Elaine Stritch Shoot Me Chiemi Karasawas unblinking documentary feature watches Elaine Stritch struggle with the toughest role of her life--being old and in constantly uncertain health. Struggle is the key word here; its what makes the heroine of so many Broadway productions authentically heroic. ""You see her struggle"" says a perceptive admirer during a cabaret performance at New Yorks Carlyle Hotel ""and you see her make it through to the other side."" What you also see--and this is what makes the film such a treat--is a legendary entertainer redefining at the age of 86 the word ""irrepressible."" Thats been one of the standard descriptors attached to her ever since she hit Broadway in the 1940s; that and less flattering ones like brassy screechy obstreperous impossible or for much of her working life drunk. In the course of ""Elaine Stritch Shoot Me"" she claims to have been sober more or less for 24 years. Theres every reason to believe her for the energy on display--her life force--is prodigious except when its under siege from fluctuations in her blood sugar. ""Everybodys got a bag of rocks"" she says citing a maxim that was favored by her husband the late John Bay. Shes hauled around some heavy ones--first her alcoholism and now her diabetes which in concert with her octogenarianism occasionally clouds her memory. ENLARGE Elaine Stritch Sundance Selects A couple of terrifying memory lapses occur on camera while shes rehearsing for a tour in which shes to sing--what else?--many of the Stephen Sondheim songs for which shes famous. Her material counts as a small polished rock; most of those intricate Sondheim lyrics would challenge a singer half her age. In performance though shes still pretty prodigious and her performance in the film isnt confined to any stage. She does an impromptu duet with an elevator operator at the Carlyle where she lived in a corner apartment. She sashays down Fifth Avenue and through Central Park in heels. She directs one of the cameramen ""Dont you think youre awfully close to me Shane?"" And on stage she sings a Sondheim song that by itself is worth the price of admission. ""I Feel Pretty"" from ""West Side Story"" was written for an ingenue not a grande dame in her ninth decade but she sings it with delicious irony self-irony and irrepressible delight. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) Wes Andersons stop-action animated version of the classic childrens novel by Roald Dahl is an inspired and inspiring match. The script written by the director with Noah Baumbach takes elaborate liberties with its source material. Now the bane of three farmers existence is a bushy-tailed newspaper columnist voiced by George Clooney. (His wife voiced by Meryl Streep had been urging him to stop stealing birds and find a new line of work.) If that sounds precious or improbable the film is all of that and more the more being foxily funny. ENLARGE Pollock (2000) Ed Harris got an Oscar nomination for his performance as the American painter Jackson Pollock; he directed the film. Marcia Gay Harden won a supporting-role Oscar for playing Pollocks wife and fellow painter Lee Krasner. The productions weak link is the script by Barbara Turner and Susan J. Emshwiller. Its huge strength is the central performance. Pollock was the quintessential Action Painter so it seems fitting that Mr. Harris athleticizes the process rather than aestheticizes it. One sequence pits Pollock against every painters most terrifying adversary a blank canvas. Mr. Harris does the actual painting remarkably well. ENLARGE Being Julia (2004) Of the many gifts that Annette Bening brings to her roles the most endearing may be a sense of self-enjoyment. She seems genuinely--and justifiably--pleased to be who she is. This quality shines through every one of her scenes in ""Being Julia"" even when the actress shes playing--Julia Lambert the reigning stage star of pre-World War II London--is supposed to be seized by self-doubt. Ms. Bening is the only reason to see the movie but a compelling reason.

A concierge and a lobby boy embark on a caper in 1932. Director Wes Anderson (139). R Language violence. Union Square Lincoln Square. Sometimes even when the visit is perfectly planned and the service impeccable you wind up leaving a place with a few minor reservations. But it isnt enough to spoil the overall experience. Thats how it is with Wes Andersons ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" the quirky directors latest confection now laced with newfound bitter historical truths. For fans of ""Rushmore"" (still his most enjoyable work) ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (his richest) and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (his most personal) it may feel like an extended trip with sophisticated relatives They have a lot to say but some patience is required too. Beginning as a story told within a story the plot begins as an elderly tycoon (F. Murray Abraham) recounts to a writer (Jude Law) how he came to own the titular hotel a once-shimmering example of European sophistication. The man is named Zero and decades earlier in 1932 he was a lobby boy (played by newcomer Tony Revolori) in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka. His employer is all-knowing Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) a fastidious concierge par excellence. Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" The fey but steely Gustave has enthusiasms (dowagers perfume) and has a talent for winning over those who dont immediately take to him (prison thugs checkpoint guards). Gustave cant maneuver though around the brutish son (Adrien Brody) of one of his wealthy lady friends who left him a priceless painting in her will. That painting and that will launch Gustave and Zero on a madcap adventure involving toboggan chases hired killers Kafkaesque bureaucrats and pink-boxed bon bons. Theres also love as Zero finds a girlfriend (Saoirse Ronan) and loyalty as the one-of-a-kind Gustaves central belief in civility is endangered by the imminent onset of war. Willem Dafoe and Adrien Brody in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" As with all of Andersons films the magic is in the cast. Fiennes with his rapid-fire delivery and rapier mustache is hilarious dapper and total perfection. Edward Norton Owen Wilson and Bill Murray -- as a member of a secret society of concierges -- hit their marks with ease. Willem Dafoe is a fang-toothed fiend in stiletto heels. Jeff Goldblum is a droll Freud-bearded moneyman. And as always the production design is a thing of beauty from the dandy exteriors to the various period details to the presentation the movie is shown in the old-fashioned boxy ratio of 1930s movies. Bill Murray as Mr. Ivan in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" But Andersons bigger ideas do get jumbled up in his caper. While not so serious as to dilute the joys of ""Budapest"" the script -- by the director and Hugo Guinness inspired by the writings of the once-famous now-obscure Austrian writer Stefan Zweig -- is a bit flighty. The result is a film almost too reliant on its players to push it through. Those players though are wonderful and more than ever their directors surrogates. They are articulate figurines moving through a world of quirky details that eagle-eyed aficionados will love. Anderson fans who classify themselves similarly will find details to savor. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" Thurs. - Sun. throughout the day on New Yorks WOR-710 AM and at wor710.com.

Share Tweet Wes Anderson doesnt so much direct movies as build them from scratch brick by colorful brick. Hes an architect of whimsy his brain an overstuffed filing cabinet of elaborate blueprints. To watch one of his comedies--and theyre all comedies from the boisterous Bottle Rocket to the magical Moonrise Kingdom--is to be ushered into a new world custom designed from top to bottom. Andersons latest invention The Grand Budapest Hotel may be his most meticulously realized beginning with the towering fictional building for which its named. From the outside this luxury establishment--situated in a scenic corner of an imaginary Eastern European country--resembles nothing so much as a giant frosted birthday cake delectable enough to devour. On the inside its a museum of invented history every room dressed with so much Andersonian stuff that it could inspire a whole series of spinoffs. Were the merit of the mans films determined solely by the amount of bric-a-brac they contain this new one would surely rank first in his illustrious filmography.To some The Grand Budapest Hotel probably will look like a career pinnacle if for no other reason than it crams all of its creators signature moves and interests into one zippy package. Superficially speaking Anderson has returned to the ensemble pleasures and literary affectations of his actual masterpiece The Royal Tenenbaums. Working for once without the input of a co-scripter the writer-director applies several layers of narrative remove his story beginning in a modern-day cemetery as a teenager cracks the spine of a novel called The Grand Budapest Hotel. The film quickly rewinds to the 80s to meet the author (Tom Wilkinson) then further back to the 60s to encounter him as a younger man (Jude Law) staying at the once-mighty now-dilapidated hotel of the title. There the aging owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) reminisces about his own 1930s salad days as a lobby boy (Tony Revolori) under the tutelage of concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). These multiple narrators are crucial Like a piece of juicy gossip passing through a crowd the past becomes romantically distorted each time its retold.Certainly a little creative embellishment might account for the impossible eccentricity of Gustave one of Andersons most incorrigible rapscallions. As played by Fiennes who exhibits a heretofore unseen playfulness Gustave is a man of particular peculiar taste--a devil-may-care dandy who prefers his chocolate decadent; his perfume pungent; and his women moneyed wizened and blonde (always blonde). He reserves his true passion however for his place of employment; for all the mans strange predilections he is first and foremost an aficionado of fine culture. In an instructive early scene Gustave extols the virtues of a priceless painting his gushing appraisal sounding like an argument for the kind of lush aesthetic pleasures Anderson himself holds dear. Of course he also knows how much the artwork would net him on the open market. Thats the character in a nutshell Thoughtful and refined one minute crassly opportunistic the next.Taking his cues from his protagonist Anderson has made a madcap caper that doubles as a winsome eulogy for such archaic virtues as glamour civility and dutiful customer service. Hes also assembled nearly all of his regular players--some dropping in for as little as a scene a shot even a few frames--while adding several game new participants to the troupe. The plot actually pivots around that beloved painting When one of his elderly satisfied ""customers"" (Tilda Swinton under a mass of convincing old-age makeup) dies of mysterious circumstances bequeathing him the valuable Boy With Apple mere hours before her demise Gustave is naturally accused of her murder. His attempts to prove his innocence with trusty Zero at his side and the authorities on his tail lend Grand Budapest the locomotive pacing of a classic romp. His visual imagination in overdrive Anderson stages several inspired chase sequences a daring prison break a suspenseful pursuit through an empty museum--all accompanied by the thrum and jangle of Alexandre Desplats lively score. Even more so than usual the director seems to have drawn inspiration from the morbid illustrations of Edward Gorey His black-clad villains played by Adrien Brody and Willem Dafoe are right out of one of the artists macabre collections as are the sudden flashes of darkly comic mayhem.The Grand Budapest Hotel is a delightful contraption of a film its characters gliding around like intricate moving parts its camera lurching with signature machine-like fluidity. Its not however one of Andersons best films. Gustave funny though he is never reveals the kind of hidden depths that distinguish the filmmakers great heroes--his Max Fischers his Royal Tenenbaums. Nor does Zeros polite-sidekick appeal blossom into anything richer even when Anderson grants him a tender romance with Saoirse Ronans brave baker. (Abraham to his immense credit supplies the lions share of the films sporadic poignancy.) Budapest turns its immaculately envisioned world inside and out offering generous glimpses of its mural-like exteriors and packing every inch of its interiors with idiosyncratic detail but it never quite breaches the cartoon surfaces of its characters whose melancholy is just another outfit pulled from the directors bottomless costume chest.No matter Eight features in and showing no sign of slowing down Anderson has reached the point in his artistic development where every new film--even a flavorful lark like The Grand Budapest Hotel--feels major. Loyalists will love it detractors will renew their objections and those who fell long and hard for Rushmore may be stricken by a nostalgic desire to see this essential American auteur collaborate again with Owen Wilson co-author of his earliest most sublime creations. As any Anderson connoisseur knows the mans true genius lies not with the eye-grabbing scenery but with the soulful neurotics capering through it.

In The Grand Budapest Hotel a wundercabinet set in the fictitious Eastern European republic of Zubrowka circa 1932 Anderson captures the collapse of a kingdom and rise of a reich without so much as an SS on a lapel. Here its a ZZ -- short for the Zig Zag Division -- a logo that looks so adorable engraved on martini shakers and ping-pong tables that you could almost but not quite forget that its adherents are going to destroy the world. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Andersons most mature film and his most visually witty too.Weve never seen a threat like the Zig Zags in Andersons films which tend to be fastidiously wallpapered wombs where man-children wrest with their delayed coming of age. At Andersons worst the films are as narcissistic as The Darjeeling Limited which was literally about rich white twerps making Indias working class deal with their baggage.Film DetailsCritics Pick The Grand Budapest Hotel RatingR GenreComedy Running Time100 min. More Info Trailer Initially Grand Budapest too appears to be one of his twee fantasies opening with an animated funicular huffing up a mountain backdrop to arrive at the titular hotel. But with a blink the image jumps from 1932 to 1968 and the building devolves from pink to drab. We realize that for once Anderson will let his airless snow globe be shaken and dropped and in this case crudely glued back together by Communism coyly referred to as the time of ""common property.""The Grand Budapest Hotel has the scope of a century. At the start a modern punk visits the memorial of a great unnamed novelist. Quickly we jump to 1985 and that author played by Tom Wilkinson reminiscing back two decades further still to when he was young enough to be played by Jude Law our handsomest character actor. Law plays the aspiring writer as a watchful insect the Graspacious socialclimbereum of the weather-beaten hotel during its post-glory years.When Law sits down for supper with the mysterious Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) the film once more leaps into the past to arrive at our main narrative the story of how young Moustafa (newcomer Tony Revolori) ascended from the Grand Budapests Junior Lobby Boy-in-training under supreme concierge Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) to owning the whole thing outright.Related StoriesBehind the Scenes of The Grand Budapest HotelIf youre counting Anderson is wrestling with four layers of fiction. Its fitting His characters have never sounded like real people and now he has an excuse for paragraph-length monologues delivered without a blink. At these Fiennes is brilliant. He understands that Anderson has a hard time distinguishing people from props and he plays Gustave as a bit of both a self-created legend who strides around the hotel like the Fred Astaire of housekeeping.Gustave is a fabulous contradiction a sincere hustler whos both fastidious and profane. Of his lovers all dowagers getting their groove back at the Grand Budapest hes clearly shagging them for the cash. Still he feeds their needs while proclaiming that their sagging flesh is ""more flavorful."" Even here in the past of the past of the past of the present hes a relic an honorable man who so values protocol that he greets death squads ""How do you do?"" (That said occasionally while in the middle of yet another speech on the value of civilization he snaps and moans ""Aw fuck it."")The thrust of the plot is Gustaves efforts to prove he didnt kill one of his heiresses (Tilda Swinton) a murder charge levied by her three tittering daughters and money-hungry son (Adrien Brody) who in his heavy black overcoat and crooked nose stalks the film like Poes raven.But the emotional drama is Gustaves struggle to keep order while chaos -- personal and geopolitical -- encroaches on his manicured fiefdom. Meanwhile were all too aware that its futile Soon the whole thing will be blown to bits and the generation after will have no use for gilded manners.Anderson was inspired by the works of Jewish novelist Stefan Zweig even dismissing his own script as ""more or less plagiarism."" Hes selling himself short. Zweig died in 1942 a suicide whod pulled up anchor in Vienna and fled to London then New York and fatally to Brazil after Hitler ascended to power. You wont hear the word ""Jewish"" here and Zweig was understandably more fatalistic. ""Europe is finished our world destroyed"" he lamented. But instead of offing himself with barbiturates Anderson wants to celebrate the world that was which is also we suspect the world he and his characters have always wished they lived in.

Its playful without being self-congratulatory and somehow lush without being cloying despite its obsession with a bakery that cranks out only one pastry a snowman-shaped confection with layers of pink green and cream. Its dotted with absurd jokes that I didnt catch until a second viewing; say a platter of duck that looks like roast pterodactyl.And both times I wanted to applaud the way cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman sneaks people like the villainous Willem Dafoe -- a ghoul with skull-encrusted brass knuckles -- into the shadows and then suddenly snaps them into focus.For once Ill allow Anderson his fripperies. With Gustave hes made us sympathizers in his own fight for beautiful trifles as though he sees his films as the front line in the battle against crass cash-in blockbusters. Like his doomed dandy Anderson wants to resurrect the high-toned Hollywood filmmaking that perhaps never even existed.As Moustafa smiles of Gustave at worst people can say these two nostalgists ""sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace.""THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL | Written and directed by Wes Anderson | Fox Searchlight | Landmark Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

The Grand Budapest Hotel is another giddy piece of period whimsy by Wes Anderson the deluded director of such brainless fruit salads as The Royal Tenenbaums The Darjeeling Limited Moonrise Kingdom the curious stop-motion animated film Fantastic Mr. Fox and four others. I hated them all. So I amaze myself by liking this latest lunatic cocktail as much as I do. For sure its another example of style over substance--a richly deserved accusation that is always leveled at this kindergarten cop of a director but I confess its a lot of scattered and disjointed fun. The Grand Budapest Hotel  (3/4 stars) Written by Wes Anderson and Hugo Guinness Directed by Wes AndersonStarring Ralph Fiennes F. Murray Abraham and Edward NortonRunning time 99 min. Lavish to look at adorned with frills and froth that greet the eye and grate the logic of any otherwise sane person The Grand Budapest Hotel is like one of those scrumptious lavender Louis Sherry candy boxes from the turn of the century you sometimes see at art shows and memorabilia auctions. You marvel at the fancy curlicues and ribbons on the outside of the purple and gold box promising a cornucopia of delectable contents inside until you open it up and find it empty. Here instead of assorted candied fruits chocolate-covered nuts and chewy caramels you get a carousel of characters in colorful wigs moustaches and costumes observed by the concierge of a luxurious hotel-spa in a fictional country of Mr. Andersons invention called Zubrowka nestled in the Alps of Eastern Europe between World Wars I and II. Monsieur Gustave (played with delightful relish by Ralph Fiennes) watches them all come and go missing nothing. His stories and adventures are related in the year 1985 to an author (Tom Wilkinson) who wants to collect them in a book just as they were observed in the 1930s by the hotel lobby boy an immigrant named Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who is now the owner of the once-splendid resort. With novel chapter headings the fairy-tale narrative unfolds in staunchly staged flashbacks. Monsieur Gustave was a flamboyant bisexual meticulously dressed and reeking of perfume who called all men ""darling"" and seduced women of every age. When his most illustrious lover the eccentric 84-year-old dowager empress Madame Celine Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton looking like a cross between Miss Havisham in Great Expectations and Abraham Lincoln in drag buried by a pound of Max Factor) is murdered leaving him a painting worth millions Gustave is set upon by a nest of human cobras who want the painting for themselves. The den of villains is crowded with amusing cameos by Mathieu Amalric as the suspicious butler Serge X; Jeff Goldblum as Madame D.s evil executor Kovacs; a sadist in leather (Willem Dafoe); and the dead womans son (Adrien Brody). Framed for murder Gustave and his sidekick Zero stage an elaborate prison break with Harvey Keitel aided by Zeros girlfriend Agatha (the enchanting Saoirse Ronan) named after Agatha Christie and the creator of elaborate pastries from Mendls bakery. While solving the mystery of the stolen art and clearing his good name from the annals of crime the indefatigable Gustave finds time to service a multitude of admirers deliver nightly sermons to the hotel staff and dodge the pursuit of a Nazi S.S. officer named Henckels (Edward Norton unrecognizable behind a handlebar moustache). Zany doesnt begin to cover it. The sets are fabulous from the crimson carpets and pomegranate wall tapestries of the hotel through snowy forests to the magnificent schlosses and castles of a fantasy paradise replete with a prison surrounded by a moat full of crocodiles. Agatha does miraculous things with buttercreams that look like Faberge eggs and has a scar across half of her face that looks like a map of Mexico. The cannons and sabers are so elaborately designed you cant wait for them to join the action. Theres so much to look at--the brass-knuckle violence the severed head in a laundry basket the cable car high above the Alps the sister with a club foot destined to be the next murder victim--you forget that what youre really seeing is charming elaborate tomfoolery. The inspired set pieces like the insides of vintage music boxes overshadow the cardboard figures that inhabit them. In the nonstop overdose of whimsy and imagination you almost dread the querulous madrigal in your brain that asks At what point does the plot thicken? Is the movie a metaphor for Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies? While the references to everything from Ernst Lubitsch to Grand Hotel pile up you forget its all taking place against a background of rising Hitlerism and postwar communism that means half of the staff and guests at the Grand Budapest Hotel will fall to ruin before the hotel does. I had an enjoyable time cataloging the unfolding feasts for the eye while the world behind the windows waits for the bomb but ultimately I dont think the movie makes much of a political point at all. Beating Monsieur Gustave to the punch Mr. Anderson seduces us all dusting off a world of creeping horror with Mitteleuropa charm. He keeps everybody smiling ignoring the encroaching darkness lurking under the marzipan.

That marks me as a heretic in some circles but what has always been frustrating to me -- and a little mysterious -- about my rejection of the Anderson aesthetic is that I truly do recognize what a gifted and original filmmaker he is. For the first 20 minutes of most of his movies I am bedazzled -- at the majestically framed madly detailed compositions at the storybook universes he sets up with words and pictures and music and familiar actors in strange mustaches. At a certain point though I feel like Im staring at all of that profuse imagination through a scrim. I can see the characters but I cant touch them -- not emotionally. With the exception of his 2009 animated fable Fantastic Mr. Fox Andersons films to me grow detached and monotonous. Theyre baubles under glass. But now Ive had my Wes Anderson breakthrough -- or maybe its that hes had his. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a marvelous contraption a wheels-within-wheels thriller thats pure oxygenated movie play. I cant say that I felt a deep connection to the characters in this one either yet that hardly matters because the movie is just a caper and it has no real pretense beyond hurtling forward through a wonderland of funny and suspenseful fairy-tale predicaments. That makes it a much looser freer invention than Andersons usual control-freak ant farm. The film is set in Zubrowka a fictional 30s European nation that Anderson treats as a glorious semiruined Old World kingdom with hotels castles and prisons all perched vertiginously atop alpine vistas. The fabulous buildings are like layer cakes -- inside and out they satisfy Andersons love for compositional awesomeness -- but they also root the film in a kind of antiquated reality. The central character Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) is the concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel and hes a con man and gigolo who speaks in outrageously flowing yet blunt-witted sentences explaining his schemes to us one of which involves bedding the wealthy old women who arrive at the hotel for spa vacations. He confesses that he actually likes going to bed with them and that one sordid detail casually knocks the movie out of Andersons usual stylized puritan zone. So does the films jarring use of the F-word It liberates Fiennes -- and Anderson. (They make that word sound naughty again.) The Grand Budapest Hotel is the story of a man with an appetite and Fiennes who tends to be so dour and earnest on screen digs into the chance to play a florid scoundrel driven by worldly desire and by his own twisted code of honor. The story is told through the eyes of Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) a poker-faced orphan-immigrant Lobby Boy who becomes Gustaves hotel protege. (Decades later Zero is played as a wily old man by F. Murray Abraham looking back on the events were seeing.) What happens in essence is this One of Gustaves conquests the 84-year-old countess Madame D. (Tilda Swinton looking unrecognizably like a dowager who just stepped out of Barry Lyndon) dies and theres a furious battle over her will. She has left Gustave a priceless (and hilariously fey) painting called Boy With Apple. But her relatives including Adrien Brody as their scowling fascist ringleader and Willem Dafoe as a thug who looks like Frankenberry with a crew cut are so ruthless that Gustave has to steal it. Set just as World War II (or a tall-tale version of it) is starting The Grand Budapest Hotel turns into an avaricious wartime chase thriller with stops for an episode at a criminal internment camp (where Gustave participates in a great escape) and also for a toboggan race that out-jaw-drops anything you saw in the recent Olympics. Its all nudged along by a wonderful timpani-driven score by Alexandre Desplat that does for this movie what his music in Fantastic Mr. Fox did for that one makes it hum with intricate momentum. The Grand Budapest Hotel is still every inch a Wes Anderson film but a new breed of one since Anderson for the first time is out to enchant us without ""saying"" anything. For me that lets him say more.

Let it be said that somewhere along the way after his mighty The Royal Tenenbaums and before Fantastic Mr. Fox cozy became interchangeable with stifling and the directors perfectionism started to feel like a noose (at least to this neck). All Anderson had to do was fling open the doors The Grand Budapest Hotel set in a towering pink mansion situated somewhere in a dreamlike 1930s Alps plays like a breakthrough. Its main character is a beloved concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes cutting loose with his underutilized comic chops) who might as well be an elegant yet foulmouthed version of the filmmaker himself. His regime boasts military precision but his code is one of love as Gustave literally falls into bed with all his guests by his own happy admission. Smartly Anderson adds a foil Zero our narrator (voiced in older decaying days by F. Murray Abraham) once upon a time a young lobby boy with a drawn-on mustache. Newcomer Tony Revolori plays him with the quaking excitement of an acolyte. Imagine Rushmore from the point of view of Maxs intense No. 2 Dirk Calloway and youre in the zone. A small shift but a significant one Andersons universe as refined as ever is under siege. Exterior forces of fascism like a dead guests furious grandson (Adrien Brody) and his thuglike henchman (Willem Dafoe) gather representing the end of happy days. The auteurs style--dramatic zooms winking symmetry--is balanced against a newfound political context; this ones his To Be or Not to Be.

Photo Fox Searchlight MOVIE REVIEW The Grand Budapest Hotel Running time 99 minutes. Rated R (profanity violence sexual situations). At the Lincoln Square and the Union Square. The most Wes Anderson-y moment of the almost excruciatingly Wes Anderson-y new Wes Anderson movie ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the arrival at a prison security desk of foodstuffs meant for the inmates. A loaf of bread? Violently stabbed. A sausage? Sliced to bits. Then comes an enchanting little pastry a frail folly of icing and butter. To check it for the hidden and forbidden would be to destroy it. So the guards (unseen unremarked upon) simply pass it through untouched. It contains of course digging tools with which our heroes will break out of prison. A world that worked Andersons way would be delicious to contemplate but this self-consciously zany film is a take on Central Europe in the 20th century. The thing that Anderson knows about WWI is that the Germans wore these funny mustaches. WWII? He finds the SS logo wacky. Let me back up as the film does Beginning in 1985 it shoots back to the 60s. A bored writer played by Jude Law staying in a run-down garishly Commie-colored Alpine hotel meets an old man Zero Moustafa played by F. Murray Abraham. He turns out to be the hotels mysterious owner. As a boy in the 1930s (we flittingly flash back again) Zero was a lobby boy and aide to the manic master concierge M. Gustave (played with queeny gusto by Ralph Fiennes) whose habit of romancing elderly rich women has left him with a fortune after one of them (Tilda Swinton) died. Willem Dafoe and Adrien Brody star in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel""Photo Fox Searchlight She willed M. Gustave a priceless painting but Gustave and Zero steal it anyway pursued by the wills executor (Jeff Goldblum) her incensed Nazi-ish son (Adrien Brody) and an accompanying assassin (Willem Dafoe). Zero romances a pastry baker (Saoirse Ronan) who has a birthmark shaped liked Mexico because why wouldnt she? M. Gustave gets thrown in prison joins a cabal with fellow inmates (Harvey Keitel pops up) escapes with the aid of a mysterious international brotherhood of concierges (here we edge too close to ""The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders"" the ""SNL"" spoof of Anderson) and -- you get the picture. Theres whimsy on offer industrial-grade. The second time I saw the film (I have a feeling Ill be reluctantly reviewing it several more times Anderson puts so much vigor into the films that he makes you want to repay the favor) I more or less gave up on the intentionally ridiculous plot and tried to view the film in the inside-out way Anderson prefers. The mise-en-scene the frivolity and the froth arent just added attractions Theyre everything. If a character should be shot by a firing squad or strangled in a confessional its all part of the mad whirl. The effect is droll at best tedious at worst which means that I have to consign ""GBH"" to the slappable corner of the Anderson oeuvre together with ""The Life Aquatic"" and ""The Darjeeling Limited."" Movies like ""The Great Dictator"" and ""To Be or Not To Be"" lampooned Nazis with forceful satire. ""GBH"" is a featherweight screwball comedy that trying mightily to be cosmopolitan feels awfully provincial desperately touristy Europe is just this nutty place where a lot of crazy mixed-up stuff happened and look at this darling model ski lift Thats Wes Anderson He cant see the forest for the twee.

By Dana Stevens Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave in The Grand Budapest Hotel Courtesy of Fox Searchlight After you see The Grand Budapest Hotel come back and listen to our Spoiler Special Theres a beautiful three-tiered pastry frosted in shades of pale pink and mint green that plays a significant part in Wes Andersons The Grand Budapest Hotel. It comes from an elegant old-world bakery called Mendls in the fictional country of Zubrowka and its favored for both culinary and sentimental reasons by Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) the owner of the formidable establishment named in the title. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. That huge pink hilltop hotel is really just a larger and more complex version of the cake with both in turn nested Russian-doll style inside the even bigger and more elaborate confection that is the movie itself. The Grand Budapest Hotel is both an example of and an elegy for a certain kind of old-world craft whose passing the story explicitly mourns. The Grand Budapest is to Moustafa--and to its previous owner the fastidious Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes)--what this film or all his films really are to Anderson a lovingly tended alternate universe where the colors are crisper the work ethic stronger the friendships more honorable. And like a well-run hotel a Wes Anderson movie only functions as a complete system with references conventions and running jokes taking the place of bellhops laundry chutes and dumbwaiters. Advertisement Remember the line in Enough Said when Julia Louis-Dreyfus character announces she loves dollhouse furniture so much she wants to eat it? As a fellow lifelong aficionado of miniatures models and dollhouses I couldnt help but salivate at the sumptuous surfaces and cunning design of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Even when he isnt using literal stop-motion-animated miniatures (which he does in a few scenes here including absurdly and charmingly during the mountaintop action climax) Anderson seems to be building himself and his cast a space in which to play as hes done before most explicitly in The Life Aquatic The Darjeeling Limited and Fantastic Mr. Fox. Anderson has become one of our most reliable cinematic bringers of sensory delight His movies dont just have colors and sounds but almost as palpable textures tastes and smells. (A recurring gag in Budapest involves M. Gustaves daily self-spritzing with his beloved scent LAir de Panache which has been developed as a ""concept fragrance"" by a French parfumier in one of those whimsical-luxury-product tie-ins that always seem to spring up around Wes Anderson movies.) Andersons moral and political imagination hasnt always kept pace with his cinematic one. Are Andersons movies themselves little more than whimsical luxury products? Im not of that school though when the director is at his fussiest (as he is here) I can sometimes feel sympathy with its members. Its been thrilling in the decade and a half since Rushmore was released to watch Anderson cultivate both a distinctive visual style and a traveling company of actors musicians and behind-the-scenes craftspeople to help realize his idiosyncratic visions. But as Ive written elsewhere in the past few years his moral and political imagination hasnt always kept pace with his cinematic one--his meticulous attention to surfaces together with his actors trademark uninflected delivery can sometimes serve as distancing devices to keep messy or painful emotions at bay. (Multiple spoilers from previous Wes Anderson movies in the parenthetical to come Im thinking of the Indian boy who drowns in The Darjeeling Limited the death of Owen Wilsons character in The Life Aquatic or the loneliness of the orphaned boy in Moonrise Kingdom.) In The Grand Budapest Hotel Anderson takes on the messiest most painful subject hes tackled yet war. Though the threat that hangs over Zubrowka is like the country itself fictional the atmosphere of Europe between the world wars is unmistakable as a thuggish occupying army with uniforms bearing an SS-like double-zigzag pattern patrols the trains and borders of the once-elegant Zubrowkan republic now in decline. Anderson has said that he based the film in part on motifs from the work of the Viennese writer Stefan Zweig a Jew who fled Austria when Hitler came to power and wound up committing suicide in Brazil. And the films second main character--the young Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) M. Gustaves devoted ""lobby boy""--is a refugee from political turmoil himself a war orphan whos come to find his fortune in Zubrowka after escaping torture in a fictional Middle Eastern country. (These horrors are recounted in the same rapid-fire deadpan style as the comic dialogue--an aesthetic choice that for me eventually served to flatten out both the storys sorrow and its joy.) To explain this movies central caper plot we have to get back to that Russian-doll nesting structure I mentioned earlier which applies to the movies time frame as well. In 1985 a figure known only as ""The Author"" (played by Tom Wilkinson) sits down to pen a nostalgic memoir about his fond memories of the hotel he visited as a young man. We then flash back to 1968 when a younger Author (Jude Law) visiting the now vaguely Soviet-style hotel finds himself invited to dine in the Budapests vast near-empty restaurant with the mysterious proprietor Zero (Abraham). In another flashback to 1932 which will take up most of the rest of the film Zero begins to recount his early days at the hotel when as a very young man he was taken under the wing of the hotels persnickety and dandyish but ultracompetent chief concierge M. Gustave. Sensing his lobby boys gift for whats now depressingly known as ""the hospitality industry"" Gustave resolves to nurture Zeros budding talent as a hotelier. (Gustave and Zeros prickly but loving mentor/mentee relationship is not unlike the Jason Schwartzman/Bill Murray connection in what is still my favorite Anderson movie Rushmore.) One of Gustaves defining eccentricities is his weakness for elderly female hotel guests who he routinely seduces and services as seen in an early montage thats unusually raunchy for Wes Anderson. When one of his wealthy paramours Madame D. (Tilda Swinton in some crazy-convincing age makeup) meets with foul play Gustave is framed for her murder by her malevolent son Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis (Adrien Brody). With Zeros help (and that of Zeros true love a pure-hearted pastry chef played by Saoirse Ronan) Gustave must dig his way out of a maximum-security prison recover a hidden painting that hes stolen from the Desgoffe-und-Taxis estate and escape a merciless hired assassin (Willem Dafoe) all the while maintaining a spotlessly starched shirtfront and trailing a fragrant cloud of LAir de Panache. As played with a melancholy rakishness by the handsomer-than-ever Fiennes M. Gustave is one of Andersons more memorable creations--but hes stranded in a movie that for all its gorgeous frills and furbelows (including a lush musical score by Alexandre Desplat and a surfeit of charming cameos from Anderson regulars like Jason Schwartzman Ed Norton and Bill Murray) never seemed to me to be quite sure what it was about. Youth age rivalry and mentorship? Nostalgia for a lost way of life? The ineluctable slaughterhouse of 20th-century European history? These are big dark themes ideas that the director (who also wrote the screenplay with a story assist from his friend Hugo Guinness) seems both obsessed by and game to explore. But somehow Anderson never quite lets himself (or his characters or by extension us) get to the deepest darkest places those paths might lead. Though theres more swearing and more blood than are usually to be found in this directors work--the unpleasant fate of an estate lawyer played by Jeff Goldblum is as close as Andersons ever come to black-comic gore--everything remains in that familiar register of chilly stylish remove. The voice-over epilogue hastily relates several important characters shockingly bleak fates--then quickly gives way to a playful credit sequence scored to sprightly balalaika music. Id like to think of this as Anderson dancing on the brink of the abyss but it still feels like hes leaving a healthy margin between himself and the edge.

Anderson tells a story within a story within a story. (There might be one more story--I lost track.) First a young girl pays tribute to the statue of a dead author; then said author (Tom Wilkinson) narrates a trip that his middle-aged self (Jude Law) took to a Mitteleuropaisch hotel the Grand Budapest faded but with remnants of its older opulence; and finally the owner Mr. Moustafa (F.a-Murray Abraham) recounts to the author his time between the world wars as a lowest-of-low lobby boy known as Zero (Tony Revolori) under the tutelage of the legendary concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Andersons inspiration comes from the late Stefan Zweig who wrote with an abundance of detail fearful the past would pass from memory and therefore cease to exist. Anderson materializes Zweigs world as if answering a prayer. Not literally. The Grand Budapest Hotel has no pretense to realism Its mode is whimsical impressionism. But the artists share a common loneliness and their twin yearnings merge. The movies philosophical core is in its palette starting with Andersons trademark off-symmetrical frames increasingly precarious seesaws of shape and color. He is however beginning to break out of his (over)reliance on tableaux vivants. The mountainside hotel is a dollhouse reached by model train but inside its like Dr. Whos tardis Vistas expand contract and pirouette. The lobby choreography is busy layered militaristically efficient. The colors are intense pink walls crimson carpets staff waistcoats of electric magenta. Has Anderson ever designed a house? Imagine a walking tour of favorite directors. Tim Burton could build a cave across the street. Paul Greengrasss place would be on a canal to simulate nonstop Shakicam. I digress but Anderson makes you dream of designs for living on a higher (or funkier) plane. Theres a melodramatic plot if youre wondering. Gustave treats his customers with deference and his rich-old-lady customers with concupiscence--he fucks them silly. One (Tilda Swinton withered by greasepaint and putty) has a premonition of her death and when news comes that she is indeed gone Gustave grabs the boy Zero and boards a dangerous train--theres yet another war breaking out--for her manse. Soon hes being blamed for her murder and hunted by police (led by Edward Nortons Henkels who has a story of his own about Gustave befriending him as a lonely lad) and a macabre grim-faced assassin (Willem Dafoe). The last half of The Grand Budapest Hotel has a madcap abandon undreamed of in other Anderson movies with a chase through the Alps thats staged and shot like a pipe dream of flight. Fellow European concierges lend the lamming Gustave a hand much as sundry guest stars lend their wattage to the movie Bill Murray Jeff Goldblum Owen Wilson Adrien Brody Jason Schwartzman Harvey Keitel Matthieu Amalric Bob Balaban. Anderson is a sort of Pied Piper who picks up actors as he goes along Sure Wes Ill put on a costume and let you pose me for a day. It would be nice if these actors had you know roles. But pop-up cameos have been a source of pleasure in movies from almost year one and they give Andersons mise-en-scene a family vibe. Andersons visuals are so witty and exacting they transcend camp but his dialogue alas doesnt Its twee in the extweem. An old stage pro like Fiennes can speak his speeches trippingly and make them sound Wildean (his aplomb is gorgeous) but I cant remember a single one of Gustaves lines and hes by far the most eloquent character. The boy Zero is the audiences stand-in which means he largely stands there mouth-breathing. He listens obeys Gustaves orders and runs and hides on cue. His romance with a pretty girl (Saoirse Ronan) with a geographically fascinating birthmark has nothing as deft as the rapport between prepubescents in Moonrise Kingdom. The best least predictable dialogue in an Anderson movie is in The Darjeeling Limited written with Schwartzman and Roman Coppola. The best least predictable performance is Gene Hackmans in The Royal Tenenbaums largely because Hackmans ferociously stubborn Method went against the too-smooth Anderson grain. (Hackman reportedly didnt take well to being given line readings.) One reason I dont respond as fully to Andersons movies--even this one--as his critical groupies is that his characters are so small monotonous dear. To maintain childlike wonder an artist doesnt need to turn his or her people into simpletons. There is to be fair a case you can make for the movies campy ingenuousness. It seduces you even as Anderson hints at the deadliness lurking in this high societys margins. It leaves you undefended for the final emotional wallop. There were a mere 15 years between the gruesome senseless slaughter of World War I and the Reichstag fire that presaged the devastation of Europe by Fascists and this magical wisp of an era would pass. The final scenes are handled with delicacy You dont cry so much as shiver. And then you slowly begin the readjustment to a world in which the people are less exuberant the proportions less harmonious the colors less vivid.

By J.R. Jones Jr_Jones Owen Wilson in The Grand Budapest Hotel click to enlarge The Missing Picture The Grand Budapest Hotel  Directed by Wes Anderson The Missing Picture  Directed by Rithy Panh Even if youve never seen a Wes Anderson movie youve probably seen the American Express commercial he made in 2004 which was ubiquitous on American TV between takes on a movie set the hip young director marches around giving instructions to his actors noting the makeup job on a geisha character conferring with his prop man on a suitable weapon for a scene (""Can you do a .357 with a bayonet?"") and putting a 15000 helicopter rental on his AmEx before he seats himself on a camera crane and floats heavenward. This giddy episode always reminds me of that old Orson Welles saw in which he referred to the RKO studio lot as ""the biggest train set a boy ever had."" The primary appeal of Andersons movies is this very sense of a spoiled kid having the time of his life. Over the years Andersons cult following has built steadily though his filmography has had its ups and downs. After three strong comedies fueled by adolescent angst and family dysfunction (Bottle Rocket Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums) he apparently exhausted whatever personal issues he had to rake over and began spinning ever-more-fanciful tales of little oddball communities in exotic locales (the oceanographers of The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou the brothers exploring India by train in The Darjeeling Limited the 12-year-old sweethearts and their families on the mythical island of New Penzance in Moonrise Kingdom). With each new feature his eccentric visual style becomes more pronounced even as his characters seem flatter and more cartoonish. Andersons movies can be wonderfully funny and fun to look at but they often give me the feeling that Im watching a grown man play with dolls. The Grand Budapest Hotel transpires in another mythical land the former Republic of Zubrowka and Anderson uses stop-motion animation to portray the hotel (which looks like a giant pink wedding cake) and its mountainous environs (serviced by steep funicular railway cars). Theres an elaborate narrative frame involving an author (Tom Wilkinson) who remembers his 1968 visit to the hotel and his dinner conversation there with the elderly owner Mr. Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). But the core of the story is Moustafas reminiscence of his days in the 1930s as a lobby boy (Tony Revolori) under the tutelage of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) a dapper concierge and wooer of rich old women. Storm clouds are gathering in Europe and neo-Nazis wearing ""ZZ"" emblems on their collars threaten young Zero an orphan and refugee from an unnamed Middle Eastern land. Anderson shot the movie on location in Germany and for the hotel he located an empty art nouveau department store in Gorlitz with magnificent crisscrossing stairways which he and production designer Adam Stockhausen converted into the stunningly colorful hotel lobby. The sense of being in a dollhouse is complete reinforced by Andersons boxy visual style. Hes always loved the comic-strip feel of proscenium framing and like Stanley Kubrick he has a mania for symmetrical compositions. Often he gathers his characters together for posed shots in which they sit for the camera as if he were lining them up for play. Anderson is one of the few directors working today who can actually get laughs with a camera and his signature move--a horizontal pan that suddenly reverses itself as if one were doing a double take--is all over The Grand Budapest Hotel along with vertical pans to the floors above and comic zooms that pull us through windows and into other rooms. No amount of visual invention can substitute for characters though and Anderson doesnt so much write characters anymore as recruit a great cast and dress them up in The Grand Budapest Hotel Tilda Swinton dons old-age makeup to play one of M. Gustaves paramours Adrien Brody twirls a wax moustache as her enraged son Bill Murray wears muttonchops as a courtly concierge at another hotel Willem Dafoe plays a vicious thug with a flattop and underbite dentures that make him look like a bulldog and Saoirse Ronan as young Zero Moustafas love interest sports a big red beauty mark on her cheek in the shape of Mexico. When we learn that Zeros parents were both murdered during civil strife in their native land and that M. Gustave later comes to a tragic end such grim events seem to transpire in a different world from the candy-colored building of the title.  The Missing Picture a recent Oscar nominee for best documentary also tells the story of a boy whose parents died at the hands of political oppressors though in this case it really happened. In April 1975 after the Khmer Rouge took power in Cambodia young Rithy Panh and his family were turned out of their home in Phnom Penh herded with their neighbors into railway boxcars taken to the countryside and forced to labor on collective farms that were supposed to erase all class distinctions in Cambodian society. Their possessions were confiscated their clothes dyed black their names changed as part of their political ""reeducation."" Anyone daring to challenge the revolutionary wisdom or even speak about the past was executed. Panhs high school was turned into a torture center and his brother a rock-and-roller disappeared. First his father and then his mother starved to death in the ensuing famine. Some artists turn people into dolls and some turn dolls into people. In The Missing Picture Panh dramatizes his experiences using dozens and dozens of little clay figurines only two or three inches tall which he carves paints and assembles against large dioramas re-creating his neighborhood in Phnom Penh and the muddy farms where he and his parents toiled. The movie breaks the fourth wall with close-ups of his hands as he works on the little figures and their hollowed-out faces are haunting. ""The revolution is pure"" Panh observes in his simple but eloquent voice-over narration. ""No need for humans."" Yet the practice of carving the figurines paradoxically turns these victims of mass dehumanization back into people with their own individual hopes dreams and sorrows. The Missing Picture is every bit as fanciful as The Grand Budapest Hotel with a comparable sense of the filmmaker fashioning his characters by hand but unlike Anderson whose movies retreat ever further from reality Panh confronts and transcends it. The challenge of making a full-length feature from still figures is enormous and Panh meets it with considerable ingenuity. Ongoing characters such as the family members are carved in multiple poses to inject a little variety into the ""action"" and the diorama settings are enhanced by evocative background noise on the soundtrack. Panh incorporates black-and-white archival footage of the Khmer Rouge putting people through their endless paces in the rice fields and even superimposes his own figures onto those scenes. Besides the clay figurines his primary visual motif is the unspooling of 35-millimeter film stock dredged up from the 70s and freed from its chemical-encrusted canisters; the movie opens with lush color footage showing a dancer in traditional costume which has nothing to do with the story per se but conjures up a lost world of beauty and romance. ""I seek my childhood like a missing picture"" Panh explains in his narration which seems like a natural impulse for a man whose personal possessions including family photos and anything else signifying his past life were stripped away. In a striking coincidence The Missing Picture also imagines a film studio as the biggest train set a boy ever had. When Panh was growing up in Phnom Penh one of his neighbors was a film director and Panh spent countless hours watching him work. ""I loved the wonderful wigs and costumes the colors and gold the land of giants and fairy tales"" he recalls. His diorama of the studio is populated by dozens of clay extras crew members and actors not to mention the director calling through his megaphone; a long horizontal pan across the entire scene uncannily replicates Wes Andersons American Express commercial. But this world was lost too under the Khmer Rouge film artists were executed or sent out to the rice fields to atone for their vanity. You have to wonder why they didnt hire a helicopter and get the hell out of there. Surely they could have put it on the card.

His films overflow with intricate detail and make no pretence of existing in a world other than their own just-about-earthbound parallel universe. So the five-star premises of his energetic new comedy The Grand Budapest Hotel - a wedding-cake-like pastel-coloured establishment situated somewhere in 1930s Mitteleuropa and peopled by eccentrics and lunatics - feel like business as usual. Whats different though is that the films shaggy-dog sort-of-whodunit yarn offers laughs and energy that make this Andersons most fun film since Rushmore. Where Moonrise Kingdom had heart The Grand Budapest Hotel has pace and a winning manic streak. It also gives Ralph Fiennes a rare comic role as Monsieur Gustave a concierge who wavers brilliantly between thug and gentleman aesthete. From Gustaves mouth pours a head-spinning cocktail of politeness and filth as he becomes embroiled in the murder investigation and inheritance tussles that follow the death of one of his most loyal guests the elderly Madame D (Tilda Swinton barely recognisable beneath a carapace of make-up). At Gustaves side is his loyal apprentice Zero Moustafa (newcomer Tony Revolori with a drawn-on pencil moustache) who decades later (now played by F Murray Abraham) recounts events over dinner to a writer played by Jude Law. The rest of Andersons cast is sprawling and starry. Blink and you might miss Bill Murray Owen Wilson Jason Schwartzman and others in tiny roles. A bruising Adrien Brody and a Rottweiler-like Willem Dafoe represent a violent new European order - one of them is kitted out all in black no less. In its own indirect and loopy fashion is this Andersons most political film? It tips its hat to 1930s history in the way Hitchcock tipped his viewfinder to the same decades current affairs with The Lady Vanishes (both films share a hotel a train and an old woman at the centre of a mischievous mystery). Like the ship of The Life Aquatic or the townhouse of The Royal Tenenbaums The Grand Budapest Hotel comes with its own ready-made theatre and uniformed cast. From here Anderson breaks out with verve on to trains ski runs and cobbled streets to spin a wickedly funny tale that celebrates the final glory days of a dying world order. Its all given a bombastic lift by an Alexandre Desplat score which crescendos in organs and drums. Full of Andersons visual signatures - cameras that swerve quick zooms speedy montages - its familiar in style refreshing in tone and one of Andersons very best films.

And I felt I was devouring it rather than watching it. Each individual scene is beautifully constructed the audience is submerged in a demi-monde of outrageous colour and flamboyant style.It roars along at a Keaton-esque pace of comic brilliance. The louche character of Gustave H. is superb and Ralph Fiennes timing is astounding. The whole ensemble cast are brilliant especially the new talent (Tony Revolori) playing Zero.I cannot remember leaving a cinema recently so thoroughly entertained and light-hearted.

Some of my friends told me that they hated it and walked out before the end but I really dont understand why. Its not the second coming or Apocalypse Now or Citizen Kane or something else packed with tremendous meaning (watch Inside Out for that). Its just an amusing film. Ralph Fiennes is often wooden in his films but is fully alive here and its great to see Adrien Brody finally take on a role worth his talent (now if he can only find another movie like The Pianist to do).Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 4 2016nicknicknTastemakerFeaturedThe Grand Budapest Hotel is light frothy escapism. The story is unlikely but likeable. The sets and set pieces are extraordinary and absorbing. The jokes are off-beat and sometimes off-colour. The costumes and the acting are camp.

So many different streams to the story that it sometimes seems to lose its way but it gets there in the end. Lots of star performances in this Fiennes and the relatively unknown Tony Revolori are a fantastic partnership and there are some great moments from Owen Wilson Adrian Brody Jude Law and Bill Murray.

If this film really were of 4 star quality it would have been released at least a couple months before the awards so it were nominated.  No film studios going to hold off making a few bucks with all the publicity an award would give the film by waiting another year for a film to be nominated..Admittedly its better than a lot of other things released this week but thats not saying much.

Andersons colorful period piece reflects the sensibilities of its creator at the height of his artistic confidence. While it notably draws from preexisting material -- namely the writings of Viennese intellectual Stefan Zweig though Anderson has also tipped his hat to various other wartime literature -- one of Americas most distinguished modern auteurs has spun his clutter of reference points into a collage-like fantasy adventure so clearly fused with the rest of his oeuvre that it belongs to the writer-director more than anyone else. Yet within the constraints of his distinctive tinkering Anderson remains a compelling storyteller who provides an actors playground in this case providing Ralph Fiennes with one of his most distinguished roles. While it has many familiar ingredients -- from the atmosphere to the ensemble of Anderson regulars in nearly every role -- in its allegiance to Andersons vision everything about ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a welcome dose of originality. ""Once the public knows youre a writer the stories come to you"" says a narrator in the movies opening minutes and that certainly fits this unrestrained blend of quirk melancholia and storybook imagery which takes place in a made-up country during wartime and unspools as a flamboyant insuppressibly joyous farce that could only have arrived with the ongoing confirmation of Andersons talent. The danger with his particular sort of creativity comes the usual trapping of placing form ahead of content His homegrown style often borders on sensory overload -- each neatly designed color scheme and snappy exchange can lead to a string of visual sugar highs like icing with no cake beneath -- and ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" threatened to devolve into self-parody. But everything since then has shown a steady process of refinement. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" ultimately succeeds like the similarly ostentatious ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" at applying its capriciousness to a set of fascinating characters and real drama underneath the sense of play. Part action-comedy and crime caper as well as a keen satire of the same bravura fueling the filmmaking the writer-directors eighth feature contains a dense plot that unfurls through two layers of narration Jude Law as a young Zweig-like writer visiting the palatial hotel in the fictional European mountain country of Zubrowska in the late eighties comes across the cryptically cheery owner Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) and asks him about his history at the hotel. While a modern day Law narrates their encounter Moustafas narration sends the movie back to 1932 where the main action takes place. The expressive art direction literally expands beyond the frame Each period receives its own distinctive aspect ratio -- most significantly the Academy ratio of 1.33 for the main flashback with the boxed-in look aptly reflecting the story-within-a-story framing device. The central figure of this period is equally a figure of fantasy on par with the setting Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) the giddy concierge of the Grand Budapest Hotel who happily seduces the older clientele while offering dubious life advice to the young doting bellboy Zero (newcomer Tony Revolori playing the youthful version of Abrahams character). When one of Gustaves elderly paramours suddenly dies (Tilda Swinton under pounds of makeup in a handful of scenes) leaving a priceless artifact in Gustaves possession he faces two oppressive forces at once A skeptical police crew (led by a comically mustachioed Edward Norton) convinced Gustave committed the crime while the deceased womans crafty son Dmitry (Adrian Brody) aims to prevent Gustave from claiming the prize and sets loose the vampiric hitman Jopling (Willem Dafoe) on a path of violence. While chaos ensues Gustave rarely looses his smirking bravado as he barks orders at Zero ostensibly the real hero of the story as he develops a romance with the towns young baker (Saoroise Ronan) and slowly transitions from shyness to take control of the situation. The resulting chemistry between Gustave and the increasingly confidant Zero as they head across the countryside with various forces on their trail consolidates aspects of several recent Anderson ventures Like ""The Darjeeling Limited"" much of the exposition takes place on a train; like ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" chase scenes maintain a marvelous cartoon-like fluidity; as with ""Moonrise Kingdom"" the goofy romance and high stakes plot belie the sincerely touching relationships beneath the surface. But ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" manages a trickier balance than its predecessors juggling a speedy plot with striking imagery and perceptive characterizations in the bubbly spirit of a screwball comedy and plenty of soul. With each beat exquisitely tied to Andersons techniques his zippy historical fairy tale (replete with hand-scrawled chapter headings) has a thoroughly immersive quality. The usual vibrant reds and blues (elegantly captured by cinematographer Robert Yeoman) mesh nicely with Alexandre Desplats jangly soundtrack. At once absurd and beautiful Andersons world has never been so spectacularly realized. Its also with a plot that splinters off in a handful of maze-like directions possibly the directors heaviest plot ever -- the point where it threatens to grow too dense for its own good during a hazy middle section. But the screenplay regains its footing through ample physical comedy starting with a prison escape sequence that suggests ""The Grand Illusion"" directed by Ernst Lubitsch. In the action-comedy phase of the story that follows Anderson gives us a riotous sled chase a clandestine gondola maneuver and allies to Gustaves cost that include both stone-faced monks as well as a superhero-like legion of supportive hotel concierges known as ""The Society of Crossed Keys"" -- providing yet another excuse for a few more staples of Andersons previous work to squeeze in cameos. The arrival of endless self-referential ingredients may test the patience of anyone unable to operate on Andersons zany wavelength but its hard not to fall for his hypnotic unapologetically silly riffs on romanticism and adventure. Despite the relentless charm factor Andersons whimsical expressivity is not devoid of greater significance. A comedic allegory for wartime relationships ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" explores the tragedies of socioeconomic collapse in the wake of Communist uprising and fascist threats without giving the conflicts a name. Gustaves conundrum embodies a dramatic tension involving the collapse of old world affluence and the regretful mindset that emerges from facing new generations his connection to Zero (initially harboring racist implications until the older man decides to take more of a paternal role) has plenty of symbolic ramifications worth sorting through. Gustaves peculiar nature is itself a wry caricature of European ideals in the first quarter of the twentieth century his flamboyance and sexual promiscuity at odds with his ostensibly conservative views on etiquette. A profound and ridiculous figure whose suave demeanor equally calls up memories of Oscar Wilde and Cary Grant Gustave embodies Andersons restless approach. For every moment that the capriciousness threatens to derail the narrative ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is sustained by an allegiance to that same outlandish imagination. The movie celebrates Andersons solipsistic artistry as a necessary factor in his success. Describing Gustave years later the older Zero says ""his world rushed by before he entered it but he sustained the illusion."" But its clear who hes really talking about. Likewise when Laws writer figure sets the scene in an opening description of the hotel he describes it as ""picturesque"" the ideal descriptor for any Anderson set. Then he adds ""I expect some of you will know it."" And we do yet it still manages to surprise us each time out. Criticwire Grade A- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Certain to receive strong word of mouth and hype ahead of its release the movie should receive a strong show of support when Fox Searchlight opens it in April. The early-in-the-year release date might make it a tough proposition to remain in the conversation during awards season but the movie should benefit from a less competitive marketplace and sustain a healthy box office office presence ahead of summer movie season.

Daily Edition Login to download The Grand Budapest Hotel Film Review 1200 PM PST 2/6/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An idiosyncratic period comedy that will delight connoisseurs more than the wide public. TWITTER Director Wes Anderson recruits a star-studded cast led by Ralph Fiennes for his ""Moonrise Kingdom"" follow-up. The game but losing battle waged by Old World grace and refinement against 20th century totalitarian thuggery is sympathetically portrayed by Wes Anderson via both arch and sophisticated farce in The Grand Budapest Hotel. With an attention to design detail that now has perhaps morphed from a preoccupation into a mania this is as densely aestheticized an experience as has come from a quasi-mainstream American filmmaker in many a moon. In a very appealing if outre way its sensibility and concerns are very much those of an earlier more elegant era meaning that the films deepest intentions will fly far over the heads of most modern filmgoers. Fox Searchlight can hope that the works boisterous sometimes bizarre humor as played by a colorful cast will be sufficient to attract a sizable slice of the audience that made Andersons last film Moonrise Kingdom his second-biggest hit. The elegant comedy had its world premiere as the opening night attraction at the Berlin Film Festival. As the critic Andrew Sarris once wrote of Ernst Lubitsch the all-time master of urbane naughty screen comedy ""For Lubitsch it was sufficient to say that Hitler had bad manners and no evil was then inconceivable."" Anderson adopts a very similar view here. While hardly closing his eyes to -- and in fact embracing -- the mischief vulgarity and even criminality in which people of all stripes can indulge he nonetheless takes to heart a time and place where a hierarchy of taste culture speech and overall refinement was paramount (and indeed Paramount in Lubitschs case). PHOTOS Wes Andersons Grand Budapest Hotel Meet Its 16 Characters But while the society may be high the comedy is low the talk vulgar. In a backwardly leap-frogging narrative that begins with an author-narrator (Tom Wilkinson) promising to relate the story ""exactly as it happened"" we are transported back to 1968 when the very same writer (Jude Law now) is invited to sup in the cavernous and nearly empty dining hall of a once-fashionable spa resort in the Republic of Zubrowka now reduced to communist-era inelegance. His host is the erstwhile owner Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) a stylish storyteller who in turn flips the calendar back to 1932 to relate how he came to the hotel and eventually into a fortune before soldiers and tyranny came crushing down upon the old way of life. From the first moment theres no mistaking who made this film. Constant lateral tracks push-ins whip-pans camera moves timed to dialogue title cards chapter headings miniatures use of stop-action fetishization of clothing and props absurdist predicaments -- all the techniques Anderson has honed over the years -- are used to pinpoint effect here. He even changes aspect ratio depending upon the era in which the action takes place; widescreen for 1968 the boxy 1.371 format for the 1930s and 1.851 for the later action. The effect is lively and expressive. At the center of Mr. Moustafas yarn is Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) the all-powerful concierge at the titular establishment during its glory years between the two world wars. Supremely efficient and privileged with many secrets Gustave runs the place like a martinet dresses behaves and speaks impeccably but incongruously uses expletives that startle coming from the mouth of such a proper chap. VIDEO New Grand Budapest Hotel Trailer Wes Andersons Cast Introduced Perhaps also contrary to recommended practice Gustave makes a point of bedding many of the female guests most notably the ancient and loaded Madame D. (a fabulously aged and bedecked Tilda Swinton) in whose fortune he wouldnt mind partaking once the grande dame takes her leave. Once she does all sorts of odious characters come out of the woodwork in a cutthroat race to claim her inheritance led by her fascistic son Dmitri (a threatening Adrien Brody) and his leather-jacketed enforcer Jopling (Willem Dafoe) each of whose fingers are memorably adorned by skull-shaped silver rings. The semi-absurdist competition for loot is festooned with baggage both personal and political while being played out in madcap style that involves Gustaves pursuit by a military police captain (Edward Norton) furtive train travel imprisonment an escape led by a bald tattooed convict (Harvey Keitel) an appeal to the nuttily preposterous Society of the Crossed Keys a secret organization of top European concierges led by Bill Murray and a crazy and delightfully unreal high-speed ski chase. Accompanying Gustave through all the zany mayhem is young Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) who is ostensibly undergoing his apprenticeship as a trainee lobby boy during this tumultuous period. A refugee from somewhere in the Middle East Zero proves himself a quick learner a resourceful partner and worthy protege for Gustave and ironically a non-European who better than anyone else in the later years embodies the old values in a so-called classless (and unclassy) new world that considers them best forgotten. Andersons style can as easily be praised for being formal rigorous and precise as it can be criticized for seeming artificial fastidious and fussy; especially here applied to a tale set in Ruritanian Europe of 80 years ago rather than the United States his approach may well seem off-putting and weird to the general public. But more discerning viewers will perhaps respond to the underlying air of melancholy and regret for the passing of a time marked by certain social niceties subtler sophistication in relations between the sexes and an appreciation for the art of living concerns the writer-director no doubt values in the work of the great Austrian writer of a century ago Stefan Zweig whose inspiration Anderson credits onscreen as a prime instigation for this project. Such an influence is a rare thing for a younger American filmmaker to fall under let alone make use of in his work and only a minority will respond to it. But its very much there. To this end Anderson who devised the story with Hugo Guinness is very well-served by his key collaborators most notably the wildly resourceful production designer Adam Stockhausen ever-inspired costume designer Milena Canonero cinematographer Robert Yeoman hair makeup and prosthetic designer Frances Hannon editor Barney Pilling and composer Alexandre Desplat whose energetic work meshes very effectively with swaths of classical and ethnic music. Led by the impeccable flamboyant and sometimes profane Fiennes the cast goes calculatedly over the top with aplomb; Abraham and Revolori supply civility while degrees of stylish nastiness are offered by Brody Dafoe and Norton. Saoirse Ronan portrays a young bakery apprentice whose large facial birthmark bears a striking resemblance to the map of Mexico.

The weather here may not be business as usual but the festival looks promising -- the competition includes films by Alain Resnais Lou Ye Yoji Yamada and Claudia Llosa (whose odd and rather wonderful picture The Milk of Sorrow won the top prize here the Golden Bear in 2009). But first things first The festival kicks off this evening with Wes Andersons Grand Budapest Hotel also in competition. It was screened for the press this afternoon but not at the Berlinale Palast the spacious and accommodating Potsdamer Platz venue where most of the big-ticket action takes place. It was shown instead in a smaller theater nearby which filled up quickly. The overflow was directed to a second theater in the same complex but before long we critics and journalists were nestled in comfortably like mice snuggled in cotton wool for an afternoon of Andersons follies. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Though I have tried many times over the years to like or even just appreciate Andersons films with the exception of the work-of-genius Fantastic Mr. Fox they elude me every time. The Grand Budapest Hotel strikes me as even less of a good thing although as its title suggests its Andersons most elaborate lavish-looking picture yet. The framing device for this marzipan monstrosity features an older writer from some fictitious Central European locale played by Tom Wilkinson reflecting on his younger days when he was Jude Law. It was 1968 and our writer friend was camping out at a formerly luxurious now down-at-the-heels hotel in the Republic of Zubrowka which was as a title card tells us in an emphatic parenthetical ""once the seat of an empire."" There he meets a mysterious older gent Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who may be the hotels owner. The two sit down to a lavish dinner in the hotel dining room a storybook stag mural looming nobly behind them. Mr. Moustafa unravels a woolly tale involving the finest concierge he ever knew a rather unapologetic gigolo by the name of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) who in more prosperous prewar days ran the hotel with the utmost in genteel efficiency. With his decorous bearing and penchant for ornate poetry Gustave also courted the favors of a number of rich dowagers among them Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) a wrinkled nervous wreck dressed in velvet robes straight out of Gustav Klimt.What happens as Anderson reveals through his static deadpan camera lens involves a priceless painting a protege and a stint in prison where a shirtless Harvey Keitel appears his sagging flesh adorned with tattoos so crude Lena Dunham might have sketched them. Never let it be said that Anderson skimps on the details. Theres more a sweet-natured baker whose cheek bears a birthmark in the shape of Mexico (Saoirse Ronan); the delightfully impish Mathieu Amalric in a thankless role as a loyal servant; and Adrien Brody who has stolen Jean Cocteaus hair to play Dmitri Madame D.s ungrateful evil son. Bill Murray Edward Norton Owen Wilson Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum all step forward to get a light dusting of Andersonia as well. Its all so tiny and adorable in its grandiose way. Anderson is occasionally capable of making me giggle -- Wilsons character is named M. Chuck which is just silly but I laughed. Plus Anderson is a master at casting just the right actor for each of these willfully absurd characters. (Fiennes seems to be having fun with his role -- its overstated curlicues are actually pretty subtle in his hands.) But why doesnt any of this glittering incident seem to matter? Its quite possible that fans of Anderson the corduroy visionary will love it. But The Grand Budapest Hotel brought out my inner Hunca Munca of Two Bad Mice fame This meticulously appointed dollhouse of a movie just went on and on making me want to smash many miniature plates of plaster food in frustration. I would apologize afterward of course because Im that kind of mouse. But not even the jaunty percussive score by Alexandre Desplat left a mark Too much of it sounds recycled from the truly great score Desplat wrote for Fantastic Mr. Fox. Once again Anderson has left me unmoved. If I werent in such a good mood and looking forward to the rest of what the Berlinale has to offer Id ask you to please pass me that diminutive plate of fake turkey so that I may dash it to the ground.

Its not until an hour or two has passed that you realize for all the wonderful flavors and beautiful plates that you havent really eaten anything. Its a film that could be called reactionary -- its a valentine to aristocratic pre-WWII Europe as seen through the eyes of a South Asian immigrant -- if Anderson werent such an aggressively apolitical filmmaker. His main agendas seem to be nostalgia and a dislike of authority (tempered by a love of mentors) and both are on full display here. We begin with a young woman in the modern day visiting the grave of a legendary writer then we cut to the writer (Tom Wilkinson) being interviewed in 1985 about his novel ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" a story he claims not to have invented but to have been told first-hand. This leads us to the 1968 flashback in which the writer (Jude Law) is staying at the titular eastern European establishment now a Soviet-era shadow of its once-grand self as a treatment for a strain of neurasthenia known as Scribes Fever. See video Wes Andersons The Grand Budapest Hotel Trailer Lets the Hijinks Fly Also staying there is legendary millionaire Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) who reportedly forfeited much of his fortune to the authorities in return for keeping the hotel. And over a long dinner in an empty dining room Mr. Moustafa tells the younger Brit his entire story In 1932 young Zero (Tony Revolori) was hired as Lobby Boy at the hotel which brought him under the direct tutelage of legendary concierge Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) a loving taskmaster who would become the boys mentor and friend. Gustave runs an exceedingly tight ship with one of his weaknesses (or strengths depending on how you look at it) being his endless affection for the rich elderly blonde female guests. One such conquest Madame D. (Tilda Swinton) passes away in her nearby villa leaving an invaluable painting to Gustave much to the chagrin of her nasty-tempered heir Dmitri (Adrien Brody). With the help of her butler Serge X. (Mathieu Amalric) Gustave and Zero spirit away the painting but since Madame D. was poisoned Dmitri -- with the help of his terrifying bodyguard Jopling (Willem Dafoe) -- frames Gustave for her murder. Also read Wes Andersons Grand Budapest Hotel to World Premiere at Berlin Film Festival Its a plot that accommodates a ski chase a prison break assistance from Gustaves fellow concierges in the Society of the Crossed Keys as well as Zeros budding romance with pastry chef Agatha (Saoirse Ronan). And all along in the background we see the subtle wearing away of a society that could maintain something as gloriously excessive as the Grand Budapest Hotel as the clouds of war gather in the distance. Anderson shoots all of this with gusto and as ever his crew -- particularly the art directors and set designers cinematographer Robert Yeoman and composer Alexandre Desplat -- are as much the stars of the film as the actors and they contribute as much wit as Anderson and Hugo Guinness screenplay. The Grand Budapest Hotel itself is perhaps Andersons biggest and most elaborate toybox to date and Yeomans camera zips and climbs and turns around every corner. You can sense Andersons delight in creating this pink bauble of a 1930s luxury spa and then turning it into a drab Eastern bloc facility laden with instructional signs and molded orange naugahyde lounge chairs. Watching ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is the kind of wonderfully delirious experience that feels plugged directly into the cerebral cortex of anyone who loves the movies. Theres always some new delight whether its a set piece to look at or a balalaika composition to listen to or a performance to savor. (Fiennes and Revolori make a great comic duo but theres not a bum note from this large and talented ensemble which also includes Bill Murray Edward Norton Lea Seydoux Harvey Keitel and Jeff Goldblum.)

Gustave is a hilarious creation both dandified and endlessly resourceful but even though Fiennes makes him a treat to watch hes too much of a capital-c Character to make the center of this universe. Seeing ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was one of the most exciting film-watching experiences Ive had in months; I just wish remembering it later carried the same resonance. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
