Credit Matt Nettheim/Magnolia Pictures ""The Hunter"" filmed in Tasmania has the faintly surreal look peculiar to Australian movies in which nature pulses with a mysterious primordial shimmer. Adapted from Julia Leighs novel and directed by Daniel Nettheim from a screenplay by Alice Addison the film tells the story of a lone hunter from another continent searching for a creature that may not exist in an old-growth forest largely untouched by humans.There are moments as the hunter wanders through the wilderness when you wonder if a dinosaur might appear.His elusive prey is the Tasmanian tiger a predator that is thought to have been extinct since 1936 when the last specimen died in captivity. Vintage footage of the creature with its striped fur and doglike face is seen early in the movie.If the Tasmanian tiger is a ready-made symbol that invites all sorts of grandiose interpretation ""The Hunter"" admirably refrains from pushing its implications to the forefront. They are embedded in the story and in the cinematography of Robert Humphreys whose sweeping depictions of the highlands where the hunter Martin (Willem Dafoe) ventures appear prehistoric and forbidding.Prehistoric might also describe the cavernous face of Mr. Dafoe now 56. Its crags angles and lines constitute a virtual contour map and metaphorical mirror image of the rugged mountain territory he enters equipped with telescopic rifles and elaborate traps. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the same time there is something soft about Mr. Dafoes screen persona not soft as in weak but in his essential kindness and openness of spirit. Even in the toughest most macho roles Mr. Dafoe who once played Jesus retains a tinge of Christ-like sweetness and vulnerability.Martin is no goody-goody. A freelance mercenary he is dispatched by a military biotech company called Red Leaf to fly from Paris to Hobart Australia on a secret mission to find a Tasmanian tiger after rumors of sightings. His mission is to trap the beast and retrieve samples of skin blood and organs so that the company can harvest its DNA and develop the anesthetic secreted by the tiger to immobilize its prey. Video Willem Dafoe on The Hunter At South by Southwest the actor discusses his role as a mercenary on the hunt for the last Tasmanian tiger. By Mekado Murphy on Publish Date March 14 2012. . Watch in Times Video >> embed An enigmatic local resident named Jack (Sam Neill) has arranged for Martin to stay with an eco-activist Jarrah who is not at home when Martin arrives at his remote mountain cabin. The generator there is broken leaving Jarrahs family with no electricity or hot water.Jarrah Martin learns has been missing for a year and his wife Lucy (Frances OConnor) fortified by sleeping pills and tranquilizers has withdrawn into a stupor letting their two children Sass (Morgana Davies) and her younger brother Bike (Finn Woodlock) run wild. The daughter is outgoing and profane; the son silent with expressive eyes. He and Martin develop a deep unspoken connection.In the storys weakest thread Martin rouses Lucy out of her depression in almost no time and the four become a family of sorts. If ""The Hunter"" were a product of Hollywood the two would become romantically involved. But the movie resists pushing the usual buttons.Trouble greets Martin the moment he sets foot in a bar where loggers congregate. Because of where he is staying he is presumed to be a tree-hugging ""greenie"" intent on destroying their livelihood. And his cover story -- that he is from a university conducting a study of the raccoonlike Tasmanian devil -- doesnt wash. Tense standoffs between Martin and the loggers who pay an unannounced visit to Lucys house one evening are charged with menace. It is strongly suggested that they may have killed Jarrah.The movie minimizes the books comparisons of Martin to the feral animal he is stalking. Although Mr. Dafoes Martin is a credible frontiersman the hunter-prey contest is insignificant compared with the films allegorical contemplation of opposing forces the promises and illusions of technology survival versus conservation the meaning of extinction in the age of cloning and ultimately the mystery of the past versus the uncertainty of the future.As the story develops Martin is increasingly humanized by his experience. But he doesnt turn into a bleeding heart.""The Hunter"" never declares who is good or bad or right or wrong. And the implications of Martins decision when the moment of truth finally arrives are left for the viewer to unravel.

While all life forms are related in the broadest sense the Tasmanian tiger which is believed to be extinct was a marsupial and thus not ""a relative of the wolf.""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its possible to think of The Hunter as a thriller diluted by atmosphere or a mood piece disrupted by plot but for much of the films length director Daniel Nettheim successfully pitches camp in the razor-thin overlap between the two. Willem Dafoe who brings brooding storm clouds with him wherever he goes plays a hazily defined mercenary who takes on a pharmaceutical companys assignment to hunt down the purportedly extinct Tasmanian tiger. That naturally means heading to Tasmania whose untouched terrain proves more hospitable than some of the locals. Badly (and somewhat implausibly given his profession) fumbling his first encounter with a handful of outlander-hating rednecks Dafoes ""greenie"" becomes the target of periodic unpredictable harassment which is mostly harmless but suggests the potential for something far more threatening. As Dafoe mounts his excursions into the wilderness searching for any sign of his inconceivably rare prey The Hunter cuts loose from its plot which is all to the good. The movies most engrossing sequences are wordless and often near-silent simply Dafoe negotiating his environment making traps from wound wire and bent branches and gutting the small animals he catches for further study. The interactions are also terse at his temporary home base a rented room in the house of a family whose patriarch disappeared some months before. Mom Frances OConnor emerges from her bedroom only briefly leaving Dafoe to converse with her mute son. Whether the boys inability to speak is congenital or a response to his fathers absence is never explained because his place is almost purely archetypal. Its tempting to trace the movies problems back to the source novel by Julia Leigh whose 2011 film Sleeping Beauty shows a fatal weakness for undigested symbolism especially once the exigencies of drama take hold in the home stretch. When nothings happening The Hunter is engrossing. Dafoe invests every action with a sense of purpose (not thankfully the same thing as meaning) to the extent that viewers would likely turn up to watch him peel potatoes Jeanne Dielman-style. But the movie fumbles badly when its time to turn those actions toward resolution forcing an ending that seems both arbitrary and cruel. At under 80 minutes the movie is terse enough that it could do without trumped-up events.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet From the moment The Hunters colorful rock-n-roll-stoked opening credits fill the screen its clear that writer-director Rafi Pitts is attempting something a little different from the usual restrained Iranian neo-realism. The Hunter is as deliberate as any other Iranian art-film building its story incident by incident quietly following an ex-con (played by Pitts) as he learns that his wife has been killed and his daughter has gone missing in the wake of an election protest. But the movie is frequently bathed in halogen glow and deep shadow at times looking like Taxi Driver as Pitts drives forlornly from his home to his job as a factory night watchman--a job that keeps him away from his family more than hed like. After Pitt gets the news about his wife and daughter he flips out and goes on a shooting spree before retreating into the woods pursued by two bickering policemen. And though The Hunter maintains the same even tone after it turns into a chase thriller the look begins to resemble the work of William Friedkin and Walter Hill in its clean elemental approach to action. The Hunter is way too heavy-handed at times about depicting its protagonists sense of loss and even with the expressionistic touches and brisk editing the plot bubbles along a little too slowly for a potboiler. But the film is stunningly composed with images that convey Pitts sense of being ground down by modernity and beset by institutional hypocrisy. Throughout The Hunter sprinkles in footage of car washes and factories--facilities where the processes have been automated removing the human element--along with scenes set in the hazy outdoors where its hard to tell whos on whose side or why. Theres nothing overtly political about The Hunter but its no accident that its set against the backdrop of The Green Revolution or that the heros frustration is born of bureaucratic indifference along with a sense that long before he lost his family the system was conspiring to keep him lonely.

Willem Dafoe does damage in The Hunter.Magnolia Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Drawing baths and listening to classical music refined soldier of fortune Martin (Willem Dafoe) is sent Down Under by a military-biotech firm that wants him to bring back a Tasmanian tiger. Although the crocodile-jawed creature was declared extinct in the 1930s sightings have been reported and the company wishes to exploit the animals toxin. For his mission Martin pretends to be a university wildlife researcher bunking in an off-road shack with two kids--the potty-mouthed Sass (Morgana Davies) and her mute little brother (Finn Woodlock)--and their mother Lucy (Frances OConnor) doped up on Lexapro and other dolls for The Hunters first half. Based on the 1999 novel by Julia Leigh (the writer-helmer of last years maddeningly opaque Sleeping Beauty) and directed by Australian TV vet Daniel Nettheim The Hunter is too many films in one a man-against-nature thriller; a mystery involving the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Lucys naturalist husband despised by the local loggers; a family drama centering on a loners transformation to protective paternal figure. The graceful force amid all this unconvincing bustle and distracting plot buildup is Dafoe present in every scene. But it is only when Martin waits alone for his prey in the Tasmanian woods that were happy to pass the time with him.

It was a good decision Pitts gives a striking performance as Ali an ex-con battling the bureaucracy of Irans repressive society. At first Alis bothered by minor problems like getting stuck on the night shift at the factory where hes a security guard. But soon matters take a more serious turn When his wife and 6-year-old daughter dont come home one afternoon Alis subjected to humiliating treatment by the police before he learns they were killed in a shootout between cops and ""insurgents."" You can understand why the taciturn Ali lashes out in an unexpected way. Cinematographer Mohammad Davudis nighttime shots of jammed Tehran highways help convey the societys dehumanization. Scenes of a vast forest outside the city where Ali releases tension by hunting are powerful in their own sparse way. ""The Hunter could do with more of a back story. Why for example was Ali in prison? And was his wife a protester or just a woman who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time? But these are minor questions in light of the films overall potency. ""The Hunter would make a fine fit in a double-feature with the Iranian movie ""A Separation which opened here last week and explores similar issues.

A mercenary searching for the extinct Tasmanian Tiger has his suppressed humanity stirred in uneven Aussie psychological drama-cum environmental thriller ""The Hunter."" Beautifully lensed and impeccably performed by topliner Willem Dafoe debut helmer Daniel Nettheims adaptation of the novel by author-filmmaker Julia Leigh (""Sleeping Beauty"") maintains an intriguing ambience but general auds may feel theyre not given enough information about the protag to become fully immersed in his journey toward redemption. Opening domestically Oct. 6 following its Toronto world preem pics name cast should help snare respectable biz locally and in selected offshore markets. The overarching plot is a real grabber A soldier of fortune (Dafoe) is recruited in Paris by a middleman (Jacek Koman) representing a shady biotech company to secure potentially priceless DNA from a Tasmanian Tiger. (The Tiger -- the ""dog with a wolfs head"" -- has long captured the public imagination Down Under with rumors of its survival since the last specimen died in captivity in 1936 and the species was officially declared extinct in 1986.) Assuming the name Martin David and the persona of a university researcher studying the common Tasmanian Devil David is met in a remote part of the island state by Jack Mindy (Sam Neill) a local guide who arranges lodging for the visitor at the run-down house of Lucy Armstrong (Frances OConnor). In the first third of the film the interests of Lucy left virtually comatose by the sedatives shes taken in the many months since her zoologist husband disappeared in the bush are related by her daughter Sass (Morgana Davies) a sparky tween with a strikingly adult vocabulary and her shy younger brother Bike (Finn Woodlock). But as the film progresses Davids lonely mysterious excursions into the wilderness for what local legend suggests is the last surviving tiger are punctuated by meetings with a now sedative-free Lucy with whom he establishes a bond. And his father-like connection with the children helps him pick up a crucial lead to the tiger. The fate of Lucys husband and a background confrontation between environmental activists and loggers add a slow-burning suspense to the mix but the storys primary aim of getting auds to empathize with Davids transformation from an emotional blank to a man with genuine feelings is undercut by the narrow perimeters drawn around him. Though hardly providing a detailed profile of the central character Leighs 1999 novel offered enriching snapshots of his difficult childhood lack of meaningful relationships and his experiences as a hired hand in military operations. Dafoes perf as the lone wolf is spot-on but the absence of any such backgrounding leaves auds to only imagine what has brought him to this personal crossroads. Assisted by an engaging turn from Neill as the friendly local with something to hide and OConnors punchy role as a distressed wife and mother with more to fear than she might dare imagine Nettheims carefully considered direction successfully molds Davids hunt for the elusive tiger into a metaphor for the insecurities of the main players. Widescreen lensing by Robert Humphreys boldly contrasts staggeringly beautiful landscapes with moody interiors reflecting the characters fears. Subtle music and haunting slivers of ambient sound by Matteo Zingales Michael Lira and Andrew Lancaster contribute mightily to the mythical aura surrounding Davids prey. The rest of the tech work is first-class.

After losing his family during the run-up to Irans disputed 2009 elections a Tehrani man snaps and turns sniper in ""The Hunter"" the low-key fifth feature from Iranian helmer Rafi Pitts (""Its Winter""). With its stripped-down narrative left purposefully oblique the indirect storytelling allows different readings Some may find it a political statement of sorts while others dismiss it as irritatingly obscure and uninvolving. Boasting expressive landscapes and a strong visceral sound design the downbeat pic is specialty fare with limited appeal outside the fest circuit. Ex-con Ali (director Pitts giving a numb performance in which he barely speaks) lives in Tehran so noisy and full of nerve-jangling traffic that it resembles L.A. at rush hour. He shares a tiny apartment in a high-rise overlooking the highway with wife Sara (Mitra Hajjar) and 6-year-old daughter Saba (Saba Yaghoobi). From time to time hes shown hunting in quiet snowy hills far from the city. One night Sara and Saba fail to return home. After a frustrating wait at the police station Ali learns that Saras been killed in crossfire between police and protestors. After it seems that his daughter died too Ali takes his high-powered scope rifle and shoots two policemen. As the action moves along with the fleeing Ali from an urban landscape of concrete and expressways to the hinterlands misty forests the attenuated second half often feels like a completely different film. Here the focus falls on a pair of feuding policemen who take him captive leading to depending on how one reads it an ironic or cynical ending. Just as Shirin Neshats recent ""Women Without Men"" gained resonance from the massive protests following Iranian President Ahmadinejads re-election so too does ""Hunter"" seem to echo the current political opposition zeitgeist in spite of the fact that it was shot during the election campaign. Someone somewhere is sure to draw a parallel between the death of Sara and that of Neda Agha-Soltan in protests in Iran last June or link Alis green car and green apartment walls with Irans Green Revolution. However whats more of a political statement -- yet still open to interpretation -- is the first shot of the opening-credits sequence (accompanied by loud heavy-metal music). Here the camera gradually pulls back to reveal a photo of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps circa 1980 about to drive their motorcycles over a giant replica of the American flag. Apart from sweet-faced Hajjar who doesnt get much screen time as Sara the cast is entirely nonpro. The stressed-looking Pitts was forced to take on the main role when his leading actor proved unreliable; art director Malak Khazai Pitts real mother plays Alis mother. As in ""Its Winter"" ace lenser Mohammad Davoodi provides stunning long shots locating small human figures in powerful landscapes that seem to overwhelm them while poetic cutting by Pitts regular editor Hassan Hassandoost sets the emotional temperature.

By David Denby Edward Norton playing a double role as twin brothers with Richard Dreyfuss.   Credit Illustration by Victor Melamed Edward Norton is a good actor and a busy man--a citizen who concerns himself with solar energy affordable housing the Maasai wilderness peace in the Middle East the High Line the fate of the Mets outfield and heaven knows what else. But hes not quite a movie star or the actor he could be. Early on after a fast Oscar-nominated start as an altar boy accused of murdering a priest in ""Primal Fear"" (1996) Norton played cunning lowlifes in tough little pictures. He was brilliant as Lester (Worm) Murphy a reckless gambler and nihilist in ""Rounders"" (1998) and then muscling up he turned Derek Vinyard the swastikaed skinhead in ""American History X"" (also 1998) into a horrifyingly intelligent native fascist. Norton has blue eyes a long narrow chin and an ironic smile that can suddenly turn intimate. He can be retiring and nearly bodiless falling back from confrontation like a ghost; he can also be menacing and cold hardening his baritone into a snarl. Like James Woods in films thirty years ago he appears to think that hes the smartest person in the room and like Woods he uses that arrogance as a way of exposing the madness of egotistical characters. At the moment movies could use more men like Norton--actors who can spread a little acid or a little light. If such high-domed performers develop an ingratiating way with women they become stars like George Clooney; if not they usually subside into character roles like Woods or Alec Baldwin. Its not easy to be the smartest guy in the room. Norton I think has the charm the courage and the dimensions to take on great parts but his career has wandered around in roles that have been off center without being good. He stood up to Brad Pitts bullying in the nutty cult classic ""Fight Club"" (1999). He was the scientist with anger-management issues in ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008) the kind of popping-veins extravaganza every actor should gratefully leave to Jim Carrey. He was swanky in cravats high collars and an Anglo-Austrian accent in that thick wedge of Hapsburg cheesecake ""The Illusionist"" (2006). The accent got even more pinched and refined when he played a British doctor suppressing his personal sorrows and martyring himself to Chinese epidemics in ""The Painted Veil"" (2006) a frightfully noble picture that could have been made by M-G-M in 1940. These are not the best choices for an actor with an instinct for contemporary life. Action is apparently not to Nortons taste but hes a natural for calculating power types and intellectuals--gangsters lawyers politicians journalists corporate and financial operators. He needs to find writers who will create roles for him as intelligent troubled men as Clooney has. In ""Leaves of Grass"" Norton gets a real workout in a goosey half-serious half-comical mess. Hes Bill Kincaid a mesmerizing classical-philosophy professor at Brown. Hes also Bills identical twin Brady an Oklahoma pot grower with truck-stop manners and a peculiar drawl (peculiar because it runs at double tempo). Brady is everything that Bill left behind in his ascent to the Ivy League. Citing Socrates Bill tells his class that the Greeks knew that passion was ""mercilessly human"" that a serene life was an illusion. Yet hes a becalmed man himself--another asexual dried-up movie professor without a touch of spontaneity. As he considers an offer from Harvard (the film drops all the right names) he hears that Brady has been killed. This is a ruse it turns out to lure him back to Oklahoma where he gets pulled into his brothers convoluted plot to take on the drug kingpin of the Southwest (Richard Dreyfuss). As Bill Norton wears his hair short his sweaters sleeveless and his slacks gray; his style is academic casual. When he plays Brady his hair is long and stringy; hes loose-limbed and slack-jawed and he cant stop chattering. The surprise of the movie is that Brady the pot grower is just as smart as Bill the professor and a lot happier. He cultivates dope in mineral-water solutions--hes a hydroponic felon--and his weed packs a wallop. Norton gives himself to this reprobate without condescension. He turns Brady into a warmhearted enraging but lovable screwup. Norton has played double before--the nice boy in ""Primal Fear"" had a vicious side--but never in such a literal way. To adopt the movies classical terminology the Apollonian and the Dionysian temperaments are digitally joined in an agon. Tim Blake Nelson who wrote and directed ""Leaves of Grass"" combines the two Nortons in ways that look natural enough. They argue talking over each others words horse around and fight. The movie is a showcase for digital technology and for Nortons virtuosity but I wish it werent such a weightless shambles. Nelson cant seem to find the right tone; he veers from backwoods comedy to nervously unhinged violence to earnest talk of poetry and the meaning of life. Born Jewish in Tulsa (his maternal grandparents escaped the Nazis) Nelson has some heavy fun with his community. He makes Dreyfusss drug lord (who fronts as a businessman) a fierce Jewish supporter of Israel--his office walls are lined with pictures of Menachem Begin and other Israeli leaders. And Nelson throws in a foolish Jewish orthodontist (Josh Pais) who tries to blackmail both brothers and accidentally kills someone. Theres no reason that Jews shouldnt be treated as comically as anyone else in the movies but the scenes are so crudely directed that theyre more embarrassing than funny. Recitations of Walt Whitman and a few encounters with a lovely teacher and poet (Keri Russell) begin to quicken the professor but the movie for all its high-culture flourishes feels stale. The mix of cornpone shenanigans and intellectualism lands Nelson in Coen Brothers territory and I never thought that Id miss their brutally mocking tone so much. Edward Norton needs to put himself not only in the hands of a good writer but of a good director too. After brilliant early performances as a sardonic tough in ""8 Million Ways to Die"" (1986) and ""Godfather III"" (1990) Andy Garcia also ran into the rough. ""City Island"" an amiable family comedy one step above a TV sitcom (and several steps below ""Moonstruck"") wont put him back on the main road but he tries some new things in it and its fun to watch him work. Garcia is Vince Rizzo the stressed paterfamilias of an Italian-American clan living in the Bronx boating community a family in which everyone has a secret and mistrusts everyone else. (The story is kept going by the inability of any character to say even six words of truth in a row.) Vince is a prison guard whose secret is that he wants to perform at night he sneaks off to an acting class. In one scene the instructor played by Alan Arkin delivers a hilarious diatribe against ""the pause""--the endlessly prolonged reflective grimace that Marlon Brando introduced into American acting. Speak or listen the teacher says. Dont pause. The familys screaming fights may be glibly contrived (no pausing there) but the miseries of an aspiring actors life feel genuine. Vince auditions for a Scorsese movie and as he is interviewed by a female casting director perched on a platform he painfully casts away every acting mannerism until he speaks in his own voice. Vince comes to life and for that moment Garcia regains the energy he had as a young actor. If Norton and Garcia are good actors whose careers got lost Gerard Butler (""300"") is a brutish actor whose career should be confined to playing sword-bearing Spartans and perhaps wrestlers in the netherworld of cable. I want to meet the agent who sold Butler to the studios as a romantic-comedy star. (He was also in ""The Ugly Truth."") In ""The Bounty Hunter"" Butlers dark hair droops over his forehead and he looks like a cross between Cro-Magnon man and Moe from the Three Stooges. Butler is Scottish and you can see him trying to form American-sounding phrases with his lips but the voice comes out coarse-grained and weirdly nondescript as if produced by a badly programmed computer. His bounty hunter once a great cop takes on the job of reeling in his ex-wife a hustling New York crime reporter on the lam played by Jennifer Aniston in heels and skintight dresses. The queen of all celebrity magazines is still adorable and she has just enough technique--a mouth twisted in disbelief a furrowed brow--to get by as a comedienne. The movie is an example of the once sublime genre known as ""the comedy of re-marriage."" That is as the couple are tearing each other apart were meant to root for them to get back together. The only thing that Butler and Aniston have in common however is identical Aruba-bronze skin tones they seem to have been sprayed with the same can. Even considered as no more than an assembly-line Hollywood product ""The Bounty Hunter"" falls well below factory standards.

Butler plays Milo Boyd an ex-cop turned bail bondsman assigned to haul in his ex-wife Nicole (Jennifer Aniston) a hotshot reporter in deep with the law. The pursuit takes this pair of bickering exes from New York to Atlantic City and back via a series of perfunctory car chases poorly choreographed punch-ups and excruciating romantic entanglements.The trouble is not so much that Butler isnt funny - he isnt even slightly - but that he sucks the merest hint of humour from the entire enterprise. Even proven performers like Aniston and Christine Baranski as a sexually voracious mother-in-law are reduced to desperate mugging and hysterical arm-waving in an attempt to fill the comic vacuum which their muscular co-star leaves in his wake. To be fair the script gives them little to work with there are maybe three decent laughs interspersed with long stretches of  interminable would-be witty banter and one near-unwatchable comedy torture scene. The score too is atrocious infuriatingly cheeky in the comedy scenes switching to screeching Bon Jovi-esque AOR whenever things kick off. The Bounty Hunter isnt bad enough to be offensive its simply lazy trite smug irritating and a colossal waste of time talent and money. Therell be worse films released in 2010 - but not many.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 19 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Mar. 18 2010 751PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Bounty Hunter Directed by Andy Tennant Written by Sarah Thorp Starring Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston Classification PG You would have to be pathologically fascinated with celebrity gossip to find any compensation in The Bounty Hunter a painfully contrived romantic comedy/thriller that may (or may not) have brought Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston together as a real-life couple. The story of a bail enforcer who captures his newspaper-reporter ex-wife manages to be both formulaic and patchwork with whatever twinkles that exist between the stars eclipsed by the overall crudeness. The plot is distantly descended from a favourite rom-com template the 1940 Howard Hawkes classic His Girl Friday That is its a remarriage comedy with connections to the newspaper business and crime. Unfortunately it has more similarities to director Andy Tennants equally grating 2008 film Fools Gold with Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson. Butler the Scottish hunk who has been ambitiously pursuing a double-track romantic and action-star career in the past couple of years plays essentially the same character as he played in The Ugly Truth with Katherine Heigl. Hes the caveman slob who likes booze and meat and shows women whos boss by throwing them over his shoulder. Milo a former New York police detective who fell apart after his marriage ended works as a bail-enforcement agent nabbing people who fail to make court appearances and tries to avoid his bookie to whom hes in substantial debt. When the name of his former wife Nicole a hotshot journalist pops up in a file hes delighted with the opportunity to get her in handcuffs and take her to jail. Nicole who totters around the newsroom in high heels and distinctly unconventional reporter garb (a peek-a-boo blouse and derriere-clinging skirt) is a career-obsessed gal too busy for love. Shes skipped a court appearance because shes hot on the trail of a story involving a suspicious suicide and possible police-corruption scandal. Hot on her trail in turn is Nicoles doofus colleague ( Saturday Night Lives Jason Sudeikis) whos convinced shes in love with him. Milo tracks Nicole down in Atlantic City where amidst visits to the gambling tables misadventures involving bags of money strippers and revisiting old lovers haunts the couple squabble and bond. No explanation is offered as to why they ever split up or why they would want to be together. Butler forcing his American accent leers and makes puppy eyes and feels blatantly inauthentic. Aniston while being handcuffed and physically abused delivers brittle one-liners harrumphs in frustration or resorts to nose-crinkling cuteness. Brief appearances from Jeff Garlin as Milos employer Christine Baranski as Nicoles flamboyant mother and Cathy Moriarity as a mob boss dont make this any funnier. The half-baked subplot involving bad cops mobsters and a lot of car chases adds running time but no adrenalin. Too bad someone didnt catch this one before it escaped to the theatres.

Much of the films visual impact rests on those two prominently featured limbs and their surrounding real estate which male characters ogle like slobbering cartoons out ofMad Magazine. As for Anistons hunkamunka co-star Gerard Butler gets his money shot when he emerges wet from the shower. Cue wolf whistle from the crowd. I would like to say The Bounty Hunter is just as efficient arousing laughter but Andy Tennants (Fools Gold) by-the-book battle-of-the-exes romantic comedy works overtime for just a handful of chuckles and a few big yucks. If youve watched the trailer youve seen them all. The Butler-in-handcuffs moment. The Aniston-in-handcuffs moment. The Butler-tackling-Aniston moment. The Aniston-tasering-Butler moment. Youre also well-acquainted with the plot which follows scathing ex-marrieds Milo (Butler) and Nicole (Aniston) on a series of contrived misadventures after Nicole misses a court date on an assault charge. Milo the bounty hunter gets hired to haul in Nicole the bail skipper and a tough-chick reporter for the New York Daily News. ""This baby is karma"" he crows a nasty spousal gleam in his eye. It isnt long before Milo tracks her down at a racetrack in New Jersey but nothing is ever that simple is it? First he must lock her in the trunk. Then she must bribe him into playing craps for the night in Atlantic City where the movie parks for a spell while a large cast of supporting eccentrics foozle around in pursuit. Sarah Thorps busy screenplay includes among other things a nervous snitch (Adam Rose) bumbling bookies (Joel Marsh Garland Ritchie Coster) their big blond boss-lady (Cathy Moriarty) and a clammy-looking tattoo artist (Peter Greene) involved in a suspicious death. In addition Nicole is stalked by an obsessive nebbish in a lavender sweater (Jason Sudeikis) who has a sorry run-in with a veterinarian and drops out of the plot halfway through. The film is stuffed with these idiosyncratic micro-roles (I loved Siobhan Fallon Hogan as the bondsmans secretary) which prove more diverting than the two main characters. Nicole and Milo fight like crazy a strong indication in movieland that they actually have the hots for one another. But the venomous shtick gets old fast especially when it alternates with mush-mouthed romantic truisms. Im fond of Aniston who still seems like someone Id bump into at a Starbucks condiment bar. And I nurse a soft spot for Butler hoping against hope that hell ditch the toxic posturing of Law Abiding Citizen and The Ugly Truth for the chesty heroism of 300 -- or the warmth he threw off in Dear Frankie. Im also rooting for a re-emergence of that marvelous Scottish burr. His American accent is getting better but it doesnt really suit him; he spits out the phonemes like olive pits. He should spit out his last few movies too. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off Banana Republic Final Cut Sale Up to 75% off + free shipping...

Save for later Saved The Bounty Hunter has Gerard Butler in the title role trying to haul in his ex-wife in this slow-moving action/romantic comedy. By Andy Klein Film critic March 19 2010 Save for later Saved Jennifer Aniston left and Gerard Butler are shown in a scene from the action comedy The Bounty Hunter. Barry Wetcher/Columbia Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The premise of ""The Bounty Hunter"" an action/romantic comedy from director Andy Tennant (""Hitch"") is a perfectly legitimate variation on Capras ""It Happened One Night."" More than a year after an acrimonious divorce cop-turned-bounty-hunter Milo Boyd (Gerard Butler) gets the dream assignment - bringing in his ex-wife investigative reporter Nicole Hurley (Jennifer Aniston) who has missed a court date.Gosh will they fight like cats and dogs? Will they have to team up to elude two different groups of bad guys? Will their forced intimacy make them realize that they really do belong together? Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Well duh. The sheer predictability isnt the problem; I wouldnt have the plot play out any other way. Its everything else thats the problem. At points the film sinks below the level of competent A stupid plot trick early on is so badly edited that it takes another minute to figure out whats supposed to be going on. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The pacing - both overall and within scenes - is so slack that even the irresistible Aniston and some usually reliable character players cant liven things up. Butler exceeds expectations simply by virtue of not yelling ""This is Sparta"" every 20 seconds.

"The Bounty Hunter Aniston Gerard Butler strike no sparks | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Bounty Hunter Aniston Gerard Butler strike no sparksFor reasons that are of absolutely no benefit to The Bounty Hunter  a witless waste of celluloid it kept making me think of Frank Capras It Happened One Night .Jennifer Aniston right and Gerard Butler show little chemistry despite rumours of an off-screen romance.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 19 2010 (out of four)Starring Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler. Directed by Andy Tennant. At major theatres. PGFor reasons that are of absolutely no benefit to The Bounty Hunter a witless waste of celluloid it kept making me think of Frank Capras It Happened One Night.The 1932 film starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is the gold standard for comedies about squawking lovebirds and its certain that Bounty Hunter director Andy Tennant and screenwriter Sarah Thorp have seen it. What they didnt do is learn from it.Article Continued BelowConsider a scene ripped from Capra in which ex-spouses Milo Boyd (Gerard Butler) and Nicole Hurley (Jennifer Aniston) on the lam from guys with guns find themselves obliged to share a bedroom. Rather than sort things out between themselves as Gable and Colbert did so amusingly Milo and Nicole call other people on their cellphones the bane of modern movies. Milo a former cop turned bounty hunter gets desultory love advice from the wife of his bail-bond employer. Nicole a newspaper reporter hunted by Milo for ridiculously contrived reasons moans to her randy mom (Christine Baranski) who asks her to take a cellphone photo of Milos bare bum.Such is the sad state of screenwriting today that this passes for amusing banter in romantic comedies. Not a word of The Bounty Hunter feels as though it passed through a mind or heart prior to being slammed onto a page. Its obvious no real-world newsroom research went into penning Nicoles reporter gig shes given limitless time by an unseen editor to chase a story with no apparent news angle to it.Nothing is in real jeopardy or ever in doubt here. There are two parallel stories Milos and Nicoles on-again off-again relationship and those guys with guns who keep shooting at them. We know exactly how the first one is going to end and we dont care about the second.And why should we? We are given no reasons either to wonder or fret. Milo and Nicole keep arguing (and arguing) even as theyre being shot at by a thug from a passing vehicle. The bullets magically avoid them and the bad guy also benefits from supernatural protection. His SUV rolls violently off the road and flips over yet he gets away with barely a scratch.Rumour (and tabloid reports) insist that Aniston and Butler became a romantic couple while making this movie. This is hard to fathom since they exhibit no onscreen sparks. They both try hard and Butler had recent experience playing a similar role in last summers The Ugly Truth. But theyre working with material that should have been shown a paper shredder rather than the green light. The plot is so lazy it simply forgets about Nicoles love struck co-worker played by Jason Sudeikis who is introduced early on as comic relief. Hes then abandoned for most of the rest of the film - and its not like the movie couldnt use more comedy.The musical cues are equally throwaway. A chase scene on a golf course is set to the Bee Gees disco hit ""Stayin Alive"" for no good reason. Yet another chase scene gets the Rolling Stones ""Hang Fire"" which is a song inspired by Margaret Thatchers tough economic policies of the 1980s. Did anyone actually listen to the lyrics?But listening and thinking are obviously not a priority for helmer Tennant who also made Fools Gold another lame rom-com about quarrelling cupids. Perhaps its time for him to consider other employment - bounty hunting maybe?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Hunter The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hunter-the ) Hunter The (Australia 2011) April 13 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli In recent years as cloning has become more readily accepted in popular and scientific circles proposals (some more fantastical than others) have been suggested about how to return extinct species to the planet. Some like using the DNA of a preserved woolly mammoth carcass may be viable. Others like the Jurassic Park approach of reaching back millions of years for dinosaur genetic material remains in the realm of fiction. What is not disputed however is that if the resurrection of extinct animals crossed the line between potential and reality it would be big business. That recognition lies at the heart of The Hunter an uneven but sometimes compelling tale of a big game hunter sent to Tasmania to find the last member of the so-called ""Tasmanian tiger"" species kill it and bring back its DNA. That would give a corporation sole rights to the species when they reconstitute it in their facilities. The Tasmanian tiger is not actually a tiger; it is a carnivorous marsupial with a striped back. By the beginning of the 20th century it was extinct on the Australian mainland but still existed in small numbers on the island of Tasmania. The last confirmed sighting in the wild was in the early 1930s; the last captive Tasmanian tiger died in 1936. (Surviving black-and-white footage of this tiger in a zoo is used in the movie.) Although the species has been officially declared to be extinct there have been numerous sightings over the years although none confirmed. The Hunter postulates that there is a single surviving specimen in the wild and corporations will pay big money and go to extraordinary lengths to gain possession of its DNA. Willem Dafoe is Martin David a professional hunter working for a biotech company who comes to Australia pretending to be a ""university scientist."" He stays with a local family in between making trips into the wilderness searching for the elusive tiger. He is aided and sometimes hindered by local Jack Mindy (Sam Neill) and runs afoul of loggers who mistakenly believe him to be an environmentalist endangering their livelihood. His footsteps are also dogged by a rival hunter who is on the same quest although its unclear whether the other man is a backup sent by Davids company or someone working freelance or for another corporation. The most interesting aspect of The Hunter relates to Davids tracking of the tiger. He uses a variety of mostly lethal traps and snares as well as surveillance equipment. His most valuable tool turns out to be the eyewitness account of a young boy whose father encountered the tiger. The scenes with Dafoe navigating Tasmanias wilds (it was filmed on location) are among The Hunters most interesting and picturesque moments. Less successful is the interaction between David and the family renting him a room. These sequences lack the emotional resonance and depth needed to ""earn"" the ending. They are frequently artificial and feel more like filler than genuine character-building drama. Frances OConnor is wasted in a dead-end role. If anything Sam Neills part is even more pointless but its always welcome to see Neill regardless of the context. Dafoe is his usual gruff self providing us with an effective aloof and socially inept David but failing to transition the hunter believably to involved and attached. The character arc is strong on paper but not well-realized on film and therein lies The Hunters greatest failing. From a technical standpoint director David Nettheim (who has a strong TV resume) does an excellent job but he is less apt when handling conventional dramatic elements. The plot points are all there. We understand whats going on. But it often fails to engage on a meaningful level. The Hunters most forceful moment of tragedy happens so quickly that it feels like a sucker punch. Theres a sense that complex subplots have been truncated to satisfy the need for a reasonable running length. I havent read the source material but that is a frequent occurrence with adapted screenplays. The novel upon which The Hunter is based was written by Julia Leigh who made her screenwriting/directorial debut in 2011 with Sleeping Beauty. She was not directly involved in the reworking of her book into a film. Wherever in the process things went awry there are problems with the writing. The Hunter has too many dangling secondary stories and a final scene that simply doesnt work. And although there is something poetic about how the Tasmanian tiger element is resolved Im not sure I accept those actions from this character. Being told a character has changed is not the same thing as believing it to be true. Theres too much of the former and too little of the latter. The Hunter works best as a travelogue and a thought-piece about the ugly shadowy side of resurrecting dead species. The premise - that a company would be willing to extinguish a very rare animal to profit from sole possession of its DNA - is credible and not something I had considered before seeing The Hunter. On the other hand those hoping to see a man-versus-nature adventure like The Grey will be sorely disappointed. Theres value in the film but mainly for those who enjoy being taken by film to unusual locales for off-road explorations.

I can believe a guy can be thrown off a downtown New York building (at ""Sixth and Rivington"") and investigators would be too dumb to figure out it wasnt a suicide. I can believe a reporter who bumped into a police horse with her car could be thrown in jail on 50000 bail. What I cant believe is that any woman who looks like Jennifer Aniston can be found working at the Daily News. City reporter Nicole (Aniston) -- the ace journo whose talent becomes apparent when we get a glimpse of her story headlined ""Fighting Parking Tickets Gets Tougher"" -- skips a court date because shes chasing the phony suicide story so her ex Milo (Gerard Butler) is hired as ""The Bounty Hunter"" tasked with tracking her down. Nicole and Milo despite their recent divorce are kinda sweet on each other -- you can tell by the way they keep saying they hate each other -- so while we await the inevitable ending they ""banter"" i.e. exchange some of the dullest lines youll see this spring that are not actually included in the instructions to your 1040 form. Looming in the distance is a mandatory candlelit dinner at which the lovebirds will begin to coo again with soundtrack piano set on Maximum Tinkle. PHOTOS A BOUNTY OF JEN amp; GERARD PHOTOS GERARD BUTLERS LADY CONQUESTS Meanwhile to soak up screen time we dip into the background to check in with a nerdy suitor (Jason Sudeikis) who thinks hes rescuing Nicole but keeps getting tortured by the bad guys for no reason except maybe for fun and Nicoles horny old-bat lounge-singer mom (Christine Baranski done up like Endora on ""Bewitched"") who demands a cellphone photo of Milos bare bottom at the earliest opportunity. Someday ""The Bounty Hunter"" and last months ""Cop Out"" will be featured in a cable movie double bill as the two worst 1988 films of 2010. This one replays ""Midnight Run"" except now the Charles Grodin figure has soft glowy hair of solar-panel wattage. The photovoltaic lustrousness of the Aniston mane is the only energy source present and if the two leads did indeed get it on off-screen they certainly dont bring it off on-screen. The feuding lovebirds lug their rusty badinage down to Atlantic City for a series of thinly cloaked ads for the Borgata and the Trump Taj Mahal. Then they make their way back up here to the big city to solve a dirty-cop mystery of such waiting-in-line-at-the-post-office tediousness that I could actually feel unused neurons turning as brown and crispy as autumn leaves. PHOTOS GERARD BUTLER PHOTOS JEN ANISTON GERARD BUTLER FLIRT AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES No particular reason is given for the couples breakup except that they have would-be cute little spats. Yet it seems unlikely that anything Milo previously did to Nicole to drive her away could be as unforgivable as what he now does when wooing her back. This includes locking her in the trunk while he drives pulling a gun on her and handcuffing her to a bed all night. His behavior would be considered shocking in any man who isnt a New York state senator. Dialogue. I wont quote more than one line per paragraph because I dont want any cerebral hemorrhages on my conscience. ""Its powerful its dangerous its hard. That would be my gun."" ""If its your birthday Milo thinks the best present is the gift of nothing."" ""Im pretty sure the only guy around here that wants to kill you is me"" is said just as one of several easily foiled master villains drives up alongside and starts shooting. When trying to fake membership in a country club Nicole and Milo tell the membership director ""We know John. You know John?"" An exchange that sounds like it was cut from the shooting script of ""Love Story"" goes ""I mean life is about making mistakes."" The reply ""And death is about wishing youd made a lot more."" This last big idea is positioned as the turning point the magic moment of understanding. Perhaps the filmmakers envision themselves in old age saying ""Dang you Grim Reaper I wish Id turned down all those masterpieces and made more bad movies."" Judging by the number of putrid films Aniston -- and even despite a late start Butler -- have managed to churn out I dont think that thought will ever cross their minds. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Amanpour leaving CNN to host ABCs This Week Read Next Amanpour leaving CNN to host ABCs This Week Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46913 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 19317 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18669 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Starring Gerard Butler Jennifer Aniston Christine Baranski Jason Sudeikis Natalie Morales Cathy Moriarty Daisy Tahan Siobhan Fallon Ruby Feliciano Dorian Missick Director Andy Tennant Release Opened Mar 19 2010  Editorial Review This attempt at offbeat humor doesnt deliverBy Dan KoisFriday March 19 2010Slack when it should be tight dull when it needs to be sharp ""The Bounty Hunter"" represents a failed attempt to make an Elmore Leonard movie without having to pay Elmore Leonard money. You know Leonard the author of scores of novels the source of such beloved comic capers as ""Out of Sight"" ""Get Shorty"" and ""Jackie Brown."" ""The Bounty Hunter"" hits all the expected Elmore-ian notes a neer-do-well hero a rogues gallery of colorful crooks and a tart love story all set to the beat of a jazzy score. But ""The Bounty Hunter"" just proves how difficult it is to fake Leonards sweet easy rhythms -- and how sour a movie can turn when you get it wrong.The movie explains its high concept with some artless captions in the opening scene identifying a squabbling couple along the side of a New Jersey highway as Milo Boyd (""bounty hunter"") and Nicole Hurley (""convicted felon""). Milo played by Gerard Butler is a fired New York cop whos now tracking down criminals who skip bail. Nicole (Jennifer Aniston) is a brittle reporter who missed a court date for a traffic accident that turned into an assaulting-an-officer charge. And oh yes -- deep breath -- they used to be married. (Though Butler and Aniston lack all chemistry Milo and Nicole do have in common unwarranted self-regard and total unlikability so it makes enough sense.)""The Bounty Hunter"" enmeshes these two repellent characters often handcuffed to each other in a convoluted plot that includes loan sharks bickering thugs horny newsmen crooked cops and guylinered tattoo artists. Soon Milo and Nicole are on the run in Atlantic City renewing their love-hate relationship. The filmmakers clearly believe that their tangled storyline is madcap and delightful but each new complication just serves to make us feel as though the blessed end of the movie is creeping further and further away.Granted the movies overpopulation does allow a few of the bit players to steal their scenes. Christine Baranski is dependably over-the-top as Nicoles aging-showgirl mom and Siobhan Fallon Hogan gets more laughs than anyone else in the movie as the deadpan manager at Milos bail bond office.But ""The Bounty Hunter"" even blows its bit-part casting For goodness sake who puts national treasure Carol Kane in a movie and gives her nothing to do as a milquetoast Bamp;B owner?The efforts of its plentiful supporting characters aside ""The Bounty Hunter"" fails in its scene-by-scene job of being engaging and funny. You cant blame this entirely on its stars; we already know Aniston can be charming and Im sure that someone somewhere sees some flicker of charisma in Butler (""300"" ""Law Abiding Citizen""). But Sarah Thorps screenplay feels like a never-ending series of pointless arguments between jerks. And director Andy Tennant (""Hitch"") gives his film no snap; few scenes have any discernible comic timing or point of view and the movie feels saggy and overlong at 106 minutes.If youre looking for an authentically gritty and fun Elmore Leonard entertainment it just so happens that the Leonard-produced ""Justified"" premiered on FX this week. But if you find yourself dragged in to endure this charmless comedy . . . well you should bail.Contains sexual content including suggestive comments language and some violence.

"The Hunter review When prey and predator collide |       NJ.com comments The Hunter review When prey and predator collide Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 05 2012 at 1107 PM View/Post Comments MAGNOLIAPrey or predator? Willem Dafoe is a bit of both in ""The Hunter"" ""The Hunter"" starts like another typically cold self-consciously amoral hitman movie. There is a meeting in a foreign city. The location and target are discussed. Is there need for an assistant? The killer insists he works alone. Do the clients want the body? No just some biological ""samples."" Its a curious request but then the target isnt human. Its a rare animal thought to be extinct. And the client thinks theres bioengineering money to be made if they can just get a good hunk of DNA. Its a curious request but then the target isnt human. Its a rare animal thought to be extinct. And the client thinks theres bioengineering money to be made if they can just get a good hunk of DNA. You see the animal in question is a real one a Tasmanian tiger - presumed to have been wiped out back in the `30s. But every so often some fellow swears hes seen one - at least one. And so off this man goes to kill it. So yes this is ""The Mechanic"" - but with a definite ecological twist. Its an interesting idea and one clearly meant to carry some metaphorical weight. ""I wonder if shes the last one"" the hunter muses. ""Alone. Just hunting and killing. Waiting to die."" Hes talking about the lonely little marsupial supposedly. But clearly hes talking about himself as well. Yet this hunter remains a riddle wrapped inside an enigma wrapped inside a dirty windbreaker. He draws us in - given that hes played by the charismatic enigmatic Willem Dafoe theres almost no way that he wouldnt. Yet its bait without a trap because once we do allow ourselves to be lured in - nothing really happens. Or at least nothing more than we expect. Dafoe goes into the woods. He checks for tracks. He hears a noise. He checks his scope. Things threaten to get more complicated when he meets a single mother. Her husband went in search of the beast and never came back; she suspects Dafoe may be headed down that same path. And then she begins to suspect something else. Clearly the hunt is on. But whos the hunter and whos the hunted? There are a few hints of that question in the film and some ironies (the local loggers view Dafoe as a hated ""greenie"" some environmentalist who wants to shut down their local industry; actually hes the furthest thing from an environmentalist you can imagine). And eventually things do pick up - although some of that seems forced and some of it a little confused - until finally theres a poetic philosophical and not altogether convincing resolution. But mostly this is just too mild too quiet too distant. It tracks its target. But it never quite manages to get it in its sites. Ratings note The film contains strong language and violence. The Hunter (R) Magnolia (90 min.) Directed by Daniel Nettheim. With Willem Dafoe. Now playing in New York.

"Bounty Hunter fails to capture laughs or anything else - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Bounty Hunter fails to capture laughs or anything else Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Barry Wetcher Columbia Pictures Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler share little chemistry in The Bounty Hunter. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Bounty Hunter (out ouf four)Stars Jennifer Aniston Gerard Butler Jason Sudeikis Jeff Garlin Cathy MoriartyDirector Andy TennantDistributor Columbia PicturesRating PG-13 for sexual content including suggestive comments language and some violenceRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesOpens today nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Just whose idea of fun is it to watch two ex-spouses verbally slam each other? But thats what The Bounty Hunter has rustled up -- along with a listless rom-com a feeble thriller and a supporting cast of clueless characters. Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston are embroiled in a contentious round of ""ex games."" The overriding feeling watching these two obnoxious souls is that they deserve each other. We never find out what drew them to each other or tore them apart or even what they still see in each other so its tough to care about whether theyll reunite. Worse Aniston and Butler cant seem to muster any believable chemistry. A lot of mugging happens but no magic. Butler plays Milo Boyd a bounty hunter and former cop who gets an assignment to round up his ex-wife Nicole Hurly (Aniston) who failed to show up in court for a minor infraction. Suddenly shes a wanted woman. Its a forced conceit and so are the exasperating efforts Milo makes to ensnare Nicole. He chases her throws her over his shoulder and locks her in his trunk. Shes supposed to be a feisty and dedicated investigative reporter but mostly she runs around in short skirts and high heels. Ultra-broad attempts at comedy consistently fall flat as the two doggedly try to outsmart and hoodwink each other amid knowing smirks and smug grins. Director Andy Tennants last effort was Fools Gold(2008) another chemistry-free romantic comedy starring Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson. At least there when you got bored of the formulaic story you could gaze out to sea. Here endless stretches of Jersey highway would make even Bruce Springsteen long for a rest stop.

"Bounty Hunter runs out of gas - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Bounty Hunter runs out of gasJennifer Aniston has great hair and Gerard Butler has roguish charm but its not enough for the action-comedy.March 19 2010|By BETSY SHARKEY | Film Critic ""The Bounty Hunter"" the new action caper starring Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler as dueling exes plays to everything that turned one of the ""Friends"" six-pack into a lip-gloss superstar. First to be exploited is Anistons perk power. When that fails the second line of defense is a close-up of that really great hair which doesnt so much make for a movie as a running photo op. Somehow Aniston is better at looking sexy than acting sexy. And though there were many reports of just how hot a couple she and Butler were off screen during filming none of that translated after director Andy Tennant yelled ""action."" Try as they might Nicole and Milo as they are called in the movie dont steam. Wispy vapors is about as good as it gets.Hot is the operative word the filmmakers swear by here. Its July in NYC jungle fever is in the air. Nicole is a Daily News reporter in a tight pencil skirt and a tighter shirt. Shes so obsessed with a murder case that she misses a court date for a traffic ticket she really wanted to fight. That bad call a judge with a bad attitude and a bench warrant triggers an unexpected reunion for the estranged pair while fulfilling the revenge fantasy of a lifetime since Milo is the bounty hunter who gets to bring her in.To make matters better and worse her career has taken off since the marriage crumbled while Milos has gone into the proverbial toilet. He was once a top NYPD cop but a nasty gambling habit and the divorce blues got him kicked off the force and hes been reduced to bounty hunting to pay the bills.So even before Nicole jumped bail and he got the job Milo had an ax to grind with his ex. Fortunately for everyone concerned hes also got handcuffs which come in handy for those his-and-hers handcuffed to the headboard moments that come as such a surprise.Like paper dolls Nic and Milos antics are strung from New York to Atlantic City as countless interlocking ""she runs he runs faster"" scenarios play out. Anyone can tell these crazy kids are still in love including a very dry Christine Baranski as Nics mother an aging diva playing the casino circuit with a martini also dry always in hand.The bad guys tied to the murder soon join in as do a couple of toughs out to make Milo pay up on his gambling debts which is a grand excuse for some nifty car chases and freeway shoot outs. To add a bit more comic relief ""SNLs"" Jason Sudeikis as Stewart a bumbling misguided suitor from work whos convinced that Nicole is his soul mate is in pursuit too.Butler whose abs made their most memorable appearance in ""300"" is a good foil for Aniston; where she plays big he plays bigger so I guess size does matter. In the years since the swords-and-sandals saga hes become something of Hollywoods go-to guy for truly wretched romances in need of a roguish charmer (""The Ugly Truth"" and ""P.S. I Love You"" ugh). Now with ""Bounty Hunter"" in which he does roguish charmer again there is the worry that roles that could use the haunting presence he brought to ""Phantom of the Opera"" will take a back seat to the mush. (On a positive note the abs are holding up really well.)Meanwhile Tennant applies the same soft touch to screenwriter Sarah Thorps fast frothy affair that he did to ""Hitch"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama."" Its a wise choice to keep things light and wiser to keep things on the move because when the bickering couple is forced to make a detour to avoid some of the dangerous crooks on their tail the slow tease at the Bamp;B where they honeymooned is a snoozer.What works best are the tightly constructed short scenes that call for Aniston to play impossibly cute and adorably feisty with Butler offering up an appropriately burly chest for her to beat on. When it comes to Aniston maybe its simply time to settle and stop asking her to be ""The Good Girl"" anymore -- perky just might be as good as it gets.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVES2013 Fall Movie Preview complete listAugust 30 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentBounty HunterCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-bounty19-2010mar19,0,3015996.story",200,thebountyhunter22,thebountyhunter,latimes

(Our consensus nose boobs Botox.) Its not Anistons fault shell be playing a variation on her ""Friends"" character or the rest of her life nor is it her fault ""The Bounty Hunter"" tanks so badly. As Nicole Hurley an ambitious reporter shes tracking a hot lead that plunges her into danger ... and as a convicted felon shes on the lam from her bounty hunter ex-husband Milo Boyd (Gerard Butler). Aniston isnt the worlds greatest actress but the main reason ""The Bounty Hunter"" stinks is the script. Its riddled with rom-com cliches action-movie standbys and a confusing web of subplots involving Milos gambling debt and a shady policeman. The stunted dialogue tries too hard to be clever and comes off like a cop sitcom or a made-for-TV movie. As Anistons cad of an ex Gerard Butler swaggers around with burly machismo but the two lack the snappy chemistry their roles require. At times they get close; Anistons eyebrows raise wryly and she manages a few zings at Butler but he just cant do tough guy with a soft side. Hes better off swinging a sword and screaming a la ""300."" ""The Bounty Hunter"" wants to be a rom-com that men and women can enjoy together but theres nothing here for dudes but stuff that blows up and more than a few peeks down Jen Anistons top and theres nothing for ladies but a shirtless Butler and a few sappy lines about love lost and found. Theres no heat or passion between the pair and their inevitable reunion will leave the audience rolling their eyes. Though ""The Bounty Hunter"" runs less than two hours it feels centuries longer. It takes Nicole and Milo ages to rediscover what weve known since the opening credits Theyre going to fall back in love. ""Bonnie amp; Clyde"" this sure aint.

(Or was it suicide?)While following a hot lead Nicole (Aniston) crime reporter for the New York Daily News misses a court date for a parking infraction. When the judge issues a bench warrant for her arrest Milo (Butler) a former cop now in the employ of a bail bondsman jumps at the chance to drag her to jail. Before he can though she drags him on a manhunt that takes them through New Jersey from Monmouth Park Racetrack to Atlantic City where Nicoles debauched mom (the reliably funny Christine Baranski) works as a cabaret singer.Director Andy Tennant responsible both for the charming Hitch and the charmless Fools Gold hasnt much of a script to work with this time. Perhaps he thought the saucy appeal of his stars would fill in the plot sinkholes?Tennant aims for a contemporary version of The Thin Man wedding the banter of sparring spouses with sleuth work. To say that he falls short of the mark is understatement. He doesnt even come close. And despite Anistons carbonated tickle and Butlers sandpaper charm neither do they.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickeyat 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Based on the onscreen evidence not a single person in front of or behind the camera cared a whit about how The Bounty Hunter turned out. Director Andy Tennant and his two stars Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston are all battle-tested veterans of forgettable romantic comedies Tennant is responsible for Fools Rush In Sweet Home Alabama Hitch and Fools Gold; Butler played creeps of different flavors in P.S. I Love You and The Ugly Truth; and Aniston hasnt stopped squandering her guileless charm in the likes of Picture Perfect Along Came Polly and Love Happens. Together the three seem perfectly content just to toss another movie onto the pile drifting along on star power generic thriller plotting and the standard bicker-bicker-bicker-bicker-near-kiss-bicker-kiss formula. Some movies are passion projects; The Bounty Hunter is an inertia project. The logline for the film is simple enough Butler is a shady bounty hunter who gets the plum assignment of tracking down Aniston his bail-jumping ex-wife. Yet Tennant and screenwriter Sarah Thorp tack on so many complications that they spend much of the running time sorting them all out. Turns out that Aniston a journalist charged with assaulting a police officer skipped her court appearance to investigate a suicide case that she believes is a murder cover-up. Butler catches up to her easily but the case whisks them from Queens to Atlantic City and back again as they chase (and are chased by) bookie Cathy Moriarty a possibly crooked cop and various bungling heavies. Beyond the usual frisky back-and-forth that occurs in ""remarriage comedies"" The Bounty Hunter promises a modicum of kink since handcuffs are naturally part of the job. But in spite of Anistons assortment of Ally McBeal skirts with hemlines an inch or two short of primly professional Tie Me Up Tie Me Down this is not. The PG-13 rating draws strict enough boundaries as it is but Tennant seems to believe the audience is at least as interested in half-assed procedural as they might be in seeing two attractive stars generate some spark. (And the less said about Jason Sudeikis embarrassing odyssey as Anistons goofy lovelorn mustachioed colleague the better.) Tennant and his actors have done the bare minimum to carry their lifeless movie past the finish line and their apathy reads a lot like contempt.

Jennifer Anistons hair plays a New York Daily News crime reporter who stumbles onto corruption at the precinct house. Gerard Butlers scowl plays her ex a former policeman now working as a bounty hunter. For reasons that dont matter she misses a court date and he pursues her -- for the 5000 reward he says not love -- to Atlantic City. Also in pursuit are a dirty cop a couple of thugs dispatched by Butlers bookie and Anistons colleague (Jason Sudeikis) who has a crush on her plus an even deeper love for pastel V-neck sweater vests. Produced by the team behind Sweet Home Alabama The Bounty Hunter embraces every stereotype about bickering mismatched couples Hes the slovenly lout with a bruised heart; shes the Type-A career woman wearing the skimpiest outfit and highest heels in the newsroom -- yet somethings missing from her life. That he has to arrest her for them to confront their feelings isnt a bad screwball premise but the script has all the spunk of Ikea-bookcase assembly instructions. The Bounty Hunter is a no less flimsy a product (though if you removed the two stars -- with zero chemistry between them -- matters would be greatly improved. Besides Sudeikis there are small enjoyable bits from Jeff Garlin Siobhan Fallon Hogan and Christine Baranski). On the soundtrack Jerry Reed sings ""She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)."" Viewers will know exactly the same feeling. (Brian Miller) (Citywide) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - CITY ISLAND Everyone in the Rizzo family has something to hide Paterfamilias Vince (Andy Garcia) works as a corrections officer but sneaks off for acting lessons; legal-secretary matriarch Joyce (Julianna Margulies) makes out with Tony (Steven Strait) the ex-con Vince has invited to live with them in the Bronx fishing village of the films title; daughter Vivian (Dominik Garcia-Lorido Andys kid) lost her college scholarship and now strips; and teen Vince Jr. (Afterschools Ezra Miller) chases chubbies. The secrets and lies overstuff the plot -- a thread involving Vince and a fellow thesp hopeful played by Emily Mortimer is especially superfluous -- and sets up too many misunderstandings played for laughs culminating in the usual tidy conclusion of forgiveness and acceptance. But writer-director Raymond De Felitta (2000s Two Family House) keeps his comedy of dysfunction afloat with sharp specifics ""I went to Oneonta"" Joyce protests at the dinner table after Vince warns his kids of the dead-end future of those who are B.A.-less like Mom and Dad. An affectionate portrait of a lower-middle-class outer-borough clan City Island works best as an actors showcase with Margulies aggrieved simmering wife the standout. Though his accent is inconsistent Garcia fully explores the corrosive consequences of having to conceal a dog-eared copy of An Actor Prepares in the bathroom. (Melissa Anderson) (Citywide)DIARY OF A WIMPY KID With stick figures and crisply funny journal entries Jeff Kinneys cartoon series breathed fresh life into pre-teen lits most exhausted trope -- the twisted tribal etiquette of middle school. Screenwriters Jackie and Jeff Filgos respect for Kinneys sharply observant dialogue is the chief virtue of this fairly capable screen version. But the transition to live action is stylistically a trip to the ordinary in the hands of director Thor Freudenthal (though its still a step up from his excruciating Hotel for Dogs). For Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) a flawed wiseguy cursed with small stature and an inflated view of his own gifts middle school is an endless obstacle race against his shortcomings as well as big bullies more evolved girls and stray boogers not to mention a slice of cootie-ridden cheese festering in the schoolyard. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is sweet and funny at either end but in between it sags with endless repetition of gross bodily functions and Gregs torment at the hands of larger angrier or more popular kids -- in that order. Robert Capron is pure joy as the fat best friend who knows who he is enjoys life and practices loyalty by instinct. (Ella Taylor) (Citywide)THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO Essentially a locked-room mystery with lashings of gore and sexual brutality Stieg Larssons novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo disguised the simplicity of its narrative by embedding it within an almost Balzacian depiction of Swedish society warts and all (but mainly warts). Niels Arden Oplevs adaptation relies more on the mystery but has two complex compelling leads driving its story. Mikael Blomqvist (Michael Nyqvist) a disgraced investigative journalist is asked by industrialist Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube) to investigate the disappearance of his niece from a family reunion 40 years ago. A finite number of suspects emerges mostly members of Vangers hugely dysfunctional dynasty aged Swedish Nazis venal old aunts creepy brothers and cousins. Blomqvist teams with Lisbeth Salander who is the true star of Larssons books a state-raised quasi-autistic computer hacker with a horrifying past and an alarmingly black-and-white sense of morality. Played by Noomi Rapace -- the real discovery here -- Salander is a walking time bomb of injuries and resentments. Together they disinter the Vanger familys grotesque secrets while somebody -- a still-active serial sex-murderer perhaps? -- uses increasingly violent methods to try to stop them. An elegant contraction of the novel discarding Blomqvists sexual bravado and thus saving Larsson from his own worst tendencies The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo may be a shallower experience than the book but it has a headlong velocity all its own. Catch it before the inevitable U.S. remake. (John Patterson) (Landmark Playhouse Town Center) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

If theres one thing that Space Station 3-D producer/director Toni Myers new IMAX doc about the Hubble achieves its making audiences feel like insignificant specks in the universe as when ""zooming in"" to the tiny newly forming galaxies hiding in the gaseous clouds of each star in Orions Belt. More futility may be found in the films primary agenda a first-person snapshot of 2009s final rescue mission in which seven astronauts risked their necks to fix the telescope manually making it the most dangerous job in tech-support history. Even at 43 minutes short with earnest but marketable narration by Leonardo DiCaprio and one amusing zero-gravity taco-preparation scene Hubble 3-Ds perilous endeavors are about as thrilling to watch as plumbers snaking a drain ... in space suits If you want an eye-popping cosmic epic rent Star Trek. If you want interactivity take the kids to the planetarium. (Aaron Hillis) (Citywide)THE KILLING JAR When a filmmaker sets a group of innocents in a dead-end restaurant and has them terrorized by a crazed gunman its probably not his goal to have viewers think ""Just fucking shoot everyone."" But the flesh bearers in writer-director Mark Youngs The Killing Jar (its too big a stretch to actually call them characters) are by and large either gratingly stupid or insufferably one-dimensional. Theres no reason for them to live and Young gives you no reason to care. Its just before closing in a small-town cafe in which a handful of yokel locals (the sheriff being the biggest dunce of all) are polishing off remnants of their meals. The radio ominously broadcasts the news that in a nearby town an entire family has been brutally murdered and the assailant is on the loose. Two men enter the establishment shortly after one of them played by Michael Madsen. Can you guess which is psycho? The film has no pulse and feels interminable with its stilted dialogue static staging and usually fine actors who are horrendous here -- Amber Benson is all moist-eyed empathy as the waitress while Madsen is laughably bad dredging his dialogue up with much volume but transparent (and completely understandable) indifference to everything around him. (Ernest Hardy) (Beverly Center)NEIL YOUNG TRUNK SHOW In contrast to 2006s amber-lit prayerful Neil Young Heart of Gold a stately acoustic set at Nashvilles tradition-rich Ryman Auditorium Trunk Show the second in Jonathan Demmes planned trilogy of Young-in-concert movies is a slapdash job -- endearingly so. The stage dressing looks well like backstage. Young in a paint-spackled button-up resembles an aging action painter and scrambles around like one. Demme rolls together two sets from 2007s Chrome Dreams II tour shot outside Philadelphia into an 83-minute package. About 20 of those go to Young and looongtime band mates beating the hell out of ""No Hidden Path"" until the tenacious comeback riff finally gives up the ghost. The set juggles between acoustic and electric with Young taking breaks at piano (""A Man Needs a Maid"") and banjo (""Mellow My Mind""). Action is mostly covered with handheld cameras usually in close-up while Youngs on the mike making the most gruesome delivery-face outside of MLB pitchers and porn actors. Removing even stage banter the focus is entirely on performance save for a few ""candid backstage"" bits -- Young having a cracked nail filed down etc. Devotees will thrill to rarities like ""Kansas"" and ""Mexico."" The unconverted will go see The Bounty Hunter instead -- and have significantly worse lives. (Nick Pinkerton) (Nuart)PRODIGAL SONS Kimberly Reed was born Paul McKerrow in Helena Montana the middle of three sons; then he was the high school quarterback and voted Most Likely to Succeed. Returning to Big Sky Country in 2005 for her 20th high school reunion Reed finds most of her classmates unfazed by her new gender; the real conflict is between the blond willowy filmmaker and her adopted older brother Marc -- fat balding and prone to paroxysms of rage brought on by a head injury at age 21. As with most fam-cam documentaries dysfunction pushes the story along tipping over into exploitation. Despite a fascinating midpoint revelation -- seeking information about his biological parents -- Marc discovers hes the grandson of Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles (Marc most resembles Welles Touch of Evil character Hank Quinlan) -- Reed spends too much time capturing her siblings terrifying outbursts devoting the films final act almost exclusively to his increasingly abject circumstances. ""I felt like Marc would have given anything to be the man I would have given anything not to be"" Reed says at one point -- an intriguing line of inquiry that remains underexplored in lieu of shattered glass choke holds 911 calls and prison visits. (Melissa Anderson) (Citywide) THE RED BARON Academy Award season may finally be over but if youre still craving Oscar bait The Red Baron will appeal to those with a weakness for stuffy lavish period biopics. Writer-director Nikolai Muellerschoen chronicles the last two years in the life of Baron Manfred von Richthofen (Matthias Schweighofer) the World War I German fighter pilot famous for his skill at downing enemy fliers who flamboyantly dubbed himself the Red Baron. Perhaps its because the boyishly-handsome Schweighofer appeared with Tom Cruise in Valkyrie but its impossible not to think of The Red Baron as an amalgam of that stars two military-themed 80s films This combat drama starts as a simplistic portrait of a cocky flyboy (a la Top Gun) before it becomes a strident war-is-hell sermon (Born on the Fourth of July). Just as von Richthofens superiors crudely exploited his growing celebrity making him a propaganda tool for the German military so too does Muellerschoen reduce the character to a mouthpiece for the filmmakers fairly standard observations about how governments prop up war heroes to further their own agenda. The films press notes flaunt the fact that The Red Baron with its handsome production design and extravagant effects was made outside the Hollywood system but unfortunately Muellerschoens movie emphasizes empty grandeur over human drama. In that way The Red Baron is more like an American film that its makers would probably care to admit. (Tim Grierson) (Mann Chinese 6)SEE WHAT IM SAYING See What Im Saying an involving new documentary by Hilari Scarl uncovers an interesting entertainment subculture of deaf comedians actors and musicians. The film follows actor CJ Jones comedian Robert DeMayo drummer Bob Hiltermann and punk-rock throwback TL as they strive for acknowledgment from hearing as well as hearing-impaired communities. Scarl shapes these four stories into a well-oiled showbiz narrative complete with a clearly demarcated three-act structure that moves conventionally from setup to setback to a final payoff in the form of the big show. The proceedings become a little predictable under this structure and Scarl relies too heavily on music for emotional cues -- an ironic misstep for a documentary about and partially made for the hearing-impaired. But to her credit and the credit of the featured performers See What Im Saying creates genuine empathy for its heroes. Their struggle becomes not just about translating deaf culture to a hearing audience but about the problems any artist faces on the road to being seen and heard. Most valuably at its heart See What Im Saying strikes at the nature of communication itself. When DeMayo delivers a passionately signed nearly silent speech about the distance his disability created between him and his mother the film finds its emotional core. Much of the music and comedy translates as well which is really just as important to reaching a wider audience. (John Wheeler) (Sunset 5)GO  SEVERE CLEAR Between the past few years worth of Iraq War docs and on-the-ground TV reports its easy to believe that collectively we definitively understand the monotonous yet dangerous daily existence of U.S. soldiers in the Middle East. Kristian Fragas unexpectedly captivating first-person perspective of Operation Iraqi Freedom circa 2003 proves we dont. Fragas director credit is a slight misnomer as Severe Clear was mostly culled from the raw mini-DV footage of Marine First Lieutenant Mike Scotti -- with added voice-over and onscreen titles both ripped from his journal entries -- shot as he and his gung-ho company deployed to Baghdad in search of dutiful adventure hooah Though front-loaded with scenes of homoerotic horseplay and amusing overheard moments (someone wins a bet that Jack Black co-starred in Twister a rumor circulates that Jennifer Lopez has died) this is no recruitment video and emotions speak louder than politics in the grisly images of splattered heads and equally uncensored opinions about the confusing ""liberation"" of the Iraqi people. Even if were burned out on this never-ending quandary witnessing what Scotti bravely (stupidly?) films in the middle of harrowing firefights is a potent reminder of how thankless a soldiers job is. (Aaron Hillis) (Music Hall) STOLEN First-time scripter Glenn Taranto was inspired to write Stolen after reading an article about the real-life unsolved ""Boy in the Box"" murder case of 1957. Its uncertain whether or not Taranto and debuting helmer Anders Anderson looked at the Law amp; Order SVU and Cold Case episodes that also used the crime as a plot thread; the sub-televisual incompetence of their film suggests not. Two parallel stories about aggrieved fathers unfold In 1958 recent widower Matthew (Josh Lucas) struggles to provide for his three sons including mentally challenged John (whose impairment is conveyed by tonsorial anachronism sporting an unruly mid-60s mop top); present-day detective Tom (Jon Hamm) is obsessed with tracking down the person responsible for his sons disappearance eight years earlier. In the lead-up to the inevitable connection Anderson builds suspense around innumerable close-ups of telephone touch pads liquids being spilled Lucas straining to be a credible hayseed the sight of a Dawsons Creek star (James Van Der Beek) in bad old-man makeup and the question of whether Hamm was so unsure about the longevity of Mad Men whose first season had already premiered by the time shooting for Stolen started that he said yes to this. (Melissa Anderson)TALES FROM THE SCRIPT Not surprisingly for a documentary on the trials tribulations and occasional triumphs of being a Hollywood screenwriter Tales From the Script is full of wry one-liners well-spun anecdotes and pithy observations on the movie-making industry. Guinevere Turner pulls off all of the above in a hilarious tale of working with the infamous Uwe Boll. But director Peter Hanson doesnt really push his numerous talking heads (including William Goldman Allison Anders John Carpenter Antwone Fisher) beyond soft confirmation of what is already well known The writer is treated worse than a red-headed stepchild; the film industry is largely run by bean-counting Philistines; the disintegrating state of the industry makes the writers life even more precarious. Filmed in the most basic point-and-shoot style the amiable Tales breaks up its parade of interviews with film clips (Get Shorty Barton Fink The Muse) that illustrate Hollywoods ability to issue self-critiques that are paradoxically withering and self-aggrandizing. But one of Tales strongest points is made accidentally Its huge cast of interviewees consists of one Asian speaker one Latino three African-Americans and five women -- one of whom pulls double duty as a woman of color.

Now he gets to be a bit of both in the romantic comedy ""The Bounty Hunter."" The Bounty Hunter Fair to good Director Andy Tennant. Cast Jennifer Aniston Gerard Butler. Rating PG-13 for suggestive comments language and violence. RELATED Spotlight Jennifer Aniston Spotlight Gerard Butler Journalism in the movies Pop-culture bounty hunters A fun role no doubt and sharing the screen with Jennifer Aniston must have made it that much more fun. As investigative reporter Nicole Hurley Aniston holds her own in the crime story while showing off just how good 41 can look in a tight suit. Now thats a 21st-century heroine. As formula films go ""The Bounty Hunter"" is more enjoyable than most even if it packs in as many cliches as any. Its certainly a career highlight for director Andy Tennant (""Sweet Home Alabama"" ""Hitch""). And even if it wont be at the top of Anistons resume its a perfectly enjoyable way to kill a couple of hours. Butler plays Milo Boyd a onetime hotshot police detective who was fired presumably for some secret noble reason that has nothing to do with his 11000 in gambling debts. When his ex-wife misses a court date to follow a lead on a story Milo is called in 5000 to deliver her to the police. He makes the most of a visit to Nicoles home dunking her toothbrush in the toilet and erasing her TiVo queue. Ooh that guy is really angry at her. They must secretly still love each other. You know because its a movie. Milo finds Nicole of course but she wont go without a fight. Joining the chase are two sets of bad guys thanks to Milos bookie and Nicoles investigation which involves dirty cops. Theres a golf-course chase scene complete with driving-range mayhem and a final faceoff in a warehouse setting (police-evidence storage in this case). Along the way we are amused by Christine Baranski as Nicoles lascivious mom Kitty and by Jason Sudeikis (""Saturday Night Live"") as Nicoles ineffectual co-worker and stalker Stewart (""Nicole its Stewart Im here to save you"" Thanks Luke). Only in the peculiar universe of rom-com action can we laugh at Stewarts fate when the bookies enforcers mistake him for Milo. But no matter. If theres anything here to make you uncomfortable the next twist in the improbable plot will make you forget soon enough. Reach the reporter at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

Well say hello to the Gerard Butler era. The grizzled Scottish hunk doesnt just look like a modern-day caveman; in every movie hes made since 300 in 2006 he acts like one too. He gnashes his lines speaking in a jaunty domineering growl. And his bite is just as bad as his bark. In last summers The Ugly Truth he taught Katherine Heigl that what women really want is a good old male chauvinist alpha brute. Now in The Bounty Hunter he teaches the same lesson with even less nuance to Jennifer Aniston. The two play a couple who have already been married and divorced. Hes an ex-cop who is now a bounty hunter and shes a New York Daily News investigative columnist who got arrested for assaulting a police officer. When at the last moment she skips a court date to meet a contact on a suspicious suicide case hes hired to retrieve her and bring her to jail. Which fills the hateful ex-husband with joy. The scenario may be as contrived as they come but for most of The Bounty Hunter I certainly believed that these two hate each other. The trouble with the movie is that we really want to see why they love each other. Theres no doubt that Butler is convincing in scenes where he has to lock Aniston in his car trunk chain her to a bed or rag on her for no reason in particular. Hes like Ralph Kramden in the body of Kirk Douglas. But Aniston whos her usual sweetly feisty and appealing self plays a woman whos having none of it. The two get one light fun scene together at an Atlantic City craps table but if youre wondering what finally unites them the answer is not great chemistry; its solving a crime. In The Bounty Hunter the couple that foils a bunch of tiresome grade-C thriller goons together stays together. Whether or not thats a recipe for love its certainly not a formula for romantic-comedy magic. C Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

There are no rewards to be claimed for enduring ""The Bounty Hunter."" This dire battle-of-the-exes action-comedy severely tests audience goodwill by running an indulgent 110 minutes crammed as it is with half-baked thriller subplots and aimless supporting characters as if to distract from the central duos nonstop bickering. Sony release could post solid opening numbers on the backs of its ill-served leads Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston but looks unlikely to prevail in the long run over sour word of mouth. Perhaps inadvertently helmer Andy Tennant and scenarist Sarah Thorp have fashioned a sort of modern-day reworking of ""His Girl Friday"" insofar as ""The Bounty Hunter"" is also a comedy of remarriage featuring a feisty femme reporter an ex-husband in hot pursuit and a raft of gun-toting shenanigans. (It also contains a shot of a newsroom teeming with gainfully employed print journalists an anachronism if ever there was one.) There however any comparisons with the Howard Hawks classic must come to an end; its more likely Tennant opted to recycle the warring-couple angle from his previous pic ""Fools Gold"" in a less tropical setting. Well mission completed (""accomplished"" isnt the word). Charged with an undisclosed felony New York investigative reporter Nicole (Aniston) skips bail to chase down a story involving a suspicious suicide and possible NYPD corruption. This turns out to be the ultimate revenge opportunity for her former spouse cop-turned-bounty hunter Milo (Butler) who is assigned to take Nicole into custody. Its a tidily contrived premise that takes an exhausting 20 minutes to set up delayed by a chase sequence in the middle of a Fourth of July parade and a clueless reporter (Jason Sudeikis) whose romantic interest in Nicole proves as obnoxious to the audience as it is to her. Milo soon tracks Nicole down in Atlantic City and their quarrelsome dynamic moves to the fore starting with a scene in which he temporarily stuffs her into the trunk of his car in broad daylight without a word of onlooker alarm. Relishing his legal authority over his ex-wife Milo begins their long drive back to New York -- and inevitably down memory lane -- with multiple farcical pit stops involving handcuffs a Taser a rickshaw a golf cart and a bag of money. Add a trigger-happy psycho (Peter Greene) and two thugs and its hard not to feel that all this strenuous over-complication amounts to a vote of no confidence in the two leads. A leaner smarter movie would have allowed them to carry the day. As it is the thesps are essentially retreading past roles -- Aniston was a brittle ex in ""The Break-Up"" Butler a cocksure pig in last years ""The Ugly Truth"" -- which wouldnt matter so much if their banter had half the sparkle of the Atlantic City casinos they keep driving past. The characters turbulent romantic history is referenced often but never explored; when it suddenly dawns on Nicole that she cant remember why she hates Milo in the first place its clear the filmmakers havent a clue either. Jeff Garlin Siobhan Fallon Hogan and Christine Baranski register fleetingly in throwaway roles. Tech credits are routine; Aniston and Butler arent always flatteringly lit and the music cues often seem to be shouting them down.
