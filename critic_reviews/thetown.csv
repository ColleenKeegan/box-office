By Peter Rainer Film critic September 17 2010 Save for later Saved From left Slaine Ben Affleck Jeremy Renner and Owen Burke are shown in a scene from The Town. Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""The Town"" is about a gang of thieves from the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown which reportedly has produced more bank and armored-car robbers than anywhere else in the country. Who said theres no such thing as robust job creation in America?Directed by Ben Affleck who also stars as robber ringleader Doug MacRay ""The Town"" is often fine around the edges but mushy at its core. The script by Affleck Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard based on the novel ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan draws less on life than on other similarly themed movies especially ""The Departed."" It draws even more on TV cop shows. (The fact that the film makes this explicit by giving Doug a speech about his fascination with the ""CSI"" series does not lessen the familiarity.)The tough-on-the-outside kind-hearted-on-the-inside Doug is matched by Claire (Rebecca Hall) the bank manager who is taken hostage by his crew (disguised as goblins) and then released unharmed. He subsequently seeks her out and romances her without her being aware that he was her captor. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Sweet-souled Claire with her yen for gardening and her volunteer work with children represents a better life for Doug and so as weve seen so many times before in hard-boiled crime movies the good-bad guy decides that after one last job hes out of the crooks life forever. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? It is never of course that simple. The Feds led by Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) are yapping at his heels; so is his closest friend and criminal accomplice Jem (Jeremy Renner) who is like a walking talking time bomb. (Renner played a bomb dismantler in Iraq in ""The Hurt Locker."" He might want to lighten up for his next role.)As a director Affleck doesnt overdo the Irishness of the Irish Catholic community of Charlestown and the actors dont overdo their accents. There are some marvelous cameo performances by Chris Cooper as Dougs convict father and Pete Postlethwaite as the scurviest florist-shop owner you will ever encounter.Affleck often underrated as an actor fits effortlessly into this milieu. With a less cliche-ridden script and fewer shootouts and chase scenes to pump up the temperature ""The Town"" might have amounted to something more than an occasionally good movie about crooks in trouble. Theres a knife-edge here but its been blunted. Grade B (Rated R for strong violence pervasive language some sexuality and drug use.)RELATED The Town Is Charlestown really Americas bank robbery capital?

Sporting a neat crew cut a sweat-glazed six-pack and a nice line in Boston-emblazoned tracksuit tops Affleck is Doug the conflicted leader of a rubber-masked wrecking crew who take down banks on behalf of kingpin (and florist) Pete Postlethwaite. Doug wants to take his loot and make a break for Florida a desire fuelled by his relationship with Rebecca Halls kindly soup-kitchen mama. But Petes got dirt on him and even though the Feds are closing in (led by Mad Men heartthrob John Hamm) the team keep breaking banks leading to a minutely orchestrated take-down of the Boston Red Soxs home ground.Youd hazard from this and his previous directorial effort Gone Baby Gone that Affleck counts Michael Mann and Sidney Lumet among his muses. Youd also guess from the films slickly calculated pacing and surfeit of soulful heart-to-hearts that break up the carnage that he has a fondness for the TV work of David Simon notably Homicide Life on the Street and The Wire. Yet despite the grubby locations in the Bostonian crime-hub of Charlestown the films credibility feels severely hamstrung by the fact that even though the robbers (especially Jeremy Renner as a gung-ho ex-con) are armed and dangerous too much effort is made to ensure us that its never nice-guy Affleck whos pulling the trigger.

Definitely worth the 2 hour watch.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 17 2013mploFeaturedI do not like the message that ""The Town"" conveys to me personally at all; that people dont have to be held accountable for what they do or the consequences of their actions and behaviors and that as long as people can get what they want it doesnt matter if other people are harmed in some way or other during the process. The stereotypes in this film are also quite prevalent; the mumbling slobbering shouting Red Sox-loving Bostonians that everybody in C-Town is either a bank robber or at least involved in the family business the law enforcement people assigned to the job of bringing guys like Doug MacRay and his men to justice are incompetent stupid jerks the slatternly drugged-out drunken ex-girlfriend of the gangleader (Krista) and the angel in human form framed by flowers who steals the heart of the same gangleader and has a complete breakdown when it backfires on her. (Claire Keesey the bank manager)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 15 2013mploFeaturedI really wanted Doug and his men to be caught tried charged and jailed for their crimes so I rooted for the FBI and SWAT the whole time in ""The Town. I also wanted Claire to either be criminally prosecuted herself or at least by put on probation for being an accessory to Doug MacRays crimes and for receiving stolen goods.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 15 2013mploFeaturedWhat most people (especially those who really fell head over heels for The Town) dont get about this particular movie is that Doug was a dangerous armed felon with an extensive criminal record who finally ended up going to Florida in the hopes of avoiding another prison term and couldnt take Claire with him to Florida as a bargaining chip in order to avoid prison as hed hoped to do which is why he left her behind. Furthermore Dougs phrase ""Ill see you again this side or the other"" at the end of his ""Ill always love you"" letter to Claire that he left her along with all the stolen money that she spent on the C-Town ice hockey rink was a euphemistic way of saying that theyd never meet again. How can so many people be stupid enough to believe that Claire would really go to Florida with him after all the crap that Doug pulled with her and the fact that he abused and took advantage of her. A smarter more street-wise woman than Claire wouldve had him pegged and figured out who Doug really was and what he was up to pretty much from the get-go or at least been much firmer about breaking it off with Doug for good no matter what anyone says or things.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 6 2013mploFeaturedAn overrated overly proclaimed film that conveys the message that anything goes as long as people can get away with it that its okay to become an accessory to criminal behavior and make utter dupes of law enforcement officials and obstruct justice when law enforcement people are trying to do their job of bringing dangerous criminals to justice revenge beatings and killings are legitimate and that its okay to spend stolen money on the renovation of a hockey rink instead of turning the stolen money over to the proper authorities under proper arrangement and finding more honest ways to procure the fundings for the hockey rink restoration. Claire was beyond stupid to set that alarm in the bank cause her co-worker to be beaten almost to death and to end up being taken as a hostage herself not to mention allowing herself to be totally taken advantage of by Doug MacRay a dangerous criminal who deserved to be put behind bars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 5 2013mploFeatured""The Town"" imho is a highly overrated movie thats more like a feature-length made-for-TV soap opera than a regular movie. Sure the beginning of ""The Town"" with the aerial/on the ground shots of Charlestown and Boston generally as well as the opening bank heist was interesting but except for the beginning the parts where the FBI are involved and the slatternly drugged-out Krista ""The Town"" on the whole was a rather junky rip-off of other heist films such as ""Heat"" ""Friends of Eddie Coyle"" and afew others. The Doug-Claire romance was rather paltry and immature at best and there shouldve been a lot less of it. The only sympathetic characters in the film imho are FBI Agt. Adam Frawley SWAT and the other law enforcement people who were assigned to bring Doug MacRay and his men to their knees and back to prison for their crimes. Claire Keesey imho lost my sympathy when she decided to stay in contact with Doug despite finally learning the truth about him through FBI Agt. Frawley accepted expensive gifts (a diamond necklace) from Doug tipped Doug off to the presence of the Feds in her house right when they were on the verge of nabbing him and sending him to prison for his crimes where he belonged thus helping to evade the law and spent blood-soaked stolen money that didnt belong to her on the renovation of the C-Town ice hockey rink instead of arranging to turn it over to the proper authorities. While it wasnt Claire Keeseys fault that her bank was robbed at gunpoint her choices and actions following the robbery put her in an extremely bad light.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 20 2012mploFeaturedFrankly I think that all the rave reviews that The Town got were bought and paid for. Theyre BS.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 29 2012andyFeaturedNot perfect by any means but still highly enjoyable and compelling.You do have to suspend your sense of disbelieve to some extent but a good script and quite compelling characters make up for that.And mploare you a policeman?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 14 2012mploFeaturedThe Town is a very cheesy and overrated. Its more like a feature-length made-for-TV soap opera than a regular movie. The cast is poor to mediocre at best and the immature teen-like Doug/Claire romance which takes up much too much of the film has no real believability or chemistry to it. The beginning of the film with the aerial shots of Charlestown and the opening bank heist was okay but within a matter of minutes this film went from being okay to just plain bad Its toitally unrealistic...come on..no woman in her right mind would meet a guy in a laundromat whod been following her for weeks accept a date with him and then stick with him after learning that he was the ringleader of the gang whod knocked over her bank and gunpoint and then kidnapped her. Thats so stupid it almost defies belief There are several things that most of the critics and average moviegoers alike seem to miss either out of naivete or willful ignorance A) Doug put the romance moves on Claire to make doubly sure that she didnt blow their cover by talking to the Feds. The movie convinces most people that Doug loved her but did he really? Nope. He was just out to exploit her as a bargaining chip because Doug is an armed felon and wanted fugitive. B) Doug had been following Claire for several weeks prior to him and his men knocking over her bank at gunpoint and kidnapping her. C) Doug ultimately skipped town for Florida first because he was on the lam from the law...not on vacation and secondly hed gotten what he really wanted out of Claire; a promise from her not to squeal to the Feds. Thirdly Doug knew at some level that his days of hiding out in Florida were numbered; hed eventually be hunted down caught (perhaps violently) and either sent to prison or gunned down by the Feds. I think that The Town wouldve been a better film with a better cast a tougher Claire instead of such a weepy angelic chick and an ending where Doug is sent to a federal penitentiary to serve long hard time for his crimes (i. e. armed robbery kidnapping and murder) and Claire had been criminally prosecuted herself or at least put on some sort of probation for abetting and protecting Doug by tipping him off to the Feds and generally protecting him with lies to the Feds and for receiving stolen goods (i. e. the money that Doug stole from the Fenway Park heist and left for Claire in her little community garden.)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 10 2011Henry ZakumumpaFeaturedOn the whole The Town is a worthy albeit forgettable 120 minutes at the Cineplex. Ben Affleck is on the other side of the lens directing but also playing a leading role in this heist movie. This is his second outing as a director after aEUR~Gone Baby GoneaEUR(tm). But this is a better product than his first outing. He is certainly getting better as a director and in some ways an actor as his directing is also a vehicle for his acting career. Unlike many movies I have seen in the past couple of months aEUR~The TownaEUR(tm) didnaEUR(tm)t get me dozing for a moment which says good things about the movie. aEUR~The TownaEUR(tm) is a movie set in Charlestown in Boston about a group of hard-knock childhood friends who get in the habit of robbing banks in their home town with flawless meticulous planning. This of course works most of the time but they have their waterloo on the horizon. Ben Affleck plays the brains of the bunch moderating his more overzealous group members. But he wants out to move to Florida with his new girlfriend (the manager of a bank he robs) and since this is no public service job where you can quit at liberty all with whom he is in cahoots with have something to say about that. If you want to breathtaking car chases daring bank robberies tension and suspense and even a laugh The TownaEUR(tm) is your cup of tea. You have to occasionally suspend your disbelief as there a couple of scenes that will stretch your imagination or the scale of believability.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 3 2011Justin BerkoviFeaturedOnce again I find myself at odds with Time Outs critics and I think this will be the last time I use the site as a reference point for accurate critique of cinema. The Town is a solid and enjoyable film and I disagree totally with it being labelled flat. The entire film kept me on edge wondering how it was going to pan out and hats off to Affleck directing and acting in this. Heat being one of my favourite films of the genre is a (flawed) masterpiece that would be very difficult to match in terms of atmosphere but thats the entire point. The people here are not the well heeled elite of the underworld but merely townies trying to get by doing something their way.

This is a gritty cops and robbers story where you know the lead character is actually a pretty bad guy but still likeable enough that you really kinda hope he gets the girl and away with it. Thats not an easy balance but Affleck pulls it off. Whether he was trying to do this or not he also put me in mind of Boston in the bad old ""Whitey Bulger"" gangster days when people knew who was who but everybody kept their mouths shut.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 17 2010 1230 PM Boston. Boston. Boston. Ben Affleck. Dont say I didnt warn you about The Town. By Dana Stevens After youve seen The Town check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunesor directly with our RSS feed. Ben Affleck as Doug MacRay and Chris Cooper as Stephen MacRay in The Town An autopsy for The Town (Warner Bros.) would list multiple causes of death. Ben Afflecks second directorial outing after Gone Baby Gone also marks his first time directing himself a notoriously difficult trick to pull off. Next theres the laudable but misguided scope of the movies ambition Affleck tries to cram a heist thriller a buddy movie and a wrong-side-of-the-tracks romance into one sweeping two-hour-plus epic. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. What ultimately kills The Town though is the notion that Ben Affleck is a criminal mastermind a bank-robbing prodigy with a crack team of thugs at his command. We dont want Affleck the mastermind we want Affleck the meathead. (His greatest role to date Slate culture editor John Swansburg and I agree in the Spoiler Special podcast for this review is still OBannion the wooden-paddle-wielding high-school bully in Dazed and Confused.) If the two male leads in this movie had switched places--Jeremy Renner as the brains of the holdup gang Affleck as his dim sadistic right-hand man--the story might conceivably have worked (though given Afflecks limited resources as a thespian the optimum solution would have been for Renner to play both roles.) Advertisement The Town kicks off with a high-octane if not entirely coherent action sequence as a team of armed men in masks knocks over a Boston bank branch. In the confusion of the getaway they decide for some reason to take the young manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) hostage then let her go that same afternoon. After the woman tells her story to an FBI agent (Don Draper pardon Jon Hamm) the gangs loose cannon Jem (Renner) offers to track down the manager and ""take care of her."" Cooler-headed Doug (Affleck) assures Jem that all she needs is a good scare. So he trails the victim to a Laundromat. But when she tearfully confesses that shes had a hard week Doug does a 180-degree turn. Instead of identifying himself as the robber and threatening her with imminent bodily harm if she doesnt keep her trap shut he asks her out for a drink. The romance that ensues a yuppie bank manager falling for the charms of the working-class bank robber is the movies single most un-buyable element (and believe me theres some competition in this department). Its not that a relationship couldnt spark across these class lines but we have to be given some reason why either of these two parties would want it to. More fundamentally the deception at the heart of Doug and Claires courtship makes it impossible to root for this couple. (""Its a shame things got started on the wrong foot with that whole armed robbery/kidnapping thing but I really hope these kids can make it work"") Other occasions for incredulity include an elaborate heist in Fenway Park. The movie is almost aggressively regional with establishing shots of the Bunker Hill monument every 15 minutes (what no closeup of a bowl of chowder?). The ""town"" of this movies title is not Boston as a whole but Charlestown an isolated one-square-mile former Irish enclave that while its now gentrifying has a history as the nations prime breeding ground for bank robbers. Affleck clearly loves his hometown and according to my native Bostonian viewing partner he wasnt overdoing the Cliff Clavin working-class accent. When hes not relying on aerial shots Affleck does dig up a few choice Charlestown locations rundown community youth centers a corner barbershop the kind of nameless Irish bars where nothing good ever happens. Hurt Locker hype aside Jeremy Renner legitimately qualifies as an exciting new actor (by which I mean new to the public consciousness--hes been acting for more than a decade). Hes just somehow thrilling to watch even though as Jem he doesnt get to do much more than go down in flames Public Enemies-style. Rebecca Hall--Vicky of Vicky Cristina Barcelona--is one of those high-strung transparent beauties whose every thought flickers across her face. Like Jennifer Connelly shes fun just to stare at; watching her expression change is like watching water. But Affleck--look I understand that there are people who find him a congenial screen presence though I dont number among them. Even so lets not kid ourselves about his acting. In a picnic scene with his abduction-victim-turned-girlfriend Doug relates the story of his mothers disappearance when he was 6. As he delivers his soliloquy its easy to picture the lines marked in yellow highlighter on Afflecks copy of the script ""The first thing I remember is the sound [beat]."" More problematic than Afflecks acting though is the picnic scene itself which exists in order to show us that poor struggling disadvantaged Doug is finally opening up and telling the truth to someone. Maybe instead of the childhood anecdote he could have started with ""Hey you know that guy who blindfolded you at gunpoint and threw you into a van? Funny story. ..."" Like Slate on Facebook.

Bank robber Doug (Ben Affleck) falls for a bank manager (Rebecca Hall) in The Town. Photo WARNER BROS. PICTURES The Town 1 / 1 Back to Gallery I was never a Ben Affleck hater. Never. I always liked the guy even when I hated his movies even when vehicles like Pearl Harbor swallowed him in bloat. Beneath all those suffocating layers of stardom was a darn smart filmmaker gasping for air. Four years ago he poked his head up as a melancholic George Reeves in Hollywoodland. Then came his feature directorial debut Gone Baby Gone a hard-boiled movie about scuzzy doings in Beantown. Which brings us to The Town another gritty Boston drama with a crime-thriller plot and one more reason for Affleck-bashers to just hush up. Once again he directed co-produced and co-wrote the script but this time he cast himself in the lead. On all four fronts he proves his mettle turning out a first-class genre entry stacked with dandy performances and some crackerjack action to boot. Adapted from Chuck Hogans novel Prince of Thieves The Town is named for Charlestown a neighborhood thats given birth to more bank robbers and armored-car thieves than anywhere else in the world. (So were told in the opening credits; at the close were informed that nice folk live there too.) Its the third such movie to hit theaters in recent weeks -- after Animal Kingdom which you should see and Takers which you shouldnt. As usual the bandits in question run around in masks (first theyre Skeletors then theyre nuns). And as usual an ashen cloud of romantic doom follows their every move. You just know one of thems going to fall in love. One of thems going to have a short fuse. One of thems going to tire of the life and dream of getting out. The Townsticks to convention. Affleck plays Doug the one who falls in love in this case with a bank manager (Rebecca Hall) he helps abduct during the films opening heist. Jeremy Renner plays Jem the one with the short fuse - just out of prison. (One of thems always just out of prison.) Between this and his Oscar-nominated performance inThe Hurt Locker Renner is now the actor of choice for heavily armed post-traumatic cork-popping. Theres a grim legitimacy to his despair that gives weight to a formulaic role. The same goes for Gossip Girls Blake Lively slurry-voiced heavy-lidded and borderline unrecognizable as Jems drug-addled sister. Also on hand are Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite as Dougs scummy unrepentant pa and a gnarly old numbers-runner respectively. (Less memorable through no fault of his own is Jon Hamm as the usual FBI agent barking the usual orders.) But The Towns real star is the Hub its historic streets are utilized in all their convoluted glory for shoot-outs and chase scenes filmed with competent hustle. Theres a touch of agitation in Robert Ellswits camerawork enough to lend an edge of rough-trade authenticity to the proceedings - but not enough to make you seasick. Afflecks direction is clipped when the plot requires but he lingers on character-driven scenes (at a garden a restaurant a corner) in no apparent rush. Why hurry after all?

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 17 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Town Directed by Ben Affleck Written by Ben Affleck Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard Starring Ben Affleck Jeremy Renner Jon Hamm and Rebecca Hall Classification 14A The town that is the subject of Ben Afflecks second feature is the mainly Irish Boston neighbourhood of Charlestown which as the opening onscreen text tells us has produced more bank- and armoured-car robberies than any place in the world in what amounts to a kind of family and community tradition. Like Martin Scorseses The Departed or James Grays We Own the Night The Town is a deliberately old-fashioned melodrama that echoes the pulpy mix of violence and romanticism of gangster films of the Thirties and Forties. The story based on Chuck Hogans 2004 novel Prince of Thieves gives Affleck his second opportunity (after Gone Baby Gone) to create a set of colourful characters in a grittily distinct environment. Affleck plays Doug MacRay the brains behind a four-man crew who hit banks and armoured cars carrying automatic weapons and dressed in needlessly theatrical costumes. After pulling off the bank heist that opens the movie MacRay and his friends discover that the bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) who they briefly took hostage lives in the gentrified part of their neighbourhood. Doug assigns himself the role of getting closer to her to find out what she knows and also to keep his hot-headed second in command Jem (Jeremy Renner of The Hurt Locker) from trying to shut her up permanently. Doug finds a way to meet her at the neighbourhood laundromat and despite the cultural gap - hes a hulking thug with tattoos and a thick ""Bahstun"" accent; shes an educated yuppie who helps poor kids at the community centre - they immediately start an affair. Can Dougs redemption be far away? The romance proves something of a weak centre in the film because the affair seems less driven by erotic charge than mutual pity. Her little brother died on a sunny day; his mom disappeared when he was 6 and later he blew a pro-hockey chance. Somehow the love affair becomes the impetus for Dougs efforts in the films second half to get out of his neighbourhood and change his life though not before a couple of high-risk heists that involve more theatrical costumes and logistical complexities. All this seems like a custom opportunity for Affleck to demonstrate that as well as a student of neighbourhood-rooted machismo he has become a good action director. Its an enthusiasm that he overindulges for long stretches of well-choreographed car chases and automatic weapons-spattering exchanges. The best work comes from a series of one-on-one character scenes especially the macho standoffs. The most volatile presence is that of Renners Jem (Jeremy Renner who already proved in The Hurt Locker is a master of understated tension). For all the gunplay and chases the most suspenseful scene in the film occurs when Jem suddenly drops in on Doug and Claire as theyre eating lunch. Jems sister and Dougs former lover is the promiscuous drugged-out Krista ( Gossip Girls Blake Lively with smudgy eyeliner and slurry delivery) and too obviously an opposite to the upscale Claire. Doug tries to appeal to the neighbourhood crime boss Fergus Colm (Pete Postlethwaite) the gatekeeper in this particular neighbourhood hell who operates out of a florist shop. Postlethwaites onscreen time is packed with theatrical monkey business - an eye-popping flower-chopping tongue-clucking display in full-Irish brogue - a performance somewhere between hypnotic and risible. At the other end of the spectrum the real knock-out performance belongs to Chris Cooper as Dougs incarcerated father who exudes such an aura of emptiness beyond despair you imagine his voice could curdle milk. Jon Hamm as the FBI agent Adam Frawley does an adroit job in the police briefing sessions. But it probably was a mistake to make him come across as ruthless as the crooks especially in the tit-for-tat showdown with Doug. Hamm makes his this-is-how-youre-going-down speech to Doug which sounds like he stayed up all night writing it. After an insolent pause Doug responds with his this-is-how-Im-smarter-than-you speech which feels as contrived as the dialogue Affleck and Matt Damon wrote for Good Will Hunting 13 years ago at an age when they could be forgiven for juvenile excesses. Though it moves fast when it moves The Town feels long especially when Hall and Affleck are left moping onscreen together. The ending is also weak - sentimental morally unjustified and lacking in emotional punch - but this is not a negligible movie just one thats not quite at the level of Michael Mann who seems to be the model here. To his credit Affleck has planted stakes in two camps here a stylized neighbourhood melodrama with some compelling performance moments and a credible heist flick.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Ben Afflecks follow-up to his gritty directorial debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" proves the actor/director/co-writer is here baby here to stay. His charged heist flick ""The Town"" stalls some on the back end. Still it struts an appreciation for acting place and the power of flicks to engage viscerally and intelligently. The robbers-and-cop drama set in Bostons Charlestown neighborhood plunges into the action with as much vigor as the gang that bursts into a bank brandishing assault rifles wearing skeleton masks barking threats. Its well-orchestrated chaos. Robert Elswits camera mimics the fierce energy. When things get testy we share in the fear inflicted on unlucky customers bank employees and bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall). Affleck does front-of-the-camera duty as Doug MacRay brains of the successful and increasingly bold gang of four. His second is his childhood friend his ex- girlfriends brother and a loose cannon. Played by Jeremy Renner (the go-it-alone bomb expert in ""The Hurt Locker"") James Coughlin is an improvising explosive character. The movie establishes early and in rather old fashion the difference between Doug and his volatile buddy. In a word conscience. Armored car guards are working stiffs not paid enough to be heroic Doug tells his cohort. James counters ominously ""If they want to get hurt dont get in the way."" Affleck and his co-writers (Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) adapted Chuck Hogans novel ""Prince of Thieves."" With a title like that Dougs chivalry is wired into the narrative. Hes not a killer. Later when he enlists James in an act of impulsive gallantry the outcome serves only as a reminder of how far apart morally he and James have grown over the years. ""Gossip Girl"" Blake Lively plays Krista Coughlin Dougs former girlfriend with a damaged mercenary sexuality. ""The Town"" is also a romantic drama. A subterfuge turns into a delicate courtship between Doug and Claire. She doesnt know that the strong-jawed yet gentle guy is one of the men who traumatized her. There are a few wry winks as Doug and the audience share in the knowledge of their first encounter. Hall brings a smart reserve and believable need for a protector to Claire. But the heist movie is better than the love story. Even a guy called ""the florist"" -- owner of a flower shop played with spooky quiet by Pete Postlethwaite -- intimidates. Throughout ""The Town"" FBI Agent Adam Frawley hunts the crew. Portrayed by ""Mad Men"" star Jon Hamm hes fully capable of busting heads and bending rules. ""The Town"" works to keep our allegiance wandering the gray zones. Frawley is a little too angry to be wholly likable. And Doug the son of a career criminal (Chris Cooper in finely chilly prison scenes) is too sensitive to condemn. A textured atmosphere distinguished ""Gone Baby Gone."" (So did Afflecks ability to craft a showcase for younger brother Caseys talents.) A similar love of place courses though ""The Town."" A caveat in the production notes suggests how respectful Affleck wants to be of his beloved Beantown ""Charlestowns reputation as a breeding ground for armed robbers is authentic. However this film all but ignores the great majority of the residents of Charlestown past and present who are the same good and true people found almost anywhere. This film is dedicated to them."" Though the movie goes a bit long and sentimental its this fondness for a place and its denizens that makes ""The Town"" honorable and a cut above. ""the town"" R for strong violence pervasive language some sexuality and drug use. 2 hours 10 minutes.

That one is Doug MacRay played by director Affleck. Assigned to keep an eye on a bank robbery witness (Rebecca Hall) he makes the mistake of falling for her instead.Set in the Boston bank-robbing hub of Charlestown and based on Chuck Hogans novel Prince of Thieves The Town is the kind of vivid genre piece that Hollywood could stand to make a lot more of. As in Afflecks directorial debut Gone Baby Gone the sense of place leaps off the screen. The character and performances including Jeremy Renner as Dougs lieutenant and Pete Postlethwaite as the gangs quietly evil behind-the-scenes boss are fully lived-in. The action sequences especially a key car chase and a climactic shootout at Fenway Park have speed and heft.The romance at The Towns core doesnt quite sizzle like the fierce tribalism that drives the criminals; if theres a tragic love story here its between Doug the leader who comes to see a better way of life and his crew which lives by a blood bond of loyalty. Affleck and Renner have a classic scene outside a cemetery that lays down the high stakes. Jon Hamm as the FBI agent chasing the crew also gets a moment to shine when he charms Dougs spiteful ex a townie looking for her next fix into betrayal.The Town doesnt reinvent the wheel. It just does what it does with great conviction and a sky-high level of execution. It also forges ahead with one of the best Hollywood second-act stories in recent memory.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter chrisvognar.Director Ben AffleckStarring Ben Affleck Rebecca Hall Jeremy Renner Jon Hamm Chris Cooper and Pete PostlethwaiteRun time 130 minutesMPAA rating R (strong violence pervasive language some sexuality and drug use) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

With no real attachments Doug never has to fear losing anyone close to him. But that all changed on the gangs latest job when they briefly took a hostage -- bank manager Claire Keesey. They let her go unharmed but sometime later she meets an unassuming and rather charming man named Doug... not realizing that he is the same man who only days earlier had terrorized her. Starring Ben Affleck Rebecca Hall Jon Hamm Jeremy Renner Blake Lively Titus Welliver Pete Postlethwaite Chris Cooper Director Ben Affleck Running time 203 Release Opened Sep 17 2010  Editorial Review Affleck proves hes moving in the right directionBy Ann HornadayFriday September 17 2010Ben Affleck made a quietly astonishing directorial debut a few years ago with the taut atmospheric mystery ""Gone Baby Gone."" With ""The Town"" he proves hes no one-hit wonder. A big ambitious action crime thriller ""The Town"" trades the earlier films contemplative mournful mood for a faster pace and smashing set pieces. Its a smart bold genre exercise thats enormous fun to watch harking back to gritty urban thrillers of the 1970s with an assured sense of tone and style. Adopting the directors prerogative Affleck has cast himself in ""The Towns"" lead role of Doug MacRay a native of Bostons tough Irish Charlestown neighborhood which as an opening title card informs us has produced more bank and armored car robberies than any place in the United States. Doug and his best friend Jem (Jeremy Renner) are lifelong members of one of Charlestowns most notorious and successful crews a team that methodically goes about its thuggish business with a combination of workaday professionalism and swift vicious violence. When the guys rob a bank and take a manager hostage the episode sparks a series of events that leads Doug to question whether hes ready to leave Charlestowns tribal life of murder and mayhem. Meanwhile hes being pursued by an FBI agent (Jon Hamm) whos determined to make the choice for him. Let it be noted that ""The Town"" based on the novel ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan doesnt break any narrative ground. Dougs sensitive bad guy contemplating one last job before he goes clean evokes countless Hollywood cliches (the most recent iteration being George Clooneys soulful assassin in ""The American""). But if Affleck is all too willing to make his character a too-good-to-be-true paragon of moral ambivalence he still manages to infuse Dougs struggle with touches of recognizable realism especially by way of the characters he surrounds himself with. Renner whose breakout performance in ""The Hurt Locker"" last year earned him a deserved Oscar nod brings a similar brand of volatile energy to the borderline psychotic Jem whose filial loyalty Doug both appreciates and abhors. Rebecca Hall as the bank manager the boys abduct brings a welcome note of understated grace to an otherwise testosterone-driven exercise in male bonding and fraternal rituals. (Blake Lively has a few juicy scenes as Jems hard-living sister reminiscent of Amy Ryans indelible anti-heroine in ""Gone Baby Gone."") As in his earlier film Affleck evinces a keen eye and ear for the Boston neighborhoods near where he grew up in nearby Cambridge; his command of the areas vernacular and milieu allow ""The Town"" to take its rightful place next to ""Mystic River"" and ""The Departed"" as a muscular and authentic Beantown flick. With its heists fights car chases and kick-in-the-pants climax set at Fenway Park ""The Town"" lets action staging and canny editing tell the story. ""The Town"" has a lot going for it terrific cast good writing some nifty psychological reversals. But the best news is that Affleck makes it all move.Contains strong violence pervasive profanity sexuality and drug use.

The Town (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Town (R) Cops and robbers told with heart and gravitas Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald9/16/2010 Editor rating 3 The title of The Town is short for Charlestown a largely Irish working-class Boston suburb where robbery is the most prevalent family trade. By day men such as Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) hold down jobs as construction workers shop keepers and mailmen. But during their off hours many of them carry out brazen bank and armored-car heists often in broad daylight because theyre so good at what they do and because crime is practically built into their DNA. Theyve been around it all their lives. They just cant help themselves. The story of The Town which is based on Chuck Hogans novel Prince of Thieves follows what happens when Doug has a crisis of conscience after falling for Claire (Rebecca Hall) a bank manager his gang briefly took hostage during their last job. Claire has no idea Doug is one of the masked men who blindfolded and kidnapped (but didnt harm) her and shes charmed by his blunt yet gentle nature. She soothes the beast in him and offers him a glimpse of a lifestyle hes never even considered. But Dougs roots in the neighborhood are deep. His father (Chris Cooper) a loveless prickly man is serving five life sentences in prison. His best friend and right-hand man James (Jeremy Renner) has a violent temper and a loose trigger finger. And although Doug tries to limit the extent of his crimes - he doesnt believe in shooting cops and orders his crew to aim for the patrol cars engine blocks instead - things sometimes go awry with bloody results. The Town marks a huge step up in scope and ambition for director Affleck whose previous film Gone Baby Gone was a detective story driven mostly by character and dialogue. The Town has several big action set pieces including an exciting car chase through a maze of impossibly narrow streets and a tremendous shoot out at Fenway Park where the robbers seriously outnumbered by cops resort to ingenious tactics to attempt a clean getaway. These men are intelligent and crafty which makes catching them a lot more difficult for the FBI agent (Jon Hamm) on their trail. The Town does a good job of conveying life in a neighborhood so tough that children are practically raised to be criminals (Pete Postlewaithe is terrific as the worlds meanest florist). Afflecks smooth elegant directorial style is strong reminiscent of Clint Eastwoods He takes his time establishing characters who are far more complex than they initially appear then thrusts them into moral dilemmas with no easy outs. And like most actors who direct Affleck pays careful attention to the performances populating this familiar scenario with doomed flawed people whose messed-up lives are fascinating to watch. You just wouldnt want to live anywhere near them. Cast Ben Affleck Rebecca Hall Jeremy Renner Jon Hamm Blake Lively Pete Postlewaithe Chris Cooper. Director Ben Affleck.

Sony Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Sept. 17 2010 1201 a.m. ET Theres a wonderful line in ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" when Elliott and his older brother Michael head off to their classes leaving E.T. behind at home. ""Did you explain school to him?"" Michael asks. ""How do you explain school to higher intelligence?"" Elliott replies. He has a point. Secondary classrooms are what most of us dreamed of escaping from and the longer were out of high school the less receptive we become to high school comedies. Why then am I so pleased with ""Easy A""? Because the movie despite a few flaws seems to have been made by higher intelligence and because it catapults Emma Stone into a higher place reserved for American actors who can handle elevated language with casually dazzling aplomb. Watch a clip of ""Easy A"" featuring Emma Stone and Penn Badgley. Courtesy Sony/Screen Gems. She plays Olive Penderghast an Ojai Calif. high-school student who goes to class in a bustier emblazoned with the scarlet A of an adulteress. How she reaches this point is a convoluted story and a long way from the 1980s comedies of John Hughes; suffice it to say that Olive identifies intensely with Hester Prynne the outcast heroine of ""The Scarlet Letter."" A more immediate question is how Ms. Stone barely out of her own teens reached that higher place so quickly; the answer involves the twin mysteries of talent and growth. Three years ago she made a splashlet as Jules the alluring party girl in ""Superbad."" In last years stylish ""Zombieland"" she was sexy and confident as the larcenous Wichita. Neither of those performances though could have predicted her emergence as a full-fledged movie star. With her agile features Cognac voice and Spritely spirit she makes Olive an embodiment of young sophistication. ""Easy A"" was directed with fearless exuberance by Will Gluck from an elated and elating screenplay by Bert V. Royal. Like Amy Heckerlings ""Clueless"" which drew its inspiration from Jane Austens ""Emma"" this new film is an unrestrained riff on the Nathaniel Hawthorne novel. And like Ms. Heckerlings update the enterprise revels in quasiliterary language. In a preteen flashback Olive tries to reassure an anxious boy ""Dont worry Im not as smart as I think I am."" In fact shes delightfully smart and so is the movie; its bon mots are consistently bon. One of my favorites predates Olives notoriety ""Google Earth couldnt find me if I was dressed up as a 10-story building."" The other follows her emergence as a harlot--a faux-harlot more precisely ""I always thought pretending to lose my virginity would be a little more special. Judy Blume should have prepared me for that."" Olives pretense is the mainspring--or hair-trigger--of the plot. From the moment she tells a girlfriend about an imagined liaison with a nonexistent college student theres no calling back the instant messages or quelling the scandal. Among the things ""Easy A"" manages to be smart about is the madcap virulence of social networks and witty snippets of a webcast provide the narrative structure--theyre Olives effort to explain what she did as opposed to what she kept saying she did and why she did it. One interesting issue the production raises is whether kids will want to see it. I hope they do but it remains to be seen if the ""Im like and shes like"" and ""I go then he goes"" generation can handle the rich dialogue. Another is whether the movies look will militate against its success I accepted the indifferent cinematography as an almost certain sign of a low budget that didnt allow for careful setups or meticulous lighting. According to the story most high-school boys are either virgins or gay; that might prompt some challenges on empirical grounds. So might the unconditional support that Olive enjoys from her blissed-out parents. (Theyre played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci and I cherished every preposterous moment they were on screen.) Still another issue flows from the unfortunate tradition of comedy let alone high-school comedy not always getting the respect it deserves. This one largely thanks to Ms. Stones role in it deserves more than respect ""Easy A"" earns adulation for originality hilarity and verve. ENLARGE Keira Knightley Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield in Never Let Me Go. Fox Searchlight Never Let Me Go For its delicate tone provocative themes impeccable craftsmanship and superb performances--by Carey Mulligan Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley--""Never Let Me Go"" earned my great admiration. I wish Id been affected in equal measure but I wasnt and its not the sort of film you can will yourself to enjoy even though you know that many others will be moved by its tale of romance class oppression and harsh destiny. More Mark Romanek on Videos Vs. Movies Carey Mulligan on Never Let Me Go Never Let Me Go Review Revue This adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguros novel was directed by Mark Romanek from a screenplay by Alex Garland. The book was an exceedingly slow reveal. Ever so gradually did it let the reader know that a key setting an English boarding school called Hailsham in the 1970s was part of an alternate sci-fi universe not unrelated to such classic dystopias as ""Soylent Green."" Ever so gradually did the schools ostensible students discover that they were carefully nurtured clones who would die after donating their organs to long-lived residents of an England they were barely aware of. See a clip of ""Never Let Me Go."" Based on the book by Kazuo Ishiguro ""Never Let Me Go"" stars Keira Knightley and rising British stars Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield. Courtesy Fox Searchlight. Im revealing these plot points here only because in recent interviews both the director and the novelist have approved of doing so. As they see it the potential for surprise has dwindled to nil since the book was published five years ago while a knowledge of the premise will enhance our appreciation of the characters plight and deepen our involvement in the intertwined subjects--what it means to be human and what inhumanities may be committed in the name of science. Theyre right on both counts. Its fascinating--or haunting if your mind can defer to your heart--to watch the trio at the center of the story work their way through love betrayal and reconciliation to a poignant peace with their fate. Ms. Mulligans performance in particular is a quiet triumph thanks to the dissonance between her characters dire circumstances and her gift for expressing wordless expectancy. Charlotte Rampling is chillingly effective as Hailshams stern headmistress and Sally Hawkins distinguishes herself in the small but pivotal role of a teacher who teaches kids the truth. If only the film had offered some relief from all that poignancy and resignation. Not comedy certainly nor even rebelliousness since thats ruled out by fidelity to the literary source but brighter sparks of life than the emotional spectrum contained. ""Never Let Me Go"" hardly allowed me a scintilla of hope. ENLARGE Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner in The Town. Warner Bros. Pictures The Town Ben Affleck works both sides of the camera to impressive effect in ""The Town"" a dramatic thriller that fulfills its considerable ambitions. As the director he showcases fine performances without indulging in showboating and illuminates character without losing a beat of the throbbing pace; this movie represents a big step forward from his solid directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone."" (The shrewd taut script was adapted by Peter Craig Mr. Affleck and Aaron Stockard from a novel by Chuck Hogan.) As the star he gives one of those fine performances though its an artistic toss-up between his intensity and Rebecca Halls lovely simplicity. The town of the title is Charlestown a blue-collar Boston neighborhood thats described by a wry opening title as having spawned more robbers of banks and armored trucks than any other place in the nation. Mr. Afflecks Doug MacRay robs banks. He and his crew usually rob them before business hours while their doors are open to receive money from armored trucks. When one robbery goes wrong they take the branch manager hostage--Ms. Halls Claire Keesey--and an unlikely yet engrossing relationship develops between her and Doug. Claire doesnt know who he is since he and the others wore masks and Doug doesnt know how to keep from falling in love with her. Watch a clip of ""The Town"" starring Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall. Courtesy Warner Bros. You cant blame him. Sweeping away the cliches of her character--the naivete the vulnerability the neediness--Ms. Hall creates a woman whose keen intelligence is exceeded only by her yearning for a new life with the man she has just met. (The intelligence of the writing is best exemplified by a pair of lines that turn on the phrase ""sunny day."") Doug wants a new life too but escaping his family history is more easily yearned for than achieved. That registers most powerfully during a brief prison visit with his father Stephen (Chris Cooper) whos not only behind bars but beyond reach in a permanent state of rage. More Jeremy Renner on Blake Lively and Boston Accents Romain Duris on Dirty Dancing with Johnny Depps partner As a thriller ""The Town"" has what it takes and then some an electrifying performance by Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") as Dougs lethally volatile partner in crime; riveting work by Jon Hamm as a remorseless FBI agent; strong acting in supporting roles by Blake Lively and Pete Postlethwaite; percussive car chases through central Bostons narrow streets. And the romantic element though subordinate to the action rings equally true. When Doug says ""Ill see you in Florida kid"" you wont mistake him for a violent dreamer played by James Cagney but youll still root for him with as well as against your better judgment. Heartbreaker ""Heartbreaker"" in French with English subtitles is total fluff though its totality is reasonably agreeable and Pascal Chaumeils comedy cum scenery--mainly Monte Carlo--gives the mercurial Romain Duris a chance to show his chops as an homme fatal. He plays Alex a professional seducer who with two other members of a team thats supposed to parody Mission Impossible gets paid to break up bad relationships. (At least the people who pay him think theyre bad.) Vanessa Paradis is Juliette a headstrong playgirl in a relationship that doesnt seem to need breaking up. The movie can be arch and awfully strenuous especially when an obnoxious nymphomaniac named Sophie invades the premises. But heres a chance to measure its arch before the inevitable advent of an American remake. DVD FOCUS Juno (2007) ENLARGE If youve seen Ellen Page in this word feast written by Diablo Cody its impossible not to think of her when youre watching Emma Stone in ""Easy A."" Which movie is better? Which actress is quicker-lipped? Thats a moot point and an irrelevant one. The important thing is that these splendid comedies and their gifted stars deserve one anothers company. ""Im a legend"" says the pregnant Juno MacGuff wryly when her condition grows all too visible. But the film directed by Jason Reitman is not a cautionary tale. Its a comedy of crisp mordant wit and quietly radiating warmth. An Education (2009) ENLARGE Was it only last year that this tale of an English schoolgirls hard-won wisdom made Carey Mulligan an international star? She plays the precocious and perilously tender Jenny who at 16 finds the London of 1961--one year before Beatlemania--sedate if not downright sedative. Peter Sarsgaard is David a man of the world who offers her the prospect of an education that isnt covered by the syllabus of her private school. Alfred Molina is her father Jack as craven a social climber as John Cleeses Basil in ""Fawlty Towers."" Lone Scherfig directed from Nick Hornbys script. The Departed (2006) ENLARGE Martin Scorseses crime drama takes place within Bostons city limits but it seems to have been made in a state of exultation and holds you captive in a state of dark delight. The basic idea was inspired by ""Infernal Affairs"" a 2002 action thriller from Hong Kong and a classic of sorts. But ""The Departed"" has become a classic in its own right thanks in no small measure to William Monahans script and to a cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson Matt Damon Vera Farmiga Mark Wahlberg Ray Winstone Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. Michael Ballhaus did the cinematography.

Pictures via AP Flirting with danger Bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) starts off as Dougs (Ben Affleck) hostage but quickly becomes his love interest. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Town   1/2 (out of four)Stars Ben Affleck Rebecca Hall Jon Hamm Blake Lively Jeremy RennerDirector Ben AffleckDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for strong violence pervasive language some sexuality and drug useRunning time 2 hours 3 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Apparently Thomas Wolfe was not altogether right. Some people can go home again. And its our gain when they do. Ben Affleck is one of those people. The actor/director again explores his Boston hometown in a steadily tense action thriller/romance based on Chuck Hogans novel. In 2007s Gone Baby Gone Affleck told a troubling mesmerizing story starring his brother Casey Affleck and Amy Ryan. The Town is a more traditional tale of a criminal subculture following a group of thuggish friends in the blue-collar Boston neighborhood of Charlestown the armed robbery capital of the USA. The story also delves into what happens when one of them tries to rise above the muck he was born into. TRAILER Take a quick visit to The Town TORONTO FILM FEST Get all the latest updates INTERVIEW Blake Lively is talk of The Town The film opens with a terrifying bank heist -- augmented by the haunting combination of ghoulish masks and nuns habits. The sequence grabs hold of the audience and keeps us in its thrall but the films grip slackens as it winds to its conclusion. Some of the best crime dramas in recent years have been set in Boston Clint Eastwoods Mystic River (2003) Martin Scorseses The Departed (2006) and Gone Afflecks directorial debut. He couldnt be in better company. And based on just his two directorial efforts Affleck may be en route to similar master-filmmaker status. Just think Gigli came out in 2003. Since then his resilience and commitment to overcoming missteps is impressive. Affleck plays Doug the criminal son of a prison inmate (Chris Cooper). He has a nominal day job with a gravel company but mostly hes involved in illicit activities with his best pal Jem (Jeremy Renner) at the direction of the local crime boss (a menacing Pete Postlethwaite) with an ultra-benign cover as a florist. Their stunts mostly include bank jobs. During a big robbery Doug takes a nervous bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) hostage. From then on their vastly different worlds are enmeshed. Its easy to see why Doug is drawn to Claire who represents a shot at redemption. She works in a community garden and has a serene sunny personality. Shes the polar opposite of the tough chicks Doug knows from the hood particularly Krista (Blake Lively) the single mom with an OxyContin addiction and an emotional addiction to Doug. Dogged FBI Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) is on Doug and Jems trail perhaps just steps from nabbing them. And hes keeping his steely gaze on Claire the robberys key witness. Affleck has a keen eye for cinematic stories and wisely chooses ones set in a city he knows intimately. He has an evident knack for orchestrating intensely involving action scenes. He also has returned to form as a leading man. The Hurt Lockers Renner is excellent as a Cagney-flavored hothead. Hall exudes confident intelligence. Lively effectively plays against her glossy image. Though the narrative is a conventional one the well-acted suspenseful story deals in fascinatingly murky morality and mines intriguing material from a historic and complex city.

"Town The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; town-the ) Town The (United States 2010) September 15 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli In some ways The Town can be considered a throwback at least insomuch as any movie reflecting the approach of 80s and 90s cop dramas can be tagged with such a label. With a crisp clear style and a focus on character director Ben Affleck is able to imbue staple action scenes with a sense of urgency and tension. Take for example what could be a routine car chase. Because of the way its shot the viewer finds himself unexpectedly caught up in the excitement. On paper the scene might be generic; on screen its more than that. The same can be said about many elements of The Town. The pieces and parts assembled herein are familiar but the manner in which Affleck puts them together results in an engrossing two hours of cinema. Few will depart from a showing of The Town overwhelmed but neither will they be dissatisfied by the experience. The movie like Afflecks previous directorial outing Gone Baby Gone takes place in Boston - in the Charlestown section to be precise. This time however Affleck is directing himself rather than his brother. His double duty (triple actually since he is credited as a co-writer adapting from Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan) hasnt impacted the skill with which the production has been assembled. During his years in front of the camera Affleck has studied those helming his various productions and those lessons have paid dividends. From an opening caption we learn that Charlestown is a place where bank robbery is passed from generation to generation like any trade. Indeed the main character Doug MacRay (Affleck) is from such a family. His father Stephen (Chris Cooper) is serving multiple life sentences for murders associated with a robbery gone bad. Stephens three best friends - James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) Gloansy Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) - are members of his crew. Doug is the brains of the operation and Coughlin who served nine years in prison for murder is a loose cannon capable of turning violent and unpredictable at any moment. Thats what happens during their latest job when he brutally beats a man he suspects of having triggered the silent alarm and takes the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. She is subsequently released and never sees their unmasked faces but when Doug tracks her down later to ascertain whether she has knowledge that could help the cops identify him he finds himself attracted to her. Meanwhile the FBI is on the job. Led by a driven hard-nosed special agent named Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) they are determined to put an end to the crime spree. They suspect the identities of the four responsible individuals but dont have enough proof to make arrests let alone get convictions. So Frawley must engage in some old-fashioned detective work do some surveillance and resort to a little bullying. What hes really waiting for however is another robbery - one where he can be a step ahead of Dougs gang and catch them in the act. The Towns drama and energy comes from two sources the friction among the criminals and the romance between Doug and Claire. The uncertainty surrounding his future in Charlestown especially with the FBI closing in convinces Doug that his best option is to leave Boston. That doesnt sit well with Coughlin who views such a defection as a betrayal; Dougs trashy drug and alcohol-addicted ex-lover Krista (Blake Lively) who has delusions about reuniting with him; or a local ""boss"" Fergie (Pete Postelthwaite) who relies on Doug to run his operations. So like Al Pacino in The Godfather Part III the more he tries to get out the more they pull him back in. Eventually both the FBI and Fergie use Dougs attachment to Claire for their own ends. Compared to other recent crime dramas this one stands higher not only because of the quality of the performances but because of the nuances evident in the characters. Gone are the days when all criminals wear black hats and all cops are robed in white. Now its gray all over and there are times when the tactics of the ""good guys"" are less honorable than those of the men theyre chasing. The Town has several high-octane action sequences that are suspenseful and easy to follow (no rapid cutting no moving camera). The film captures the look and feel of Charlestown. It has become a clichA(c) but this is one of those productions in which the setting is established and presented with such care that its almost a character in its own right. Those with an affinity for crime dramas action movies where everything doesnt have to move at the speed of sound and thrillers where character development doesnt represent an unwarranted intrusion will appreciate what The Town has to offer. Its not as involving as Gone Baby Gone but thats more a comment about the differences in the source materials than about anything having to do with the filmmaking. The Town is a solid way to start the autumn movie-going season.

Comments (4) click to enlarge The Town Recommended Video Rated R  124 minutes  2010 Ben Afflecks feature directing debut Gone Baby Gone (2007) achieved a tragic depth unusual for a crime film because the child at its center though rescued from kidnappers was ultimately deposited back into a hopeless cycle of poverty and domestic abuse. This second feature doesnt resonate with nearly as much power but its suspenseful story of two generations of career criminals in the citys northerly Charlestown neighborhood has a similarly haunting quality. Two old friends whove been thieving together for years (Affleck and Jeremy Renner of The Hurt Locker) mastermind a bank robbery during which theyre forced to leave with a hostage (Rebecca Hall). Though they release her unharmed and she hasnt seen their faces Affleck later meets and falls in love with her; Renner would rather shut her up permanently. Jon Hamm is the FBI agent gunning for them and Chris Cooper is Afflecks incarcerated father a mean bastard staring down five consecutive life sentences. By J.R.

PicturesBen Affleck in a scene from The Town (pictured with Jeremy Renner) Related Ben AffleckWatch the Conversation Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Ben Affleck has a good brain for filmmaking -- hes clearly a smart and avid student of the medium -- but the elements that make his second outing as a director The Town such an enjoyable and exciting movie have more to do with whats in his heart. There is his love for his hometown of Boston where the story is set shot here with an insiders appreciation for its past both noble and ignoble. Then there is his love for his first profession acting its rare to see an ensemble movie like this so loaded with talented actors in which virtually all of them get an opportunity to make an impression. Affleck is the boss and the star but he knows how to share. He plays bank robber Doug MacRay a native of Charlestown the Irish-influenced working class neighborhood just to the north of Boston proper which the movie tells us has the dubious distinction of producing more bank robbers per capita than anywhere else in the city. Doug has gone into the family business; his dad (Chris Cooper) is in prison for killing two men during a robbery. His mother vanished when he was six. He is a type the star athlete who was going to get out of the hood and trouble by playing professional sports (hockey in this case) but who ends up blowing his chance and back where he started. After battles with Oxycontin and booze Doug has cleaned up chemically (theres a great sea of ravaged Boston-Irish faces at his AA meeting) but not professionally. (Video 10 Questions for Ben Affleck.)The most notable member of his team is Jim (Jeremy Renner). Jim also goes by Jem a nickname he earned in grade school for being ""a real gem"" -- sarcasm intended. Its fair to say hes a real gem when it comes to bank robberies. Hes as cocky as Renners ace bomb defuser in the The Hurt Locker was but otherwise the exact opposite -- trigger happy violent and careless. Its Jems wicked smaht idea to take a hostage -- bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) -- letting her go afterward with the caution that hell find her rape her and kill her if she helps the FBI. Locally thats Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and Dino (Titus Welliver also known as Losts Man in Black). When it turns out Claire also lives in Charlestown sadistic Jem drools at the prospect of keeping her on edge but Doug intervenes. In the name of seeing what she knows he befriends Claire in a laundromat. Claire is another stereotype -- the vulnerable do-gooder who works in the community garden and volunteers with the neighborhood children -- and in the hands of a more conventional actress she would have been a drip. Hall is luminous with Snow White coloring but shes also one of those very special oddball types for whom freckles a gummy smile and a coltish physical awkwardness are assets. You have to keep checking back on her to see why shes so attractive. Doug does the same. We watch as his eyes scan her for any signs she recognizes him from the bank robbery and get distracted by the pleasure of looking at her.Their courtship is filled with delicious moments for us as an audience-in-the-know. ""Whats the worst that could happen?"" Doug says when he asks her out. Claire quickly confides in her new beau about being held hostage ""Im sure Id recognize their voices if I heard them again"" she says with confidence getting a laugh. Afflecks direction and the screenplay (Affleck Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard all get credits for the adaptation of Chuck Hogans book Prince of Thieves) never over-sentimentalize this attraction. Its vivid and we like it but theres too much obvious reality violence and grittiness going on in other parts of the story for us to start mooning over the idea of the two of them riding off into the sunset together. The Catch-22 of their romance -- for Doug whether to tell or not tell Claire the truth -- feels like an actual dilemma not a gimmick. (See TIMEs fall entertainment guide.) For the most part Affleck the director succeeds in holding a lot of threads together and manages to keep us in our seats for the full 130-min running time -- no small feat. A couple story lines get short shrift however including one involving Fergie the Florist (Pete Postlethewaite) the Irish mob leader who controls Charlestown (think Jack Nicholson in The Departed) and another involving Dougs ex-girlfriend (and Jems sister) the perennially wasted single mom Krista played by Gossip Girls Blake Lively. Lively isnt up to the standards of Amy Ryans single mom in Afflecks debut 2007s Gone Baby Gone but shes not half bad. Renner is convincing even if the part is standard stuff and in his few scenes Postlethewaite is quietly terrifying even just slicing thorns off a rose. But its Hamm that gets the juiciest most nuanced supporting role. Agent Frawley is not a complete jerk but hes willing to play dirty if he has to -- as he does with Krista hoping to force her into informing on her brothers gang. Kristas daughter is named Shine (what could be sadder?) and Adam plays that card like an ace. ""This could be a big moment for Shine"" he says. Hes contemptuous and sexy a lot like his Mad Men character Don Draper but theres a meanness there that feels entirely modern. (Video 10 Questions for Jon Hamm.) In the films third act where the conventions of this kind of thriller take over some improbable twists steal some of The Towns power. (Example would Fergie really order his boys to ""take down the cathedral of Boston"" -- i.e. rob Fenway Park -- with the FBI watching their every move?) But well forgive a lot because between the lively car chases the moments of levity that temper the violence (nuns masks are used to fine effect) and the strong performances including his own restrained mature work Affleck keeps showing us a good time. The Town is a thriller that manages to be pleasingly familiar yet fresh. Its perverse to say this about something so bloody but it goes down like cinematic comfort food.

Affleck succeeds with trip to The Town | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAffleck succeeds with trip to The TownSophomore directing effort is a considerable step up from Gone Baby Gone and his acting impresses too.Ben Affleck left as Doug MacRay and Jeremy Renner as Jem Coughlin in The Town.  (Handout / MCT)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Sept. 16 2010 The Town (out of 4) Starring Ben Affleck Rebecca Hall Jeremy Renner Blake Lively and John Hamm. Directed by Ben Affleck. 130 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Ben Affleck has managed to sidestep the curse that can dog a sophomore directing effort with The Town which is in many ways a superior movie to 2007s Gone Baby Gone. Hes faced more than a few career difficulties (Gigli and Pear Harbor to name two) but The Town shows Gone Baby Gone was no fluke and Affleck has considerable talents working both sides of the camera. This time out the story is better and more believable without the silliness that tripped up Gone Baby Gone. Affleck has gone back to Beantown (hes getting to be Woody Allen-like in his devotion to one city) for this look at the tight-knit Boston neighbourhood of Charlestown where being in the family business includes a rap sheet and a fondness for earning money the easy way. Or is it? The gang of coolly violent robbers led by Afflecks smarter-than-average Doug MacRay and his best pal Jem (a superb tightly wound Jeremy Renner of The Hurt Locker) plan heists with such precision and attention to detail right down to the head-covering Halloween masks they wear you cant help but wonder what theyd be able to accomplish working the other side of the law. Doug must be thinking the same thing somewhere in the back of his mind. An on-the-fly decision by the gang to take a bank manager named Claire hostage during a bungled robbery means they now need to keep an eye on her from afar to make sure she doesnt talk. Doug volunteers but his keeping watch turns into a chance meeting which soon becomes something much more. British actress Rebecca Hall who was so compelling in Vicky Cristina Barcelona is credible as Claire a young woman who hopes to make inroads onto the Charlestown community despite being dismissed as an outsider. Perhaps Doug is the one to help her fit in although his jumpy and aggressive pal Jem seems to have taken an instant dislike to her. Dougs struggles to keep his other life a secret -- and to protect Claire -- are compounded by his ex-girlfriend Jems tough-as-nails younger sister Krista. With her smeared makeup and sly ways Blake Lively does well as the streetwise chick who has a few secrets of her own. Affleck also co-wrote the screenplay taken from Chuck Hogans Prince of Thieves. While the story is simple the telling is satisfying thanks to a combination of action scenes an ace car chase through narrow Charlestown streets and a first-rate cast. Pete Postlethwaite as The Florist the crass Irish gangster who has controlled the Towns family businesses since Dougs dad was still out on the street is as menacing and mesmerizing as a hooded cobra. Only Jon Hamm (Mad Men) doesnt fit in playing the FBI agent who is determined to get enough evidence to bring down the gang members whom hes been dogging for ages. The fault isnt with Hamms performance but with his enormous success playing a 1960s ad kingpin in the cable series. He may have left the Brylcreem and grey suits behind but its hard to see anybody but Don Draper chasing down the Town boys. Dougs choices about leaving his criminal life behind test his relationship with Claire and endanger both of them even as the gang plans a final job that unspools with tension and violence. Affleck does well in crafting The Town using aerial shots of the bridge leading into and out of Charlestown to heighten the sense that this is a place apart a separate country from Boston. Hes also done an admirable job of making an unsavoury character not only likeable but a devil worthy of our sympathy.

(Claire Folger) Joe Neumaier Thursday September 16 2010 400 AM Title The Town ""The Town"" marks spotty-careered actor Ben Afflecks second time directing - and with this deft crime drama he more than proves that he deserves to sit behind the camera. The Boston native can go home again and on the way up I-93 he can find enough calamity and characters to fill Fenway Park.That interstate the Charlestown neighborhood around it and the Cathedral of Boston where the Red Sox play provide a vivid backdrop for the story of Doug MacRay a second-generation thief bred in ""the bank robbery capital of the world"" whom Affleck plays with a mixture of efficiency and jovial homeboy-ness. Dougs right-hand man is his childhood pal Jem (Jeremy Renner) a loose cannon who takes chances and wants to hit as many armored cars and vaults as he can.During one job Jem takes a teller Claire (Rebecca Hall) as a hostage but after Doug balks they release her. When FBI agent Frawley (an intense turn by ""Mad Mens"" Jon Hamm) uses Claire to zero in on the gang Doug has to keep tabs on her - and finds himself falling in love. Yet his past on Bunker Hill St. is inescapable and hes soon forced to pull off a major-league job while holding off the Feds the local bosses and Jem.Afflecks directorial debut 2007s ""Gone Baby Gone"" also highlighted his feel for Southie the working-class neighborhood he sprang from. But here working from his Peter Craig and Aaron Stockards script Affleck mixes city savvy with a thuggish energy most thrillers lack. (The studio Warner Bros. has marketed the film as a sort-of descendant of ""The Departed""). A mid-film car chase through Charlestowns narrow streets is edited for maximum jolt while the heists are shot with a 70s-style eye for detail.That style is echoed in Affleck and Halls low-key performances which help to make their contrived meet-cute scene less jarring. Affleck keeps the film as fluid as the Mystic River and never forgets that Renner is his ace in the hole. The ""Hurt Locker"" star charges up every scene hes in with feral power and is rewarded with one of the most exciting sequences seen in any action movie this decade.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review The Town - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-HeistMovie review The TownBen Afflecks Boston-set heist film boasts strong performances and exciting scenes.September 17 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall the hedgehog and the fox combine forces to excellent effect in ""The Town"" a fast-paced character-driven heist movie that combines robberies with romance and solidifies Afflecks reputation as an actor with a genuine gift for directing. The hedgehog in philosopher Isaiah Berlins celebrated formulation knows one big thing and the big thing Boston native Affleck knows inside out is his hometown. Its the site of this film his ""Gone Baby Gone"" directing debut as well as the Oscar-winning ""Good Will Hunting"" screenplay that launched his career. The fox by contrast knows many little things and Hall is a perfect chameleon of an actress whose extraordinary range of parts from roles in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" and ""Please Give"" to the ""Red Riding"" trilogy illustrates that she is capable of becoming anybody anywhere. ""The Town"" also shows signs that just because Affleck does his best work in Boston it doesnt mean hes limited to it. Hes had a hand (along with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) in the films nicely done screenplay and hes gotten excellent performances out of such formidable costars as "" The Hurt Lockers"" Jeremy Renner ""Mad Mens"" John Hamm Chris Cooper Pete Postlethwaite and Blake Lively. Affleck also seems more confident and at ease in the directors chair this time around and less like the actor with something to prove. The films palpable authenticity is less self-conscious than it was in ""Gone Baby Gone"" and Affleck is able to create a strong enough sense of verisimilitude to allow us to buy into the films unlikely premise. Based on the novel ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan ""The Town"" is set in Charlestown a slowly gentrifying blue-collar Boston neighborhood that has apparently produced more bank robbers than any comparable area in the world. Its a crack team of four of those locally bred criminal professionals we see first wearing skeleton Halloween masks and expertly taking down a bank in nearby Cambridge. Quick slick and forceful the team is savvy enough to check potential cash for dye packs and bait bills and understands that being loud and scary is half the battle. The strategist and planner of this gang of four is Doug MacRay (Affleck) a wary and determined man of almost feral intelligence. The actor looking tattooed and haggard but extremely buff makes MacRay convincingly blue collar but also someone who could be reflective around the edges if the situation demanded it. Which it soon does. Under ordinary circumstances MacRay would never meet Claire Keesey (Hall) the manager of the bank he and his masked team rob. When Claire is too terrified to open the vault however he takes her hand and calms her down like an instructor in a yoga class and then looks on aghast when his closest friend and partner Jem impulsively decides to briefly kidnap her. As played by the redoubtable Renner an actor who is expert at humanizing dangerous possibly psychotic menace Jem is the wild card of MacRays gang the man who is capable of anything. He and MacRay go back to childhood and MacRay briefly dated Jems hard-nosed sister Krista (Lively) so when Jem worries that Claire who turns out to live nearby might be able to recognize them MacRay knows its less risky if he volunteers to find out himself. MacRay engineers a meet cute at a neighborhood laundromat and because Claire is in a fragile post-traumatic state after the robbery she is more receptive than she might otherwise be to the attentions of the handsome local with the deadpan charm. Its a credit to the skill of the filmmaking in general and the acting in particular that this increasingly serious relationship is conveyed in a convincing way. Helping to make this happen is time spent constructing a solid backstory for MacRay involving his parents and his younger days. We get to meet his imprisoned hard-case father (Cooper mightily impressive in his only scene) as well as the sinister Fergie Colm (Postlethwaite) a local crime kingpin. ""The Town"" pays equal attention to the illegal side of its story boasting several exciting robberies and a tense car chase through Bostons narrow North End. And since traditional crime dramas are only as strong as the strength of the lawmen pursuing the evildoers Hamm is ideally cast as implacable FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley relentless in his pursuit of MacRay and his team. Though the FBI always seems one step behind MacRay that is too close for the criminals comfort and as the walls start closing in he has to make some serious decisions. As for Affleck the decision he made to star in and direct ""The Town"" was one of the best hes made in a while. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe Town The job is more than staging a heistSeptember 12 2010Capsule movie reviews 222June 18 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTHeistBlue-collarCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-town-20100917,0,5991399.story",200,thetown20,thetown,latimes

Claire Folger Ben Affleck as Doug McRay and Jeremy Renner as Jem Couglin in ""The Town."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In ""The Departed"" Martin Scorsese presented Boston as a brutal yet colorful playground for crooks and cops and crooked cops. This was the old master at his most garish and fun -- challenging his actors (most notably Jack Nicholson) to revel in ostentatious almost cartoonish performances. ""The Town"" also based in Boston is a pedal-to-the-metal heist thriller but for all its gun battles and car chases it feels like the more grounded of the two movies. Maybe because its director -- Ben Affleck -- seems more interested in the pathos of violent men than the spectacle of their violence. Affleck finds the core of their desolation in the festering neighborhoods they have never left. After making his directorial debut with the grimly atmospheric ""Gone Baby Gone"" in 2007 he again displays a gift for conjuring the authentic mood and aura of a specific place. Clearly Bostons underbelly is his No. 1 muse. Charlestown is one of the citys oldest Irish neighborhoods and if we are to believe the movies premise this square mile of rowhouses and tenements is the spawning ground for many of Bostons most notorious bank robbers their vocation passed down from father to son. Affleck directs himself as Doug MacRay the leader of a blue-collar heist squad. With full Bah-ston accent Affleck plays MacRay as the compassionate criminal. In the films stunning opener the crew takes down a Cambridge bank brandishing assault rifles and wearing Halloween masks. To ensure their escape they take the banks manager a young woman named Claire hostage. They let her go but soon MacRay tracks Claire down taking pity on her for the distress hes caused. Charmed by his kindness she falls for him having no idea who he really is. Like every Hollywood bank robber before him MacRay needs one last score before he can call it quits. Foiling his plan is an FBI agent played by Jon Hamm (""Mad Men""). Hamm sheds his pampered TV image for a scruffy lawman obsessed with stopping MacRay. THE TOWN  1/2 out of 4 stars. Rated R for strong violence pervasive language some sexuality and drug use. While the film is based on Chuck Hogans novel ""Prince of Thieves"" Afflecks vision owes just as much to Michael Manns 1995 heist opus ""Heat."" Like that film ""The Town"" finds its best moments in the quiet intense conversations between men on both sides of the law while the elaborate heist sequences simply act as exclamation points. As an action movie ""The Town"" is good. But as a moody character study it can be mesmerizing. In Afflecks great assembly of actors two stand out. Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") chews through every one of his scenes as MacRays hot-tempered partner in crime. Pete Postlethwaite melts into the role of an Irish crime boss with a peculiar day job. The 65-year-old actor is skin-and-bones here -- his large head bobbling on skinny shoulders -- but as Fergie the Florist he is chilling snipping away at the stems of roses as if they were the limbs of his enemies. Still for all its luster ""The Town"" makes one miscalculation leaving you wanting more at maybe its most crucial moment the end. Youll find no spoilers here so lets just say that the final collection of scenes -- in which MacRays fate is decided -- feels slightly askew from the wonderfully told tale of grit and grime that came before it.

Its not only an efficient heist its an efficient piece of moviemaking. And Ben Affleck who stars as Doug MacRay the brains behind a gang of stickup artists is the brain behind the cameras too.In his second directorial effort - like Gone Baby Gone its set in the tougher precincts of his hometown Boston - Affleck works the familiar turf of a cops-and-robbers thriller but populates it with characters who come convincingly and often creepily to life.In truth this robbery isnt perfect. An alarm gets triggered a hostage taken. Shes Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) the banks manager and shes let go soon enough after the getaway blindfolded left on a sandy strip along the harbor shaken but unharmed.And thats how the romance at the center of The Town - a title that alludes to Charlestown the Boston neighborhood thats home to Doug and his crew and to generations of hardscrabble Irish American types - is born. It turns out that Claire lives in a gentrified corner of the same mile-square area and Doug decides to check on her and make sure she doesnt know anything that could identify him and his cohorts to the law.They meet cute in a laundromat. He of course already knows who she is. But she doesnt have a clue that a few days earlier he was wearing a mask wielding a weapon and ordering her to open her banks safe.The Town has been adapted from Chuck Hogans smart page-turner Prince of Thieves with a great deal of fidelity. (And a great team of filmmakers including There Will Be Blood cinematographer Robert Elswit.)Theres one significant change that Affleck and his cowriters have opted for however that perhaps makes the movie less than it might have been. In Hogans book the FBI agent who goes after Doug - played with gruff cool and three days worth of stubble by Mad Mens Jon Hamm - also goes after Claire. The men are at odds not just because ones a crook and the other a cop. Theyre vying for the same woman as well.Perhaps this is too messy a business to cram into a couple of hours (or too implausible?) but it leaves Hamm with not much to do besides bark commands furrow his brow and smooth-talk Blake Lively - who plays Dougs trampy townie ex.Shes also Jems sister - Jem being Dougs childhood friend and hotheaded partner in crime. The casting couldnt be better Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) scary and menacing as Jem; Hall fragile and a bit unfathomable as Claire and Affleck himself working his jaw around a gritty accent playing a guy struggling mightily to cut his roots and quit the armed-robbery business altogether. And maybe quit it with Claire.In small but memorable turns Chris Cooper as Dougs dad doing time in jail and Pete Postlethwaite as the local crime boss - a wiry unpleasant gent whose front is a tiny Charlestown flower shop.The Town boasts terrifically orchestrated action sequences culminating in an armored-car hijacking at Fenway Park where a weekend Red Sox stand has left the stadiums coffers overflowing. And theres a car chase through a maze of narrow Boston streets. But Affleck is more interested in the people in the midst of the action than he is in the action itself and that gives this accomplished genre piece considerable and compelling depth.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

In this film publicity image released by Warner Bros. from left Slaine Ben Affleck Jeremy Renner and Owen Burke are shown in a scene from ""The Town."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures) The town is Charlestown an Irish-American enclave across a bridge -- but a world away -- from staid Boston. The prologue of Ben Afflecks dense daring thriller ""The Town"" tells us that Charlestown has produced more bank robbers than any other locale in the United States.Yet because their specialized skills and clannish codes of honor have been passed down through the generations the young hooligans in this movie are not unlike Old World artisans. As in many heist flicks theres a superhuman driver (rapper Slaine) a taciturn tech specialist (Owen Burke) a reckless trigger man (Jeremy Renner) and a soulful brain (Affleck). But as he proved in ""Gone Baby Gone"" Affleck who co-wrote the screenplay from a novel called ""Price of Thieves"" can effectively flesh out pulp fiction because he knows the turf and he works with some superb actors. Although Affleck couldnt resist casting himself as sensitive anti-hero Doug Renner an Oscar nominee for ""The Hurt Locker"" steals the show. In the crackerjack opening his skeleton-masked character James pummels one witness and kidnaps another making him seem too stupid to be a veteran thief. Yet this crazed co-pilot has a secret stash of wily intelligence and control of the reins that bind Doug to his incarcerated father (Chris Cooper) and to James beautiful barfly sister (Blake Lively in an eye-opening role). But Doug is a recovering alcoholic who allows himself to imagine a better life with Claire (Rebecca Hall always good) the skittish assistant bank manager who is a briefly abducted and then released by the masked crew. Soon after Doug is satisfied that Claire cant recognize the robbers he starts to woo her ""Lady and the Tramp""-style. Such a tired plot twist is strike one against realism. Strike two is the loopy notion that a violent criminal history isnt incompatible with true love. And its almost strike three when Doug reluctantly agrees to pull ""one last job"" for the neighborhood kingpin (Pete Postlethwaite who is great) under the nose of an FBI investigator (Jon Hamm who finds shades of gray in an ostensible good guy). But the robbery sequences and the escapes through crowded iconic locales are so thrillingly cinematic that even a grumpy umpire can give ""The Town"" a free pass.Because of some sentimental backspin Affleck doesnt quite hit it out of the park but he may provoke the green monster of envy in lesser directors.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As impressively controlled as Gone Baby Gone was Ben Afflecks directorial debut had a slightly airless quality as if the film had been finished then sealed behind a layer of plastic. His second feature The Town is a looser and more sprawling affair more conventional but also more assured. Its also more of an Affleck movie. Though he stayed behind the camera for his first outing this time he reserves the central role for himself that of a professional bank robber who finally gets a whiff of the straight life. The son of convicted larcenist Chris Cooper now serving a life bid in prison Affleck is the brains behind his four-man crew which includes lifelong friend and occasional sparring partner Jeremy Renner. Theyre prolific enough to draw the attention of FBI agents Jon Hamm and Titus Welliver but careful enough not to show their faces or leave any useful evidence behind--at least until wild card Renner decides to nab bank manager Rebecca Hall as collateral for their quick getaway. Physically Hall gets away unharmed but shes emotionally wrecked enough that she falls too quickly for Affleck who comes sniffing around at Renners behest to make sure she doesnt think about going to the cops. As Affleck and Halls relationship deepens and turns romantic the increasingly volatile Renner presses for bigger and less well-prepared jobs culminating in an attack on one of old Bostons crown jewels. Although the movie is set in Bostons blue-collar Charlestown neighborhood Affleck appears to have moved past the attention to regional flavor that gave Gone Baby Gone some of its special kick. There are clam-chowder accents and Fighting Irish tattoos aplenty but the plot based on Chuck Hogans novel Prince Of Thieves is boilerplate and at times merely silly. Affleck doesnt have the directorial chops to bring off a movie painted in such broad strokes or to tap into the genres archetypal roots in a way that would bring life to some of its most worn-out elements. Still Affleck uses his cast which also includes a tarted-up Blake Lively as Renners sister and Afflecks former flame exceedingly well especially given that the actors often arent given much to work with. The movies exterior is solid but its hollow inside like a safe filled with air.

"The Town is long baby long - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Town is long baby longActors feast on Ben Afflecks overstuffed heist filmSeptember 16 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic2 1/2 stars Worth seeing for its actors director Ben Afflecks sophomore directorial feature ""The Town"" wouldve made a fine trim early-1930s studio picture from whats commonly called the pre-Production Code era. Its violent but softhearted and clearly digs the grungy allure of its chosen criminal world where the bank robbers disguise themselves as ghouls or ghoulish nuns in full habit. Furthering the pre-Code vibe the films production notes include a sop to the guardians of decency noting in a dedication that Bostons Charlestown neighborhood may be known for its bank and armored car robbers but the movie ""all but ignores the great majority of the residents of Charlestown past and present who are the same good and true people found most anywhere."" Yes but theres no movie in those people Theres a decent movie in ""The Town"" though this adaptation of the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince of Thieves"" stretches out to a misjudged 130 minutes. Two hours plus change isnt long really. Plenty of films and not just epics justify three or more hours. Here though just when the screws should tighten we get another leisurely dialogue scene and hammy inevitables such as the protagonist played by Affleck telling his less stable partner in crime played by Jeremy Renner of ""The Hurt Locker"" ""Ya been like a brutha to me."" For an hour or so the action stays human-scaled and Afflecks eye for locales proved by ""Gone Baby Gone"" lends an authentic texture to the story. Afflecks character Doug MacRay had a dream of becoming a pro hockey player but ended up following in the footsteps of his bank robber father ( Chris Cooper making hay on very little screen time). This is a one-last-job movie. Doug angles to make one last score with the gang and go clean. Renners character hotheaded Jem doesnt like the idea; he wants things to stay as they are robbery after robbery. In the films opening bank heist the Charlestown thieves end up taking a hostage bank manager Claire ( Rebecca Hall who knows no dishonesty on screen). Shaken afterward but unable to recognize her disguised assailants Claire becomes involved with Doug. Is that believable? Affleck and Hall make it so. Its only when ""The Town"" escalates the carnage for a big finish involving Fenway Park and a lotta lotta money that we actively stop believing. One of three credited writers director Affleck likely felt the need to deliver a sympathetic relatable honorable criminal in Doug just as he felt pressure to deliver enough shoot-em-up material to get people past the thickness of the local dialect. The best work comes in the smaller scenes. Blake Lively is exceptional in the role of a drug-addled single mother who represents the life Dougs trying to ditch. Everyones effective even when hamstrung by cliches. Well almost everyone I love Pete Postlethwaite as a rule but here -- as a murderous florist who pulls all the strings -- he overacts his key scene so badly its as if he did it on a dare. Also Jon Hamm may rule on ""Mad Men"" but here hes stuck as a rather dimwitted FBI agent whos two beats behind the action always. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for strong violence pervasive language some sexuality and drug use) Cast Ben Affleck (Doug); Rebecca Hall (Claire); Jon Hamm (Agent Frawley); Jeremy Renner (Jem); Blake Lively (Krista); Pete Postlethwaite (Fergie); Chris Cooper (Mac) Credits Directed by Ben Affleck; written by Peter Craig Affleck and Aaron Stockard based on the novel ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan; produced by Graham King and Basil Iwanyk.

The Town Good Director Ben Affleck. Cast Ben Affleck Rebecca Hall Jeremy Renner. Rating R for strong violence pervasive language sexuality and drug use. Qamp;A Ben Affleck is officially a serious director Jeremy Renner makes up for lost time with hot roles Spotlight Ben Affleck | Heist flicks Usually when we ask this kind of question its in the context of ""How did a once-promising talent manage to let things slip away?"" In fact that question was once asked of Affleck. He won an Oscar with his pal Matt Damon for writing ""Good Will Hunting"" and watched as his friends star rose even as Afflecks waned thanks to poor choices (the occasional tabloid romance didnt help). Yes ""Gone Baby Gone"" his debut as a feature director (he also co-wrote the script) was promising but was it just a lucky break? Now with ""The Town"" which Affleck co-wrote directs and stars in we have our answer to the latter question No. And we ask anew What happened to Ben Affleck? Only this time its to try to figure out how he got so good again. ""The Town"" is set in Afflecks beloved Boston on the streets of Charlestown a neighborhood that produces more bank robbers per capita than anywhere else in the world. And from the looks of things the fewest cooperative witnesses. These people are tight-lipped about everything; the thought of ratting out a friend is unthinkable no matter what hes done. This certainly makes things easier for Doug MacRay (Affleck) the brains of a crew that pulls off elaborate well-thought-out bank jobs while dressed in Skeletor masks or nuns habits. During one job they briefly take Claire (Rebecca Hall) a bank manager hostage. Shes let go without incident but soon the gang realizes that she too lives in Charlestown. What does she know? And what can be done about it? Dougs lifelong friend a trigger-happy ex-con psycho named Jem (Jeremy Renner) wants to solve the matter quickly kill her and be done with it. Dougs cooler head prevails however and he begins checking her out. And then begins dating her. Claire who was blindfolded during her abduction has no idea shes going out with one of her captors. Meanwhile FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) gathers evidence but is frustrated by the neighborhoods code of silence (as well as Dougs skill at robbing banks). He knows whos robbing the banks he just needs to get enough proof to arrest Doug and his cohorts. Its a cat-and-mouse game one thats familiar from any number of films which means that if it is to succeed the movie is dependent upon performance on execution. In other words its dependent upon Affleck and he comes through on both fronts. Renner and Hamm play stock characters but their performances elevate the roles to something more. (Renner as he proved in ""The Hurt Locker"" is an especially convincing psycho.) Hall is a fantastic actress good in everything she does. She portrays perfectly the confusion and vulnerability of someone violated as well as the hope one might find in a budding relationship. Of course we know more than she does which makes it all the more heartbreaking. But Affleck is the center of the film. His Doug is in some respects rather like Affleck - the director of the elaborate heists as well as a performer in them. He longs for a better life almost alone among his peers as someone who senses there is something better out there somewhere. The ties that bind him to his neighborhood however are tighter than even he realizes. Its a measured strong performance certainly one of Afflecks best. Perhaps he can credit his director.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + I dont care what anyone outside the greater metropolitan area says ""The Town takes place in Movie Boston rather than the real thing. Movie Boston is a sub-Scorsese landscape of stubbled men walking down mean Suffolk County streets that exist primarily in the minds of good pulp novelists and bad screenwriters and its authenticity depends far too much on Hollywood actors trying hahd to bend their dialogue around non-rhotic speech patterns.That said Ben Afflecks latest is a pretty decent crime drama -- not a patch on the best parts of his directorial debut 2007s ""Gone Baby Gone but its moody and grim and engrossing if you approach it with the right expectations. The local horselaughs that have greeted the trailer for ""The Town -- with its stentorian voice-over implying that the ""one-square-mile neighborhood called Charlestown is responsible for every urban plague from bank heists to bedbugs -- wont extend to the movie which traffics in cliches but keeps the traffic moving.Instead of directing his brother Casey (whos off chasing the ghost of Joaquin Phoenix) Affleck directs himself this time. He plays Doug MacRay the leader of a four-man Charlestown bank-robbery crew that prides itself on planning efficiency and the threat of maximum violence. We see them in action early on and we also see the teams weak link Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker) as hair-trigger Jimmy Coughlin Dougs oldest friend and biggest liability.If Afflecks doing a riff on the sexy doom-laden antiheroes of 40s film noir Renners doing straight-up Cagney and hes the most watchable thing in the movie. His character is itchy with aggression complete in his loathing of yuppies and other ""tunies crowding into the old nabe. If Jimmy knew that Doug was falling for the lissome bank manager they briefly took hostage on their last job hed pitch a fit.Yes its that kind of movie where you have to swallow some sizable coincidences and implausibilities if you want to play along. Claire (Rebecca Hall) may not have laid eyes on Doug during the robbery (he was wearing a Halloween mask) but she certainly heard his voice and Affleck gives that voice a velvety growl a woman would remember even if she didnt turn out to live just on the other side of the Monument.The romance is the silliest part of ""The Town but its also the part that works best maybe because its so frankly a movie device and this director so frankly loves movies. As an actor Affleck is a nice visual match for Hall -- theyre both big rangy people who seem comfortable in their own skin -- and we root for Doug and Claire to make it even as we know that the big revelation (Ive been dating the guy who held me at gunpoint and ditched me in East Boston) might possibly be a deal killer. That knowledge weighs Doug down and gives him substance Hes betting it all on something that cant last. Otherwise ""The Town feels a little too familiar and a little too canned from the regulation three-day beard on everyone up to and including Jon Hamms implacable FBI agent (really? Feds dont shave?) to Blake Lively (""Gossip Girl) slumming it as Jimmys slatternly sister Krista a single mom who pines for Doug but is willing to go home with whoevers paying at closing time. This is more or less the same role that got Amy Ryan an Oscar nomination in ""Gone Baby Gone but Lively is to put it kindly not Amy Ryan.Is ""The Town authentic? Hell if I know -- Im from Brookline. For that matter the directors from Cambridge and the curse of this citys clannishness (one of them anyway) is that you can never speak to the reality of the next town over without somebody getting their panties in a twist. Thats partly the point of both Chuck Hogans original novel (""Prince of Thieves) and this adaptation A community that takes so much pride in insularity will eventually choke on it. But Afflecks more interested in townie mythologizing and borrowed Lehane-ian street cred; did I mention hes from Cambridge?On the local-color level at least he gets things reasonably right. You buy that a vicious neighborhood top dog might look like Pete Postlethwaite and work as a florist; that his muscle might look like Dennis McLaughlin a non-actor with excellent B-movie presence. As the other members of the crew Slaine and Owen Burke have the proper pasty anonymity and the faces in the corners of the screen are pink and hard. The knowingly chosen locations lead up to an amusing performance by Fenway Park as itself and the grand absurdity of a high-speed police chase through the narrow streets of the North End has been thought out with devilish care. For once the geography in a Boston movie makes sense; even the standard shot of the Zakim Bridge has relevance.The accents? Oddly Afflecks feels the most forced -- maybe Hollywood diction lessons beat the regionalism out of him. Hall conquers her British cadences and sounds appropriately mid-Atlantic and Renner bless him wins the Jill Quigg award for most lived-in local speech patterns. He doesnt push it and he doesnt underdo it; this is just how Jimmy talks which is an extension of the shark-like rapacity with which he moves through the world. Accent is destiny in the Movie Boston rule book and the pleasure and the limitation of ""The Town is that it plays squarely by the rules.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

MacRays crew is among the best--or the most theatrical judging by their costume selection coming out like some Ozzfest second-stage act in purple-dreadlocked skull masks or nuns habits.The Town is based on Chuck Hogans 2004 novel Prince of Thieves (set unlike the movie in 96 when Charlestown-affiliated heists were actually at their height). In its first chapter Hogans book has MacRay ""tearing off his jumpsuit as if he were trying to shed his own criminal skin."" Already reconsidering the life hes living--hes AA-pledged sipping soda while his boys get wrecked as always--MacRay finds an added motive to change in his tentative relationship with Claire (Rebecca Hall) one of the Prius-driving yuppies whove started to rent up newly chic Charlestown. Unbeknownst to Claire Dougs the same guy who recently stormed her bank and held her hostage; their affair begins as he follow-up-stalks her and they meet-cute at a neighborhood laundromat. Being a character study of a gifted low-bred neer-do-well with dark secrets redeemed by a clean middle-class cutie its easy to see the appeal of Hogans novel for Will Huntings co-creator--who has since acquired a taste for big-fireball action very freely indulged here.Conspiring against Dougs regeneration are his on-the-block loyalties. Theres Jem (Jeremy Renner) his best friend from second grade and lieutenant increasingly a loose cannon on jobs and Jems sister Krista (Blake Lively slumming in hoop earrings) an Oxycontin-slinging slattern whom Doug still takes upstairs sometimes. And demanding more than an apology for Dougs crimes is one Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) the head of an FBI bank-job task force presiding over spiffy procedural scenes trying to find a crack in the Irish omerta.Part of this is attempted through cocky-flirty interrogations of Dougs women some of The Towns variously successful actor duets. The interclass Doug-Claire-Krista triangle is the stuff of High Sierra Some Came Running . . . except that Lively substitutes runny eyeliner for yearning while Affleck and Hall do not as they say set the screen on fire having little time for play outside of the personal confessions theyre forever unloading on each other (""My brother died on a day like this . . .""). Broad stolid Affleck does more with macho pathos goaded by Renners shanty-Irish tough Jem in-your-face with his squelched mug; hes fantastic ambushing Doug on a date the smirking ghost his of Townie past. Also indelible is Pete Postlethwaite--ratlike bandy-armed complexion like the penny left in Coca-Cola overnight--in the small part of neighborhood boss Fergie Colm who runs his operation from a florists shop owning the screen for the time it takes him to brutally trim a rose.The Town is a scrupulously location-scouted aggressively BOSTON movie. Space between scenes is filled with what amounts to a complete helicopter tour down the Charles River--interruptions adding to the movies queerly compartmentalized feel. Its difficult to connect the films characters to the action figures of a major set piece inside Fenway or the car chase ricocheting through the narrow red-brick streets of the North End. Picturesque qualities aside Bostons recent popularity as a location has I suspect much to do with its status as refuge for a viable street-tough urban poor--whore white and more box-office bankable (""They think theres no more serious white people"" says Lively white as snow if not viably serious). Tallying up the films shot in say black Roxbury wont take much time.Clocking in at a heavy two hours The Town does not end before Affleck wears a snicker-inspiring introspective beard. If for this alone it misses on the big emotional gut-punch--but its good enough at least that you wish it was better.

By Anthony Lane Rebecca Hall Ben Affleck and Jon Hamm in a film that Affleck directed.   Credit Illustration by Mark Ulriksen Does every actor want to direct? That is one of the sustaining legends of Hollywood triggered in part by the commanding example of Chaplin who thought nothing of starring directing and producing while writing his own scores. The need to migrate behind the camera has never died and no leading male has been immune--Bambi perhaps although rumors persist of stag footage locked away in the Disney vaults. The latest convert is Ben Affleck whose acting career had reached the point at which in ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) viewers were longing for the Japanese to hurry up and attack. Skip forward six years and Affleck surprised everybody though maybe not himself by directing ""Gone Baby Gone"" set in his home town of Boston a work whose earthy tensions suggested if not a Pauline conversion then at least a clear realization that man cannot live by ""Gigli"" alone. Affleck has stuck close to home for ""The Town"" an adaptation of Chuck Hogans novel ""Prince of Thieves."" The town in question is Charlestown which according to the opening credits has produced more bank robbers than anywhere else on earth. Makes you proud. Affleck multitasking to a fault plays the hero Doug MacRay although to be fair he takes care to encircle the guy with characters of equal heft and some dangerously skilled actors to fill their shoes. Getting Chris Cooper to play your old man for instance is a risky move and Cooper granted a single scene walks off with it in his pocket. A fitting trick I guess for these men are thieves and ""The Town"" which shows the same damp stain of sentimentality that spreads across even (or especially) the toughest of American crime pictures functions on the principle that thieves are defined less by the beatings that they mete out than by the honor among them--or as Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) the F.B.I. agent on Dougs case prefers to call it ""your pitiable misguided Irish omerta."" I had to drum my fingers on the armrest for more than an hour before one thug said to another ""You been like a brother to me"" but it was worth the wait. We get three robberies in all two placed as bookends and one nicely shelved in the middle. In the first Doug his friend Jem (Jeremy Renner) and a couple of others invade a bank as it opens in the morning grabbing the manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) and briefly holding her hostage. In the third the guys prey on the weekend takings at Fenway Park. The pick of the bunch I would say is the second job because a car chase is tacked on as a bonus and because the villains wear rubbery nun masks complete with wimples. Talk about solving a problem like Maria. The chase winds and whips along tranquil moneyed streets and the most provoking aspect of ""The Town"" is the way that it mashes together the low and the high with Doug growing twitchy whenever transgression tugs him out of his neighborhood. If anything this was more pronounced in Hogans novel which was published in 2004 but set eight years earlier allowing the author to map the inroads of gentrification and the social cracks that they bequeathed. The Doug of the movie works for Boston Sand amp; Gravel but the Doug of the book is a ""sky-maker"" in the demolition trade who can josh with his pals in the basement of a bar ""a dungeon of piss and beer"" while upstairs--""like climbing out of a subway station into a cocktail party""--Frawley sips margaritas with a real-estate agent. What survives of that culture crunch in Afflecks film is a romance between Doug and Claire; she doesnt recognize him from the bank raid because he wore a skull mask and wig so he follows her finds her in a laundromat and falls in love. Cue some delicious exchanges as she recalls that traumatizing day. ""Im sorry"" he says in sympathy. ""Its not your fault"" she replies. Hah. This is fun to watch but is it any more plausible than it was in the novel? I couldnt help asking whether someone like Claire would honestly get her kicks let alone her hearts desire by slumming it with the gravel guy--particularly a Claire played by Rebecca Hall who looks as smart and ripe as ever and is almost comically responsive to emotional tremors but whose deportment and cheekbones put her squarely in Edith Wharton land no matter how rough the company she keeps. The most grounded presence here is that of Jeremy Renner who from minute to minute seems about as safe to approach as one of the bombs that he dismantled in ""The Hurt Locker"" and who is rapidly turning into one of our best and scariest squareheads--a noble tradition taking in everyone from James Cagney to Van Heflin. Invited to ""hurt some people"" Jem doesnt quibble or quail; he simply waits a beat then asks ""Whose car we gonna take?"" At its best ""The Town"" is hard and Jem-like. People such as Jem and Doug burn most brightly in their actions whereas the scenes of downtime feel more diffuse and more rushed strangely than the fistfights and shoot-outs that they are designed to interrupt. Is that why Jon Hamm seems mildly stranded as the G-man? He looks happy to bear arms but as ""Mad Men"" has majestically proved his forte is the light frown and the raised glass hinting at a world of perplexity beneath and the role of Frawley yields him precious little time to muse. If you take your Boston neat I would refer you first to Hogans book or of course to anything by George V. Higgins who could pack whole parishes of belief and attitude into one ream of speech. On the other hand Affleck the movie director makes you truly badly want his bunch of neer-do-wells to pull off their heists without a scratch and you cant ask for much more than that. They even show you how to destroy CCTV evidence put the tapes in a microwave. I cant think of a better way to deal with unwanted films. Not to be outdone Philip Seymour Hoffman has also turned to directing. His debut ""Jack Goes Boating""--no relation sadly to ""Celine and Julie Go Boating"" Jacques Rivettes exhilaratingly tall tale of 1974--is based on a play by Bob Glaudini which Hoffman starred in Off Broadway. Onscreen he takes the title role again and brings with him two members of the original cast Daphne Rubin-Vega who plays Lucy and John Ortiz who plays Clyde Lucys long-suffering husband although she would claim that there was suffering on both sides. Clyde is Jacks best friend. The two of them drive limos for a living and the infrequent glimpses of their routine meeting the needs of the wealthy without demur (""Plaza client wants to take his kid to Serendipity for the hot-chocolate sundae"" Clyde reports) leave you wanting more; the rearview mirror as Scorsese showed in ""Taxi Driver"" is as good a magnifying glass as any through which to scan the city and its sins. The bulk of the film belongs to Jack and its quite a bulk. The sight of him pale and porky inching himself into the waters of a public pool where Clyde is teaching him how to swim could be cut and pasted straight into a documentary on the breeding grounds of the dugong. Jack wants to swim because though the action unfolds with much snuffling in midwinter he already plans to take Connie (Amy Ryan) a workmate of Lucys out boating when summer comes. Likewise after inviting Connie to dinner he takes cooking lessons with a chef from the Waldorf. As a full-time fretter Jack likes to cover all eventualities. ""He practiced the chops six times"" Lucy says of the main course. The movies highlight if that is the right word consists of the dinner itself a foursome for the two couples which like a mirthless farce goes as wrong as every viewer will have foreseen. A bellowing Jack shuts himself in the bathroom and shakes with despair responding to burned chops with slightly less aplomb than say Raskolnikov did when he slew an old lady with an axe. Hoffman stares out at us in the opening frame of the film and is seldom absent thereafter yet ""Jack Goes Boating"" comes across as an exercise not in auto-flattery but in penitential gloom. Few actors can boast so bracing a range but you would hardly know from the new movie that the same performer could have bounced and blitzed his way through ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Charlie Wilsons War"" let alone crowed as Truman Capote. This Hoffman with his anxious cough and ropey mane still looks hung over from the depressive ordeal of ""Synecdoche New York"" and Jack is often deliberately armored against the world in a knit hat scarf and headphones. No film director novice or veteran could have done much to scrub off the stagy blend of plaint and ruefulness that coats Glaudinis lines (""Youll always be nothing nothing"") and we get a scattering of those breathless hushes that in the theatre always make me wish Id ordered a Scotch for the intermission. Yet there is for all that something impressive in the very doggedness of the project and in Hoffmans dedication to low-achieving souls. If you fancy a modern ""Marty"" with the old warmth muffled by unfriendly snow go right ahead.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Pictures) Ben Affleck can look slack-faced and vague like a moose in the klieg lights but hes remarkably present (for him) in the socko crime thriller The Town. Hes the director as well as the star and his watchful intelligence comes throughthat and his tenderness toward the actors in his care. It helps that Afflecks character a career armed robber named Doug MacRay has reasons of his own to be watchful. After MacRay and his gang (wearing skull masks) pull off a brutal bank job a single-minded FBI agent (Jon Hamm) begins to close inat which point MacRays edgy partner Jem (Jeremy Renner) wants to track down and terrorize the bank manager (Rebecca Hall) whom theyd briefly taken hostage. MacRay knows that Jem is apt to get carried away and eliminate this one loose end so he insists on threatening the woman himself which he doesnt get around to doing on account of his falling in love with her. Will she find out he was the one with the gun to her head? Awkward. The plot is Hollywood hokum but the movie is called The Town rather than Prince of Thieves the title of the Chuck Hogan novel on which its based and Affleck makes the place the true protagonist; he treats its tribal customs with an anthropologists awe. The setting is predominantly Charlestown a mile-long Boston neighborhood with a tradition of blue-collar crime passed down like a trade were told in the opening titles from father to son. Affleck and his cinematographer Robert Elswit bring out the strangeness of its layout between the Charles and yes Mystic Rivers as exposed and yet remote as Alcatraz the Bunker Hill Monument rising impassively over its impenetrable neighborhoods. In an age in which so many films and TV shows are shot for reasons of economy in Toronto and Vancouver (standing in for Everycity) the movies rootedness is bracing. Affleck is no lug when it comes to action either. The camera bursts into the bank behind the robbers swerving and whipping around as they smash past the teller desks and scream for the employees to hit the floor. Then we see the view through the security camera black and white stationary dead silent. Its a gimmicky transitionbut a neat one The skull masks are genius They bring out the robbers otherness their ghoulish lineage. But as Halls Claire fumbles with the safe too terrified to get the combination right something human slips out from behind MacRays bogeyman visage. Take your time he says. Breathe. You half-expect him to give her a shoulder massage. The nearly six-foot Hall uses her size to express instability; shes so endearingly vulnerable that you know why MacRay wants to protect her. Later when she meets him in a laundromat and tells him about her ordeal he has to work to keep her interests from outweighing his own. The lovable armed robber is of course a sentimental conceit but Renner keeps the film from going soft. I cant think of an actor who does less indicatingi.e. showing instead of living it. In The Hurt Locker he didnt act the hot-dog bomb expert. He just strode toward a bomb as if he needed to defuse it to complete himself. In The Town he doesnt signal that Jem is a sociopath. Hes just a man who has to hurt people to maintain his sense of control. We can feel his drive toward destruction; we know he wont cant forget about Claire and the threat to his sense of order. Its a deeply unnerving performance beyond good or evil. Everyone in The Town shines even Blake Lively but its Chris Cooper as MacRays imprisoned dad who astounds. The performance is hard almost completely internal with the barest hint of disgust at his sons credulity. This is Jon Hamms first meaty movie role since embodyingincomparablyone of the most conflicted characters in the history of television. On one hand its disappointing that his FBI agent Frawley does little besides bark orders stare down suspects and lead his team in gun battles. On the other hand his handsomeness comes through vividly on the big screen. And its good to see him off the booze The Town has its ding-a-ling touches like Claire volunteering in a rec center for poor kids (how sweet) and a buried secret involving MacRays absent mom and a final battle so overscaled its like War of the Worlds in Fenway Park. The denouement is a mistake. But its great to see actors go to (the) town. How do I write about the marvelous Catfish without giving away too much of its bizarre trajectory? Very carefully. Its a new-style narrative documentary that dramatizes the paradox of the Internet which has made us all so much closer to one another yet created so many more ways for us to misrepresent ourselves. (It sets the table for the upcoming David FincherAaron Sorkin Facebook drama The Social Network.) For Catfish directors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost began shooting Schulmans brother a photographer named Nev after an 8-year-old Michigan girl Abby contacted him via Facebook to ask if she could do a painting of a striking dance photo hed just published. When it arrives the painting is better than good; it captures the energy in the female dancers limbs the sense of transcendence in her flight. The little girl an Abigail Breslin type in photos is a prodigy. Nev phones Abbys mother Angela and then as his list of Facebook friends from Abbys circle grows enters into an e-mail and phone relationship with her teenage half-sister Megan a ripely pretty blonde who says she longs for him day and night. Ariel Schulman and Joost follow the burgeoning romance avidlywhich is come to think of it another upshot of modern technology. In an age when hi-def cameras are so affordable and you dont have to pay for film you can keep a nonstop video diary of just about anything. You never know where it will lead. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr LETS GO INVESTIGATE Jon Hamm chases bank robbers in The Town (Claire Folger) A- The Town Genre Mystery and Thriller; Starring Ben Affleck Rebecca Hall Jon Hamm Blake Lively; Director Ben Affleck; Author Peter Craig; Release Date Wide 09/17/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 125; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted September 21 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Ben Affleck opens his satisfying flavorful Boston-accented caps-and-rahbbahs crime drama The Town (opening Sept. 17) with an aerial view of the Bunker Hill Monument a stark obelisk poking at the sky in Charlestown Mass. The monument commemorates one of the first major battles of the American Revolution. But the establishing shot also serves two other purposes It identifies a neighborhood described on screen as infamous for producing more bank and armored-car robbers in one square mile than anywhere else in the U.S. And it anchors viewer awareness that the Boston-steeped actor-director-screenwriter has after some struggle figured out a reliably rewarding trajectory for his career. First with his 2007 success with Gone Baby Gone and now with The Town Affleck the director it turns out has a real feel for making movies about atmospheric grit and the collision of urban law order and disorder. If the films are set in his childhood hometown so much the better because the homeboy does love paying visual attention to the citys tough thin-lipped Irish faces. Affleck the actor meanwhile does his best work playing flawed characters surrounded by strong colleagues. Done and done. In The Town Affleck (who also co-wrote the screenplay based on Chuck Hogans 2004 novel Prince of Thieves) prowls his turf with authority. The actor plays Doug the ambivalent leader of a practiced heist ring all of whom show theatrical flair The teams choice of on-the-job masks tends toward Grinning Ape or Cackling Nun. Their otherwise successful Ape Caper is marred though by the discovery that Claire (Rebecca Hall) the bank manager they briefly held hostage lives nearby in Charlestown. Did she see too much? Dougs volatile ex-con pal Jem (Jeremy Renner) would just as soon eliminate the potential problem with a bang. But Doug opts for caution and says hell check her out. Oh lovers of romantic crime thrillers he does. The two fall in love. (Youve seen that already in the trailer.) The Town is like that -- a rich dark pulpy mess of entanglements that fulfills all the requirements of the genre and is told with an ease and gusto that make the pulp tasty. Mad Mens Jon Hamm is solid as a he-means-business FBI guy; Gossip Girls Blake Lively is pleasingly grungy as Dougs drug-dealing ex-girlfriend who is also Jems sister. Everyone knows everyone on the street and everyone knows how to keep his trap shut. Affleck nails the rhythms of coexistence between neighborhood crooks and regular joes. His instincts are also right in casting Renner in the role of Jem the local baddie with a short fuse and letting the effortlessly magnetic actor steer the pace of the action hinting at danger even when Jems just nursing a brew. With the thrum of unromanticized eff-em he brings to the part Renner supplies the jolt that keeps Affleck on his toes both as an actor and as a director. The Town is the good work of a guy on a path of discovery with Boston as the artists own Freedom Trail.

You Can Quit Your Day Job. By Caryn James On 9/9/10 at 415 PM Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images CultureRemember when Ben Affleck was an easy punchline tagged with the mashup name Bennifer during his tacky tabloid-friendly engagement to Jennifer Lopez and considered the less-smart half of Matt and Ben? Mindy Kaling (from The Office) even co-wrote a hilarious 2003 off-off-Broadway play called Matt and Ben in which the Oscar-winning script for Good Will Hunting wasnt written by Affleck and his pal Matt Damon; it literally fell from the sky. Well the jokes on us. Afflecks heist movie The Town is part of a career turnaround so amazing that he looks like the new Clint Eastwood. Seriously. Affleck directed stars in and co-wrote The Town a suspenseful fiercely paced movie about bank robbers that is also about love brotherhood and the desperate need to escape a crooked life. It proves that Gone Baby Gone his accomplished directing debut was no fluke. And theres no need to torture the Eastwood comparison to see hes on a similar path. Were not talking about some flawless auteurist-god Eastwood (one word Changeling) but the director who steadily turns out audience-pleasing movies with something weighty underneath (Unforgiven) who lives at the crossroads of entertainment and art. Who else has that career? Jack Nicholson Denzel Washington and Tim Robbins are among the A-list actors who have competently stepped behind the camera but in their generation only Affleck and George Clooney have shown genuine directors visions.The Town may feel breezy and escapist but it displays Afflecks signature style deep unobtrusive realism. Like Gone Baby Gone it is set in a working-class neighborhood near Boston where robbing banks runs in families. Affleck grew up in affluent Cambridge but he has a feel for these cramped lives and is thoroughly convincing as Doug MacRay the conflicted mastermind of a gang that includes his close-as-a-brother pal Jem (Jeremy Renner). During the swift creepy opening scenes Dougs gang wears skeleton masks and briefly abducts a bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall). Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Doug falls for Claire who doesnt suspect shes dating one of her kidnappers. No weighty dialogue explains it but we know he is drawn to her innocence and class and that she was a wounded figure before her trauma. Their quietly revealing moments are unpretentious--a very Eastwood touch--and explode into action full of shootouts and car chases through narrow streets. The Town isnt as wrenching as Gone Baby Gone; there is no missing child to drive the plot. But it does have a sleek script in which the FBI (led by Jon Hamm) circles the criminals.Theres shrewd deliberation beneath that apparent ease. In the DVD commentary for Gone Baby Gone Affleck explains that in a night scene he avoided the usual ploy of wetting down the street so it glistens. ""It hasnt always just rained"" he said. That common-sense approach informs much of The Town from the robbers nuking the banks surveillance tapes in a microwave to their inspired disguises for an armored-car job theyre gun-toting nuns in wimples and old-lady Halloween masks.Whatever caused Afflecks turnabout--sobriety marriage fatherhood--its working. Hes also effectively understated as a laid-off executive in John Wellss upcoming indie The Company Men and is about to star in Terrence Malicks next film. So does he feel lucky punk? Hes got luck and something more that screenplay didnt fall from the sky.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

TWITTER You can take the boy out of Boston but Ben Affleck isnt done with his hometown. For his second stint in the directors chair hes back in the citys working-class streets again adapting a crime novel. As with the impressive but flawed ""Gone Baby Gone"" a blue-collar authenticity invigorates ""The Town"" the story of a young criminal who is ready to change his life -- after that one last job. Affleck gets the tribalism of Bostons traditionally Irish-American enclaves; its a defining force in his characters lives. But for all their well-played grit those characters resolutely remain types and for all the well-choreographed action the outcome doesnt matter nearly as much as it should. When the Warner Bros. release bows Sept. 17 following its out-of-competition premiere at the Venice Film Festival its cast and the promise of a grown-up thriller will nonetheless draw many of the same filmgoers who put ""The American"" atop the box office. Based on Chuck Hogans ""Prince of Thieves"" the drama revolves around the neighborhood of Charlestown where onscreen titles explain robbery is a lifelong trade passed down through the generations. Doug MacRay (Affleck) has been knocking over banks and armored trucks for as long as he can remember. His partner in crime is hothead James ""Jem"" Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) a childhood friend who increasingly uses their bond as emotional blackmail and whose hair-trigger violence escalates the danger of their work. In the first adrenaline-rush action set piece Jem brutally beats a bank employee during a heist and impulsively takes a hostage branch manager Claire (Rebecca Hall). But kidnapping is not the boys game and they quickly release her only to discover that shes a local girl albeit one living in the neighborhoods gentrified quarters. Even if she could identify the masked robbers Claires not eager to cooperate with FBI Special Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) who is determined to crack the case. Jem is antsy to make sure she wont talk but Doug insists hell take care of it. What he does is fall for her and she for him. However far-fetched the connection Affleck and the versatile Hall make it work at least for a while. As director he orchestrates a few terrifically tense sequences built upon his characters secret first when Doug sizes up Claire in a Laundromat then when he advises her on how to deal with the FBI -- ""Youre the one whos vulnerable"" -- and especially during a scene at an outdoor cafe where Jem interrupts a date and susses out the situation with more than a suggestion of menace. As our rooting interest Affleck is sympathetic if not compelling. Caught between old-school loyalty and the promise of something beyond Charlestown Doug belongs to the lineage of honorable crooks a movie staple. He represents the possibility of reform. His visit to an AA meeting is dealt with in a refreshingly succinct manner and provides more evidence of the filmmakers eye for local faces. The script credited to Peter Craig Affleck and Aaron Stockard taps into the right veins of provincialism and sarcasm but moves less surely between reckless action and intimate drama. Dougs moral distance from the accelerating brutality of his gangs jobs and especially from Jems volatility -- so evident in Renners every move -- is meant to up the stakes and a third-act heist at Fenway Park just looks crazy. Meting out pieces of Dougs backstory -- complete with a brief and bracing turn by Chris Cooper as his father -- isnt enough. You feel the storytelling wheels turning not the intended visceral punch. It takes Hamm a while to dig into his stock-character lawman and shake off the specter of Don Draper. He has to fight his way through some unconvincing tough-cop dialogue but as the story proceeds and his 5 oclock shadow deepens he makes a bit of wiseass talk sing as does Affleck during an interrogation scene. In the smaller role of a Boston detective Titus Welliver is persuasive and Blake Lively fully embraces the messiness of Dougs dissolute sometime girlfriend. As the Charlestown equivalent of a Mafia don Pete Postlethwaite capitalizes on the chance to pare the leaves from long-stemmed roses while delivering deadly ultimatums. Whether zeroing in on a tete-a-tete or following a high-velocity chase through narrow streets built for another century Robert Elswits fluent widescreen camerawork and Dylan Tichenors editing are strong components as are all the design contributions. The treacly score by Harry Gregson-Williams and David Buckley on the other hand tends to distract rather than enhance. Affleck excels at capturing the insularity of the locale. BlackBerries and OxyContin show up but otherwise this might be the 70s. He includes a nod to that decades Boston-set ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" a melancholy crime drama that would have laughed this movies sentimental ending right into the Charles River.

The behind-the-camera talent Ben Affleck displayed so bracingly in ""Gone Baby Gone"" is confirmed if not significantly advanced in ""The Town."" Again proving a fine director of actors (this time with himself in a starring role) Affleck delivers another potent serious-minded slice of pulp set on Bostons meanest streets where loyalty among thieves runs thicker than blood. But while it pulses with atmosphere this tale of grand larceny unlikely romance and betrayal sacrifices some of ""Babys"" troubling ambiguity and emotional force in pursuit of broader more action-driven appeal. Results should bag Warners an appreciably large payday in wide release. From Martin Scorseses ""The Departed"" to the Dennis Lehane adaptations ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"" the past decade has been a strong one for pictures set in and around certain violent enclaves of Boston. Without skimping on the flavorsome accents pungent atmosphere and fatalistic undertow that come with the territory ""The Town"" with its suggestion of the possibility of escape from a life of tribally ordered violence represents a slightly more optimistic example of this crime-movie subgenre. Based on Chuck Hogans novel ""Prince of Thieves"" the film informs us at the outset that Charlestown Mass. though only one square mile in size has produced more bank robbers and armored-car thieves than any other part of the U.S. One of these is cool-headed Doug MacRay (Affleck) who -- along with his screw-loose best friend James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) and two other partners -- pulls off the efficient unnerving bank job that opens the picture. The sequence is distinguished by its fastidious attention to detail from the bandits use of bleach to remove DNA traces to the ghoulish masks they wear and ends with an agitated James taking bank employee Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage only to release her unharmed after a few hours of driving. An FBI team led by Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) quickly fingers the four crooks -- all repeat offenders who have skillfully evaded capture -- but struggles to find evidence that will make a conviction stick. Meanwhile in the storys most intriguing development James ongoing paranoia about how much Claire saw leads Doug to seek out the traumatized young woman; after some awkwardness in a laundromat meet-cute Claire warms to this handsome stranger unaware hes the same guy who coaxed her into cracking open a vault. Its not hard to see why Claire would be charmed by Doug; were charmed by him too. That speaks well of Afflecks natural likability but leaches some complexity and danger from his conception of this supposedly hardened but terribly romantic criminal. By contrast Renners James seethes with barely repressed violence; his reaction to seeing Doug and Claire together for the first time has an edgy unpredictable tension the picture as a whole could use more of. And so the love of a good woman becomes the catalyst for Dougs decision to ditch his life of crime but Charlestown doesnt surrender its own easily and neither James nor their rigid crime boss Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite) intends to let Doug make a clean getaway. Dougs efforts to extricate himself from his bloody destiny -- inherited from his father and tied to a childhood trauma that doesnt feel dramatically well integrated -- power the films eventful second half during which the team attempts two more armed robberies leading to explosive standoffs with the police and the FBI. If Doug already seems too far down the road to redemption to lend ""The Town"" much traction as a character piece it has outstanding virtues as a straightforward crime procedural. As in ""Gone Baby Gone"" Affleck conveys the ferocity of violence onscreen without resorting to gratuitous excess and the frenzied gunplay of the multiple action sequences -- aided by Robert Elswits rough-and-ready cinematography and Dylan Tichenors agile editing -- strikes an ideal balance between kineticism and clarity. Pic has a real feel for the neighborhood and uses it inventively; a car chase at the midway point derives much of its impact from the claustrophobia of Charlestowns narrow lanes and high walls. Local slang peppers the tangy script (credited to Affleck his ""Baby"" co-scribe Aaron Stockard and Peter Craig) which revels in the sort of satisfying monologues and well-timed comebacks that tie it to an older more classical storytelling tradition. Hall a sympathetic presence from the get-go is eventually sidelined in a role that grows more conventional as the film proceeds while ""Gossip Girls"" Blake Lively almost unrecognizable here has fierce pained moments as the moll and single mother Doug has tossed aside. Postlethwaite wrapping his lips around an Irish accent radiates a sadistic malevolence and Chris Cooper makes a brief somewhat pro-forma appearance as Dougs father emerging from the shadow of a jail cell to impress upon us the steep price of a life of crime.
