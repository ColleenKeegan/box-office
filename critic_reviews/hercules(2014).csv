Were not talking Snowpiercer levels of intelligence but its far less aggressively stupid than say Transformers Age of Extinction or Renny Harlins recent megaflop The Legend of Hercules. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Ratners Hercules avoids many of the mistakes of Harlins picture though The Legend of Hercules would have been a more accurate title for Ratners movie which explores how the burden of being so very legendary weighs on Hercules (Johnson).Known for having completed most of his famous labors and achieving a level of adulation that he doesnt necessarily want Hercules and a ragtag group of fellow warriors are summoned to Thrace by Lord Cotys (John Hurt) who promises to pay them Hercules considerable weight in gold if theyll build and train an army to defeat the warlord Rhesus (Tobias Santelmann).Film Details Hercules RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time98 More Info Trailer The story is fairly straightforward and more importantly so is much of the action. The films centerpiece is a battle between the Hercules-led Thracian army and hundreds of tattooed axe-wielding C.H.U.D.s and its downright refreshing how classically its shot.Unlike Harlins Hercules film (and many other directors non-Hercules fantasy pictures in recent years) theres no post-300 speed-up/slow-down nonsense. If anything Ratner seems more inspired by the relative naturalism of Game of Thrones and while theres certainly plenty of CGI augmentation this particular battle scene takes place in broad daylight and appears to have been shot on location rather than in a studio in front of a green screen.The sense that actual humans are involved in an actual place confers a sense of urgency that pixels just dont have and that includes the films opening retellings of Herculess famous tussles against various monsters as well as the CGI-heavy climax. But that middle battle is surprisingly powerful in its earthy messiness give or take all the edits and lack of blood to get a PG-13.It also helps that Hercules has a strong lead in Johnson. Not just physically strong but with all apologies to Steve Reeves Lou Ferrigno and Ryan Gosling hes by far the best actor to ever play this role.Thats not damning with faint praise either. Johnson is genuinely talented. Hes often the best thing in bad movies and Ratners Hercules is at the very least pretty good. In addition to all the yelling and straining and punching of things which come with the territory the movie gives Johnson a lot to do emotionally in the quieter scenes and he can communicate a great deal with those big eyes of his.The picture also raises a question that most mythology-based action movies wont go near because nobody likes a buzzkill What if the myths are just that?Hanging over the picture is not only the question of whether Hercules is in fact the son of Zeus (a Zeus who never manifests himself in the films present day nor do any of the other gods or supernatural beings) but also the issue of whether Hercules really did slay the Lernaean Hydra or the Nemean lion or any of the other feats of badassery for which the masses adore him. (Though he did turn the lions head or at least a lions head into what may be historys first kitty hoodie.) Brett Ratner is not John Ford and Hercules is not The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance but for a big dumb late-summer action movie starring a former professional wrestler as a mythological strongman its refreshingly down to earth and thoughtful about the tension between fact and legend.

Youll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By John DeFore July 25 2014 Frat-boyish filmmaker Brett Ratner has the distinction of having made the worst ""X-Men"" film (""X-Men The Last Stand"") the dumbest Hannibal Lecter tale (""Red Dragon"") and the most boring ""Rush Hour"" sequel. Thats unfair Having cranked out all three ""Rush Hour"" films Ratner also made the least boring one. But if future film scholars ever chronicle the Great Hercules Boom of 2014 they are likely to credit him with the best of the bunch. Yes thats very faint praise as Ratners ""Hercules"" is competing with Januarys bomb ""The Legend of Hercules"" and a straight-to-video flick called ""Hercules Reborn."" But this outing does not suffer the epic badness one associates with films that arent screened early for critics and in fact it offers moments of actual entertainment. It simply fails to exploit its assets an amusing revisionist take on the mythological strongman and the charisma of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Johnsons incarnation of the hero is not actually the son of Zeus. Nor does he inhabit a world of supernatural beasts such as the nine-headed Hydra. Hes just a spectacular warrior whose feats have been exaggerated over years of retelling and who relies on his inflated reputation for his career as a mercenary. Leading a crew of five he lets his nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) rhapsodize about his famous uncle both to would-be employers and to opponents. These are hard times for the big H. He used to be noble fighting for a king he admired (Joseph Fiennes) and coming home to a lovely family. But all this was taken from him in an act shrouded in secrecy but still haunting Herculess dreams. These days hes motivated only by gold. He is offered a whole lot of the stuff to train soldiers for Lord Cotys (John Hurt) whose realm is being overtaken by a vicious army that may or may not include a band of centaurs. Hercules leads these men to victory in some conventional but not unexciting battles. But as with his own myth all is not as it seems. Hercules will have to reconnect with his heroic nature to deal with twists the script has in store. ""When the legend becomes fact print the legend"" goes the famous line from ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance."" But here what might have been an enjoyable take on the disconnection between reputation and reality -- taking advantage of Johnsons knack for poking fun at his own machismo -- relies too heavily on soggy psychodrama and self-empowerment folderol. (Its worth noting that the late Steve Moore who wrote the comic book series on which the film is based had disavowed this adaptation.) ""You just need to believe youre a hero"" says Herculess buddy Amphiaraus (the great Ian McShane wasted here). Soon enough Hercules performs a feat of strength that 10 real-life Olympians couldnt accomplish together contradicting the films whole premise. That climactic stunt is less enjoyable -- and less plausible -- than some Herc wields a pretty terrifying fang-topped club against hordes of villains; wrenches open the menacing jaws of a few wild animals; and pulls off a judo trick with a galloping horse that overshadows everything else in the film. He does all this in some beautiful settings with top-shelf cinematography by Dante Spinotti (who has shot many of Michael Manns films) doing justice to handsome sets costumes and scenery. The best Hercules movie of 2014 may not be much of a story but at least its visuals are more transporting than the moodily hyper-modern look of sword-and-sandal hits such as ""300"" and ""Clash of the Titans."" DeFore is a freelance writer. Hercules  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains violence occasional harsh language and a brief glimpse of nudity. 98 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Photo Credit AP / Paramount Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The Greek demigod helps save a troubled kingdom. (Rated PG-13 for violence language) BOTTOM LINE Another slow sluggish lead-sandaled adaptation of the Greek myth. CAST Dwayne Johnson John Hurt Joseph Fiennes Ingrid Bolso Berdal LENGTH 138 The title role in ""Hercules"" bears some relation to a professional wrestler and not just because hes played by one. In this movie Hercules (Dwayne Johnson) is a bit of a sham a sword-for-hire who uses his outsize reputation -- son of Zeus slayer of the Hydra -- to whip up crowds and pump up his price. He even wears a costume the invincible hide of the Nemean lion. ""If the hide is invincible"" says a skeptical Trojan ""how did he get it off the lion?"" Iolaus an ancient Greek PR whiz played by Reece Ritchie provides the answer an invincible sword of course.

Aside from recalling a classic routine from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" this brief exchange proves that ""Hercules"" has more wit and humor than its beef-packed posters suggest. ""Hercules"" is based on the comics by Steve Moore (a lesser-known but well-respected writer who died in March) and directed by the usually lively Brett Ratner (""X-Men The Last Stand""). Its clever setup promises a satisfying climax We already know that Hercules must become the hero he pretends to be. The movie has a gift in Johnson a dependable charmer plus a fine supporting cast in colorful roles. Among Hercules ragtag crew are the cynical Autolycus (Rufus Sewell) the archeress Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) the slightly louche Amphiaraus (Ian McShane) and a mute ball of rage named Tydeus (Aksel Hennie). As the sneering King Eurystheus Joseph Fiennes cribs from his brother Ralphs Voldermort in the ""Harry Potter"" series. Lord Cotys of Thrace who hires Hercules and his gang is played by the great John Hurt. Unfortunately the plot of ""Hercules"" heaves and grunts along interrupted by battle scenes that are visually impressive (whens the last time you saw someone pick up a horse and throw it?) but emotionally uninvolving. Rebecca Ferguson plays the distressed damsel Ergenia but theres no room for romance in all the sword-swinging. If ""Hercules"" had flexed its brain muscles a bit more it could have been far more entertaining. 122 MoviesHercules trailer PLOT The Greek demigod helps save a troubled kingdom. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 for violence language CAST Dwayne Johnson John Hurt Joseph Fiennes Ingrid Bolso Berdal LENGTH 138 BOTTOM LINE Another slow sluggish lead-sandaled adaptation of the Greek myth.

"Hercules | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hercules_2783 ) Hercules (United States 2014) July 25 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli These days it seems damn near everything is based on a comic book and not all the resultant cinematic material is worth the effort taken to adapt it. Certainly Hercules is a big-budget misfire of a sizeable order a visually busy but emotionally dead endeavor that wearies the viewer with endless computer generated special effects while failing to provide a scintilla of human interest. Director Brett Ratner has always been associated with spectacle but even for him this represents a misstep because the ""wow"" factor is muted. To be fair Hercules boasts an intriguing premise although little is done with it. In this world there may or may not be gods - that much is unclear and none makes a personal appearance - but Hercules (played by Dwayne Johnson with his best Schwarzenegger physique) isnt the son of Zeus. In fact hes an orphan. His reputation as a demi-god has been contrived over the years and it allows him to make good coin as a mercenary who trades on his image. Yes this could have led to an interesting story but that would have been a Ridley Scott movie not a Brett Ratner one. Instead we end up with Hercules and his band of five merry men (actually four men and one woman) agreeing to help Lord Cotys of Thrace (John Hurt) fight a civil war against a rebel with a reputation for sorcery. Hercules exacts a high price for his participation makes goo-goo eyes at Cotys daughter Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson) participates in a training montage then goes off to war. This involves two large scale battles. After the second one the movie realizes there are a lot of unresolved plot threads so it cobbles together their outcomes into a half-hour narrative mess that varies from slightly idiotic to downright moronic. However because were not supposed to be overly worried about logic we can settle back and enjoy a few more fight scenes. Hercules character arc to the extent that he can boast one takes him from the role of a cold-hearted mercenary who cares only about money to a principled hero. The scenes in which Hercules battles monsters - hydras Cerebrus etc. - are cheats. The represent either depictions of the tall tales told about the man or his visions. The closest he gets to fighting a beast is when he takes on three wolves. Overall this feels more like a hybrid of Conan the Barbarian and 300 (although it isnt as good as either) than a Clash of the Titans. Although its obvious for marketing reasons why Hercules sought a PG-13 reason theres an R-rated movie aching to burst out. Both Conan and 300 carried an R for sex and violence but the PG-13 requires Hercules to neuter both. I cant argue that the movie would have been appreciably better if it was awash in blood and boobs but it probably would have been more entertaining. This isnt a long film - less than 100 minutes - but there are times when despite all the ""action"" it drags. It will surprise no one that although Johnson does a capable job flexing his biceps as the title character his performance is less than memorable. Most of his co-stars are equally forgettable with a couple of exceptions. The amazing Ian McShane once again takes a nothing role (in this case one of the members of Hercules band) and makes something out of it. Rufus Sewell who is Hercules best buddy Autolycus does his best Harrison Ford/Han Solo interpretation. Neither John Hurt nor Joseph Fiennes presents an impressive villain although Peter Mullan stuck in the ""henchman"" role is thoroughly dislikeable. Hercules seems geared toward boys in the age 10-14 range who have nothing better to do than watch a big-screen version of stuff theyre used to seeing in video games. Having watched the movie in 2-D I cant comment on whether its better in 3-D but thats hard to imagine. If Johnson was hoping for this to be a breakthrough opportunity its back to the drawing board. The movie might have fun demythologizing its title character but once it gets past that point it doesnt know what to do and proceeds along those lines for another 90 minutes.

"Hercules a muscular addition to summer box office review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHercules a muscular addition to summer box office reviewHercules starring Dwayne Johnson is a surprisingly assured and watchable summer adventure featuring an appealing cast and some great 3-D effects.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentFri. July 25 2014Hercules Starring Dwayne Johnson John Hurt and Ian McShane. Directed by Brett Ratner. 98 minutes. Opens July 25 at major theatres. 14AIf youre feeling the summer box office is lacking muscle try Hercules a surprisingly satisfying blend of action adventure and swift plotting.Its surprising in part because the films distributors Paramount and MGM Pictures held the only press screening the night before the movie opened in theatres making it virtually impossible to get critics reviews into their traditional spot in Friday newspapers.Article Continued BelowThat doesnt usually augur well. Hercules is happily an exception to the rule.Directed by Brett Ratner best known for the trilogy of Rush Hour films as well as X-Men The Last Stand the film offers both a sense of intimacy in its portrayal of Hercules and his small band of mercenaries as well as a sense of grandiosity with its impressive battle scenes and sets.The story opens with a quick series of flashbacks as Hercules works through a trio of his legendary 12 labours (the Nemean Lion the Lernaean Hydra the Erymanthian Boar) to appease the goddess Hera the wife of Zeus his alleged father.In the present Hercules is commissioned by Lord Cotys to rescue Thrace from a marauding army led by Rhesus purported to be a centaur. This being ancient Greece separating myth from reality is a rather tricky proposition.Actually this is an integral part of the script. Is Hercules a demi-god or just a regular flesh-and-blood guy with massive strength (and the body to prove it)? Its an intriguing idea and one that adds to the richness of the story. When Hercules nephew Iolaus volubly recounts some of his epic adventures the big guy is inclined to roll his eyes and smile.Ratner has assembled an impressive cast starting with Dwayne Johnson as Hercules an actor with the on-screen charisma to match his impressive physique. Theres also Ian McShane for semi-comic relief as Amphiaraus an augur (or seer) who gets precious few tantalizing hints from the gods to see the future.Toss in Rufus Sewell as the Spartan Autolycus Ingrid Bolso Berdal as the archer Atalanta Aksel Hennie as the mute but fierce Tydeus and youve got a very appealing company of companions. John Hurt as Cotys and Joseph Fiennes as the rather prissy King Eurystheus simply add to the depth of an already strong cast.The script is far more intricate than expected in a good way with a few unexpected twists and a back story about our main hero and a tragic loss that engages our interest.Care and attention have clearly been paid to the costumes and the sets in terms of authenticity and director of photography Dante Spinotti delivers some nice panoramic views of rugged Hungarian landscapes subbing for northern Greece. The film looks great in IMAX and its a pleasure to report that the 3D effects are both impressive and mesh well with the action-filled story.The battle scenes are impressively choreographed and while there is a fair degree of violence it never feels gratuitous. The climactic scene when our hero bellows ""I am Hercules"" is actually rather stirring.Hercules (Dwayne Johnson) wielding his traditional club and wearing the mane of the Nemean Lion lays some hurt on an enemy warrior.

Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com 1124 a.m. MST July 25 2014Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson stars as the demi-god in ""Hercules.""(Photo MGM)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3/5 starsGive ""Hercules"" this much It knows what it is.And what it is is a meat-headed delivery system for action set pieces and Dwayne Johnsons brand of smirking heroics in a blissfully unserious take on the legend of Hercules Greek demigod son of almighty Zeus.And for a spell it seems like the movie is going to be a lot of dumb fun opening with an eager over-the-top history of the legend and the 12 labors Hercules slaughtering Hydra and other cartoonishly designed CGI mythical beasts emerging from the flames draped in a lions pelt.But that gleefully dumb fun doesnt last long. ""Hercules"" puts a human spin on Greek myth. And humans as directed by perpetual frat boy Brett Ratner are kind of boring.Hercules isnt really a demigod you see just a super strong dude -- hes a god in reputation only. Hes also a mercenary fighting battles with a friendly band of warriors (one of whom is a scantily clad woman who bares her midriff like its armor) in exchange for gold so he can retire and live out his days in solitude and ruminate on the slaughter of his wife and children of which he has been accused.That means one final score. Hes commissioned by the lord of Thrace (John Hurt) to defeat a tyrannical warlord named Rhesus who threatens his kingdom. Things are not as they appear of course and demigod or not with his weight in gold on the line Hercules has to do some soul-searching and decide how much of a hero he really is.Its boilerplate heroics the kind of movie where someone says ""The people need a hero."" The battle sequences are equally undistinguished busy blurred melees that bleed into one another in a world where anything magical or mythical is a delusion a trick of the light.It has all been so done. But still theres a welcome lack of pretension to the proceedings. Stalwarts like Hurt and Ian McShane are on hand to class up the joint -- everyones got a British accent except for Johnson -- while the predictable story bludgeons its way towards an inevitable conclusion.Its all just fun enough. And depending on how big a fan you were of ""Deadwood"" its worth the price of admission to delight in McShanes performance as a smart-aleck soothsayer exclaiming his PG-13-allotted swear words with relish.Critics rating 3/5 starsCast Dwayne Johnson John Hurt Ian McShane.Rating PG-13 for epic battle sequences violence suggestive comments brief strong language and partial nudity.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Hercules--which stars Dwayne Johnson as the brawny bearded hero of Greek myth--is a scaled down club-and-sandals movie with a good ratio of scenery-chewing to choppy-shutter-angle skull-cracking. Its also a half-hearted but largely admirable attempt at a revisionist take on the subject where the supernatural elements are confined to dream sequences and silhouettes suggesting a world prone to viewing itself in mythological terms. Centaurs are really just men on horseback the Hydra merely a group of bandits who wear monster masks and Hercules isnt a demigod. In fact he isnt even one person. The ""real"" Hercules is a team--consisting of Autolycus (Rufus Sewell) Amphiaraus (Ian McShane) Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) and Tydeus (Aksel Hennie)--who use their leaders name and fame to secure mercenary work with runt nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) acting as their PR machine rattling off stories about slain monsters and divine blood to anyone within earshot. The movie--adapted from The Thracian Wars a series by the late British comics mainstay Steve Moore--is packed with ambitious ideas about how to tell a Hercules story while holding on to the notion that heroism isnt fated but is instead the result of people making decisions and working together. Johnsons Hercules functions like a star in a collaborative medium; his face and name draw crowds and cash but when it comes down to it hes just another hard-working specialist in a team full of them. Too bad then that these ideas are mostly sidelined by a brisk--but largely unremarkable--ancient Greek adventure which finds the Hercules unit accepting an assignment from Cotys (John Hurt) king of Thrace to train his army in exchange for their leaders weight in gold. Its a ""one last score"" type deal; the payout will be enough for the team to quit the mercenary trade and for Hercules--a fugitive from Athens where he is accused of killing his wife and children--to retire to a quiet farming life on the Black Sea.Unsurprisingly Johnson makes for a perfect movie-star Hercules and the film gets a lot of mileage by playing his charismatic-but-modest take on the character off of the strong predominantly British cast. (Peter Mullan and Joseph Fiennes pop up in smaller roles.) Equally unsurprising is that fact that Brett Ratners direction of the action scenes--though more spatially coherent than the Hollywood norm--rarely rises above the merely serviceable. Hercules may be a smarter movie than either Paul W.S. Andersons Pompeii or Renny Harlins Hercules The Legend Begins (whose title gets mocked in the dialogue) but it lacks the formers sense of scale and spectacle and never accomplishes anything as visceral as the latters opening shot.

Travelling with a Magnificent Seven-style band of warriors who are lured by riches to defend the beleaguered kingdom of Lord Cotys (John Hurt) the mighty man is still haunted by nightmares of the three-headed Cerberus and he mourns the murder of his wife and children -- though there are those who whisper that he himself killed them. When Johnson is wearing the head of the slayed Nemean lion in battle walloping enemies with his tree-trunk sized club and heaving charging horses to the ground with remarkable ease hes in his Rock comfort zone. But as a tortured hero hampered by self-doubt Johnson labors. Hes aiming for the gravitas of Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Gerard Butler in 300 but he races through the moments where Hercules has to be vulnerable or jaded. And since hes the lone person in B.C. Thrace -- a city-state populated by Ian McShane Joseph Fiennes and Rufus Sewell -- who didnt go to British boarding school his careful enunciation sounds especially out of place. Hercules might seem like the perfect role for The Rock but the movie really needs a better Dwayne Johnson. C?

"Review Dwayne Johnsons Hercules packs action-filled punch - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Dwayne Johnsons Hercules packs action-filled punch ""Hercules"" Kerry Brown Paramount Pictures Dwayne Johnson left stars as ""Hercules."" Dwayne Johnson left stars as ""Hercules."" (Kerry Brown Paramount Pictures) Gary Goldstein Dwayne Johnson fits the demigod bill in Brett Ratners Hercules Was anyone waiting for yet another movie incarnation of the tale of Hercules especially given that Renny Harlins poorly reviewed sub-spectacle ""The Legend of Hercules"" was unleashed in theaters a mere six months ago? The quick answer probably not.That said the mythically powerful demigod is back on the big screen in the simply titled ""Hercules"" and the results are canny fast-paced and for what the film attempts to accomplish enjoyable. If at first blush it feels as if casting Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as the mighty son of Zeus was more inevitable than inspired the truth is the part fits the big guy like a glove. Without putting too fine a point on it Hercules is Johnsons King Lear or Willy Loman; an iconic aspirational role thats been long-simmering in his wheelhouse.And if its not exactly an acting stretch for the ex-wrestler Johnson brings a deft physical urgency and larger-than-life nobility to this ancient superhero. He takes the part seriously no question. But theres also a playful quality to his performance that mitigates the kind of ponderousness often associated with these roles. The script by Ryan J. Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos based on the graphic novel ""Hercules the Thracian Wars"" by Steve Moore deconstructs some of the characters mythic history primarily Is he really the spawn of Zeus or is that just a bunch of BC baloney? And if he is a mere mortal -- albeit one with melon-sized biceps and the power to destroy a lion with his bare hands -- does it matter as long as he delivers the goods?

Though the crowd lining both sides of Hollywood Boulevard greeted him with chants of ?The Rock? outside the TLC Chinese Theatre Dwayne Johnson is ready to step into the ?Hollywood film ring? as a new character Hercules. (Haley Goldberg) Hercules reimagining here also includes a past haunted by the mysterious death of his wife and children three years earlier. The trauma has turned the Greek legend he of the famed ""12 Labors"" into a rootless mercenary exchanging his fighting skills for sacks of gold. His latest job involves helping the benevolent Lord Cotys (John Hurt) and his fetching daughter Princess Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson) end a brutal civil war in the land of Thrace a task that will of course prove easier said than done.Though he leads the charge Hercules is aided immeasurably by a devoted circle of fearless fighters who provide not only physical and moral support but nice doses of wry humanity. They include aging soothsayer Amphiaraus (Ian McShane) childhood friend Autolycus (Rufus Sewell) Amazonian warrior Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) the feral Tydeus (Aksel Hennie) and Hercules nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) a charming storyteller and nascent soldier.Director Brett Ratner keeps a firm grip on the films formidable CGI-enhanced epic action sequences as well as its few quieter moments smartly keeping things moving apace with propulsive skill. At a compact 90 minutes plus end credits theres no time for dawdling yet the story -- or at least this particular chapter of it -- feels satisfyingly complete. The movie is also visually compelling thanks to veteran cinematographer and frequent Ratner collaborator Dante Spinottis (""X-Men The Last Stand"" ""Red Dragon"") vital lensing Jean-Vincent Puzos vivid production design the efforts of VFX supervisor John Bruno and astute editing by Mark Helfrich and Julia Wong (the pairs cutting of a late-breaking scene involving a potential beheading and death-defying rescue is bravura work).And for those who want their Hercules to loom even larger the films Imax 3-D presentation where available is crisp and gorgeous if not entirely essential.-----------------------HerculesMPAA rating PG-13 for epic battle sequences violence suggestive comments brief strong language and partial nudityRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Dwayne Johnson Hercules (movie) Dante Spinotti John Hurt Hero vs. superhuman Hercules to battle Lucy in weekend box office Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hercules-movie-review-20140726-story.html,200,hercules(2014)9,hercules(2014),latimes
"No Brain No Gain << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The All-Bad Contracts Team  Next Sports Movie or Not a Sports Movie? Facebook Twitter Print Movies No Brain No Gain Scarlett Johansson is inhuman again in Lucy while Dwayne Johnson is wasted in Hercules. by Wesley Morris on July 25 2014 Lovers of Scarlett Johansson savor the opening minutes of Lucy. Shes sucking on a straw outside a bank in Taipei. Her haircut is short but big and curly and entrancingly blonde. The mischief in her eyes matches the tinge of trouble in her low rich voice. The jungle cat-print jacket seals the deal. She looks like everybody Madonna has ever played in a movie -- but at the same time. The bozo boyfriend shes talking to really wants her to help him out but shes like ""I totally have to study"" and hes like ""Come on babe. Help me out and take this briefcase in there."" Theyre kind of playing. Theyre kind of not. Suddenly he gets weird on her and cuffs her to the case causing Lucy to flash a look of terrible shock. Yada yada yada Lucys a skittish drug mule for Korean gangsters. When the drug leaks into her system she goes from using 10 percent of her brain like the rest of us to using all of it. Some chick studying abroad becomes the Future of Civilization. Or whatever it is Luc Besson is going for with this. Lucys rising intelligence is inversely proportional to the movies. But its stupidity has the kick you expect from the man whos been writing and producing Taken movies. For once Morgan Freeman is not the voice of omniscience. Hes a baffled scientist whose tens of thousands of pages of research Lucy read in an instant. Shes on her way to his Paris lab and shes dragging with her a bewildered cop (Amr Waked) a few of his men and all of those gangsters led by Choi Min-sik. Besson is having some queasy fun. Isnt this just a white lady running from a bunch of crazy Asians? Once the movie has an uncomprehending Lucy shoot a Taiwanese guy for comedy. Much of the reason the opening scenes are so good has to do with a loose breezy Johanssons dominating performance. Hearing that voice come from that face seeing her playing a person revved me up. I didnt know whether to dab my eyes or fasten my seat belt You mean shes not going to be software or a man-killing seductress-alien? Thank you Luc Besson. But it doesnt take long for the light in Johanssons eyes to dim and an action film to take her over. The more brilliant -- and telepathic telekinetic and daring like a 1970s stunt driver -- she becomes the less human she is. Theres no malice in Bessons use of Johansson. He can be a zigzagging amusing feminist director building spectacles around everyone from Anne Parillaud and Milla Jovovich (each of whom were at one point his wife) to Michelle Yeoh as the shut-away Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi to Michelle Pfeiffer as the head of nuclear family of assassins. He likes his idea of female power which is like male power but in sleeveless tops. One letter separates Lucys name from Bessons. You just have to ignore the double meaning of that letter ""y."" What you feel from Besson to Johansson is an absurd love. She fascinates him just as deeply as she does Spike Jonze in Her and Jonathan Glazer in Under the Skin. Taken together the films constitute some kind of investigation of her essence and sexuality of the fantasy her stardom presents. But she seems very much a partner in that exploration not a victim of it. All the probing is making her stronger as a performer. Its not mere carnality she projects in these movies its variations on wonder What can I do as an alien life-form pretending to be a beautiful woman? What can I do with a role that denies me physical form? Johansson does more than experiment in these movies. Shes terrific in all three. Its just curious to me that filmmakers as different as Besson Glazer and Jonze are interested in her as something other than human something beyond it. And in The Island she was a clone for Michael Bay At the risk of indelicacy you wonder what female directors would see in Johansson at this point. Its not as if she hasnt been good as a civilian or what passes for one. I liked her as Black Widow for Marvel and thought her zookeeper in Cameron Crowes last movie We Bought a Zoo showed her talent starting to crest. In Joseph Gordon-Levitts Don Jon Johansson seemed to be working at a sharp new angle. But what might she and Sofia Coppola achieve in a rematch? Where would the stress fall on her range? Lucy doesnt give Johansson much to do as an actor. Touchingly Besson seems to think that in order to give her all the power in the world he has to take away her skill. When the drug starts to do funny things to Lucy on an airplane Besson even risks taking away her beauty not to punish her but to punish us. Thats temporary. For most of the films back half Johansson can be seen waving her arms like wands and sitting perfectly still while wearing a little black dress. Holding on to that body feels like an act of willful sentimentality. Whats wrong with this movie? Its a cut above this springs Transcendence in which the Internet is infected with the Johnny Depp virus. That movie believed it was saying something but it was too wimpy to take its point about overconnectivity to some exciting or disturbing extreme. It had Freeman in the same role but no vision. Besson has too many visions. This movie worries that humanity is wasting its potential which is a bizarre fear for a movie that has this many nonsensical shootouts. But thats what on Bessons mind the Big Bang and bang-bang. Its simultaneously fun and extremely boring up to something provocative and yet the same old same old. Still some of that same old is fun. How many directors have left one of the five-star hotels on the Rue de Rivoli and thought whats been missing for all of these centuries is a car chase through the famous arcades? Well Bessons gone and done it. Subtlety is his kryptonite. Here and there he spikes the action with shots from the animal kingdom mice stepping onto a cheesed trap a cheetah trotting off with an antelope dangling between its fangs. In one of the opening shots prehistoric man is crouched by a lake waiting perhaps for a plunk from the bone in 2001 A Space Odyssey. The movie rumbles through time and space sending dinosaurs pyramids and nebulae toward Johansson and us. Theres both amazement in these shots and braggadocio. Its as if Besson sat through a half-hour of Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life hit fast-forward and thought I can do that but with drugs and guns and car chases. Malick gave us gaseous galactic emissions. Besson is farting. Theres a great movie in Brett Ratner. [Stops typing. Backs away from computer. Braces for strike of lightning. Nothing? Resumes.] He might never allow himself to make it. He might not even believe he can. (He might think After the Sunset and The Family Man already are great.) But you look at the battle scenes in Hercules and after wondering why youre watching yet another of these sequences in which hundreds of real and digitized fighters run toward each other you notice how navigable they are. Most of the cutting keeps the action matched so that when a character tackles an extra you can follow the approach impact and thud. The clubbing and stabbing and leaping Its all senseless yes but its assembled in a way that makes sense too. Working with the cinematographer Dante Spinotti for the ninth time Ratner even shoots the scenes in daylight which adds a touch of honesty to the action. Continuity and clarity are absurd things to single out for praise. In the homes of most directors even so-so ones thats called filmmaking. But even in something as run-of-the-mill as this the crispness of some of the staging is impressive. Its a crispness that eludes men like Christopher Nolan and Peter Jackson. Even so until the campy action-movie scenes in the last 25 minutes I was bored -- and honestly no matter how well put together one of those melees is if youve seen one youre all set. This Hercules (Dwayne Johnson) is not a persecuted demigod (most of his 12 labors have been completed) but a woebegone warrior ""from the streets of Athens."" Rumor has it that his wife and children were slain by his own hand. Obviously the rumors will be dispelled. In the meantime hes moonlighting with a band of five acolytes (including Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell) roving Thrace while doing mercenary work for sacks of gold. It sounds like the gist of a bad 1980s show on todays Starz. (Coming this winter The Slay Team) In this episode a woman named Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson) comes to Hercules on behalf of her father Lord Cotys (John Hurt). He needs his agrarian subjects trained for war against Thrace. Hercules and the acolytes agree to help and together they create a farmy. But the plot twists and Hercules finds himself in chains at which point the movies energy picks up along with its sense of abandon. Presumably the credited screenwriters (Ryan J. Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos) will hear that the last quarter is livelier than the first three and say they were building toward that last act. What theyve built is basically as strong as a coat of paint. And yet they should be a little proud of this greasy script. Theyve conflated Greek history and mythology -- or adapted Steve Moore and Admira Wijayas graphic novel that did. The writing has amusing lines for McShane and Sewell and a bitchy part for Joseph Fiennes as the King of Athens to tip into Cleopatra. That last scene is unsurprising but its also fun. There just isnt enough of that. Really Hercules wastes Johnson. Hes got the right body for the role (redonkulous) but deploys the wrong temperament Hes too passive too agreeable. You dont want to hear Johnson with lines like ""never retreat"" and ""advaaaaaaaaaance"" not when Hurt Sewell McShane Fiennes and Peter Mullan as a shady general are using toothpicks to pluck scenery from between their teeth. Johnson wears a brunette wig and makeup that doesnt always completely hide his body art. (What was I saying about continuity?) Hes been given one anachronistic line of foul language and whether or not it was in the graphic novel it seems included because the U.K. actors had all the fun stuff to say. This feels like something Johnson might have done 12 years ago when he was still wrestling full-time as the Rock but wanted to bank on his movie-star charisma. That smile of his is great in the ring. Its right up there with Julia Robertss. In films though its often more like a grimace. The point of leaving the Rock behind was to keep Johnson out of stuff like this and to take more risks like the juiced-up idiot crook he played in Pain amp; Gain. We know he can shove a towering statue onto a fleet of men. For years thats basically what he did for Vince McMahon. Of course he also needs a hit and Hercules should do it. But you leave underwhelmed. He and Ratner should be doing more than pushing over fake marble. They should be pushing themselves.

The legendary demigod helps an ancient Greek city prepare for battle. Director Brett Ratner (138) PG-13 Graphic violence language. Area theaters. The omens werent looking good for Brett Ratners ""Hercules."" For one thing it wasnt screened for critics until hours before it opened. Also Ratners exaggerated swagger was starting to feel dated by his last movie 2011s ""Tower Heist."" And besides Renny Harlin already gave us ""The Legend of Hercules"" earlier this year. Isnt one new movie about a muscle-bound demigod enough? Well put down your swords and pull out your sandals Ratners version with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in the title role is fast-paced funny and packed with - to indulge in a bit of ad-speak --eye-popping action. The omens werent looking good for Brett Ratners Hercules. (Photo credit Kerry Brown/Kerry Brown) The effects are impressive but there are none bigger than the stars biceps. As Ratner cheerfully acknowledges The Rocks preposterously oversized bulk is perfectly suited to a preposterously oversized movie. Johnson makes his entrance wearing a conquered lions head and a loincloth skirt. The fact that he can pull this look off sets the tone for everything else to come. The effects in Hercules are impressive but there are none bigger than Dwayne Johnsons biceps. (Photo credit Kerry Brown/Kerry Brown) In adapting Steve Moores graphic novel screenwriters Ryan Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos upend the legend by suggesting Hercules may just be a mortal with great PR. Since everyone believes hes the spawn of Zeus he exploits the myth as a high-paid mercenary. Fortunately theres plenty of chaos in ancient Greece keeping him and his team (played amusingly by Ian McShane and Rufus Sewell among others) busy. Their latest gig is in Thrace where the King (John Hurt) and his daughter (Rebecca Ferguson) need urgent protection from enemy armies. Promised his weight in gold Hercules agrees to the task. He trains the Thracian army and sets out into battle. But not even McShanes mystic seer can predict the outcome. Dwayne Johnson makes his entrance wearing a conquered lions head and a loincloth skirt. You might though because Ratners hardly forging new territory. He just wants to make a big loud fun summer blockbuster. Of course thats harder to do than it sounds. Often the words ""loud"" and ""blockbuster"" combine into an empty obnoxious headache of a cash suck. (Speaking of which Imax and 3-D glasses are worthwhile splurges here.) But like Tom Cruise The Rock is one of those actors whos always fully committed to his audience. No he doesnt try to match the British accents of the rest of the cast. And yeah he has a little trouble selling the more serious scenes. But he never ever forgets that weve paid good money to be entertained. Hercules screenwriters Ryan Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos adapted Steve Moores graphic novel for the film. (Photo credit David James/David James) Likewise the filmmakers are smart enough to know that theres nothing duller than a self-serious epic -- even one with an estimated 100 million budget. The one thing theyre missing are actresses a single bland woman warrior (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) and Fergusons eye-batting love interest stand out mostly for their rarity in this testosterone-fueled setting. That said Ratner does gives us plenty of amusing asides a high-quality good-humored cast and several grand action scenes. Unless he and Johnson plan to spring for our popcorn too itd be hard to ask for much more. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

At the Dissolve Keith Phipps writes that ""this surprisingly entertaining film brings out the best of everyone"" while Vultures Bilge Ebiri says ""It has a playful heart and spirited cast and little else but that turns out to be (mostly) enough."" Roger Ebert said that a good movie should be more entertaining than having dinner with the cast and with ""Hercules"" thats a tall order I thoroughly enjoyed it but Id trade those 98 minutes for a night of boozing with Dwayne Johnson John Hurt and Ian McShane in a Thracian minute. What makes ""Hercules"" a good deal of fun if not precisely ""good"" is the way that camaraderie carries over onto the screen. Johnson is as Tim Grierson writes in his Deadpsin review is somewhat hamstrung in the title role despite the fact that the movie is more interested in undermining Hercules mythic stature rather than puffing it up. (The central conceit is that the legends are just that and the real Hercules is a crafty mercenary smart enough to let the tales of his prowess raise his asking price.) But Hurt as the king of a city-state who engages Hercules and his band to defend them McShane as an eccentric seer and Rufus Sewell as Hercules snarky sidekick rip into their roles with gusto and wit. Sewell who never misses an opportunity to deflate the gravity of a moment is to the sword and sandal genre as ""Airplanes"" Steven Stucker is to the disaster movie. Its perplexing to use the word ""wit"" in relation to a Brett Ratner movie and not follow it with the suffix ""-less"" and there are moments when the frat-boy auteurs characteristic ham-handedness is in full effect. But for the most part ""Hercules"" is more bawdy than crass commendably undermining the pomposity of ""Gladiator"" and the glossy fascism of the ""300"" movies. The battle scenes which stress Hercules skill as a tactician more than his brute strength are cogently choreographed and smartly edited -- far more so than in the forthcoming superhero movie I saw immediately beforehand. ""Hercules"" de- and re-mythologizing plays like an ancient Greek version of ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" and while its nowhere near as crafty as John Fords seminal Western it manages to humanize the legendary half-God without simply dragging him down to earth. Its a movie of heightened style -- late in the game a character cries ""Unleash the wolves"" in a manner evoking ""the Simpsons"" Montgomery Burns -- but not as airlessly slick as some of Ratners more polished turds. It would be silly to make great claims for ""Hercules"" and counter to its anti-legendary spirit but its substantially better than the studios decision to play Hot Potato with critics would lead you to believe.

"Hercules review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Hercules  Hercules Kerry Brown Paramount/MGM Dwayne Johnson in ""Hercules."" Dwayne Johnson in ""Hercules."" (Kerry Brown Paramount/MGM) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Director Brett Ratners ""Hercules"" respects your time and your bloodlust. It slices through 97 insanely violent PG-13-rated minutes in a sort of extended digital blurt pausing just often enough for Dwayne Johnson to reload his guns (not that kind the other kind) or for John Hurt (as the king of Thrace) to rasp ""Unleash the wolves"" because Liam Neeson already said ""Release the Kraken"" in the ""Clash of the Titans"" remake.The picture is yanked from leftover parts of ""Gladiator"" ""300"" ""The Expendables"" and who knows ""Police Academy VII Mission to Moscow."" The script by Ryan J. Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos works from the five-part Radical Comics saga ""Hercules The Thracian Wars."" The Hercules we see here is not the traditional mythological wonder but an ordinary human at least by Dwayne Johnson standards -- a former street urchin (Rufus Sewell offering nicely cured ham plays his lifelong comrade) who joins the Athenian army acquits himself and eventually becomes a mercenary for hire. Hes looking for one last score so he can put his bloody past behind him and retire peaceably to the Home for Aged Greek Landmarks and Former Professional Wrestlers. Hercs gang is a lively and varied bunch. Ian McShane plays the mystic Amphiaraus whose intimations of his own mortality turn out to be amusingly off-base. The Norwegian actress Ingrid Bolso Berdal gives Xena Warrior Princess a run for her money as the Amazonian warrior Atalanta a dab hand with a bow and arrow. Hercs nephew (Reese Ritchie) is a balladeer of sorts spreading the Hercules-as-demigod stories everywhere they go.A beleaguered princess (Rebecca Ferguson) makes Herc and company an offer Help my dad the king fight our enemy Rhesus (Tobias Santelmann)and well reward you handsomely. One training montage later the ragtag Thracians learn to be part of an effective fighting unit. Ratners movie works the same way. Its contradictory and playfully anachronistic bits somehow feel like part of the same breathless unpretentious enterprise. Ratners sense of humor is never clever or light and Ive hated my share of his earlier films but not this one. (Or ""Tower Heist."") Hes enough of a low-rent showman to keep the spears and arrows and blades and clubs aimed right at your face over and over and over. ""Dont just stand there kill someone"" Sewell says at one point. One wonders if he Hurt and McShane sat around the set in between takes competing in a raspy-but-charming bellowing contest.mjphillipstribune.com""Hercules"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of intense combat action and violence and for some sensuality)Running time 137Now playing.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert The mightily entertaining ""Hercules"" manages to put a new spin on age-old mythology. Taking its inspiration from the Radical Comics reinterpretation of Greek lore it recasts the great warrior as a mere (but supremely buff) mortal. All that talk about his divine ancestry demigod status and those impossible twelve labors? Just so much public-relations hot air spun by his silver-tongued nephew. Dwayne Johnson perhaps the only actor around who can look superhuman and self-deprecating at once wears the title role like a custom tailored lion skin. Here hes a soldier for hire fighting for honorable causes when theyre available and as a mercenary when he needs to. With a group of fighters including an Amazonian archer a wily soothsayer a sly knife expert and a nonverbal berserker Hercules allies himself with Thracian King Cotys (John Hurt) whose realm is threatened by marauders. Thats his story anyway. In this tightly plotted tale though things are not often what they seem and the motives of the powerful are always suspect. There is as much skulduggery and back-stabbery in this version of ancient Greece as in a season of ""Game of Thrones."" Notions of what makes a just battle change as the story evolves just as the standard version of Hercs exploits and tragic back story get intriguing twists. There are tales of centaur armies and the three-headed devil dog Cerberus which have unexpected reality-based explanations. Yes this is a stunt-heavy adventure but it has surprises up its muscle-filled sleeve. Theres plenty of offhand humor too. Director Brett Ratner (""Rush Hour"") keeps the pace skipping along while finding time for our heros sidekicks to slip in some engaging character comedy. Ian McShane is wonderfully droll as the groups prophet. Hes nonchalant in battle because hes foreseen his own death but never gets the moment right. Rufus Sewell projects a strong personality as the pragmatist of the outfit willing to sell the outfits services to the highest bidder. Danish star Aksel Hennie (""Headhunters"") is near-unrecognizable as a silent facially scarred wild man popping his eyes in an expression both intimidating and nutty. Johnson has some nice light moments too complaining that hes ready for retirement because civilization is getting too civilized. The movie even works in a satirical jab at the recent Kellan Lutz misfire ""The Legend of Hercules."" The unusually classy supporting cast includes the British actors Peter Mullan and Joseph Fiennes who can snarl comic-book dialogue as if it were Shakespeare. The real meat and potatoes of the film are the epic battle scenes staged with widescreen sweep energy and attention to geographical logic. When fiery arrows rain down from the skies or chariots race through crowds of combatants youre never puzzled about point of view. Saturday matinees were made for this. HERCULES  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for epic battle sequences violence suggestive comments brief strong language and partial nudity.

By Bilge Ebiri Follow BilgeEbiri Starring Dwayne Johnson as the titular mythological man. 127 Shares Share 77 Tweet 48 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo Kerry Brown/Paramount Pictures Hercules has no right to be as entertaining as it is. Its dumb choppy cheap-looking and it even somehow manages to waste the Rock ... but this big-budget jettisoning of the Greek myth based on Steve Moores Radical comic is also a million miles from the self-important grandiosity of the 300 films or the over-CGId garishness of Clash of the Titans. It has a playful heart and spirited cast and little else. ButA -- and maybe this is just what George W. Bush called ""the soft bigotry of low expectations"" speakingA -- that turns out to be (mostly) enough. Instead of being another extremely loose retelling of the traditional tale of the demigod (the putative child of Zeus and a mere mortal queen) forced to complete 12 superhuman labors Brett Ratners film dispenses with the mythology in its opening scenes. It begins with highly stylized storybooklike images of Hercules (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) accomplishing some of his infamous feats and then reveals them to be a fanciful tale spun by Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) Herculess nephew who has assumed the role of myth-maker and hype-man for his uncle. The real Hercules you see is merely the brave musclebound leader of a ragtag group of mercenaries with diverse backgrounds and skills -- among them a business-minded flying-dagger expert (Rufus Sewell) a statuesque Amazon with sick archery skills (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) a mute berserker-style lunatic (Aksel Hennie) and a spear-wielding soothsayer (Ian McShane). Together this wisecracking group of crazy-brave fighters goes around taking jobs for gold and using made-up tales of superhuman powers and supernatural beasts to strike fear into their enemies hearts. (""The more they believe Hercules is the son of god the less theyre likely to fight."") Its a savvy little setup Those opening images of Hercules fighting the Nemean lion and slaying the Lernaean hydra have the obligatory slo-mo sturm und drang weve come to expect from these pimped-out movie variations on mythology. But once its undercut -- once were introduced to the real Hercules and his merry band of warriors -- its as if a great weight has been lifted. The movie starts to have fun. Related Stories Photos of the Rock Making Normal-Size Things Look Small As you might expect our heroes soon take on a job that turns out to be more than they bargained for when Thracian Lord Cotys (John Hurt) hires them to help him rid his kingdom of an army of deadly centaurs. Though skeptical of this whole centaur thing (they know that most tales of mythical creatures are a sham) Hercules and his fellows nevertheless start to train Cotyss army of farmers to become real fighting men -- teaching them archery and versing them in the importance of a properly formed shield wall. (In fact the film spends so much time on shield walls that I half expected to see the Shield Wall Association of North America listed as a co-producer.) Heres the most surprising thing about Hercules The Rock isnt particularly notable in it. Im a fan of the guy and hes likable here but at times he seems buried behind that beard and that ill-advised mane of hair. But the supporting cast takes up a lot of slack and much of the films pleasure comes from watching Herculess team get their individual moments of lighthearted cavalier bravery. They certainly enliven the films battle scenes which are otherwise something of a mess. Ratners never been particularly good at staging action but he has a flair for comic timing and a fondness for dumb sight gags. Thus the action scenes in Hercules work best when theyre fragmented into little moments taking our secondary heroes absurd ease with bloodshed to comical heights. Put another way Its really hard to hate a movie in which Ian McShane leisurely mows down enemy soldiers like grass with a chariot decked out in massive blades. Earlier this year Renny Harlin released his take on the Hercules mythA -- an overstylized shouty humorless piece of piffle starring an inert Kellan Lutz. It felt like a waste a talented director ignoring his strengths in an attempt to recapture some lost cache. Ratner who is nowhere near the director Harlin was in his prime makes no such mistake At times during Hercules you could swear that youre watching a comedy and the film has clearly been steered towards humor. One wonders though if the directors hand has been forced; theres a rushed quality to the movie that feels like it may have been heavily sliced and diced in post. Particularly during some very very brief flashbacks to Herculess life back in Athens and the grisly fate of his original family it feels as if were seeing castaway pieces from a bigger more ambitious movie. But weve seen that movie before over and over again. This Hercules is fine for what it is -- a fun disposable trifle.

And though its not the second coming of 300 this Hercules ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) proves surprisingly knowing of the legend -- and surprisingly willing to tweak it.Johnson plays our sun-dappled hero the kind of role with which he launched his career in The Mummy franchise. He may be 42 but Johnson looks as fit as he did in 2002sThe Scorpion King.

So Hercules forms an army out of disorganized peasants and farmers.Johnson was born for this kind of kick-butt-with-a-smirk role. In one scene he appears to throw a charging horse over his shoulder and it somehow doesnt look hokey.Yet Ratner is the one who surprises. The veteran of the Rush Hour franchise makes a seismic leap from the grand-scale aesthetics of 2006s X-Men The Last Stand.

TWITTER Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays the mythical Greek hero in Brett Ratners action-packed epic. A movie based on a comic book or a graphic novel cries out for brevity yet this years Captain America The Winter Soldier is 136 minutes while The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is 142 minutes and the new Transformers runs almost three hours. COVER STORY The Drive (and Despair) of The Rock Youll have to say one thing for Brett Ratners production of Hercules This movie has a sense of proportion. Running just over 90 minutes the movie is often clunky but at least its fast and unpretentious. And its likable star Dwayne Johnson manages to murder legions without ever seeming sadistic. Less violent than 300 less compelling than Gladiator this new addition to the sword-and-sandals genre seems likely to please the fanboy audience and stir up some impressive box-office numbers. The film begins by recounting the legend of Hercules with snippets of his famous 12 labors. But this is not the Steve Reeves version of the tale. Johnsons Hercules (as envisioned by comic book author Steve Moore) is a flawed hero. Bereft over the murders of his wife and children Hercules has joined up with a band of loyal comrades who will basically sell their services to the highest bidder. In other words theyre mercenaries. But you can bet it wont be too long before Hercules rediscovers a noble purpose. That happens when he is enlisted by the lovely daughter of the lord of Thrace to save her kingdom from civil war. Let the mayhem begin. PHOTOS Exclusive Portraits of Hercules Star Dwayne The Rock Johnson The story has a few twists up its sleeve as heroes turn out to be treacherous and villains are more complex than first appearances suggest. Theres just enough plot to keep the movie lurching forward and there are plenty of battle scenes to delight connoisseurs of carnage. (The movies PG-13 rating seems fairly lenient.) One problem with these battle scenes is the frenetic editing an unfortunate staple of contemporary action pictures. On the positive side the sets (by production designer Jean-Vincent Puzos who also designed one of Ratners favorite movies Amour) are impressive and the crowd scenes even if enhanced by CGI stir happy memories of films like Spartacus and Ben-Hur. The classy cast also elevates the picture. Ian McShane gives a droll performance as a soothsayer whos always surviving predictions of his own death. John Hurt is working in the glorious tradition of Claude Rains in The Adventures of Robin Hood while Joseph Fiennes is doing a Basil Rathbone as his venal confederate. As the one woman in the troupe of mercenaries Ingrid Bolso Berdal wields a mean bow and arrow. Tobias Santelmann (star of the Norwegian Oscar nominee Kon-Tiki) has an imposing presence as Hercules antagonist-turned-ally. Some of these actors have won awards but a trip to the dais is not likely to be in the future for our star. Still Johnson plays his role with good humor and more conviction than Steve Reeves could ever muster. When he finally breaks free of his chains and bellows ""I am Hercules"" the audience responds with just the right degree of childish glee. PHOTOS The Redemption of Brett Ratner Photos of the Hercules Helmer There are some neat 3-D effects but as with so many recent 3-D offerings the format doesnt seem absolutely essential. The cinematography by Ratners frequent collaborator Dante Spinotti is vibrant and the musical score by Fernando Velazquez is rousing. Most important the pacing is snappy. It may sound like a backhanded compliment to praise this sometimes cheesy movie for never taking itself too seriously but in a summer of bloated spectacles this modesty should not be underestimated.

"Hercules Review Ratner and Johsnon Put a Human Spin on the Mythical Greek Strongman | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Hercules Scott Foundas Chief Film Critic foundasonfilm 14 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr July 23 2014 | 0620PM PT The mythical Greek strongman gets a refreshingly human spin in Brett Ratners grandly scaled solidly entertaining popcorn pic. On paper Brett Ratner sounds like such an improbable choice to direct a large-scale ancient Greek epic that going into his ""Hercules"" one could only hope for a less aggressively preposterous affair than Renny Harlins bargain-basement ""The Legend of Hercules"" from earlier this year. The happy surprise is that Ratners ""Hercules"" is more than a mere improvement on its predecessor. Its a grandly staged solidly entertaining old-fashioned adventure movie that does something no other Hercules movie has quite done before It cuts the mythical son of Zeus down to human size (or as human as you can get while still being played by Dwayne Johnson). The result is a far classier pic than Paramounts frenetic trailer -- and decision to hide the film from reviewers until the 11th hour -- foretold albeit one that will struggle to find its sea legs at a crowded and underperforming summer box office. Overseas prospects look sunnier. Ratners film owes its counter-canonical premise to the late author Steve Moore whose five-issue Radical Comics series ""Hercules The Thracian Wars"" proffered a Herc who was markedly more man than god his supposedly divine paternity a useful legend but perhaps no more than that. Screenwriters Ryan J. Condal and Evan Spiliotopoulos have sanded down many of Moores rougher edges (including his Hercules volatile temperament and bisexuality) for this more family-friendly enterprise but theyve built on the idea of the warrior hero as a self-conscious mythmaker inventing practical real-world explanations for all of his seemingly superhuman feats. If the gods exist theyre nowhere to be seen here. The multiheaded hydra Hercules reputedly slayed during the second of his storied 12 labors has become a band of marauders disguised with serpentine masks. And what of a supposed army of half-human half-equine centaurs? Or Cerberus the three-headed dog of Hades? All can be explained as mere tricks of the light or the mind while Hercules dutiful nephew and self-appointed biographer Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) transfigures the narrative into legend as he spreads it up and down the Greek countryside. The stories prove good for business Hercules being in the mercenary-for-hire trade which he practices in concert with a quartet of trusted confidants Autolycus (Rufus Sewell) a childhood friend who rose with the orphaned Hercules through the ranks of the Athenian army; the fearsome Amazonian warrior Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal); shell-shocked mute Tydeus (the impressive Norwegian actor Aksel Hennie from ""Headhunters""); and mystical seer Amphiaraus (a superbly hammy Ian McShane) who sees much but is at a loss to unravel the mystery of the violent incident in Hercules past that turned him from conquering hero into restless wanderer. The group has a relaxed Hawksian interplay with touches of humor -- Amphiaraus who claims to have presaged his own death keeps misjudging the timing of the fated event. They also have one sole objective a last big score that will allow them to settle into early retirement. (Civilization Hercules muses has become too much to bear -- which considering were still in the Iron Age is really saying something.) Opportunity knocks in the form of Princess Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson) who implores Hercules and his cohorts to come to the aid of her embattled father the kindly King Cotys (John Hurt) whose kingdom of Thrace finds itself at war with the powerful sorcerer Rhesus (Tobias Santelmann). So off to Thrace they go with the objective of turning Cotys population of tenant farmers into a skilled fighting army. In terms of sheer scale and craftsmanship ""Hercules"" represents something of a quantum leap for Ratner who until now has seemed most comfortable at the helm of lightly diverting 80s-style buddy comedies (""Money Talks"" ""Rush Hour"" ""Tower Heist"") and who appeared profoundly out of his element on the profitable but incomprehensible ""X-Men The Last Stand"" (2006). But Ratner has clearly learned a lot about large-scale action directing since then. ""Hercules"" consists primarily of three elaborate battle scenes held together by some quickly dispatched exposition and the first -- and grandest -- of them is a genuine stunner. Arriving at the smoldering remnants of a village seemingly destroyed by Rhesus army Hercules troops find themselves ambushed by legions of steely-eyed warriors in camouflaged body paint (think several thousand Col. Kurtzes from ""Apocalypse Now"") and the violent rumble that ensues is staged by Ratner and ace cinematographer Dante Spinotti in clean coherent pieces of action that build steadily in intensity. Were a long way away here from the disorienting whiplash effect of most modern action movies as sweeping overhead vistas give way to carefully framed medium shots and closeups that hone in on specific bits of action. Bone and sinew smash against swords and chariot wheels. Arrows rain down from the skies (and in the unusually good 3D conversion right into the audience). Shields and armor clang resoundingly on the Dolby Atmos soundtrack. And while the battle proves devastating for those on both sides viewers may find themselves exhilarated and slightly giddy at the end of it. If ""Hercules"" isnt quite as compelling off the battlefield as on it certainly never dawdles clocking in at just under 90 minutes (sans credits) and keeping ever mindful that the audience for a movie like this is there for the big guns (or in this case the big swords) and not the small talk. Ratner holds his ambitions in check He isnt trying to make his ""Gladiator"" or ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" here and for all the handsome craftsmanship he never tries to deny the Hercules storys intrinsic schlock value. At its best the movie harks back to the unpretentious fantasy adventures of an earlier era chiefly Columbia Pictures programmers like ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963) and ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" (1958) right up to a fiery pit of doom finally complete with flaming torches plummeting iron gates and one character enthusiastically bellowing ""Unleash the wolves"" (All this before someone gets crushed by a giant stone bust of Hera.) Ratner was smart to stack the cast with the kind of classically trained British pros who can make a line like ""Unleash the wolves"" sound faintly Shakespearean. But ""Hercules"" strongest asset is surely Johnson who continues to foster one of the most affable guileless screen personas in movies today. Johnson may have been born with screen presence wired into his DNA but hes gradually cultivated the skills of a canny actor who knows just how to play to the camera and whose brute physical prowess is cut with a sly self-awareness. More than anything else its he who gives this Hercules his human-sized soul. Among the uniformly top-drawer craft contributions longtime James Cameron collaborator John Bruno merits special mention for his wonderfully tactile detailed visual effects work as does production designer Jean-Vincent Puzos (""Amour"") for his sprawling storybook sets.

JC says July 26 2014 at 1016 pm This movie is the the epitome of garbage. A complete false advertisement from the trailers which make you think the movie is about Hercules and his quest against the 12 labors which are summed up in the first 5 mins of the movie. Boring fight scenes and incoherent story. There is a reason it wasnt screened for critics before the movie came out. This movie is a perfect example of why piracy is rampant in the film industry. trash Reply Frederick Southwell says July 26 2014 at 905 pm I really loved and enjoyed this movie. It was well balanced with great action classy humor grand picturesque natural scenaries and an engaging story. I gave high marks for the choice of actors and their acting; Hercules physique was jaw-dropping fantastic. The special effects were wonderful as well. My only significant criticism was that some of the movie scenes appeared a bit murky hazy and sub-lit. Reply globalskope says July 25 2014 at 1029 pm This review tells me nothing about the movie.. Not as good as I expected as I just sawit last thursday. Characters like Zeus and Hera and the gods are NEVER shown in the movie only discussed. Therefore think some of the characters were lacked. Also centaurs are mentioned many times in the movie but none of them ever confront or chat with anyone they are only a backround thing. It tried to have a storyline the action was nice. It was just missing the feel of hercules communicating with the gods and also I didnt expect hercules to do with the evil king that fast usually he says ""killing doesnt bring family back. Anyway 2 1/2 stars for The Rock and this movie. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says July 25 2014 at 317 pm Like many early James Bond films HERCULES may well deserve technical nominations but this film ignores the the heros bisexuality involving a boy named Hyllus. Avoiding the issue is typical narrative-al-carte by studio marketing. Reply rjbailey says July 25 2014 at 912 am Reblogged this on Locating Frankensteins Brain. Reply Jesusisthe1 says July 24 2014 at 1049 am Hi Im nobody- an ordinary mortal who is a huge Dwayne Johnson fan. Thrilled hes being recognized as the awesome actor he is Reply Steve UK says July 24 2014 at 534 am Ratner has stuck to his ethos that all movies should be about 90mins in length. If he was directing The Ten Commandments it would still finish below 100mins and probably be retitled The Five Commandments. Reply John Daker says July 23 2014 at 1131 pm Bisexuality is a ""rough edge""? Okay. Reply Sophie Doherty says July 24 2014 at 112 am Well mooted Mr Daker. Reply crookedmindframe says July 23 2014 at 1116 pm I was confident this would be a disaster like the earlier released Renny Harlin effort after I caught a glimpse of the trailer thankfully I was proven wrong and I look forward to some goofy dumb fun this weekend Reply Chris Darling says July 23 2014 at 921 pm Good for all involved; especially Brett Ratner who has had an amazing year. Reply Carmine c courtney says July 23 2014 at 654 pm Epic production. Using Dwayne is Hercules. Awards coming. Great Movie. Cheers Herc. Reply jedi77 says July 23 2014 at 1107 pm Awards coming? Even the above rather positive review seems quite clear on this point This is not an awards worthy movie its a low script/high action pic. Reply Adam Roger Kearley says July 24 2014 at 227 pm That doesnt mean anything best adapted screenplay art direction cinematography costume design film editing makeup sound editing sound mixing and visual effects are all categories which have almost no reliance on dialogue or depth of story and thats just the Oscar categories the Academy adds new categories practically every year. From what Ive seen in the previews alone all of the aforementioned are categories this film will probably belong in. Though Dwayne probably wont get any recognition as far as acting is concerned the film and crew could still win awards.

Dwayne Johnson (were no longer allowed to call him The Rock) plays the title character who - in this loose adaptation of Steve Moores comic book series - is a mercenary warrior who uses inflated tales of his divine parentage and epic labours to psych out his enemies. Hired - along with a ragtag band of sidekicks who include a seer (Ian McShane) a wisecracking archer (Rufus Sewell) and a Swedish ninja with dreadlocks (Ingrid Bolso Berdal) - to defend the kingdom of Thrace against a mysterious enemy Hercules soon finds his past coming back to haunt him in the form of Joseph Fiennes sporting a worrying blond mullet. Given that its director is the widely derided Brett Ratner (Rush Hour X-Men The Last Stand) its no great surprise that Hercules is a complete mess the plot barely hangs together the characters are meagrely sketched and the 3D digital effects are plasticky indistinct and wearying to look at. The script contains a handful of decent comic asides and theres one great mid-battle moment where Herc throws a horse but on the whole this is decidedly non-legendary.
