Why else would the trio devote eight summers of their lives to a shot-for-shot remake of Spielbergs nadir? If imitation is the sincerest form of failure place this tribute to a fanboy riff on a fanboy riff at the bottom of the heap. Look and listen hard to dig up a motherlode of satirically contemptuous nuggets. An original script credits ""Stephen S."" (Some idol.) The boys stop patting themselves on the back only when their hands are needed to snuff out a crew member accidentally set ablaze. Lamb cites ""Jacques Cocteaus"" Beauty and the Beast as an inspiration. Even more embarrassing is the finished product portions of which I was once subjected to while volunteering at a local radio station. Unoriginal behavior such as this should be shunned not encouraged. Directed by Jeremy Coon and Tim Skousen. 2016. -- Scott Marks This movie is not currently in theaters.

(Drafthouse Films) In Raiders a pair of devoted fans finally realize their childhood dreams by recreating the iconic airplane fighting sequence of the original Spielberg classic.(Drafthouse Films) film review The sentimental Raiders follows two men recreating a childhood dream Add to ... Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 17 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Jul. 12 2016 129PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jeremy Coon and Timothy Skousen Starring Chris Strompolos Eric Zala Eli Roth and John Rhys-Davies Classification PG Country USA Language English If you see only one movie this summer see the movie about the movie it took seven summers to make. Hype? You bet. But the hard sell is warranted when it comes to a documentary with a high-flying title and an action-adventure blockbuster legacy attached. This is Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made a film devoted to coming-of-age summers grown-up realities and the running down of Spielberg-sized dreams with boulders chasing relentlessly behind. A little history first Steven Spielbergs Raiders of the Lost Ark a franchise-starting hoot involving Nazis treasure hunts and a globe-trotting two-fisted professor of archeology was released in June of 1981. Among the millions enthralled by the Harrison Ford-starring film were two Mississippi boys (Chris Strompolos and Eric Zala) who set out a year later to remake the movie shot-for-shot. The resulting Raiders of the Lost Ark The Adaptation filmed over the course of seven summer vacations was finally completed in 1989.In the early 2000s the school-boy Raiders remake was discovered and lauded by the film-word nerd class. Even Spielberg expressed his love of the low-budget fan film and the inspiring dedication involved in its making.In 2014 the cast and crew reunited to shoot the one scene - the originals airplane fight sequence - that was not completed in their youth. And now the documentary Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made endearingly chronicles the whole thing from the 1980s adolescent odyssey to the sobering adulthood present. Its a saga you bet your bullwhip.Raiders directors Jeremy Coon (Napoleon Dynamite) and Timothy Skousen have crafted something comprehensive in nature blending in a contextual backdrop with the teen-to-men lives of the two main fanboys. We learn of their broken homes (divorcing was ""just something parents did"" in the 1980s) and broken dreams. A rift between young actor Strompolos and the bullhorn-happy kid director Zala formed over a girl; their friendship survived their quixotic quest only by a shoestring.In a well-layered film that is a cross between Richard Linklaters Boyhood and a Goonies reunion funny bits abound. After an actor is set aflame Zalas divorced mother (scrambling solo to hold the household together) shuts down the production. The filming resumes the following summer but on the condition of adult supervision. That monitoring comes in the form of a laid-back Budweiser enthusiast who once served as an extra on the original Dawn of the Dead. Far from giving mature guidance the dude literally pours gas onto the fire.Commentary comes not only from the grown-up cast and crew of the adaptation but from film geeks that include actor-director Eli Roth and British thespian John Rhys-Davies who was in the original film. His garish narration is a bit over the top - too bad Spielberg wasnt corralled to participate instead.At times heartstrings are pulled too actively. Speaking about his fathers mission to film the ""lost scene"" Zalas young son - who adorably says ""I think its really neat that Steven Spielberg needed 20-million to make Raiders of the Lost Ark and my dad only needed his allowance"" - is shamelessly called upon to speak about how proud he is of his dad still chasing childhood dreams. Then again thats what the film is all about the suspension of ones wonder years and the revisiting and resolution of youths romantic missions.Just as the 1980s filming was complicated - no less than five giant rocks were constructed for the famous boulder scene - the 2014 shooting of the missing airplane segment was fraught by financial difficulties and poor weather. The lessons learned by those involved were just as hard won. ""We thought we were missing out on childhood"" a now grown-up cast member says. ""Turns out we were filming our childhood.""And so if angels give grace to fools and children as the film suggests wisdom is earned by years. Cue the triumphant Raiders theme music - lifes adventures are never done.

"Raiders fondly chronicles fanboys Indiana Jones quest - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Raiders fondly chronicles fanboys Indiana Jones quest ""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made"" Drafthouse Films Chris Strompolos as Indiana Jones in the documentary ""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made."" Chris Strompolos as Indiana Jones in the documentary ""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made."" (Drafthouse Films) Michael Rechtshaffen There are fanboys and then there are Eric Zala Chris Strompolos and Jayson Lamb a trio of Mississippi buddies who spent the summer of 1982 -- and their next seven summer vacations -- filming a shot-for-shot remake of Steven Spielbergs ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""Their obsessed exploits have been affectionately chronicled in ""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made"" a documentary thats just as fixated as the guys slavish adaptation. Back when the ""Raiders"" boys embarked on their quest at age 11 in the backyards of their Ocean Springs homes there was no Netflix or YouTube but that didnt prevent them from painstakingly re-creating the blockbuster save for one complex sequence. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Their story didnt end there. Turns out that videotaped dubs of their unfinished opus had been passed around over the years with one eventually making it into the hands of filmmaker Eli Roth who proved instrumental in reuniting the old team. Overwhelmed by that cult response Zala and Strompolos now in their 40s are determined to finally shoot that one missing sequence -- this time relying on a Kickstarter campaign to fund the special-effects-heavy nine-day-shoot.Keeping tabs on that rain-plagued production co-directors Jeremy Coon and Tim Skousen incorporate insights from Roth John Rhys-Davies (Sallah in the Indy movies) and family members suggesting that long-term escapism provided a catharsis for kids dealing with divorced parents and other issues aligning them more with ""The Goonies"" than Indiana Jones.Though indulgently overlong ""Raiders"" manages to unearth the inner geek in all of us.------------- Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever MadeNot ratedRunning time 1 hour 33 minutesPlaying The Cinefamily at the Silent Movie Theatre Los Angeles Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Steven Spielberg Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mini-raiders-fan-film-doc-review-20160613-snap-story.html,200,thegreatraid3,thegreatraid,latimes

Credit Drafthouse Films As its title boldly somewhat hopefully announces the documentary ""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made"" recounts the amusing ups and periodic alarming downs of a singular handmade project. In 1982 two Mississippi boys -- Eric Zala 12 and Chris Strompolos 11 -- set out to create a shot-by-shot remake of Steven Spielbergs ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" which had hit theaters the year before. For seven years as these boys became men they called action and rolled camera painstakingly feverishly recreating Indy and his high-flying adventures. Video Trailer Raiders of the Lost Ark A shot-for-shot side-by-side trailer for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark The Adaptation"" and the original film. By DRAFTHOUSE FILMS on Publish Date June 6 2016. Photo by Drafthouse Films. Watch in Times Video >> embed True enthusiasts sometimes cross the line between fan and fanatic; these kids vaulted over it deliriously. For them the remake wasnt a casual backyard frolic the kind that imaginative young minds generate after school and before dinner. This was a full-blown feature-length production with dressed actors and sets period detail and even dangerous pyrotechnic special effects. Eric created the meticulous storyboards partly guided by his surreptitious recording of the original movies audio (this was before home video took off) and served as the baby Spielberg. Chris put on a rakish fedora to play Indiana Jones running and cracking the whip as his body and voice changed.You can see the developmental phases slip and lurch by in the smeary charmingly awkward clips from the remake scattered throughout this documentary. Like latter-day versions of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn Eric and Chris were ingeniously resourceful. They brought in another friend Jayson Lamb as their cinematographer and special-effects specialist and together they turned a yard into a jungle stenciled hieroglyphics on walls and used a dog called Snickers to play the role that had been performed by a spider monkey in the original ""Raiders."" Summer after summer these friends convened as the early 1980s gave way to the late and Pac-Man gave way to Game Boy. Photo Eric Zala as Dr. Belloq. Credit Drafthouse Films The pleasure of the remake even when viewed piecemeal is that its a testament to the transporting glories of movie love to that passion that sweeps you up whether youre sailing over the rainbow with Dorothy or riding shotgun with Ripley into the abyss. Its a fever that can become a kind of madness send lovers soaring or spiraling and that sometimes turns fans into directors writers scholars programmers and even critics. Whats especially moving about ""Raiders"" though -- and which is evident in the snippets from the remake and the behind-the-scenes glimpses of the boys and their friends -- is that this passion is incredibly pure its their first love and their greatest.The documentary directed by Jeremy Coon and Tim Skousen revisits those tender years and what came after with a lot of obvious enthusiasm and not an ounce of critical distance as if they too were just two more friends playing along. This eagerness toward the adaptation is understandable given its ungainly charm but the problem is that the documentary isnt strictly about the remake. Too much of the documentary is dedicated to the adult Mr. Zala and Mr. Strompolos who when it opens are in the midst of trying to raise money to shoot a complicated effects-heavy scene of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" that they didnt pull off when they were teenagers. Photo A scene from ""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made."" Credit Drafthouse Films At first this new endeavor -- which involves blowing up a plane among other hurdles -- comes across as quixotic but it soon starts to feel like self-promotion. As the documentary details Mr. Zala Mr. Strompolos and Mr. Lamb are having an extended moment which began in 2002 when ""Raiders"" was screened at a festival in Austin Tex. The audiences thrilled reaction lit a long fuse Vanity Fair published an article about ""Raiders""; a fictional movie about its making was announced; and this documentary -- a fan film about the making of a fan film -- happened. Mr. Zala and Mr. Strompolos meanwhile started a production company -- and so it goes.""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made"" is not rated. Running time 1 hour 35 minutes.

MOVIE REVIEW Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made Running time 104 minutes Not Rated (adult situations). Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made"" shows how in the 1980s some kids spent parts of seven summers doing a shot-by-shot remake of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Imagine ""Moby-Dick"" rewritten in crayon and youll get the idea. If you actually had filmmaking talent youd make an original film (Steven Spielberg didnt spend his teen years reshooting ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"") but in this doc breathless cheerleading attends the two now-grown directors 30 years later as they try to do the one scene they couldnt do the first time the fist fight by the airplane. Fanboys gotta fan but beneath the surface ""Raiders"" is the opposite of what its trying to be -- not a salute to monomania but a lesson in its destructiveness. One of the directors became a drug addict and the other nearly lost his job on their lost crusade and when an explosion knocks out a bystander in the airplane scene it becomes evident that film nerds can be lethal in addition to boring.

Drafthouse Films hide caption toggle caption Drafthouse Films Chris Strompolos Eric Zala and Jayson Lamb pose with their broken-down prop truck they used in their shot-for-shot remake of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Drafthouse Films In recent years the word ""fan"" has become a pejorative in the movie world linked to mobs of entitled young men torching critics of comic-book blockbusters advancing sinister conspiracy theories and preemptively decrying the all-female Ghostbusters movie. To watch the documentary Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made is to be reminded that fandom can be about sincere passion friendship creative excitement and a relationship to art thats intensely personal. That the story begins in the Deep South long before the Internet existed probably helps. Beginning in 1982 a couple of boys from Mississippi 11-year-old Chris Strompolos and 12-year-old Eric Zala spent eight consecutive summers filming a shot-by-shot remake of Steven Spielbergs Raiders of the Lost Ark. This may sound like a whimsical endeavor akin to Rushmores Max Fischer Players adapting grown-up movies like Serpico for the stage but that would undersell the level of commitment they brought to the project. Unlike the Gus Van Sant remake of Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho which cheated constantly on its ""shot-by-shot"" promise Strompolos and Zala were methodical about seeing the experiment through. With no budget and jury-rigged effects they turned a 20 million action-adventure blockbuster into a Betamax wonder that grew from obscurity to the stuff of cult legend. Raiders catches up with Strompolos and Zala as middle-aged men who drifted apart as young adults and long-since shelved their dreams of becoming filmmakers. As kids their Raiders remake was an obsession borne partly of unsupervised playtime and partly as an escape from two broken homes which made Indiana Jones both an impossibly cool hero and an ideal of manhood their fathers couldnt muster. Summer after summer Strompolos and Zala along with their eccentric cinematographer Jayson Lamb would gather makeshift props and costumes and puzzle their way through sequences that had set a new standard for stuntwork and special effects. Directors Tim Skousen and Jeremy Coon structure the documentary around Strompolos and Zalas efforts to shoot the only scene they couldnt pull off as children the one where Indiana Jones squares off against a beefy adversary on an airport tarmac. Raiders nicely interweaves the bittersweet history of the remake with a behind-the-scenes look at the middle-aged Strompolos and Zala collaborating for the first time in decades. Finishing the movie might seem like a contrived attempt at ""closure"" for the documentarys benefit but as it turns into an unexpected quagmire the complexity of this project and this friendship starts to come to light. Along with the unfettered joy of living out Spielbergs fantasy came moments of danger and personal turmoil and the intervening years led to bitter estrangement as Zala forfeited his ambitions in exchange for fatherhood and a corporate job while Strompolos succumbed to cocaine and meth addiction. When geek royalty like Eli Roth and Harry Knowles helped bring the Raiders remake into the light at Knowles annual Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival in 2002 Strompolos and Zalas redemption arc was finally written. The one major problem with Raiders is that said redemption arc feels predigested with too many scenes that pop-psychologize their past and present and a conclusion thats satisfying but conspicuously tidy. Then again after finishing a project three decades in the making these fanboys have perhaps earned the right to engineer their own happy ending.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Pat Padua June 16 The boys now adults needed one final -- and complicated -- shoot to complete their fan-filmed remake of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" (Drafthouse Films) Hollywood thrillers promise a few hours of escapist adventure. But that pales in comparison to the long and arduous adventure of growing up. In ""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made"" directors Jeremy Coon and Tim Skousen tell the story of a group of boys who spent eight summers creating a shot-for-shot remake of Steven Spielbergs 1981 blockbuster ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" In essence the documentary celebrates a home movie -- one made by fans as an homage to a hit film -- that became a cult hit of its own. But as the now-adult crew reunites to attempt to shoot the one scene that they couldnt pull off as kids their childhood dream begins to look like a grown-up nightmare. The enterprise began when the boys were between 10 and 12 years old. Eric Zala the projects director was the driving force able to create storyboards from memory after one viewing. (This was long before home video would enable infinite rewatching.) His friend Chris Strompolos played Indiana Jones while another boy Jayson Lamb brought a knack for creating special effects on a shoestring budget. As Zalas son notes Spielberg spent 20 million to make his movie while Zala and his friends used only their allowance -- supplemented by in-kind contributions of Indys signature leather jacket and other crucial items which the boys requested for birthday presents. The teenagers film lacks slick production values and continuity. Characters grow incongruously older and younger throughout a result of the fact that it was not shot in chronological order. It feels like a shuffled homemade version of Richard Linklaters ""Boyhood."" [""Boyhood"" Richard Linklaters audacious epic cinematic journey] Eight years after the project began Zala and his filmmaking friends put away their childish folly and drifted apart. But years later their 1989 adaptation started making the bootleg video rounds landing in the hands of filmmaker Eli Roth who arranged to have part of the film shown at Austins 2002 Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival. The viral success inspired the crew to try and recreate a complicated airplane scene that had eluded their youthful ingenuity. They raised 58000 on Kickstarter. ""Raiders"" jumps back and forth between the tale of the original production and the effort to shoot the missing scene. Despite an adult-size budget and film crew Zala struggles with time and money constraints as well as the elements. The production loses days of shooting when it is beset by relentless storms. The story of the contemporary shoot is meant to be inspirational -- a look at a childhood dream deferred and then fulfilled. But the professionalism of the grown-up effort stands in marked contrast to the enthusiasm of the teenage amateurs that made their efforts so endearing. ""Raiders"" celebrates the obsessions of childhood suggesting that in this case they may have arisen out of a desperate need to escape broken homes. All of the now-adult participants reflect on their parents divorces. ""Its what parents did back then"" Lamb says matter-of-factly. Strompolos struggled more than the others not just with a physically abusive stepfather but -- after an adolescence spent conquering movie Nazis -- with his own drug abuse. In the 1981 film the holy grail for adventurer Indiana Jones was the Ark of the Covenant. For the boys who devoted their childhoods to remaking ""Raiders"" it may have been a happy home. Fortunately this seems to have become a reality. The films most profound subject matter may simply be the passage of time. Unrated. At AFI Silver.

Like ""Star Wars"" before it Steven Spielbergs ""Raiders"" (1981) perfected the art of pop cultural iconography drawing inspiration from action heroes of 1930s film serials to create a whip-cracking swashbuckling archaeologist in Indiana Jones.Most 80s kids coped with their obsession by donning a fedora and watching their VHS copies into oblivion. But that wasnt enough for childhood friends Chris Strompolos and Eric Zala of Ocean Springs Miss. At 11 they embarked on a quest to remake ""Raiders"" in its entirety scene for scene.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceIts the sort of lark kids come up with all the time. The difference here is that they actually did it. Weekends winter breaks summer vacations - all were devoted to the elaborate recreation of ""Raiders."" They meticulously storyboarded every shot. They recruited siblings and friends turned a basement into a bar that they set on fire. They swirled gauze around a fishbowl for ghosts. They engaged in misadventure with industrial plaster. They nearly did it.""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made"" documents a group of youngsters who created a home-movie version of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" (Photo Drafthouse Films)The kids grew up. Dreams fell by the wayside. Eric started a family and got a corporate job that didnt leave much room to pursue his filmmaking passions. Chris fell on much harder times getting hooked on cocaine and crystal meth and spending some time in jail. He eventually righted the ship got married settled into an unfulfilling job.But VHS copies of their nearly finished film had circulated and one ended up in the hands of director Eli Roth (""Hostel"" ""Cabin Fever"").  He in turn gave a copy to Harry Knowles professional film geek and coordinator of the annual Austin Tex. film marathon  Butt-Numb-A-Thon. The crowd of die-hard nerds and film obsessives loved it. Suddenly Eric and Chris were getting phone calls including from Roth.The outside interest rekindled a long-dormant fire. The project that had consumed their entire adolescence was complete save for one scene Indiana Jones fighting a buff Nazi under the whirring propellers of a fighter plane. The kids had found clever ways to re-enact other tricky parts of the film; they built five boulders before they got it right. But finding and blowing up a life-size plane proved an impossible task for even the most precocious of teens.Chris Strompolos (left) and Eric Zala hold their replica of the Ark of the Covenant in ""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made."" (Photo Drafthouse Films)But as adults with nest eggs understanding spouses and the ability to commission a replica plane? Anything is possible.""Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made"" documents the friends final push to finish their lifelong quest to bring closure not just to the project but to their troubled adolescences. Because their film of course isnt just a film but a metaphor. Those summer afternoons crashing trucks into trees and setting basements on fire werent just about recreating their favorite film but about escaping troubled family lives divorces alcoholism abusive step-dads.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestWhat hampers ""Raiders"" is its vociferous and tiring insistence on its own importance. A robust assortment of talking heads - Roth Knowles even ""Raiders"" actor John Rhys-Davies - exhaustively enthuse over the kids project as if we need constant convincing. We dont; the grainy and time-distorted VHS footage sells itself when the documentary lets it.""Raiders"" is as sloppy and imperfect as the kids shot-for-shot remake but it has much the same charm. And both capture the spirit of Chris and Erics childhood hero. Spielberg was a cinematic wunderkind a born storyteller with ingenuity coursing through his veins. Chris and Eric share that much in common and prove that you dont need millions of dollars Harrison Ford and continuity to make an awesome film. All you need is a Betamax and a dream.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

In the summer of 1982 three pre-teen kids in Mississippi--Chris Strompolos Eric Zala and Jayson Lamb--decided to make a shot-for-shot remake of Steven Spielbergs movie almost entirely from memory. (Home video didnt really exist yet when they started so they had no means of revisiting the original apart from a brief re-release.) This endeavor wound up consuming the next seven summers of their lives all the way through high school and into college. It was then forgotten until 2002 when director Eli Roth whod received a VHS copy from a friend years earlier brought it to the attention of Harry Knowles who showed the first 45 minutes or so during a meal break at that years Butt-Numb-A-Thon festival. The Adaptation quickly became a cult sensation with screenings in various cities across the country. Spielberg himself saw it and met with the now-grown filmmakers to tell them how inspiring he found their youthful enthusiasm. And then it was forgotten again in part because copyright issues make an ordinary DVD release and/or streaming deal impossible. Thats a shame as every Raiders fan should experience The Adaptation marveling each time those crazy kids succeed in replicating a scene (most notably the lengthy truck chase in the desert) that would seemingly be impossible for teen amateurs to pull off. One scene genuinely was too much for them They never did manage to film Indiana Jones (played by Strompolos in their version--part of the fun is watching his age change repeatedly over the course of the movie which was shot out of sequence) facing off against a musclebound bald Nazi inches away from a spinning airplane propellor. Raiders The Story Of The Greatest Fan Film Ever Made chronicles the trios belated effort just a couple of years ago to finally finish the project theyd begun over three decades earlier. At the same time the documentary serves as an oral history of their teenage adventures with participants reminiscing about the time they very nearly burned Zalas house down filming the scene in which Marions bar goes up in flames for example. Fair-use clips from The Adaptation provide at least some sense of what a mammoth undertaking it was.For a while Raiders seems like a poor substitute for the real thing. The oral-history aspect is standard talking-heads material (bizarrely edited by Barry Poltermann and co-director Tim Skousen who for some reason keep fading out on heads while theyre still talking) and the present-day shoot of the long-missing airplane scene lacks the adolescent charm thats always made The Adaptation so much fun--now its just a group of middle-aged dudes trying to achieve something without the requisite knowledge or experience. As the shoot repeatedly gets rained out however and Zala attempts to negotiate extra vacation days from his day job (with a boss whos clearly fed up with the whole thing and on the verge of firing him) the extent to which these men are still consumed with the abandoned dreams of their youth lends the movie a certain poignance. Orson Welles famously called filmmaking ""the biggest electric-train set any boy ever had"" and Raiders captures that spirit without inviting the mockery that say American Movie does. Yes these guys are in their 40s now working with an actual effects crew but theyre still essentially the same ardent idealists determined to make the impossible happen. Spielberg would surely still approve.

In 1982 that line was definitely crossed by three Mississippi kids who were so obsessed with Steven Spielbergs Raiders of the Lost Ark that they decided to remake it shot-for-shot. They didnt just love the film they wanted to become one with it. What the baby-faced trio lacked in funding and resources they more than made up for with the kind of DIY ignorance-is-bliss passion that only the young or truly deranged possess and their quest was as epic as Indys search for the Ark of the Covenant. It would consume the next seven years of their lives and ultimately leave their once inseparable friendship in pieces. Tim Skousen and Jeremy Coons new documentary Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made isnt the kids finished film. Its a film about the making of their film--and its amazing. Chris Strompolos Eric Zala and Jayson Lamb are all in their 40s now. Some have 9-to-5 careers and families but none seems to have lost the fiery wide-eyed zeal that made them first pick up a bullwhip and a clunky video camera 34 years ago. The film ostensibly chronicles how they reunited as adults to film the one climactic Raiders action sequence they never got in the can as kids. But what its really about is three grown men tapping back in to the best time of their lives to feel some of that childlike Spielbergian magic again.

In the introduction to the published compilation he wrote that he had a momentary impulse ""about some kind of wall-to-wall rewrite"" which eventually gave way to ""one of those episodes of middle-aged tranquility."" A rewrite just wouldnt have seemed honest. Such isnt the case for Chris Strompolos Eric Zala and Jayson Lamb three childhood friends who spent their summers from 1981 to 1988 making a now-legendary shot-for-shot remake of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Part of the films fun is seeing how they substituted makeshift resources for trucks Nepalese bars golden Aztec idols and Nazi uniforms. Its an astonishing accomplishment for a group of kids including pyrotechnics fights melting Nazis and a child dragging behind a truck. Film Details Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made RatingNR GenreDocumentary Running Time95 min. More Info But one scene was missing the knuckle-busting fight between Indy and a German mechanic amid the propellers of a spinning Nazi flying wing. There was just no way to shoot it. So Raiders a film documenting the kids effort is framed by the group now adults shooting the missing scene 35 years later. High-definition footage shot with actual money a full-scale replica of a Nazi airplane background camels and pyrotechnics all seems incongruous -- and a little bit like a betrayal of the kids they once were. EXPAND There was so much joy in their remake but Raiders is often dispiritingly preoccupied with adult issues of financing. But when they talk about their alienated childhoods broken families and absent fathers its pretty clear why their cinematic role model was so meaningful.Raiders The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made Directed by Jeremy Coon and Tim Skousen Drafthouse Films Opens June 17 IFC Center Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Chris Packham Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

TWITTER The story of the ultimate fan film. In these days of cheap DV and desktop editing software (not to mention middle-aged fanboys who never gave up their geeky obsessions) the fan film is commonplace. The web is full of homemade Star Wars Star Trek and comic-book movies some made with more conviction than the genuine article. Things were different in the early 80s when three pre-teens fell for Raiders of the Lost Ark so hard they decided to remake the film shot for shot. Their seven-years-in-the-making opus is a thing of legend and in Raiders Jeremy Coon and Tim Skousen get a lot of mileage out of its audacity. Their documentary is modest and sometimes clumsy as if made with the expectation that only the geek community would ever want to watch it. A more polished film would have better chances in the wider world. Read more Steve Jobs The Man in the Machine SXSW Review Raiders of the Lost Ark The Adaptation took seven years to make and was shot out of sequence meaning that its cast ping-pongs through adolescence onscreen their ages changing from scene to scene. They managed to finish the whole film save for one bit the fight sequence in which Indiana Jones battles a mammoth Nazi under and around an airplane thats about to explode. Now in their forties two of the three core filmmakers decide to make their film whole. We follow director Eric Zala and star Chris Strompolos as they plan the ambitious shoot spending tens of thousands of dollars (and in Zalas case putting his day job on the line) to build a 75-foot replica of that plane -- which they plan to blow up on cue after Indy saves his girlfriend Marion from its cockpit. Jayson Lamb an eccentric who was responsible for most of the teen crews effects work is excluded from this present-day shoot. As a result Coon and Skousen pay less attention to him than perhaps they should when recounting the 1980s production. The doc switches routinely from past to present charting the airplane scenes troubles (sample title ""Day 5 31 Shots Behind"") in between interviews with parents and neighbors who watched these men get their start as amateur filmmakers. Read more SXSW Jimmy Kimmel Wanted ABC to Cancel Jimmy Kimmel Live in First Year Happily nobody erased over the videotapes of unused takes meaning we get to see very funny failed gags and flubbed readings by 13 year-old actors. Parents briefly shut things down when a fire stunt went wrong but when production resumed it risked more mayhem than ever. Looking at the boys replication of the famous car chase in which Indy was dragged by a truck its a miracle nobody was maimed. Coon and Skousen supply just enough information about the boys post-Raiders lives to satisfy our curiosity and explain how the homemade movie was passed around on VHS dupes until it was discovered by film-biz types like Eli Roth. (Roth is interviewed here as is an admiring John Rhys-Davies.) Many years after they made it the boys got a chance to meet Steven Spielberg himself who had been given a copy of their tribute and reportedly told them he was ""inspired"" by their dedication.

Over the course of eight years they more or less completed the task and the result took on a mythological dimension. Eventually noticed by horror director Eli Roth the now-adult figures responsible for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark The Adaption"" enjoyed newfound appreciation for their accomplishment and eventually landed a meeting with Steven Spielberg himself. However as Jeremy Coons and Tim Skousens enjoyable documentary ""Raiders"" makes clear even then the story wasnt quite finished The boys never managed to shoot one crucial scene and in adulthood they finally attempted to finish the job. READ MORE The 2015 Indiewire SXSW Bible Every Review Interview and News Item Posted During Run of Festival The missing scene in which Harrison Fords character faces off with a muscular Nazi while propeller plane roars up behind them calls for a massive set of resources largely cobbled together by a Kickstarter campaign. The plan is at once ridiculous and endearing to watch. With a straightforward approach that often takes on the feel of a behind-the-scenes project Coons and Skousen shift between contemporary footage of the ambitious new shoot and the lively history of the original project which garnered some local media attention before the men drifted apart during adulthood. Its this surprisingly dark chapter in their lives that endows the movie with more appeal than the basic facts already out there. Once developed as a fictional project scripted by ""Ghost World"" author Daniel Clowes the ""Raiders"" story stretches beyond the adorable efforts of aspiring young filmmakers to find them haunted by its legacy. While the documentarys structure is somewhat uneven its protagonists remain fascinating subjects whose recollections -- along with backstories fleshed out by their wives and parents -- include revelations of much greater challenges than the movie itself. These include Strompolos struggles with drug abuse and Zalas frustrations with a corporate job that takes him away from his passions as well as the teen spats that ruined their friendship for several years. Only Lamb the eccentric effects wizard of the group maintains a relatively smooth ride. Even so none of them become hugely successful filmmakers and that outcome hints at a tragic foundation to the narrative. The bleaker details of their plight imbue the present-day attempt to complete their endeavor with a considerable amount of emotional resonance. Still the story wouldnt stand for much if the original project werent so impressive in the first place. (As Aint It Cool News founder Harry Knowles points out in the documentary ""The Adaptation"" is a finer shot-for-shot remake than Gus Van Sants similar treatment of ""Psycho."") Despite a certain underlying silliness to the premise ""Raiders"" successfully taps into the practical and personal trials involved in creative risk. Watching the men talk through their intentions its impossible not to get swept up in their desire to finish what they started. Once a playful fan film ""The Adaptation"" has taken on a much deeper significance in the lives of its creators and the movie takes that relationship at face value. READ MORE SXSW Review Uncle Kent 2 is the Craziest Movie Sequel Ever The documentary has a tendency to meander in parts and repeats a lot of the same observations about the personal significance of ""The Adaptation"" to the men but its closing moments make the investment worthwhile. Featuring stunning footage of a fiery accident on the set of the final recreation the new movie has a climax as exciting as any simulated action scene in the Spielberg original. By the end ""Raiders"" both consolidates the appeal of ""The Adaptation"" saga and helps conclude it. Grade B ""Raiders"" premiered this week at the SXSW Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution. READ MORE Angie Tribeca Delivers Crazy Gags and Great Guest Stars -- Who Needs Depth?

Theres a good reason why TV and movies have adopted the disclaimer ""Remember kids dont try this at home."" As inventive as they were impressionable pint-sized super-fans Chris Strompolos Eric Zala and Jayson Lamb nearly killed themselves on multiple occasions attempting to remake the first Indiana Jones movie breaking it down shot-for-shot and filming each scene as best as their limited resources would allow over the course of eight summers. The result has become the stuff of fan legend inspiring magazine articles movie deals and what feels like the perfect Hollywood ending which the geek-bait documentary ""Raiders"" reveals for the first time as the original trio reunite a quarter-century later to finish the airplane scene they deemed too difficult to film as kids. Often poignant occasionally pathetic but never short of entertaining ""Raiders"" captures the obsessive hold movies have on young peoples imaginations as exemplified by such pics as ""Son of Rambow"" ""Super 8"" and the upcoming ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl."" Today Zalas son is roughly the age his father was in 1981 when he and best friend Strompolos hatched their ambitious fan-film project. ""I think its amazing that Steven Spielberg needed 20 million to make Raiders of the Lost Ark and my dad only needed his allowance"" the kid says in the documentary which clearly shares that same charitable affection toward a project undertaken in total earnestness and executed with almost reckless naivete. It would be easy to treat Zala Strompolos and especially Lamb (their truly eccentric vfx maestro) as comic figures the way ""American Movie"" and ""The Disaster Artist"" presented their inept indie-filmmaker subjects. For directors Jeremy Coon (a producer on ""Napoleon Dynamite"") and Tim Skousen however ""Raiders"" represents something more than an excuse to poke fun. These two seem genuinely inspired by the kids story and eager to do it justice balancing a respectful retelling of how the project came to be (supported by amusing anecdotes and priceless outtakes) with genuinely encouraging coverage of the amateur filmmakers most dangerous stunt yet their decision to complete ""the lost airplane scene"" all these years later -- the one where the bald Nazi backs into the propeller and gets sprayed across the cockpit of the Flying Wing before everything blows sky-high. In many ways the story behind the ""Raiders"" adaptation has outgrown the film itself which is sampled somewhat sparingly. Back in 1989 Strompolos mom organized a small public screening of her sons home-movie tribute in Mississippi but the boys friendship was already on the skids -- for personal reasons which the documentary explores doing a remarkable job of not shying away from the double-crosses drug addiction and disappointments that followed (nor the divorces abuse and psychological motivations that likely enabled it in the first place). The trio had closed the door on that chapter in their lives when Eli Roth got his hands on a VHS copy of the film and brought it to Butt-Numb-A-Thon Harry Knowles 24-hour binge-viewing geekstravaganza in 2002. Considering that the revival began in Austin Texas its fitting that the ""Raiders"" documentary should be premiering there all these years later at SXSW where die-hards may actually feel the film skimps on key details. (It mentions the fire that nearly burned down Zaras house for example but skips over the failed attempt to make a plaster face cast that ended with Lamb being rushed to the hospital as described in Alan Eisenstocks book.) For other viewers however the sort who might sample a movie like this on Netflix theres no reason for ""Raiders"" to run longer than 90 minutes and a tighter cut than the current 105-minute version might be a good idea. This one features a wee too much gushing from the likes of Roth Knowles Alamo Drafthouse owner Tim League and others responsible for elevating this backyard tribute to cult status along with a bizarre interview with John Rhys-Davies whos shot head-on gut-first like a character in a Wes Anderson movie. The other talking heads get slightly more flattering coverage including one guy whos filmed sitting in a DeLorean. Still both Coon and producer Scott Rudin have expressed an interest in making scripted versions of the ""Raiders"" adaptation story and the docu digs deep enough to show where the heart of such a project could be. As cover versions go this amateur tribute cant touch the original ""Raiders"" (though the airplane scene which unspools over the end credits is a huge improvement over the VHS footage they shot as kids) but theres no question that it boasts a much better behind-the-scenes story -- one whose divided-family dynamic and corny group-hug ending further echo Spielbergs unmatched influence on a generation of filmmakers.

Scott Lionberger says July 4 2015 at 257 am I am postng a retraction on behalf of my oldest brother Doug Lionberger. Doug is not familiar with the adaptation nor the documentary flim. I explained that I have received credit in both films (Adaptaton film from Chris Strompolos Eric Zala; the Documentary from Jeremy Coon Tim Skousen) Regretfully Doug misunderstood. Scott C. Lionberger Reply Doug Lionberger says May 3 2015 at 109 pm Lets not forget that not all the actors (kids at the time) have been properly credited for the making of this film; specifically Scott Lionberger. Scott was in many of the stunts played an Indian and Dogman among a couple other roles in the movie. Too bad a fall out with these kids created some friction that led to some being dropped from the credits. Reply John Shea says March 15 2015 at 232 am So we can expect Temple around year 2020?
