"Dodgeball misses the mark. Slate Sign In Sign Up Dodgeball misses the mark. Dodgeball misses the mark. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 18 2004 557 PM Low Blow Dodgeball hits audiences over the head with its stupid juvenile (but sometimes funny) humor. By David Edelstein Nice pecs Ben The explosion of interest among grown men in dodgeball--i.e. throwing balls very very hard at people while trying not to get hit by balls being thrown very very hard at them--confirms what many of us have known for some time that American males would love to have a little toggle switch that would make them in an instant 12 years old. (Given their druthers theyd probably switch it back only to get laid and buy beer.) Its too bad that the new comedy Dodgeball A True Underdog Story (20th Century Fox) doesnt explore the psychology of this familiar character dubbed the ""rejuvenile"" by the writer Christopher Noxon. But the movie written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber is pretty much a manifestation of the rejuvenile phenomenon. Modeled on such slob-comedy 70s/80s hits as Meatballs (1979) and Caddyshack (1980) its coarse primitive regressive often very stupid and sometimes against all odds really a hoot. Just watching grown-ups get bombarded by rubber balls you know? Makes me feel 12 again. The movies premise is established so lazily that the script might have been written by its hero Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn)--a feckless neer-do-well who runs a cruddy Vegas gym Average Joes full of dweebs nerds geeks and for variety outright loonies like the guy who thinks hes a pirate and goes around saying ""Arrrr."" For some reason (most of the pictures plot turns could be prefaced ""for some reason"") the owner of an upscale corporate super-gym White Goodman (Ben Stiller) decides that he wants to put Average Joes out of business--although hed hardly want its clientele showing up at his place. He sneers ""In 30 days Ill be bulldozing that shit heap you call a gym into nothingness."" Faced with the demolition of their beloved gym/community center the dweebs/nerds/geeks/loonies decide to enter a national dodgeball competition in order to win 50000 to--Sorry its too demeaning to summarize. Advertisement So unfortunately is Vaughns performance. His character is meant to be noncommittal sloppy and dispirited but there must be a way to act those things without being them. Bill Murray the genius of the prototype brought an air of grace to degeneracy He really appeared to be on a higher astral plane far above such bourgeois concepts as hygiene and manual labor. Vaughn has no subversive wit no comic motor nothing. You want to see him slammed with balls just so hell react. Stiller at the other extreme has enough energy for 10 clowns. Its true hes insanely overexposed but at least this performance is a change of pace--a return to the demented extroverts he used to play on his old Fox variety show. Hes muscled up here with huge bronzed arms and a swollen chest--which means he gets to make fun of bodybuilder morons and still have us think ""Nice pecs Ben."" That said Stiller has always been disconcertingly built up like the quintessential runt in the Charles Atlas comic book ad who has had sand kicked in his face too many times. He uses that massive chip on his shoulder to give White Goodman real pathos. Every detail--from the feathery blond mane to the mutton-chop mustache to the toasty voice that keeps cracking to the gyrating pelvis--is an act of self-flagellation. The icing on this masochistic beefcake is that Stiller gets to put the moves on his own wife Christine Taylor (as a bank lawyer who ends up on the dodgeball team) who is repulsed by him to the point of nausea and who gravitates to the barely-awake Vaughn. The pictures wild card is Rip Torn--the ultimate chuckling nihilist bastard--as the wheelchair-bound dodgeball founder Patches OHoulihan who makes you laugh when he shows up and keeps you laughing until his untimely (and poorly staged) exit. Patches trains the team by pelting them with extremely heavy objects with the movies sound people helpfully overamplifying every bruising thud. The dodgeball competition sequences are a riot because theyre edited not for coherence (coherence and dodgeball dont go together) but maximum pain Bonk bonk bonk and lots of ouches and wounded glares. Nothing like getting slammed with rubber balls to bring out the blubbery child in a person. Dodgeball is junk but now and then its a scream--a primal scream.

"Stiller Vaughn Having a Ball washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Stiller Vaughn Having a Ball Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 18 2004 THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO requirements for a good lowbrow comedy. (Question Should ""lowbrow"" and ""good"" be in the same sentence? Discuss.) They are -- drum roll please -- a complete and almost blissful lack of taste but also the comic flair to raise it above the merely stupid and make it funny. Whoa. What are we talking about ""Citizen Kane""? Lets reverse out of this comic seminar and proceed directly to the movie which is ""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story."" Yes youd be right to assume this comedy is complete poison thanks to the 57th appearance of Ben Stiller in a movie this month. But darn it if the Stillmeister isnt pretty hilarious this time as the wonderfully repulsive White Goodman the 70s-coiffed spandex-attired owner of an exclusive fitness center called Globo Gym. (White suggests the lovechild of Eric Roberts in ""Star 80."") Hes not the only funny one. This is also a good movie for Vince Vaughn (who sometimes suggests a cross between the Cary Grant of ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and Bill Murray) as Whites indefatigable adversary Peter La Fleur. Peter is the lackadaisical owner of Average Joes a gym for the lumpy tubby meek and generally anti-Adonis crowd. But he doesnt pay his bills to the tune of 50000. Which suddenly makes him vulnerable to a hostile takeover by White who wants to raze Peters gym and turn it into a parking lot for his super gym. Peter is resigned to selling out until his clients rally including cheerleader wannabe Justin (Justin Long) Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk) and Gordon (Stephen Root) a mild-mannered middle-ager. Gordon comes up with an idea If they form a dodgeball team they can enter a national competition in Las Vegas. The big prize is of course 50000. Enlisting Whites disgruntled lawyer and softball veteran Kate (Christine Taylor also Stillers wife) and a former dodgeball great (Rip Torn) called Patches OHoulihan as their coach the misfits head to Vegas. But White who has some pretty bionic bodies at his command enters the competition too. He wants that old gym at any cost. The rest of the movie is a spoof on every misfit-team caper from ""The Longest Yard"" to ""The Mighty Ducks."" But writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber makes you forget convention and enjoy a genuine yukfest full of down-and-dirty (but funny) gags and one-liners and memorable scenes. The piece de resistance is when hard-bitten and wheelchair-bound coach Patches trains the incompetent team to dodge balls by throwing steel wrenches at their body parts. (Theres a good chance ""Dodgeball"" contains the most direct assaults on the groin in movie history.) He also makes them run through traffic. Gordons first dash across the busy highway isnt completely successful. The movies a treasure of small gems such as a parody of 1950s-era instructional films called ""PE Class"" made by the Nazi-esque Uber-American Films and featuring the young Patches or the inflatable codpiece that White manually pumps up when hes anticipating an attractive female visitor to his office. The movies also rich in face-to-face verbal standoffs especially between laid-back Peter and almost psychotically intense White who refuses to let his complete incompetence with vocabulary or the English language interfere with his self-adoration or misfired sarcasm. Its easy to overlook the fact that lowbrow comedy is hard to write without tumbling into the crude pit. In this movie Thurber has clearly taken the time to get things right. DODGEBALL A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY (PG-13 91 minutes) -- Contains obscenity and lewd crude humor. Area theaters.

"Dodgeball Contact Comedy washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Dodgeball Contact Comedy Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 18 2004 Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn switch their usual places in ""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story."" In most of their comic collaborations Vaughn has played the villainous smoothie while Stiller works up a clench-jawed head of steam as the put-upon loser. Here Vaughn is the hapless hero while Stiller happily hams it up as a fatuous pumped-up phony. The turnabout works at least to a point in this modestly amusing teen summer comedy. Vaughn plays Peter LaFleur the owner of Average Joes Gym where a gang of misfits gathers daily to escape domineering wives empty lives the cruelties of high school or just reality itself (one of the gyms patrons is totally accepted as the pirate he thinks he is). Across the street White Goodman (Stiller) holds court at Globo Gym a sleek purple-swathed palace of narcissism whose motto is ""Were better than you -- and we know it"" Goodman a former fatty oversees his empire through a combination of insecurity and overweening ego while sporting an absurdly puffy 70s hairstyle right down to the Fu Manchu mustache. When LaFleurs elastic bookkeeping habits result in Average Joes coming into foreclosure Goodman moves in for the kill buying up the mortgage to build an additional garage for his gym rats. LaFleur must come up with 50000 in 30 days to pay off the bank and as it happens one of his customers subscribes to Obscure Sports Quarterly; thats where the Average Joes learn about an upcoming dodgeball tournament whose purse happens to be exactly the sum they need. They begin training and their efforts land them in the heart of Las Vegas where they manage to win their way to the finals to meet their ultimate match Goodmans own Purple Cobras. The Joes motto Aim low. (The games by the way are broadcast on ESPN 8 the ""Ocho"" which gives the dodgeball playoffs all the graphic gravitas and breathless color commentary of the Super Bowl.) The funniest moments in ""Dodgeball"" belong to Stiller note-perfect as an arrogant fathead who tries to impress a pretty banker (played by Stillers wife Christine Taylor) by filling an inflatable codpiece and reading the dictionary (""I try to stay in mental shape too""). And writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber who makes his feature debut here sneaks in some improbably subtle humor such as a 1950s-era training movie produced by ""Uber-American Instructional Films"" that proudly describes dodgeball as ""a sport of violence exclusion and degradation."" Some of his jokes are so quick they almost disappear; ""Dodgeball"" may be the only bonehead comedy in history or at least this summer to refer in passing to Sappho and schadenfreude. But for the most part the movie is a series of setups for snickering sexual humor and vicariously aggressive ball-throwing. LaFleurs team winds up training with legendary dodgeball champion Patches OHoulihan (Rip Torn) by dodging wrenches and oncoming traffic; then they go head-to-head with teams from Germany Japan and the African American community. Those matches provide opportunities not only for countless sight gags involving mens nether regions but for some tired ethnic humor as well. Most viewers can predict what fun the filmmaker has with the object referred to in the title and its various double meanings but you have to see ""Dodgeball"" to believe what Lance Armstrong William Shatner and Chuck Norris are doing in the same movie. Balancing lightly between clever and stupid Thurber never quite manages to make ""Dodgeball"" soar but he never entirely lets it sink either. Dodgeball A True Underdog Story (91 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for rude and sexual humor and language.

First-time helmer Rawson Marshall Thurber working from his own script soft-pedals gross-out gags and full-bore raunch. Should score big enough with young males to ensure a leggy summer theatrical run. Call it Farrelly Brothers Lite. Very much in the tradition of ""Kingpin"" and ""Theres Something About Mary"" ""DodgeBall A True Underdog Story"" gleefully commingles slapstick and scatology satire and sentiment in a free-wheeling farce aimed at making auds laugh until theyre thoroughly ashamed of themselves. First-time feature helmer Rawson Marshall Thurber working from his own script soft-pedals gross-out gags and full-bore raunch yet still purposefully pushes pic into outer limits of PG-13 propriety. ""DodgeBall"" should score big enough with young males to ensure a leggy summer theatrical run and doubtless will earn post-season points as homevid bestseller and cable-TV staple. Indeed the only conceivable impediment to a B.O. victory lap would be mainstream audience resistance to dodgeball itself. After all this so-called ""sport"" is not-so-fondly remembered by many former grade and high school geeks (including a few who grew up to be film critics) as a source of physical pain and traumatic humiliation. However ""DodgeBall"" wisely taps into long-repressed resentments that may stem from memories of being pummeled with rubber balls in playgrounds and schoolyards. As its title implies pic offers underdogs a fulfilling fantasy of revenge. Functional plot pits under-achieving slacker Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) owner of the gone-to-seed Average Joes Gym against overbearing entrepreneur White Goodman (Ben Stiller) founder of an ultra-fashionable fitness center. Goodman seeks to acquire and demolish La Fleurs gym and construct a parking lot in its place. To keep the bank from foreclosing on his property and facilitating Goodmans schemes La Fleur must raise 50000 in 30 days. Forced to assume responsibility -- in all likelihood for the first time in his life -- La Fleur forms a competitive dodgeball team with a few of the more colorful misfits who frequent Average Joes Gym. He plans to take the team to Las Vegas to compete for a 50000 grand prize in a Dodgeball Championship. Naturally Goodman assembles his own team of bigger stronger and more lethally accurate dodgeballers. Fortunately La Fleurs team gets help from an unexpected source Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) an attorney hired by the bank to inspect La Fleurs books. She joins the Average Joe team to support the underdogs -- and more importantly to punish Goodman for his sleazily aggressive attempts to woo her. (Stiller and Taylor are married in real life and knowing that makes their scenes together all the more amusing.) The Average Joe team is whipped into shape literally by Patches OHoulihan (Rip Torn in his robust dirty old man mode) a wheelchair-bound taskmaster who barks insults and growls orders. Ultimately the good guys arrive at the Dodgeball Championship. The event is covered by play-by-play announcers (Gary Cole Jason Bateman) who are hilariously dead-on parodies of similar real-life commentators. ""DodgeBall"" takes about 20 minutes to achieve full speed and occasionally sputters and misfires even after getting of the ground. When its does work however it is explosively and shamelessly funny earning guffaws with everything from dodgeballing girl scouts to wacky cameos by well-known players. Among the latter oddly enough champion bicyclist Lance Armstrong turns out to be the biggest laugh-getter. Vaughn breezes through most of ""DodgeBall"" with engaging what-the-hell insouciance and manages to sustain his comic rhythm even when his character seeks ""redemption"" through selfless behavior. Sporting a power mullet Fu Manchu mustache and semi-buff physique Stiller comes off as a live-action cartoon which is pretty much what the script requires. Supporting players -- including memorably Missi Pyle as a unibrowed snaggletoothed Eastern European dodgeball ace -- give performances sharply attuned to broadly comic nature of material. Thurber most famous for the similarly sports-themed ""Terry Tate Office Linebacker"" TV commercials keeps his debut pic moving at a suitably zippy pace. Tech values are fine across the board thought its difficult to tell in some shots whether Stiller really is meant to look so much shorter than many co-stars. And speaking of Stiller During the final moments of ""DodgeBall"" -- after the closing credits just before the MPAA rating -- he returns in fat-man make-up for one last joke. What makes the sequence so ineffably weird is Stillers none-too-subtle hint of genuine contempt for the aud. Some viewers will be left wondering if actor is offering some kind of indirect critique of contemporary tastes in comedy.

E-mail this article Print this article Search archive Most e-mailed articles Other links Movies and showtimes Search movies Sign up for movies e-mail Several times in ""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story"" Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn) the underachieving owner of a dilapidated gym called Average Joes gives his friends a quick wink. Its so quick in fact that it almost seems like a facial tick. Did he just wink? You think he did. But youre not quite sure. I left ""Dodgeball"" in a similar state of doubt. Did that movie just wink at me? I think it did. But Im not quite sure. Heres why. The film follows one of the most hackneyed comedic story lines out there ragtag hapless misfits being bullied by villainous corporate personalities and fighting back and winning against all odds. These types of films -- the better ones starred Bill Murray -- flourished in the early 80s in a kind of ""Rocky""-meets-""Animal House"" synthesis. In the beginning of ""Dodgeball"" for example LaFleur wakes up on the couch gargles with Yoo-hoo and learns that his water and power are being turned off. Its an homage to Murray in ""Stripes"" and Vaughn has a similar kind of unaffected cushiony charm. At his gym he greets misfits both classic (the high-school nerd in love with the unattainable cheerleader) and outre (a guy who thinks hes a pirate). The bad guys are across the street in a chain called Globo Gym run by former fatty and current bully White Goodman (Ben Stiller at his over-the-top best). Of course Average Joes is delinquent on its payments and Globo Gym wants to bulldoze them under with the help of shapely banker Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor). Joes needs 50000 to survive. But how can it raise the money? Why a dodgeball tournament The finals are to be held in Las Vegas and broadcast on ESPN 8 The Ocho. The rest of the story writes itself. Clumsy beginnings. Being schooled by the grizzled veteran (Rip Torn). The possible romance. The tournament. The odds. Overcoming them But wait. The final temptation of the protagonist. His possible betrayal? Could it be? No. Because of the inspirational speech. The return of the hero. Et cetera. In a story structure this hackneyed most comedians -- Mike Myers say -- would give us at least one broad wink to let us know that he knows. First-time writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber does something more daring. He plays it straight. The in-joke -- the slight wink I thought I saw -- is in the sheer absurdity of its content. Salvation through dodgeball? Steve the Pirate? The best joke may be the cameo by the guy who delivers the inspirational speech -- whose real-life story is actually so inspirational as to be almost absurd -- and whom the protagonist just happens to run into at an airport bar. Maybe its a subtle difference Im talking about. Mike Myers and most ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni appear to be poking fun at Hollywoods lesson-learning love-conquering-all story lines when theyre actually embracing them wholeheartedly. ""Dodgeball"" appears to be embracing such a story line when its actually poking fun at it. Look for the wink.

All ... more Low-flying Dodgeball barely hits funny bone 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Dodgeball A True Underdog Story Comedy. Starring Vince Vaughn Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story"" isnt a funny movie so much as its a funny idea. Just the word ""dodgeball"" is enough to evoke the beginning of a laugh with its suggestion of grammar school frolic and playground sadism. Throw Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller into the leading roles and all the comic elements seem there except for a story and a script. And thats about where ""Dodgeball"" stays frozen in the concept phase. A story of sorts is devised -- a small-time gym owner (Vaughn) goes up against a fitness chain mogul (Ben Stiller) in order to maintain control of his business. But an underdog sports plot is an easy reach and so is most of the humor. Yes the movies watchable and there are about six good laughs in it but six good (not great) laughs in 90 minutes is pretty paltry for a comedy. A pleasant phone conversation could yield as much in 10 minutes. Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber in his feature debut ""Dodgeball"" lacks the virtues commonly found in a writer-directors first effort -- passion commitment a sense of place a feeling for a specific world. None of that is here and it makes a difference even in a comedy that aspires to silliness. The dearth of observation as well as inspiration is especially apparent in Thurbers handling of the supporting characters who are crudely drawn frantically played and desperately unfunny. The movie also fails to capitalize on the comic talent of Vaughn who is essentially cast as the straight man to a group of zanies. Hes Peter the owner of Average Joes gym a badly run business with a 50000 debt and a clientele of misfits who apparently have nothing to do but hang out in the gym -- though not one of them is in any kind of shape. Theres a shy high school kid a mentally ill man who thinks hes a pirate a deluded middle-aged fellow who doesnt know that his Internet bride is cuckolding him etc. When they find out that the dreaded White Goodman (Stiller) is about to buy out Average Joes they band together to raise the necessary 50000 by entering a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas. As the obnoxious hard-bodied fitness mogul Stiller is in his Zoolander mode scowling self-serious and almost convinced of his own devastating allure. He believes his own act because he chooses to but everything about him -- including the way he forces himself to speak in an unnaturally low voice -- is false a thin veneer over an abyss of self-loathing. Stiller makes the most of his comic opportunities including a good running joke in which hes consistently tripped up in conversation but wont acknowledge it. Hes also funny in his pursuit of a pretty lawyer (Christine Taylor) -- oblivious to her inability to suppress her gag reflex in his presence. But for all the nuance Stiller brings hes stuck in a one-note role and exhausts his welcome before the finish. Still ""Dodgeball"" has its moments. In a straight role Taylor (Stillers wife in real life) grounds the movie in whatever reality it has and shes also reliably amusing in her reactions to the other characters. Rip Torn appears as a dodgeball coach who trains his players by throwing wrenches at them. Like ""Around the World in 80 Days"" ""Dodgeball"" has several celebrity cameos and it needs them. Probably the funniest thing in the movie is a monologue by cycling superstar Lance Armstrong. -- Advisory This film contains crude sexual humor.

"Stiller Vaughn throw themselves into Dodgeball and hit the mark - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Stiller Vaughn throw themselves into Dodgeball and hit the mark By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 18 2004 Ben Stiller is like a guy on the 1919 White Sox. Hes rigged to lose. His comedy is the stuff of failure and sometimes its pleasurable watching him flit around in funny get-ups only to have a pretty costar put him down. Funnier -- or depending on the vehicle hes carrying sadder -- is when Stiller has no costume at all and is still embarrassed by someone less pretty like Larry David who gave him nothing but grief in the most recent season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm.""Stiller will do anything for a laugh even a garbagey romance such as ""Along Came Polly."" Hell do anything but win. So the outcome of his agreeable new movie ""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story"" is preordained. But in a remarkable feathered wig (with highlights) and fake goatee with chest and arms tight and tanned Stiller works very hard at telling a slapstick joke on male virility. He plays White Goodman the owner of Globo Gym a one-stop Southern California vanity super-center where you can do chin-ups or get a chin lift. White is trying his hand at Globo expansion which entails buying out the mortgage of Average Joes the sparsely attended gym across the street. (Wasnt this the plot of ""Barbershop 2""?)The owner of Joes Pete La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) can save his comparatively primitive fitness haven which looks like a rec center stuck in a shipping warehouse if he raises 50000 in a month. So Pete and his out-of-shape ragtag crew enter a dodgeball tournament the cash prize of which is exactly that amount. Just because he can and because the movie needs to give Stiller (one of the producers) more to do White enlists his own team made up of hulking personal trainers with names straight out of ""American Gladiators"" -- Laser Blade even Blazer.""Dodgeball"" is sort of a draggy bore until the game is introduced about 20 minutes in. But then the ""underdog"" of the movies dumb title kicks in and the performances from character actors such as Stephen Root Joel Moore and Missi Pyle start clicking.This is the first feature written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber who directed those ""Terry Tate"" Super Bowl spots for Reebok about the linebacker/efficiency expert from hell who plows through an office sacking slacking drones but takes a second to say ""Hi"" to a co-worker or two. Theyre some of the funniest ads Ive ever seen.""Dodgeball"" is similarly rambunctious when it finally gets to Las Vegas where the championships are held and broadcast on not-real-yet ESPN 8 -- ""the Ocho."" The movie heaps on lovely vulgar touches including a cantina named after an unspeakable sex act and the Average Joes coach Patches OHoulihan (Rip Torn) who blasts his verbal and physical assaults (""If you can dodge a car you can dodge a ball"") wearing a leather bomber jacket and zooming around in a wheelchair. The handicapped the fat the Asian are fodder for imbecilic punch lines. Everybody else in the movie is entertainingly nuts; the sexy tax attorney played by Stillers wife Christine Taylor even has a thing for unicorns.Vaughn applies his lazy-sleazy-macho stylings to the prim Taylor who appears appalled and intrigued. Vaughns approach to every part is to mumble swagger and look glazed over to make it seem as if the legendary acting career he never had is officially kaput with each new Hollywood movie. He might be the only actor whose entire approach seems based on mid-to-late-career Burt Reynolds. His genius is that he makes losing look cool where Stiller makes it look like losing.

Its a 90-minute film called Dodgeball A True Underdog Story that takes 25 minutes to establish that playing dodgeball is how the protagonist will erase his debts. Take no prisoners Vaughs character ends up in a dodgeball competition for 50000 to save his dilapidated gym. 20th Century Fox As owner of a dilapidated gym whose name reflects the movies target audience (Average Joes) Vince Vaughn is about to go belly-up and be taken over by a snazzier TV-advertised rival (Stiller). Fielding a team of male misfits and one ringer babe (Stillers wife Christine Taylor) Vaughn ends up in a Las Vegas dodgeball competition for 50000. ABOUT THE MOVIE Dodgeball   1/2 (out of four) Stars Ben Stiller Vince Vaughn Christine Taylor Rip Torn Justin Long. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for rude and sexual humor and language Opens Friday nationwide Thats about it unless you count cameos (a couple of them funny) by cyclist Lance Armstrong William Shatner and Chuck Norris who adds to his already distinguished filmography. The team endures toughen-up rituals from a dodgeball legend played by Rip Torn who with his gray shoulder-length hair looks like Rip Torn after 5000 acid trips. Coach Torn adds to a palpably violent undertone by heaving wrenches at their heads and crotches making The Three Stooges poking and slapping look downright tame. Its tough to imagine Gary Cole (so funny in The Brady Bunch Movie and Office Space) one day telling his grandchildren ""I once played the announcer in Dodgeball."" Yet consumer reviews on the Internet Movie Database indicate that a sizable number of apparent couch dweebs loved 1998s BASEketball to which Dodgeball is heir apparent.

"Dodgeball | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dodgeball ) Dodgeball (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Of course Dodgeball isnt a true underdog anything but thats all part of the joke. A blistering satire of feel-good sports movies this film makes its mark via the most direct route it lampoons by adopting the tried-and-true ""straight"" formula and tweaking it a little. The approach works because many sports dramas are borderline unintentional parodies with less tension than a flaccid cable; all the filmmakers of Dodgeball had to do was to follow the plot-by-numbers approach incorporate some obviously comedic material and toss in a huge dose of over-the-top earnestness. The resulting product offers about 90 minutes of laughter (although the movie runs out of steam during its final third). Most of us remember dodge ball - the scourge of gym students around the country. A ""sport"" designed by sadists to allow the strong to prey upon the weak its the nightmare of every kid with more brains than brawn. Recently dodgeball has been banned in some schools on the grounds that its too dangerous and breeds aggression. So what could represent a more ludicrous event for a feel-good sports underdog movie? And thats the point. Besides nearly every other sport has been taken. The showdown that Dodgeball builds to is the ultimate David/Goliath battle with the ""Average Joes Gym"" team facing the ""Globo Gym"" pros. And its all being televised on ESPN 8 (""The Ocho""). On the one side we have straight-shooting Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) whos competing to get the 50000 that will keep the bank from foreclosing on his gym. He is joined by five of his clients an attractive ex-bank employee (Christine Taylor) and legendary dodgeball player-turned-coach Patches OHoulihan (Rip Torn). On the other side is a group of mean monsters assembled by Globo tycoon White Goodman (Ben Stiller) who wants to acquire Average Joes so he can tear it down and erect a parking garage. No points for guessing who wins who gets kissed or whose luck runs out. Although Dodgeball is built on a foundation of satire theres plenty of conventional humor varying from the not-too-silly to the absolutely ridiculous. Some of the one-off gags such as White pumping himself up in preparation for an encounter with a woman are hilarious. Others lose their effect through repetition - seeing someone get nailed by a volley of hard-thrown balls is only funny the first time or two. In fact Whites character is an example how overexposure dulls the edge of comedy. This sleazy Fonzie is amusing for a while but after about an hour he becomes a bore. Theres something to be said for limiting the screen time of a cartoon villain. Once again Vince Vaughn proves unable to hold his own in talented company even though his role simply requires that he play the straight guy. Hes straight all right - and stiff as a board. More energetic but still looking like Marcia Brady a decade after The Brady Bunch Movie is Christine Taylor who is given the opportunity to beat the crap out of her husband in the line of duty (she is Mrs. Ben Stiller). There are a few noteworthy cameos including Hank Azaria William Shatner and a guy (identity kept secret to preserve the punch-line) who proves that he is capable of having fun at his own expense. Few satires are capable of sustaining their comedic momentum for the length of a full feature film and Dodgeball is no exception. The film starts out slowly hits its stride fifteen minutes in then starts flagging around the two-thirds point. By the time Dodgeball reaches its obligatory conclusion all of the potential for humor has been burned up. Of course comedy is subjective and there are those who will be less-than-enamored with Dodgeballs sophomoric and occasionally vulgar brand of humor. For me however it was a pleasant diversion in the midst of a movie season that has been to this point a disappointment.
