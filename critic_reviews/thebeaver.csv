Mel Gibsons Domestic-Violence Charges Dropped By Ex Its a bummer of a movie -- dark and at cross-purposes with both itself and any image do-over you might be seeking Sorry Mel. ""The Beaver"" is not going to rehabilitate you. Its a bummer of a movie -- dark and at cross-purposes with both itself and any image do-over you might be seeking. In many ways a movie stars public persona an acting job - just as much as the roles he or she plays on screen. But in an era of TMZ and citizen paparazzi it has become ever more difficult to maintain any kind of false facade. For the decades Gibson was riding high he had a reputation as an Australian archetype -- the ""larrikin."" Its a word used Down Under to describe -- usually with fond frustration -- a boisterous young man prone to mischief. We all have watched Gibsons behavior go from maverick to maniac. There was nothing likable about his DUI arrest anti-Semitic rant or addressing a female police officer as ""Sugar Tits"" back in 2006. Those indiscretions paled though next to the allegations last year that he had beat up and threatened with a gun his then girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva the mother of his infant daughter. When audio recordings of him screaming in rage at her using shockingly racist and misogynistic language surfaced last summer it seemed his as a movie star was kaput and beyond salvaging no matter how many contrite interviews he might be willing to give. Ironically at the time he had already completed filming on ""The Beaver"" a movie about a middle-aged man in the throes of a breakdown. Awkward. The movies opening was pushed back until now with the hope that there would be enough other more recent celebrity flameouts -- Charlie Sheen going ballistic Chris Brown trashing his dressing room at ""Good Morning America"" Lindsey Lohan pouting in court yet again etc. -- that Mels misdeeds would have become a distant memory. Not a chance thats gonna happen. Nope. Not even with Wednesdays news that Oksana has dropped her domestic-violence charges. ""The Beaver"" first came to notice when writer Kyle Killens screenplay topped the 2008s infamous Black List of Hollywoods best unproduced scripts. Jodie Foster signed on as director and star and cast Gibson -- with whom she had been friendly since they co-starred in 1964s ""Maverick"" -- in the leading role. A seemingly comic drama ""Beaver"" tells the story of a middle-aged toy company executive who deep in the throes of depression discovers that the only way he can communicate is by ranting via a hand puppet -- a beaver perched on his left arm. This furry alter-ego oozes brash self-confidence and speaks in a voice and accent that sound alarmingly like Michael Caines. The problem is that ""Beaver"" is really three movies in one all at odds with each other. The first is an angry absurdist take on a middle-aged guy letting it all hang out with his puppet turning into a cross between Svengali and Chucky. The second is a bleak would-be realistic look at how the depression of one family member affects all family members and how tough it can be to treat. And the third is a warm fuzzy were-all-in-this-recovery-together flick. As a director Foster (who also plays the wife of Gibsons character) never manages to get the three to mesh and the movies tone keeps wavering. There is also a glaring problem with the films timeline. The secondary plot revolves around a troubled teenage son (Anton Yelchin giving another excellent performance) who is ghost writing a graduation speech for a classmate (Jennifer Lawrence). The son is either the slowest speechwriter ever or all of the other events of the movie including the conception manufacturing and introduction of a major toy line and a characters recovery from a severe medical injury unrealistically occur within a couple months at most. Gibson looking every one of his 55 years and more is utterly believable as a man weary of living and ready to say the hell with it all. Its an entirely convincing performance -- with viewers bound to ask themselves how much is acting -- for the initial dark portions of the movie. Its near the end as his character perks up and the movie becomes a gooey family drama that both Gibson and ""Beaver"" go soft. So how do you want your Mel? Mean or likeable? Im guessing most moviegoers at this point dont want him at all. ""The Beaver"" isnt going to change that. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Were only minutes into the film when Gibsons depressed and suicidal Walter Black permanently attaches a furry beaver to his hand and starts awkwardly to claw back his doomed relationship with his wife (Foster) and two sons Porter (Anton Yelchin) whos about to finish high school and Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) whos a fair bit younger and the only family member fully tolerant of Walters bizarre behaviour. Walter and the beaver take showers together jog together and make love to his wife together. Most importantly Walter only speaks through the beaver and the puppet is even there when Walter goes on Americas Today programme to talk about the success of a new range of DIY beaver kits hes selling via his ailing toy company. To voice the beaver Gibson adopts a dreadful cor-blimey British accent with hints of Aussie he sounds like Michael Caine after a long break in Sydney. Meanwhile in a parallel story strand Walters resentful son Porter who sells essays to fellow students is developing an on-off friendship with Norah (Jennifer Lawrence) a classmate who masks her own problems behind beauty and success. There are funny moments when the beaver is first introduced and Walter tries to pass it off as a legitimate form of therapy (Its very big in Sweden). But the film soon becomes tiresome and laboured. Neither Foster nor screenwriter Kyle Killen can resolve the gulf between the seriousness of depression and family breakdown and the ridiculousness of Walters adoption of his furry proxy. Instead Foster just moves clumsily between two tones comic and serious without finding a satisfactory meeting of the two. Foster herself is sidelined and underused as Walters wife and the secondary plot involving Walters son comes across more like a distracting red herring than a successful secondary illustration of the films wishy-washy themes of honesty open expression and harmony. Rather than inspiring anything more biting comic or clever Gibsons upstaging co-star the puppet ends up being a catalyst for sentimental family reconstruction and big hugs all round. Beyond the initial idea this is kid gloves filmmaking when what we need is a bit more of the gloves-off stuff.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""THE BEAVER."" | Family dramedy PG-13. 1 hour 31 minutes. At the Mayan. Its been a spell since Jodie Foster has directed a film -- 16 years to be exact. And when she finally found a script that captured her imagination the very public explosion last year by Mel Gibson meant audiences had to wait a bit longer for her third feature to open. ""The Beaver"" turns out to be worth the wait. The film is amusing then melancholy then weirdly funny then not. Its a quiet measured work -- an odd thing to say given how effusive Walter Black becomes once he begins using a furry brown hand puppet as his only way of communicating. Gibson shares the screen with a sharp ensemble. Foster and up-and- comers Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence add to the hurt and hope in this askew drama about depression. The family man and toy-company exec has been booted out of the house because he cannot overcome his emotional stupor. Profoundly down in the dumps Walter finds his therapy in a Dumpster. He returns home with ""a prescription"" hand puppet. The films most original pleasure comes thanks to Gibsons dedication to the films absurd premise. He doesnt resort to ventriloquism and still the puppet commands the screen. The Beaver nearly hijacks the show. Seven-year-old Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) takes to the new member of the family seamlessly. Their connection is why Meredith (Foster) yields. The only one whos not having it is oldest son Porter (Yelchin). A writer Porter pens papers for his fellow students for money. Norah (Lawrence) a brainy cheerleader with sorrows of her own seeks out his skills for her valedictory speech. Shes easy to fall for and Porter does. Foster a determined performer seems more relaxed letting Merediths dismay as an exhausted mate and protective mother fill her gaze. The puppet also allows the toy- company exec to make peace with his alienated employees. You get the sense from faces at the office -- even that of the deserving VP played by Cherry Jones -- that theyll indulge the Beaver because although he speaks in a rather charming cockney accent with a bare-knuckled confidence hes still attached to the boss hand. The emperor has new clothes? Yup. The Beaver even inspires Walter to undertake the sort of scheme that sends the film in the direction of a triumphal comeback tale. Then the movie taps the brakes. For all its quirkiness ""The Beaver"" takes its characters psychic wounds seriously. Its good to have some distance between the on-screen Gibson and the frothing Gibson who resorted too easily to misogynist racist and anti- Semitic slurs. This idiosyncratic film -- written with wit and kindness by newcomer Kyle Killen -- serves as a reminder of why he mattered. Gibson gives a performance full of anguish and slivers of promise. For a time the puppet frees Walter to explain himself to the people whom hes failed. Perhaps ""The Beaver"" will allow Gibson to reconnect with audiences that will have him.

"Northwest Herald | Movie review The Beaver LOCAL NEWS AND VIDEO FOR MCHENRY COUNTY ILJuly 30 2016 Mostly Cloudy 76degFOpen Menu Local News State News Business Nation amp; World Sports Photos and Lists Entertainment Weather Video Obituaries Classified Jobs HubArkush.com Planit Northwest Prep Sports Contact Us Movie review The BeaverBy DAVID GERMAIN - The Associated PressMel Gibsons interpersonal flaws have all but ruined his career. Now with the dark comic drama ""The Beaver"" Gibson delivers a career performance that salvages a flawed film. Directed by longtime pal Jodie Foster who also co-stars ""The Beaver"" was shot in between Gibsons 2006 anti-Semitic rant during a drunken-driving arrest and his ugly breakup from ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva which resulted in his no-contest plea and three years on probation after he was accused of striking her last year. Inevitably because of the spectacle of Gibsons private life it will be difficult for viewers to separate the real person from the fictional character in this tale of a suicidal man struggling with depression and inner demons. ""The Beaver"" is an unorthodox therapy session for Gibsons Walter Black a family man at the end of his rope who has a psychiatric break after finding a beaver hand puppet a piece of cloth and fur that becomes an alter-ego helping him to work through his problems at least initially. As Walter and his beaver buddy delve deeper into the nature of depression viewers likely will ponder whether Gibson was exploring his own dark emotional recesses at the same time. Maybe maybe not. Either way Gibson creates a rich engrossing portrait of a man in deep distress playing Walter with great heart and humor where appropriate and the rest of the time with the disturbing conviction of someone whos been there himself. Gibsons performance makes the film generally work despite a story from first-time screenwriter Kyle Killen that veers from an absorbing family dynamic into a pointless media circus as Walter and his beaver puppet become national celebrities. ""The Beaver"" would have been more effective without the tabloid trappings if the story had been contained within the narrower and relatable confines of the Black family which has been torn apart by Walters depression. So much so that as the film opens his wife Meredith (Foster) is kicking him out of the house for the good of their two sons angry 17-year-old Porter (Anton Yelchin) and 7-year-old Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart). The head of a toy manufacturer he inherited from his uncle Walter has been in the dumps so long that his household and his business are ready to crumble. At a low-point when taking his life seems the only option Walter stumbles on the beaver puppet through which he begins to speak in a Cockney accent demanding that others interact with the creature as his proxy. The beaver speaks like a no-nonsense working-class shrink lifting Walter out of his funk winning over Meredith and Henry who are glad to have husband and father back in any form and reviving the fortunes of the toy company. Porter clearly dealing with symptoms of potential depression inherited from his father is the only one who doesnt buy into the beaver viewing the puppet as a crass ploy for his dad to weasel his way back into the family. Early on Gibson yucks it up with charm and vigor as if the beaver were just that and the film were a lightweight comic fantasy about mental illness. ""The Beaver"" gradually digs much much deeper as the beaver persona proves to be another symptom of the dark spaces in which Walter has lived much of his life. It still winds up a mental-illness fantasy with a forced ending and a convenient side story involving Porters valedictorian classmate (Jennifer Lawrence) thats there to provide a broader view of family dysfunction. As in her previous times behind the camera on ""Little Man Tate"" and ""Home for the Holidays"" Foster provides a precise measured setting for the story then steps back and lets her actors perform. Friends with Gibson since they co-starred in 1994s ""Maverick"" Foster is a sturdy but muted presence alongside Gibson whose eyes bespeak a bottomless melancholy even as he works the puppet on his hand with a glib voice and maniacal movements. Gibson makes the puppet feel like part of his own body and a frightening extension of Walters subconscious. With the dusky corners Gibson has revealed of his own psyche ""The Beaver"" is not only a showcase for a great performance but also an intriguing academic study of where Walter ends and Gibson begins. No matter what he does what acts of contrition Gibson undertakes his career will never be the same. Some perhaps many in Hollywood will not want to work with him but as long as friends like Foster stand by the guy Gibson can find interesting work. In smaller films than he once starred in granted but that happens to virtually all aging actors. With ""The Beaver"" Gibson shows that for all his personal turmoil he still may have a career in the twilight years. ""The Beaver"" Three stars Rated PG-13 for mature thematic material some disturbing content sexuality and language including a drug reference.

"Mel Gibsons troubled eyes tell the Beaver story - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Mel Gibsons troubled eyes tell the Beaver story By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Mel Gibson yearns to be understood and in The Beaver he shows the strain. By Ken Regan Summit Entertainment The beaver hand puppet is a savior for Walter (Mel Gibson) a man battling behavioral demons. EnlargeClose By Ken Regan Summit Entertainment The beaver hand puppet is a savior for Walter (Mel Gibson) a man battling behavioral demons. Yet for the role of a profoundly depressed husband and father his lined visage and troubled eyes work perfectly. In real life Gibson has attributed his much publicized aggressive behavior to alcoholism and depression and his character Walter struggles with the same demons. Of course his casting was hardly accidental The director is pal Jodie Foster. Though this is fiction its easy to let what we know of reality bleed into our interpretation of the story. VIDEO See the trailer The title refers to a hand puppet that Walter manipulates and speaks through so he can cope with his deep melancholy. Though the notion has its outlandishly comic aspect the movie is more painfully sad than humorous. Walter hits rock bottom after his wife Meredith (Foster) walks out with their two sons. Filled with suicidal impulses and reeling boozily he stumbles around his apartment and rescues a ratty-looking beaver hand puppet from the garbage. His savior is born as the beaver commits himself to lifting Walter out of his black hole. As uneven as the film is it might be Gibsons finest performance. We buy his tortured persona but its harder to accept how he quickly transforms from suicidal to jovial. About the movie The Beaver   1/2 out of fourStars Mel Gibson Jodie Foster Anton Yelchin Jennifer Lawrence Director Jodie Foster Distributor Summit Entertainment Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material some disturbing content sexuality and language including a drug reference Running time 1 hour 30 minutes Expands Friday nationwide Foster brings a stately directorial style but the material sometimes feels too flimsy to merit it. That near-glacial pacing makes it harder still to effectively mine the humor in this grim tale which also involves the suffering of Meredith and the rage felt by son Porter ( Anton Yelchin). Some of Gibsons best scenes involve reconnecting with his younger son (Riley Thomas Stewart) for whom the puppet suddenly makes his dad lovable in a way he had never been. But the story lacks honesty. For a film about the real problem of mental illness it never feels authentic. Depression is not something neatly tied up. If this is meant as an allegory its vague and unconvincing. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint If anyone can see past the suggestive title the oddball premise and the controversial casting of this film they might be surprised to find it surprisingly tolerable. Think what you may of Mel Gibson offscreen he is an actor of great power and finesse and here he delivers a searing performance as Walter Black a clinically depressed toy company executive. On the verge of suicide Walter discovers a mangy buck-toothed beaver puppet in a liquor store dumpster and uses it to communicate with his family and colleagues. Speaking through the puppet with a Cockney growl Walter is able to express feelings about his pain his self-esteem and his sanity that are too painful to confront otherwise. Jodie Foster who co-stars as Walters anxious wife directs the film in an unadorned earnest manner. The look and rhythms of the piece suggest ""The Beaver"" will be a sentimental psychoanalytic homily but her tale is darker stranger funnier and more complicated than the setup suggests. ""The Beaver"" is a story of an entire family in crisis. Even before Walters breakdown his son (Anton Yelchin) a high school senior turned away from him filling a bedroom wall with Post-It notes of his fathers traits that he wants to avoid. Walters wife masks her nervous tension beneath a chipper veneer insisting that Walter can snap out of his depression if he just gets a grip on himself. In a harrowing anniversary dinner scene Foster pleads for things to return to the way they used to be. ""Dont you understand?"" the Beaver replies. ""That man is dead."" Throughout the film Walters spokes-puppet becomes a distinct personality with drives of its own telling jokes making bold business decisions and verbally challenging Walter. As his toy business gains media attention for launching a craze Walter enters the national spotlight as the kook of the week. Ken Regan/summit Entertainment Star Tribune Riley Thomas Stewart and Mel Gibson in ""The Beaver"" He doesnt humiliate himself however. The Beaver acquits itself well speaking eloquently in broadcast interviews and becoming Walters dominant alter ego. In time it becomes a kind of parasite demanding a disturbing degree of control over its host. In its last minutes the film goes very dark with serious threats to the survival of the Black family and to Walters life. Gibson plays madmen wonderfully. He gave a loopy satirical edge to the loose-cannon-cop stock character in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies and in ""Conspiracy Theory"" he played a genuine paranoid who uncovered an unbelievable government mind-control plot. Here hes playing Walter for real. His confessional outpourings have an unsettling resonance with Gibsons real life. The part appears to tap into the actors own demons. The nuttiest role of Gibsons life has inspired the best performance of his career.

The Beaver Fair to good Director Jodie Foster. Cast Mel Gibson Jodie Foster Anton Yelchin. Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material some disturbing content sexuality and language including a drug reference. Note At Harkins Camelview. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Mel Gibson Wonder if itll matter? An actors personal life usually is irrelevant to his performance; the nicest guy in the world might be terrible on-screen and thus have failed. Were not lining up potential neighbors here were watching movies. But Gibsons highly publicized personal conduct - he recently pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery against his ex-girlfriend eight months after his seemingly insane telephone rants went viral - could be such a turnoff that audiences stay away from ""The Beaver."" INTERVIEW Foster on Gibson backlash Understandable maybe but also a shame. Gibsons performance as Walter Black ranks among the best of his career. Walter we learn as the film opens is hopelessly depressed. Floating in the backyard pool lying in bed staring aimlessly ahead in meetings at the toy company he owns hes basically uncommunicative and despondent. His young son Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) is struggling at school while older son Porter (Anton Yelchin) writes the traits he shares with his father on Post-it notes cataloging them so he can eliminate them. Eventually its too much for Walters wife Meredith (Foster) to take so she kicks him out of the house. Drunk Walter finds a beaver puppet in a dumpster. Back in his hotel room he tries to hang himself but botches it then starts to leap off a balcony literally teetering on the brink when hes interrupted by a thick Cockney accent. Its the puppet on his arm and he talks Walter down. Of course its really Walter talking Walter down but at least hes talking communicating even in this bizarre manner. The next thing you know Walter is at home playing with Henry whos delighted. He hands Meredith a card explaining that the Beaver as the puppet wants to be called is a ""prescription puppet."" All communication will be through the Beaver; Walter will not speak. (Its not ventriloquism; Walter doesnt even try to not move his lips.) Meredith is suspicious but delighted that her husband is interacting in any form. Only Porter isnt on board - he thinks the puppet business is nuts and he has a point. But Porter has his own problems. Hes headed for the Ivy League but has a little business on the side writing term papers for other students. His newest client is Norah (Jennifer Lawrence) the school valedictorian who is not without struggles herself. Porter is intrigued (and clearly smitten) but also awkward. His time with Norah takes up almost as much of the movie as Walters story. Meanwhile Walter - or the Beaver - has come up with a new toy idea that becomes a huge hit landing him puppet on hand on such shows as ""The Daily Show"" and ""Today"" as well as on the cover of magazines devoted to news business and mental health. Walter makes no attempt to hide the Beaver and continues to communicate through him. Only once on their anniversary dinner when Meredith insists does Walter leave the Beaver behind with disastrous results. Clearly the Beaver has taken over Walters life - one would think that when he wears the puppet while having sex with Meredith would be a clue for her - and gradually everyone even Walter realizes it. Their separation will be a painful one. There are problems aplenty here. Walters transformation from near-catatonic to (sort of) happy family man is too quick too complete as is his realization that the Beaver has become a menace (the Beavers transformation is abrupt as well). Although Porters story is intriguing (and Yelchin quite good as is Lawrence) it competes with Walters at times distracting us from it. And Fosters direction drifts too often between deadly serious and almost silly never quite striking the appropriate balance (perhaps because there isnt one). But Gibsons performance at times subtle at times showy and never less than remarkable is what makes ""The Beaver"" worth seeing for those still willing to do so.

(AP Photo/Summit Entertainment Ken Regan) Ken Regan In this film publicity image released by Summit Entertainment Riley Thomas Stewart left and Mel Gibson are shown in a scene from ""The Beaver."" (AP Photo/Summit Entertainment Ken Regan) Walter Black (Mel Gibson) is deeply depressed -- so much so that his wife Meredith (Jodie Foster) has thrown him out of their house. Things look so bad for Walter that he contemplates suicide. But a friend implores him to give life another try.Who is this friend? An old college buddy? A stranger who takes pity on a man who clearly needs a shoulder to cry on? Not even close. Its a hand puppet in the shape of a beaver who speaks in a Cockney accent and is more demanding than a drill sergeant.The odd thing is the puppet offers excellent advice -- helping Walter turn his failing company around and getting him back on Merediths good side. But the beaver cant handle everything. Walters alienated son Porter (Anton Yelchin) has no use for his fathers delusional behavior but is definitely interested in getting closer to his high school classmate Norah (Jennifer Lawrence).Although ""The Beaver"" has its funny moments its not a comedy. Working from a screenplay by Kyle Killen Foster -- who also directed -- delivers a poignant family drama while eliciting one of Gibsons best performances. As a director shes come a long way since ""Little Man Tate"" (1991) and her latest effort bodes well for her career behind the camera.The presence of Gibson whos had plenty of bad publicity in recent years may prevent some people from seeing the film. But his baggage only makes it easier for us to identify with Walters spiritual woes. Gibson really throws himself into the part bringing an intense scariness to his conversations with the puppet. Unfortunately the film spends way too much time on Porter and Norah whose storyline comes across as relatively trivial.""The Beaver"" isnt a perfect film but its challenging and original.

Depression isnt the half of whats eating him. More about The Beaver >> When first we meet the suicidal toy entrepreneur played by Mel Gibson in The Beaver he literally and figuratively is adrift on an inflatable thats the opposite of a life raft. His arms are outstretched as if nailed to an invisible cross. Summit Entertainment Jodie Foster Mel Gibson and The Beaver the tireless title character who speaks in a Cockney accident. Directed by and costarring Jodie Foster The Beaver chronicles soul-dead Walter and his resurrection by means of a beaver hand puppet. The puppet enables him to express emotions he cannot as husband father and employer. That this ambitious if deeply odd film is so compulsively watchable is a credit to Gibsons compelling performances both as spiritless Walter and the Cockney-accented voice of the tireless title character. But who is in charge the puppet barking orders or Walter speaking for it and manipulating its mouth? Whichever with the puppet Walter comes back from the brink and is a husband and father again even if he does bring The Beaver into the marital bed. It would be enough to play the listless entrepreneur or to supply the voice for the chipper puppet. Yet there is Gibson doing both simultaneously a creepy and compelling case study of dissociative identity disorder. If Walters split personality treads perilously close to Gibsons tarnished image as a tormented guy struggling with alcoholism and self-control so be it. The movie doesnt belabor the point. It has other points to belabor. Namely dividing its characters into id-ridden ego-driven and superego-ruled. And suggesting that career is symbolic of character. Walters wife Meredith (Foster in an enervated performance) is a designer of roller coasters which given Walters highs and lows must mean shes on the Cyclone both at home and at work. Veering from family tragedy to absurdist comedy to possessed-by-demons thriller Kyle Killens script has at least one mood shift too many. Mostly though it focuses on the sadness of those who express themselves only by proxy. Walter is a ventriloquist for The Beaver; Walters son Porter (the excellent Anton Yelchin) is a ventriloquist for fellow classmates who hire him to write term papers in their voices. One of his clients is Norah (lovely Jennifer Lawrence) who has her own reasons for being emotionally blocked. When its gifted actors arent hamstrung by the literalism of Killens screenplay The Beaver is bizarrely liberating. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

This Is A Joke Right? Credit Summit Entertainment An Amazing Mess An Amazing Mess Credit Summit Entertainment In The Beaver a stately family drama with a black comedy struggling to break free from within Mel Gibson deploys a seemingly magical hand puppet -- plus more charm than hes allowed out in public in years. Gibson plays Walter Black a toy-company executive (hold that thought) whose professional and family life have gone exponentially south as his long-festering depression hits rock bottom. Filled with booze and suicidal ideation Walter rescues a slightly sinister-looking beaver puppet from a dumpster and before you can say therapeutic transference the puppet -- voiced by Gibson in an impressive Cockney circa early Michael Caine -- gets busy galvanizing Walter out of his funk. Soon the pair are inseparable with the beaver orchestrating Walters public and private rehabilitation quite literally at arms length. Business booms; domestic life recharges on all cylinders including the post-coital wow. Only Walters sullen teenaged son (Anton Yelchin) remains unpersuaded by his fathers regained pizzazz. Yelchins Porter is determined to annihilate any unhelpful traits he might have inherited from Dad but try as he might hes as glum as Walter ever was -- this despite the attentions of a troubled yet gutsy valedictorian played by Jennifer Lawrence whose sweet face and shapely form are bracingly belied by a raspy alto bark and a steely resolve that may remind you a bit of the young Jodie Foster. And aptly so Foster directs the movie and plays Walters hitherto forgiving wife Meredith who finally puts her foot down and tells Walter its time to drop the crutch toy and grow up. Needless to say the Buck-Toothed One is not amused and here the movie takes a sudden swerve to the dark side in ways I cant divulge without bringing on packs of baying spoiler-alert hounds. Suffice it to say that Walters bossy mentor -- a big hit with Matt Lauer Jon Stewart and NPRs own Terry Gross all doing adorably hammy versions of themselves -- can morph on a dime into Moammar Gadhafi. With help from his new alter ego Walter charms his way back into the good graces of his youngest son (Riley Thomas Stewart). Ken Regan/Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Ken Regan/Summit Entertainment This ought to be a lot more unnerving than it is. Foster makes as plain and professional a director as she is an actor; her sense of pacing can be downright leaden. Yet she knows when to lay off and let Gibson set the tone and she gives her old buddy -- whom shes staunchly defended throughout the real-life travails hes brought on himself -- free rein to play off the two personas that have brought him fame and notoriety. Those who love the rumpled charisma and self-deprecating ease with which Gibson pepped up even slight romantic comedies like What Women Want (2000) will be charmed by the The Beavers first act. Those who groove to the punitive self-mutilation fantasies that have pumped up his self-directed work (from Braveheart through The Passion of the Christ to Apocalypto) will not be disappointed by the visceral ordeal that lays Walter low then resurrects him. Screenwriter Kyle Killen wrote the capable script for The Beaver while his wife was pregnant with twins and he clearly had more than one kind of splitting on his mind. Walter Black may be at war with himself but The Beaver is at its core a classically Oedipal tale. While one son angles in all the wrong ways for his abject fathers attention another engages in a heroic struggle with his abusive bully of a dad. Gibson sounds too few notes for true versatility but as a man and an actor he surely qualifies as one of the most rivetingly schizoid figures in American cinema today. Watching Walter switch from destroyer to destroyed and back again is a pathologically authentic experience. Being the creature that it is of course The Beaver has no choice but to mellow him out and integrate his warring parts. I didnt buy it for a second.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 6 2011 Save for later Saved Jodie Foster directed and co-stars with Mel Gibson in The Beaver. The script was named best unproduced screenplay by Hollywood Blacklist in 2008 which our reviewer notes goes to prove that not all Hollywood blacklists are bad. Summit Entertainment          View Caption About video ads View Caption of When I first heard about the premise for Jodie Fosters ""The Beaver"" which stars Mel Gibson I thought to myself ""Are they kidding?"" Its about Walter Black a severely depressed chief executive officer of a failing childrens toy company who rouses himself back to sanity by creating a loudmouthed Cockney-accented alter ego for himself in the form of a beaver hand puppet that he fishes out of a dumpster.Well nobodys kidding - which doesnt mean that ""The Beaver"" isnt often inadvertently risible. Its script by Kyle Killen created a stir in 2008 when it was named as the best unproduced screenplay by an outfit called Hollywood Blacklist which I guess goes to prove that not all Hollywood blacklists are bad.It doesnt help of course that Gibson brings with him more baggage than an ocean liner or that some of that baggage seems to have been consciously worked into the movie. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Walter for example in a pre-beaver effort to shock himself out of his depression is briefly shown flagellating himself like a Roman Catholic penitent. Turned out of his house by his loving but exasperated wife Meredith (Foster) he groggily haunts liquor stores and boozed up prepares to jump from the balcony of his crummy hotel room. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Actually Walters searing masochism here doesnt represent anything new for Gibson. As an actor hes specialized in roles (the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies ""The Man Without a Face"" ""Braveheart"" ""Conspiracy Theory"" to name just a few) in which his characters are maimed tortured self-annihilating. But given his serial public outrages in recent years its impossible if not altogether fair not to see ""The Beaver"" as a species of psychodrama.Still Gibson has long demonstrated a dynamic gift for combining seriousness and levity qualities that should have stood him in good stead here. But the entire film is overlaid with a sodden earnestness that of course makes everything seem all the sillier. Gibson doesnt disgrace himself but he never breaks free of the films pervasive sogginess either. Foster probably figured that any humor would risk turning his performance into nutball vaudeville. At least that would have been entertaining.Foster seems blinkered and tone-deaf to whats actually appearing onscreen. When for example Walter is reunited with his family - which includes his unconditionally adoring young son Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) and the unforgiving 17-year-old Porter (the adept Anton Yelchin) - theres a quick sex scene where we see Walter Meredith and yes the beaver frolicking together in bed. He addresses his toy-store workers as he does everybody else almost entirely through the hand puppet and there are precious few reaction shots of them looking anything more than agreeably amused.When Walter turns the company around and ends up on the cover of national magazines and puppet in hand appears on ""The Today Show"" Fosters fable enters the realm of blithering unbelievability.""The Beaver"" never even makes it clear if Walter knows his puppet is just a puppet. He passes out cards to people explaining that he is utilizing a ""prescription puppet"" but that could just be the beaver talking. When the puppet becomes increasingly uppity and malevolent I guess were supposed to think that Walter is healing himself by separating himself from his alter ego and becoming whole again. But we never get a sense of what Walter was like before his personality fractured so his impending wholeness doesnt have much heft.The story line involving Porter is comparatively conventional which under the circumstances is something of a relief. Even before the beaver shows up Porter already hates his father so much that he papers his room with Post-its notating all of Walters many traits he wants expunged from himself. Hes the sole person who barks at Walter about how crazy he seems. Only when Porter becomes involved with a brainy cheerleader (a fine Jennifer Lawrence) with her own pack of troubles does he begin to register the compassion necessary to reunite with his father.Or at least thats what were supposed to believe. Ive rarely seen a movie about severe malcontents that ended on such a note of unearned uplift. Who knows? Maybe it would have all turned out better if the beaver had been a bunny rabbit.

Mel Gibson a celebrity spectacle now infamous for profane tirades and racial slurs plays a man who loses his mind and communicates with the outside world through a cuddly beaver puppet. The jokes practically write themselves.With the morbid fascination comes a solid little drama about mental illness and unlikely paths to redemption. Gibsons real-life flameout is a big part of the equation When we watch a movie star on-screen we see all of the baggage that star brings to the role. You dont have to like Gibson to appreciate the built-in drama of a mad man playing a madman.When we meet Gibsons Walter Black hes circling the drain immobilized by depression and running his toy company into the ground through apathy. His teenage son (Anton Yelchin of Star Trek) keeps a running tally of traits he hopes not to inherit. His wife (Jodie Foster who also directed) has just about had it. On the brink of suicide Walter stumbles upon the scrawny fuzzy puppet slides his hand in and begins talking like Michael Caine. Its not Clarence the guardian angel from Its a Wonderful Life but itll have to do.In all seriousness Gibson has a pretty tough job here. Walters new friend is a bit of a taskmaster a tough-love third party and a sort of character in its own right. The beaver is Walters life support and when hes shoved to the side as in an anniversary dinner that goes awry its back to square one. No beaver no Walter. Things do get a little awkward in bed as you might imagine.The parallel story line involving Walters son Porter dovetails nicely. A caustic brooder convinced that his old man is simply a loser Porter makes cash by writing papers for his fellow students -- an act of ventriloquism that dad might understand. Porter finds an unlikely ally in Norah the class valedictorian played by Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence (Winters Bone). A budding artist stifled by conformity and her own grief shes one more character looking for a way out of her personal traps.You cant help but see The Beaver as some sort of therapy for a disgraced star. His eyes hollowed out a look of inevitable doom written across his face Gibson is every bit the lost soul here. You can decide if the man deserves any forgiveness but his off-screen behavior and on-screen despair make for fascinating alchemy.The BeaverB+ Starring Mel Gibson Jodie Foster Anton Yelchin Jennifer Lawrence and Cherry Jones.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 06 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The diagnosis delivered in a clinical voice-over comes right in the opening frame ""Walter Black is a highly depressed individual."" Once in possession of a successful career plus a solid marriage he has hit the bottle hard and slid deeply into the slough of despond. Since Walter Black is played by Mel Gibson whose own career has been torpedoed by off-camera behaviour that he has attributed to the same twin demons of booze and depression the typecasting is hard to miss. Movies The Beaver The official trailer Notable too is the director Jodie Foster a long-time friend of Gibson even through his travails and the one responsible for giving him this particular role. Inevitably all this background seeps into the text of the film so that at times its as if were watching two movies at once here - one is transparent the other is speculative both are often bizarre and ultimately disappointing. For the moment lets confine matters to the picture on the screen - a psychological drama so in love with its own imagination that it leaves nothing to ours. The result is a weird sort of literalism beginning with the title conceit. Abandoned by his long-suffering spouse Meredith (Foster) living in a claustrophobic hotel room and poised on the very brink of suicide Walter is saved by a hand-puppet - yes the Beaver - that he happens to find in a dumpster. Draped over his left arm the stuffed thing becomes his alter ego which for reasons best known to him he gives voice to in a crude Cockney accent pitched somewhere between Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins. Instantly his depressed self vanishes and a better fate emerges - in short Wally leaves it to Beaver. I wish I were joking. Clearly the screenplay is looking for some black comedy here but Fosters direction is too earnest to locate it. Instead she quickly moves on to the warm reception given to the new and improved Walter amp; Co. Introduced with a calling card that reads ""Prescription Puppet"" the Beaver proves surprisingly adept at winning over skeptics. In the office co-workers are impressed with his amiability and confidence. Back at home youngest son Henry is delighted with his dummy Daddy and Meredith too cant help but be thrilled with his regained vigour especially in the bedroom. There she enjoys the puppets staying power; elsewhere though that same staying power - Walter even showers with it - has her worried. Seems Wally cant imagine life without the Beav. The only holdout is the teenage son Porter (Anton Yelchin) who continues to despise his father and fear any inherited resemblance. Nevertheless he is also in the voice-appropriation business For a handsome fee Porter writes essays on behalf of high-school classmates too lazy to do the job themselves. One of his clients is the lovely Norah (Jennifer Lawrence) a troubled beauty with her own dark past. So the parallel lines are laid out for an inter-cut sequence - Porter on a first date with Norah Walter on an anniversary dinner with Meredith. Each tete a tete ends badly paving the way for a matched set of complications and what can only be called a metaphor-free zone. Consider this. When the frustrated teen feels like hes banging his head against a wall he is - literally. When Walter ends up fighting with himself he does - literally. And when the moment comes to sever his hands-on relationship with the Beaver well dont even ask. Yikes literalism abounds but realism proves awfully scarce especially when its time for the third act to organize a veritable parade of reconciliation scenes all marched out with unseemly haste. Sure theres lots of pretense but its all the wrong kind - just silliness posing as sensitivity pretending to be art. Yet amid the morass a couple of performances survive. Lawrence so beguiling in Winters Bone has far less to work with here but still manages to make something out of not much giving a flat character compelling shape. As for Gibson everything about him is terribly convincing. He looks tired and strained and haunted and even with that ridiculous Cockney voice like a man who knows a thing or two about the ids dark urgings. Whether this is acting depends I suppose on which film youre watching - the silly movie on the screen or the speculative and graver one that lies somewhere within. You decide.

The Beaver reviewed Mel Gibson puts his dark side to good use. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 6 2011 152 PM The Beaver Mel Gibson puts his dark side to good use. By Dana Stevens Also in Slate Jessica Grose interviews Jodie Foster director of The Beaver. The Beaver I know plenty of people who wouldnt pay to see a Mel Gibson movie if it were the occasion for the Second Coming (or depending on your religious affiliation the first). Gibsons off-screen scandals of the past few years--the anti-Semitism the accusations of domestic abuse the drunk driving the racist hate speech --have repulsed many viewers so thoroughly that the notion of spending two hours looking at the mans face simply strikes them as beyond the pale. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I wont say thatThe Beaver (Summit Entertainment) Jodie Fosters new seriocomic film starring Mel Gibson as a man in the throes of a deeply weird midlife crisis is good enough that diehard Gibson boycotters should compromise their values to see it. But if you continue to be fascinated by this talented volatile messed-up man--if your Mel curiosity hasnt been completely squelched by your Mel disgust--its worth experiencing what may be Gibsons finest performance to date. Advertisement Not everything about The Beaver (from a long-kicked-around script by first-timer Kyle Killen) hangs together--it feels at times as if several different movies have been inexpertly soldered onto the same base. But Gibsons grasp of his character--a depressed toy-company executive named Walter Black whos been kicked out of his house after years spent wallowing in drink and misery--is absolute. Depression and self-hatred are clearly things this man understands from the inside out. At the same time The Beaver gives Gibson a chance to remind us how funny hes capable of being. (Remember the Mel of Lethal Weapon days--the pre-bombastic pre-self-righteous winningly self-deprecating Mel?) There arent many actors who could bring this much hard-won pain and regret to a role in which 90 percent of their screen time was spent interacting with a plush hand puppet. About that puppet Walter hurling his belongings into a dumpster on the day hes finally thrown out by his wife finds a discarded stuffed beaver. Something about the creatures googly-eyed gaze makes him rescue it from the garbage and as he lies on his hotel room floor in a drunken stupor the beaver begins to speak to him--or is he speaking to it?--delivering a harsh no-nonsense pep talk in a thick cockney accent. (Gibson makes no attempt to throw his voice ventriloquist-style when speaking as the puppet--the fact that his lips continue to move normally only adds to the sense of uncanniness.) With a converts sudden zeal Walter decides that this act of externalization represents the only way out of his current slump. He types up cards explaining that the beaver is a ""prescription puppet"" part of a radical new treatment protocol (""Its very big in Sweden"") and begins wearing the buck-toothed creature on his arm everywhere he goes to work to bed in the shower even--creepily but hilariously--while having sex with his wife. Weirdest of all the prescription puppet works at least at first. Walter is soon living back at home reconnecting with his wife and younger son. His teenaged son Porter (Anton Yelchin) keeps his distance convinced that his father whom he already distrusted has lost his marbles for good. Porter himself a depressive in the making forges a tentative connection with the troubled valedictorian at his school ( Winters Bones Jennifer Lawrence sensational in what could have been a throwaway role). At work though Walters furry alter ego is working miracles where his pugnacious management style urges the toy company to new heights of success. Just when beaver-based therapy is starting to seem like the wave of the future Walters mental health takes a turn for the worse and the film grows darker less funny and ultimately more predictable. What seemed for the first hour like a send-up of therapeutic cliches becomes in the second a ratification of them. The final resolution of the Walter/puppet relationship struck me as disingenuously facile--I wont reveal whether the films ending is sad or happy but lets just split the difference and call it sappy. Theres much about The Beaver that feels slightly off; black comedy and feel-good family drama is a tough mix of moods to sustain. Fosters own performance as Walters wife feels curiously stiff and inaccessible. Its notoriously hard for an actor to direct his or herself on-screen which may account for the lack of warmth in Fosters scenes with Gibson. But for all its missteps The Beaver won me over--first for Mel Gibsons raw aching performance and second because this oddball movie is so simply and stubbornly itself. Its not as if theres a glut of dramas out there involving mental illness and semi-aquatic rodents. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"The Beaver review Art imitates life as Mel Gibson plays a wreck |       NJ.com comments The Beaver review Art imitates life as Mel Gibson plays a wreck Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 06 2011 at 822 AM updated May 10 2011 at 1250 PM View/Post Comments Ken ReganHoping to get his career back on track Mel Gibson stars in ""The Beaver."" In ""The Beaver"" Mel Gibson plays a long-married family man with a career in crisis a complicated set of daddy issues and dangerous emotional problems that lead him to drink estrangement violence and a public meltdown. The role was not a stretch. Thats an easy joke perhaps but also a hard truth Once actors become stars private lives and public personas merge both adding to and subtracting from their performances. Lindsay Lohan will never play sweet again. Charlie Sheen can no longer play normal. Except Mel Gibson never did. When he began to self-immolate -- first with the unforgiving ""The Passion of the Christ"" then with the public anti-Semitism drunkenness ugly tirades and threats of violence -- many fans seemed to be shocked. They must have been fans who never had seen his movies. Almost from the time hes had the power to choose his roles Gibson has gone dark. From ""Lethal Weapon"" through ""Braveheart"" and beyond his characters have been unpredictable men filled with rage who expiated their sins through violence and self-destruction. And so once she was set to direct loyal longtime friend Jodie Foster took him the script of ""The Beaver."" Gibsons character in the film is a man so emotionally stifled so dangerously depressed he can no longer relate to anyone. Until one day he picks an animal puppet out of the trash. And invents a character -- a Michael Caine-accented beaver -- to talk for him. Its such a dark metaphor for an actors life -- for this actors life -- that perhaps only a true friend would have the guts to cast him in it. Movie Review The Beaver (PG-13) Summit (91 min.) Directed by Jodie Foster. With Mel Gibson Foster Anton Yelchin Jennifer Lawrence. Now playing in New York. Opens in New Jersey May 20. Rating note The film contains strong language sexual situations alcohol abuse and violence. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS It would be wonderful to say the movie is extraordinary. It isnt. Although Foster -- the patron saint of do-your-homework students -- does a cleanly professional directing job the story has no place to go. Gibsons character has a psychotic break and starts talkin like a Cockney beaver what? Then he has another breakdown and doesnt. Thats pretty much the whole movie and an elaborate subplot with his angry son played by Anton Yelchin (who is oddly far more likable with short hair than with his usual mop of curls) only seems like the padding it is even with wry Jennifer Lawrence as a potential girlfriend. Admittedly Gibson is very good as the deeply disturbed hero -- particularly as he sits alone slugging vodka or mourning the loss of his familys love. But is this really acting? Is it even a performance? At times it feels more like voyeurism -- the leaked videos of a therapy session. Foster who plays Gibsons wife here cracks like a whip on-screen. Her scenes with Gibson have an emotional intensity shes never shown with any co-star and her desperate hope and firm affection for him is almost palpable. This is a person who wants this other person to succeed. Thats the reality this movie really captures -- that and its stars own fractured personality. But thats the sort of thing that only a good friend might manage to catch on film -- and that only an enemy would classify as entertainment.

(Donald Traill/AP) Joe Neumaier Friday May 6 2011 400 AM Title The Beaver With Mel Gibson Jodie Foster. A depressed man will talk only through a beaver puppet. Director Jodie Foster. (135) PG-13 Language. At area theatersThe split personality that comes with celebrity can be tricky Mel Gibsons behavior over the last few years makes it almost impossible now to watch him without thinking of the tabloid catastrophe hes become.If anyone needed to let anything even a puppet do the talking for him its Gibson. Luckily thats what happens in ""The Beaver"" Jodie Fosters oddly engrossing off-kilter drama.Gibson plays Walter the CEO of a toy company who slips into a midlife depression that incapacitates him.His wife Meredith (Foster) kicks him out for the good of their two boys teenage Porter (Anton Yelchin) and grade schooler Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart).Alone and suicidal Walter is saved when he spots a mangy beaver puppet in the trash. Drawn to the toy Walter begins a weird form of self-therapy He can engage with his family and the world when he speaks -- in an Australian accent -- through the puppet he calls The Beaver.Suddenly hes fun and successful as long as you forget hes talking through a puppet.Walters youngest kid loves it though everyone else tolerates The Beaver thinking its temporary. But without him the sad Walter returns.Foster whose previous directorial efforts (""Little Man Tate"" ""Home for the Holidays"") are underappreciated little dissections about family outcasts makes ""The Beaver"" into a similar meditation on sons fighting inner urges to follow in a fathers flawed footsteps.As his dad keeps life at arms length Porter pursues a pretty classmate (Jennifer Lawrence) until hes hindered by dishonesty and distance traits he inherited from Walter.Distance is whats required here to care about Gibson. Though Kyle Killens script becomes trite and predictable Gibson delivers in an uncompromising way. Had Robin Williams or Tom Hanks taken the role the cutesiness would be unbearable. Oddly Gibsons public implosion helps ""The Beaver"" like the beaver helps him.

Mel Gibsons performance here outshines his celebrity gossip factor. Starring Mel Gibson Jodie Foster Anton Yelchin Jennifer Lawrence Cherry Jones Paul Hodge Michelle Ang Riley Thomas Stewart Kris Arnold John Bernhardt Director Jodie Foster Running time 131 Release Opened May 6 2011  Editorial Review Leave it to GibsonBy Jen ChaneyFriday May 6 2011Were supposed to look at the emotionally comatose middle-aged protagonist in ""The Beaver"" and see one man a so-called ""hopelessly depressed"" character named Walter Black.But its initially impossible to look at Walter Black without seeing the actor who plays him Mel Gibson the once-beloved movie star best known lately for that series of angry rants recorded by ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva. Please take note of the key words in that sentence ""initially impossible.""Because heres the astonishing surprise about ""The Beaver"" Despite some missteps this film stands as a moving portrait of a husband and father who reclaims his will to live with the unlikely help of a hand puppet. And the main reason its so moving? Mel Gibson.In a triumph of cinema over celebrity gossip ""The Beaver"" mostly makes us forget about Gibsons madman persona and simply draws us into the story that he and director Jodie Foster who also plays Walters wife Meredith want to tell.That story begins with Walter a man living apart from his spouse and two sons sleepwalking through his job as a toy company CEO and self-medicating by drinking tequila from the bottle. He tries to commit suicide twice and he cant even pull that off. He awakens after both attempts on the floor of his dingy hotel room with a furry beady-eyed beaver puppet -- a cast-off item from home that he hung on to -- attached to his hand. Suddenly Walter is talking to himself using the beaver as his proxy.""Im the only one that knows how you really feel"" the puppet/Walter says adopting a cockney accent. He tells Walter to get up and pull himself together. And thats precisely what the man does returning home beginning to slowly rebuild bonds with Meredith and their younger son Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) and rejuvenating his career all while communicating via an inanimate dam builder that sounds like Michael Caine.Few actors could hold a lengthy on-screen conversation with a beaver puppet and not only find the authenticity in it but achieve real poignancy. But with every element of his performance Gibson conveys the debilitating weight Walter carries. Even the lines in Gibsons face convey a profound sense of grief. When he begins to find happiness again its clearly such a relief both to him and to the audience that we can almost overlook that it all happened because he made friends with a Muppet. Now is Gibsons work so strong because hes drawing from his own struggles? Or do we subconsciously bring our knowledge of the actors back story to our viewing experience thereby making it more touching? All thats clear is that what Gibson does in ""The Beaver"" with the steady guidance of his director and friend Foster works perfectly.What works less well for the film is the side plot involving Walters bitter older son Porter (Anton Yelchin) a high-schooler who gets paid to write papers for other students and Norah (Jennifer Lawrence) a whip-smart cheerleader who seeks Porters assistance in crafting her commencement address. The story line seems to primarily exist to emphasize that people in general are capable of playing pretend when the pain of life becomes unbearable. While thats a valid point it ultimately distracts too much from the central narrative of Walters journey.During the movies third act -- when Walter becomes famous for inventing a new hugely successful toy and being (presumably) the only CEO in America who keeps an animal puppet on his hand -- ""The Beaver"" starts to slip off the rails a bit moving from weirdness grounded in reality to just plain weird. Theres also a drastic practically whiplash-inducing twist that occurs near the end of the film one that changes the emotional color palette from muted gray to pitch black. While its a perhaps necessary step toward bringing the movie to its conclusion tonally it feels off.Those wrong notes aside ""The Beaver"" deserves praise for making an earnest attempt to capture the fissures in a family to show us how easy it is for people who love one another to become mere whispers in each others lives. And yes it does deserve praise for showing us that Gibson still has something to give as an actor no matter what you may think about his personal choices.Theres a scene late in the film when Walter at the height of his newfound fame appears on the ""Today"" show. During an interview with Matt Lauer Walter attempts to explain why Americans are so fascinated with him.""People seem to love a train wreck when its not happening to them"" he says.Some people may come to ""The Beaver"" for the Mel Gibson train wreck. But ultimately theyll stay for a Mel Gibson performance that in spite of the mans reputation still manages to shatter our hearts.

Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 6 2011 1201 a.m. ET Like Thors hammer this ersatz epic bludgeons its victims into submission. Whats more it requires them to stare at the source of their punishment through 3-D glasses. No need for submitting blindly to that. The 3-D process in question is one of those aftermarket fakes that enhances mainly mid-distance bodies and structural elements within the frame so you can take the glasses off during most of the close-ups--and much of the movie is shot in pitiless close-ups. I saw it in IMAX which made everything bigger and louder and therefore worse except for some impressive images of Asgard. Thats the bronze-tinted celestial realm where the young God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) struggles against evil forces and his own impetuousness. The movie itself struggles against all-encompassing ponderousness. When Thor is exiled to Earth cosmic bombast gives way to the terrestrial banality of his romance with Natalie Portmans astrophysicist Jane who talks earnestly about resolving her particle data and knows about Einstein-Rosen bridges the fanciful wormholes through which bad guys and good guys alike shuttle between realms like Metro North commuters. If this is a harbinger of the season to come may heaven and its suburbs help us. Last week the surprise was ""Fast Five"" the enjoyable product of a presumably extinct summer franchise. This week the surprise is that Marvel Studios which did brilliantly with ""Iron Man"" and not disastrously with its sequel has brought forth a concatenation of oafish action sequences and narrative fragments in search of a lighter tone. ENLARGE Chris Hemsworth and the mighty hammer of Thor. Paramount Pictures The actors cant be blamed considering what theyve got to work with. Mr. Hemsworth is a commanding physical presence and a likeable one whenever hes given a chance. (In certain scenes he seems to be reaching for the state of comedic grace that Amy Adams attained in ""Enchanted."") Ms. Portmans character is barely sketched let alone fully drawn. Her intern/sidekick played by Kat Dennings is a cipher. Ditto for the Warriors Three (do you really want to know their names?) and the warrior-maiden Sif (Jaimie Alexander) who on their sojourns to Earth look like refugees from ""Galaxy Quest."" Only Thors evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) gets to declaim any flavorsome lines. Theyre not really good lines since theyre all about being bad though theyre better than the Olympian drivel that Anthony Hopkins must intone as Asgards aging King Odin. All of this leads to the subject of the script for which three writers get final discredit. (No thats not a Writers Guild term.) And the subject of the script leads to the luckless director who had to stage it Kenneth Branagh. Mr. Branagh is an accomplished filmmaker as well as a fine actor; his production of ""Hamlet"" is a model of what filmed theater can be. But what possessed Marvel to hire him? Did they think the celestial conflict between Asgard and the Frost Giants had a Shakespearean dimension? If so the studios decision had a delusional dimension. Mr. Branagh isnt an alchemist who might have turned this dross into gold and hes certainly not an action director though how much that matters is open to question since the action sequences bear all the earmarks of studio-imposed computer-generated (and fuzzily photographed) frenzy. Bodies hurtle armor clanks force fields spark vortexes swirl oceans roil warriors freeze and defrost and none of it conveys a scintilla of feeling. Watch a clip of Jodie Fosters latest film The Beaver starring Mel Gibson. Video courtesy of Summit Entertainment. ENLARGE Jodie Foster Mel Gibson and the titular therapeutic puppet in The Beaver. Summit Entertainment The Beaver Bizarre and belabored yet grimly fascinating ""The Beaver"" opens on Mel Gibson looking anguished while a narrator who sounds a bit like Michael Caine says ""This is a picture of Walter Black a hopelessly depressed individual."" That doesnt seem promising but the film which was directed by Jodie Foster delivers more than it promises--namely a performance that draws on exceptional skill as well as what one irresistibly takes to be the real-life anguish of a movie star whose own life has come to ruin. The narrator as it develops is Walter himself and the toothsome rodent of the title is a glove puppet that he wears on his left hand. Through the beaver Walter suddenly and almost exclusively begins to express himself--in an English accent--to his worried wife Meredith (who is played by Ms. Foster) his dismayed teenage son Porter (Anton Yelchin) and to startled colleagues at work. Im not telling you anything you cant find in the trailer and thats part of the problem with Kyle Killens screenplay. Its a drama that not only depends on a single device--artifice being the writers glove puppet--but deprives us of any sense of discovery by spelling out the devices meaning in a card that Walter gives to everyone he meets ""The person who handed you this is under the care of a prescription puppet designed to create a psychological distance between himself and the destructive aspects of his personality."" Lest that be insufficiently diagnostic the point is emphasized in a pair of parallelisms. Porter writes term papers for other students but cant express himself and Porters artistic girlfriend Norah has given up painting because...did you think Id spell everything out? So whats to recommend in ""The Beaver""? First but not least Jennifer Lawrence playing Norah. I wish this hadnt been her first released film since ""Winters Bone""; the role doesnt deserve her. Still she fills every moment of it--even a manipulative graduation speech--with warmth and graceful intelligence. Then theres the man to the right of the puppet by turns tortured morose animated or charming. When I first met Mel Gibson in Sydney almost 35 years ago he was a handsome young actor with an open face a winning smile an abundant gift and a bright future although no one could have imagined the extent of his success or the depth of his fall. The gift remains. ENLARGE Mickey Rourke plays the trumpet in Passion Play. Image Entertainment/Everett Collection Passion Play Every now and then a movies awfulness rises to the level of mystery. How did it get produced? Did anyone try to save the filmmaker from himself? Given the gloppily sentimental substance of ""Passion Play"" didnt anyone find the title ever so slightly grandiose? This film brings us the resistible pairing of Mickey Rourke and Megan Fox. Hes Nate a battered and lugubrious trumpet player whos down on his luck. Shes Lily an angel with wings--very nice wings with fluffy feathers--who works as a side-show freak in a seedy carnival. ""Do you wanna see my wings?"" Lily asks in a girlish voice. ""If you wanna see them just ask me."" Anyone with any sense would wanna see them so its easy to understand Nates pleasure when she unfurls them and hard to understand the displeasure of a plastic surgeon when Nate nixes the idea of clipping them. ""Amazing as she is"" the surgeon says tartly ""its not normal."" No its not but then neither is a movie so consistently drained of energy that its dialogue is delivered at a steady-state mumble. (The only relief is provided by Christopher Doyles cinematography which fills the turgid stretches with striking images.) This is the directorial debut of Mitch Glazer who worked from his own screenplay. Back in 1988 he and Michael ODonoghue wrote ""Scrooged"" the wonderfully funny update of ""A Christmas Carol"" that starred Bill Murray. This helps to explain Mr. Murrays presence in ""Passion Play"" where he too mumbles his way through a mournful performance as Lilys tormentor a gangster named Happy Shannon. As for Ms. Fox she may have seen the movie as a chance to spread her wings in the dramatic realm but its a no-fly zone for all concerned. DVD FOCUS The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers (2002) Instead of the low-rent adventures of ""Thor"" treat yourself to Peter Jacksons ""The Lord of the Rings."" Any one of the three films will do but this wondrous thunderous spectacle is my favorite. The forces of evil are in the ascendancy during most of the three-hour running time but you can bet the shire on the forces of good--and not just J.R.R. Tolkiens desperate alliance of Hobbits humans and elves. An army of filmmakers led by Mr. Jackson has made the trilogys central section a ringing testament to the power of movies. Magic (1978) The notion of a hero possessed by a puppet or a dummy has long been a horror mainstay in the movies and on TV. I wouldnt be surprised if Kyle Killen had seen ""Dead of Night"" before writing ""The Beaver."" The 1945 English film stars Michael Redgrave as a schizophrenic ventriloquist tormented by his dummy but its unavailable on American home video. A good and creepy alternative is ""Magic"" with the pre-Hannibal Lecter Anthony Hopkins as a ventriloquist whose dummy has a vicious mind of its own. Richard Attenborough directed from a novel by William Goldman. Brewster McCloud (1970) Bud Cort who has a small role in ""Passion Play"" plays the title role in Robert Altmans eccentric--and by now almost unknown--fable about a loner who lives deep below the Houston Astrodome and dreams of flying inside it with a pair of strapped-on wings. Not even the most ardent fans of this seminal American filmmaker--and I count myself among them--would represent ""Brewster McCloud"" as a successful film but its certainly an interesting one. Sally Kellerman is a woman of mystery who may be yes Brewsters guardian angel. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com 22 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Jodie Foster and Mel Gibson star in ""The Beaver."" Photo Ken Regan Summit Entertainment The Beaver review Mel Gibson talks to puppet 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Beaver Drama. Starring Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster. Directed by Jodie Foster. (PG-13. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Thinking Mel Gibson is off his rocker is in no way an impediment to seeing him in ""The Beaver"" in which he plays a man who is off his rocker. Given everything Gibson has done and said in the past year this might be the only sort of role in which audiences would be willing to accept him. The surprise is the lovely job he does with it. He gives a performance of such pain and insight that he makes the case for himself as an actor again not a public spectacle. Indeed this is the best acting he has ever done and its difficult to imagine how another actor more levelheaded and even-tempered - which is to say anybody else - could have brought such reserves of sorrow and disappointment into play. When Gibson stumbles around a room all but suffocated by depression and looking for something with which to hang himself he does not seem like a man walking on the moon. He is not visiting a foreign territory. Gibson has spent his career playing heroes but his channel into self-hatred is direct. He plays suicidal depression without cuteness distance or any plea for sympathy with nothing like the usual hint that a great spirit might be leaving us. He plays it with only unfathomable disappointment and exhaustion so that under the circumstances suicide almost looks reasonable. Is Gibson showing us the character or himself or some combination of the two? You decide. But whoever that is onscreen its the saddest man in the world. Related Stories The Beaver The title derives from the means by which our hero a childrens toy company president named Walter (Gibson) climbs out of his depression. Walter puts on an old beaver hand puppet and hears it speaking to him in a cockney accent bucking him up with tough love. From that point on the puppet never leaves him and he speaks only through the puppet. The puppet is like a drug solving half his problems and causing even deeper ones. Jodie Foster who plays Walters wife directs the film with her usual grasp of emotional dynamics. She knows Gibson well and brings out the best in him but she also invests in the scenes involving Walters teenage son who despises his father but mainly fears ending up like him. Fosters sure hand makes the sons scenes which constitute perhaps a third of the movie almost as compelling as Gibsons beaver interludes. She casts it well too - with the son (Anton Yelchin) and his girlfriend (Jennifer Lawrence) as a pair of inwardly troubled kids discovering a connection. Though the notion of a mans speaking through a beaver puppet gives the movie its necessary dose of eccentricity ""The Beaver"" is nothing but serious a pained astute and fairly grim portrayal of severe mental illness. It forces you to feel the sheer hell of having it and it shows how the misery and difficulty of it reverberates through the family and the community. Theres also an element of social commentary in that Walter because his mental illness is flashy finds himself a media star. As someone observes in the movie ""People love a train wreck when its not happening to them."" How strange that this movie should seem to be commenting on Gibson himself when it was filmed before his recent public scandals. Further how strange that the movie should seem like an apology recorded in advance - or that we should feel like accepting the apology when we werent the ones who were wronged. ""The Beaver"" is a complicated experience that leaves us feeling implicated in our own interest in train wrecks particularly the one onscreen. -- Advisory Adult situations.

"The Beaver movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Lit by its unstable starThe Beaver a 2.5 starsMay 05 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticJodie Foster and Mel Gibson (and a stuffed beaver) in ""The Beaver.""Whatever you think of ""The Beaver"" -- and its both problematic and intriguing enough to elicit at least three contradictory responses from most moviegoers -- director Jodie Fosters film reasserts the feverish defiant often gripping talent of actor Mel Gibson. Though these things cannot be compartmentalized not entirely the actor Mel Gibson stands apart from the off-screen nightmare Mel Gibson as well as the sadistic ""Passion of the Christ"" and ""Apocalypto"" director Mel Gibson. I prefer this Mel Gibson by a pretty fair margin.In ""The Beaver"" he looks as if hes on the verge of a panic attack or an early exit from the filming of the movie itself. He plays Walter the successful head of a toy company who has spiraled into a deep depression to the horror of his wife (played by a dead-serious deeply invested Foster) the skepticism of his valued colleague (Cherry Jones) and the confusion of his two sons. After a failed suicide attempt alcoholic Walter happens upon a furry hand puppet in a large trash bin outside his usual liquor store. The beaver speaks to him in a cockney growl halfway between Ray Winstones and Michael Caines (Gibsons vocal characterization is pretty terrific). ""Im here to save your goddamn life"" it tells him.And it does for a while. Letting the beaver take control of business meetings domestic matters most everything in his formerly sorry life Walter frees himself to be a new and better man albeit a man who speaks in two voices and goes everywhere with a buck-toothed sock on his hand. Walter is but one of several characters in Kyle Killens screenplay struggling to locate an authentic sense of self. The older son played by Anton Yelchin ghost-writes his high school classmates papers and speeches for money. The boys awkwardly developing relationship with the class valedictorian (the excellent Jennifer Lawrence of ""Winters Bone"") takes up fully half the screen time. Yelchin lacks an animating spark and is merely adequate. Gibson does not lack an animating spark; if anything hes shooting off sparks in too many directions. Losing himself in a role rife with discomfiting real-life Gibson parallels in ""The Beaver"" he acts like someone who means it every moment.Hes the reason this strange uncertain picture cant be dismissed. Somewhere in the rewrites ""The Beaver"" apparently veered from black comedy of an accidentally therapeutic sort to a therapy-first drama with accidental bits of black comedy. Watching Gibson and Foster on screen together again youre struck at the unexpected similarities in their borderline-feral intensity. These are performers who do a lot from the neck up busy every second rarely in any sort of repose. Their itchy drive sets the tone for the best of the picture which has been directed with considerable and I think misjudged tact by Foster.She was right to take the central characters despair seriously. Theres no movie if the audience cant do the same. On the other hand the somber nature of the pacing and atmosphere periodically solemnizes ""The Beaver"" into passivity. On the other other hand the one with the beaver puppet on it If Fosters collegial guidance encouraged Gibson to come up with this movie-saving performance it was probably worth it.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for mature thematic material some disturbing content sexuality and language including a drug reference)Cast Mel Gibson (Walter); Jodie Foster (Meredith); Anton Yelchin (Porter); Jennifer Lawrence (Norah); Cherry Jones (The VP)Credits Directed by Jodie Foster; written by Kyle Killen; produced by Steve Golin Keith Redmon and Ann Ruark.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + In ""The Beaver Mel Gibson plays Walter Black a severely depressed CEO who finds a mangy brown hand-puppet in the trash puts it on his arm and proceeds to let it take over his life. Walter speaks through the puppet in the sort of rough British growl that the Scottish actor Peter Mullan used to terrify children in the most recent ""Harry Potter movie. The puppet fails to command Gibson to mount the Stations of the Cross or get back together with Danny Glover. It merely prompts a businessman to get back on top of the world.The most provocative thing about ""The Beaver is the adult-movie title. The film itself is alternately fascinating and dull though mostly the latter. Jodie Foster directed the movie (her third) which Kyle Killen wrote and casts herself in the thankless role of Walters supportive wife Meredith. All Foster has to play is bewilderment distraction and devotion. Why she felt compelled to take work from Kathleen Quinlan is beyond me. Its like watching a hawk do community service by pretending to be a dove. The answer stems in part from her friendship with Gibson. That at least is the window through which this movie best holds your interest as Hollywood allegory. Gibson is a movie star who became a celebrity when a run of strange behavior kept him in the tabloids and seemed to make him persona non grata in the entertainment industry.Hes worked in the years since but this is the first movie to turn his various meltdowns into psychodrama. Walter says hes sick and he wants to get better. The puppet has other plans. Walter moves back into the familys house but talks to Meredith and their two boys only as the puppet which also resumes control of the toy company. Success turns Walter and the beaver into media phenomena. Foster alternates between shots of only the beaver affixed to Gibsons upright arm and those that show Gibson speaking while the beaver gesticulates. And she allows us to experience the intense discomfort of being in the presence of a man whos coming apart.Of course weve been here before with Gibson. We are in fact quite often here no? ""The Beaver extends an odyssey into masochism that began when Gibson was an intimidating beauty in his mid-20s and continued when he became a hot-headed cop in the ""Lethal Weapon films and a paranoid loose cannon in movies like ""Conspiracy Theory. Foster merely frames this latest round of self-aggression as a kind of cry for help. As Walter Gibson looks like he might die. And yet when hasnt Gibson made a film in which he looks that way?At various stages Jim Carrey and Steve Carell were attached to the film. But with Gibson playing Walter the movie seems personal for Foster like an attempt to rehabilitate her buddy in the eyes of the public. Walter and the puppet appear opposite Matt Lauer on ""Today (where Gibson tells America that ""crazy is pretending to be happy) Terry Gross on ""Fresh Air and Jon Stewart on ""The Daily Show. If the movie itself is so otherwise bland that what emerges in its foreground is a story about Mel Gibson what are we to make of this aspect of Walters resurgence? Should Stewarts participation put Gibsons anti-Semitic rants behind us? Or are we merely bracing ourselves for satire that never lands?It almost doesnt matter. ""The Beaver is so unsure of how weird to find any of this that it dumps us into a different movie in which Walter and Merediths antsy resentful teenage son Porter (Anton Yelchin) begins a relationship with his classs sexy popular valedictorian (Jennifer Lawrence) who hires him to write her graduation speech. So this movie-star cry from the heart is also another story of an American family generically on the rocks. Will Porter forgive his father for leaving? As compelling as Gibson is and good as Yelchin and Lawrence are the movie needs more than its tabloid meta-drama to seem stronger than an extra-long episode of network television. There are darker less ordinary places for this movie to go.Once upon a time the story of a miserable suit or working stiff would have brought out the most histrionic version of Jack Lemmon whose breakdowns in a movie like ""Save the Tiger carried the weight of the world. Gibson can fly even further off the rails than Lemmon but ""The Beaver stays put. Its unclear what about life or depression Foster and Killen are really saying. A movie about a man hiding behind a puppet is also a story about a movie hiding behind its star. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Jodie Foster has been touring the country with her film The Beaver prefacing each screening by imploring viewers not to expect a comedy. Rarely has a director seemed so publicly obsessed with the need to manage audience expectations and its particularly remarkable coming from an artist as assured as Foster. But in The Beavers case even more advance preparation seems necessary Perhaps she should also remind people that the film was shot in 2009 before her star and longtime friend Mel Gibson had his drunken tirades recorded and released to the public and that the film isnt meant to respond to that scandal. But no amount of setup is likely to dissuade audiences from seeing a little of Gibsons life in The Beaver in which he plays an alienated family man substituting a more confident relatable personality for his own. And the ""Its not a comedy"" screed fits oddly with the films first half which exaggerates his characters situation for bleak belly laughs. But while The Beaver starts with Gibson in What Women Want slapstick mode it eventually goes to such exaggerated extreme places that it becomes as much of a must-watch train-wreck as Gibsons own real-life situation. Gibson stars as a suicidally depressed businessman who adopts a beaver puppet as a survival tactic. Addressing the world only through the toy (and giving people a card that says hes ""under the care of a prescription puppet"") he gets a new lease on life but his wife (Foster) strains to accept the cost of his new happiness while his teenage son (Anton Yelchin) rejects it outright. Essentially The Beaver is a less-accepting less gentle though equally quirky version of Lars And The Real Girl wherein a disaffected loner bootstraps himself back into society via a broad unlikely pretense and his friends family and co-workers have to decide whether they can play along. But The Beaver is more manic than Lars and the stakes are higher and harder to buy. Gibsons personal life aside hes too broad and goofy to bring across the storys dramatic aspects and his affected darkly whimsical plotline fits poorly with the more moderate B-story involving a tentative John Hughes-ian bonding between Yelchin and a classmate (Jennifer Lawrence) who wants him to write her valedictorian speech. There are a lot of reasons to be interested in The Beaver for Foster fans (its her first directorial project since 1995s Home For The Holidays) for train-wreck fans and culture vultures and for people who like idiosyncratic weird cinema. But Foster might have been better off trying to explain to viewers what The Beaver is rather than what it isnt. Watching it its hard to believe that even she knows exactly what she was making with this strange sprawling tonally confused not-a-comedy.

"The Beaver Mel Gibson stars in ""The Beaver"" Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Jodie FosterMOVIES  REVIEW The Beaver? Just leave itMel Gibsons taut performance cant save Jodie Fosters dark disjointed film.May 06 2011|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC There are all kinds of problems with ""The Beaver."" Ironically Mel Gibson isnt one of them. So for those inclined to set aside the actors alcoholic anti-Semitic rants and his no-contest plea to domestic abuse (and Im not arguing for that) there is a sensitive performance to be found with Gibson creating a sad sobering portrait of depression.Being sold in ads as a whimsical poignant family drama from director-actor Jodie Foster the film is more a torrential downpour of pain. Its story of a family deeply wounded by serious mental-health issues overwhelms a filmmaker whos too earnest too lenient with the script from first-time writer Kyle Killen and too tentative with the actors a strong ensemble that includes Anton Yelchin Jennifer Lawrence and Cherry Jones. All those ""toos"" create an emotional runaway of a film that carries neither the insight nor the uplift to make the weight of its dark journey worth it.The subject itself has significant dramatic potential in a time when depression is rampant in this country and Foster is far from the first director to be drawn to it. Within the last nine months alone weve seen both dark and light cuts at the problem including ""Rabbit Hole"" with Nicole Kidman and ""Its Kind of a Funny Story"" with Zach Galifianakis. In that regard the story of Walter Black (Gibson) is typical. He is an executive whose business is in decline. Hes married with a family he disappoints daily. Now at midlife hes emotionally marooned.One of the films defining images is of Walter floating in his pool on an air mattress still in work clothes soaking wet and unable or unwilling to move. We soon learn drink and depression have put him there. That drenched sensation clings even when hes not drinking and merely facing another day with Gibsons eyes seeming to leak sadness along with the tears.Walter may be depressed but his family is devastated. Foster plays wife Meredith as a woman wrapped so tight by desperation and frustration that a brisk wind might snap her every word spit through clenched teeth. Young son Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) is mostly confused while high school senior Porter (Yelchin) finds his teenage rebellion colored by black fears that he may become his father. It is agonizing to watch Porter using sticky notes to track any tics that mirror his dads and banging his head on his bedroom wall whenever he adds to the list.Family issues clearly tug at Foster -- each of her three directing projects in some way has turned on them starting with 1991s ""Little Man Tate"" about the complications for a working-class single mom trying to raise a genius child. That is where you find the meat of this film as well with Walters free-fall beginning when Meredith kicks him out.A liquor-store buying spree the discovery of a discarded beaver puppet and a failed suicide attempt soon prove life-changing. Still as soon as Walter starts discussing his troubles with the brown buck-toothed cynic (with a Cockney accent) that now resides on his left hand it sort of makes sense. For those who might not understand Walter hands out cards that explain the logic behind the beaver. Its about distancing as a way of dealing with a problem -- though if the film is any indication puppet therapy should never be attempted without a doctors supervision.Still there is a cleverness in the way Killens script deals with narrative problems that would otherwise be impossibly sticky. Walter and the beaver coexist as believably as they do because Walter runs a toy company -- so the ever-present puppet can be written off as either marketing gimmick or genius. Playing both man and puppet would be a challenge for any actor but Gibson pulls it off with aplomb so that we take Walter seriously when we should and laugh at the right bits like the time spent on the talk-show circuit.The film takes a few shots at the media -- its obsession with the wacky and weird. But the movies other significant concerns are tied to Porter with Yelchin (""Star Trek"" ""Terminator Salvation"") excellent at channeling the particular teenage angst of a smart troubled kid struggling to figure life out. Hes constantly torn between his fathers craziness and his crush on the very un-cheerleader-y cheerleader played by Lawrence (""Winters Bone"") and he makes that push and pull of competing loyalties heartbreakingly palpable.But something in all the relationships is not quite right and its not the beaver. For all her accomplishments as an actor -- and they are both extensive and Oscar worthy -- Foster continues to struggle as a director especially when directing herself. She is much better in other hands. Her wife remains so emotionally locked down that even bursts of passion -- a full range of love and anger -- remain strangely unmoving. That disconnect infects the film itself as if the scenes have been almost randomly strung together and left to flutter aimlessly in the wind.On the Mel question -- Gibson does well by his fallen man trying for redemption making it especially tempting to draw parallels with the actors life. The truth is both stories -- real and fictional -- are sad reflections of our times in ordinary ways alcohol depression recovery relapse repeat. As to redemption I dont think ""The Beaver"" will be nearly enough.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--The BeaverMPAA rating PG-13 for mature thematic material some disturbing content sexuality and language including a drug referenceRunning time 1 hour31 minutesPlaying At ArcLight Hollywood Landmark West L.A.

His meltdown in Jodie Fosters new drama The Beaver could help save it By Mary Pols MaryPolsMay 04 2011 Share Read Later Ken Regan / Summit EntertainmentRiley Thomas Stewart and Mel Gilbson in The Beaver Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Just for a moment lets put aside our memories of Mel Gibsons haggard mug shots and raging bigoted meltdowns. Instead imagine him fresh off a new Lethal Weapon movie or even a bloody religious epic that triumphed at the box office. His new movie The Beaver about a man in the midst of a psychotic break would seem something of a hard sell -- a divergence from the Gibson brand. Under the direction of his old friend and loyal supporter Jodie Foster Gibson plays Walter Black a man so crippled by mental illness that he believes a ratty bucktoothed beaver hand puppet is both alive and in charge of his destiny. Neither slap-happy comedy nor aggressive action fare The Beaver is a somber sad domestic drama featuring an alcoholic in acute crisis. Sound familiar almost like a documentary? Its hard to separate Gibsons true-life story from whats happening onscreen. In 10 years when the actors ugly domestic disputes with ex-lover Oksana Grigorieva will have faded from our minds The Beaver may just seem profoundly odd. But the way its themes dovetail with Gibsons disgrace make it -- peculiarly enough -- the right film for him to have made in this very wrong moment. Plucked from a Dumpster the Beaver bullies depressed uncommunicative Walter out of suicide and gives him the will to live and a Cockney accent. Puppet on hand Walter returns to his wife Meredith (Foster) whod tossed him out the day before. He pretends hes participating in a radical new treatment program (""Its very big in Sweden"") and begins to rebuild his life. The narrative sounds like a zany pitch from a parody of Hollywood filmmaking (like Robert Altmans The Player). It sounds weird and it is weird. Were as skeptical as Walters son Porter (Anton Yelchin) a cynical high school senior who is appalled that his mother is giving Walter another chance (Porter has covered his bedroom walls with notes on his fathers behavior and character traits a sort of to-not-do list). But theres a dignity in Kyle Killens screenplay a quiet conviction that steadily woos us just as Walter wins back the affections of his neglected younger son Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) and even convinces Meredith to let him back into her bed. (He and the Beaver pant in tandem after climax a bit of creepy humor that would send most of us sprinting toward the spare room; Meredith merely turns away politely.) Walter is the CEO of a toy company hes never been particularly interested in so his employees are dumbstruck when he shows up in a natty suit -- furry puppet held aloft -- ready to shake up the business. The Beaver inspires a Tickle-Me-Elmo-size success with a new woodcutting kit for kids catapulting Walter onto magazine covers and TV programs where the Beaver continues to speak for him. It doesnt matter that the man is a freak show as long as hes making money hand over fist -- a meta-irony that Foster plays for broad laughs in a montage (best celebrity cameo NPRs Terry Gross). Eventually the media blitz devolves into something sadder as we see Walter cycle through his 15 minutes of eccentric fame ceding more and more of himself to the Beaver. The puppet is quick-witted and charming but also consistently menacing -- which reminds us of course of Gibson the very bad boyfriend and tabloid star. After tapes leaked of Gibsons malice-soaked conversations with Grigorieva distributors pushed The Beavers release date from the fall of 2010 to the following March and then May presumably in the belief that the moviegoing public needed some time off from Gibson. We would need yet more time off to get a clean reading of The Beaver. But even if Walters desperation and downward spiral resonate more because of Gibsons decline -- his ravaged features are constant evidence of his tumultuous life -- the actor deserves credit for the vulnerability and poignancy of his performance which recalls his work in 1993s The Man Without a Face and even 1979s Tim in which he plays a developmentally disabled laborer. Gibson doesnt share much screen time with Yelchin but the young actors performance is crucial to the movie. Porter is an outsider who longs to be free of his childhood particularly his father; hes funding his escape by writing papers for classmates at a tidy profit. While his burgeoning relationship with a lush cheerleader (Winters Bones Jennifer Lawrence) is predictable -- she too has a secret pain -- we are grateful for all the time we spend with the compelling Porter. His struggle to understand and accept his fathers limitations echoes our own he gives us a reason not to write Walter off as a hopeless loon. Yelchin is intensely present in the role in contrast with Foster whose portrayal of Meredith has the sense of an afterthought -- as if she were too busy under her directors hat worrying about other peoples performances to put much thought into her own. But Foster merits praise for putting her energy into a movie about mental illness that goes beyond the slickness of As Good as It Gets in which a happy ending can be spun from a patients mere promise to take his medication. There is one element of The Beaver that does reflect a Hollywood sensibility Walters breakdown never threatens the family financially. The narrative would have more tension if they didnt appear so comfortably padded in a Nancy Meyers-like milieu. (Meyers directed Gibson in 2000s What Women Want a feel-good movie that now seems very far in his past.) But despite that and the ludicrousness of the puppet prop The Beaver is serious about portraying mental illness. And whatever your opinion about Gibson the man so is Gibson the actor.

Thats a compliment. Puffy pasty haggard and dragging his feet with a heaviness that suggests each step is exhausting Gibson fully conveys the suicidal depression that ails his aptly named character Walter Black. The commitment is all the more unnerving to anyone who knows anything about the star whose familiar features we are invited to study in unflinching close-up. Which lets face it is everyone who will see The Beaver This is high-quality work from a professional who news reports have suggested has recently sunk to terrible lows in his nonprofessional life. One can conjecture what techniques of Method acting and recesses of psychological complication led this man to play this part this way at this time. Or (why not?) one can take this odd gnarled picture -- a captivating premise from Austin-based writer Kyle Killen and his first produced feature screenplay -- at its fictional worth. Gibsons Walter is a tormented middle-aged man whose severe mental illness is ruining his work life as a successful toy manufacturer. His affliction is also destroying his home life as the father of two sons and husband to his concerned wife Meredith (played with her reliable elegant briskness by Jodie Foster who also directs). Depression has stranded Walter at the end of his rope all but literally. He might have finally succeeded at suicide if he hadnt found a discarded hand puppet in the unlikely ? form of a beaver -- cue sniggering from the kids on South Park. Who would have predicted that something about putting that puppet on his left hand and talking as the beaver in a beaver-by-way-of?Michael Caine accent would allow Walter to break from his distressed old self and start afresh? Its crazy stuff no doubt. Walters wife thinks so try as she does to support her husbands recovery. His older son Porter (a great live-wire performance from the consistently wonderful Anton Yelchin) thinks so too and hates his father all the more because he sees signs of the old mans illness in himself. (Besides Porter is anxious to appear normal to an alpha classmate he likes coolly played by Jennifer Lawrence.) Only Walters younger son (Riley Thomas Stewart) likes the puppet because Hey A talking beaver Anyway clearly something must give How long can Walter run a business or make love to Meredith with a clod of brown cloth covering one hand? And yet right there right at that point of fascinating tension The Beaver goes soft. It turns into something not nearly as interesting as its dark first half. It becomes in the end a weird but oddly traditional story about a family in peril and about an angry son and about a wife/mothers struggle to protect her (unusual) loved ones by any means necessary. Which is to say The Beaver becomes less Walters tale -- an adventurous character study by a passionate Mel Gibson -- and more the kind of material Jodie Foster has been drawn to both as an actor and as a director in variations as different but linked as Little Man Tate Panic Room Nell and The Brave One. Those stories are nice and all -- but why go to all the trouble of introducing a beaver and then take away the power of its impressive teeth? B?

By Rex Reed  05/03/11 1152pm Watching Mel Gibsons relentlessly reckless self-destruction has been about as much fun as standing by helplessly observing a truck jackknife on a crowded turnpike. This is what it must have been like in the old days when Fatty Arbuckle ruined his career with a Coke bottle and Frances Farmer went from Cary Grants leading lady to being dragged kicking and handcuffed to the insane asylum. If Mr.Gibson has any fans left nows the time for them to rally. The occasion is The Beaver a brave and unusual film directed by his longtime friend Jodie Foster and a good reason for his defense team to say ""I told you so."" The movie is a study of clinical depression and eccentricity two subjects with which the star has had some firsthand experience about the need to extend tolerance and compassion for people who are not exactly on the same page as everybody else. It has elements of soul-searching reflected through the lens of black comedy but once you recover from the basic conceit you wont find much to laugh about. Mr. Gibson looking weary and ravaged plays Walter Black a hopelessly unhappy toy company executive who has lost his ability to take interest in life. Hes tried drugs and therapy without much success and sleeps for hours at a time day and night. Meanwhile his family is falling apart around him. His wife Meredith (Ms. Foster) struggles to function but gets no help from her husband. When he sleepwalks through office hours drinks excessively and even flagellates himself to stay awake she finally throws Walter out of the house. Their nervy 17-year-old son Porter (the talented Anton  Yelchin) who despises his absentee father is in big trouble at school for running a lucrative business ghosting and selling homework to his classmates; their youngest son Henry (Riley Thomas a standard-issue moppet from Hollywood Casting) is victimized by bullies and whining to get his daddy back. Then in the serious stages of committing suicide the dejected Walter discards all of his belongings in the trash and experiences a miracle. In a dumpster he finds a discarded glove puppet with the face of a beaver and finds a way to communicate. He sends a note to everyone he knows informing them the hand puppet has been prescribed by his doctor as a form of rebirth and insisting they address it instead of him.  After an understandable period of adjustment people go along with the gag. Speaking through the cockney voice of the beaver Mr. Gibson sounds like a gravelly Michael Caine. Henry loves it; Walters sex life with Meredith is rejuvenated; and the beaver even inspires a new toy that rescues his company from bankruptcy to the joy of the frustrated marketing director (Cherry Jones). Obviously a complete mental breakdown is on the way as the film shifts from whimsy to lurid melodrama from the Black Swan school of dark delusion. Add a teen subplot about a mysterious cheerleader (Jennifer Lawrence from the ghastly critically overrated Winters Bone) who pays Porter 500 to write her graduation speech. Too bad he didnt also write the screenplay. The Beaver has moments of cogent emotional realism but most of the time you dont know whether to laugh or cry. Jodie Fosters balanced gimlet-eyed and level-headed direction prevents the eccentricity from getting too wonky. The result is an offbeat film that is definitely not everyones cup of Prozac but its understated introspective sense of self-discovery and reinvention in the most fragile of lives is admirable. I did not find the redemption and rehabilitation in Kyle Killens script totally persuasive; the ending is too tidy to piggy back the heavy metaphoric load that precedes it; and the scenes where Matt Lauer and Jon Stewart both interview the Beaver on network television are downright ludicrous.  But even when satire threatens to de-rail the most sobering intentions the marvel of Mel Gibsons conviction lifts The Beaver back on the right track. Tightly controlled and uniquely troubled Walter Black is a difficult role. With eyes like watery wounds maybe Mr. Gibson is not even acting. The hand puppet becomes his alter ego a theatrical device to separate him from the negative aspects of his personality and although its odd and sometimes exasperating he plays every transitional mood swing with grace and a kind of madness that becomes magnetic. Ms. Foster is a perfect soulmate. She even gets used to sharing her bed with the Beaver but her patience wears out when after 20 years of marriage Walter insists on attending their intimate anniversary dinner with the puppet dressed in a miniature tuxedo. Who can say what works when it comes to dealing with mental illness. To anyone who has ever experienced the pain of fighting off clinical depression it seems like a perfectly logical modus operandi-until the Beaver assumes too much power and turns into a control freak. The only way to get rid of him is to lose part of yourself. Whatever you think of Mr. Gibson whatever he has lost he still has talent and here displays acting of power and resonance. Its a pleasure for a change to see the best side of his split personality at work. rreedobserver.com The Beaver Running time 91 minutes Written by Kyle Killen Directed by Jodie Foster Starring Mel Gibson Jodie Foster Anton Yelchin 3/4 Comment Filed under Jodie Foster Mel Gibson movie Movie Review Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/culture/movie-review-could-ithe-beaveri-resurrect-mel-gibson?utm_medium=partial-text&utm_campaign=author,200,thebeaver30,thebeaver,observer

Photo The Beaver focuses in part on the love triangle among a depressed man (Mel Gibson) his wife (Jodie Foster) and his favorite puppet. ( ) Mad Mel Gibson as a depressed man struggling with serious mental problems grabs your attention like a car wreck in Jodie Fosters ""The Beaver."" This bizarre little movie is all over the place as drama -- but genuinely compelling as a one-of-a-kind piece of public self-flagellation. Its impossible to watch Gibsons superb performance as a troubled man who employs a hand puppet for a most peculiar kind of self-help without wondering how much its informed by his well-publicized personal demons (see Gibson timeline on page 40). Even as Kyle Killens script becomes ever more implausible and ultimately ridiculous its impossible to take your eyes off the screen when the tortured and ill-looking Gibson is center stage. Hes Walter Black the ""hopelessly depressed"" CEO of a toy company on the verge of bankruptcy. During the rare moments when he isnt actually asleep Walter is a walking zombie. His fed-up wife Meredith (Foster) is particularly concerned about the toll that Walters two-year journey to the dark side is taking on their teenage son Porter (Anton Yelchin) and his younger brother (Riley Thomas Stewart). Exiled to a motel Walter stops on the way to buy out a liquor store -- one of many touches that will have you thinking about Gibsons tabloid exploits -- and impulsively fishes a ratty beaver hand puppet from a Dumpster outside. That night our boozy hero makes a couple of abortive suicide attempts -- the second interrupted by the Cockney-accented voice of the puppet (Gibson sounding not a little like Michael Caine). Coming to after a fall Walter receives a pep talk from The Beaver who he manipulates on his hand and speaks through. Suddenly Walter is sort of his old perky self -- though he lets his alter ego who he identifies in printed cards he hands out as a ""prescription puppet"" do most of the talking. His wife delighted with Walters new demeanor goes along -- to a point. A model of co-dependency she welcomes him home even though she finds sharing their bed with The Beaver a bit weird. Its more problematic when she insists on an anniversary celebration without The Beaver -- this scene may be the best acting that Gibson has done in his entire career. Its also one of the few scenes where Gibson speaks in something like his own voice rather than The Beavers cockney twang. Even stranger is Walters return to work where he introduces The Beaver -- who proposes a new beaver-themed woodworking kit that turns the company around. Its possible at first to accept this as a surreal comedy in the vein of ""Lars and the Real Girl"" another film in which people go along with the lead characters delusions. Unfortunately director Foster lets the tone shift during the too-long periods when the movie focuses on Walters older son who despises his father. Even though much of this seems like generic teen angst it forces you to consider Walters behavior in a more realistic context. Wouldnt the wife get Walter committed soon after he showed up with The Beaver? Would his employees really obey orders from a hand puppet? Gibsons deeply committed performance helps get you past this but only so far. Until Foster and Killen come up with a climax that doesnt work. At. All. Im not sure that ""The Beaver"" is going to change peoples minds about Gibson whose anti-Semitic racist and misogynistic outbursts are all-too-well documented. Foster has certainly provided him with a unique mea culpa -- and one of the most unusual comebacks in Hollywood history. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Two and a Half Men return being explored CBS head confi...

Hoberman Mel Gibson Is Crazy (in The Beaver) Wednesday May 4 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman An earnest intermittently droll dramedy about a manic-depressive toy manufacturer and his bewildered family The Beaver is a parable thats not easily parsed. While director Jodie Foster fails to maintain a consistent tone--could there be such a thing as inspirational satire?--the movies lopsided wobble is undeniably enhanced by her star Mel Gibson--or at least by the baggage he schleps into the proceedings. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Walter Black (Gibson) is first seen floating in the chlorinated limbo of his backyard swimming pool; barely able to formulate a sentence hes been diagnosed as ""hopelessly depressed"" and once his exasperated wife (Foster) kicks him out of their Westchester digs hes ineptly suicidal. As Walter trembles drunk and disconsolate on the ledge of his motel roof the movies mysterious Cockney-accented voiceover (a ruder version of the gecko that sells insurance on TV) is revealed to be that of Walters manic self--a ratty hand-puppet discovered in a dumpster that once it starts talking to him offers a means to reinvent himself back into the world.Theres no attempt to make it seem that Walter can throw his voice; on the contrary the camera tends to focus on Gibsons lips flapping as he brandishes the puppet hes dubbed The Beaver. Still Kyle Killens script a highly regarded property long thought impossible to produce elaborates on the ventriloquism theme with a subplot involving Walters eldest son Porter (Anton Yelchin); busy as a beaver furnishing term papers to order this Ivy League-bound high school senior is hired by the schools smartest girl (Jennifer Lawrence) to ghostwrite her valedictorian address.Speaking through even as he hides behind his furry friend Walter returns home. His younger son is delighted; his wife gets with the program once The Beaver explains that hes been prescribed by a shrink. Walter jogs and showers with the puppet; he also uses it to address his employees inspiring them to mass-produce something called the ""Mr. Beaver Wood-Cutting Kit."" The puppet is even there for the movies kinkiest (and most inadvertently funny) scene as Gibson enacts some hot conjugal sex with the movies perpetually harried-looking director.Gibson gives Walters manic jag suggestive verisimilitude--particularly after the wood-cutting kit becomes a runaway hit and he takes to the airwaves appearing with the Beav on Good Morning America riffing with Jon Stewart and interviewed by Terry Gross who wonders why he needs his prop for a radio show. Theres no way that Jim Carrey or Steve Carell each formerly attached to the project could have supplied this frisson. Gibson may be no ones idea of a method actor but his pleasure playing nut-jobs most apparent in the comic thriller Conspiracy Theory seems weirdly confessional. (His more celebrated predilection--being beaten up on-screen--is also present at the hand [sic] of The Beaver.)Shot in autumn 2009 The Beaver was shelved when the monster from the Gibson id erupted last summer with revelations that he was verbally and physically abusing his girlfriend and it has returned as something like a celluloid explanation. (Gibson pleaded no contest to a battering charge a week before the movie had its world premiere at SXSW.) Thanks to this lurid prequel The Beaver manages to be both exploitative and humanizing; thanks to Gibsons convincing conviction it goes surprisingly deep into madness before resolving itself in a nimbus of New Age platitudes.Foster might have treated the material as an E.T.A. Hoffmann tale of demonic possession or a believe-it-or-not Oliver Sacks case history with the puppet functioning as Walters transitional object. Instead she takes it at face value. Is The Beaver an allegory on acting? Directing? Its tempting to imagine Foster herself talking through the increasingly nasty puppet; the movies this former child-star has directed or produced have been notably interested in unique prodigies with unusual ways of communicating.In Little Man Tate Foster directed herself as the mother of an immaculately conceived kid genius; in Nell Foster herself was the genius a backwoods wild child with an invented language. She takes the maternal role in The Beaver--allowing Gibson the fun of babbling on like a hyperactive eight-year-old--but she clearly identifies having cited her own struggle with depression in flacking the movie. Perhaps thats the problem. Mels character isnt on Prozac but the movie is--a succession of bland camera setups cued to a highly conventional score. Would that the direction were half as nutty as the script or as wacked-out as its star1 The gentle fatherly touch of Mel GibsonKen Regan Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

As directed by Jodie Foster from the screenplay by first-timer Kyle Killen the story takes an irreverent plot and makes it uniformly familiar if not entirely unpleasant. Gibson demonstrates a staunch commitment to his role as an emotionally damaged man driven to excise his troubles by speaking through the titular hand puppet but the subdued tone brings him down to earth. Donning a constant scowl Gibson plays Walter Black a supremely depressed man equally frustrated by his flailing marriage and his job as the CEO of the toy company he inherited from his father. A succession of early scenes track these developments before Walter says a single word although the thick Australian voiceover narration laying out his life turns out to be his invented alter ego. The night his wife (Foster) kicks him out Walter discovers the puppet in a dumpster and ends up passed out in a hotel room with the dirty discovery on his arm. The next morning the beaver has a voice -- the aforementioned narrator -- and announces its therapeutic intentions. ""Do you wanna get better?"" Walter asks himself through his newfound creation. ""Im the beaver and Im out to save your goddamn life."" With that sort of dialogue viewers may expect something strange or farcical to come next but ""The Beaver"" attempts to stay within real world constraints proceeding to explore the fallout of Walters mania in straightforward fashion. The story extends to Blacks estranged teenage son Porter (Anton Yelchin) a moody prodigy resigned to applying his smarts by doing other students homework for a price. While Walter attempts to cure himself Porter attempts to cure fellow classmate Norah (Jennifer Lawrence also seen alongside Yelchin in the recent Sundance winner ""Like Crazy"") the valedictorian who hires him to write her graduation speech but refuses to face the recent drug-related death of her brother. These developments take place with understated humorless conviction placing emphasis on the introspective process of self-discovery in both strands of the plot. Rarely does any scene involve more than two or three characters engaged in grave conversations about their troubled lives although the beavers whimsical lines occasionally spice up the dialogue. Still Killens script (one of two playing at the South by Southwest Film Festival to have once been on the Hollywood Black List along with ""Source Code"") practically begs for stage treatment where the unseemly blend of familial reconciliation and mentally unstable behavior could find room to breathe. Cinematically speaking ""The Beaver"" is fundamentally simplistic; it only works because the cast deliver the goods in a few understated scenes. Whenever Killens script aims higher -- such as the uneven hints of media satire when Black conducts interviews as the beaver with Matt Lauer and Jon Stewart -- its philosophical core starts to become thin. The strongest thread involves an ongoing contrast between Walter and Porter whose finicky disposition provides the up-and-coming Yelchin with his most refined role yet. With tightly controlled performances and uniquely eccentric events ""The Beaver"" is mainly undone by the lack of a satisfying outcome. Fosters willingness to indulge the scripts odd tonal shifts provide its most welcome conceit and Gibson helps maintain them. His solo scenes are both absurd and darkly unsettling for several reasons some of which depend on your tolerance for watching the notoriously bad-tempered actor well lose his temper Whether awkwardly failing to hang himself in a bathtub or beating himself up with a guitar Gibson demonstrates an expansive madness that suggests a much darker more involving psychological transition. No matter how straight Foster makes the material ""The Beaver"" only succeeds when it veers off the beaten path. HOW WILL IT PLAY? Given that the premise implies a broad comedy and Gibsons real-life persona has informed its reputation ""The Beaver"" will have an uphill battle getting noticed particularly since its unquestionably weird plot has already thrown people off. However a mixture of morbid curiosity and mixed-positive reviews could translate into a solid if not stunning box office reception. criticWIRE grade B This Article is related to Festivals and tagged Reviews The Beaver More From IndieWireBoJack Horseman Brilliantly Argues Why Comedy Belongs in the Abortion DebateReview Vice Principals Charms With A-Grade Class Clowns But This VP Is No VeepReview Stranger Things is Still Waiting for Something New To Make It Feel AliveReview The Night Of Serial-izes Law amp; Order But Its All About The Verdict Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

By David Edelstein Published May 1 2011 ShareThis (Photo Ken Regan/Courtesy of Summit Entertainment) In The Beaver Mel Gibson is Walter Black a near-catatonically depressed business owner who finds a beaver puppet in a garbage can and begins to talk through it using a blunt cockney accent. Although Walter plainly manipulates the puppet and makes no ventriloquist-like attempt to conceal the movement of his lips the Beaver (who introduces himself as the Beaver) claims to be alive and speaking on Walters behalf. To engage Walter you must literally talk to the hand. Despite its bizarro-world trappings Kyle Killens script is a tidy problem drama exploring the nature of psychological defense mechanisms. Walter through the Beaver explains that instead of living in misery he has wiped the slate clean and become someone/something else. In contrast his teenage son Porter (Anton Yelchin) struggles to remake his own identity in a manner more conventionally psychotherapeutic. Hes stuck Post-its to his wall denoting each of his fathers mannerisms and attitudes and sets out to purge himself of all of them. He has also made it his mission to force a classmate Norah (Jennifer Lawrence) on whom he has an intense crush to confront the death by overdose of her older brother thereby liberating her from the deforming effects of repression. This turns out not to be the fastest way to a young girls heartbut neither at the other extreme is planting a kiss on your spouses lips with a puppet. Perhaps its for the best that were spared the existential dislocation of watching the Beaver venture beneath the sheets Jodie Foster both directed the film and plays Meredith Walters stricken wife and she has muddled her two roles The Beaver is so heavy-spirited it could easily be a Meredith Black film. She never lets you see how Walter could in the short term be liberated by pretending to be the Beaver a rude extroverted creature out for a good time. Shes so afraid of trivializing his suicidal feelings that she forgets shes an artist and not a social worker. The movies glumness is in synch with Fosters performances over the last decade Its as if shes decided that acting is something you mature beyond. Which I suspect had a dampening effect on Gibsons performance. I couldnt wait to see Mel play a tortured soul in The BeaverI was ready to forgive him everything. (Okay almost everything.) His most inspired performance was as a semi-delusional paranoiac in Conspiracy Theory the movie a marvelous change from the usual Make Mel Mad template in which the death or injury of a lover/wife/child/dog drives his characters to murderous vengeance his anger all mixed up with his antic temperament and self-loathing. In Conspiracy Theory he managed to be both zany and poignant. But his Walter never mushrooms into a larger-than-life loon. Because the puppet is doing the talking Gibson bites his lips and turns his face into a blankyou register only the wounded baby blues the sagging features the stupor. Its a depressed performance abstract and unsatisfying. And the Beaver isnt much to look at either being rather ordinary with disappointing anatomically correct small eyes. Killen hasnt used the Beaver to illuminate Walters inner world so the puppet ends up a mere thug Its not much of a surprise when he makes like the dummy in Magic. Gibson is better in the later scenes when Walter tries to escape the Beavers nefarious influence. And Gibsons never bad. Its just that we know how much is missing. As a raging nutcase hes capable of so much more. In his seventies-style gutbucket vigilante picture Hobo With a Shotgun director Jason Eisener aims low and splatters his target all over the screen. Really its hard to see why the NRA is so insistent that the Second Amendment apply to automatic weapons when you can blow peoples intestines out with a simple pump shotgun. Rutger Hauer plays the bum who jumps off a freight train and shuffles with his shopping cart into a dystopian village ruled by a showbizzy crime boss (Brian Downey) who calls himself the Drake and his two sadistic-idiot sons. They like to kill people by fixing manhole covers around their victims heads and Ill spare you. The camera rests on Hauers sickened battered face as people are tortured and we wait for him to get the eponymous weapon and do the righteous thing. Theres something appealing about the movies unpretentious carnival of carnage although I could have done without the flamethrower assault on a school bus to raise the stakes. The most novel element is a filmmaker (Pasha Ebrahimi) who hires bums to fight for the camera gushing over his subjects like a Hollywood agent while they pummel one another. Its a nice touch that Hauer earns the money for his shotgun by eating glass for this director. After he rushes a wounded hooker to the hospital he lingers by the maternity ward and addresses the newborns lamenting the day theyll be crushed by this vile culture victimize others and sell their bodies on the streets. Its an open question whether keeping them away from movies like Hobo would help in that noble goal. 1 2 Next Share this story...

AUSTIN -- A risky bet that pays off solidly Jodie Fosters The Beaver survives its life/art parallels to deliver a hopeful portrait of mental illness that while quirky is serious and sensitive. Despite obvious hurdles with smart marketing it could connect with a wide audience. Those echoes of Mel Gibsons well-publicized breakdowns are impossible to ignore in an opening sequence introducing us to his character Walter Black who first appears floating in a pool arms outstretched like Christs. A few shots later we see this ""hopelessly depressed man"" who has tried everything to remedy his condition flagellating himself like a Catholic penitent. Whether intentional or not this front-and-center reminder works almost as an inoculation to viewers for whom controversy might be a distraction from drama Having put it out there frankly (much as the protagonist will soon do in more outlandish ways with his own issues) the movie kills a bit of our morbid curiosity; our awareness that this depressed character is being played by a troubled actor never vanishes but it is allowed to inform the story at hand. Introducing the films debut here Foster warned that it is not a comedy. Yet Beaver starts firmly in that mode even using upbeat music (Marcelo Zarvos bouncier version of Astor Piazzolas moody tangonuevo) and slapstick to turn Walters suicide attempt -- on the eve of his being kicked out by a wife (Foster) who cant accept his years-long hopelessness -- into an occasion for laughs. The breakthrough Walter has after that failed attempt is also treated lightly though its dead serious for the character He begins dealing with the world through a beaver puppet he rescued from the garbage having come to the conclusion that his own psyche is so irreparable he must ""blow it up"" and start over again. He returns home and to the workplace dealing with people not directly but through the Beaver who speaks with a Cockney accent and shows aplomb with situations that have stymied Walter for years. The readiness with which most people accept this strategy (that Walter presents as a legit psychological therapy invented to distance himself from his pain) is believable in part because it works so well for him -- and Foster stages shots that deftly bring the fuzzy animal to life jostling with Gibson in the frame and occasionally meeting the cameras gaze to help us see him as Walter does. Foster and the script (Kyle Killens first feature) continue to earn non-mocking laughs with the scenario sometimes simultaneously planting seeds of problems to come -- as when husband and wife consummate their reunion with a funny but troubling puppet threesome. The tone takes a firmly dark turn when Fosters Meredith impatient with the ""therapy"" insists on seeing her husband sans Beaver for their anniversary dinner. Exposed and frightened Walter breaks down. Gibson hyperventilating and with eyes darting in panic offers a more affecting less romantically dramatic collapse than some he has created in earlier film roles -- and he continues to underplay this state of mind (darting eyes aside) as the action grows progressively darker. Walters suffering is mirrored by that of his older son Porter (Anton Yelchin) who unlike a younger son who embraces Dads new friend is ashamed of his fathers illness and pained by similarities he sees in himself. A subplot in which Porter is hired to write a speech for the class valedictorian (a seemingly perfect girl played by Jennifer Lawrence suffering her own traumas) looks at first like a straightforward romantic thread but proves to be a poignant reiteration of the movies themes and culminates a bit surprisingly in the films emotional payoff. Its very easy to imagine a less gifted filmmaker producing a train wreck of a film using an identical script -- exaggerating the highs compartmentalizing the lows and casting a mawkish eye on everything from Walters youngest child to his ever-present suffering. Foster finds the scripts subtleties instead and grounds the film with just enough pain to make it work. Viewers who can shake off tabloid preoccupations as they settle into the film will likely be surprised by a picture that (in a way reminiscent of Lars and the Real Girl) turns a crazy-sounding premise into something moving and sane.

Mel Gibson may be the biggest obstacle standing between Jodie Fosters ""The Beaver"" and a wide audience but hes also the biggest reason that audience should exist at all. The troubled actor delivers a performance very few could pull off as a depressed father who begins communicating through a hand puppet but Foster doesnt know how to manage it or navigate the scripts seismic tonal shifts and ends up producing a film thats deeply strange yet incapable of leaving an impression. Absent Gibsons presence the Summit release would be a modest arthouse draw; with it its anyones guess. ""The Beaver"" first came to public attention in 2008 when Kyle Killens debut script was placed atop the Hollywood Blacklist for best unproduced screenplays. Its easy to see why the script attracted such curiosity and its just as easy to see why so many ended up passing on it. One gets the feeling that even the nimblest directors would have struggled to craft this outlandish jumbled story into something that hits the emotional pressure points for which it aims and Foster while a capable and sensitive director isnt up to the task. Bursting out of the gate with a Cockney-accented voiceover the pic gives us a full montage of an average day in the life of Walter Black (Gibson) a ""hopelessly depressed individual."" The CEO of a failing toy company Walter sleepwalks through the rare moments when he isnt actually asleep creating unbreachable gulfs between himself and wife Meredith (Foster) and their youngest son Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart). His other son teenage Porter (Anton Yelchin) despises his father so much that hes compiled a collage of Post-Its listing all of the traits they share so that he can eradicate them one by one. Finally thrown out of the house Walter absconds to a liquor store one of several points in the film where Gibsons personal life either informs or interferes with his character (theres even a self-flagellation scene). There Walter discovers a ratty beaver hand puppet in the dumpster outside. In his hotel room that night with the puppet on his hand and a gallon of booze in his blood he attempts to hang himself in the bathroom. Failing at that he instead heads to the balcony and prepares to jump but falls backwards at the pivotal moment when a loud Cockney ""oi"" distracts him. When he comes to the puppet (or ""the Beaver"" as it asks to be addressed) has taken on a life of its own and gives Walter a tough-love pep talk. Walter is of course manipulating and speaking through the puppet though its unclear whether hes aware of this. After a brief argument/monologue Walter decides to cede complete control of his own voice to that of the Beaver and even prints up a stack of explanatory notecards calling the Beaver a ""prescription puppet"" designed by a psychologist to help distance him from his old mindset. In the early going the jaunty score seems to suggest this is all a dark sort of lark but the film cant decide whether it wants to be a bittersweet study of mental illness or an oddball farce. Walters sudden turnaround from sleepy-eyed zombie to doting father is also limned with off-putting haste as he moves back into the house a new man reconnecting with Henry and most bizarrely reigniting the home fires with Meredith. (A montage of Foster Gibson and the Beaver having wild sex is one of the strangest things anyone is likely to see in a cinema this year.) Craig Gillespies ""Lars and the Real Girl"" succeeded in turning a similarly ludicrous premise into a film with real heart but ""The Beaver"" doesnt have the same confidence in its own merits. Midway through the picture spirals completely out of control heading down one path as a skewed media satire and another much darker one that seems right out of an early Stephen King novella. Gibson is basically flawless in the role giving auds the creeps in the early stages and then managing to suggest a newfound lust for life even though hes only living it through a medium. But his character is handicapped at every step. Most problematically we hardly hear him speak in his own voice (or use his left hand) at all; hence aside from his ""hopeless"" depression we have no real frame of reference for his sudden transformation. Odder still considering the singular strangeness of the character Gibson recedes into the background for large segments of the film with Yelchin getting comparable screentime for Porters tangentially related narrative. A nervy outcast with a thriving underground business writing school papers for his classmates Porter is approached by cheerleader and valedictorian Norah (Jennifer Lawrence who also played a Yelchin love interest in Sundance entry ""Like Crazy"") with an offer of 500 to write her graduation speech. Porter were told has an uncommon ability to get inside the heads of his clients and write in their own voice -- why such intense mimesis should be necessary for writing high school essays is unclear -- and he starts spending time with her as research discovering her secret grief over a recently deceased brother. If this all sounds impossibly cluttered it is. Given more room to breathe these subplots all could have been stitched together but the film is edited at such a skippy pace that theres never time for the audience to get its bearings. Tech credits are of a high quality and the ventriloquist work on the titular critter is expertly handled.
