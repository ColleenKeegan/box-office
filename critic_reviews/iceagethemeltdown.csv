But I think Ive been overruled on this one by the trio of kids who accompanied me to the screening. Simply put all three felt it was too repetitive overly splintered in terms of structure and simply not funny enough. I agree on the first two points but not about the humour which I thought was mostly spot on (one can only deduce that some of the Chuck Jones-style jokes flew over the kids heads).Once again were back in an early evolutionary phase of a planet inhabited by a mishmash of supposedly semi-prehistoric creatures. Unfortunately the ice age is drawing to a close and in an overly obvious reference to global warming the ice cliffs holding back the sea are beginning to melt. Unless the populace starts a mass migration their utopia will turn turtle. In the thick of it are the films three intrepid leads Manny the soft-spoken mammoth (who thinks hes the last of his species); Sid the comical sloth; and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger; while somewhere on the periphery is that squirrel-like creature with an acorn fixation (who provides the biggest laughs). Certainly the storyline wanes towards the end and from the kids point of view the whole package lacks momentum. Which is why theyve threatened me with violence if I give it more than three stars. So I wont.

Graced by vibrant CGI images and sly readings by the three returning top vocal thesps Fox release looks to brighten the spotty early spring B.O. landscape. A tad crasser and pushier than its predecessor ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" is still an entirely serviceable follow-up to the 2002 hit that will thoroughly amuse kids and get a rise or two out of parents as well. Graced by vibrant CGI images and sly readings by the three returning top vocal thesps Fox release looks to brighten the spotty early spring B.O. landscape by approximating the commercial potency of the original which salted away 382 million worldwide and plenty more in ancillary afterlife. ""This global warming is killing me"" an old-timer gripes as he beholds the literal water park the previously frigid neighborhood has become. Blissfully ignorant of the climatic threat about to strike them the happily integrated creatures live in a fools paradise romping and sliding and goofing around in the verdant playground that used to be an ice palace. Lest one imagine however that ""Meltdown"" is a socially conscious propaganda piece in a way the opposite is true; global warming rather than being blamed on anyone (all human characters have been eliminated this time around so theres no one to blame) is presented as a natural phenomenon with which the planets guests must cope. The first to notice somethings amiss is Scrat the beleaguered rodent whose initial attempt to secure an ever-elusive nut is frustrated when he runs out of body parts to plug up holes in an increasingly bursting dam of ice. As before the Scrat running gag reps a memorable highlight that revives an antic Chuck Jones-style comedy of frustration. Before long the happy campers once again dominated by sad sack mammoth Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) mordant saber-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and dufus-y sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) realize the doomsayers are right -- the ice cliffs surrounding them wont hold much longer. To avoid the coming flood the beasts and critters must travel three days up valley to a waiting ark. With Manny suffering from the impression he may be the last mammoth on Earth the ponderous journey acquires a little emotional oomph with the arrival Ellie (Queen Latifah) a mammoth convinced shes a possum to the point that she sleeps hanging upside down by her tail from a tree. Part of her problem -- and the films -- is she keeps incessant company with two manic possums (Seann William Scott Josh Peck) who prove that one hyperactive character (a position already locked down by Scrat) is enough for any film. Diego demonstrably feels the same way and one increasingly wishes he would succeed in his wish for a possum snack. Through their journey the wayfarers are threatened by a couple of nasty big-toothed amphibians and are followed by a flock of vultures whose very clever reworking of the tune ""Food Glorious Food"" from ""Oliver"" performed as they peer drooling down on what they hope will be their next meal reps the musical highlight. Style and approach of the sequel are of a piece with the original picture on which present helmer Carlos Saldanha was co-director (to Chris Wedge whos now exec producer). Lori Forte remains as producer. New writers Peter Gaulke Gerry Swallow and Jim Hecht supply plenty of decent jokes that Romano Leguizamo and Leary deliver with every bit of drollery they can summon but theres a small new anxiety to please that differentiates the tone somewhat from the first outing. Not that the small fry will notice. Ice Age The MeltdownProductionA 20th Century Fox release of a 20th Century Fox Animation presentation of a Blue Sky Studios production. Produced by Lori Forte.

To those fans of the cute 2002 animated comedy ""Ice Age"" let me just say this Scrat is back. For the uninitiated Scrat is a wordless wild-eyed squirrel who spent all of ""Ice Age"" frantically trying to capture an acorn. Like Charlie Brown and the football the goal proves elusive but his efforts are wildly inventive. In the sequel ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" hes got more adversaries to face melting ice a school of fish a bird whos mistaken the acorn for an egg. Does he eventually capture his hearts desire? Well ... lets just say that his travails have more suspense than many a Hollywood blockbuster. Scrat however is just a subplot in the enjoyable sequel ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" which picks up where the last movie left off. The Ice Age it turns out is coming to an end (yes global warming is mentioned) and the characters frozen world is quickly turning into a giant water park. Manny the mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the tiger (Denis Leary) must journey to the other end of their vast valley to avoid the gush of water from a melting glacier. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Ice Age The Meltdown"" with the voices of Ray Romano John Leguizamo Denis Leary Queen Latifah Seann William Scott Jay Leno Will Arnett Josh Peck. Directed by Carlos Saldanha from a screenplay by Peter Gaulke Gerry Swallow and Jim Hecht. 90 minutes. Rated PG for some mild language and innuendo. Several theaters. Along the way they pick up a few new friends including a love interest for Manny (a female mammoth named Ellie voiced by Queen Latifah) and a pair of scene-stealing mischief-making possums who enjoy high-fiving. Watch for these two to star in their own spinoff movie soon as soon as they get a decent agent. Directed by Carlos Saldanha who co-directed ""Ice Age"" the film feels visually richer than its predecessor (thanks to all that plain white ice melting) but has the same brand of uncomplicated all-ages charm. (It even has a musical number a crew of vultures watching the marching animals perform a rendition of ""Food Glorious Food."") And of course theres Scrat and his beloved acorn. In one scene he holds it momentarily before losing it again hugging it to his chest as if hes achieved his hearts desire. Its a love story writ small and its cuter than a homemade valentine.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox) In this photo provided by 20th Century Fox Manny the woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) gets some troubling news from Fast Tony (voiced by Jay Leno) in ""Ice Age The Meltdown."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox) Photo X Manny the Mammoths hormones heat up as environmental changes bring Meltdown 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Ice Age The Meltdown Animated comedy. With the voices of Ray Romano John Leguizamo Denis Leary and Queen Latifah. Directed by Carlos Saldanha. (PG 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) After recent animated movies have offered bad guys in the form of evil wizards diabolical dictators and even Nazi falcons ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" presents a villain that isnt going to sell a lot of night-lights. Global warming. You heard right -- other than a handful of vultures and a couple of predatory fish the best that the three writers responsible for this sequel could come up with to move the story forward is some melting ice. Consider it a credit to the technical crew at Blue Sky Studios that the finished product is still passable entertainment because its clear this movie was made primarily to sell more Burger King swag. Well let the adult cynicism stop there and give ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" a few compliments because it looks fantastic and kids are bound to enjoy it. More than any other computer animation house outside of Emeryville the creators of ""Robots"" and the original ""Ice Age"" are offering Pixar some visual competition -- designing gorgeous landscapes and memorable characters who always look handsome on the packaging of the commemorative ""Ice Age"" Pop-Tarts. But thats as far as the comparisons will go unless ""Cars"" takes a wrong turn this June and gets totaled. If the Pixar crew grew up worshiping classic Disney films the Blue Sky team is definitely more partial to the Coyote and Roadrunner cartoons. ""The Meltdown"" is less a story than a series of complicated slapstick bits -- the physical gags are often enjoyable but theres not much else to the movie. Director Carlos Saldanha could have randomly shuffled his storyboards and the finished product would be about the same. This edition focuses on Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) and his relationship issues. Environmental changes force his crew from the first film to migrate and Manny must face his loneliness cautiousness and ultimately his dormant sexuality -- especially after he meets a female mammoth (Queen Latifah) named Ellie who may be the only member of his species left on the planet. (Yes ""Basic Instinct 2"" will be the sequel this weekend with the most sex talk in it but the competition is closer than you think.) Making matters more complicated Ellie thinks shes an opossum and hangs out with a pair of troublemaking characters who seem to be auditioning for the next ""Jackass"" movie. The language and content of ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" arent really a problem as long as parents know what theyre getting into. There are a few words in this film that I cant even use in this review -- because The Chronicles style is stricter than Blue Skys. ""Do we have to bring this crap?"" one dung beetle asks another as they push some feces up a hill. ""Im sure theres crap where were going."" That was probably the funniest line from writers who seem happier knocking the audience over the head than dealing with language subtleties. Much of that broad comic relief comes from John Leguizamo as Sid the Sloth (sort of a Barney Fife type with Donald Ducks speech patterns) and the long-suffering rodent Scrat whose epic journey to collect a nut is easily the most entertaining part of the film -- and has nothing to do with the plot. Denis Leary also returns to voice Diego the saber-toothed tiger although its not clear why. In the pantheon of TV and movie characters with nothing to do he falls just ahead of Jai from ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" and Halle Berrys Storm character from ""X-Men"" and just behind the black Ghostbuster played by Ernie Hudson. Diego would be the scariest thing in the film except hes one of the good guys and barely gets to show his fangs. Like everything else in ""Ice Age"" he just kind of lumbers along. -- Advisory This movie contains adult language a few small scares and some apocalyptic environmental themes -- which are scarier than ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but not quite as frightening as the Bible.

But Ice Age The Meltdown is so much more. For a few tortured souls embarking on the journey of their lives it is a voyage of discovery. It boasts characters in denial dogged by repressed memories and unresolved grief. It features animals in need of Freudian psychotherapy or swimming lessons possibly both. When a woolly mammoth confesses ""Deep down I knew I was different"" we feel her pain. This particular woolly mammoth -- Ellie warmly voiced by Queen Latifah -- does have problems. Orphaned in babyhood she was reared by kindhearted opossums and is a touch genus-confused believing she too was born to play dead. But Ellies a well-adjusted pachyderm compared to fellow mammoth Manny (Ray Romano doing his best sad sack) who grieves for the loss of his family and refuses to acknowledge the impending extinction of the species. Also in distress are Sid the Sloth (sibilantly spat by John Leguizamo) a three-toed Rodney Dangerfield in search of respect and Diego (natural growler Denis Leary) a saber-tooth tiger and recalcitrant aquaphobe. Only slightly less moody are a squirrel with symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and a pair of mischievous opossum brothers (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck) who while cheerful seem inordinately bent on killing themselves. Deluded mammoth grieving mammoth phobic cat self-loathing sloth obsessive rodent and arguably suicidal opossums a self-help group for the (ice) ages. Shrewd movie goers will recognize several characters from 2002s original Ice Age whose triumvirate of Manny Sid and Diego (plus the mad squirrel) rescued a gurgling human baby from the jaws of Diegos more carnivorous colleagues. Ice Age The Meltdown crosses familiar territory but does so with exceeding sweetness and no shortage of visual imagination bolstering what is in essence a fairly simplistic road movie with an eco-conscious twist. Nothing much happens aside from yawn global warming and catastrophic floods. Basically the Big Three are on the fly from the advertised meltdown when they run into Ellie and her opossum compatriots giving Ellie and Manny a chance to meet (wink wink species survival? wink wink) and resolve their issues. The other animals too have emotional breakthroughs -- Sid winds up kidnapped by a tribe of reverent minisloths -- as they plod toward higher ground dodging icebergs teetering on cliffs avoiding a pair of beastly amphibians thawed from a hunk of ice. Especially charming is a chorus of vultures singing Food Glorious Food rejiggered from Oliver to accommodate a taste for carrion. Ice Age The Meltdown provides no startling cinematic innovations but the animation (Foxs) is brightly rendered and zoomily kinetic in the manner of director Carlos Saldanhas other work (as co-director of Ice Age and Robots). I was charmed and my kindergartner laughed from start to finish. The finish is best of all -- a riff on the recurring theme of squirrel and acorn with metaphysical overtones.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The ""Ice Age"" movie franchise is in reality a fantastic short film stretched by a couple of hours of filler. Scrat the acorn-obsessed squirrel rat was the true charm of the 2002 original ""Ice Age."" Yes Ray Romano nicely transferred his sitcom persona to a woolly mammoth and John Leguizamo brought his voice talents to Sid the sloth. But it was Scrat who began in a short film and whose antics were scattered throughout the first ""Ice Age"" who made audiences laugh in hysterical sympathy. Lets say glaciers did cover most of the planet - wouldnt we all struggle as comically and maniacally as poor Scrat to scrape one last acorn out of the permafrost? With his googly eyes and suicidal lack of self-regard the wordless Scrat of a thousand desperate grunts was an animated Marty Feldman. Now comes the sequel ""Ice Age 2 The Meltdown"" and the more things thaw the more they stay the same. Romano and Leguizamo are back Denis Leary returns as sensitive saber-tooth Diego. Manny the mammoth even has a potential love interest voiced by Queen Latifah. And yet its all just so much stuffing for the snowman. Scrat is back in all his hopeless glory climbing his own tongue hand over hand plugging holes in ice dams using his teeth like a glass cutter - anything to attack another acorn. Since many of us in the audience are turning our attention along with the ""Ice Age"" gang to global warming Scrat is a hero for our time. Single-minded task-oriented a bit mangy he scratches bites and drools as a proxy for all humankind. OK thats a bit much to hang on any one squirrel-rat. But filmmakers Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha understand what worked to make the first ""Ice Age"" such a hit and they stick with it here. The glorious and treacherous world of snow they built for ""Ice Age"" is coming apart. Our main characters live in a valley below a towering ice dam. While prehistoric penguins turtles and bears play in the melting snow as if it were Jurassic Water Park Manny Sid and Diego climb the ice cliff to discover stark reality. A sea of water waits behind the dam; when warmer weather opens the glacier the valley is doomed. A couple of voracious reptiles meanwhile lurk in the waters crisscrossing the snowbound valley. These new inventions are rendered in brilliant computer animation leaping and hissing through water and air. As the fleeing animals confront the villainous reptiles ""Ice Age 2"" becomes a mash-up of ""Exodus"" and ""Jaws."" Like all good animations aimed at 6-year-olds ""Meltdown"" poses teachable moments for each of our main characters. Sid the butt of all jokes wants respect. Diego afraid of the water wants courage. Manny who fears his species is going extinct wants a date. Enter Latifah as Ellie a mammoth who was raised by possums and thinks she should hang her 5-ton frame upside down from trees. Long-suffering Manny must be patient in pulling the wool from her eyes. Wedges and Saldanha co-directed the first installment and Saldanha takes over for ""Meltdown."" He shows an agreeable touch at key moments especially given the nonstop jabbering that clutters most animated films these days. The moment Ellie realizes shes a mammoth is filled with refreshing quiet. The silence is eventually broken with a good joke as she warns a romantic Manny ""Youre not saving the species tonight or any other night."" The ""Ice Age 2"" writing crew stacks up a load of allusions like so many ice blocks. Some work some collapse. The animals eventually head for a huge tree trunk that will float them to safety mixing Ark mythology with Adam and Eve connotations. Vultures chasing the weary exodus break into a rendition of ""Food Glorious Food"" and while its a good musical number we puzzle over this ""Oliver"" twist. Scrat is terribly useful at such moments. If the rest of ""Meltdown"" is a three-star movie Scrat brings four stars every time. Perhaps by the next sequel theyll dispense with the filler and give Scrat his own movie. Hes a hero for any age.

"Ice Age sequel offers familiar fun - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies REVIEW Ice Age sequel offers familiar fun By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  March 31 2006 If a Pixar movie represents the four-star cuisine of computer-generated family entertainment and DreamWorks Animation offers hip fusion meals such as Shrek"" and Shark Tale"" then the films that come out of 20th Century Foxs CGI wing -- Ice Age"" Robots"" -- are franks n beans by comparison. Theyre comfortable and filling (if mildly gassy) and artistry isnt on the menu.Which is to say that Ice Age The Meltdown"" is pure sequel product that should make children and undemanding grown-ups happy even as it lacks anything resembling storytelling inspiration. Anyone inclined to take the longer view may scratch his head and wonder why a kiddie movie is the only place our culture is willing to talk about global warming.Yep meteorological apocalypse is the dramatic engine of Meltdown"" (are you ready for your Happy Meal?). The glaciers are retreating oceans are breaking out everywhere and all the baroque Pleistocene critters are rushing for the safety of a giant tree trunk ark"" before a massive ice dam bursts and floods their valley.Amid the glyptodonts aurochs and giant anteaters are a few familiar faces Manny the mammoth (voice of Ray Romano) Sid the giant sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary). (Unlike in the first Ice Age"" Paleolithic man is nowhere in evidence; presumably he has already made it to high ground.) These three form their own pack although Manny is morose over the fact that hes probably the last of his kind.Scratch that Another mammoth appears in the form of Ellie (Queen Latifah) a high-spirited pachyderm convinced shes actually an opossum. The ugly marsupial"" subplot extends to Ellies romping blithely through the trees with her two adopted possum brothers Crash (Seann William Scott who played Stifler in the American Pie"" movies) and Eddie (Josh Peck from Nickelodeons Drake and Josh""). These two come on like meerkats with attention-deficit disorder and are the second-funniest things in the movie.The funniest -- by a long shot -- is Scrat the prehistoric squirrel whose silent increasingly desperate attempts to retrieve a precious acorn are dropped into the movie like Road Runner"" shorts into a Cecil B. DeMille epic. Pared down to the bone of comic cause and hilarious effect the Scrat sequences show off what mainstream CGI is capable of at its best an unbeatable combination of hyper-realistic textures and crack Looney Tunes timing.Elsewhere Ice Age The Meltdown"" plods along with the heavy familiarity of Manny himself introducing two thawed-out aquatic beasties to nip scarily at the heels of the heroes as they encounter one near-death experience after another. The saber-toothed tiger has to overcome his fear of water. Sid has to overcome his native stupidity -- no easy task -- and cope with a worshipful horde of miniature sloths whove apparently wandered over from Madagascar.""Manny meanwhile has to convince Ellie shes a mammoth for the greater good of the species and only the geniality of Romano and Queen Latifah keep this plotline from devolving into an especially gooey episode of The Bachelor."" Along with a crowd of cameo fauna -- Jay Leno as a fast-talking tortoise Stephen Root as an aardvark Will Arnett of Arrested Development"" as a vulture -- they all move toward a climax of nearly biblical proportions only to see the world saved by a tiny yet consequential act.Well its a kids movie; of course its going to deal with climate change in a manner thats literally nuts. Ice Age The Meltdown"" raises a gnarly topical issue only to soothe it away and you may wonder why the filmmakers brought it up in the first place. At least the script goes easy on the overbearing pop cross-references that bogged down Shark Tale"" and Chicken Little"" and the Scrat sequences are close to genius. My kids liked the movie better than the first one"" and yours will probably play the DVD until the laser rots out of the player. Thats what the studio is counting on. After the first spin you wont even need to be in the room. After the third neither will they.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Meltdown is one for the ages -- all ages By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Ice Age The Meltdown should warm viewers hearts globally. Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) go along for the ride with mammoth Manny (Ray Romano). Blue Sky Studios With its appealing combination of humor and endearing characters -- many of whom are back from the first film -- it is at least as good as the original Ice Age and possibly better. The amusing and dogged efforts of Scrat the prehistoric squirrel and his ever-elusive acorn are woven into this movies plot in an even more humorous way than in the first film. The days of the Ice Age are numbered spelling impending doom for the civilization of animals living in its midst. Manny the Eeyore-like woolly mammoth (voiced with a perfect sad-sack quality by Ray Romano) joins forces with his pals Sid the undervalued but perceptive sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego (Denis Leary) the fierce and sardonic saber-tooth tiger who harbors secret fears of water. About the movieIce Age The Meltdown     (out of four) Director Carlos Saldanha Voices Ray Romano Queen Latifah John Leguizamo Denis Leary Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for some mild language and innuendo Running time 1 hour 30 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Rounding out this likable mix of critters is newcomer Ellie a mammoth who thinks shes a possum (voiced with just the right touch by Queen Latifah). Manny and Ellie meet cute bicker and stumble around a bit then establish some chemistry in classic romantic-comedy fashion. Before meeting Ellie Manny thought he was the last of his kind. Once he encounters her he must convince Ellie shes not a possum like her two rascally ""brothers"" Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck). Visual gags such as the hulking mammoth attempting to play possum by hanging from a tree branch by her tail are cleverly funny. The computer animation is vivid and richer thanks to strides in technology made since the 2002 film. The animal characters look distinctive and adorable. There are more laughs even if the story comes across as a continuation rather than an original venture. Parents will be pleased with the child-friendly messages about overcoming fears and obstacles banding together as a family and the value of determination and pursuing goals. As fun as it is to spend time again with the main trio the two new prankster characters Crash and Eddie almost steal the show. And the vulture who direly predicts a flood is a hoot as an ominous naysayer. Adventure and action abound as creatures contend with cracking ice and perilous rushing water while they make their exodus out of the valley to higher ground. Ice Age The Meltdown succeeds on several fronts most of them warm and fuzzy. But it doesnt venture into corny or sickly sweet terrain. Its an enjoyable comedy adventure that will appeal to all ages.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor March 31 2006 Save for later Saved I enjoyed the computer-animated ""Ice Age"" and its sequel ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" is just about as good. Sequels are usually made for no other reason than commercial expediency but I remember thinking when I saw the first film that I wouldnt mind spending more time with Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) Manny the woolly mammoth (Ray Romano) Diego the saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) and especially the prehistoric squirrel Scrat. Most sequels in essence are family reunions so it helps if you like the family.In ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" the welcomed warming of the climate has resulted in an unfortunate consequence A glacial dam holding back oceans of water is threatening to break and flood the valley. A vast exodus to the drier end of the valley is begun with vultures hovering in the air and a pair of newly unfrozen alligatorish marauders darting for prey below the ice.This time Diego is more intricately computer-drawn and less volatile. It turns out he has a fear of water. (Hes like a straight-faced blood brother to the Cowardly Lion from Oz.) Diego is the most realistic and therefore the least interesting of the critters. Sid the sloth with his purple nose and lisp is much livelier and funnier. He reaches his apotheosis when he accidentally finds himself in the company of a village of sloths who believe him to be a fire god. They become a squirmy mass of hysterical worshipers. This part is like a rodent takeoff on ""The Man Who Would Be King."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Things drag a bit whenever Manny is around. Maybe its because unlike so many of the other creatures Manny moves slowly and ponderously. He couldnt have been much fun to animate and his dialogue is often ponderous too. It doesnt help if your ear is attuned to hearing Romano in ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" You keep expecting Doris Roberts and Peter Boyle to turn up as armadillos. As Mannys newfound love interest Ellie a woolly mammoth who thinks shes a possum Queen Latifahs voice work is even more jarring. She cant be anything but Queen Latifah. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The overall look of this second film is cooler and crisper than the first. CGI animation has now almost entirely replaced hand-drawn animation for features and with each passing year the technology improves. The detailing of the characters and their environment here is extremely well worked out - not on a Pixar level but good enough. (Pixars movies are also much better in the script department.)Nevertheless I continue to bemoan the demise of hand-drawn animation which is almost single-handedly being kept alive by Hayao Miyazaki the genius behind ""Spirited Away"" and ""Howls Moving Castle."" As far as Hollywood goes that technique is a lost cause. Movies like ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" at least take advantage of the physical flexibility that can be rendered so well in CGI. The creatures are amusingly shape-shifty.The best parts of the film as in the original are the sequences with Scrat squeaking and scrambling after an elusive acorn. This CGI Sisyphus is a triumphant creation and he deserves his own film.One more thing So many movies these days are being linked often quite tenuously to current politics. Let this new film be no exception. I am happy to say that ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" points up for toddlers the dangers of global warming. Grade B+ Rated PG for some mild language and innuendo.

"Ice Age 2 A Tepid Meltdown washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Ice Age 2 A Tepid Meltdown Manny the woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) gets some news from Fast Tony (Jay Leno) in the well-animated but still-lifeless sequel. (20Th Century Fox Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 31 2006 The most endearing character in ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" is Scrats acorn. Okay it -- he? -- has no lines no personality no cute cuddly face and doesnt sing or dance. But commendably this little critter fights like hell to stay out of Scrats maw. Its not about to give anything up for Scrat who appears to be some kind of saber-toothed squirrel and it doesnt care that Scrat is represented by ICM drives a super-yellow Hummer and has been seen dating Mischa Barton. And the more Scrat struggles to consume much less capture the little devil-nut the more Mr. Acorn manages to bound away in this direction or that while all around the world seems to be ending. Really the mime struggle between Scrat and nut is far and away the most amusing few minutes in ""Ice Age The Meltdown."" It recalls a grand tradition in movies from the brilliant Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote cartoons of Chuck Jones to the silent maestros Charlie Chaplin Laurel and Hardy and Harold Lloyd. It demonstrates how much joy and communication can be found in pure movement as Scrat driven ever further by desperation twists into balletic dislocations of time space and gravity to snare Mr. Acorn but the little nugget of protein seems always to find an avenue of escape. I say Go nut go Alas the rest of the time nothing nearly as interesting transpires. One can be grateful that despite the ominous ""Meltdown"" behind the colon the sequel to 2002s ""Ice Age"" doesnt turn into an anti-global warming screed and there are no cartoon exaggerations of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as ignorant Neanderthals batted around. Rather the film stays largely with the odd selection of creatures that dominated the 2002 hit -- a sloth named Sid (the voice of John Leguizamo) a mammoth named Manny (Ray Romano) and a saber-toothed tiger named Diego (Denis Leary). A romantic interest is added with Ellie another mammoth (Queen Latifah). Notice a pattern? Well the linguistic conceit of the film is that the Ice Age vocal patterns reflect the harsh yammer of the New York streets. Are we in the Pleistocene or on 42nd and Broadway in the 30s? Whos writing this Damon Runyon? (Leary the outsider as a Bostonian hardly registers.) Those of you who dont find New York Citys rhythms soothing are strictly out of luck. Although Romano is by nature a slow adenoidal talker the piece is driven forward mainly by Leguizamos yappy sloth whos given so many lines he becomes tiresome. The plot -- perhaps ""plot-like arrangement of discrete arbitrary events"" would be more accurate -- follows as the happy creatures of some kind of utopian bestiary smell the coffee one warm day and realize that the snows getting softer the days longer the sun hotter. Is this ""spring"" or ""the end of the world?"" Concluding its the latter they begin a migration toward the end of the valley where a huge felled tree will serve as a kind of Ark substitute and let them ride out the ensuing flood. The movie consciously repeats heavily faith-based imagery of animals two by two queuing up to get aboard but as a modern document it has absolutely no interest in suggestions of a supreme being. According to its cosmology the only supreme being is the mammoth because hes so big Mild adventures occur during the trek Two underwater lizards from another age sprung from the ice just like ""The Beast from 20000 Fathoms"" in the Jurassic of the 50s ride the newly amplified riverine system in an attempt to snap up an hors doeuvre or two. These coldblooded beasties didnt get the memo that universal peace on Earth had broken out. Another thing that seems on the verge of breaking out is a musical. Now and then but without any consistency the film conjures up big production numbers. Maybe seeing vultures do a passable imitation of Busby Berkeley is worth your money; its the best single sequence in the film. See the singin dancin vultures before they feast on carrion The animation is first-rate particularly as the 20th Century Fox technicians have mastered the incredible difficulty of capturing the sheen of moving water the undulations of light on a liquid surface the atomization of a single droplet as it shears upward. Amazing. But the story needs to catch up to the magic. Otherwise whats the point? Ice Age The Meltdown (89 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for the intense innuendo of worlds end.

"Ice Age The Meltdown | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ice-age-the-meltdown ) Ice Age The Meltdown (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Despite its popularity with children Ice Age represented at the time a nadir for digital animation. Although entertaining the film couldnt stand toe-to-toe with its Pixar and Dreamworks competitors. Ice Age The Meltdown represents a further step backwards. Although the animation has improved the regression is keenly felt in other areas - particularly the story. This is a lackluster film that exists exclusively because its predecessor made money. Thankfully the best character from the original Ice Age the sabertooth squirrel is back. This time his role is expanded to give him an extra four or five minutes of screen time. The producers recognizing his popularity have accorded him a half-dozen comedic episodes in his never-ending quest to capture an elusive acorn. Not since Wiley Coyote has a character been so brutalized in his foiled attempts to obtain dinner. Its through these interludes that one feels the animators channeling the spirit of Chuck Jones. The character deserves to star in his own series of shorts rather than be lumped in with the unremarkable entities populating Ice Age The Meltdown. The three principals have returned from Ice Age - Manny the Woolly Mammoth (voice of Ray Romano) Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabertooth Tiger (Denis Leary) - although theyre trapped in a movie with almost no plot. For this installment they are joined by Ellie the Mammoth (Queen Latifa) who might represent Mannys chance to repopulate his species if she can be convinced that shes not a possum. Also along for the ride are Ellies ""brothers"" possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck). Theyre all on a pilgrimage to high ground since global warming is about to cause the collapse of an ice dam that will result in a massive flood. Ice Age The Meltdown has its share of humorous moments but most of these involve the squirrel. The main plot involving the exodus and the Mammoth romance is more often dull than amusing. This is a problem because no motion picture can be entirely successful when secondary characters and storylines trump the primary ones. However the reality is that when people think of the Ice Age movies the squirrel comes to mind. We need more of him and less of the laconic Manny and his uninspired sidekicks. The films director is Carlos Saldanha who co-directed two other Fox animated features Ice Age and Robots. One improvement he makes to this sequel is to improve its look. The characters and settings are still a little blocky and lack the visual grace of efforts like Finding Nemo and Shrek but they are improved. Technically Ice Age is adequate although thats an improvement over most of the digitally animated films of the past year. Kids - the distributors target market - dont care much about this however. Ice Age The Meltdown delivers the kind of cinematic package they expect cute animals funny moments and cartoonish action sequences. With the bar set so high by Pixar and Dreamworks adults have come to expect more from animated films than Ice Age The Meltdown delivers.

It could happen. In providing the voice of a playful full-figured gal with luscious eyelashes (maybe its Maybelline?) and curvaceous tusks who long story short happens to think shes a possum the Queen gracefully transfers her distinctive charms to one of the new principal characters who join the herd for this jaunty sequel to the popular 2002 CG family comedy. And her outgoing feminine touch sharpens the game of the boys around her -- as well as the wits of the Ice Age writers. Ellies arrival on the Pleistocene scene along with her two rambunctious real-possum ""brothers"" Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) coincides with an emergency migration under way for the gloomy self-aware woolly mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) the snobby saber-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and the sloth with self-esteem problems Sid (John Leguizamo) The Ice Age is ending the glaciers are melting and death by drowning is a distinct possibility. (Enlightened statement about global warming? Nah this perky escapade says life is good once you get past a little water.) Anyhow just as in Michael Bays Armageddon whats a cataclysmic world event compared with personal growth? Until he meets Ellie Manny mopes because he thinks hes the last of his species (and even after his pals assure him that ""she completes you"" Mannys a pessimist). Sid looking for respect gets more than he bargains for in some marvelous mayhem with a species of mini-sloths. Diego is forced to admit weakness. And the tenacious prehistoric squirrel-rat thing called Scrat who ran away with the first picture is back to steal the second still obsessed with his nuts. There will be time after Manny and Ellie rub fur to worry about the fragile planet. Ice Age The Meltdown blithely looks on the bright side of life amassing a screen full of vultures to sing and dance ""Food Glorious Food"" and daring us not to get happy.
