The film tells the story of two junior-high outcasts but nothing in their friendship seems to have any connection to real experience; its all sticky and contrived only-in-the-movies claptrap. Maxwell (Elden Henson) who sports a buzz cut and a face full of fear is a morose hulk of an underachiever who looks like a teen version of Vincent DOnofrios Private Pyle in Full Metal Jacket. Kevin (Kieran Culkin) his opposite number is a shrimpy ebullient whiz kid who hobbles around on a pair of Tiny Tim crutches the victim of a rare degenerative medical condition. Stationing himself atop the bigger boys shoulders (just like Master-Blaster in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome) Kevin becomes the brain to Maxwells brawn. Together they fight off local punks engage in such knightly ""quests"" as rescuing a womans purse from a sewer and finally face tests of fortitude (evil dad sprung from prison etc.) that exist only in badly plotted sentimental melodramas. Culkin is just cloying and precocious enough to make you long for his brother Macaulays restraint and Sharon Stone as Kevins mom does almost too perfect a job of projecting respectability and ""goodness."" You forget she was ever a sex goddess -- or for that matter a charismatic actress.

Movies by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Posted January 8 1999 -- 1200 AM EST Hes nifty to look at. Huge but not quite humungous with giant bulgy limbs and a back so long and jutting it looks like something youd want to ride a skateboard off the title beast of Mighty Joe Young is undeniably a special-effects marvel. He doesnt just look like an actual gorilla. He moves like one so that when hes galloping in a rage across a grassy plain swiping his hand at a vehicle hes trying to outrun you feel youre seeing a creature whos fantastic yet real. Of course what youre actually watching is animatronic puppetry computer-generated imagery and -- that old fave -- a man in an ape suit but the seamless merging of special effects is a marvel to behold. Neat as Joe looks you do wish that someone had bothered to give him a personality. Mighty Joe Young a remake of the 1949 sentimental monster melodrama (in essence King Kong with a smaller oversize gorilla) is a showcase for the imagination of visual effects wizard Rick Baker but the script is very bland monkey business indeed. Raised in a jungle outside an African village where he has formed a lifelong friendship with Jill (Charlize Theron) a kind of amateur babelicious Jane Goodall Joe is threatened by the same evil poachers who killed his mother. He is taken to the safety of a California animal conservancy and once there put on display as a way to lure funding. (Is there a movie of the late 90s that isnt about finance?) The poachers find him anyway of course. Its up to Jill and Gregg (Bill Paxton) the zoologist she has been flirting with to take action. No more cages No more wildlife preserves Free Mighty Joe Young Free him so that he can bust out and go wild on Hollywood Boulevard If Mighty Joe Young werent so predictable it might have been grade-B fun. As it is even Jills ""bond"" with Joe is an erotic joke that never hatches. In one year alone Charlize Theron has had to make goo-goo eyes at both a giant ape and Kenneth Branagh channeling Woody Allen. Its time she was matched up with some higher primates.

Disneys new version of the 1949 RKO film about an oversized African gorilla out of his element in urban America makes the most of modern technology adding color computer graphics and impressive animatronics to a rather predictable storyline. ""Mighty Joe Young"" is wholesome well-crafted family fare like Hollywood used to make. Disneys new version of the 1949 RKO film about an oversized African gorilla out of his element in urban America makes the most of modern technology adding color computer graphics and impressive animatronics to a rather predictable storyline. Positioned as the major live-action family adventure of the season ""Mighty Joe"" ought to have no trouble finding its footing. If the story of a kindly 15-foot ape struggling to find his place in a modern world feels like an anachronism its because films of the last few years have seen a succession of giant destructive forces attacking the planet ranging from gargantuan lizards to aliens and asteroids. ""Mighty Joe Young"" by contrast pits a well-meaning gorilla against the evil human forces of greed and exploitation. Scientist Dr. Ruth Young (Linda Purl) and her young daughter Jill (Mika Boorem) are studying the behavior of a family of apes in Tanzania. Among the gorillas is young Joe whose rare genetic mutation makes him grow faster than his peers. Playing up the innocence and harmony of a natural world at peace the early scenes make a fitting counterpoint to the violence and devastation that ensue when deadly poachers arrive on the scene. Leading the pack of poachers is the evil Strasser (Rade Sherbedgia) who plans to snatch the baby gorilla for sale on the black market. When the poachers kill Joes mother Ruth steps into the line of fire. Suffering a fatal wound Ruth tells her daughter to protect Joe. Having both been orphaned on the same night the girl and the baby gorilla have only each other. The most disturbing sequence of the film the double killing might be too upsetting for young viewers. Years pass and the adult Jill (Charlize Theron) and Joe live in peace and seclusion on their mountain. Joe has become local folklore and few believe that he actually exists until scientist Gregg OHara (Bill Paxton) arrives and in the course of his research stumbles onto evidence of Joe. Word spreads quickly and Greggs discovery inadvertently prompts the poachers return. Believing Joe is no longer safe on the mountain Gregg persuades a reluctant Jill to move the gorilla to a California wildlife preserve where she will remain Joes caretaker. Despite the efforts of the preserves director Dr. Harry Ruben (David Paymer) and assistant Cicily Banks (Regina King) Joe faces a rocky transition to his ridiculously small man-made digs. News of the apes arrival has reached Strasser who has not forgotten the baby gorilla that got away. Posing as a benefactor of the preserve Strasser plans to convince Jill that he can give Joe a better life in his own South American ""preserve"" - really a front for black market trading in endangered animals. When Joe loses his temper and wreaks havoc on a black-tie benefit preserve chairman Dr. Baker (Lawrence Pressman) has the ape sedated and incarcerated. Trusting Strassers invitation Jill arranges for a truck to take Joe away. But Jill soon realizes Strasser has set her up. Fighting him off she engineers a traffic accident that enables Joe to escape setting off a chaotic series of events in which Joe roams through Hollywood inadvertently terrorizing dumbstruck throngs. The final third of the film is its most far-fetched but also features its most entertaining use of local landmarks and frequently funniest scenes. Its also the movies best demonstration of the capacities of computer animation and animatronics engineering. Impressively Joe scales the spire of the Chinese Theater giving the venue its best movie role since ""Blazing Saddles."" He briefly hides behind the Hollywood sign and cleverly clings to a freeway underpass to elude police helicopters. The climactic chase winds up at a carnival and in one of the films most emotionally manipulative yet undeniably effective moments Joe performs a feat of heroism and self-sacrifice that may leave him for dead. Theres not a lot to be said for the acting since the humans play second banana to the gorilla throughout. However the leggy Theron emotes well on cue especially given that shes often acting opposite a blue screen or mechanized arm. Paxton brandishes the same scientists self-assured swagger he trotted out in ""Twister."" And Sherbedgia does a variation on the over-arch villain he portrayed in ""The Saint."" Technical credits and production values are fine with kudos to Hoyt Yeatmans visual effects and Rick Bakers realistically designed Joe; Baker is Hollywoods gorilla meister par excellence having created primates for ""Gorillas in the Mist"" and ""Greystoke The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes."" Don Peterman and Oliver Woods lensing sparkles. And James Horner whose music for another oversized creation ""Titanic"" brought him two Oscars brings effective pathos and grandeur to the proceedings.

"Mighty Joe Young | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mighty-joe-young ) Mighty Joe Young (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli When Mighty Joe Young first reached screens in 1949 nearly everyone recognized it as an attempt to re-create the magic and mystique of King Kong. Many of the same people were involved -- Ernest B. Schoedsack in the directors chair Robert Armstrong (Carl Denham in Kong Max OHara in Joe Young) in a leading role a story by Merian C. Cooper stop-motion animation by Willis OBrien -- but lightning didnt strike twice. Mighty Joe Young received a lukewarm reception when it was first released and years later few would label this particular monster movie a ""classic."" Disneys 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young puts both the special effects and the storyline through an upgrade. The basic premise -- a giant gorilla is taken out of his natural habitat and brought to civilization where he runs amok -- is the same (and not coincidentally the same as for King Kong) but many of the details have changed. Also because this is a Disney release and designed to be suitable for children it is ""family friendly"" (not that the original wasnt). With one necessary exception nothing truly terrible happens to any of the characters except (of course) the bad guys. Director Ron Underwood (Tremors) and screenwriters Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner (Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country) have modernized Mighty Joe Young bringing it out of the 40s and into the 90s while grafting a few obvious elements of Dino DeLaurentiis 1976 King Kong remake onto the proceedings and tacking on an ending right out of Its a Wonderful Life. The story begins in Africa during the mid-1980s when Jill Young (Mika Boorem) loses her mother (Linda Purl) to a gunshot fired by a ruthless big-game hunter Strasser (Rade Sherbedgia). Strasser is a major player in the black market selling of endangered species and he has come to Jills part of Africa in search of new inventory. Another of his bullets finds a female gorilla the mother of Jills simian friend Joe. Bonded by their mutual orphanage the two become inseparable as they grow up together. But Joe is no ordinary gorilla -- by the time he reaches adulthood hes 15 feet tall and weighs 2000 pounds. The next time we meet Joe and Jill (now played by Charlize Theron) its 12 years later. Poachers are threatening Joes existence and Gregg OHara (Bill Paxton) an adventurous zoologist who works for the California Animal Conservatory has arrived with an offer of sanctuary for Joe if Jill is willing to bring him to a preserve in America. Reluctantly she agrees. Soon Joe is acclimating to his new home but all is not well. The Conservatory anxious to use their new attraction as a fund-raising tool has put Joe in the media spotlight and Strasser is eager to capture him. Eventually and inevitably Joe escapes from the preserve and begins romping around Hollywood. Plot-wise theres not much going on here. Mighty Joe Young is like a low-rent King Kong with a little more emphasis on the humanity of the primate. In fact a great deal of effort is undertaken to make Joe a likable character (as opposed to a walking special effect a la Godzilla) -- he is shown to be intelligent childlike and gentle (except when provoked). The movie contains elements of comedy and romance (between Gregg and Jill although Joe is jealous) but the silliest aspects of the original have been eliminated. Joe is a masterpiece of special effects wizardry looking more real than any giant primate ever to walk across the silver screen. By combining animatronics computer-generated images and a man in a costume Mighty Joe Young creates a compelling illusion. Hollywood monkeyman Rick Baker (who was responsible for among others the ape in the 76 King Kong and the gorillas in Gorillas in the Mist) is in top form here and hes helped out by actors who dont have difficulty performing opposite a giant puppet or an ""X"" on the floor. As the human leads Mighty Joe Young features one established actor and one rising star. Bill Paxton who has already been in a quintet of box office blockbusters (Aliens True Lies Apollo 13 Twister Titanic) brings his affable personality to this movie in a try for number six. Opposite Paxton is blond bombshell Charlize Theron who is best remembered for her part in Two Days in the Valley (her feature debut) and who recently appeared in Woody Allens Celebrity. Its in large part because of Paxton and Therons performances that we accept Joe as more than a clever construct of modern technology. The villain Strasser is Rade Sherbedgia (also known as Rade Serbedzija) who played a similarly nasty character in The Saint. Actually his role here is superfluous. Theres enough going on in Mighty Joe Young that the addition of a traditional villain is unnecessary (there was none in the original). Nevertheless since Disney wanted a clearly-defined bad guy some actor had to be stuck with the thankless role and its Sherbedgia. Supporting cast members include David Paymer (Oscar nominated for Mr. Saturday Night) as the lead scientist at the Conservatory Regina King (Jerry Maguire) as his assistant and Peter Firth (Dr. Craig in Shadowlands) as Strassers sidekick. Ray Harryhausen (the legendary stop-motion animator who worked with Willis OBrien on the original Mighty Joe) and Terry Moore (who played Jill in 1949) both have cameos during a black-tie dinner sequence. The marketing campaign surrounding Mighty Joe Young has been interesting. Originally when the film was planned for a summer release it was being touted as a monster movie. Wary of Godzilla however Disney shifted Mighty Joe Youngs opening to the end of the year and after Godzilla tanked the Magic Kingdom began advertising their film as family-suitable fare by playing up the cute aspects. Although Joes size makes him a monster his disposition makes him cuddly. Despite not being daring in style or story Mighty Joe Young is nevertheless a charming and enjoyable adventure and a rare remake thats better than the original. It may not have the box office punch to exceed the 100 million mark but its good enough to entertain an audience.

Starring Bill Paxton and Charlize Theron. Directed by Ron Underwood. (PG. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Mighty Joe Young"" is a mighty fun movie. The trick? They didnt try to out-monster those bloated King Kong and Godzilla franchises. But its still a hoot of an adventure about an overgrown ape having trouble adjusting to life in California. The 1990s blockbuster movie style calls for mass destruction and doomsday. But the makers of ""Mighty Joe Young"" wisely thought the better of that -- their big ape has plausible proportions and an almost human warmth and just wants to be left alone in nature. Hes powerful yet a bit forlorn. Opening today ""Mighty Joe Young"" is an accomplished remake of a 1949 film starring Terry Moore and Ben Johnson that was also fun (visual effects were by Willis OBrien and his then-assistant Ray Harryhausen). Blatantly old-fashioned but skillfully high-tech the new edition stars Bill Paxton as macho zoologist Gregg OHara and Charlize Theron (""That Thing You Do"") as Jill Young ape lover and friend to big Joe since his infancy in central Africa. The story is punctuated by tender moments. A subtext involving the spirited blond heroine and the ape -- while the heartsick zoologist watches with envy -- is a real tickle but its done with admirable restraint. With not much more than vibrant sincerity and a winning smile Theron turns her Jill into one of the sexiest screen femmes of the year. ""Mighty Joe Young"" has marvelous special effects. The black furry clump of a beast fleet of foot and sometimes standing almost erect is a model of seamless computer graphics and animatronics. He looks real and fake at the same time. The duality goes to the heart of the film -- Joe is a bit of a fantasy like a gigantic stuffed toy but hes also a cruel trick of nature. The more you stare at him the more the blurring of real and fake becomes a crazy fascination. We meet Jill as a little girl witnessing her mothers death at the hands of poachers outside a jungle research camp. The killing is beastly to be sure and the films most repellent moment for very young viewers. The main poacher is the ruthless Strasser (Rade Serbedzija) and Joe then a toddler bites off the villains trigger finger. Moving ahead in time a grown- up Jill has become Joes custodian. Shes able to communicate with him and even play hide-and-seek and hes essentially her jungle pal. They are two orphans bonding. But the threat of poachers and of intrusive tourists is ever-present. The fearless OHara stumbles upon the freak ape and when poachers return he talks Jill into moving the big lug to a California wildlife sanctuary. Joe arrives in Los Angeles gets stuck in freeway traffic escapes when his big rig overturns and scrambles past the famed Hollywood sign but is finally sedated for the trip to his new home. Needless to say he doesnt much care for his antiseptic lodgings there. Beautifully composed scenes show Joe scaling Manns historic Chinese Theater while throngs gawk running from a squad of police helicopters and using a freeway overpass as cover against their tranquilizer darts. In another spectacular sequence Joe climbs a giant amusement park Ferris wheel.
