DISNEY EnchantedStars Amy Adams Patrick Dempsey Susan Sarandon James Marsden Behind the scenes Directed by Kevin Lima from a script by Bill Kelly Playing Opens Nov. 21 throughout Orange County. CLICK HERE FOR MOVIE TIMES. Rating PG for some scary images and mild innuendo Running time 1 hour 47 minutes The quick hitIn this funny and upbeat twist on the Disney fairy tale canon a pen-and-ink princess (Amy Adams) is banished to live-action New York City where she falls into the protective arms of a hunky single-dad (Patrick Dempsey). Director Bill Kelly manages to mine the few deconstructive fairy tale gems not plundered by the aShreka franchise. Grade B Now playing in Orange County In ""Enchanted"" Amy Adams (""Junebug"") plays Giselle a pen-and-ink fairy tale princess banished to live-action New York City where she stumbles into the protective arms of a hunky single-dad (Patrick Dempsey) in the citys seedy Bowery district. Yeah I know - there are worse things that could happen to an attractive naive out-of-town kid in New York than hooking up with McDreamy from ""Greys Anatomy."" (For clarification I invite you to watch ""Midnight Cowboy."") But since ""Enchanted"" is a Disney offering and a generally fresh funny and upbeat one on at that ""worse things"" dont really enter into the picture. So deal. Naturally there a few minor conflicts to resolve before Giselle can live happily ever after in her Upper West Side ivory tower. Evicted from the magic kingdom of Andalasia by her wicked witch of a would-be stepmother (Susan Sarandon) Giselle is dutifully pursued by her betrothed Prince Edward (James Marsden from ""X-Men"") a gallant bore in tights who roves the Big Apple thrusting his sword into mass-transit vehicles and calling people ""peasant."" Ultimately Giselle must decide Does her destiny lie back in cartoonland with Edward or with a sad-eyed lawyer Robert (Dempsey) and his cute-as-a-pork-chop daughter (Rachel Covey)? Not much of a dilemma but for the girlish brand of wish-fulfillment favored by director Kevin Lima (""102 Dalmatians"") itll do. Robert has his own uncertainties. Though his interest in Giselle remains strictly altruistic until that hormonally charged moment when she traces her finger along the open collar of his bathrobe - God bless him he doesnt for a moment consider the possibility that this warbling royal songbird might be TOTALLY INSANE - Robert is still not completely sold on girlfriend Nancy (Idina Menzel from ""Rent"") a sassy Madison Avenue professional who proves remarkably tolerant of his new live-in charity case. If one was absolutely determined to find fault in ""Enchanted"" might it rest with the filmmakers tacit approval of male romantic stereotypes? Why after all would Edward want a sophisticated self-sufficient 30-something woman when he could have a perky strawberry blonde with the non-judgmental personality of an 8-year-old? Screenwriter Bill Kelly (""Blast from the Past"") leaves that one alone but does manage to mine a few deconstructive fairy tale gems not plundered by the ""Shrek"" franchise. Theres a nifty CGI chipmunk a poison-apple-wielding henchman (rat-faced character actor Timothy Spall) and a hilarious scene in which Giselle - accustomed to singalong sessions with darling forest critters - tries the same trick in New York and summons only pigeons rats and cockroaches. In ""Enchanted"" even the vermin whistle while they work.Contact the writer 800-536-3251 or couthierfreedom.com Im the header X Share with Friends Get Link Get Code BloggerMessengerFacebook TwitterGoogle BuzzMySpaceDiggAIM ShareStumbleupon Your message was successfully shared Share Again Popular Shares Post to  Message Blog URLhttp/// 140 Characters Left Cancel Submit Loading...

Highmore plays the apparently orphaned product of a one-night stand between two musicians (Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who vanished from his life the day he was born. Now August hears a symphony in every sound of New York City which he combs for signs of his departed parents. Along with a thuddingly uppercase script by Nick Castle and James V. Hart Augusts heightened sensitivity may be one reason why this Dickensian melodrama feels so over-excited in its first hour. Another is that director Kirsten Sheridan every stylized inch her father Jim Sheridans daughter treats any change in the emotional or climactic temperature as an occasion for poetic cinema. Its exhausting to watch little August fight his way to freedom and salvation abetted and hindered by an entertainingly miscast Robin Williams as a bizarre cross between Fagin and Bono in orange hair and earrings who seizes on Augusts musical talent for his own gain. Acclimate yourself to the frenzied vibe though and youll feel the movie grow into itself as an urban fairy tale whose rapturous finale stakes a wishful claim on the redemptive power of love and art. (Citywide) (Ella Taylor) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - {mosimage}PICK ENCHANTED The surprise of the season this ebullient irreverent pop musical from the Disney studios plucks a fair-skinned maiden from her 2-D animated kingdom and plunks her down in a place where ""there are no happy endings"" -- the mean live-action streets of New York City -- whereupon the disoriented Giselle (played in her 3-D incarnation by Amy Adams) is rescued by a divorced divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) who wonders if he shouldnt cart her off to Bellevue. A vain troll-slaying prince (James Marsden) and the requisite wicked stepmother/queen (Susan Sarandon) are soon to follow along with an excitable CGI chipmunk taken aback by his sudden inability to communicate intelligibly with members of the human kingdom. The sight of Adams in an impossibly billowing satin gown stranded in Lower Manhattan and seeking aid by knocking on the sequined ""castle door"" of a gaudy casino billboard offers early indication of what the screenwriter Bill Kelly and the director Kevin Lima are up to. Theyve taken their rapier wit to the vernacular of storybook fantasies (poison apples true loves kisses strokes of midnight) and to Uncle Walts storehouse of kiddie-matinee classics (the movie freely references Snow White and the Seven Dwarves Sleeping Beauty and The Little Mermaid among many others) and sent them up without violating their elemental appeal. In one scene the TV in a flophouse hotel becomes a kind of ""magic mirror""; in another the Big Apples resident fauna (pigeons cockroaches sewer rats) are subbed in for the cuter and fuzzier creatures who typically assist the beatific Giselle in the doing of her daily chores. Unlike the Shrek movies Enchanted isnt pop-culture doused and too cool for the room. The tone it strikes -- and rather miraculously maintains for nearly two hours -- is closer to Splash or Little Shop of Horrors complete with a cheeky and cheerful original song score by lyricist Stephen Schwartz and Little Shop and Little Mermaid vet Alan Menken. Its the sort of buoyant all-ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with Hairspray) but hasnt managed to get right until now and the glue holding it all together is the incomparable Adams (an Oscar nominee for 2005s Junebug) who gives the kind of blissful screwball performance that seemed to go out of fashion after I Love Lucy left the airwaves. By the time you are reading this the ads will already be proclaiming that Enchanted is ""enchanting"" and for once theyll be spot on. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas)EVERYTHINGS COOL ""Sometimes youve got to be part of the problem to be part of the solution"" intones a voice-over at the beginning of Everythings Cool Daniel B. Gold and Judith Helfands well-intentioned but glib documentary about global warming. The solution here seems to consist of driving around in a Ryder truck painted with the phrase ""G_ _B_L _ _ R_ _NG"" and asking people to fill in the blanks. This diversion sets the tone for the rest of the film which is condescending toward its audience and sorely lacking in any substantive information about the problem or the solution. The most interesting scenes by far take place at the Weather Channels Atlanta headquarters where a newly hired climatologist struggles to cram her massive expertise into soundbites -- her dismay at not being allowed to use the word ""ironic"" is pitch-perfect. But mostly we get long dreary clips of icicles melting and children playing in slushy snow that are downright manipulative Ice and snow melt every spring and highlighting micro-changes that are well within the parameters of normal variation does nothing to explain the broader problems of climate change. (Grande 4-Plex) (Julia Wallace)LE GRAND CHEF Much more likable than its inexplicable faux-French title might suggest Le Grand Chef is a heartfelt celebration of home-style Korean cuisine from the old family recipe for a homemade pepper oil to the crock pots of kimchi pickling in the backyard. A climactic sequence in which a perfectly prepared bowl of ""ordinary everyday"" sul long tang beef soup -- the ultimate Korean comfort food -- wins over the snob judges at an elite cooking competition recalls Juzo Itamis 1985 classic Tampopo in which the totem dish was an eidetic bowl of fast-food udon noodles. But in structure this film is more like The God of Cookery Stephen Chows martial arts-flavored Chinese food farce. Once again we have a young genius chef (clean-cut Kim Kang-Woo) all but expelled from the profession for a youthful screwup (a nearly fatal gaffe involving blowfish venom) who has to fight his way back to the top by defeating an underhanded rival in a high-profile cooking contest. The winner will be declared the rightful heir of the last Royal Chef of the Chosun Dynasty in effect the chef laureate of Korea. Based on the popular manhwa comic-book series Sikgaek Le Grand Chef has fun spoofing foodie fetishes and it depicts with surprising reverence the act of leading a favorite cow to its death in order to provide a perfect side of beef for the competition. (""Your sacrifice will not be in vain"") Like many current Korean hit makers director JeonYun-Su (My Girl and I) is an accomplished technician and smoothly orchestrates a large cast of conventional supporting characters including a perky TV-newscaster love interest a dorky best friend a grumpy old mentor chef and an eccentric leathery grandfather. The movie is less notable as a work of cinematic art finally than as an aperitif The restaurant owners of Koreatown should drink a toast to its arrival.

Sep. 13 600pm HITMAN Fresh from creating domestic cyber-anarchy in this summers Live Free or Die Hard Timothy Olyphant goes global as topflight international assassin Agent 47 in producer Luc Besson and director Xavier Gens bargain-basement adaptation of the titular video game. Cut loose by his Orwellian parent organization (known only as ""the organization"") following a supposedly botched hit on the Russian president 47 (who despite his jobs evident needs for anonymity and stealth sports an enormous barcode tattoo on the back of his bald head) hightails it across the former USSR in search of his betrayers while offering reluctant protection to a tempestuous prostitute (Olga Kurylenko) perplexed by the assassins paralyzing fear of intimacy. (""You dont want to fuck me and you dont want to kill me -- Ive never felt so much indifference in my life"" she huffs.) Olyphant who made for the least menacing Die Hard baddie on record here furrows his brow and snarls his lines in an unconvincing bid to seem tough. And while Gens can splatter gore with the best of them -- early in the film a human body packed with C4 goes off in graphic detail -- he fails to stage so much as a single rousing action scene even when he has four double-fisted swordsmen facing off inside an abandoned subway car. Game over. The audience loses. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas)HOLLY Shot concurrently with a ""raising awareness"" documentary on child prostitution in Southeast Asia (by the tellingly named Priority Films) Holly snatches images out of soiled Cambodian red-light districts slips figures on sex trafficking into its screenplay and numbers a reformer heroine and unrepentant pederast evildoer among its cast of characters. The titular Holly (Thuy Nguyen) is an abandoned preadolescent Vietnamese with her virginity up on the auction block; Patrick (Ron Livingston) an unmoored American expat with neither past nor future suddenly grabs onto the idea of saving her. Livingston initially seems unable to shoulder his share of the movie -- his pale undistinguished handsomeness suggests something undercooked and as a boozy cardsharp he doesnt exude enough attrition -- but shades of ambiguity gradually suggest depths beneath his blankness. And though the storytelling is haphazard artistry often transcends mere good intentions. Director Guy Moshe scavenges color from the torn fringes of Phnom Penh and the composer Ton-That Tiet provides a spare score laying bleary sadness over the art-house muckraking. (Music Hall) (Nick Pinkerton)MARGOT AT THE WEDDING See film featureTHE MIST See film featureNINAS HEAVENLY DELIGHTS ""A difficult choice between perfection and heavenly delight"" crows the announcer at an Indian cooking contest during this movies climax. Sadly Pratibha Parmars Ninas Heavenly Delights offers neither. What it does offer is an estranged daughter a dead father a disappointed mother a secret marriage a secret lesbian and a secret Scottish country dancer. Also a fabulously gay friend who leads a dance group called the Chutney Queens. This overloaded plot begins with the homecoming of Nina (Shelley Conn) a Glasgow native of Indian descent and follows her through the cooking contest she enters on behalf of her recently departed father an accomplished chef. Oh wait Her father may have departed from Nina but he has not departed from the movie and has an eerie tendency to make posthumous appearances (imagine the ghost of Julia Child showing up in your bedroom). Dads mantra was ""Follow your heart"" which might be why the writers sprinkle lines like ""And what about my heart?"" into their overly mushy script. Veena Sood plays Ninas mother with magisterial presence and subdued sorrow. But Conn overacts just as much as the impetuous Nina overreacts. At least her food -- simmering sauces and flaky breads that flash tantalizingly before the camera -- is reputed to be subtle. (Regent Showcase) (Abigail Deutsch)STARTING OUT IN THE EVENING See film featureTHIS CHRISTMAS Tyler Perry is going to wind up with a monopoly on mainstream adult dramas marketed to African-American audiences if quality alternatives arent produced -- and soon. This mushy bloated holiday album snapshot of an L.A. family with excess baggage by writer-director Preston A. Whitmore II is not that alternative (neither was Whitmores 2006 b-ball drama Crossover which carries the dishonor of ranking in IMDbs bottom 10 films of all time). Soapy to the extreme This Christmas takes place over a preposterously chaotic three-day weekend under the roof of divorced matriarch Ma Dear (Loretta Devine) as mulish jazz musician Quentin (Idris Elba) resurfaces for the first time in years with angry bookies in pursuit and AWOL soldier Claude (Columbus Short) lands himself in jail for pulling a gun out of pride for the pregnant white wife his family doesnt yet know about. The cast pulls off some spirited moments but the dialogue and situations are phonier than the yule log on TV. (Citywide) (Aaron Hillis)WHAT WOULD JESUS BUY? Although What Would Jesus Buy? was directed by Rob VanAlkemade it bears the unmistakable imprimatur of its producer Morgan Spurlock. Much like Spurlocks Super Size Me this production is slick well-paced and tremendously entertaining as it follows a group called Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping on a pre-Christmas tour through an endless parade of dreary Midwestern malls. According to his press bio Reverend Billy is ""an officiant of the rites of marriage in New York City and a lifelong lover of birds of prey."" More to the point hes a performance artist riffing on the persona of an evangelical minister in order to drive home to Americans just how in thrall we are to the church of consumerism. Unfortunately WWJB? never pushes past the surface of this shtick to explore the deeper forces behind our impulse to buy. It could use more interviews with the free-trade experts and anti-sweatshop activists and fewer shots of the Stop Shopping Gospel Choir exhorting Wal-Mart shoppers to well stop shopping no matter what theyre buying and why they need it.

The movie is great fun but shes enchanting. This is one of those performances that announces in the fullest sense of the term the arrival of a star. The announcement is made initially via animation. The story begins as a seemingly classic hand-painted Disney cartoon but with a cantering spirit of self-parody that the director Kevin Lima reins in safely this side of camp. Amy Adams is the voice of Giselle a commoner singing ever so tremulously and Snow Whitely about true love to a twittering audience of forest animals that includes her favorite chipmunk Pip. Already Ms. Adamss performance is audacious in its fruitcake ardor. Yet thats only a token of whats to come when Giselle on the day shes to marry a charming prince is banished by his stepmother a wicked queen to a place where there are no happy ever-afters i.e. live-action Manhattan which she enters as an extralegal alien through a Con Ed steam tunnel beneath Times Square. ENLARGE The film plays each of its worlds against the other. Its lovely to see a hitherto animated about-to-be-princess plunked down -- or rather hurtled up -- into what passes for urban reality where she natters on about how her silkworm friends made her voluminous wedding gown though the rabbits did help with the sewing. But the conceit succeeds as well as it does -- almost totally -- because the star sustains it with a tonal delicacy and poise worthy of the young Julie Andrews (who made a pretty popular picture for Disney a while ago and who provides the narrators voice in this one). Giselle thinks indoor plumbing is magical. I thought the movie was magical when Giselle having chanced to meet Robert a handsome single father and about-to-be-married divorce lawyer played by Patrick Dempsey summons an animated battalion of local animals for a thorough cleaning of his Riverside Drive apartment (and for a gleeful variation on the theme of ""Whistle While You Work""). Or when she strolls with him through Central Park bursts uncontrollably into song -- Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz did the original score -- and soon has the parks human population singing and dancing with her. Ms. Adamss triumph wont come as a complete surprise to those (few) who saw ""Junebug"" a small distinctive film in which she played with heartbreaking eloquence a pregnant young woman lost in a bad marriage and foolish dreams. Still that performance could not have predicted the variety and electrifying energy of this one any more than Mr. Limas direction of Disneys 1999 animated feature ""Tarzan"" could have predicted the verve and confidence of his live-action work here. (He directed from an original screenplay by Bill Kelly.) And ""Enchanted"" for all of its amiable borrowings and occasional stumbles truly is alive; the film doesnt feel corporate formulaic or machine-made except for a hyperventilating climax with an overwrought dragon. (And for Roberts needlessly unpleasant fiancee -- and Giselles rival -- played by Idina Menzel.) A striking departure from Disneys conventional calibrations this family entertainment treats the subject of love and marriage with sophisticated wit; at one point theres even a brief discussion of irony. But the key word is striking -- contemporary audiences will find the film refreshingly new. Movie lovers with longer memories may find affecting resonances between wide-eyed Giselle trying to figure out the love games suddenly revised rules and Josh the bewildered boy in a mans body played by Tom Hanks in ""Big"" or Jeff Danielss befuddled Tom Baxter the explorer who steps out of the movie screen in ""The Purple Rose Of Cairo."" The prince of the piece Edward is played by James Marsden. For a while I wondered if hed be able to hold his own in a role that isnt fully written Edward leaves animation land to find his fiancee only to run into a succession of real-life troubles that often depend on slapstick. But the actor is consistently likable and its perfectly fine that Edward functions mainly as a hunky buffoon. Susan Sarandon gives evil her best -- and very funny -- shot as the voice of the wicked queen while Nathaniel the princes servant is played by Timothy Spall. A virtuoso of the grotesque Mr. Spall looks animated in the flesh. Im Not There ENLARGE Richard Gere in Im Not There One of the revelations of ""No Direction Home"" Martin Scorseses documentary about Bob Dylan was the extent to which the young Dylan internalized the persona and the milieu as well as the music of Woody Guthrie. Todd Hayness counterpart to that film ""Im Not There"" takes a surreal approach to extending the observation -- that Dylan has internalized many artists and many of their qualities in the course of his remarkable career. Theres literally no Dylan on screen in this Dylan film (though the sound track abounds in his songs) because some of the singers salient qualities -- not just influences but essences -- are represented by six different actors including Christian Bale Richard Gere Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett. Its an intriguing stunt and ambitious in its effort to speak to the mystery of identity but a stunt nevertheless one that wears out its welcome with sluggish pacing excessive length and some secondary performances of surprising clumsiness. Theres nothing clumsy though about Edward Lachmans cinematography -- its revelatory from start to finish. Margot at the Wedding ENLARGE Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Jason Leigh in Margot at the Wedding Nicole Kidman plays a psyche killer in ""Margot at the Wedding"" a new film by Noah Baumbach; his debut feature was ""The Squid and the Whale."" Ms. Kidman is Margot Zeller an acerbic writer who shows up by surprise at the wedding of her estranged sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and promptly lays waste to everyone around her. Maybe Margot has a borderline personality disorder maybe not but she observes no boundaries in her infinite narcissism. And shes come to the right place since Pauline whos about to marry a petulant corpulent child (played cheerlessly by Jack Black) can give as bad as she gets when it comes to sibling rivalry. Mr. Baumbachs concern is as in his previous film the family romance and mutual need. But ""Margot"" is unsparing and ultimately punishing in its insistence on the psychodynamics of dysfunction. Its not as if this gifted filmmaker is running on empty. You just wish hed find an alternative fuel.    DVD TIP Julianne Moore is the anguished isolate Carol White in Todd Hayness ""Safe"" (1995) a surreal drama of suburbia that could be called ""Im Almost Not There."" Carol thinks her problems stem from the environment that shes a victim of fumes and noise and toxic substances. The movie suggests that its deeper than that a case of contemporary anomie that cant be cured by filters or New Age retreats. I didnt much like ""Safe"" when it came out but the film has stuck in my mind. I should take my own recommendation and see it again.

A dashing prince appears on the scene (""We shall be married in the morning"") then the films villainess transports the lass to a place ""where there are no happily-ever-afters."" Any Middle American will tell you that means New York and our formerly animated young lady (Adams) is plunged into a live-action Horror City. When she calls for furry friends to help clean an apartment its CGI rats and roaches that whistle while they work. For a split second you wonder if someone slipped a Mickey into the House of Mouses water supply and made some joyously subversive gem while the brass was asleep.No such luck. Despite the benign No-Tomorrowland Gotham our goody-two-shoes heroine has been thrust into its still just Disney business as usual. Her pure romantic demeanor wins over a cynical McDreamy lawyer (Dempsey). The clueless prince (Marsden) attacks midtown buses. Naturally the movies evil stepmom (Sarandon)--apparently auditioning for a Broadway adaptation of Aelita Queen of Mars--comes brandishing the requisite poison apples. And while no one expects the studio to slaughter its own cash cows by actually deconstructing fairy-tale mythology this bland bedtime story doesnt even offer an entertaining post-Shrek take on the original. Even Adams gamely attacking her archetypal role with glee cant fight back the saccharine tide. For a movie filled with magical occurences Enchanted commits a cardinal sin It forgets to cast a spell on the audience.

Ostensibly a freewheeling blend of the Snow White Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty fairytales Enchanted begins in conventional animated Disney territory where pretty Giselle is being courted by Edward her Prince Charming. His witchy mother however has an evil scheme on the boil and banishes Giselle to twenty-first century New York City. At this juncture the film flits from animation to live action just as Giselle (now Amy Adams) dressed to the nines in a flowing ball gown emerges from a manhole into a world of bustling humanity. Her first real-world encounter is with divorce lawyer Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) who despite sensing correctly that shes well away with the fairies eventually relents to her request for shelter and - lo and behold - begins to fall for the scatty lass. When Edward eventually appears (in the guise of James Marsden) Giselle is left facing a typically predictable rom-com dilemma.At first glance Kevin Limas contemporary urban fantasy looks hideously twee. Its only when the story hits the streets of NYC and Adams starts hamming it up (much like Julie Hagerty did in Airplane) that we start seeing the fruits of a grand Mickey-take. Giselle is clearly on another planet; she swans around singing inane songs and delivering amusingly mundane fantasy lingo in a shrill voice. Had Adams (no relation) not hammed-up her performance to such a degree and more pertinently had the film taken itself seriously one might otherwise have felt compelled to torch the screen. Instead Enchanted is one of the better family films of this year.

It shows that animation minutes cost to film more than real action we could have more of classical animation and less rosey chick-flick. Amy Adams is fantastic a joy that infuses life into a bidimensional character. Unable of replicating a grand finale from any other Disney hit Susan Sarandons character its absolutely wasted at the end.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 23 2007 Save for later Saved ""Enchanted"" is Disneys not-so-subtle attempt to coin a new franchise. Its about Giselle (Amy Adams) a would-be princess who is dispatched against her will from the fairy-tale kingdom of Andalasia to modern-day car-horn-blaring New York City. She emerges through a manhole cover in Times Square but a more appropriate site would have been the basement of a theater playing ""The Lion King.""Soon to launch are Princess Giselle product tie-ins for everything from sippy cups to dress-up costumes.Through reenactors she will become a fixture in Disney theme parks - I wouldnt be surprised if she ends up in the same animatronic arena as Abe Lincoln. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? All of which is not to say that ""Enchanted"" is a bad movie. I rather liked it as a matter of fact. These days especially one must make ones peace with the vanishing line between movie and marketeering. Only when ""Enchanted"" occasionally oversteps its bounds and becomes cloying are we reminded of the fact that its a merchandisers dream project as much as it is a movie. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 It begins as an animated movie - an old-fashioned hand-drawn animated movie. This is good news for those of us who arent sold on CGI as the genres exclusive province. Fairly quickly though the film shifts to live-action when Giselle emerges in Times Square after being banished by the witchy queen (Susan Sarandon) whose son Prince Edward (James Marsden) she was set to marry.Temporarily without a savior she falls into the reluctant good graces of Robert (Patrick Dempsey) a cynical divorce lawyer and single father with an 8-year-old daughter (Rachel Covey) who being a child naturally believes Giselles line about being a fairy-tale princess. Director Kevin Lima and screenwriter Bill Kelly set a very simple agenda As Giselle becomes less starry-eyed Robert falls for her. He learns that sometimes there is such as thing as ""happily ever after.""The whole trick here is creating a universe so magical that our own cynicism along with Roberts is dispelled. The filmmakers are somewhat successful mainly whenever Adams is onscreen. As anyone who saw her in ""Junebug"" can attest Adams is one of those rare actresses who projects a sweetness that seems entirely genuine. Lima overdoes the close-ups of her but it doesnt matter since her presence is continually entrancing.There is probably nothing more difficult for a performer than to play absolute goodness without becoming a great big sugary bore - which is one reason most of the successful pure-in-heart Disney creations have been animated rather than flesh-and-blood characters. Adams is one of the few actors who can bring off the entrancements of an animated character without seeming stunted or cutesey.The film overall is well performed. Dempseys Robert is believably smitten by Giselle which is to say he is smitten in small telling increments.With his square-cut jaw and megahandsomeness Marsden already looks like a comic-book prince. He has a funny faintly deprecating air similar to what Christopher Reeve had in ""Superman."" Although Sarandon doesnt have enough screen time her emissary and servant Nathaniel played by roly-poly Timothy Spall might have stepped right out of ""The Wind and the Willows.""I was less taken with the films attempts to be all things to all people - stage show animated feature musical romance. The big numbers by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz are hummable all right but in that strenuously show-biz way that ensures youll be hearing them again on Oscar night as part of some spangly production number.It may sound like faint praise to say that ""Enchanted"" is the movie of the year for smart and spirited 11-year-old girls. But a movie that genuinely respects that audience is not to be belittled. Grade B+ Next up Modern Parenthood A twist on the fairy tale a college-bound Disney Princess?

"Theres something rotten about Enchanted. Slate Sign In Sign Up Theres something rotten about Enchanted. Theres something rotten about Enchanted. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 29 2007 648 PM Princess MasterCard Theres something rotten about Enchanted. By Dana Stevens Enchanted It looks like the 2007 holiday season has found its grandma movie that family-friendly release you can schlep the whole clan to without spending the entire running time regretting your own birth. Enchanted the Disney fairy tale spoof starring Amy Adams as an animated heroine whos banished from her cartoon kingdom to live-action New York earned 50.5 million in its first week winning the holiday weekend and outperforming every Disney Thanksgiving release since Toy Story 2 (1999). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Adams an actress whos dwelt on the edge of recognizablity for the past several years (nominated for a supporting-actress Oscar for Junebug in 2005 she also did a multiepisode stint on The Office and gave Will Ferrell a memorably suggestive pep talk in Talladega Nights) will no doubt become a household name and a hot Hollywood property as a result of Enchanted. As the innocent and indomitably chirpy Giselle she gives the great female comic performance of the year so far somehow making her three-dimensional 33-year-old human body seem as weightless and diaphanous as the outline of a cartoon princess. Adams prances away with the movie though some fellow cast members--especially James Marsden as a besotted prince and Timothy Spall as a scheming courtier--prove worthy foils. Even the leaden presence of Patrick Dempsey as the pragmatic divorce lawyer who turns out to be Giselles unexpected true love in the live-action world cant ruin the movies light touch and spun-sugar mood. Advertisement But there was something that depressed me about Enchanted a grim reality that occasionally peeped through the whimsy like New York City glimpsed from the animated fields of Andalasia. This sinking feeling had little to do with what could be seen as the movies retrograde affirmation of true love and happy endings--after all if youre going to start complaining about marriage as a plot resolution device you have to throw out every comedy from Shakespeare on down. No that intermittent sense of yuckiness sprang from the movies solemn celebration of a ritual even more sacred than holy matrimony shopping. Late in the film theres a crisis when Giselle needs to prepare for the ball where both her cartoon-world betrothed Prince Edward (Marsden) and her real-world crush Robert (Dempsey) will be in attendance along with her rival for Dempseys affections Nancy (Idina Menzel). Since her arrival in New York the stranded princess has been making do with outfits she whips up from curtains and bedspreads with help from her urban animal friends (pigeons roaches and rats). But the ball is another matter; for an occasion like this Giselle needs an outfit only a fairy godmother can provide. So Morgan (Rachel Covey) Roberts 6-year-old daughter proposes a solution ""I know something better than a fairy godmother"" she trills reaching into a drawer for her daddys credit card. There follows a shopping montage in which the two dash in and out of a series of Manhattan boutiques (real-life brand names prominently displayed) accumulating an impressive pile of purchases. Finally we see them getting makeovers at a salon surrounded by a mountain of shopping bags. Smiling shyly at the lovely young woman whos just entered her divorced fathers life Morgan asks ""Is this what its like to go shopping with your mother?"" Of course ""shopping with your mother"" specifically for femininity-enhancing wallet-reducing princess clothes is precisely the activity that propels the global Disney empire forward. The scene between Morgan and Giselle in the spa isnt played for irony; these two are truly bonding over the manicure counter and Morgans mission to save the day via retail proves successful. Giselle looks fabulous at the ball lands the right prince without offending the wrong one and vanquishes an evil-queen-turned-dragon (Susan Sarandon) on top of the Woolworth Building. When we last see Giselle (in a clever coda that wraps up each characters story in pop-up book form) shes running a successful business called ""Andalasia Fashions"" that caters to royalty-obsessed (and presumably well-to-do) little girls. Surrounded by seas of tulle she measures one child as others gather around her in candy-colored frocks. The goodwill Adams has generated for her character at this point makes this feel like a happy even vaguely feminist ending--at least Giselle wont be living off her true loves paycheck But still I couldnt suppress that yuck factor Does these little girls happily-ever-after consist only in getting Mommy to buy the right dress? Because of the difficulty of securing lifetime rights to the image of Amy Adams Disney recently decided not to include Giselle in its official lineup of princesses. (Cinderella Snow White Sleeping Beauty Ariel Belle and Jasmine. As the Wall Street Journal notes Pocahontas and Mulan remain ""largely on the sidelines"" and it remains to be seen where Princess Tiana the first African-American Disney princess will land in the hierarchy.) Still Giselle dolls are on the market for Christmas and toddlers who want to dress as Giselle brides next Halloween (does the image of a 3-year-old bride make anyone elses flesh crawl?) can already find costumes on eBay. Disney can afford to poke fun at a lot of things about itself and in Enchanted it does exactly that to largely charming effect. But the marketing of princesshood? Thats serious business.

"Enchanted | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; enchanted ) Enchanted (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Once upon a time Disney was the king of animation. Today in the realm of CGI and 3D they remain at the top only by virtue of a partnership with Pixar. Hand-drawn animation - the kind responsible for many of Disneys most beloved classics - is passe (although there are frequent rumors of re-invigorating it) giving all big-screen cartoons the degree of sameness that results from increased computer participation. With Enchanted Disney is opening a new front in the ongoing animation war. Call it ""live action animation."" While this is certainly not the first motion picture to blend drawn creations with real life actors no movie to date has approached it quite this way. The movie opens in the animated world of Andalasia where Giselle (Amy Adams) a headstrong character in the best Disney tradition dreams (with a little singing and dancing thrown in for good measure) of true love with a prince. That prince Edward (James Marsden) is also a crooner and he falls for Giselle the moment he meets her. One person who isnt happy about this match is Edwards step-mother Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon). She devises a plot to take Giselle far beyond Edwards reach - by banishing her to New York City. Abetted by his manservant Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and a talking chipmunk Edward goes after Giselle. Once in Times Square the animation is gone. However although the characters are now played by flesh-and-blood human beings their personalities remain cartoonish. Giselle is unbelievably perky Edward is manly (but not too bright) and the chipmunk (despite having lost his voice) shows brain power far in excess of what one might expect. Giselle is ""rescued"" from her predicament of being stranded in a strange land by single parent Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his young daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey). Robert may not believe her story but he cannot leave her to fend for herself. For Giselle this leads to an inevitable question Who is her real prince - Edward or Robert? The films animated sequences have successfully captured the look and feel of classic Disney movies albeit perhaps with tongue planted a little in cheek. Enchanteds director Kevin Lima was at the helm for Tarzan. The music is provided by veteran Alan Menken who along with his late partner Howard Ashman was responsible for the production numbers in The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. The animated scenes that form the prologue arent long but they serve as a valentine for anyone who looks back nostalgically at the kinds of movies Disney no longer makes. The juxtaposition of an animated character in a real body creates some intriguing fish-out-of-water situations several of which are effectively exploited by the screenplay. (Writer Billy Kelly also penned another fish-out-of-water film Blast from the Past.) Eventually however the real world begins to influence Giselles two-dimensional sprightliness. Like a bizarre amalgamation of Pinocchio and Eliza Doolittle she transforms under Roberts tutelage from a three-dimensional representation of a two-dimensional personality into someone who is fully rounded in all ways. For Edward and Nathaniel something similar happens although without Roberts influence as a catalyst it happens more slowly. Enchanteds most obvious asset is Amy Adams who is probably best known for her scene-stealing work in Junebug. Here she outshines everyone around her including the intentionally low-key Patrick Dempsey. Dempsey whose career was resurrected by the television show Greys Anatomy has begun to do movies again and he exhibits a more mature version of the charm that made him a hit with teenage audiences during the 1980s. Meanwhile Susan Sarandon gets to wear an outrageous costume and spout over-the-top dialogue - something she hasnt gotten a chance to do since The Witches of Eastwick. Enchanted earns its label as a ""family film"" by virtue of its ability to captivate audience members both young and old. The storyline tone and approach are strictly animated but the filmmakers decision to present most of the action using real people makes Enchanted feel more unique than might otherwise be the case. Enchanted may not be great cinema but its worthy of its title.

Share Tweet Its only been three years since Disney released Home On The Range the studios last hand-drawn animated feature but the animated world has changed in the meantime. Aside from a few remarkable exceptions--almost all courtesy of Pixar--the default computer-animated cartoon now centers around pop-culture parodies celebrities playing slight variations on their well-known personas and tired you-can-do-it plots. They arent all bad but for those who would trade a hundred Open Seasons for one Pinocchio (or maybe even Brother Bear at this point) its been a long dry spell. Beginning with an animated sequence in which a tuneful young woman named Giselle (voiced by Amy Adams) sings a song about true love with considerable aid from a bevy of cartoon animals Disneys mostly live-action fantasy Enchanted briefly returns to the 2D animation of old; the scene is cheeky and self-parodying while still capturing everything great about the old approach. (It helps that the song ""True Loves Kiss"" comes from skilled veterans Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz.) But after incurring the wrath of a wicked queen (Susan Sarandon) Giselle cant stay in that magical world and neither can we. Dropped into 21st-century America (and played in live action by Adams) she winds up lost in the wilds of Manhattan a place where old kind-looking men steal from you and nobody can tell you how to get to the castle. Taken in by a reluctant single-dad lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) with a princess-fixated daughter Adams unintentionally rivals Dempseys career-minded girlfriend (Idina Menzel) for his affections. Where Shrek and its too many sequels brought modern irony into a fairy-tale world Enchanted reverses the formula. Almost perversely innocent--her typical morning greeting goes ""Oh I hope you had nice dreams""--Adams unsettles everyone she meets. The gag wouldnt work with just anyone in the lead but Adams openhearted performance never winks. She really does want the best for everyone and cant fathom why they dont all feel the same. Shes unshakably sweet and heartbreakingly vulnerable like a puppy in human form. She even makes it almost-possible to buy the films attempts to hold her up as a role model. But the romance doesnt work so well if only because its tough to generate chemistry between flesh-and-blood and a living cartoon. Bits with Adams cartoon prince (James Marsden) his duplicitous sidekick (Timothy Spall) and an annoying CGI squirrel dont really work either nor does the frenzied special-effects-heavy climax. But Adams winning performance and the light touch director Kevin Lima (a veteran of animation and live action) brings to scenes not tasked with advancing the plot all suggest that silly as they may look once you take it apart irony-free romantic fantasy--animated and otherwise--still has a place on the big screen.

(AP Photo/Disney) AP Photo/Disney Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Surely this was inevitable. After years of watching the monstrously successful ""Shrek"" franchise parody everything beloved about those classic animated Disney movies Disney is showing a sense of humor and making fun of itself. ""Enchanted"" has a song in its heart and a tongue in its cheek both in animated and live-action forms with an infectious energy that helps overcome the scripts contrivances.New Movie Reviews""Enchanted"" Is Fairy Tale FunTerror In ""The Mist""Bob Dylans Many Faces ""Margot"" Has A Mean Streak""August Rush"" Hits A Low NoteWide-eyed would-be princess Giselle (the irresistible Amy Adams) is banished by the wicked Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) from her idyllic cartoon playland to the harsh reality of Times Square before she can marry her one true love Prince Edward (James Marsden). (Though truly Times Square was Disneyfied a long time ago so in theory it shouldnt have been that much of a shock.) Back in the magical land of Andalasia Giselle could just call out the window of her cozy home sing a lilting song and all the friendly forest creatures would come scurrying to her side to help with whatever chore she needed -- clean the house sew a dress or just hang out and look furry and cute. Her best friend of all is a chipmunk named Pip (who completely steals the show once ""Enchanted"" goes live-action). Giselle is an amalgamation of every Disney princess youve ever known Cinderella Snow White and Sleeping Beauty with a little bit of Ariel and Belle thrown in for good measure. And Adams is absolutely adorable in the role. She gets the innate humor within the characters innocence yet remains respectfully faithful to it.She may have gained minor attention for her Oscar-nominated supporting role in ""Junebug"" but ""Enchanted"" ought to make her a star. (And thats really her singing too.) But because Giselle is so beautiful and perfect Prince Edwards stepmother the queen views her as a major threat (and Sarandon is deliciously evil in the part). So it doesnt take long after Edward gallops up on his white horse and promptly asks Giselle to marry him for Narissa to send her down a well which leads to - where else? New York City. Cold wet and confused Giselle nonetheless finds a home through the sheer power of her sweetness and optimism with sensible divorce lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his adoring 6-year-old daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey). Turns out her charms work on hardened Manhattanites too; a lavish production number in Central Park featuring mariachis balloons rollerbladers and construction workers is over-the-top but knowingly so and fun. But then the city charms Giselle right back and she finds herself torn between both worlds and both men even after Edward arrives to search for her with the queens lackey (Timothy Spall) in tow. Marsden also seems to be having a blast playing with his pretty-boy looks and as he showed this summer as Corny Collins in ""Hairspray"" hes solid in the musical-theater department too. Little girls and tweens will love this movie especially those who are into the whole princess thing and adults will laugh heartily and often at the way director Kevin Lima (""102 Dalmatians"") and writer Bill Kelly tweak familiar fairy-tale details. Certainly this is not a new phenomenon. Look at the send-ups like ""Hoodwinked"" and ""Happily NEver After"" that came along and tried to cash in on ""Shreks"" success. But ""Enchanted"" does it with obvious affection impeccable craftsmanship and zero snark. Songs from multiple Oscar winners Alan Menken (""The Little Mermaid"" ""Beauty and the Beast"" ""Aladdin"") and Stephen Schwartz (""Pocahontas"" ""The Prince of Egypt"") and splashy polished dance numbers complete the package. So maybe its not a whole new world but its one you already know and love quite well. ""Enchanted"" a Walt Disney Pictures release is rated PG for some scary images and mild innuendo.

Photo Barry Wetcher / SMPSP Review Snow White gets a rude awakening in Enchanted 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Enchanted Fantasy comedy. Starring Amy Adams Patrick Dempsey James Marsden Rachel Covey Timothy Spall Idina Menzel and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Kevin Lima. (PG. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) The advance word on Disneys ""Enchanted"" was that its a star-making vehicle for Amy Adams who plays a fairy-tale heroine plunked down in todays Manhattan where things dont always turn out happily ever after. Now the film is here and Adams does offer quite a turn Portraying a version of Disneys Snow White she owns the character down to every warble and twirl. Adams Giselle actually first appears as an animated figure. In fact the whole opening sequence is in hand-drawn animation and its a nice summing up of a classic Disney fairy-tale motif the captivating young woman who sings while she works and gets help with the chores from cheerful woodland animals. The cartoon segment introduces other main characters the vain and vacuous Prince Edward who intends to marry Giselle; his villainous mother Queen Narissa who magically banishes her to the Big Apple to prevent the wedding; and the queens comic henchman Nathaniel. Theres also a high-spirited chipmunk. Transported through a magic well these animated figures become flesh-and-blood characters portrayed by James Marsden (Edward) Susan Sarandon (the queen) and Timothy Spall (Nathaniel). (The chipmunk becomes a CGI effect.) Once the films in Manhattan we meet more characters lawyer and single dad Robert (Patrick Dempsey) his 6-year-old daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) and his girlfriend Nancy (Idina Menzel). The point is to drop fairy-tale figures with their ultra-romantic notions into the unhappy ""real"" world of broken families street crime angry drivers and all the rest (somewhat sanitized for a family movie). When Giselle pops up in Times Square she soon finds herself wandering in her hoop skirt through the Bowery where she is ripped off and drenched in a rainstorm. Robert and his daughter passing by in a cab spot the beleaguered young woman and offer help though Robert initially hesitates. Giselles appearance puts Nancy into a jealous spin and Nathaniel assumes various guises to try to trick Giselle into eating a poisoned apple provided by the wicked queen. Edward who loves himself as much as Giselle appears in New York and sword in hand tracks her down with information gleaned from a magic mirror (i.e. a TV set in a cheesy motel). The queen also has to turn up to work her malicious will. Director Kevin Lima delivers a couple of entertaining set pieces When Giselle tidies up Roberts apartment her trilling song attracts the assistance not of cute woodsy critters but of pigeons and rats. And theres a pull-out-all-stops song-and-dance number set in Central Park. (The music is by veterans Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz.) Lima also deserves kudos for not standing in the way of Adams performance - she fulfills the promise of her work in ""Junebug"" (2005) the movie that first got her noticed with an Academy Award nomination for supporting actress. The roles of Marsden Sarandon and Spall are tailor-made for hamming it up and thats what the actors do. Dempsey of ""Greys Anatomy"" fame doesnt get to have nearly as much fun playing the dad whos a bit of a wet blanket. The director does make a serious misstep The special effects sequence near the end involving Queen Narissas transformation seems dragged in from a different movie. But he did have the good sense to hire Julie Andrews as the narrator. -- AdvisorySome scary images and mild innuendo.

And when the heroine pops up in New York City dazed by her transformation from animated cartoon girl to live-action beauty shes put up for the night by a stranger a harried divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey). But theres a hygiene problem. Hes the distracted single parent to a little girl (Rachel Covey) his girlfriend (Idina Menzel) is on his case for more commitment -- and with no time to clean his apartment is a mess. So Giselle does what any classically trained sweet-natured Disney heroine would do With a lilting yodel she summons her charmed animal friends to help her tidy up and they sing sing sing while they toil. Of course this being New York the wildlife workforce consists of rats pigeons mice and well-organized cockroaches. The hilarious ""Happy Working Song "" production number with music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz encapsulates the joys of Enchanted -- an unironic affection for classic Disney fairy tales of old salted with modern smarts about how the non-Disney world really works for single parents kids working women divorce lawyers and cockroaches. Somewhere deep in the movies genetic structure is a chromosome or two of Rocky and Bullwinkles bi-level wit mixed in with the DNA of Mary Poppins. The resourceful heroine is soul sister to Cinderella Sleeping Beauty and Snow White and as such she comes accessorized with a handsome fairy-tale prince (Hairsprays James Marsden wonderfully earnest and therefore charming as a princely dolt). But New York works its own magic on Giselle -- and so does Lawyer McDreamy. Enchanted is festooned with extravagant set pieces -- theres a great number in praise of romantic gestures and a ballroom scene to make even grown-up girls swoon. So I hope no one thinks me a mean stepsister when I say that the movie is also one baggy final act too long as Sarandons whole evil-older-woman subplot climaxes with a technically showy but really dragging chase and rescue sequence of a King Kong kind. An old queen ought to know when to step aside and let the next Disney generation claim the crown.

"Enchanted Delightful Disney tale | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEnchanted Delightful Disney taleEnchanted the most thoroughly delightful Disney release in many a moon harkens back to an almost forgotten era when the late Walt and his crew could do no wrong.The irrepressible Amy Adams is a most worthy successor to Julie Andrews song-and-dance crown.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Nov. 21 2007Starring Amy Adams Patrick Dempsey Susan Sarandon and Timothy Spall. Directed by Kevin Lima. 107 minutes. At major theatres. PGEnchanted the most thoroughly delightful Disney release in many a moon harkens back to an almost forgotten era when the late Walt and his crew could do no wrong.As far back as 1964 Mary Poppins and its charismatic star Julie Andrews bridged the animation/reality divide with a musical that truly was magical. It was one of Walt Disneys favourites and youd have to think hed be almost as enamoured with Enchanted a tale about a lost princess thats bound to be remembered long after this holiday season.It has its own fabulous femme in the irrepressible Amy Adams (Junebug) a most worthy successor to Andrews song-and-dance crown - a fact Andrews tacitly acknowledges with her ""Once upon a time"" narration.Enchanted combines traditional animation with live-action comedy and computer-generated imagery (CGI). Its a high-wire act done with glass slippers a move too far in any direction could easily have toppled the entire production.Article Continued BelowDirector Kevin Lima and screenwriter Bill Kelly have the chops to handle a hybrid. Lima worked on Beauty and the Beast The Little Mermaid and Aladdin three of the better Disney animations and his live-action resume includes 102 Dalmations and Eloise at the Plaza. Kelly wrote the movie comedy Blast From the Past which shares Enchanteds sense of discovery.The plot of Enchanted reads like a dozen Disney classics (Snow White being the most obvious) and thats precisely the point. In the cartoon prologue lonely princess Giselle (Adams) serenades woodland creatures in the fairytale land of Andalusia as she waits for a handsome prince to deliver her ""True Loves Kiss"" the title of one of several hummable tunes penned by Broadway and film vets Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz.Handy Prince Edward (James Marsden) is the perfect match but the couples wedding plans are foiled by Edwards evil mother Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon who is even more bitchy and beastly than Cruella De Vil). Narissa exiles Giselle down a sewer hole to ""a place where there are no happily ever afters"" modern New York. The arrival in Times Square of the hoop-skirted bride-to-be startles even jaded Manhattanites but Giselle is most puzzled of all especially when she realizes shes been turned into a human.Shes befriended by divorced single dad Robert (Patrick Dempsey ""Dr. McDreamy"" of Greys Anatomy) and his 6-year-old daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey). The timing of Giselles arrival isnt great. Robert and his girlfriend (Idina Menzel) have big plans but Giselle isnt the only interruption forces both good and evil are following her down the rabbit hole. They include feisty chipmunk Pip part of a CGI menagerie that also makes merry with Manhattans rats and roaches.How refreshing it is that Enchanted gently makes fun of Disney tradition while upholding it at the same time. There are no cheap or vulgar jokes and sentiment never turns to treacle. The magicians behind this trick have devised a new Disney alchemy for every spoonful of sugar you need a single drop of vinegar for that extra high kick.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Directed by Kevin Lima from a screenplay by Bill Kelly. 107 minutes. Rated PG for some scary images and mild innuendo. Several theaters. When Amy Adams opens her mouth in ""Enchanted"" you half expect a Technicolor butterfly to emerge from it so perfect is her take on a dewy Disney princess. Wide of eye and fluttery of voice she plays Giselle who lives a perfect life in the animated kingdom of Andalasia singing to the animals and doing whatever else it is that Disney princesses do all day. But quicker than you can warble ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" Giselle gets in trouble with the evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) and off shes whooshed down a magic well and into ... the real and decidedly nonanimated New York City. An irresistible blend of screwball comedy and Disney fairy-tale musical ""Enchanted"" takes its enchanting premise and prances away with it holding the audience happily captive. Directed by Kevin Lima from a witty screenplay by Bill Kelly its that rare movie experience You watch it smiling. The details feel just right down to the brief narration provided by -- but who else? -- Julie Andrews. And Adams whos remembered fondly by anyone who saw her ditzy-but-wise Ashley in ""Junebug"" (for which she received an Oscar nomination) delivers a full-on star turn. Gliding along the sidewalks of Manhattan in her poufy marshmallow of a wedding gown (its the best wedding-dress wrangling since Joan Cusack in ""In amp; Out"") Giselle is a pretty fish far from water. In one of the films funny running gags shes mostly ignored -- it takes more than an animated-character-come-to-life to get the attention of blase New Yorkers. Finally after a long night of wandering shes discovered by a handsome fellow named Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his 6-year-old daughter (Rachel Covey). Familiar complications ensue including the arrival of a handful of other animated characters from Andalasia Prince Edward (James Marsden) in love with Giselle; his chipmunk sidekick Pip whos horrified to learn that chipmunks cant talk in this world; and the evil queen herself whose leather-ish gown and platform boots fit right in. Anyone whos seen a Disney movie knows where this is going and that Robert will turn out to be a prince of a guy. But the pleasure here is in the journey in watching Adams burst into lilting song as a crew of animals (roaches rats and flies -- this is New York) help her clean up Roberts apartment or flounce around town in a homemade dress that makes her look like some sort of insane bridesmaid. Dempsey an admirably befuddled foil eyes her with suspicion and gradually something sweeter. ""Its like you escaped from a Hallmark card or something"" he tells her. As it turns out this princess needs no prince to rescue her. But ""Enchanted"" does give us all the best of fairy tales -- including a glamorous ball a glass slipper and a charmingly twisted happily-ever-after.

""Thats what I thought was going to happen"" Glover said. ""And even though this isnt really what I expected its still good."" Glover and his Red Storm teammates entered last nights NIT semifinal against Texas Tech with an optimistic attitude something they didnt always think would be possible. ""Look we all wanted to make the NCAA - and not to be there is still disappointing"" Glover said. ""But it looked like we might lose to Duke and our record was going to be 12-13 and now were here. You have to be all right with that."" Head coach Mike Jarvis called that Garden victory ""as important a win as Ive ever had"" because of the spark it gave the team. And a big reason it meant so much to him is that it has given Glover now a graduate student a chance to go out with a championship. ""Anthony has been through so much since hes been here"" said Jarvis whose team with a victory would play tomorrow against the winner of last nights other semifinal between Minnesota and Georgetown. ""He never complains about anything. He deserves this run more than anyone and Im happier than heck that hes got it."" Jarvis recalled how Glover committed to St. Johns when he came out of Rice High School - even though the Red Storm were without a coach. ""I hadnt taken the job yet so he didnt know what he was getting himself into"" Jarvis said. ""When I got here I told him how impressed I was by that and hes done nothing to change that since."" Especially after his performance in the tournament quarterfinals. Glover had struggled offensively the two previous games shooting a combined 3-for-15 but against UAB he scored a team-high 16 points on 7-of-10 shooting in three quarters. ""Ive been here a long time and I knew if we were going to win this championship I would have to do more"" Glover said. ""The first shot that I took went in and I knew it was going to be a good night."" He hopes that kind of play continues but he isnt particularly concerned about it. ""We knew we had the ability all along to do more than we were doing during the regular season"" Glover said. ""We have the skill level to play in the NCAA. Now that were playing the way we are theres no reason we cant keep winning."" Thats what Glover believed last year when he opted to stay around for another season. ""I had more I wanted to accomplish so it was easy for me to stay"" said Glover who as a 6-5 post player is too small to play in the NBA. ""Weve done some good things since Ive been here like advance in the NCAA tournament and win the Big East. But we havent won a tournament like this in the postseason. Thats what I want.""

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday June 3 2008 332 PM EnchantedPart animated part live-action fantasy about a fairy tale character lost in Manhattan. With Amy Adams Patrick Dempsey. Director Kevin Lima (147). PG Mild scares innuendo. At area theaters.A postmodern tweak on old-fashioned fairy tales Disneys latest is not quite as subversive as it pretends to be. But it is both cute and clever enough to enchant little girls - not to mention their mothers.""Enchanted"" will also make a star out of gifted lead Amy Adams who may earn the sort of grade-school respect previously reserved for women named Jasmine Ariel and Belle. When narrator Julie Andrews first introduces Giselle (Adams) shes an animated beauty who is as Disney characters are wont to do singing about love with a cheerful chorus of forest animals. She finds it with Edward (James Marsden) a square-jawed pea-brained prince. But Edwards vicious stepmother (Susan Sarandon) hates Giselle and banishes her ""to a place where there are no happily-ever-afters"" - better known among the evil and ignorant as Manhattan. When Giselle lands in Times Square the movie shifts from animation to live action and our naive heroine wanders in confusion until she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey). Robert is a busy lawyer with no time for strange women who wear ball gowns and sing in public especially since hes about to propose to his girlfriend (Idina Menzel). At the insistence of his precocious daughter (Rachel Covey) however he reluctantly helps Giselle find her prince who is now striding around New York with a servant (Timothy Spall) in tow determined to rescue his fiancee. But the more Robert teaches her about the real world the less appealing Giselles old life appears. Does she even need rescuing? Maybe she can rescue someone else instead - like say a harried single dad. Overall director Kevin Lima and writer Bill Kelly have a grand time upending the genres cliches as do Adams and a hilarious Marsden. Dempsey doesnt work as hard but he does look dreamy which seems to be the primary reason he was cast. But while ""Enchanted"" wittily updates traditional tales it is in the end as carefully calculated in its appeal as any movie ever was. Dont be surprised to see Giselles name on this years Christmas lists right next to all of Disneys other princesses. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

WALT DISNEY PICTURES Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez Miami Herald Enchanted is not the first Walt Disney movie in which cartoon characters cross over into the realm of flesh-and-blood human beings. But it is the first one I can recall in which the animated aliens are unrecognizable from ordinary people. When the sing-song princess Giselle (Amy Adams) crawls out of a manhole cover into New Yorks Times Square the only thing that distinguishes her from the hordes of tourists around her is the ridiculously poofy wedding dress shes wearing. Unaware that shes been the victim of a scheme by an evil queen (Susan Sarandon) to prevent Giselle from marrying her son (James Marsden) the princess is befuddled by the strange new world she must navigate. Relying on the kindness of a divorced dad (Patrick Dempsey) and his 6-year old daughter (Rachel Covey) Giselle gradually starts to get her bearings discovering that just because shes now in present-day Manhattan does not mean she can no longer enlist animals to help her with household chores or launch into full-blown musical numbers in which strangers passing by are suddenly compelled to join into the singing and dancing. Much of the humor of Enchanted which was directed by Disney veteran Kevin Lima (Tarzan 102 Dalmatians) and features music co-written by Alan Menken (The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast) comes in seeing how the film affectionally spoofs animated-fantasy formulas from the Snow White/Sleeping Beauty-type heroine to the gallant prince rushing to her rescue. Adams (Junebug) occasionally overdoes Giselles golly-gee-whiz innocence -- her performance begins on a high-pitched note and has nowhere to go but up -- but her excesses are tempered by Dempseys unaffected laid-back charms as well as Marsdens humorously clumsy valiant hero. It is a testament to just how well Enchanted works that by the time a dragon is flying around New York City youve forgotten all about the movies high-concept humor and become invested in the plight of its characters instead.

"Enchanted? Absolutely - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Enchanted? AbsolutelyAmy Adams brings an animated princess to life -- and then some.November 21 2007|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer Its obvious but inescapable ""Enchanted"" is as good as its name. An adroit combination of wised-up and happily-ever-after its story of an animation princess thrust into New Yorks gritty reality gently mocks the mighty Disney fantasy machine without losing the core of the franchises family appeal.Perhaps because even mild self-mockery has never been the Disney way this romantic comedy with music spent more than a decade locked away in development hell. Although one wouldnt wish that on anyone those 10 years led to several positive developments including the return to Bill Kellys much rewritten script.And though that decade did contribute to ""Enchanteds"" only misstep a finale uncharacteristically weighted toward reliance on CGI effects it also put Kevin Lima a live action filmmaker with a natural feel for animation (he co-directed Disneys 1999 ""Tarzan"") in the directors seat.Best of all that time period allowed the casting of the wonderful Amy Adams as Giselle a princess in the animated kingdom of Andalasia who gets the rudest of awakenings when she finds herself pushed out of a Times Square manhole cover and into Manhattan street life.Adams who was Oscar-nominated for her breakout role in ""Junebug"" is equally splendid here as the ultimate Disney princess whose every step echoes ""Snow White"" ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Cinderella."" Playing perky and gee-whiz Adams never overdoes the earnestness or even hints at condescending to the role and it is impossible to think of ""Enchanted"" without her.It is also difficult to imagine this film without the decades of Disney animated features that have come before it appealing to audiences for generations because theyve created an alternate universe that bans nasty reality from the premises.""Enchanteds"" Andalasia in the 10-minute animated glimpse of it we have as the film begins is such a place. Giselle surrounded by helpful animals and the dashing Prince Edward (James Marsden Cyclops in the ""X-Men"" movies) know they are destined to be united by ""true loves kiss"" but evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) and her henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) manage to keep them apart.Worse than that once the pair meet and plan to wed in the morning Narissa pushes Giselle down a seemingly bottomless well. Where are you sending her? squeaks Nathaniel. ""To a place where there are no happily-ever-afters"" booms the queen. Enter on cue New York City.The bright and cheerful Giselle no surprise is ill-suited to Manhattan and not just because her huge ball gown makes it hard to walk around. Shes never even heard of anger and is so hungry for a kind word that when someone sarcastically says ""Welcome to New York"" she brightly answers ""Thank you""This creature of total goodness runs into unemotional divorce lawyer Robert Phillip (""Greys Anatomys"" Patrick Dempsey) who so doesnt believe in magic that he gives daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) ""Important Women of the World"" for her birthday instead of the fairy tale book she desires.Not understanding that they are literally from different worlds Robert and Giselle initially dont know what to make of each other.Robert is especially poleaxed by Giselles ability to make animals do her bidding though this being New York the animals are rats pigeons and roaches. His career-minded girlfriend Nancy (""Wickeds"" Idina Menzel) is more baffled than he is.Giselle is not the only Andalasian in town for long. While shes breaking into song and getting everyone in Central Park to participate in a production number (Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartzs ""Thats How You Know"") thats a pure delight everyone from her prince to Nathaniel to her favorite chipmunk Pip is making their way to these mean streets.Everything resolves in typical Disney fashion which is what we all wanted in the first place. In any earlier era this resolution would have not involved the intrusive crutch of CGI imagery but that is a price hardly worth mentioning for the pleasures ""Enchanted"" provides.kenneth.turanlatimes.com""Enchanted"" MPAA rated PG for some scary images and mild innuendo.

Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) and her newfound love interest lawyer Robert share a meal and a laugh in Enchanted. Photo Walt Disney Pictures Enchanted 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Once upon a time an animated maiden long popular with woodland creatures fell in love with a handsome prince in puffy sleeves. They met after an incident with a troll and sang a duet called True Loves Kiss preparing to marry the next day. It all might have gone off like a dream had a certain evil queen-slash-wicked-stepmother not shoved her down a well. The maiden didnt die; she simply re-emerged in 21st-century New York City specifically a manhole near the Mama Mia banner in Times Square. Then she almost got creamed by oncoming traffic. Thats the gimmick behind Enchanted a gently meta fairy tale that pokes fun at Disneys animated classics just never too hard to hurt. The Mouse will only mock itself so far. But this is a small charmer of a family movie - no modern masterwork a bit too reminiscent of other fish-out-of-water romances (e.g. Splash) yet airy and fluffy and humorous enough to throw a few sparks of its own enchantment. The first is a handful of tunes by the celebrated songwriting duo of Alan Mencken and Stephen Schwartz who parody the swoopy anthems and sweetie-pie ballads of typical Disney standards including some of their own. The opening sequence set in the cartoon land of Andalasia is meant to look and sound like Cinderella or Snow White or Beauty and the Beast or any hybrid combo involving magic spells and starry romance. And when the young lady Giselle (a superlatively flaky Amy Adams) ventures forth into the real city meeting a real lawyer named Robert (a superlatively bland Patrick Dempsey) with a real daughter named Morgan (Rachel Covey) in a real cluttered apartment the resulting collisions of fairy land and material world are touched with spoofy ingenuity. Her approach to domestic hygiene (recalling Ratatouille a Disney/Pixar film) delights and disgusts. The films splashy production number in Central Park does the same minus the disgust and all scenes involving a pantomiming anthropomorphic chipmunk are good zippy fun. Zippiest of all is the transported Prince himself - a witless but earnest fop who arrives puffy sleeves intact in the person of X-Man James Marsden. Marsden proved he could sing in Hairspray. Here he proves he can mug with the best of them ripping off broad physical comedy and prissy hammy mannerisms with flat-out killer timing. The Prince is such a blast to watch so joyously inane that he makes Dempseys lawyer seem like the cartoon cutout gloomy underplayed resigned to his role as straight man and total bummer. Its his job to tell everyone else what fools they are to believe in ``this dreams-come-true nonsense. Disney veteran Kevin Lima (Tarzan 102 Dalmations) directs easily and breezily most of the time but the movie cracks a gigantic yawn whenever Robert opens his mouth to speak. And the plot loses some of its comic fizz when the Evil Queen (Susan Sarandon metallic headgear and all) elbows her way into the action though I suppose she had to. Wicked stepmothers will out. Everything droops near the close. Giselles transformation to modern gal relies too much on shopping and musical nitpickers (me for instance) might wish that a climactic ballroom ``waltz had actually been in three-four time. The ending is entirely pre-packaged and foreordained and if you cant predict what happens you dont know your poison apples from your singing princesses. Ill give you a hint though They all live ever after.

STEPHEN COLE Special to The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 21 2007 1200AM EST Last updated Saturday Mar. 14 2009 128AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English ENCHANTED Directed by Kevin Lima Written by Bill Kelly Starring Amy Adams Patrick Dempsey James Marsden Susan Sarandon Timothy Spall Rachel Covey and Idina Menzel Narrated by Julie Andrews Classification G  Enchanted is the story of a naive fairy princess banished by a wicked stepmother to live in modern-day New York a city crowded with eight million candidates to play Grumpy. The film begins with 12 minutes of 2-D animation the classic Disney cartoon style of Sleeping Beauty Cinderella and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Once Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) kerplops in a Times Square sewer howeverthe film turns mostly to live action. The movies big kick - what makes Enchanted live up to its title - is that the further Giselle progresses in New York the more we feel like weve tumbled into a timeless Disney Neverland. Thats because every other scene is a send-up of vintage Disney lore. For instance Giselle wakes up in the messy apartment of a Good Samaritan (single father Patrick Dempsey). Deciding to clean up she sticks her head out the window and bursts into song. Just like in Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella the wildlife surrounding our carolling princess takes note and joins in a co-ordinated royally happy work force. Only this is New York right? So instead of bunnies and bluebirds were talking scruffy rats and sooty pigeons - all scrubbing and dancing to the musical number Happy Work Song itself a knowing tribute to Snow Whites Whistle While You Work. The end of the song however is calculated to appeal to todays more cynical young Disney enthusiast. On the final note a suddenly famished pigeon turns and with the flash of its beak gobbles down its startled cockroach helper. Enchanted remains fun throughout thanks to more mischievous updates of familiar Disney scenes. Poison fruit comes in the form of a vile apple martini while the magic mirror here is a motel television that keeps Giselles fairyland rescuing committee led by the bumbling Prince Edward (James Marsden) running in endless circles. The princess meanwhile falls in true love with Dempseys skeptical modern bachelor. It isnt saying much to suggest Adams and Dempsey are improvements on the vapid fairy-tale royals who populated 1930s Disney animated films. Dempsey gracefully underplays his part getting by with a look of bemused wonder. Hes a good sport handsome as a young Cary Grant a fitting ideal for the dreamy Giselle (and every mooning princess in the audience). Adams plays Princess Giselle as an alarmingly openhearted naif. Shes not much different here than she was in her Academy Award-nominated performance in Junebug. Except she trips and stumbles a lot. The result is the klutziest most vulnerable Disney princess ever someone tweenage girls can identify with. Now onto the bad news The film obviously hoped to provide girls in the audience a surrogate in Dempseys starry-eyed daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey). Except they dont give Covey anything to do other than beam happily whenever Princess Giselle enters the room. Admirers of classic Disney animation will notice the absence of the magnificent set pieces that inspired audiences with wonder. The film tries to replicate Sleeping Beautys epic confrontation with the evil witch in gloomy Gothic Forbidden Mountain. Here the wicked stepmother (Susan Sarandon) attacks Giselle at a ball just after she loses her slipper - another reference to Cinderella. At which point Sarandon turns into a fire-breathing six-storey tall dragon lady. The special effect is disconcerting and not all that special. Its as if in the final reel nervous producers went ""Wait a minute we havent given boys anything yet; better throw in a Transformer fight scene."" Though Disneys latest trips and stumbles a few times just like Princess Giselle audiences will no doubt excuse the film its occasional lapses. Enchanted manages the trick of recasting sugar spun Disney fairy tales of old into a winning modern-day comedy. Walt Disney would be impressed especially when the first weeks box office comes in. Apparently there is still some magic left in the Magic Kingdom.

"The fairest of them all - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Susan Sarandon The fairest of them allARTS amp; ENTERTAINMENT - holiday movie reviewsEnchanted lovingly pokes fun at Disneys classic princesses and fairy-tale movie themes.November 21 2007|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticEnchanted is the best Disney fantasy-musical since Mary Poppins a hilarious dazzling send-up of the things that made Disney what it is today -- fairy-tale princesses.It features a delightful wide-eyed comic performance by Amy Adams of Junebug and another singing-dancing scene-stealing turn by James Marsden (Hairspray). This blend of animation in the classic Disney (hand-drawn) style and modern romance has wit and charm to burn.We begin as we always do ""once upon a time"" in an animated fairy-tale land called Andalasia. Thats where Giselle equal parts Snow White Cinderella Belle and Ariel sings her heart out waiting for her ""True Loves Kiss."" Her singing is so sweet that the critters of the forest come at her call helping around the house.And so does the handsome Prince Edward. He takes time off from troll hunting to sing back to her. He knows on first sight that the lovely sweet Giselle can ""complete my duet.""But the evil stepmother witch-queen (Susan Sarandon) wont hear of it. Edwards marriage will strip her of power. So she dresses up like a crone and tosses Snowy Giselle down a well. And darned if girlfriend doesnt turn up in New York.Shes utterly lost in this flesh-and-blood reality of rude people and harsh lighting. But the handsome single-dad Robert (Patrick Dempsey of Greys Anatomy) is there to help.Reluctantly. Hes a cynical divorce lawyer and hes not buying her nutball story and hes not going to help her ""find the castle."" But Robert has a little girl and you know how they are about pale princesses in hoop skirts.What follows is a delirious ""fish out of water"" romp as Giselle carves dresses for herself out of Roberts curtains and summons New Yorks ""woodland creatures"" (the rats and pigeons are merely the cuddlier ones) to help her. Her ""Happy Working Song"" does it every time.Giselle doesnt have to be animated to let her heart sing. Whats brilliant is the way jaded cynical New York sings and dances with her. The city especially Central Park has never looked so lovely.Dempsey plays the befuddlement well enough (hes actually a weak link) but Sarandon is simply perfect animated or real as the witch-queen. British character player Timothy Spall is the queens henchman and vamps through assorted scenes where he tries to talk Giselle into taking a bite out of something poisoned.An A-list of Disney animation song-writing talent did the tunes and the production numbers rival anything in Hairspray or High School Musical or for that matter Beauty and the Beast.Director Kevin Lima (Tarzan) finds the giggles in Bill Kellys ironic script commenting on referencing but gently goofing on fairy-tale characters and Disney cartoon conventions. Enchanted is also shot through with the sweetness and heart of the best Disney movies.But Adams and Marsden sell this and how. She never loses Giselles sense of wonder and confusion over a world where love isnt always ""happily ever after"" where people actually get angry. And Marsden spot-on from his bouncy Disney-prince hair to his Gaston-in-Beauty and the Beast voice and machismo just kills. Who else could describe his true love as ""my other half my one coquette my true loves duet""?Things go the way they often do in fairy tales but with the real world setting there are real world gags about this new woman in Roberts life (his fiancM-ie isnt happy about this) seeking answers from the ""magic mirror"" that gets cable. Not to mention the helpful talking chipmunk who is the only one who sees the big picture.Even the throw-away bits work. Giselle is utterly out of her depth until she sees a familiar face a very short very irritable New York businessman.""Grumpy""The messages -- that ""love at first sight"" often isnt real and chivalry can still be pretty romantic -- give Enchanted a twist that could undo the ""I need my prince to give me my voice"" brainwashing of The Little Mermaid. Heres one that is almost certain to become Disneys next classic.

"Sly princess is enchanting - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Sly princess is enchantingNovember 21 2007|By Michael Phillips Tribune movie critic""Enchanted"" is a contraption redeemed by a delightful leading performance. The world may not have needed another attempt to cash in on all things princess-y but Amy Adams per the old ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"" theme song takes a (potentially) nothing day and suddenly makes it all seem worthwhile. Like Marlo Thomas in ""That Girl"" shes diamonds daisies snowflakes chestnuts rainbows and springtime. Yes and springtime.""Enchanted"" begins as an animated tale set in the land of Andalasia. Young warbling Giselle seems all set for a happy life with Prince Edward but Edwards mother Queen Narissa doesnt like her and throws her down a magic well which is some sort of nutty portal to another world -- live-action New York City. (This isnt a film that blends animation and live action a la ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""; its more a one-or-the-other deal.) The prince played by James Marsden and a chipmunk follow her into live-action land as does the Queens confidant (Timothy Spall). So does the queen played by Susan Sarandon.Giselles protectors in New York are a cynical divorce attorney (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter (Rachel Covey). Idina Menzel who won a Tony for ""Wicked"" plays Dempseys fiance and while were on the subject of ""Wicked"" lets just say ""Enchanted"" wants in on ""Wickeds"" popularity so badly it practically drools.Director Kevin Lima (""102 Dalmations"") and screenwriter Bill Kelly reference half the Disney canon in ""Enchanted"" from ""Sleeping Beauty"" to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" In the end Sarandon (lively in a predictable role) transforms into a dragon and while I thought ""Beowulf"" was only fair the ""Beowulf"" dragon could eat the ""Enchanted"" dragon for brunch.Through good scenes and derivative ones Adams is disarming. She played the pregnant hometown girl in ""Junebug"" as well as the nurse with the braces in ""Catch Me If You Can"" and the way she combines irrepressible high spirits with slyly subversive comic wiles in ""Enchanted"" shes every Disney princess in one ebullient package.A key scene early on has Giselle singing one of the scores Alan Menken/Stephen Schwartz songs with half of New York in Central Park and it works; director Lima and the songwriters build the sequence deftly ending with a sight gag of Prince Edward getting creamed by cyclists (its in the trailer) that seals the deal.Ten years ago Adams was doing ""The Varsity Drag"" in a revival of ""Good News"" at the Chanhassen Dinner Theatre in suburban Minneapolis. She was great. Now everybody knows it.MPAA rating PG (for some scary images and mild innuendo).----------mjphillipstribune.com.- - -""Enchanted"" Director Kevin LimaScreenplay Bill KellyPhotography Don BurgessEditing Stephen A.

Ditto her film Enchanted.A cartoon princess from the fairy-tale kingdom of Andalasia Giselle falls down a well comes up a sewer and lifts a manhole cover to find herself - now made of flesh and blood - smack in the middle of Broadway. Both in the geographical and musical meanings of the word. Amid the hectic rush and rudeness of this Whole New World the pilgrim in white taffeta remains undaunted in her quest for True Loves Kiss which inspires her to song. Never mind the sourpusses in the cynicism epicenter of the universe Enchanteds princess looks for happy-ever-after and attracts a metropolis worth of converts to her cause. Rapturously played by Amy Adams Giselle will likely win over everyone from America to Andalasia. In the kitchen acidic liquids dissolve sugar. With Giselle it is the opposite. Her sweetness never cloying dissolves acidic personalities. Like that of Robert (Patrick Dempsey) the grouchy lawyer who takes in the homeless princess because his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) begs him to. Morgan is smitten with Giselle who explains that just before she was to wed to The Prince (James Marsden) she fell out of Andalasia and into New York. Giselle was in fact cursed by the Princes Evil Stepmother (Susan Sarandon underutilized and overplaying). Waltzing between animated and live-action realms Enchanted likewise waltzes between Grinches and Glindas bringing together both personality types on its polished ballroom floor. The concept is swell the execution smile-making. But the movie an iridescent bubble that ascends impervious to punctures by wrought-iron fences or prickly people soars with the helium-lightness of Adams performance. Familiar as Will Ferrells salvation in Talladega Nights and Oscar-nominated supporting actress for Junebug Adams here looks subversive because she plays it straight. A composite of every full-skirted animal-loving housecleaning Disney cartoon princess Giselle keeps a civil tongue in her head. Its the movie directed by Kevin Lima that has its tongue in cheek. In Manhattan Giselle has no woodland creatures to help her tidy Roberts grimy pad. So she summons pigeons and rats and roaches while singing a ""Happy Working Song"" that is the films highlight. The song like the movie is cheerfully gross enough to get boys - and their fathers - into theater seats for a story every tween and her mother will love. The films gentle collision of earnestness and sarcasm has the effect of charming the larks and the snarks. For those scoring at home the subtext of Enchanted is that Disney long the target of lampoons by DreamWorks Shrek franchise gets to mock itself while baiting its lampooners. To this end a big green ogre is slain in Enchanteds early scenes. Nearly as delightful as Adams is James Marsden jut-jawed and Dudley Do-Rightish as the Prince who follows Giselle down the well and up the sewer effectively completing Disneys conquest of Times Square. A squirrel named Pip a squirrely emissary from Anadalasia played by Timothy Spall and an underused Idina Menzel as Roberts fiancee round out the cast. This charmer of a film runs a little long and is heavy on the CGI dragon. The real special effect is Adams who sings the Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz songs with brio complementing her vivacious performance.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

On the other hand a self-inflicted wound can be the hardest to aim. That pretty much sums up Enchanted the animation/live-action hybrid that spoofs Cinderella Snow White Sleeping Beauty and pretty much every other Disney title you can think of. But while its shooting for the same sweet spot that made Shrek a box-office monster - an adult-worthy kid flick or vice versa - its still a Disney movie which means the satire is unfailingly friendly and it comes with a supersize side of schmaltz. Fresh off the Disney Princess assembly line Giselle lives in the forest with an assortment of talking critters that look a lot like the gang from Bambi. One day she meets handsome Prince Edward but before they can get married and live happily ever after the evil Queen Narissa makes a pre-emptive strike against her presumed rival to the throne by shoving the fair maiden down a magic well. At the bottom is Manhattan. Climbing out of a manhole cover in Times Square Giselle is now a real live girl (Amy Adams) in a wedding gown the size of a Hyundai. A fairy-tale innocent lost in the city she wanders in search of the castle until she bumps into Robert (Patrick Dempsey) an uptight single father with a heart in need of healing. Its not hard to guess where this is heading but first our charming prince must charge to the rescue. Now sporting the wavy locks and vacant-stare vanity of James Marsden (Cyclops in the X-Men movies) hes accompanied by a chipmunk named Pip and a portly attendant whos secretly an agent of the queen. The latter is played to humorous effect by Timothy Spall best known as the treacherous wizard Peter Pettigrew in Harry Potter. Unlike the hapless young lovers he seems perfectly at home in the real world. To trick Giselle into eating a poisoned apple he disguises himself as various immigrant stereotypes including an Italian waiter at a restaurant called Bella Notte. Thats from Lady and the Tramp of course one of the subtler self-references Disney has packed into the movie. The most entertaining though are the unsubtle ones. For example while the live-action chipmunk loses the power of speech Giselles singing voice retains its magical sway over animals. Since Bambi and Thumper are unavailable its an army of pigeons rats and cockroaches that answers her call to clean up Roberts apartment in the funniest - and grossest - set piece in the film. (The princess pied-piper powers also apply to street musicians which makes for a hilarious sing- and dance-along in Central Park.) In her highest-profile part to date Adams is winsome as Giselle although her double duty as romantic lead means that Marsden carries more comic weight as the ditzy prince. However straight man Dempsey - Dr. McDreamy on Greys Anatomy - is just plain dull. This personality split is whats wrong with Enchanted. When its funny its good. But when it takes a turn for the heartwarming it feels more like a Disney knockoff than a send-up. That criticism extends to the animation which uses retro styling as an excuse for flat unimaginative visuals (except for a pop-up storybook effect which is actually pretty cool). Despite A-list talent ranging from narrator Julie Andrews to composer Alan Menken the overall quality looks more like the B-team. Come to think of it maybe this spoof hits its target a little harder than intended. Reach the reporter at kerry .lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

"Princess Power washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Princess Power Network News X Profile View More Activity Play Video TRAILER | Enchanted TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday November 21 2007 Early in ""Enchanted"" Disneys good-natured attempt at some satiric jujitsu divorce lawyer Robert Phillip (Patrick Dempsey) gives his 6-year-old daughter a book about female heroes. When they come to Marie Curie he extols her dedication to science and contributions to public health until admitting lamely that she wound up dying from radiation poisoning. Such are the invidious choices that ""Enchanted"" sets up and eventually resolves for women who in this clever and mostly charming holiday comedy win by getting to be both achievers and princesses. As that rare family movie that really will appeal to the whole family ""Enchanted"" also finds the Disney empire celebrating the classic princess genre it virtually invented while simultaneously sending up its most saccharine cliches. After enduring merciless skewering at the hands of former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg in ""Shrek"" its a little late for preemption but the studio deserves points for some healthy self-parody nonetheless. ""Enchanted"" opens with a lovely animated sequence reminiscent of such vintage classics as ""Snow White"" and ""Cinderella"" in which a beautiful and kind peasant girl named Giselle pines for her handsome prince while a menagerie of woodland creatures looks on adoringly. When her prince finally does come the wedding is scheduled for the very next day that is until his evil stepmother plots to have Giselle banished from her erstwhile kingdom. And what better purgatory than a place where as the stepmother puts it ""there are no happily ever afters""? By which she means of course modern-day Manhattan. Its at this point that ""Enchanted"" switches from cartoon to live action with the altogether convincing Amy Adams taking on the role of a bewildered would-be princess decked out in an impossibly poufy wedding dress. Scenes of the wide-eyed innocent Giselle mistaking a businessman of short stature for a dwarf (""Grumpy"" she cries delightedly as he scowls back at her) while she navigates the elbows-out crowd in Times Square set up an amusing and original fish-out-of-water conceit in which the perennial princess craze among little girls is given a road test in an all-too-real world. The narrative tension if that isnt too highfalutin a term for such a lighthearted spoof comes when Giselle meets Robert who from personal and professional experience has become cynical in the ways of love. Hes about to propose to his hard-charging fiancee (played by the fabulous Idina Menzel in a thankless role) and Giselles natterings about true love are only pulling him dangerously off message. Meanwhile Giselles own brave but hopelessly dim prince (James Marsden) has come to Manhattan to save her with a computer-generated chipmunk in tow to provide one of the films cutest set pieces. In some ways ""Enchanted"" is chock-full of such show-stopping scenes especially some wonderful musical numbers written by Disney house composers Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. If the chirpily retro ""Happy Working Song"" which features a chorus of New York City rats pigeons and cockroaches is too creepy-crawly for some squeamish viewers they will surely be transported by the movies big production number ""Thats How You Know"" a lavishly staged love song featuring a colorful cast of 150 singers and dancers in Central Park. In a nifty twist some of the real-life voices behind Disneys animated heroines appear in supporting roles in ""Enchanted"" including Jodi Benson a.k.a. The Little Mermaid as a law firm receptionist. All of this is given surprisingly uneven direction at the hands of Kevin Lima (""102 Dalmatians"" ""Tarzan"") who has taken product placement to new lows (""Enchanted"" might as well have a continuous ticker shouting ""Use Verizon Drink Coca-Cola Eat at Planet Hollywood"") and who too often seems to settle for less-than-spectacular production values. Susan Sarandon has grounds for a lawsuit for the unflattering camera angles Lima uses to film her dramatic third-act appearance as the wicked stepmother. When Sarandon appears ""Enchanted"" briefly goes off the rails as the filmmakers pack in perhaps one-too-many references to ""Snow White"" ""Sleeping Beauty"" and . . . ""King Kong""? No matter. This is an altogether winning piece of escapism in large part due to the stunning Adams who here gets the breakout role shes long deserved. Best known for her Oscar-nominated performance in the 2005 independent film ""Junebug"" Adams flawlessly embodies the part of a sincere-but-spunky princess (her delivery of the simple line ""and ever?"" is just one genuinely heartbreaking example). Dont be fooled by the delicate doll-like looks In ""Enchanted"" she delivers a subtle and even powerful performance in this case as a young woman in the throes of discovering her true heretofore repressed emotional nature. But thats just the subtext to a story that is dominated less by sarcasm than by sweetness light and love. At first blush ""Enchanted"" looks and feels like it buys into princess culture with its frills and furbelows but its real cake-and-eat-it idea of a happy ending is to be a princess and a successful career woman. Depending on your point of view thats either progress or just another fairy tale to be debunked in another movie but for now Marie Curie in pink tulle anyone? Enchanted (107 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some scary images and mild innuendo.

A full-blown musical that commutes between Disneys patented cartoon universe and the ""real"" world with cleverness and grace this splashy production reminds one of nothing in the Disney canon so much as ""Mary Poppins"" not least due to the ""star is born"" aura that surrounds Amy Adams here just as it did Julie Andrews 43 years ago. ""Enchanted"" more than lives up to its title. A full-blown musical that commutes between Disneys patented cartoon universe and the ""real"" world with cleverness and grace this splashy production reminds one of nothing in the Disney canon so much as ""Mary Poppins"" not least due to the ""star is born"" aura that surrounds Amy Adams here just as it did Julie Andrews 43 years ago. Comparison between the two films will certainly extend to their popularity as the new one will please nearly all audiences all the time on its flight to the place where B.O. dreams come true. The central conceit of Bill Kellys nifty script is to toss Disneys trustiest fairy tale characters -- the sweet-as-sugar princess the straight-arrow prince the evil queen and a menagerie of affectionately frisky critters -- from their bucolic natural setting onto the streets of Manhattan and take it from there. This being ""New"" York the characters arent in danger of being plunked down in the middle of ""Mean Streets"" or ""Across 110th Street""; indeed when they pop out of a manhole in the middle of the theater district accoutered in flouncy medieval garb its a wonder the many gawking bystanders dont just assume theyre refugees from a Disney Broadway production which ""Enchanted"" is sure to become down the line. Opening 12 minutes which are delightfully animated in vintage hand-drawn style set the tone of loving send-up by packing in as many of the old Disney cliches as possible. In Andalasia a land clearly afflicted by severe animal over-population the ditzily innocent Giselle sings of the ""True Loves Kiss"" she expects to receive from the soon-to-arrive Prince Edward son of Queen Narissa. Unwilling to be dethroned if Edward marries Narissa transforms herself into a dreadful old crone and pushes Giselle down a well sending her to a place ""where there are no happily-ever-afters."" Confronting the noise and concrete and congestion of Manhattan wide-eyed Giselle (Adams) arrives clueless not to mention penniless. Dithering around town in an absurdly hooped wedding dress she winds up rain soaked in the Bowery where she attracts the attention of 6-year-old Morgan (Rachel Covey). Latters divorced dad Robert (Patrick Dempsey) a divorce lawyer himself rescues the damsel in distress and lets her spend the night at their apartment albeit with misgivings as hes about to ask his g.f. Nancy (Idina Menzel) to marry him. As the gee-whiz fish-out-of-water reactions of an animation-world alien cant sustain interest for too long pic quickly shows what its got up its sleeve in a hilarious variation on ""Whistle While You Work"" called ""Happy Working Song."" Confronting the horrible mess of Roberts domicile in the morning Giselle summons the citys animals to help her tidy it up and the place is soon jammed with wonderfully rendered CGI pigeons rats mice and cockroaches which enthusiastically whip the place into shape. In short order vainglorious Prince Edward (James Marsden) arrives in Manhattan sword in hand to rescue his beloved followed by Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) the queens portly factotum who comically bungles any number of attempts to eliminate Giselle once and for all. Another Andalasian transplant is a hyperactive chipmunk who keeps trying and failing to communicate to Edward what he ought to do. As Giselle initially persists in speaking in storybook homilies about her prince and true love its no wonder Robert remarks ""Its like you escaped from a Hallmark card."" Despite the adversity of her situation its all sweetness and light to her until Robert provokes her by insisting no fairy-tale prince will be coming to rescue her. Roused to anger for the first time in her life Giselle begins to become a real more dimensional person a development soon complicated by the stirring of feelings between her and Robert. While Kellys script and Kevin Limas direction may not rep the last word in brilliance the creative forces behind the film are uniformly alert cheeky and smart in the ways of popular entertainment. More than Disneys strictly animated product ""Enchanted"" in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the 60s is a film aimed at the entire population -- niches be damned. It simply aims to please without pandering without vulgarity without sops to pop-culture fads and to pull this off today is no small feat. But even with all the other pieces in place -- the knowing craftsmanship Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartzs engaging songs (there are five original tunes) the sharp animation the spiffy Gotham locations and a couple outrageously unexpected animal gags -- the picture wouldnt be what it is without Adams. Just as Andrews arrived at just the right time for ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"" so has Adams turned up almost out of nowhere (her wonderful work in ""Junebug"" notwithstanding) to be crowned the fairest in the land. (In a nice if fleeting touch Andrews was recruited to provide brief opening and closing narration.) With the evident instincts of a born musical-comedy performer and a lovely voice to back them up the red-haired bright-eyed Adams proves more charming the more disheveled she becomes and exercises comic gifts in the process that call to mind such immortals as Carole Lombard and Lucille Ball. An utterly convincing spokeswoman for innocence her Giselle for a long time brooks no dissent from her innately optimistic worldview so when she blossoms into a real woman if such she can be called the opening of emotional dimensions is palpable. Enchanting is the word. Prominently back on the bigscreen again due to his success in TVs ""Greys Anatomy"" Dempsey does a nice understated job as a harried single dad you dont mind pulling for. Marsden who like Adams boasts a startlingly good singing voice has and imparts a grand time as the self-regarding prince while Susan Sarandon turns up in fully cranked Cruella de Vil mode when the queen comes to New York herself to dispatch Giselle once and for all; Rick Bakers old-hag makeup for her climactic disguise is flat-out great. The skillfully produced and mounted picture makes massive use of Manhattan as a glorious backdrop; it may be a touristic view of the city but this is perhaps fitting given that its about visitors. The extensive scenes involving countless cars and extras must have tied up traffic for days and the logistics surrounding other scenes on the Brooklyn Bridge the Upper West Side Columbus Circle and elsewhere had to have been nearly as daunting. Most striking however is a prolonged production number ""Thats How You Know"" that moves through many sections of Central Park and employs dozens or more musicians dancers and backgrounders. Its hard to think of a traditional musical number done on such a scale since the 60s so its startling to behold. Like the rest of the film the sequence reaches far back into the past for its inspiration and manages to make it feel like something new again.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> You might want to remember the name Amy Adams. Its star-is-born time for the Colorado Mormon who won a supporting-actress Oscar nomination for 2005s Junebug which few saw (dumb move). Enchanted has the makings of a supersize sugarcoated hit and Adams is just the spicy princess you want to take home and PG-love. Not since Julie Andrews rode an umbrella to glory in Mary Poppins has Disney given us such a real-life doll. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Actually Adams Giselle ts off as a cartoon a princess who finds her prince (James Marsden) only to have his bitch-queen mother (Susan Sarandon) banish her to hell. That would be Times Square where the characters take on flesh and blood. OK its corny. Script contrivance thy name is having Giselle take refuge in the Manhattan apartment of a McDreamy divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) and his young daughter (Rachel Covey) which really irks -- they dont say ""pisses off"" in family films -- his girlfriend (Idina Menzel). But Enchanted makes magic when Giselle who also looks yummy in just a towel redecorates his digs with the help of rats pigeons and roaches. The terrific score is from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. And X-Man Marsden (so good in Hairspray) is a hoot as the song-and-dance-man prince. Yet Adams is the wish your heart makes when you want a storybook princess for the ages. Shes wicked good. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.
