Credit BBC/Hartswood Films for Masterpiece Crime hasnt disappeared from England as a result of Sherlock Holmess 21st-century efforts; it has merely become irrelevant.Benedict Cumberbatch who is back for a new season as Holmes on Sunday on PBSs ""Masterpiece Mystery"" is getting so good at his quirky portrayal that the crimes Holmes is solving are a secondary concern. Mr. Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Watson are just plain enjoyable to watch. Its all about repartee for these two; theirs is quick and sharp and often comes at the most incongruous moments. In the ""Sherlock"" season premiere Watson is giving the absent Holmes a view of a crime scene via video hookup but Holmes is proving to be just as annoying on a laptop as he is in person.""There is a mute button"" Watson warns him ""and I will use it.""The episode ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" is inspired by ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" from Arthur Conan Doyles original Holmes stories and like that tale involves incriminating photographic evidence. Here though Irene Adler fetchingly played by Lara Pulver is in the business of providing ""recreational scolding"" as Steven Moffats witty script puts it. That is shes a dominatrix.She gives Holmes an eyeful in their first meeting and he is smitten. Or is he?The second episode gives ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" a genetic-engineering angle but again its the little flourishes rather than the crimes that make the show so watchable. Holmes is even more tightly wound than usual because hes trying to quit his cigarette habit. In one hilarious scene he orders a baffled fellow he is interviewing to smoke while theyre talking so he can get the secondhand fumes.The series continues to draw Holmes and Watson into the Internet age with blogging text messaging and such. Sundays episode hinges on cracking the password for a smartphone. Sometimes this focus on technology feels a bit heavy-handed but in general this is a series that seems to be growing more assured as it goes along. Masterpiece Mystery Sherlock Series 2 On PBS stations on Sunday nights at 9 (check local listings). Produced by Hartswood Films and Masterpiece for BBC Wales. Created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss inspired by the works of Arthur Conan Doyle; written by Mr. Moffat (""A Scandal in Belgravia"") and Mr. Gatiss (""The Hounds of Baskerville""); directed by Paul McGuigan; Beryl Vertue Mr. Gatiss and Mr. Moffat executive producers; Rebecca Eaton executive producer for Masterpiece on PBS; Sue Vertue series producer. WITH Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock Holmes) Martin Freeman (Dr. John Watson) Lara Pulver (Irene Adler) and Andrew Scott (Jim Moriarty).

Detective work with some occasional fisticuffs and gunplay thrown in may be all well and good for people who still actually read books one imagines Ritchie thinking ... but to make Holmes relevant to 21st century audiences there has to be post-""Matrix"" slo-mo sequences devoted to kung fu and/or heavy artillery interspersed with constant cacophony and occasional gadding about. Sadly the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" was a hit despite the fact that Ritchies big-screen interpretation of the legendary sleuth resembles Conan Doyles creation as much as the hero of the low-budget thriller ""Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter"" calls to mind the protagonist of the New Testament. There are moments when it feels like ""A Game of Shadows"" is getting Holmes right only its Mycroft and not Sherlock -- the titular gumshoes brother is played by Stephen Fry whose periodic appearances in the movie feel like a wonderful visit from someone whos actually read the books. Would that this film were about Mycroft then and not the man he calls ""Sherlie."" Robert Downey Jr. returns as the detail-oriented socially awkward detective who has begun piecing together the far-flung threads of a conspiracy being woven by the nefarious Professor Moriarity (Jared Harris). The dastardly professor has turned himself into a one-man military-industrial complex setting out to do what all military-industrial complexes do Start a war so that the cash will come rolling in. Moriarity proves himself to be a formidable foe for Holmes quickly dispatching Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) -- admittedly one of the films smartest moves is getting rid of this character in a hurry -- and sending his goons to kill Dr. Watson (Jude Law) and his new bride Mary (Kelly Reilly) as they attempt to honeymoon in Brighton. Holmes and Watson aided by a Romany fortune-teller (Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and its sequels) pursue Moriarity to the edge of Reichenbach Falls in an attempt to prevent the academic from starting World War I several decades early. In its favor ""Game of Shadows"" gives us a sinister plot thats a notch or two smarter than most of the schemes hatched by 007s nemeses (even if it feels all too familiar) and there are occasional moments when Ritchie has fun with period spectacle whether its a roomful of waltzing diplomats or an elaborately-staged production of ""Don Giovanni"" at the Paris Opera. If only the CG-heavy evocations of 1891 London or the dwelled-upon internal mechanics of firearms had the heft or the simplicity of those opera singers dressed up like singing statues or devilish minions -- time and again the film assaults the eyes with cartoonish visual trickery and deflates the story with its obvious artificiality. (A game of shadows indeed.) When the film slows down enough to let us enjoy the interplay between its talented cast members or to allow us to pick up on little clues along the way that let us attempt to join Holmes in solving the mystery this new ""Sherlock Holmes"" offers moments of vitality that are all too quickly crushed by the next exploding set piece. Two hours of Downey and Harris sparring over a chessboard would have provided many more thrills but neither Ritchie nor the suits at Warner Bros. would have any idea how to make or market a Sherlock Holmes movie featuring the actual character rather than some pipe-smoking 19th century James Bond with a weakness for coca leaves and jiu jitsu.

"Sherlock Holmes review Crime-fighting duo shines in sequel - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Arthur Conan DoyleSherlock Holmes review Crime-fighting duo shines in sequelIn A Game of Shadows Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law benefit from crackling dialogue by Michele and Kieran Mulroney and from Guy Ritchies direction.December 16 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Is ""Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows"" the ultimate disguise? Have they simply reimagined the legendary sleuth as a sort of grand mash-up of Eddie Izzard and the Terminator which not only endows him with substantial brain and brawn but some very interesting wardrobe choices? After the box-office success of 2009s ""Sherlock Holmes"" you knew the filmmakers would be pressed to find a way to up the ante. Nonstop action a possible world war and cross-dressing are indeed the answer. Thats not altogether a bad decision with ""A Game of Shadows"" a few shades brighter than its predecessor and the action bits certainly closer to the full-throttle ""Lock Stock amp; Two Smoking Barrels"" mode director Guy Ritchie didnt quite capture the first time. In ""A Game of Shadows"" with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law energetically reprising their roles as Holmes and Watson the filmmakers have in a sense gotten both closer to and farther away from the original figment of Arthur Conan Doyles vivid imagination. Theyve gone bonkers with the disguises taking them to extremes that are at times so absurd a and so transparent a its impossible not to laugh. But watching the mental gears turn as Holmes works toward solving the crimes in question well they could have used quite a bit more grease."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt; It is still the world of the late 1800s though the mystery to be solved is very au courant with bombs exploding in public places suspicious deaths of well-placed moguls peace talks disrupted and munitions buildups underway across Europe. The films married screenwriting team Michele and Kieran Mulroney keep the dialogue crackling so smartly at times that you sorely miss it when it doesnt which happens slightly too often during the 2-hour plus running time. As the film opens Watson is paying a visit to his occasional partner in solving crimes. His wedding to Mary (Kelly Reilly) is fast approaching and Holmes is to be his best man. The intrigues begin in earnest with the bachelor party Holmes throws at an eccentric gentlemans club in which none of Dr. Watsons pals show up but two new characters do a a very wry Stephen Fry as Holmes brother Mycroft and a Gypsy fortuneteller Madam Simza Heron played by Noomi Rapace. Holmes has had a chance encounter (or was it) with the lovely Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) who seemed clearly over her head in something that involves Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris the age-old nemesis but newly arrived to the films and as dapper as he is in ""Mad Men""). Now Madam Simza seems to be tied up in Moriartys schemes too. Underground arms deals an international political conflagration the fate of Simzas brother and Watsons wedding hang in the balance. You know which of those Holmes will choose to focus on. Indeed Mary and Dr. John have barely said their ""I dos"" before speeding trains speeding bullets major arms movements and complex action sequences overtake things. Its all done to hair-raising and in the case of a meat-hook late in the film to ""Hellraiser"" effect. As if to reassure us that Holmes is still a thinking man the filmmakers have him giving a lot of thought to the action doing a better job this time around deconstructing his fights in his mind and in slow motion before they unfold in real time. Its a great effect but like much else in the movie overused. The new character additions are a draw. If you bother casting the terrific Rapace who starred in the Swedish version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" for heavens sakes give her something substantial to do. They dont. On the other hand the multi-talented Fry turns out to be smashing as Holmes quirky older brother. Though the action is gripping and a treat to watch much of the visual punch of the film is due to the outstanding work by production designer Sarah Greenwood and costume designer Jenny Beavan. Theyve created the times in rich detail then its all been aged nicely with just a hint of patina. Through cinematographer Philippe Rousselots lens the palette on which Holmes and Watson and Moriarty play this deadly game becomes simply splendid."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; Still in Law and Downey the filmmakers have a pair of blokes who make the most of what theyre given. Laws down-to-earth and slightly fussy Watson proves once again to be the right counterweight to Downeys flighty fidgety flinty Holmes. As Johnny Depp has done so brilliantly with his devilish Jack Sparrow Downey has made this sly sardonic Sherlock stylistically all his own.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 23 2009 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Warner Bros. Pictures Robert Downey Jr. left and Rachel McAdams are shown in a scene from Sherlock Holmes. Alex Bailey/Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""Sherlock Holmes"" Robert Downey Jr. plays the famous Sir Arthur Conan Doyle detective as a kind of kung fu Ratso Rizzo. This is certainly the grubbiest Holmes in movie history. When not slumming in the streets hes duking it out in the squalid East End as a bare-chested combatant in scenes resembling outtakes from ""Fight Club."" What was the thinking behind all this? Was producer Joel Silver director Guy Ritchie and Ritchies team of screenwriters worried that young male audiences wouldnt warm to a hero who valued brains over brawn? If so they overcorrected to put it mildly. Downey is a combustible one-of-a-kind actor who deserves better than this crunch-and-thud bid for a new movie brand. The ""Iron Man"" brand is quite enough. Jude Law plays a debonair Dr. Watson and Rachel McAdams is wasted as a master criminal who gets the best of Holmes. It all has something to do with the plot of mad Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) to take over the world but the real villain Moriarty is waiting in the wings. With any luck the plot to launch a new franchise will fail and hell be waiting forever.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""Sherlock Holmes"" Robert Downey Jr. never utters ""my dear Watson."" But the warm sentiment is implied throughout Guy Ritchies fleet and brooding buddy adventure set in late-Victorian England. London is grime crime and scaffolding. The London Bridge is in mid- construction. Laborers build massive ships on the piers of the Thames. Thugs stick up citizens in alleys. (Or in the case of one capable lass they try to.) All grays browns and soot the city has the flavor of industrious expansion with a full ladle of brute lawlessness. A ritual killer has already sacrificed five women upon the altar of his dark ambitions when Londons publicity-modest ace detective Sherlock Holmes (Downey) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) nab him. The murderer turns out to be Lord Blackwell (Mark Strong). Ritchie the director of the brawling breakneck imports ""Snatch"" and ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" shoots Blackwells capture and the clashes to follow with a heady cocktail of the accelerated and the slo-mo. Combat is fast and furious then lingers. The face of one of Holmes boxing opponents -- the detective is a bare-knuckled pugilist -- suggests G-force distortion. Everyone on set (and editor James Herbert) took their directors call for ""action"" to heart. This is not your grandparents or even your parents Holmes. Vim and vigor have been restored to Sir Arthur Conan Doyles famously cerebral master of deduction. Thanks to TVs ""Monk"" ""Psych"" and ""The Mentalist"" Holmes powers of observation might seem less than singular. Hardly ho-hum however is the chemistry between the scruffily dashing Holmes and his reserved partner-in-crime-fighting Dr. John Watson. Quite handsome with a mustache Law is smashing as the good doctor. A veteran of the Afghan war this Watson is no slouch in the thinking and combat departments. Theres some kick -- but none of the flustered sidekick -- to Watson. This doesnt mean Holmes wont enlist the services of his reluctant friend. About to pop the question to his beloved Mary (Kelly Reilly) Watson is putting an end to his and Holmes domestic partnership. Its an arrangement that has the doc apologizing for the mayhem his brooding friend engages. Ritchie has a deservedly grand reputation for bloke camaraderie. Even a lesser romp like last years ""RocknRolla"" is a pleasure of knowing masculinity. Pity hes not as exceptional when it comes to womenfolk. Rachel McAdams is porcelain-pretty but unconvincing as American fatale Irene Adler. More interesting is Reillys turn as the understandably curt Mary. Holmes love interest qua nemesis arrives in a dress accented with almost the only color in the film and asks the detectives help in finding a man linked to her mysterious benefactor and the resurrected Blackwell. Downey has called the denizen of 221B Baker Street an early superhero. He should know. Ever since the actor trained for his role as Tony Stark he looks like he could compete in the ""Ironman"" triathalon. In early scenes Holmes acutely visualizes the outcome of his actions voicing them aloud then executing them. Its a clever if overly self-conscious trick. Caught sentenced executed Blackwell presents quite the conundrum for all concerned when he returns from the dead. Has Holmes crossed into Harry Potter territory? Has the villain gained supernatural powers before the hero? The movie keeps us guessing. There are at least three extended clashes. One humorously pits Holmes against a giant of a Frenchman. The filmmakers even find a way to include a version of comedys most recent weapon of choice a Taser. Its spirited nonsense. Given Downeys gift for agile delivery the screenplay isnt as spry as wed hoped. Eddie Marsan does promising work as the one-upped but not wholly rancorous Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard. Theres a secret society of powerful men. And theres a plan for world domination. And we never see the face of Irenes dark patron. Yet its all knotted together then unraveled with brio by Holmes and Watson. There are fisticuffs galore fiery combustion aplenty and yes my dear reader clever deduction.

Comments (12) click to enlarge Sherlock Holmes Rated PG-13  128 minutes  2009 Arthur Conan Doyles master detective became one of the great heroes in genre fiction precisely because he was so freakish cold and methodical Holmes was the dark underbelly of Victorian rationalism his intellect so overdeveloped that he couldnt relate to anyone. The very idea of handing him over to professional lad Guy Ritchie (who directed Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) to be played as a punch-throwing quipster by Robert Downey Jr. is so profoundly stupid one can only step back in dismay. The plot of this thudding blockbuster involves a satanic priest (Mark Strong) scheming to conquer the UK and it gives Holmes and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) ample opportunity to bust out their street-fighting skills. Rachel McAdams shows up as Irene Adler the woman who outfoxed Holmes in ""A Scandal in Bohemia""; here she gets the better of him by drugging his wine and handcuffing him to a bed nude for the maid to find.

""Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows is as merry a forced march as sequels get and it has its pleasures chief among them Robert Downey Jr. But the light has gone from the stars eyes and the thrill is gone from this franchise. It and he are brands that need protecting and so we have a movie that keeps selling itself long after the sale has been made.Guy Ritchie is back in the directors chair which means that macho men will banter lovingly and the camera will climb the walls like a speed freak. The first installment back in 2009 reinvented Arthur Conan Doyles legendary detective as - well as a Victorian-era Robert Downey Jr. This Holmes was debauched and much smarter than you or me but also antic with his own genius unexpectedly athletic and aware of the silliness he has to wade through. Irony is a gift Downey likes to share with audiences - its a survivors irony now less glib than it was before his troubles with drugs and the law - and his casting as Holmes seemed like a rare dovetailing of part and persona. More than Iron Man Holmes seems like Downeys idea of a superhero.You can tell the stars just the least bit bored though even if he plays it as Holmess boredom. ""Game of Shadows introduces the heros great nemesis the ""Napoleon of crime professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) and because we expect bigness from our seasonal blockbusters the villains plans involve maximum munitions and other things that go boom. The scenes between Downey and Harris are the films sharpest; they click with the agility of intelligent actors playing brilliant rivals.By contrast Jude Laws Dr. Watson - a muscular playmate rather than the mens club duffer of classic Hollywood - is relatively marooned this time out. An early sequence in which Holmes and a Cossack assassin battle each other around the balconies of a London pleasure palace represents an energetic use of parkour in a steampunk setting but Laws stuck on the sidelines. Later he gets to fire a Really Big Gun as if to make up for the affront to his manhood.(And if Law has little to do what about poor Noomi Rapace in the nothing role of a gypsy fortune teller who helps the duo? This is what the star of the Swedish version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo gets for her breakout performance a part as a Victorian-era Bond girl.)The laborious plot involves Moriarty working hard to jump-start World War I some 25 years ahead of schedule but as expected its the verbal and visual fripperies that stick - Holmes disguising himself as a sofa say or Downeys way with the phrase ""a glorious hedgehog goulash. Every so often the blessed Stephen Fry wafts through as Sherlocks pear-shaped brother Mycroft mostly useless occasionally nude always welcome.Hes the only free spirit in a movie that feels deadlocked and soulless even as it works overtime to entertain. ""Game of Shadows uses the bullet-time/freeze-frame effect so often that the movie threatens to turn into a screensaver and the relationship between the two leads is pregnant with locker-room homoeroticism even before Holmes dresses in drag and lies on top of Watson. At times the scenes grind to a halt and the characters just stand there the hollowness of the whole enterprise revealed.For all that the conceit of Holmes pre-visualizing his punches and scissor-kicks remains a neat trick. The final 15 minutes of ""Game of Shadows take the idea to its outer limits as Holmes and Moriarty bark chess moves at each other and wage hand-to-hand combat in their minds. Its an enjoyably demented meta-finale the rivals showing what they could do if they ever bothered to actually do it.And Downey still brings an appealing weariness to Holmess compulsive noticing noticing noticing. ""What do you see? the gypsy girl asks him. ""Everything Holmes replies. ""That is my curse. If Downey has a curse itll be called ""Sherlock Holmes 3.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Nasty Boys Robert Downey Jr. brightens a grim Sherlock; Michael Hanekes White Ribbon is just a grind. _ By David Edelstein Published Dec 28 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Given that Guy Ritchies Sherlock Holmes turns the great sleuth (Robert Downey Jr.) and his sidekick Dr. Watson (Jude Law) into the boxing and martial-arts champions of London the movie is surprisingly bearable. Its overlong and skitters around for a good 45 minutes before a plot kicks in but Ritchie adds fillips of style to the incessant fightshe might have made a good director for the flop The Avengers picture. Having Holmes battle a villain who might or might not have supernatural powers actually conjures up the world of Arthur Conan Doyle who in real life had too much faith in his five senses which made him an easy mark for tricksters. The only reason to see it is Downey No one in film is more likable when playing dislikable people. When not on a case his Holmes is not merely a depressive but a nasty dissolute hollow-eyed slob with a compulsion to test sedating drugs on his hapless pooch. Laws drab Watson appears to be disgusted by himto the point where the mystery is how he could have ever become Holmess friend let alone the detectives Boswell. But Downeys boy-king spirit shines through. That spirit isnt Holmesian (not much kickboxing in Conan Doyle) but by now weve seen so many good bad and indifferent Sherlocks that its almost a relief to get something different however wrongheaded. And theres no such thing as too much Downey. With The White Ribbon the German director Michael Haneke follows Lars von Trier (Antichrist) in borrowing a serviceable horror-movie premise gussying it up for the international festival crowd and passing off its sclerotic insights as harsh new truths about the essential evil of man (and woman and child). Von Trier wallowed in psychodrama and metaphysics (and gore) but Haneke has a social agenda. His brow lifted higher than usual he attempts to depict the festering psyche of the Germans on the brink of World War I. The movie plays like an Ingmar Bergman remake of the little-kids-from-space picture Village of the Damnedexcept if Bergman had made it he might have set out to discover something he didnt already know. Hanekes contempt for humanity had congealed into dogma before he shot his first frame of film. The movie is a long 144 minutes. Hanekes setting is a small village rocked by acts of malevolence. A doctor and his poor horse connect with a trip wire. A farmers wife working for the towns chief landowner a baron falls through a hole in the floorshortly after which the barons little son is found strung up and lashed with a note that says the sins of the father will be visited on the child. Who could be responsible for such acts? The ingenuous male schoolteacher (who relays the story of the village as an old man) notices a group of children led by an obsequiously angelic blonde girl and her guilty-looking brother as they troop down the street to ascertain the condition of the latest victim. By and by the blonde gazes with disgust on a boy with Down syndromeclearly an inferior specimen. The teacher sees the brother balancing over a precipice The boy says hes giving God a chance to kill him for crimes unspecified. As in the revenge-of-the-repressed quasi mystery Cache Haneke doesnt deign to deliver the genre goodsresolution catharsis etc. That way he can crudely spell out his themes and yet still give the bourgeois audience the finger. Haneke depicts the whole village as morally corroded economic exploitation incest corporal punishment of kids hypocrisy too. The title refers to the white ribbon the minister ties to his eldest daughter to remind her of innocence and purity. Later he binds his elder son to the bed to keep the boy from masturbating. Few can resist abusing power Its a virus. And we know where its leading to blind obedience collective madness fascism. Somewhere along the way the director made the leap from generalized sadism (Bennys Video and Funny Gamesso not nice he made it twice) to political indictments (Cache). But his basic sadistic impulse never evolved. Christian Berger has shot The White Ribbon in stark black and white in imitation of Sven Nykvists work in early Bergman. Its striking. But Bergman pared down the frame to allow us to scrutinize his actors emotions while Hanekes faces are (Scandinavian-looking) masks. Chill to the core he presents human cruelty not to make us empathize with the victims or understand the oppressors but to rub our noses in the crimes of our species. He thinks hes held on to the subversive ideals of punk but all I smell is skunk. Now we know James Camerons Avatar is not a brontosaurean folly but a mighty ode to Gigantism and Awesomeness. Yes its also a populist crock an attempt to rewrite (and reanimate) history with a barely disguised lefty parable of Native Americans versus capitalist imperialists whod drive them from ancestral landsaided by an imperialist (a marine) who has gone native. In this case going native means turning computer-generated. In 1999 The Matrix boasted a hero who learned that his world and body were an illusion and struggled to return to the real. A decade on the hero says Out there is the true world. In herehis ship his human bodyis the dream I dont know who I am. Who he is of course is a born-again Injun in the mode of the hero of A Man Called Horse. And so he fights for the true the pure the primitive against the poisonous forces of technologyall made possible by Camerons technological wizardry. The problem until now with CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) is that it didnt make the final perceptual leap. It was impressive rather than immersive. But Cameron moves the boundary posts. Beyond his motion-capture gizmos he has an old-fashioned command of composition strong foregrounds and layers of texture and movement reaching back into the frame and down to the teeniest pixel. On the moon Pandora he creates a living ecosystemand You (and Your 3-D Glasses) Are There. With its bioluminescent landscape this moon is alive spiritually connected at the roots bound together by a kind of Over-Soul. And damned if thats not what the technologyand its true deity whose initials are coincidentally J.C.evokes. Pantheism Cameronism In Avatar whats the diff? Now hes king of a world he made from scratch. Sherlock Holmes Directed by Guy Ritchie. Warner Bros. Pictures. PG-13. The White Ribbon Directed by Michael Haneke. Sony Pictures Classics. R.

Sherlock Holmes Good Director Guy Ritchie. Cast Robert Downey Jr. Jude Law Rachel McAdams. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some startling images and a scene of suggestive material. RELATED Guy Ritchie hopes hard work pays off with Holmes Qamp;A Robert Downey Jr. Spotlight Robert Downey Jr. Spotlight Rachel McAdams Adventure movies But the thought of him playing Sherlock Holmes was enough to give even the biggest Downey fan pause. British brilliant all that? Could he pull it off? Turns out there was no need to worry. Playing literatures greatest detective as a sort of self-loathing action hero Downey has an absolute blast. And thanks to his performance in ""Sherlock Holmes"" so do we. Mind you those who are put off by a depiction of Holmes as the sort of fellow who indulges in underground bare-knuckle boxing (he thinks that through as much as he does anything else) will have much to be put off by. Although this may be closer to Arthur Conan Doyles original depiction of Holmes audiences used to Basil Rathbone-like portrayals will be jarred. This is a rock-and-roll Holmes without the attendant music. In director Guy Ritchies telling Holmes still is off-the-charts brilliant. Hes just a butt-kicker to boot. Dr. Watson (Jude Law) also knows his way around a fight. Theyre a version of a 19th-century dynamic duo something that also may prove unsettling to fans of previous movies; Nigel Bruce Watson to Rathbones Holmes in such films as ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" was more likely to take a punch than deliver one. Oh and the case isnt any great shakes either an occult-themed series of murders linked to the nefarious Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who manages to bedevil London even after we see him hanged. With all that then what does the film have to recommend it? Downey. And Law too. Their banter their wit and their delivery are a delight. Watson is engaged to Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly) who is both jealous of Holmes and rankled by his off-putting manner. He knows everything it seems except the proper time to shut up. Watson is torn. Hes moving out of the flat he shares with Holmes and trying to wean himself off assisting Holmes as he solves cases. But its hard to tear himself away. Meanwhile Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) shows up an old flame of Holmes who needs a favor. Naturally he feels compelled to comply. Gives him something to do after all. Holmes needs that. As we see his mind is never idle even when the rest of him is and he tends to get himself into trouble. But whats a Downey character without trouble? Getting out of jams on the strength of a smirk and a quip are his specialties and if ever there was a place for that its here. Ritchie brings his usual stylized approach to the film. Holmes thinks things through visualizing a clue he picked up here or there or where he will land a punch in a fight. Ritchie in turn visualizes it for us. Its not always successful - at times it drags the story to a halt - but when it works it works well. Strong is always good and thats the case here as he fairly spits his dialogue all black-hooded malevolence. McAdams is OK but her role isnt much. No matter. The fun here is in Downeys performance both solo and in concert with Law (or Strong or Eddie Marsan as the hapless Inspector Lestrade or whomever else Downey happens to be sharing the screen with). And if Ritchie has set up the story for a sequel - and he has - well there could be worst crimes committed against the cinema. It doesnt take a genius of Holmes stature to figure that out.

Pictures Star Tribune Sherlock Holmes Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Sherlock Holmes head-cracking action hero? Guy Ritchies ""Sherlock Holmes"" is an audacious move away from the intricate plots and drawing-room repartee of versions gone by. This is a swashbuckling pratfalling romp designed to make cerebral Holmes purists drop their monocles into their teacups. Its rather overbearing too wild and chaotic to hold together as a mystery. It has scatterbrained shaggy-dog charm though thanks to Robert Downey Jr. at his most mischievous as Holmes. Downeys prankish performance turns the cliche of the asexual dignified sleuth on its head. This Holmes can wear decorum as a disguise but at heart hes a whirligig of flying fists feet and weaponry. Hes a thinker but also an incorrigible prankster and a dabbler in recreational drugs. In one silly scene he teaches a squadron of houseflies to zoom in formation while hes also clearly buzzed. Downeys approach to the role with a funny hat and a leer is a big broad wink to the audience. The film imagines a London of ritual murders secret cults and fiendish criminal masterminds. It opens with a breakneck carriage chase over cobblestone streets to stop a human sacrifice in progress. The slickly hammy Mark Strong gives a sinister gloss to Lord Blackwood the nasty man holding the dagger. He claims to possess mystical powers and has a plan dastardly of course for something approximating world domination. So threatening is his presence that Blackwood continues to bedevil our heroes even after hes executed and pronounced dead by Dr. Watson (Jude Law). Watson is no foil but a full partner soon to be an ex-partner. He and Holmes bicker like an old couple and when Holmes grows too obnoxious Watson has no qualms about slugging him in the snoot. Hes quitting the bro-mantic bachelor digs they shared at 221B Baker Street for marriage. Holmes defiantly self-centered and funny wants to sabotage his plans. Theres nothing like investigating a plot to topple the Crown seize the Empire and take back those upstart American colonies to bring old friends back together. Theres a bit of heterosexual flirting going on too with Rachel McAdams as Holmes seductive nemesis Irene Adler. Theyre made for each other brilliant egocentric devious and undeniably hot. Their dance of distrust is like watching cobras mate. SHERLOCK HOLMES  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for violence and action some startling images and a suggestive scene. Lets skip over the morass of a plot a ""Da Vinci Code"" conspiracy involving a coven of occultist Aleister Crowley types because I didnt understand it. Anyway the chains of mystery clue and solution are irrelevant. ""Sherlock Holmes"" is all about looks and movement. Ritchie (""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"") launched a series of sly cockney crime capers in the 1990s. He likes grime and teeming slums and here he piles it on thick. Philippe Rousselots cinematography and computer images create a dank Sweeney Todd London adjusting to the Industrial Age. Monumental construction projects are halfway built; the city is raw muddy unfinished. Its a messy place handsomely realized. As for movement its Ritchies specialty. He gives Downey several fights with a comically huge thug in which he improvises weapons out of whatevers within reach. As he ducks punches and flings hammers uselessly against the musclemans chest Downey has the plucky frightened body language of a young Charlie Chaplin. The only problem is Ritchies missing sense of proportion. The battles start out at such a frenzy that the only way to achieve a big finish is to sink a ship or blow up a building. An apocalypse every 20 minutes is too much of a good thing. A bit of modesty would have been becoming. Watching this we know that its the opening chapter in an intended series; its got ""franchise"" stamped on every frame. If they refine it going forward Ill gladly hop in the carriage and come along for the ride.

Joe Neumaier Thursday December 24 2009 541 PM Title Sherlock Holmes Theres a moment in ""Sherlock Holmes"" when Robert Downey Jr.s famous detective takes a break from hunting villains bashing doors and fighting bareknuckle brawls to sit in a restaurant and just ... relax. Except Holmes as portrayed by this most kinetic of actors cant relax. For him the world doesnt stop humming with clues even when he wants it to. Holmes hears clinking glasses and sprinklings of conversation notices canes and culinary manners sees who is standing where. He closes his eyes and without doing anything Downey owns the room. Though purists may balk at Arthur Conan Doyles literary world being manhandled into a blockbuster by never-subtle director Guy Ritchie Downey has a winning take on Holmes Hes always on. As he assesses situations we see things happen as he predicted or surmised. And if the villainy in this steampunk-explosive adventure isnt nearly dangerous enough thanks to Downey things are never dull. Its 1890s London and the bloodhound of Baker St. is saved from between-cases lethargy (and suggested drug use) first by his loyal-though-flustered friend Dr. Watson (Jude Law) then by Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) a fiend Holmes caught but whos returned from the grave to take over England via a black-magic scam. While on Blackwoods supernatural trail Holmes reunites with Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams in a study-in-starlet cameo) the only woman the detective has watched with interest. There are breakneck chases graveside visits and a satisfying battle atop an under-construction Tower Bridge. Its a shame Ritchie and the movies cadre of screenwriters went the ""Batman Begins"" route and short-shrifted Holmes adversary. Though not an origin story -- that would be ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" -- this popcorn flick needed to front-load its villainy and break out Prof. Moriarty (Brad Pitts been rumored for the role in possible sequels). But complaints that a character synonymous with braininess has been reduced to just another superhero are overblown; as he did in ""Iron Man"" Downey finds the heart-mind connection and his Holmes is glib and glowering but flirty with Watson (Law wrinkles his moustache in irritation). He doesnt have a deerstalker hat but theres a frequent one-nostril sniff that hints at other things. While Downey and Law dont genuflect before the Holmes name they dont desecrate it either. Downey smartly deduced that an entertaining Holmes movie meant focusing on the right details. He makes a convincing case. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Guy Ritchie does not care about you. This StorySherlock Holmes New sleuth puts brawn over brainWatch the Sherlock Holmes trailerFind Sherlock Holmes showtimes Maybe youve read the Sherlock Holmes canon cover to cover. Twice. Maybe youve seen every episode of the slavishly faithful Jeremy Brett TV series and consider the late actors portrayal of the fictional detective the gold standard of Holmesian acting. Better even than Basil Rathbone. Get over it. Directed by Ritchie (""RocknRolla"") from a script by Michael Robert Johnson Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg and starring Robert Downey Jr. the newest contribution to the world of Arthur Conan Doyle spinoffs is less a product of genuinely Holmesian DNA than say ""Se7en."" (Yes theres a serial killer.) But the movie also looks more than a little bit like the last couple of ""Harry Potter"" films. Theres black magic here too at least ostensibly. And the villainous Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) -- who has been going around London dispensing with people in ritualistic occult executions on his way to world domination -- is a distinctly Voldemort-like figure. Who has I kid you not apparently risen from the dead. What else have we got? Would you believe a dash of James Bond a pinch of Batman (""The Dark Knight"" edition) and a sprinkling of kung fu? For Downeys Holmes is not just a master of disguise deductive reasoning and scientific inquiry. Here hes also a prize-winning pugilist whose brain gets only slightly more of a workout than his fists. True to form Ritchie lavishes his cameras attention on as much loud slo-mo bone-crunching action as he can. And are those nunchucks Holmes is swinging in one scene? The real question is not how much of this is true to the movies literary antecedents. (Not much.) Rather the question is how much of this actually works. In the plus column is Downeys performance. The actor gets one important thing just right. Thats a sense of Holmes as a brilliant misfit a kind of autistic savant who hears sees and remembers everything. One telling scene features Holmes in a noisy crowded restaurant where hes almost overcome by the sounds of clinking silverware and conversation. You can practically feel his senses at work. Ritchies handling of Dr. Watson is another matter. Theres nothing terribly wrong with Jude Laws performance as Holmess right-hand man though hes considerably less stuffy than traditionally portrayed. Many will welcome that as a breath of fresh air along with the increased prominence of Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) a character from a single Conan Doyle story whose expanded role here tones down the films overpowering aroma of testosterone. But the film also presents Watsons relationship with Holmes as vaguely homoerotic. One scene even features them bickering like an old married couple. And there are more than a few not-so-subtle double entendres and sidelong glances suggesting that the two are you know more than friends. This despite the fact that Watson has a fiancee (Kelly Reilly) and that Irene seems to have the hots for Holmes. Not that theres anything wrong with that. The theory has even been advanced that Conan Doyles stories support that interpretation. But it doesnt really serve Ritchies film in the end. All the filmmakers nudge-nudge wink-winking comes across as gratuitous playground teasing. At heart thats the problem with ""Sherlock Holmes."" Not that it isnt as fans of Ritchies earlier rock em-sock em work would probably say awesome. In some ways it is. The film includes a number of genuinely exciting dramatically staged set pieces such as the climactic showdown between Holmes and Blackwood on a half-finished bridge over the River Thames. Rather its that this ""Holmes"" is just about as silly as it awesome. At times Ritchie and company try so hard to make sure this isnt your fathers ""Sherlock Holmes"" that it comes across as well cartoonish. One other influence I forgot to mention? ""Scooby-Doo."" In the films final moments I wouldnt have been at all surprised to hear Lord Blackwood pull off a rubber mask and announce ""And I would have gotten away with it too if werent for you meddling kids""  A1/2 PG-13.

Movie Information Sherlock HolmesRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Guy RitchieActors Robert Downey Jr. Jude Law and Rachel McAdamsRun time 128 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (intense sequences of violence and action some startling images and a scene of suggestive material)Synopsis Robert Downey Jr. plays the titular detective in this Guy Ritchie film. Jude Law is dear Watson.More movies from GuideLive.comDespite the deviations from writer Arthur Conan Doyles version of his hero however I strongly suspect the author would have approved of the scripts originality and excitement. This is rip-roaring action-adventure of high order a sometimes dizzying but ultimately thrilling display of showmanship on the part of the actors director and screenwriters.At times the movie feels like the best of the Harry Potter franchise and at other points it veers into Da Vinci Code territory (in a good way). It also has that gritty unsavory London setting of Sweeney Todd. But although Ritchie clearly borrows from other films it always feels like homage rather than mere copying and it works gloriously.Downeys hygiene-challenged hero wears tatty bathrobes when not working on a case seems barely coherent at times and vents his frustrations through exhibition fighting matches that involve blood and bone-crunching. As Watson Jude Law provides perfect contrast to Holmes general aura of slovenliness. Watson dresses with Victorian-by-way-of- GQ style never shows a whisker out of place and engages in fisticuffs only when all other options have been extinguished.The plot here barely needs discussing; it seems mostly to be leading up to the Act 3 introduction of the name Moriarty (Im hardly divulging a key plot point here; we all expected Prof. M. to show up eventually) and the setup for the inevitable sequel. The villain here a practitioner of dark magic named Lord Blackwood is portrayed with Voldemortian-level creepiness by Mark Strong. One imagines if you could smell his breath itd be laced with sulfur.Blackwood wants to take over the world natch and hes relying on witchcraft human sacrifice and his own resurrection from the dead to achieve that goal. He gets Parliament involved which ticks off Scotland Yard as one might imagine. The coppers call in Holmes and he and Watson aided by Holmes sometimes love interest Irene Adler (a wonderfully devious Rachel McAdams) traverse sewers shipyards and the under-construction Tower Bridge in pursuit.Ritchie uses slow-motion effects and flashbacks to terrific effect in showing how Holmes mind works. In the short story ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" Holmes tells Watson ""You see but you do not observe. The distinction is clear."" Here we see every detail that Holmes observes - and as portrayed by Downey hes utterly incapable of less to the point that it quite nearly drives him insane. As a colleague of mine put it ""Its like if he has one more thing in his mind somethings going to have to leave or its going to explode.""As fabulous as the action scenes and set pieces are the best parts of the movie depict the bantering bromance between Holmes and Watson. Holmes cant stand the thought of Watson marrying and moving out of their shared quarters at 221B Baker St.; he commits an act of nastiness so outrageous against Watsons girlfriend that we should hate him for it. But then Downey blinks those big puppy-dog eyes and neither we nor Watson (nor the girlfriend to her credit) can stay angry for long.One caveat to parents Take that PG-13 rating seriously. There are some extremely disturbing bits here especially a scene that takes place in a slaughterhouse and involves pig butchery that could well turn a good deal of the audience vegetarian. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Sherlock Holmes Action. Starring Robert Downey Jr. Jude Law Rachel McAdams and Mark Strong. Directed by Guy Ritchie. (PG-13. 128 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Guy Ritchie is the worst screenwriter in the world but to be fair he is not the worst director. He is only the worst director of the people who actually get to make movies. As we speak there are human beings walking the Earth - perhaps as many as a half dozen of them - with less directorial talent but theyve been safely diverted into other activities. The good news is that ""Sherlock Holmes"" is the finest movie Ritchie has ever made and thats because he didnt write the script. The bad news is that despite a good script a good story and a great actor - Robert Downey Jr. - not to mention a seriously strong cast including Jude Law and Rachel McAdams - Ritchie still only delivers what is at best a break-even proposition. This is a director who cant get out of his own way. Yet peel away the clutter and the movies reconception of Holmes has merit. In this version he is a sensitive neurotic who completely falls apart between cases. He stays in his room and doesnt wash and his only contact with the world is Watson who is not a bumbler (like Nigel Bruce in the old movies) but a handsome and capable fellow a physician and a war hero. In fact Holmes depends on Watson so much that he is terrified of losing him and does his best to sabotage Watsons relationships with women. Photo Alex Bailey Warner Bros.

Its the one thing Ritchie does well but he only does it once When Holmes steps out into the world he is bombarded by information from every direction. All this probably sounds like the description of a very good movie but its not the one that Ritchie has made. These finer elements are there but theyre buried under long-drawn-out fight scenes in which Holmes and Watson armed with their walking sticks (and Watsons gun) fight it out with ... oh a whole bunch of people. Who can keep track? Theres also the question of tone. As in Ritchies other movies all scenes are played for flippancy and archness that peculiar brand of convoluted breeziness that has become Ritchies signature. Nothing is funny and yet nothing is to be taken seriously. In terms of storytelling everything is a wash. Important information isnt lifted out just tossed off and given equal weight with everything else. So it takes about an hour to lock onto the fact that theres an actual story going on and that guess what its fairly interesting. It concerns a magician (played by Mark Strong a powerful character actor) who is hanged but wont stay dead. This sort of case might not have fazed Basil Rathbone but its especially trying for Downeys Holmes whose hold on sanity is shaky to begin with. He has to lean on Watson (as played by Jude Law Watson is not the funny one but the straight man). Holmes mental state also makes him prey to the seductive charm of career criminal Irene Adler (McAdams). ""Sherlock Holmes"" will probably spark a franchise and its one with genuine potential. But for a franchise to thrive its going to need a reasonably good director. A very good director would be ideal but just a halfway decent one might do the trick. -- Advisory This film contains violence.

Indeed so was Conan Doyle who described his cunning and eccentric sleuth as an ace bare-knuckle fighter who once dispatched his arch nemesis Moriarty in a flurry of martial arts.But Ritchie mega-producer Joel Silver and their (many) writers have left out an essential element soul. Downey who appears to have boned up on his Brit-speak by reviewing the collected works of Jeremy Irons (dry deadpan a little debauched) plays Holmes as a bipolar type (up when hes on a case down when hes not) whose ability to size people up by use of deductive powers is reduced to nothing more than gimmickry.Holmes relationship with Dr. Watson - played with bland alacrity by Jude Law - is akin to watching opponents in a verbal ping-pong match volleys of snappy retorts each man with the requisite glint in his eye but with only glibness in the air.The friction between the duo is due to Watsons impending marriage to the pretty Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly). Holmes is out of sorts that the good doctor is turning his attention elsewhere and moving to the other side of town no less. (Homoerotic subtext? Elementary my dear Watson.) As for Holmes he liaises with Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) whose importance in the Conan Doyle books is huge (shes ""the woman"" in the detectives life) but whose importance in the film is next to nil. Its a thinly written part thinly played.The masterminds behind the heavily CGId Sherlock Holmes had four Conan Doyle novels and 56 short stories to glean from - not to mention dozens of non-canonical Holmes tales some of them quite good (Nicholas Meyers The Seven-Per-Cent Solution is one made into a very nice film too with Nicol Williamson as Holmes).But The Da Vinci Codes Dan Brown seems to be the filmmakers true inspiration the villain here is the priestly Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) a murdering noble and practitioner of the ""dark arts"" who is hanged for his crimes but then eerily returns to life. Blackwood heads a ritualistic cult that trades in signs and symbols - and has designs on reconquering America. Apparently theyre still sore about the Revolution. (Come to think of it the films Masonic huggermugger has much in common with the secret texts of the two National Treasures too.)The London of Sherlock Holmes is dark and squalid - doubly so for Holmes living quarters at 221B Baker Street. Hansom cabs clank and rattle across gas-lit cobblestones the Tower Bridge is under construction (and ready to provide a precipitous backdrop for the movies climax) the new machines of the Industrial Revolution spew oil and smoke.With a clamorous soundtrack and a whirl of elaborate chases and busily choreographed fight scenes this is Sherlock Holmes with Attention Deficit Disorder.Wheres the quiet moment for cool reflection for intense assessment of clues left behind?Or hey even just a sec for this Sherlock dude to catch his breath?Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 24 2009 (out of 4)Starring Robert Downey Jr. Jude Law Rachel McAdams Mark Strong and Eddie Marsan. Directed by Guy Ritchie. 128 minutes. Opens Dec. 25. At major theatres. PG Any critical carping you may hear about how Guy Ritchie has upended Sir Arthur Conan Doyles detective by top-lining Robert Downey Jr. for Sherlock Holmes is complete poppycock. Article Continued BelowWhen you really think about it its elementary that Downey would make a great Holmes.In life and in art hes taken the path of the cerebral risk-taker. Given a chance to sample a new substance or portray an unusual character - hes done everyone from Chaplin to Iron Man - he jumps in with both feet.Those familiar with the Holmes canon know the 19th-century sage was quite a physical man (although maybe not the bare-chested brawler Downey portrays) who also liked to partake of festive pharmaceuticals. And need it be said how quick-witted both Downey and Holmes are? Downey is arguably more true to Doyles vision than Basil Rathbones enduring pipe smoker of earlier films even if Downey eschews the trademark deerstalker cap.Also cheering is the choice of Jude Law as Dr. Watson Holmes sidekick who retains the discipline and the loyalty of his literary counterpart. The homoerotic note that Ritchie adds to the partnership is more his doing than Doyles but its certainly not out of place. Ritchies most successful films have always been raining men. His predilection for frame-by-frame build-up to a punch or punch line also well serves Holmes deductive analysis.So if the main casting is so great and the director is appropriate why the merely ""good"" rating of 2 1/2 stars for Sherlock Holmes?Regrettably its because Ritchie and his screenwriting committee (bad sign that) have completely lost the plot beyond their golden pairing of Downey and Law. Its as if they simply downed tools having satisfied themselves with excellent leads.A great hero needs a great villain and there isnt one to be found in Mark Strongs Lord Blackwood a satanic troublemaker in greasy London town who is more bureaucrat than Beelzebub. Hes among the most tedious and least-threatening baddie to darken a screen in many a moon. (A much better choice would have been beady-eyed Eddie Marsan who gets the lesser role of fumbling and fuming Inspector Lestrade a police official and chief derider of Holmes uncanny deductions.)Also firing on zero cylinders is Canadas own Rachel McAdams as Holmes putative love interest Irene Adler. Its possible that some earlier version of the script actually gave her something to do but little of this made the final cut. She is a definite casualty of Ritchies boyish mindset as is Kelly Reillys Mary Morstan who gets slightly more screen time and attitude as Watsons frustrated fiancee.Then theres the story which is entirely titled towards an intended sequel and extended franchise which under the circumstances seems awfully presumptuous.Sherlock Holmes is meant to be something of a thriller but Holmes careful scrutiny - ""The small details are by far the most interesting"" - doesnt exactly lend itself to the slam-bam mandate of modern action movies. The picture is top-heavy with cheap CGI with things forever vanishing being shot into the air or simply exploding along with Hans Zimmers ponderous score none of it terribly dazzling. Its laughable the way the plot (and even a newspaper headline) keeps referring to how Holmes and Watson must stop the ""panic in the streets"" supposedly caused by Blackwood and his minions when its plainly obvious that the good burghers of London town are happily going about their business.And if the small details are as important as Holmes insists you have to wonder why neither Ritchie nor the continuity person noticed how Downey receives a cut on his lip that magically moves to his cheek and then to his forehead.Still its good enough to just sit back and enjoy Downey and Law plays Holmes and Watson as Victorian versions of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 24 2009 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 07 2014 242PM EST Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Sherlock HolmesDirected by Guy RitchieWritten by Michael Robert Johnson and Andrew PeckhamStarring Robert Downey Jr. Jude Law and Rachel McAdamsClassification PGThe new Sherlock Holmes provides an answer to a question that probably shouldnt have been asked How can Sherlock Holmess character be adapted to an action flick? The idea of getting under Holmess deerstalker cap and rewiring the character seems legitimate and casting idiosyncratic actors like Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is inspired. But Guy Ritchies Holmes reboot feels both too complicated and too elementary dear Watson.Director Ritchies best work has been in his Cockney caper flicks ( Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels  Snatch and RocknRolla ) which feature knotted plots and colourful characters. This time out Ritchie is primarily a director for hire lending his hip spin to establish a new franchise.Directed by Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes stars Robert Downey Jr. Jude Law and Rachel McAdams.How that is intended to shape up is indicated by Sarah Greenwoods goth comic production design - emphasizing computer-generated grey skies huge mechanical contraptions and a half-built Tower Bridge - which has a distinctly Dark Knight vibe. Sherlock Holmes s tone though is much more flippant. The guiding hand you feel is of blockbuster producer Joel Silver. He was the force behind the Lethal Weapon series featuring bantering buddy cops ambitious villains lots of explosions and a thundering score.The few pleasures here come from the performances by Downey and Law. Downeys eccentric Holmes is in many ways truer to author Sir Arthur Conan Doyles stories than the relatively sanitized Basil Rathbone version. Hes portrayed as a dissolute half-shaven bohemian with a poor sense of hygiene and manic-depressive swings. Pushing the macho Holmes idea a bit too far though the script sees him as a participant in bare-knuckle bouts in filthy pubs.Laws Watson is not really a sidekick but a partner. They engage in a half-hostile half-flirtatious affectionate banter which unfortunately never feels as twinkling as the scriptwriters seem to think it is. The possessive Holmes is distressed that Watson wants to move out of their Baker Street pigsty to marry of all things a woman (Kelly Reilly). When he finally meets her Holmes is so offensive that she pours a drink over his head.Holmes gets a woman in his own life when Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) lets herself into his Baker Street digs. Shes a con-artist who has some history with Holmes but now she has a job for him she says. Theres a dwarf who needs to be found (isnt there always?).Soon Holmes finds himself caught up in a plot of stupor-inducing complexity. It involves ritual murders a secret order and an aristocratic sorcerer (Mark Strong) who is hanged and then stages his own resurrection. Though he possesses some of the worst inclinations of Dracula and Hitler he comes across as a lesser Harry Potter villain with a penchant for needlessly elaborate methods of dispatching people.Among the supporting cast Eddie Marsans truculent Inspector Lestrade is amusing but most characters exist only in snippets between the action sequences. McAdams in particular has little time to establish why her character is supposed to be so fascinating.The movie concludes by setting up an inevitable sequel in which Holmes and Watson are pitted against the diabolical Professor Moriarty. And none too soon The franchise is definitely in need of a mastermind criminal or otherwise.

Photo ALEX BAILEY Who the deuce decided to filter Sherlock Holmes through ""Batman amp; Robin""? ""Sherlock Holmes"" dumbs down a century-old synonym for intelligence with Samp;M gags witless sarcasm murky bombast and twirling action-hero moves that belong in a ninja flick. Directed to do frantic American-buddy-movie shtick by Guy Ritchie who has never before ruled a big-budget production the normally brainy Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law compete rather than complement each spewing his deductions like ""Rain Man"" meets ""Good Will Hunting"" instead of leading the audience through the elegant process of solving a mystery. Somebodytellthesedirectorsthattalkingfastdoesnotmakeyousoundsmart. Holmes (Downey) and Watson (Law) are on the trail of Lord Blackwood (an unremarkable Mark Strong) a satanic serial killer who just before getting his neck stretched on the gallows warns Sherlock that from beyond the grave the mayhem will continue with three further deaths to be laid at the door of 221b Baker St. Holmes -- a slovenly fly-catching weirdo instead of a detached don -- charges through several fight scenes that are more Stallone than Sherlock and the frenzied chop of the editing blurs the brawls. A megabudget franchise movie has to have more action than a public-TV mystery but in seeking a big American audience Ritchie is like one of those Londoners who when imitating a Yank affects an exaggerated drawl supposed to connote ""Texan"" that lands closer to ""lobotomy ward."" And whats with his never-been-to-London staging? One minute the characters are tumbling out of the Houses of Parliament the next theyre miles away at the under-construction Tower Bridge. For Holmes to be Holmes he has to figure out solutions not kick them in the teeth. Assuming Edwardian London was crawling with personal trainers and fully equipped with Nautilus machines how would the worlds most devoted bookworm acquire stone-slab abs? Are there steroids in his Darjeeling? Watson a problem character -- a straight man a whiteboard for the answer to be sketched upon -- here loses his (limited) everyman appeal and becomes a sort of knockoff Holmes occasionally beating the master to the answer while equaling him in fisticuffery and woefulness of badinage ""Relax Im a doctor."" They argue about whether a little fellow is a dwarf or a midget swap hoary one-liners (""they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity"") and discuss whether Sherlocks ""depravity know[s] no bounds."" They agree that it does and are proved correct when Sherlock finds himself lashed naked and contented to a bed. Rachel McAdams as Sherlocks canny but devious ex adds no spark as she asks for help with a case that involves a shadowy professor who is trying to trap Holmes. If youre going to cast waify little sparrows like McAdams dont expect us to buy it when she clocks a trained assassin and he collapses as if hes been Michael Strahand. (If Kathy Bates turned up though the average hired killer would put in for a hardship bonus or maybe just call in sick.) The best parts are in the third act during a semi-satisfying decoding of Lord Blackwoods nefarious schemes but the rush to disentangle everything (together with an equally crazed bit of place-setting for the sequel -- invariably a sign that even the filmmakers know they didnt get it right this time) arrived after Id lost interest. Anyway the payoff is the one section of the script that is too Victorian -- reeking of far-fetched potions and antidotes. The rest of the movie could scarcely have been more off-base if Sherlock had worn a backwards Yankee cap instead of a deerstalker and Watson had inquired of him ""What up Holmes?"" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next TVs Top 10 moments of the decade Read Next TVs Top 10 moments of the decade Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46195 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20783 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17005 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

ABOUT THE MOVIESherlock Holmes  1/2 (out of four)Stars Robert Downey Jr. Jude Law Rachel McAdams Mark Strong Eddie MarsanDirector Guy RitchieDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13Running time 2 hours 8 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Sherlock Holmes has been reimagined with fighting skills as potent as his intellectual acumen. The iconic British detective has undergone a makeover in the latest Sherlock Holmes with little resemblance to Sir Arthur Conan Doyles literary character. Only his pipe-smoking remains intact. MORE Sit-down with Ritchie Downey and Law Holmes as a lethal action hero would seem a natural assignment for a director such as Guy Ritchie (Snatch). And having proven himself a savvy superhero in Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. would seem a wise choice for a character boasting equal parts brawn and brains. Holmes is an even more slovenly shut-in than he was on the page. His grooming doesnt involve plaid coats or rakish caps. It also doesnt seem to include a razor. But hes an inventor and a guy who definitely pumps iron in the dark confines of his rented rooms on Baker Street. As for Dr. Watson (Jude Law) hes no longer a bumbler. Hes a marksman a risk-taker and a romantic gent with a fiancee (Kelly Reilly). But Watsons more substantive relationship is with Holmes. Though the production design looks entrancingly authentic neither Holmes Watson nor others sound like they live in the 1890s. Worse the plot is convoluted. Holmes is on the trail of the lofty Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) whose dastardly deeds involve occult crimes and threaten the future of London. The detective is both hampered and assisted by Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams). There is more chemistry between Downey and Law than between Downey and McAdams. But there is not much point to her role except to show that woman can be action heroes even in corsets and skirts. Old London achieved via superb visual effects is breathtaking in its grimy verisimilitude. And Downey is charming. But his world is jarringly frenetic in the manner of most Ritchie films. Ritchies device of playing back the process of Holmes deductive reasoning is at first intriguing then becomes intrusive. While this incarnation has visual flair and attitude it is too modern and it blithely jettisons Holmes wit and wisdom.

His understatement is of a piece with the rest of Guy Ritchies film which twists stretches knots tangles distorts bleaches smudges and sometimes tears the very fabric of Arthur Conan Doyles Victorian canvas. The Holmes of this action adventure played by Robert Downey Jr. is a master of the martial arts and perfectly capable of brutal behavior when its required of him by the brutishness of a black-and-brown London that recalls ""The Elephant Man."" The movie as a whole is clever and conspicuously overwrought. But Mr. Downeys performance is elegantly wrought; hes as quick-witted as his legendary character and blithely funny in the lovers spats--all right the mystery-lovers spats--that Holmes keeps having with Jude Laws witty Dr. Watson. ENLARGE Jude Law as Dr. John Watson and Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes Warner Bros. The director made his name with contemporary comedies about whimsical casually violent thugs so its no surprise that he pays more attention to the underworld of Holmess time than to the milieu of the haughty hero. He and his writers--four of them get credit for the script--have closed the gap between hunter and prey. This Holmes has been dehaughtified to say the least. Hes unkempt even scruffy and a pack rat who looks a little cracked. Still his intelligence is intact. Its on display most vividly in a restaurant scene when Holmes makes a series of ruthlessly accurate deductions about Watsons lovely fiancee--shes played by Kelly Reilly--and in several quick-cut sequences that deconstruct the detectives mental processes. The villain Blackwood is played by Mark Strong the excellent actor who played a Jordanian security chief in ""Body of Lies."" While hes impressive here the fruits of his evil genius are less so. The four writers in question have concocted a plot that promises to be diabolical (a satanic rite for openers with a begowned beauty about to be tortured) but grows silly in inverse proportion to its grandiosity (a doomsday machine designed to do in the House of Lords) then finally performs a peculiar act of self-deflation by revealing that Blackwoods seeming magic was only a succession of conjuring tricks. And its hard to follow let alone care about the comings of goings of Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) a criminal who has bested Sherlock Holmes in the past but is worsted by the scripts convolutions. Doyle had ambivalent feelings about his Sherlock Holmes stories and books; they were spectacularly successful but not the kind of art he aspired to. Ambivalence is appropriate here too not because Mr. Ritchie has violated a venerable literary icon by turning him into an action hero--kids will probably buy into the notion and whats the harm?--but because the movies kung fu conniptions are far more mundane than the settings in which they play out. The truly distinctive physicality comes less from the familiar fight sequences than from Sarah Greenwoods set design and Philippe Rousselots cinematography complemented by computer-generated visions of a Victorian London simultaneously moldering and exploding with new construction. And even though Mr. Downey has emerged from ""Iron Man"" as a full-fledged action hero its great fun to watch him do the detective work he always does finding laughs and bright surprises in every scene.  It isnt hard to imagine a Gallic knock-off of ""Its Complicated"" played as shallow stylish farce. Ten years after her divorce Jane a middle-age mother of three crosses paths with Jake her ex-husband and his young sexy wife. Unexpectedly Jakes love for Jane rekindles and they have a passionate affair forcing Jane to choose between being her exs mistress or her own woman which she thought she had been all along. In this original American version the filmmaker Nancy Meyers plays it as a comedy with lavish trappings--the setting is mostly upscale Santa Barbara--but a comedy about real feelings deep confusions old regrets and the yearning of those no longer young for a new lease on life. After listening to Jane and Jake talk it out in the interminable process of working it out--they explore their relationship as exhaustively and exhaustingly as any kids on Facebook--I found myself wishing for more shallows and fewer depths. ENLARGE Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin in Its Complicated. Melinda Sue Gordon Thats unfair to Meryl Streep who portrays Jane with infectious humor. Shes endearing when she announces cheerfully ""Im a bit of a slut""; when she says to Alec Baldwins Jake ""Youre an adulterer and I am . . . an awful person basically"" (we know shes not) or when she begs her shrink for permission to pursue the affair and thanks him with a youve-given-me-such-a-gift gesture when he simply allows that it cant hurt. And even though Ms. Streep looks radiantly lovely at the age she is she makes her characters vulnerability both funny and touching in a bedroom encounter during which Jake will see Jane standing naked for the first time in a decade. But its also unfair to ask Ms. Streep as the movie does to sustain vitality and spontaneity in the midst of serial contrivances--smoking a joint using a Web cam to disastrous effect talking ritual talk about food and home improvement. (Jake himself is a contrivance though Mr. Baldwin mostly manages to make him a likable one.) Steve Martin plays an architect who wants to bring true love into Janes life. Zoe Kazan is sweetly quirky as the divorced couples younger daughter. Lake Bell fails to find a scintilla of humanity in Agness Jakes icy young wife but John Tolls cinematography compensates for that and a lot more by bathing the production in a soft and welcome warmth.

"Sherlock Holmes review Nothing to write Holmes about |       NJ.com comments Sherlock Holmes review Nothing to write Holmes about Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 23 2009 at 439 PM updated December 23 2009 at 500 PM View/Post Comments AP/WARNER BROS.Robert Downey Jr. left and Jude Law in a scene from ""Sherlock Holmes."" Making a great Sherlock Holmes film should be elementary. You get an acerbic and commanding character to play the deductive genius and a faithful and avuncular type to be his Dr. Watson. You bring in a dastardly villain set a devilishly clever plot in motion turn Holmes logic loose and well -- the games afoot. Sherlock Holmes (PG-13) Warner Bros. (125 min.) Directed by Guy Ritchie. With Robert Downey Jr. Jude Law Rachel McAdams. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys RatingTWO STARS Ratings note The film contains violence and sensuality But the beautifully produced yet unsatisfying ""Sherlock Holmes"" shows its harder than that. The film stars Robert Downey Jr. -- yes a Yank -- as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson. There is it seems a devilish nobleman running about London half Aleister Crowley half Jack the Ripper whom our heroes have to bring to justice -- which they do with stiff-upper-lipped courage. Except that a few days after his hanging the dark lord is up and running around again. This feels at first a little more Hammer horror than Holmes but be patient with the heebie-jeebie monster stuff all the black masses and men in cowled robes. All will be explained at the end -- and in this case at length and rather dully. But there are other problems. They dont include surprisingly the idea of Holmes as action hero. That change caused the biggest stir when early photos showed Downey brawling and stripped to the waist like the hunk of the Baskervilles. But it was the movies that made Holmes into an aesthete in the first place. Go back to the canon and youll find a good shot excellent boxer and student of judo. (You dont think Moriarity threw himself over that cliff?) Yet even as this film restores Holmes athleticism it removes some of his charm and singular physicality. Downey is a fine actor admitted but hes a modestly-sized man with soft features and a quiet delivery; I miss the assertive hawk-like presence of Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett. (Daniel Day-Lewis could have done it but then Daniel Day-Lewis can do anything.) And Jude Law quite rightly rescues Watson from the Nigel Bruce cliche of harmless old duffer; after all the good doctor is brave enough to have seen service in Afghanistan and smart enough to be Holmes friend. But Law still seems a little too common a shade too ordinary. The two actors work well together and gamely do a variety of fight scenes. Yet when they appear never do you think yes perfect. And both unfortunately are trapped in a Guy Ritchie film. Ritchie began his career in the 90s as a sort of Anglo answer to Quentin Tarantino. His films featured frantic camera movements lots of talk and an immersion in lower-class crime. Full of cheap attitude and lager-lout manners they were like moving Maxim magazines leering and jeering and strictly for adolescent boys. And for all its lush production values ""Sherlock Holmes"" is not much more sophisticated. Although the script brings in Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler a Jersey girl and an adversary whom Holmes respectfully referred to as ""the"" woman but it has no idea of what to do with her. Her motivations are obscure even when theyre explained and her relationship with Holmes has no humor or life. And the movie itself is overdone full of ridiculously delayed slow-motion action scenes (or even more boring action sequences shot twice -- first with Holmes predictions of what hes going to do and then again with him doing it). The whole film doesnt feel so much like Holmes as a strange and unwanted sequel to Will Smiths ""Wild Wild West."" The film seems already prepared for its own sequels; not every villain is brought to final justice and yes that is Moriarity himself occasionally lurking in the shadows. (Very deep shadows; apparently theyre waiting to see how this film does before casting the Napoleon of crime.) But everything here is more frantic than fun. What went wrong first and how could it have been fixed? Its a mystery fit for the great detective himself.

But a week and a half after I saw Sherlock Holmes I found that the film had all but disappeared from my mind and so I went back to see it a second time. I dont think it was just the usual clutter of holiday releases that caused the memory of this one to vanish like a mirage. Directed by the compulsively in-your-face Guy Ritchie (RocknRolla) Sherlock Holmes is an odd amalgam a top-heavy light entertainment that keeps throwing things at you and doesnt seem too concerned with whether they stick. Sherlock (Robert Downey Jr.) the venerable sleuth of 1880s London is still a master of deduction sniffing out clues that are invisible to everyone else. But he is now in addition a crowd-pleasing man of action who leaps out of buildings dodges explosions and engages in the occasional ultraviolent bare-knuckle brawl. He and his comrade the genial Dr. Watson (Jude Law) are still partners in crime-fighting but theyre also whimsical nattering fops who carry on like old college roommates sharing private jokes for which you really had to be there. The film brims with ""colorful"" London-cobblestone backlot atmosphere -- which sounds like a good thing except that Sherlock Holmes is often as busy and crowded as a musical so that the background frequently threatens to engulf the foreground. Oh yes I forgot There is also?a detective plot. It rests on some shady business about a slime named Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is tried and hanged for murder -- Dr. Watson is on hand to ensure that hes dead -- but who then mysteriously rises from the grave so that he can launch a plan for world domination. If that sounds like an extravagant ambition for a Sherlock Holmes villain the whole movie in its popcorn way is bumptiously extravagant; its like a 19th-century National Treasure sequel crossed with an episode of the old Batman TV series. All of which would be fine if it added up to a crackerjack entertainment but Sherlock Holmes while a diverting enough night out is both fun and numb enjoyable and exhausting. Its a case of more adding up to less. The best thing in the movie is Downey. As Holmes hes rumpled and amusingly jittery an investigator who lives on his own plane of perception and can scarcely be bothered with anyone elses. Theres an authentic Sherlockian intensity about him. Early on the film shows us that Holmes is a creature of deduction even in the middle of a fistfight In the space of a few super-slo-mo seconds he literally thinks out the half-dozen punches hes about to throw. Downey analyzing each blow (and the damage it will cause) with his puckish British inflections transfixes us with his casual command. Each time that Holmes actually has to figure something out Downey widens those dark saucer eyes which are shot so theyre pools of black; hes hypnotic. The movie unfortunately isnt really built around Holmes deductions. Theyre more like brainy little hermetic games sprinkled along the way. Even his ability to deconstruct a fight is introduced only to be forgotten. Since Sherlock Holmes is the kickoff to a franchise it might for once have been terrific if the movie had been an origin story with Holmes discovering his lightning powers of intuition. But Sherlock Holmes with its jaded hero jumbly overkill and skittery mystery plot is more like a part-five sequel made by people who were forced to put on a big show of conviction. The whole movie is a put-on -- its a smoke-and-mirrors blockbuster. Mark Strong as the villain looks like Andy Garcia as a hulking Dracula but apart from that theres not much to him and Rachel McAdams as a former lover of Holmes now with murkier loyalties is enticing in such a sweet Victorian way that it seems perverse for the movie to muffle the romantic spark between her and our hero. The real ""love story"" of course is the jokey stiff-upper-lip entirely fraternal bromance between Holmes and Watson. Their muttery ironic joshing has a certain out-of-time talk-show cleverness but like the movie itself it holds your attention even though theres never really anything at stake.

These little problems help me to do so"" Sherlock Holmes tells his sidekick Dr. Watson at the conclusion of Arthur Conan Doyles ""The Red-Headed League."" Its one of Doyles periodic hints that his hero uses his brilliance to placate a tortured psyche. Doyles most famous character has an unparalleled genius for detection but hes also kind of a mess a drug-abusing weirdo kept from turning into a total recluse only by Watsons friendship and a steady parade of mysteries making their way up the steps of 221B Baker Street. Robert Downey Jr. sounds that self-destructive eccentricity as a keynote from his first appearance in Sherlock Holmes and his twitchy winning performance returns to it throughout the film. The interpretation veers sharply away from the tweedy expectations set by Basil Rathbone and others but its as true in its own way to the source. Holmes is a man only fully engaged by life when it offers a direct challenge. In all other respects however this is very much a Sherlock Holmes movie for the blockbuster era a propulsive noisy visually immersive plot machine that pits Downeys Holmes against a secret society and breaks up the investigation with a series of action setpieces. Fortunately its a highly entertaining example of the form directed with just the right amount of panache by Guy Ritchie (Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels) whose showmanship finally finds the right side of self-indulgence. (Well mostly. He does use a flatulent bulldog as a punchline.) Jude Law co-stars as a wry Dr. Watson whose impending marriage distresses Holmes in the moments when they arent investigating the apparent resurrection of a criminal mastermind (Mark Strong). Rachel McAdams plays Irene Adler Holmes flirtatious bete noir and sometime ally and to Ritchies credit he gives the trio a fair amount of witty banter between the mad chases and fisticuffs. But Ritchies cleverest flourish--slowing the film down and focusing on Downeys face as he plots out a plan seconds before putting it into action--wisely relies on the strengths of both the hero and the man playing him. Called up in moments of need from the exile of his own thoughts hes able to see the world as it really is and bend it to his will.

Hoberman Robert Downey Jr.s Wry Sherlock Holmes Tuesday December 22 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Sherlock Holmes is another critique of filmmaking--if only by example. As over-emphatic as one might expect from the ham-fisted Guy Ritchie this resurrection of the worlds most famous detective is a dank noisy affair--punctuated by occasional pratfalls and soigne bits of British understatement--unfolding in a gloomy London that seems a bootleg copy of A Christmas Carols CGI set.Arthur Conan Doyles detective was in essence a master of the 19th-century scientific method who used empirical observation and logical deduction to make sense of a chaotic universe; its inevitable that his 21st-century avatar would be a buff superhero. In addition to being the smartest man on earth the new Holmes is a master of barehanded fisticuffs--using strategies derived from lightning physical calculations. As played by Robert Downey Jr. with gloomy insouciance Holmes is also something of a Bushwick boho. He wears shades and rather than the traditional deerstalker hat favors a porkpie job with the brim turned up.Hollywood logic has further dictated that the movie be a bit of a buddy film even a love story. Dr. Watson (Jude Law batting his eyes a bit less than usual) is a good-looking bloke whose impending marriage drives Sherlock half-mad with jealousy. To complete the triangle the unscrupulous queen of crime Irene Adler (played with game enthusiasm by Rachel McAdams) is hopelessly gone on the detective. ""What if we trusted each other?"" she plaintively suggests.The wartime Holmes and Watson (Basil Rathbone and fumfering Nigel Bruce) battled the Axis as well as the Spider Woman. A few near-subliminal references to terrorism notwithstanding theres little attempt to make super Holmes topical. On the other hand theres at least a residual trace of the detective as master of deductive logic. The movie opens with a raid on a Satanic ritual and although it appears to go totally supernatural is actually (and nonsensically) revealed as . . . something even less credible. The real mystery however is Downey. Whatever his personal demons this actor seems immune from self-contempt; at least on the screen he brings a wry conviction to even the most hackneyed part or ridiculously written role.jhobermanvillagevoice.com Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

"Sherlock Holmes | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sherlock-holmes ) Sherlock Holmes (United States/United Kingdom/Australia 2009) December 22 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Schlock Holmes is too brutal. Call it instead The Adventure of the Da Vinci Code Knock-off or The Adventure of the Missing Ending. Either would be equally appropriate. This original story which borrows heavily from Sir Arthur Conan Doyles ""canonical"" tales contains multiple Easter Eggs for Holmes fans but fails in the bigger picture developing a credible narrative. Unduly influenced by both comic books and The Da Vinci Code Guy Ritchies ""re-interpretation"" of Holmes feels more spastic than kinetic. The camera rarely stops moving and when it does the weaknesses of the script become apparent. Conan Doyle wrote 60 adventures starring his famous detective (56 short stories four novels). Some were preposterous but none were quite as silly as this one which at times feels more like overwrought fan fiction than a fully developed Sherlock Holmes tale. The trailers and commercials misrepresent Guy Ritchies vision of Holmes which is actually more faithful to the Conan Doyle version than the ""action hero"" he is made out to be in Sherlock Holmes promotional material. Admittedly this interpretation of Holmes is more action-oriented than that of either Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett but none of the physicality (bare-knuckle boxing fencing) is out-of-character with Conan Doyles Holmes. Ritchie plays up the action in order to satisfy modern audiences who might find a more subdued portrayal to be too dull but he doesnt perform character assassination. In fact the area in which this Holmes diverges most obviously from the literary source is in the overtly romantic relationship with Irene Adler. Sherlock Holmes opens with Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his faithful sidekick Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) apprehending serial killer Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) before he can claim his sixth victim. By the time the police arrive led by Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan) Holmes and Watson have the situation under control. Before Blackwood is hanged for his crimes he predicts to Holmes that the mayhem and murder will not stop with his execution and this statement is prophetic. When Blackwood appears to have risen from the grave the case takes a macabre turn. It gets stranger when its revealed that Blackwood was dabbling in the occult and was a member of a secret magical society. His goal to destroy Parliament take over England and move on to world domination. Typical Blofeld stuff... Meanwhile Holmes is dealing with some personal issues. Watson is moving out so he can marry his beloved Mary (Kelly Reilly) - an act that leaves Holmes feeling lonely at 221B Baker Street. He is visited by old flame Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) who comes to him with a seemingly simple case - one so straightforward that Holmes immediately senses something sinister. His suspicions are well-founded since Irenes re-appearance in Holmes life is being orchestrated by an individual whose identity will surprise no Holmes fan. Sherlock Holmes concludes without a satisfying ending. Despite an overly generous running time of 130 minutes the movie fails to wrap up a significant secondary plot thread. Although its sensible for a production like this which has a goal of launching a franchise to include some ""hooks"" that could be used for a sequel being this blatant may result in viewers feeling cheated. Since theres no guarantee there will be a Sherlock Holmes 2 its a poor storytelling approach to leave major subplots unresolved. The Golden Compass is a case study of how this sort of ill-considered approach can leave audiences unfulfilled. Although Downeys Holmes wont make anyone forget Jeremy Brett any time soon this represents another intriguing performance by one of his generations best actors. Downey isnt the perfect embodiment of Conan Doyles coldly logical protagonist but most of the traits are in evidence albeit filtered through the films hyperactive style. Downeys Holmes is impulsive intelligent arrogant occasionally petty and almost always amazing with his deductive reasoning. He never once says the word ""elementary"" or wears a deerstalker hat but he does mention once or twice that ""the games afoot."" Curiously his interaction with Jude Laws Watson seems to owe more to the House/Wilson banter from the T.V. series House (the character of House is based on Holmes and Wilson is Houses Watson) that it does to the relationship in the Conan Doyle stories. Law is fine as Watson but he frequently ends up in Downeys shadow (a not altogether unexpected development). Early in the proceedings Ritchie does something interesting in an attempt to fuse Holmes physical and intellectual prowess. On two occasions he provides access to internal monologues in which the detective plans the sequence of blows he will deliver to disable an opponent. Unfortunately after the boxing scene in which Holmes dispatches McMurdo (an event alluded to in ""The Sign of Four"") Ritchie abandons this approach even though it would have added a little variety to some of the generic fight scenes to come. Much as the 2009 Star Trek paid homage to the series past Sherlock Holmes incorporates many elements of Holmesian lore; in the process it comes dangerously close to seeming like overzealous fanfic. Although Irene Adler appeared in only one of Conan Doyles 60 adventures she remains a popular source of speculation and interest in fan circles. Here shes more of a traditional love interest than The Ideal Unattainable Woman she was in ""A Scandal in Bohemia."" In addition to Irene Sherlock Holmes features appearances by and/or references to other well-known Conan Doyle creations Mycroft Holmes Mrs. Hudson Mary Morstan Inspector Lestrade and Professor Moriarty. Clearly a great deal of effort went into jettisoning Sherlock Holmes reputation as a stodgy intellectual and transforming him into a swashbuckling hero who would feel perfectly at home in his own comic book. Downeys take on the character while considerably different from that of any of his illustrious predecessors remains within Conan Doyles parameters. The reason Sherlock Holmes fails at least as often as it succeeds is because more effort and attention was lavished upon the concept than upon the script. Given a worthy story Downeys Holmes might have been memorable. Here hes an interesting character in search of a worthwhile story. Perhaps the seemingly unavoidable sequel (at least in the filmmakers eyes) will deliver what this one does not.

If you can get over the idea of Sherlock Holmes as an action hero -- and if indeed you want to -- then there is something to enjoy about this flagrant makeover of fictions first modern detective into a man of brawn as much as brain. To say that this is not grandpapas Sherlock Holmes will be either irrelevant or a plus for most of the intended audience who know the iconic Victorian/Edwardian-era sleuth by reputation if at all. A good number of Robert Downey Jr.s ""Iron Man"" fans will likely follow him here as he turns the venerable deerstalker-capped and becaped figure into a gym-toned half-deranged Holmes unlike any seen before. Worldwide prospects look potent. Memorably played 14 times by Basil Rathbone through the 40s Holmes has been seen only intermittently onscreen since then notably in Billy Wilders inspired but tragically truncated 1970 ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" as well as in ""The Seven-Per-Cent Solution"" in 1976 and ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" in 1985; on British television played by Jeremy Brett; and in an animated series voiced by Peter OToole. Theoretically Arthur Conan Doyles genius of Baker Street is as open to reinvention and reinterpretation as any character so there is a measure of amusement to be had in observing the contortions producer Joel Silver director Guy Ritchie and screenwriters Michael Robert Johnson Anthony Peckham (""Invictus"") and Simon Kinberg (""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") have gone through to refit the character to the presumed requirements of the mass international audience. Their choice was to transform the historically slim reclusive intellectual eccentric into an evident manic depressive whose idea of recreation is to slum in what looks like an East End precursor of the fight club. Such Holmes purists as may remain will blanch but young audiences particularly males will likely swill the topped-out serving of sweaty masculinity flexing muscle imaginative violence unusual weaponry impudent banter and ballsy effrontery. Although Downeys recent ascent to action-blockbuster topliner defines the nature of this new Holmes the thesps essential identity as a resourceful and vigorous character actor asserts itself up to a point. Distractingly for the time period he sports a wild-haired stubbled look that makes him resemble Al Pacinos kid brother and there are times when his well-accented Britspeak reaches such basso depths that his dialogue cant be fully understood. But his keen eyes quick tongue and edgy combustibility do lend credence to a man whos able to see anticipate and comprehend things others cant -- which in this case includes a slow-motion compendium of the bodily harm that awaits his opponent at fisticuffs. Once past the nonsensically overloaded martial-artsy opening stretch a worthy opponent to Holmes announces himself in the person of Lord Blackwood (the ever-impressive Mark Strong). Condemned to die for the murder of several women this self-possessed practitioner of black magic ominously warns that ""Death is only the beginning"" as he is led to the hangmans noose after which he is duly pronounced dead by none other than Holmes sometimes partner and chronicler Dr. Watson now transformed into a dashing pretty boy by Jude Law. Unfortunately for Holmes Watson and the other citizens of London Blackwood shortly resurrects himself and undertakes to establish his New Order with part of the plan being Britains reconquest of that former colony across the Atlantic. Blackwoods organization a Masonic-like cult with members in high places also prefigures fascist iconography in terms of greatcoat design hair stylings and expressive scowling so at least sartorially its members have a distinct edge on the disheveled Holmes. In addition to taking on men twice his weight in hand-to-hand combat Holmes diverts himself by undermining Watsons relationship with his fiancee (Kelly Reilly) and coping with the return of Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) a master criminal who has twice bested Holmes in the past and whose personal intentions with him are far from honorable. Curiously the one area of traditional Holmesiana the script doesnt really transgress is his lack of romantic attachment. Some backstory and offscreen shenanigans with Irene are suggested but there remains a reticence to doing anything dramatically interesting with this woman who is not very well integrated into the rest of the story a shortcoming the normally resourceful McAdams is unable to do much about. Action scenes are devised to accentuate aspects of turn-of-the-century industrial London ruffians of notably indestructible stature (particularly a scar-faced giant who just keeps on coming) and deaths of a diabolically creative nature that only the scientifically adept Blackwood could concoct and the encyclopedically knowledgeable Holmes could analyze. After a well-prepared dramatic climax in Parliament a putative action exclamation point feels hokey and too CGI-dominated. Olde London town probably hasnt looked this filthy onscreen since David Lynchs ""The Elephant Man"" and every frame has been crammed with visual stimulation thanks to Sarah Greenwoods detailed production design Philippe Rousselots gritty lensing and Jenny Beavans determinedly creative costume design. Ritchie has never worked on a scale anything approaching this before and while some of the directorial affectations are distracting he keeps the action humming. Still the single most important craft contribution is Hans Zimmers score. Overbearing in the opening scene and opportunistic in its lift of a key melodic phrase from Ennio Morricones ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" soundtrack it soon settles in to provide not only narrative propulsion but enormously helpful mood colorings. The orchestrations are particularly fresh with bracing use of the zither and other unusual instruments introducing surprising textures throughout.

By David Denby Corporate interests come under fire in James Camerons movie.   Credit Illustration by Frank Stockton James Camerons ""Avatar"" is the most beautiful film Ive seen in years. Amid the hoopla over the new power of 3-D as a narrative form and the excitement about the complicated mix of digital animation and live action that made the movie possible no one should ignore how lovely ""Avatar"" looks how luscious yet freewheeling bounteous yet strange. As Cameron surges through the picture plane brushing past tree branches coursing alongside foaming-mouthed creatures we may be overcome by an uncanny sense of emerging becoming transcending--a sustained mood of elation produced by vaulting into space. Working with a crew of thousands Cameron has reimagined nature the movie is set on Pandora a distant moon with thick forests alpine chasms and such fantastic oddities as wooded mountains hanging in the sky. The geographical center of the movie is a giant willow tree where a tribal clan the Navi worships the connections among all living things--a dubious-sounding mystical concept that the movie manages to make exciting. In ""Titanic"" Cameron turned people blue as they died in icy waters but this time blue is the color of vibrant health the Navi are a translucent pale blue with powerful long-waisted bodies flat noses and wide-set eyes. In their easy command of nature they are meant to evoke aboriginal people everywhere. They have spiritual powers and despite their elementary weapons--bows and arrows--real powers too. From each ones head emerges a long braid ending in tendrils that are alive with nerves. When the Navi plug their braids into similar neural cords that hang from the heads of crested horselike animals and giant birds they achieve zahelu which is not apparently as pleasurable as sex but somewhat more useful--the Navis thoughts govern the animals behavior. Cameron believes in hooking up this world is as much a vertical experience as a horizontal one and the many parts of it cohere and flow together. The movie is a blissful fantasy of a completely organic life. The Navis turf is also rich with an energy-yielding mineral called Unobtainium (which is as close as Cameron comes to a joke in this movie). Eager to harvest the mineral corporate predators joined by heavily armed military contractors have established a base on Pandora. Theyve been feeding peoples DNA into long pale-blue versions of their bodies--avatars--and setting them loose among the Navi where they learn their lingo and try to argue them off the land. A high-powered biologist (Sigourney Weaver) who loves the Navi has been to the woods and back many times. She is followed by Jake (Sam Worthington) an ex-marine. He has withered legs but reconditioned as an avatar he can spring and jump anywhere; hes fearless and as wild as a monkey. His job if he cant persuade the Navi to leave is to find out enough about them so that contractors can come in and kill them. The next stage of the fable isnt exactly a surprise living among the Navi Jake falls in love with a warrior princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who looks like a painted amazon on a Milan runway. She teaches him the native ways and protects him from the other Navi who discover that hes a spy. Its the old story of Pocahontas and John Smith mixed perhaps with the remnants of Westerns (like ""Dances with Wolves"") in which a white man spends some time with the Comanche or the Sioux and then won over tries to defend the tribe against the advancing civilization that will annihilate it. Science is good but technology is bad. Community is great but corporations are evil. ""Avatar"" gives off more than a whiff of nineteen-sixties counterculture by way of environmentalism and current antiwar sentiment. ""What have we got to offer them--lite beer and bluejeans?"" Jake asks. Well actually life among the Navi for all its physical glories looks a little dull. True theres no reality TV or fast food but theres no tennis or Raymond Chandler or Ella Fitzgerald either. But lets not dwell on the sentimentality of Camerons notion of aboriginal life--the movie is striking enough to make it irrelevant. Nor is there much point in lingering over the irony that this anti-technology message is delivered by an example of advanced technology that cost nearly two hundred and fifty million dollars to produce; or that this anti-imperialist spectacle will invade every available theatre in the world. Relish instead the pterodactyls or the flying velociraptors or whatever they are--large beaky beasts green with yellow reptile patches--and the bright-red flying monster with jaws that could snap an oak. Jake like a Western hero breaking a wild horse has to tame one of these creatures in order to prove his manhood and the scene has a barbaric splendor. The movies story may be a little trite and the big battle at the end between ugly mechanical force and the gorgeous natural world goes on forever but what a show Cameron puts on The continuity of dynamized space that he has achieved with 3-D gloriously supports his trippy belief that all living things are one. Zahelu Guy Ritchies hyperbolic ""Sherlock Holmes"" isnt a movie; its a franchise. Or at least a would-be franchise. Arthur Conan Doyles material has been grabbed by its velvet collar and thrown into twenty-first-century media culture. Such a turn was inevitable. The subdued charm of Conan Doyles hansom cabs enveloping fogs and courteous manners in which the facade of gentility is broken up so delightfully by devilish conspiracies is not of our age. In Ritchies version the facade doesnt even exist his London is rubbled and mucky with beggars underfoot and fouled by half-finished industrial monstrosities. Ritchies visual style aided by the cinematographer Philippe Rousselot is graphic-novel Victoriana there are steampunk interiors--ironworks and infernal machines with a retrofuturistic look--and dim laboratories in which everything looks rank. The movie is grimly overproduced and exhausting an irritating preposterous but fitfully enjoyable work in which every element has been inflated. The task that faces Holmes here isnt merely to solve a murder mystery but to prevent a massacre led by a black-hearted villain who wants to tyrannize England and then take back the American colonies (the bounder). The plot is perfervid hokum pumped up to justify the movies portentous look and for extra juice it has squeezed pop elements from martial-arts movies ""Fight Club"" and ""The Da Vinci Code."" There are secret rituals unspeakable practices symbols codes and many many fights. Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) bare-chested engages in Victorian extreme boxing before a howling arena of Englishmen with bad teeth. Dr. Watson (Jude Law) is a fighter too wielding cane and sabre palm and foot. The two heroes take on a variety of bruisers with karate jujitsu and for all I know Musti-Yuddha and GongKwon Yusul. Total fighting machines those Baker Street boys. The excess and the extravagance extend even to Holmes and Watsons quarters which are so cluttered that you cant pick out a single item in the chaos. But you see the two men clearly enough and Downey and Law are terrific together. For me watching them act is the movies principal pleasure. Holmes in this interpretation is an intellectual with a vast knowledge of arcane matters but hes also a brawler and a prankster and hes formidably street-smart. Downey like Johnny Depp has found a way of remaining hip in the most grossly frivolous and commercial projects--a quick wiggle of the eyes a half smile a beat or two of silence and he conveys that he realizes its all nonsense. His attitude is Yes I know but why not come along for the ride? The screenwriters Michael Robert Johnson Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg have helped create a bond between Downey and the audience with neat little jokes. Holmess famous ratiocination is now at the service of a man of action. In slow motion we see the fighting techniques he plans to use against an opponent (he narrates the blows for us insisting on the logical rightness of each one); then we see his attack again in lightning-quick flashes. Challenged by Downeys energy Jude Law who often seems aimless in his movies comes fully up to speed. Hes virile and quick-witted and his Watson if not Holmess equal in brainpower comes close to him in daring. Their repartee evokes the banter of lovers in a screwball comedy; they flirt outrageously but chastely. Watson it seems wants to get married (to Kelly Reilly of the freckled cheek and bosom) and Holmes tries to break up the engagement. He cant bear to let Watson go and Watson has some doubts too--they have always had so much fun getting into scrapes together. But Holmes eunuch-cold for years also feels the allure of a woman Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) his long-lost inamorata turns up as a criminal. At the end the principals live to fight again and Professor Moriarty who is present but mostly unseen throughout the movie waits patiently in the dark for the inevitable sequel that will reveal his face.

Shed of his tedious infatuation with off-the-peg London gangsters Ritchie proves a competent teller of the fast-paced not po-faced yarn. Here Robert Downey Jr draws on his wild-eyed side to play the detective while Jude Law assumes the more sober clothes of his sidekick Dr Watson. Plunging into their careers mid-flow we watch as they confront a conspiracy of national proportions. They discover an aristocrat Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) in the middle of a ritualistic murder of a young woman. In this early scene Ritchies Holmes reveals himself as a physical titan in a witty interlude in which we witness in slow motion the microscopic details of his plan to incapacitate an assailant by brute force. The villain hangs but for Holmes and Watson this is just the start of a series of fights rescues escapes and revelations all cloaked in creaky supernatural mumbo jumbo.Ritchies Sherlock Holmes is effective as a caricatured comedy adventure and shows some fidelity to Arthur Conan Doyle especially in Downey Jrs portrayal of the eccentric but cold-hearted Holmes. The banter between Holmes and Watson isnt as witty as it should be but the detectives lone mutterings especially his deductions are fun. The films biggest success is its evocation of Victorian London via much location work and CG rendering here Ritchies grittily romantic view of our city comes into its own culminating in a delicious climax on the girders of a half-built Tower Bridge.

Why even say something is based on books or novels when they arent? If you want to see a true adaptation see a Jeremy Brett or Peter Cushing video.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 13 2011LailaFeaturedNothing compared to Sherlock TV Series on BBC One UK. Poor poor adaptation of ACDs. What a love story? There wasnt any love story Adler loves other man. Did Guy Ritchie even read the original story?

Much of the diaglogue was hurried and slurred and couldnt always make out was was said. Sherlock looked too young for the role. Too much simulated violence and not enough detective work. Prefer ITV Poirot the film must have been poor. The set looked like a cast off from Sweeney Todd was the film made on the cheap?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 5 2010mokinatorFeaturedan alright film. pacy and humorous but not a very gripping plot.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 5 2010MikeFeaturedHey Cmon everybody. This movie is a great departure from the usual stuffy views taken by film-makers on Sherlock Holmes and his patsy sidekick Watson. What a revelation. If Downey doesnt feature in the Oscar nominations for his wonderfully comic efforts here the academy need a reality check Great special effects and a witty storyline well acted especially from all the principles with some innovative flashback thoughts of Holmes extricating himself from dodgy situations which slowed the hectic pace at the right time enough to get your breath back for a moment before being hurled along again at breakneck speed to the next plot point. Am looking forward to the sequel with anticipation. The trick now for an inspired Guy Ritchie is to make it different enough from this one to continue to captivate new audiences to Sherlock Holmes adventures without actually needing to be a Holmes fan as this one did. Very clever funny well plotted and pacy enough to satisfy all fans of the genre.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 25 2010John HFeaturedGreat Digital Effects however film a big bore.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 24 2010SueFeaturedLoved it tongue in cheek play on the boring original not a RDJ fan but thought he was great in this the plot is not to be taken seriously not the usual gory tripe everyones hooked on at the moment done in typical Ritchie style and glad to see hes back on form.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 23 2010JenFeaturedA boring film and not worth 3 stars.

Im sure they wont mind his forced accent in the States but I certainly did. Made for the US market I reckon. Shoddy. And the plot Sheesh. To make the population of London appear truly fearful (of black magic) surely you have to set them up as god-fearing to start with? Shame as Ive enjoyed some of Ritchies previous flicks. They had wit dialogue plot etc...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 18 2010ViolettaFeaturedThis is one Sherlock movie when the great detective doesnt get to do any real detecting; the Doc Watson seems to be the man with the ideas. The overall feeling of the film is a 19th Century first person shoot-them-up game melded with an obvious Hammer House of Horror script right down to the trite text book closure frames - slightly distracting at best.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 17 2010CappybearFeaturedHighly enjoyable with particularly strong performances from Downey and Law. A humorous film which steered clear of spoof; I think Conan Doyle would have approved. My wife and I look forward to the inevitable sequel.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 17 2010JanFeaturedGreat movie. Enjoyed the storyline and the cast. Would go to see it again with the family. Its not meant to be a thriller so dont expect blood and guts but the story is entertaining. Must be the first movie I have seen for a long time that doesnt have foul language in it so that made it more enjoyable..FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 13 2010BobFeaturedA great movie if one is not too hung up on the English.

Plenty of action but takes some diabolical liberties with London geography (who goes from Baker St to Pentonville via Tower Bridge?)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 11 2010oldbritFeaturedGreat scenery/CGI recreation of Victorian London. Lots of action and humour but wonderful though Robt Downey Jnr is he just isnt Sherlock Holmes. Because of the humourous treatment there is no tension and the movie flags. So much so that my wife actually fell asleep. Mark Strong was always watchable as always but even he had a comedy syrup. If I go to see the traled sequel it would only be through curiosity.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 10 2010John RFeaturedDisjointed. Poor plot. Worst still is the lead actors who can not speak clear English and slur their words. Usual US failure. Difficult to comprehend chopped words which miss middles and ends and sound levels very poor. Very disappointed. Disjointed plot - thats if there was a clear one. What is the point of bare knuckle fights ? Worst still is the very poor enunciation of words in that US actors chop their words almost to incomprehendable lengths. WE are English speakers are like to hear clear English pronunciations. I hate such actors. Why clip out middles of words and cut ends too. Very difficult to follow with other background. A boring film and not worth 3 stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 10 2010ColinFeaturedSimply awful. One these truly bad Hollywood efforts that sacrifices plot for tedious special effects. In addition Downey Junior is bad in this role. The plot is virtually non-existent and the narrative is difficuly to follow probably because it is a vehicle for the next improbable fight or explosion. I was frankly bored. Poor Sir Arthur Conan Doyle will be rolling in his grave as his subtle interested characters and plot are reduced to Hollywood formulaic mush.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 3 2010Richard HunterFeaturedA triumph of gloss over content poor characterisation badly cast lamentable narrative and a complete inability to sustain the interest of an audience. (Twelve of us aged 15-50) In short a waste of an evening... We wouldnt trade five minutes of Lock Stcok or Snatch for this sorry effort. Should have gone straight to cut price supermaket dvd.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 2 2010Andy RalphsFeaturedUsual Ritchie fare which the kids loved and I was left cold - if someone can explain the rationale for the boxing match it would be great - as far as I can tell it was a filler and an opportunity for more of the ever popular slo mo and fancy editing which adds zero to the film particularly when the scene is shown twice.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 31 2009steveFeaturedTedious. Over-long badly edited and with absolutely no sense of tension or drama. Guy Richie needs to watch a few Hitchcock films to see how it should be done. Jude Law was the best thing in it by far but even he could not disguise the gaping holes in the plot.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2009KateFeaturedVery average film - promo clip showed all the best bits and some bits that werent in it at all - seems to me a lot of this film was left on the cutting room floor and not necessarily for the better as there were gaping holes in both plot character development and pace. as ok for a rainy afternoon - but wouldnt really recommend it...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2009HRFeaturedI loved the movie Brilliant and funFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2009HRFeaturedI loved the movie Brilliant and funFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2009LivFeaturedThis film was okay. The ad shows all the best bits. I got sick of the film constantly trying to tell me that RDJrs Sherlock was quirky (especially when he wasnt) and I kept finding myself hanging out for the return of Watson as he was at least an interesting character and brightened things up a bit. Big plot holes and potentially interesting paths ignored... This film could have been a lot better. It definitely didnt achieve what it wanted to. Wont bother buying it on DVD and probably wont remember it was made once it leaves cinemas. Saying this though it was mildly entertaining for a free afternoon and it wasnt deathly boring.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2009Geoff HFeaturedI thoroughly enjoyed the movie as a fast moving action drama loosely following a Sherlock Holmes type character. Of course the character depicted by Ritchie doesnt live up to the character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle but nevertheless is an entertaining one.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 28 2009multiplexorFeaturedThis is certainly a massive change from the traditional Sherlock Holmes films but is full of action and very enjoyable.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 22 2009AntFeaturedFabulous fim.
