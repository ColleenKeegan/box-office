Peter Iliff; Release Date Wide 01/15/1999; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted January 22 1999 -- 1200 AM EST Movie stardom might be defined as the ability to play someone whos too good to be true and make that person seem just typical enough to be you. James Van Der Beek has that skill down as if born to it in the slickly enjoyable Varsity Blues. Its a conventionally plotted sports melodrama with some flashy gridiron showdowns most of them scored to jackhammer alterna-metal (yes this is an MTV Production) as well as some winky bits of adolescent sex play. But the movie is also brisk and wholehearted and smarter than you expect and it gives Van Der Beek who each week declares his mastery of pop trivia sensitively as the lead romantic moper of Dawsons Creek a chance to break out of his soft shell and show some sinew and swagger. Im not making predictions but I couldnt help but think back to another formulaic yet likable high school football movie -- All the Right Moves the 1983 sleeper in which Tom Cruise proved he could do more than boogie in his BVDs. Cruise made his shoulder-pad stud vulnerable and life-size a true guy and Van Der Beek does the same thing here. He gets you to believe in a character as idealized as Jonathan Moxon a.k.a. Mox a young Texas quarterback who can toss a football through the eye of a needle at 40 yards yet whos so noble and multifaceted that he sits on the bench during games stealing glances at a volume of Kurt Vonnegut hidden in his playbook. What a guy Mox you see is a great athlete but not quite a jock. He loves sports but hes devoted to things besides sports and in Texas (at least the Texas of Varsity Blues) thats heresy. Moxs lofty attitude doesnt win him any favors with the coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) a drawling search-and-destroy brutalizer who treats his players as if they were in permanent boot camp. (His championship trophies are combat medals.) Kilmer a control freak breeds victory through obedience and thats why he keeps the freethinking Mox on the bench. But the kid gets a break when the first-string quarterback is sidelined by an injury. The student fans are fickle -- they want a winner period -- and the moment Mox completes a crucial pass hes the new star the schools hallowed pigskin savior. Stardom of course means perks. At a convenience store the clerk offers Mox a six-pack (forget ID -- he doesnt even need cash) and the injured quarterbacks scrumptious groupie-in-heat girlfriend tries to seduce him by putting on her whipped-cream bikini (it looks exactly like it sounds). Varsity Blues has its shallow gags and cliche characters but it also creates a vivid portrait of a small-town community in the grip of an obsession. These boys fathers played for Kilmer too and theyve never relinquished their lust for glory. Theres something at once touching and fanatical in the way theyre now living through heir sons. The emotional hook of Varsity Blues is the way it presents Mox caught between his own sane vision of athletic elation and the revved-up dreams of victory his new status as a hero forces him to confront. Mox doesnt reject stardom; he grooves on it (who wouldnt?). Hes tempted as hell by his new role as high school demigod but he knows in his gut its rooted in a corrupt fixation on winning at the expense of everything else. Van Der Beek looking sleeker and cockier than he does on TV plays Moxs ambivalence beautifully. He may take the high road (he stares down the temptation of that whipped-cream bikini) but you can feel how much its killing him. The film in a sense repackages Van Der Beeks sexy-puppy earnestness but here he lets it glide by with a quizzical half smile. The director Brian Robbins has a knack for staging inspirational moments at low ebb and he brings out the best in his actors. Paul Walker as the sidelined quarterback (a victim of the coachs shoot-em-up-with-painkillers exploitation methods) gets at the essence of every teenage jock who suddenly realizes hes been living a fantasy and Ron Lester as the grossly overweight blocker Billy Bob actually does something with his cartoon role; he gives it undercurrents of self-loathing and silent honor. When Mox finally faces down the die-hard coach the ideal hes fighting for isnt original; in essence hes saying ""Its not whether you win or lose its how you play the game."" But Varsity Blues movingly taps an up-to-the-minute American mood by offering this earthly view of sports as the truest form of heroism. Playing the game the film says is all that you can do. You should consider yourself damned lucky just to be on the field. B Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

"Varsity Blues | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; varsity-blues ) Varsity Blues (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli Move aside Dennis Hopper. Step down Alan Rickman. I am now convinced that no one can match Jon Voight when it comes to playing a thoroughly detestable bad guy. With his calm sinister demeanor and menacing facial expression Voight has the ability to cause everyone in the movie theater to loathe his character. Viewers hiss when he comes on screen and cheer when he gets his comeuppance. His role as the amoral egotistical Coach Bud Kilmer in Brian Robbins Varsity Blues is such a part. This is not meant to impugn Voights acting ability. In general it takes a solid actor to make a vile villain. And although Voight is capable of playing good guys that hasnt been his forte of late. A glance at his recent resume reveals a veritable rogues gallery of criminals corrupt government officials and backstabbers the architect of the cover-up in Enemy of the State the big business lawyer in The Rainmaker the conscienceless general in Most Wanted the sinister snake catcher in Anaconda and the traitorous Jim Phelps in Mission Impossible. With Varsity Blues Voight pours himself into yet another such portrayal and during those scenes when hes on screen his energy level elevates the movie. Unfortunately Voight is not in every scene and when hes absent Varsity Blues has a tendency to flounder descending into the realm of formulaic sports movie melodrama. Although the film takes a worthwhile detour or two it ultimately finds its way back to the well-worn track of its genre. In the end everything is wrapped up in a too-predictable manner. While the tangents and character quirks keep Varsity Blues interesting for a surprising stretch of its running time it is ultimately undermined by the need to conclude with a ""big moment."" Here as is often the case writers and directors are unwilling to take a chance with an ending that might be artistically satisfying but not crowd pleasing. Varsity Blues takes place in West Canaan Texas where football is a way of life. In the words of the protagonist and narrator John ""Mox"" Moxen (James Van Der Beek) ""As a boy growing up in West Canaan you never question the sanctity of football... Its win at all costs."" Mox is the backup quarterback for the West Canaan Coyotes the high school varsity team. Under their coach Bud Kilmer they have a sterling record. In his 30 year tenure the team has won 22 district championships. This year Kilmer intends to make it 23 and he thinks he has the players to do so starting with his star quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker). Unfortunately the coachs need to win has become an obsession and it causes him to push his players into doing unsafe things (like taking drugs to numb pain). When Lance goes down with a serious injury Mox has to step into the breach. He soon finds himself torn between his sudden celebrity status and his desire to stage an uprising against the coach. James Van Der Beek of TVs ""Dawsons Creek"" plays Mox as a basically noble character who falls prey to a few of the enticements of his heady new position. He is faced with some pretty strong temptations too including a girl dressed only in a whipped cream bikini a car full of naked women and an all-night party at a strip joint. Theres no doubt that were supposed to identify with Mox but Van Der Beek is careful to allow his flaws to emerge - hes not so admirable that he sickens us. Still in those scenes when Van Der Beek faces off against Voight its immediately clear whos the veteran and whos the newcomer. The other performers including Amy Smart as Moxs girlfriend Ali Larter as a blond bombshell and Ron Lester as the overweight Billy Bob are on Van Der Beeks level - adequate except when opposite Voight. Taken as a whole Varsity Blues is not completely without merit. Moxs moral dilemma while not the substance of great drama is moderately engaging. His sudden superstardom bestows a false sense of indestructibility upon him and his newfound arrogance brings him into conflict with the coach. He must also determine whether his football success offers him enough of a future in the sport to derail his plans to attend an Ivy League school. And of course there are romantic complications (although these are played out with a minimum of melodrama). Missteps in Varsity Blues include a painfully inept subplot involving Moxs younger brother who is obsessed with different religions (this is supposed to offer comic relief) a tangent featuring a sex ed teacher who strips on the side and the trite ending. The final fifteen minutes force-feed us with an unfortunate resolution that devaluates this movie from the level of solid entertainment to a sporadically enjoyable diversion.

My theory has always been that people in the South riled up as some of them apparently still are for having lost the Civil War arrange for their kids to get down and win a battle every Friday night while Mom and Dad sit in the stands their heads and hearts swelling until theyre about to burst. (Those marching bands arent playing ""Dixie"" after every touchdown because its a catchy melody you know.) Theatrical preview for ""Varsity Blues"" Windows Media 28k or 56k Real 28k or 56k Clip ""Stealing the car"" Video clip 2Mb QuickTime You might be chuckling about that but anybody whos ever been around this kind of mindset knows that its not as farfetched as it sounds. The near-religious emphasis put on the old punt pass and kick also enables people who are improperly pigeonholed as dumb farmers to climb a social ladder of their own devising. If you cant be Elvis you might as well be a quarterback. And if you cant be a quarterback well you might as well be a dumb farmer. Football-crazed South Brian Robbins ""Varsity Blues"" is set in arguably the most football-crazed part of this country Texas home of the Alamo crushed Armadillos and the Cowboys (Dallas variety). The small-town setting is captured to perfection; every available space is painted up in school colors and beer-bellied former players arent satisfied with merely attending games -- they also have to watch the practices. But Robbins (and MTV films a company thats now scored a teen-age pandering trifecta with ""Joes Apartment"" ""Dead Man on Campus"" and this thing) treats the people of this town as barely-coherent rubes. (Some of the accents are so country-fried theyd embarrass Jethro Bodine.) The emotional complexity of why everyones going nuts over a bunch of kids running around with an inflated piece of leather is never questioned for a second; its just a fact. Thats shallow enough but the most offensive thing about the movie is how it repeatedly pretends to be a morality tale while spending most of its time marching out the sexy fillies and having the kids get drunk drunker and drunkest. This isnt a movie about the corruptible influence of high school football; its a movie about how cool it is to get wasted especially when all the girls in your town look like Shania Twain. A star QB a glory-hungry coach Teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek stars as John Moxon the lowly backup quarterback for a team thats marching its way to yet another conference championship courtesy of their star QB Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) and their glory-hungry coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight). Voight is once again locked into crazed-authority-figure mode and sports the Southern accent that hes apparently very pleased to have perfected. (He uses it in so many movies its a wonder he didnt ladle it on when he played an Irish policeman in ""The General."") Theres also the usual collection of hootin and hollerin teammates who practically own the town and drive around in a pickup truck with the humorously fat players pet pig sitting on the seat next to them. The story is exactly what you think itll be once you understand how big a star Harbor is and just how much Coach Kilmer despises that Moxon boy. (He catches him reading ""Slaughterhouse Five"" on the sidelines instead of studying his playbook. At least the kids got good taste.) Harbor goes down of course with a career-ending knee injury and Moxon comes in off the bench scrambling like Fran Tarkenton and passing like an adolescent Johnny Unitas. Its a minor complaint when stacked up against the industrial-strength foolishness of the rest of the movie but how could this kid be openly ridiculed and forced to sit on the bench all season long when hes capable of scrambling away from an entire team of defenders and laying the ball over his receivers shoulders 45 yards downfield? Moxon starts to believe his own press after a while turning his back on his sweet little girlfriend soon after hes given free beer by a local merchant is besieged with admirers at the burger joint and Playmate-material Texas girls strip off right there in front of him and rub whipped cream all over their erogenous zones. Too much sex and alcohol For every two minutes of moralizing that screenwriters John Gatins and W. Peter Iliff squeeze into their script you get 20 minutes of booze-fueled hootchy-cootchy. The amount of drinking is astonishing -- teen-age binges are portrayed as somewhat negative behavior but nothing more than that especially if you win your game the next day. In fact the only time the boozing is portrayed in a truly negative light is when a loss occurs because of it. The scene during which the demon alcohol is imbibed almost defies description. Early in the movie we see the guys in a sex education class thats being taught by a prim overly drawling teacher. The minute you lay eyes on her you can tell that shes actually a hot number under all that stuffy clothing and you have to figure shes going to let her hair down and take off her granny glasses at some point. Well she does take them off along with everything else. Van Der Beek and his teammates head out to a strip club the night before a supposedly easy-to-win game and who do you think comes prancing out to the strains of Van Halens ""Hot for Teacher?"" No its not Jenny McCarthy -- its their sex education teacher And shes a babe After her dance she sits down and has a shot of whiskey with her students while they make lecherous comments. Despite living in a small no-secrets town this woman has somehow managed to pull off a double life that would make Marv Albert proud. Howd she do that? The fact of the matter is nobody in the audience is supposed to care how she did it because hey shes stacked Understand Im as happy to ogle Playmate-material Texas girls as the next (heterosexual) guy maybe even happier but this thing is supposed to be teaching kids a lesson. And it does I suppose. The lesson is that you can make a ton of money in this country by appealing to the baser instincts of lecherous teen-agers. If you consider the need for unearned adulation to be one of mankinds baser instincts the good folks at MTV are doing the very thing thats supposed to be making Voights character so evil. ""Using Kids for Fun and Profit"" is a far more accurate title for the movie. Someone should throw a flag. I cant overstate how much drinking and sex goes on in ""Varsity Blues."" Theres bad language nudity both male and female and a cavalier attitude towards getting so blasted you have to puke into a nearby washing machine. Im just wondering where they get these teachers.

We also know that at some point the hero will choose not to have sex with the prettiest cheerleader in town even though shell come at him naked and covered only in whipped cream. He will stay virtuous even though hes 17 and pumping hormones like a blowfish. Knowing this we are aware going in that ""Varsity Blues"" cannot be a landmark of world cinema. Yet working within the tired formula the picture which opens today turns out to be not so bad. Its the little extras that raise ""Var sity Blues"" to the heights of slightly better than mediocre. The film takes place in Texas and every effort is made to convey a sense of what high school means to small-town folks in the Southwest. It means a heck of a lot apparently. It means that maybe these people ought to get a life. With his shoe-button eyes and nice-kid appeal James Van Der Beek (of TVs ""Dawsons Creek"") plays Jonathan the teams second- string quarterback who becomes an instant celebrity when the teams star quarterback gets injured. All of a sudden young Jon owns the town. Merchants are giving him free beer and hes being let into strip clubs. Its an awesome turnaround but Jonathan looks as if he can handle it. For one thing he looks closer to 25 than 17. The best feature of ""Varsity Blues"" is that the coach is not some crusty but lovable authoritarian but an angry maniac who pumps his athletes full of painkillers and makes them play when theyre sick or injured. Jon Voight portrays him as an irredeemable louse a genuinely dangerous man. Before the big game the coach tells his players that theyll remember the next 48 minutes for the next 48 years. Thats a lie of course. Within 20 years theyll forget entirely who won the game but they will regret fumbling away their chance with the naked cheerleader. Forever.

"Varsity Blues (R) Related Item ""Varsity Blues"" showtimes Varsity Blues By Mike Musgrove Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 15 1999 Football player James Van Der Beek is coached by Jon Voight in ""Varsity Blues."" (Paramount) Director Brian Robbins Cast James Van Der Beek; Scott Caan; Thomas F. Duffy; Ali Larter; Ron Lester; Joe Pichler; Amy Smart; Jon Voight; Paul Walker; Eliel Swinton Running Time 1 hour 40 minutes Some profanity boozing and a trip to a strip joint In the small Texas town of West Canaan football is all that matters to most folks. Coach Kilmer (Jon Voight) is a nasty high school coach who pushes his kids far past their breaking points and his star quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) ends up in the hospital minus a football career as a result. Enter Jonathan ""Mox"" Moxon (James Van Der Beek of ""Dawsons Creek"" fame) a nice guy who has spent most of his senior year warming the bench because the coach doesnt like his attitude. With just five games left in the season its finally Moxs turn to shine. And what do you know it turns out that the kid can play too. There are more moral lessons strewn along here than in an afterschool special but a few variations in the football movie template keep things interesting. ""Varsity Blues"" however is ultimately about the same things that football movies are always about loyalty friendship how hard it is to understand chicks sometimes and how fun it is to get the requisite fat guy drunk. The football miracle at the end is pure fantasy but for that matter so is a football team that consists entirely of such lovable guys. This flick has modest ambitions but it delivers the goods in a fresh manner.

Think of ""Porkys"" with pigskins and youve got ""Varsity Blues"" an unappetizing mix of raucously vulgar comedy and teen-angst melodrama. Paramount may attract teenage ticket buyers and score an OK opening weekend thanks to an aggressive ad campaign and the casting of ""Dawsons Creek"" heartthrob James Van Der Beek. After that however expect a quick fumble at the box office followed by a punt to more promising ancillary venues. In choosing to focus on the excitement and excesses of high-school football culture in small-town Texas screenwriter W. Peter Iliff lays claim to subject matter ripe with dramatic and comedic possibilities. At its extremely infrequent best pic persuasively nails the details of life in a place where parents and other alumni savor vicarious thrills through the triumphs of young gridiron stars. In this overheated environment a star quarterback might have his very own billboard on his front lawn the local police will likely ignore the worst mischief of teen athletes -- and a winning coach can get away with an appalling amount of verbal and physical abuse. Unfortunately much of ""Varsity Blues"" is little more than standard-issue teen sex-comedy nonsense complete with clueless parents overbearing authority figures beer-swilling neer-do-wells jokes about vomit and flatulence -- and of course an abundance of young pliant females who appear topless seminude or in one case strategically dabbed with whipped cream. (The closing credits acknowledge such notable characters as ""Teen Babe 1"" and ""Cute Naked Girl."") Theres also a sex-education teacher (Tonie Perensky) who moonlights as an exotic dancer at a strip club where -- surprise -- shes viewed by her awestruck students. Directed with uninspired vigor by Brian Robbins (""Good Burger"") ""Varsity Blues"" follows the character-building misadventures of Jonathan ""Mox"" Moxon (James Van Der Beek) a hunky but sensitive high school senior in West Canaan Texas. Although hes the second-string quarterback for the West Canaan Coyotes he doesnt take football very seriously -- to the annoyance of his image-conscious father (Thomas F. Duffy) and the hard-charging Coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight). But when first-string quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) is felled by a season-ending injury Mox must rise to the occasion and lead his team through its few final games. At first he is amused by the abrupt elevation in status -- convenience-store clerks give him free beer reporters pester him for soundbites a billboard appears on his front lawn. But his girlfriend Julie (Amy Smart) -- who just happens to be Lances sister -- fears her sweet and sensitive guy is turning into a swaggering jock. Meanwhile Lances own girlfriend (Ali Larter) decides to hitch her wagon among other things to another rising star. Van Der Beek gives a fine performance allowing all the contradictions of his character to emerge. Mox is introduced as a bright and vaguely rebellious young man who presumably plays football only because everyone in town expects him to. When he gets a taste of glory he understandably reconsiders his preconceptions about playing and winning. But the script calls for Mox to do some patently stupid things -- like bring his buddies to the aforementioned strip club on the night before a big game -- that seem totally out of character. Julie self-righteously berates Mox for daring to enjoy his local-hero celebrity. (Smart tries hard but her character comes across as a real pill.) But Mox insists that hes more concerned with winning a scholarship to Brown University than with racking up points on the playing field. In the melodramatic climax of ""Varsity Blues"" Mox lead a team rebellion against Coach Wilkins an obsessive tyrant who thinks nothing of risking the long-term health of injured players. Once Wilkins is ejected from the locker room however Mox delivers a rah-rah speech in which he extols his comrades to ""play like gods."" The obvious message You should reject a win-at-all-costs mentality but only if you can still manage to win. Through sheer force of acting skill Voight conveys some semblance of complexity in and imparts a sense of authenticity to thinly written character suggesting that Wilkins too feels tremendous pressure from the West Canaan community. Other supporting players of note if not accomplishment include Ron Lester as an enormously husky lineman who keeps a pet pig and swigs maple syrup from the bottle and Scott Caan as a hellraising Coyote who steals a police car and fills it with naked sophomore girls. Music supervisors G. Marq Roswell and Gary Calamar have assembled a solid soundtrack -including Collective Souls ineffably haunting ""Run"" -- that should generate impressive CD sales. Lenser Charles Cohen makes the most of locations in and around Austin Texas while editor Ned Bastille enhances the uncommon verisimilitude of the football sequences. Other tech credits are pro.
