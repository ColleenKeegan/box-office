Report Chandler Parsons  Next The Not Quite Midseason Awards Courtesy of Warner Bros Facebook Twitter Print Die Hard Die Die Die Die Die Yeah so the new John McClane joint aint so hot. Plus The rest of the week in movies. by Wesley Morris on February 15 2013 Should an action movie care? Should it care to do more than send a state-of-the-art helicopter sinking out of the sky because theres an armored truck dangling chained from its cargo bay? Should it care that as inventive a stunt as that weighed-down chopper might be it is alas only a stunt in a film littered with similar stunts? Should it care that an audience might need more than cars that fly off one level of a Russian highway only to cause mayhem when they land on the road below that we might need actual screenwriting to give some sense and structure to all that chaos? A Good Day to Die Hard is an action movie and it definitely doesnt care. This is the fifth and least of the Die Hard movies. Its most loving imagery all involves people and vehicles falling to the ground. One of those falling people finds the mental clarity to thrust up his middle finger on his way down. Thats supposed to be a rousing moment of triumph but its just a depressing show of contempt -- for the audience for the genre and the series. The movie never earns the right to be so cavalier. The bird-flipper is Bruce Williss John McClane the NYPD detective who became an iconic movie hero in the first three Die Hard movies outsmarting and outliving terrorists and a cartoon by the fourth. Its not simply his indestructibility that now makes him less than real (his die-hardness has never been up for debate). But for at least the first three movies the excitement came from both McClanes vulnerability and epic lucklessness (he was once allegedly just a cop). Bad news and worse people -- Europeans all -- refused to stop intruding on his already dysfunctional life. In these last two terribly titled movies (2007s Live Free or Die Hard stunk up screens a dozen years after the urban fun and racial daring of Die Hard With a Vengeance which actually began life as a Brandon Lee thriller called Simon Says) McClane has gone completely bald and turned into a kind of disaster junkie. Hes as turned on by mass destruction as the nutjobs we expect him to vanquish. Originally Willis was something new for the action movie which had been defined by old-guard right-wingers and muscly monosyllabic ethnics. He was this little blue-collar smart-ass with a receding hairline. What he lacked in physicality he made up for in attitude. When the first Die Hard arrived in the late summer of 1988 Willis was known as the guy bantering with Cybill Shepherd on ABCs Moonlighting. His charm came from his seeming both mildly drunk and slightly hungover. He was louche and sleazy and cocky but not secure enough to believe that he was more charismatic than she was. That of course made him kind of sexy He wanted her approval and by extension ours. Putting Willis at the scene of a hostage situation where one of the hostages was McClanes wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) with the scene being a Los Angeles skyscraper gave his macho street intelligence potentially a real challenge Could he take out an entire gang of Germanic evil? The excitement of Willis in these first three movies was how he kept surprising himself. He seemed to have no idea what he was doing until he was doing it. But the directors -- John McTiernan for the first and third; Renny Harlin for the outrageous second -- understood how to take a formula thriller and proceed as though the world had never seen a heist movie. They had clever-enough scripts that bumped up the scale -- terrorists in our buildings our airports our subways -- without sacrificing our ability to relate to the stakes or navigate the action. Will McClane save Holly? Will he save New York? Its hard to appreciate but Die Hard was such a mold-breaking hit that it made most action movies strive almost parodically for its formula. Speed was Die Hard on a bus. Cliffhanger was Die Hard on a mountain. Virtuosity was Die Hard in cyberspace. Setting aside mild-mannered suspense dramas like 1974s The Taking of Pelham One Two Three Die Hard was the action-movie Big Bang. Whats remarkable about all three movies is their attention to pacing and setup. In the first film theres so much going on in and around the Nakatomi building that creates tension and suspense for McTiernan to exploit. Each establishes precisely the terms of the various conflicts so that once the action gets under way its inextricable from the drama thats driving it. The chases and murders and explosions are part of the narrative. This is also known as storytelling and its virtually extinct in the action movies current iteration. By 2007 the action movie was thinking more globally. The North American box office was no longer enough. These movies werent content with saving Manhattan. They had to save the world mostly by hopping from one time-stamped locale to the next. But to work on that scale a movie needs a prevailing scope a sense not only that the planet is big but an idea of how the heroes fit within all that borderlessness. Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol is a wonderful example of how an internationalist franchise had found a way to work globally yet with some humor and intimacy. A Good Day to Die Hard is set in Moscow but has a plot that changes its mind. A political prisoner plot becomes an international intrigue plot which becomes an epic terrorism plot. With each narrative costume change the location becomes increasingly beside the point. Never mind that most of the later action involves Chernobyl a specific notorious Russian location thats treated with little reverence for the atrocity thats left it such a barren wasteland. How the movie gets here isnt important Basically McClanes estranged adult son Jack (Jai Courtney) is a spy shepherding a Russian oppositionist (Sebastian Koch) first to retrieve an important file and then to his sexy daughter and then to safety. McClane heads to Moscow to see Jack and winds up a gleeful participant in highway demolition derbies and elaborate shootouts. But the movie is determined to force the drama of this story into some kind of father-son reconciliation. John turns goopy with resentment. Jacks eyes begin to well up with the tears of a son who misses the father he spends an hour saying he hates. Of all the illogic on display in this movie (is neutralizing radiation as possible as it is here?) the sentiment curdling between these two is the most galling -- mainly since its the least of the reasons weve come. None of it seems to bother Willis though. He looks happy to be in a movie he can dominate with his smirk. Despite McClanes no longer being a smoker Willis does things with his face that make it appear as though hes taking long satisfying drags on an unseen cigarette. But hes much better than this sort of payday exercise. Did he not see himself in Looper or Moonrise Kingdom? He doesnt have much else to do here beyond shoot and smirk. Covered in blood and broken glass he seems superfluous. The movie is more a showcase for the stunt team and the effects department and their work especially during all the slow-motion absurdity of the finale is often stunning. Its cheap dissatisfying and sad -- a blockbuster with Die Hard flavoring. For what its worth the director is John Moore working from a rickety script by Skip Woods. Moore is competent but he might as well be designing one of the video games thats spun off from this franchise. There are all of the mechanics and rote villainy (one of the Eurobaddies chomps on a carrot and declares his contempt for America) but no higher (or even lower) purpose to speak of. We get all the seriess destruction with none of the plot character actors suspense coherence or tank tops of the first three movies. Its cheap dissatisfying and sad -- a blockbuster with Die Hard flavoring. This fifth installment actually embodies what Sylvester Stallones two Expendables films should have obviated -- action stars of yesterday fighting their obsolescence by going back to basics. But that of course was the problem with those movies Stallone wasnt sending up old action films; he was trying to revive dead or dying careers. Last month brought Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Last Stand and Stallone in Bullet to the Head and nobody cared. Willis at least is simply leaning on something familiar. Still you cant blame any of them. Theyve surveyed the landscape of action-star alternatives and seen no one younger who threatens them. Take this Jai Courtney. Hes a young physically fit Australian whos uncomfortably Tom Hardy-like (its the eyes lips and vaguely disguised non-American accent). But hes not anything else. I dont know that he could carry a franchise on his own. Almost no ones expected to now. The effects departments are the new stars. And the flesh-and-blood men who could carry an action movie -- the Hugh Jackmans Channing Tatums and Dwayne Johnsons -- are too good at other stuff to purely Stallone themselves. The version of the action movie that Willis and his ilk helped popularize is on its last legs. A jalopy like A Good Day to Die Hard merely italicizes its demise. Ladies its Valentines weekend. And some of you might want to spend part of it at the movies. Hollywood thinks its got two winners for you each based on a popular book and set in the South. The first is Safe Haven which began as a Nicholas Sparks novel and depending on how you take your romantic dramas is either the equivalent of a warm bath or a sink full of dishes. Sparks has cornered the market on love in sleepy seaside towns. The grubby tragedy of his first books (The Notebook A Walk to Remember) has morphed into the kind of New Age nonsense that when faithfully produced on screen can cause you to spit out your Pepsi. The glorious badness of Safe Haven comes from the way the veteran director Lasse Hallstrom applies the greeting-card tastefulness hes used for Whats Eating Gilbert Grape Something to Talk About The Cider House Rules Chocolat Dear John and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen to a movie whose punch line is so delightfully absurd that even after you pretty much know whats coming you spit out your Pepsi anyway. Julianne Hough plays a young woman who desperately flees Boston by bus hops off in Southport North Carolina and gives herself a new name (Katie) and haircut (Mary Stuart Masterson). She rents a great house gets a job at the local seafood shack makes pals with another single lady (a lifeless-looking Cobie Smulders) and falls for the hunky widower (Josh Duhamel) who runs The Only Store in Town. His name is Alex and he cant seem to understand why it takes so long for his hotness and the cuteness of his two kids to occur to her. But we know why. We have flashbacks. ""Katie"" is running from an abusive drunk (David Lyons) who we see in separate scenes harassing people for Katies whereabouts. You think you know where this is headed -- and youre mostly right. The abuser gets to Southport in time for the Fourth of July But theres more. This is the sort of movie (based on the sort of book) in which Alexs late wife took the time to write a letter to her children which theyre to open in their teenage years. Its the sort of movie in which she also bothered to pen one for ""the woman my husband loves"" or something like that. Theyve been written on paper that doesnt appear to burn in a house fire. And when Katie opens hers youll feel bad that you had to spit soda all over it. But theres no other choice What the letter implies is ridiculous. What the story pulls back to reveal at that moment -- and no I wont spoil it though you can probably guess -- is even more so. What the movie thinks is a loving piety is really just celestial dreariness saved up for a big plot twist. I dont know whod want to spend Valentines weekend this way with the Keyser Soze of seaside romance. Of course that would be vastly preferable to the other movie that opened on February 14. Its something called Beautiful Creatures in which a teenage Southerner falls for a girl who turns out to be a witch except because Beautiful Creatures is based on a series of young adult novels you cant call her a witch. You have to call her a ""Caster."" The boy Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) cant take things too far with the girl Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) because she wont quite let him. Lena lives with her extended family in a mansion that looks like the gothic version of the surrealist house in Beetlejuice. She hails from a line of powerful Casters and upon her 16th birthday shell be ready for The Reaping some kind of transformational rite in which her soul her fate or possibly her hair color will forever be ""dark or light."" And because the entire point of movies based on young adult fiction appears to be that nothing can be called what it is no one ever surmises that really all the Reaping seems to be is either a garden party for your period or a very public acknowledgment that you might have a mental illness. (It might also be both.) Beautiful Creatures is like the Twilight movies but with a chaperone making sure the boys dance a foot apart from the girls. (Twilight allows for heavy petting and then intercourse.) Its loosely like The Hunger Games but with nothing thoughtful to say about violence or popular culture or making something of yourself. The film feels very much the result of many people -- the novelists Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl; the writer and director Richard LaGravenese; the assortment of producers; and Warner Bros. -- taking stock of the young adult landscape and saying ""We can do that."" I would beg to differ. Very few movies based on so-called YA fiction is very good. The last two Twilight movies are difficult to watch in part because the filmmaking drags one minute and is on cocaine the next. But you at least believed that this hot girl wanted to do it so much with this one undead guy that shed risk her life. Its a stupid confused way to look at sex but at least it felt that way with a modicum of conviction. I dont know how Beautiful Creatures feels about anything. Theres no central drama or suspense. Theres no sexual tension or eroticism or real comedy (although the night I saw it the girls in the audience seemed to find Ehrenreich appealing). Theres some overwrought business involving Civil War reenactments and the alarming image of scars on Viola Daviss back which evokes a slave masters lash. But theyre glossed over in a way thats shocking coming from a man who helped turn Toni Morrisons Beloved into a movie. Its more stuff youre not allowed to call by its name. None of the actors at the center of the movie inspires anything close to enthusiasm. And there isnt one beautiful image in the whole film. The effects actually have a sludgy muddy quality so when Lena and her estranged Little Red Corvette of a sister (Emmy Rossum) have a shouting match that makes the dinner table rise up off the floor and spin around its like watching a pottery wheel lose its mind. The bright frilly costumes and makeup give naturalist actors like Eileen Atkins and Margo Martindale a creepiness they shouldnt have. (You havent felt truly sorry for an actor until youve seen Martindale in a big cottony wig. She looks like dessert.) Jeremy Irons appears to be enjoying himself as Lenas hammy uncle. Davis makes the most of whats basically another caretaker (her characters name is Amma which practically begs for rearrangement at the Soul Train Scramble Board) and Emma Thompson as Lenas evil mother attempts to tear the roof off the movie. Its unclear what shes going for but whatever it is its unserious which ought to win her something. Beautiful Creatures is what would happen if Tim Burton tried to film a William Faulkner novel as though it were Sabrina the Teenage Witch. (That makes either Irons or Davis the talking cat.) These movies -- and the so-called YA novels that inspire them -- wind up taking real adolescent experiences (losing your virginitys a big one) and larding it with all kinds of fantastical danger that perverts the actual meaning of that experience. The directness and piquancy in the music of Alanis Morissette Liz Phair PJ Harvey and Tori Amos have retarded into euphemisms for lust. The piss and vinegar of the 1990s have dried up. A decade later girls hormonal-emotional surrogates in books and movies arent getting mad even or straightforwardly laid. Theyre getting reaped.

Mikesaid on Friday March 29 2013 100308 PMsupposed to be in Russia but did you see one Lada or Moscovich? Steven Freekinsaid on Saturday February 23 2013 124105 AMI was actually looking forward to this movie since the last one was surprisingly good. However this new installment was utterly stupid mindless predictable and a good day to forget this movie was ever made. Wow can the writing be any worse can the cinematography be any amateurish and embarrassing can acting be any corny and cartoonish and can the directing be any sophomoric and incompetent? The answer is F en YES I give it an F-. Eric Hutchisonsaid on Friday February 22 2013 92351 PMJenny Sloan no offense meant to you at all but the ""Die Hard"" franchise wasnt always JUST silly and campy. The original 1988 movie in particular did a great job of connecting the audience emotionally to the McClane character and his plight. He wasnt a ""superhero"" type of action hero. He was a real person with real-life problems and you truly were given the sense that he was in grave danger the entire movie. You really felt like he may not make it out of there alive. The second movie was more like the new one detached from what made the first movie so good. When the original director John McTiernan came back for the third movie the quality picked up again. The fourth one we all know about with its PG-13 softness and such and the current one is just in a league of its own in terms of disaster. Ill give it to you that no ""Die Hard"" movie would be considered as ""art"" but in the action/thriller genre the first movie is one of the best ever made. Everything since then has been a mixed bag. Jonathan Reynoldssaid on Friday February 22 2013 72247 AMYoure pretty generous with the D+. A Good Day to Die Hard is sadly one of the worst movies in memory. The only fun to be had was in mocking it. John Doesaid on Thursday February 21 2013 51849 PMWow What a surprise Yet another shitty Die Hard sequel. And released in mid February no less. Richsaid on Thursday February 21 2013 105433 AMIncredibly disappointing. Bruce should be embarassed to have been involved in this.

Its tempting to think that the writers and director had nodded out at about the same point but its harder to do something you dont believe in -- dont you find? The director John Moore is not a hack If nothing else he created a distinctively whooshy syntax in Max Payne (which flopped) and I loved his clean desert palette in his undersung remake of Flight of the Phoenix. But A Good Day to Die Hard is the opposite of a labor of love. It has no good lines no crackerjack fights and only one mildly orgasmic revenge killing. It will satisfy no one -- high- low- or middlebrow. Die Hard is finally in its death throes. After a stylish mishmash of a prologue set in Moscow John McClane gets the news at a shooting range that his estranged son has been taken prisoner by the Russkies. He says something to the effect of ""Kids ... yknow ... better see whats going on"" but theres no sense of urgency about it either in the U.S. or when he gets to Moscow. (Liam Neeson would have wasted a dozen people before he left the airport.) Then the explosions begin and McClane is suddenly face to face with his son who (spoiler) (Okay no spoiler if youve seen the preview or commercial) is actually a trained CIA agent fighting to liberate a political prisoner (Sebastian Koch a lifetime away from The Lives of Others) from the Putin-esco government. His fathers appearance screws up his timetable so Jr. Sr. and the Russian are suddenly on their own -- with doncha know many double-crosses and double-double-crosses down the roadskie to the climax in Chernobyl which McLane cracks looks like Newark. Funny. Corey Booker says hey Bruce. Visit anytime. McClane Jr. calls McClane Sr. ""John"" instead of Dad which is nowhere near as hurtful (or emasculating) as McClanes wife Holly going by her maiden name in Die Hard. But it points to the movies token emotional arc whether McClane will show his son hes a strong father. This he does by proving himself right and his son wrong at every turn. Willis has taken risks in his career -- played bad guys acted in serious movies with little hope of making serious money -- but in pictures like this hes in selfish-superstar mode. Its always McClane -- the street-smart New York cop -- who smells something fishy while his son blunders blindly ahead. McClane acts the martyr (""Kids"") and then when Jr. appears to be licked taunts his son by asking if he wants a warm glass of milk with some Bosco in it. Then its the family that slays together etc. ""Thats what we do"" he exhorts his kid. ""Get out and kill all the scumbags."" Willis has rarely been better than he was in John McTiernans Die HardA -- barefoot bloodied blackened limping toward the peeved but amazed villain (the peerless Alan Rickman) and bellowing for his wife. (Bonnie Bedelia where art thou?) The movie was brilliantly plotted and all that glass raining down made you giddy. But there were on the other hand those Cro-Magnon politics the maiden name thing (only when McClane kills the bad guy will she identify herself as Holly McClane) the media bashing the cop Al who recovers his manhood by shooting someone -- red-meat right-wing tropes. In A Good Day to Die Hard theres a conspicuous Obama portrait in the shooting range followed by a villains taunt that its not 1986 anymore that Ronald Reagan is dead and America has no more power or stature. But that kind of liberal baiting is so limp that you have to laugh Is that all you got? Action freaks will be surprised at how lame this is given that the last Die Hard film Live Free or Die Hard had an inventive setup (Timothy Olyphant as enraged super-hacker who sabotages the infrastructure) an amusing sidekick for McClane in Justin Long and an outlandish but well-sustained fight in a giant data center. I didnt care much for Willis going bald not because hed look better with a rug but because he suddenly seemed more like rich hipster Bruce than working-class McClane. But the movie did the job. A Good Day to Die Hard doesnt. It has a passable fight in an empty ballroom and a nice comeuppance for one villain whos whirred by a helicopter blade into a human smoothie. But thats it. I think I fell asleep to keep from getting even more depressed. Every scene is a little death.

Mostly theres Willis a crafty trouper when it comes to the ""Im getting too old for this stuff"" shtick.With his arsenal of smirks deepening creases around those mischievous eyes and a sheen of polish developed from his welcome stints as a character actor (most recently in Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom) Willis wears his AARP eligibility with a self-awareness that outstrips his latest exercise in nostalgic bloodshed.If you think they dont make enough father-son movies with overwrought truck stunts then this is your lucky Day. Massive vehicles fly through the air blast into each other and in one case dangle from a helicopter. The good guys Willis wrong-place wrong-time cop John McClane and his CIA son Jack (Jai Courtney) take improbable tumbles make small talk heal old emotional wounds and dust themselves off. The bad guys Russians every one double-cross all comers (including one another) before going down for good. The most colorful of the lot played by Radivoje Bukvic would rather be a dancer than a killer.On one level you have to admire the brazenness of an action movie that acts like the Cold War never ended. Whats a franchise to do when it needs an Evil Empire? (One option employed by the folks behind the laughable Red Dawn remake Turn the bad guys into North Koreans.) Familiarity is the main draw for any meat-and-potatoes franchise that hopes to bring loyal fans back to the table. Its not like anyone goes to a Die Hard movie looking for something completely different. Anyway this series was always more inclined to demonize Germany.A Good Day is actually more interested in filial games than geopolitics. The junior McClane resents Pop for being an absentee father. Meanwhile a Russian political prisoner (Sebastian Koch) and his duplicitous daughter (Yuliya Snigir) plot beeg trouble for moose and squirrel against the backdrop of a slate-gray Budapest standing in for Moscow. Its so nice to see parents take the time to play with their kids.Its all more than a little silly but Willis presence at least provides undercurrents of easy jocularity. Its the same old gag -- a regular dude just wants to live his life if only villains would stop plotting mass destruction -- but Willis winks along without wearing out his welcome. Hes recently suggested more installments are forthcoming which only makes sense. Old action stars no longer fade away. They take their time and die hard.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(Photo/Video Sony Pictures Classics) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Feb. 14 2013 637 p.m. ET How often does a new movie go out of its way to look dated? Maybe as often as the word no takes on positive meaning. Both cases apply to Pablo Larrains ""No"" an exceptionally smart political drama with a satirical edge about the 1988 referendum that drove the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet out of office. In the run-up to the vote the No campaign--a coalition of Pinochets opponents--chose a rainbow logo for its signature and delivered its media message with exuberantly upbeat television spots. Saying no to another term for Pinochet who had been in power for 15 years was equated with saying yes to a democratic future. Against massive odds the nays carried the day and Pinochet was sent packing. To portray that turning point in Chiles history Mr. Larrain and his cinematographer Sergio Armstrong found long-obsolete video cameras of the period and pressed them into service. The results will seem a bit blurry to contemporary eyes but usefully so. Everything on screen--new sequences involving the star Gael Garcia Bernal; old TV footage including the feel-good spots; restaged events and ingenious recreations of archival material--blends together into a past thats eerily present. In the process factuality has also been blurred ""No"" an Oscar contender in subtitled Spanish should be seen as fiction grounded in historical events. But that doesnt diminish its value. Like ""Argo"" or ""Zero Dark Thirty"" the film dramatizes a fertile subject--in this instance the language of advertising in modern politics. Mr. Bernal is Rene Saavedra a Santiago advertising executive whos too old to be called a whiz kid though still young enough to navigate the citys streets on a skateboard. As the movie opens hes about to hit the start button for a demo that he knows will be troubling for the client so he offers an earnest assurance that his presentation ""is in line with the current social context"" and an assertion that Chiles citizens ""have raised their demands in regard to truth in regard to what they like."" The product in question is Free a soda pop celebrated in the commercial with images of gleeful guzzlers that include dancers and rockers plus a blissed-out mime. The elaborate presentation of the frivolous package is enjoyable in itself but the sequence also serves as a perfect setup for a serious payoff since the commercials aesthetic differs little from the ads that Rene soon creates with the same assurance of social relevance for the No side of the referendum. (To clarify the historical context this is four years after Ronald Reagans legendarily effective ""Its morning again in America"" campaign ad.) Even the mime reappears bespeaking wordless optimism while the film speaks to the power--and danger--of packaging democracy like any other product. Mr. Larrain has previously illuminated his nations politics albeit by reflected light--in ""Post Mortem"" which centers on a solitary morgue worker swept up in the U.S.-supported military coup of 1973; and in "" Tony Manero"" which sets its story of a serial killer against the background of Pinochets reign of terror. This time in a film that deals directly with the dictatorship he has taken significant liberties with the No campaign which succeeded by virtue of elaborate grass-roots organization--no mention of that--as well as iconoclastic TV spots. Still ""No"" signals a huge spurt in the filmmakers growth. The appeal of the David-and-Goliath plot is intensified by solid dramatic carpentry and by the fluent back-and-forth between live and archive--in the heat of street battles and mass demonstrations you cant tell if youre watching simulations or the real heart-pounding thing. And the intrinsic wit of the script which Pedro Peirano adapted from a play by Antonio Skarmeta is heightened by deft direction and by Mr. Bernals droll performance. Rene can be as entranced by a microwave oven--another new product his agency is pushing--as he is by taking on a supposedly unbeatable political adversary. Yet hes not the political naif he may have seemed to be before his radicalization (which happens awfully quickly and glibly). The ad man understands all too well that many of the No campaigns disheartened leftists dont share his goal of victory; for them success simply means a chance to air grievances and another honorable loss. Its great fun to see the evolution of the TV spots peddling as they do the proposition that democracy should be fun. First comes the iconic rainbow then a jingle (which shouldnt sound like ""We Are the World"" Rene cautions at the recording session) then singing and dancing manifestations of future jubilance in the body politic. Its all so enjoyable that one risks missing the paradox--that this highly symbolic language as indispensable to the process of marketing politicians as to selling consumer goods is equally the syntax of manipulation and propaganda the sine qua non of those 30-second commercials that have debased political discourse around the world. ""No"" takes note of the paradox in a satirical coda. Rene back at work in the wake of the referendum victory has devised a campaign for a soap opera called ""Beautiful and Bold."" Not only is it framed ""within the actual social context"" as he once again assures his new clients the campaign is built around a bogus event with irresistible appeal for TV news. This time the goal will be Yes by acclamation. Watch a clip from the film ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Russia to help out his son Jack only to discover that he is a CIA operative working to prevent a nuclear-weapons heist. (Photo/Video 20th Century Fox) A Good Day to Die Hard For anyone who remembers the ""Die Hard"" adventures at their vital and exciting best this film feels like a near-death experience. ENLARGE Bruce Willis Twentieth Century Fox Bruce Willis is back as John McClane once an intrepid police detective but now a busybody parody of his younger self. In the travesty that passes for a plot McClane goes to Moscow to find his estranged son Jack ( Jai Courtney) who is actually which is to say absurdly a CIA operative assigned to protect Sebastian Kochs Russian whistleblower who in turn...but all of this is on a need-to-know basis and all you need to know is that the car chases are visual gibberish most of the 97-minute running time is devoted to people shooting at one another the magazines on their assault weapons contain thousands of rounds Mr. Courtneys charms range from undetectable to nil and the movie directed by John Moore plays on the theme of father-and-son reconciliation with the finesse of a primate taught to play ""Chopsticks."" On the other hand the production must have provided significant employment in Budapest whose streets double for Moscows and Skip Woodss thumpingly hollow screenplay brings news that the Chernobyl meltdown wasnt caused by Soviet incompetence as the world has chosen to believe but by some oligarchs scheme to steal plutonium. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is the meltdown of a once-formidable franchise. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Beautiful Creatures."" Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) and Lena (Alice Englert) uncover dark secrets about their respective families their history and their town. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) Beautiful Creatures Early in their relationship Lena and Ethan the anguished lovers of this supernatural romance have a chat about Charles Bukowski. Lena has been reading his books and Ethan asks if Bukowski is any good. ""Define good"" she replies. After a darned good beginning the movie defines bad. ENLARGE Jeremy Irons Warner Bros. Pictures ""Beautiful Creatures"" was directed by Richard LaGravenese from his adaptation of the first in the series of young-adult novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl. The setting is small-town South Carolina where 17-year-old Ethan ( Alden Ehrenreich) dreams of escape but also of an unattainable young beauty who awaits him in a recurring dream on a Civil War battlefield. Lena ( Alice Englert) who strongly resembles that beauty shows up in town to live with her reclusive cousin Macon ( Jeremy Irons oozing doom) and is immediately suspected of being a witch. This suspicion is off the mark but shes still big trouble for Ethan because she is not strictly speaking--or even loosely speaking--human. What a peculiar production this is. Up to a certain point it really does promise to be romantic. Listening to Lena confess that she has troubling powers Ethan is all ears eyes and heart. ""Youre a miracle"" he says ardently. ""Why would you ever want to be normal?"" And the more she tells him of her plight--of The Claiming that will determine at the moment she turns 16 whether her bright or dark side will prevail--the more ardent he becomes. But there is not in fact a lot of feeling between the young actors. And when that certain point comes--when Emma Thompsons arch-conservative Mrs. Lincoln undergoes a sudden change in her character--the movie is claimed just as suddenly by narrative incoherence Tim Burton-envy and the usual demons of digital effects. --J.M. ENLARGE The Loneliest Planet DVD Focus The Loneliest Planet (2011) Gael Garcia Bernal and Hani Furstenberg are Alex and Nica backpacking through the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia prior to getting married in Julia Loktevs spectacularly scenic and tersely dramatic feature. Just as the film compels us to observe Georgias geography it asks us to study its young couples behavior. Until the midpoint theyre as loving and trusting as a couple can be. Then something happens a small but decisive event that transforms the relationship in the blink of an eye and its suddenly clear that the loneliness of the movies title refers not to landscapes but to souls. ENLARGE Unstrung Heroes Buena Vista Pictures/Everett Collection Unstrung Heroes (1995) Richard LaGravenese adapted this beautiful coming-of-age comedy from the splendid memoir of the same name by Franz Lidz. Directed with subtlety and spirit by Diane Keaton the film is little known by now and wasnt much better known when it first came out. Nathan Watt is Steven a 12-year-old with a sick mother (Andie MacDowell) and a remote father ( John Turturro) who runs off to live with his eccentric uncles. Theyre played con gusto and brio by Michael Richards and Maury Chaykin. Phedon Papamichael did the luminous cinematography. Thomas Newman was nominated for an Oscar for his distinctive score. ENLARGE The Lives of Others The Lives of Others (2006) Sebastian Koch is Georg Dreyman the celebrated playwright in Florian Henckel von Donnersmarcks superlative debut feature. The story is set in East Berlin five years before the fall of the Wall when the Stasi or secret police put Dreyman under intense surveillance. The playwright is suspected of nothing in particular but a cultural commissar has his own reasons for targeting him and his actress girlfriend Christa ( Martina Gedeck). In a classic conflict between totalitarianism and art the presiding snoop and up to a point true believer is played by Ulrich Muhe. An Oscar-winner as best foreign film. --J.M.

Frank Masi/20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Frank Masi/20th Century Fox A Good Day To Die Hard Director John Moore Genre Action Running Time 97 minutes Rated R violence and language With Bruce Willis Jai Courtney Sebastian Koch In a dark dusty vault beneath a studio back lot are there stacks and stacks of unproduced Cold War-era screenplays? A pile of untapped bad movie potential like a hidden stockpile of enriched uranium just waiting for a film crew thats looking to make a quick buck with a dirty bomb of a movie? A Good Day to Die Hard the fifth entry in the annals of hard-to-kill New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is not that explosively bad movie. Its the decaying radioactive wreckage left behind after that bomb goes off. It doesnt even feel like it was ever intended to be a Die Hard movie Its like someone went into that Cold War boilerplate pile found a buddy-cop script about two mismatched heroes out to thwart the nefarious plans of some generic Russian bad guys and substituted McClane and his son for the leads. That son Jack (Jai Courtney) is an undercover CIA operative working to bring down a corrupt Russian official; to accomplish that take hes after a file thats supposedly in the possession of whistle-blower Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch). Komarov is being sent to trial on trumped-up charges to keep him quiet; the younger McClane too is up on charges having publicly assassinated another Russian government official in what seems like a particularly boneheaded CIA ploy designed to get him close to Komarov. Back in the U.S. the (increasingly) senior McClane finds out his son is in a Russian prison -- the movies version of the CIA is terrible at keeping secrets it seems -- and hops on an Aeroflot flight overseas to ... well its not entirely clear what hes hoping to accomplish by just wandering into the courthouse unannounced. But never mind all that. Plot is incidental to this franchise nowadays and the needless convolutions of this particular story seem largely like mere ploys to make it seem more interesting than it is. Suffice it to say things start exploding right before the trial and pretty much keep exploding in more and more ludicrous ways right up to the end of the movie. i Willis seems to be enjoying himself in his fifth Die Hard outing but the script lets him down His punch lines feel forced and too many fall flat. Frank Masi/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Frank Masi/Twentieth Century Fox Willis seems to be enjoying himself in his fifth Die Hard outing but the script lets him down His punch lines feel forced and too many fall flat. Frank Masi/Twentieth Century Fox This is the Magpie School of action filmmaking Anytime things start to make so little sense that you might lose the audience just throw something shiny up on screen to distract. Hence lots of slow-motion jumping and falling while fiery explosions billow up in the background. Cars seem to do more flying than driving jumping off of overpasses or over other cars rolling and flipping through the air. In one particularly inspired bit of lunatic misdirection one of the Russian thugs chasing McClane delivers a menacing speech to the hero ... while loudly eating a carrot. I have no recollection of what plot details were conveyed in that speech. But I do remember the carrot -- and Im guessing thats exactly the effect director John Moore was going for. Theres little left of the qualities that made the original Die Hard such a masterpiece -- or even the things that made the substandard sequels marginally watchable. Where before McClane was out to save the life of a family member or a school full of kids here -- after the self-preservation that drives him in the opening sequence -- hes fighting mostly to save his sons reputation and also to thwart a vaguely defined potential terrorist threat. Humor has always been an essential element of McClanes appeal but the attempts here arent even in character. Are we really meant to believe that McClane would answer a cellphone call from his daughter in the midst of a car chase? Or knock out an innocent civilian whos (justifiably) yelling at him for running out into traffic? Even McClanes trademark one-liners are fewer in number generally clunkers and often nearly drowned out by things going boom. Its difficult to tell if the mildly bemused air Willis carries with him through much of the movie is a character choice or just smug satisfaction that hes actually getting away with getting paid for this. A Good Day to Die Hard does have one redeeming aspect It has finally ended the debate over whether Die Hard 2 or 4 is the worst of the series. We finally have a clear loser.

Its been 25 years since McClane scuttled the plans of a band of Euro-baddies in the action hit ""Die Hard."" While its always nice to see Bruce Willis this fifth installment of a franchise that got its start when Ronald Reagan was president -- a point the movie winks at -- is an explosive high-capacity-clip letdown. Presidents have changed but McClane is still having family issues. Grown son Jack (Jai Courtney) has gotten himself into some deep water in Russia having shot a man in a Moscow club. McClane learns his estranged boy is about to stand trial and rushes off to Russia. Turns out the apple didnt roll far from the tree. The kids not a screw-up but a CIA agent working on freeing a government whistleblower and Dads bull-headed timing and desire to connect botches the clandestine operation. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" has plenty of twists one faintly surprising. But for the most part this is a father-son fixer-upper. Dad wasnt around. Sons turned his resentment into a lethal skill set. What better way to right a relationship than with an action-packed accompany-your-kid-to-work adventure? Sebastian Koch gives a soulful heft to Yuri Komarov the whistleblower who plans to bring down Chagarin (Sergey Kolesnikov) his former partner in crime whos angling for political heights. Komarovs only demand is that the CIA also protect his daughter Irina (Yulia Snigir). Shot in Moscow (and Budapest) ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" has a fetching abundance of aerial views of the vast Russian capital. Directed by Irishman John Moore and cobbled together by screenwriter Skip Woods the film looks more stylish than it has a right to. Cinematographer Jonathan Sela has given his grays that foreboding greenish hue. What started out with hints of director Paul Greenglass ""Bourne Ultimatum"" and a touch of Christopher Nolans ""Dark Knight"" gives way to a gussied-up remnant. In a promising early bit McClane gets a ride from a taxi driver (Sha D. Lychnikoff) who proves the universal language of cabbies is chatter. But ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" never achieves a balance between blasts and Willis gift for quips. Marco Beltrami (whos done better) composed a score that is standard-issue action insistent to the point of flat-out pushy. Whats he trying to shove us past? The thin yet hyperactive storytelling? The lack of chemistry between onscreen kin? Hard to tell but the score definitely wants us to feel a sense of urgency. And we should. Chernobyl figures in. So does weapons-grade uranium. The cop-versus-operative street-smart versus spy-craft notion could have been richer but the writer puts Junior at a ridiculous disadvantage. And Courtney all furrowed brow and set mouth doesnt get to have much fun. And this live-action cartoon franchise started out as fun. Although the movie makes minor sport of McClanes age for a supremely better take on the notion of aging rent ""Red"" in which Willis portrays a retired CIA operative. Or better stream "" Looper"" where the star plays a father figure of a sort. Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 lkennedydenverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy ""A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD.""

"Good Day to Die Hard A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; good-day-to-die-hard-a ) Good Day to Die Hard A (United States 2013) February 14 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli One hot summer day in 1988 I emerged from a movie theater exhilarated by what I had just experienced. The film in question was the original Die Hard one of the best thrillers of the decade and one could argue an all-time Top 10 entry for the genre. Over the next quarter-century sequels arrived and with each one the sense of exhilaration diminished. Now with Die Hard 5 a.k.a. A Good Day to Die Hard its pretty much all gone. We have entered generic action movie territory and the idiosyncrasies that made the series special at the outset have been leeched out papered over or turned into obligatory inserts. About the only thing left that inspires a momentary rush is when John McClane utters his inevitable refrain ""Yippee ki-yay motherfucker"" If theres one thing to be said in A Good Day to Die Hards favor its that McClane is more of his wisecracking old self than in the disappointing Live Free or Die Hard. Unfortunately by transplanting the action to Russia (desirable from an international box office perspective) much of the urgency is gone. Worse age has conveyed a degree of invulnerability upon McClane. The guy whose feet were shredded in the Nakatomi Building when he tried to make his way across a floor covered with glass shards is now able to fall through multiple plate glass windows without getting more than a few scratches. In Die Hard McClane needed a tether to jump off a high-rise building. Here no such safety device is needed. I guess the people making A Good Day to Die Hard dont understand that mortality is one of John McClanes most endearing qualities. Turning him into a cyborg with a sense of self-deprecating humor makes this a low point in the series history. Based on the franchises trajectory with each new entry proving to be a little worse than its predecessor I have no desire to see a Die Hard 6. The studio probably agrees with me having relegated A Good Day to Die Hard to a mid-February release. This is as solid a vote of ""no confidence"" as a long-running series can get. Even Live Free or Die Hard was accorded a summer opening. So whats the dumbed-down inane plot? Johns son Jack (Jai Courtney) a CIA operative based in Moscow has been arrested for murder and is awaiting trial. John beset by self-recrimination about not being a good enough parent takes a vacation to Moscow. (What he expects to do when he gets there isnt revealed. Speaking no Russian and without any allies does he plan to engineer a jailbreak?) Before he can reach the courthouse where Jack is about to face Russian justice all hell breaks loose. In the ensuing chaos Jack is able to break free. In tow is a political dissident Komarov (Sebastian Koch) who has knowledge of ""damaging"" discs that implicate important people in nefarious past activities. Jack encounters John in a street near the courthouse and thus begins an uneasy 90 minutes of father/son bonding as the McClanes join forces to bring down the bad guys whose ultimate goal seems to be gaining possession of tons of weapons grade Uranium. Standard action movie save the world stuff. Strangely A Good Day to Die Hard doesnt have a real villain. Looking back at the original Die Hard it was as much about Alan Rickmans incredible Hans Gruber as it was about Bruce Willis John McClane. Since then the Die Hard villains have been lacking but this is easily the worst case of bungling the bad guy - too many henchman and no real boss. When the top villain is unmasked the revelation is anything but surprising. With no single focus for McClanes righteous fury this ends up being a story in which he hoists a big gun and mows down minions. Yippee ki-yay indeed. With Bruce Willis approaching 60 (hell turn 58 this year - still a babe in the woods compared to Stallone and Schwarzenegger) it was decided to give John a sidekick. This isnt the first Die Hard to attempt that but in the previous two it was still primarily McClane on his own with occasional buddy movie overtones. The partner (Samuel L. Jackson in Die Hard with a Vengeance and Justin Long in Live Free or Die Hard) was clearly positioned as a second fiddle. In A Good Day to Die Hard it feels reversed with Jack being the central figure and John acting as his support. This simply doesnt work. For better or for worse those who see A Good Day to Die Hard are there because theyre willing to suspend disbelief that an old guy can do all these things. Theyre not there to see John McClane backing up his younger buff son. The movie tries to inject a little drama into the John/Jack dynamic. It fails utterly. Worse the three minute scene in which the characters drama reaches its climax brings the films momentum to a screeching halt. The nature of the McClane familys dysfunction which has already been played out in the earlier films (didnt we see essentially the same thing with Lucy in the fourth installment?) isnt interesting or compelling. Director John Moore proves to be a competent action director. The chases fights shootouts and explosions are adequately handled although lacking in energy and inventiveness. They get the job done. Its just that none of this feels right for a Die Hard movie. Its what one might expect from a second-rate throwaway action thriller that no one cares much about. And maybe thats what this series has become. The Die Hards probably should have ended after the original trilogy. Bringing them back after all these years smacks of desperation of a franchise clinging by its fingertips to the brink of relevancy. With A Good Day to Die Hard that grip has slipped. Bruce Willis will continue. Action/thrillers will continue. But the time has come to write Die Hards obituary.

Comments click to enlarge A Good Day to Die Hard Video Rated R  97 minutes  2013 Bruce Willis returns yet again as world-weary every-cop John McClane this time reconnecting with his estranged son (Jai Courtney) and taking on a terrorist network in Russia. Unnecessary but not unwatchable this maintains a brisk pace as it moves through the familiar action set pieces most of them decently orchestrated; it also avoids both the leaden self-seriousness of Sylvester Stallones Rambo and Rocky reboots and the self-congratulating would-be camp of his Expendables movies. The father-son relationship is unconvincing though partly because Courtney is so lifeless (he seems to have been cast so as not to upstage Willis) and partly because the filmmakers dont give a damn about characterization anyway.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Bruce Willis stars as John McClane and Jai Courtney stars as Jack McClane in ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" Story highlightsBruce Willis is back for the latest installment in the ""Die Hard"" franchiseThe film finds his character traveling to Moscow to find his sonCritic says it may be time to call it a dayNot your typical Valentines Day release ""Die Hard""s fifth is Hollywoods counterpunch to chocolates roses and romance. Its an anti-date movie. Well unless your date is also your dad.Bruce Willis has been playing John McClane off and on for a quarter century now and while he shows no inclination of throwing in the towel its hard to see much future for the geriatric action film he and his former Planet Hollywood cronies are peddling these days with ""The Expendables."" ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a more lavish demolition derby than ""Bullet to the Head"" or ""The Last Stand"" but its also more slavish in its adherence to a formula thats all but spent. No ones heart seems to be in it theyre just going through the motions.Why Die Hard is the perfect Valentines Day movie for guysA New York cop who scarcely seems to spend any time in the Big Apple McClane heads out to Moscow to bail out a deadbeat son Jack who I dont recall featuring in the earlier movies. Jai Courtney from ""Jack Reacher"" and ""Spartacus Blood and Sand"" is what they call ""fresh meat"" and a more conventional action hero than Justin Long was in McClanes last escapade. But on this evidence McClane junior hasnt inherited any of his fathers charisma or wry wit. Mostly he just looks put out understandable as screenwriter Skip Woods makes sure senior always has the last word. Not that any of Willis wisecracks are anything to write home about. That trademark smirk is stretched pretty thin.Its only after Jack has bust out of his trial dragging a political prisoner with him (Sebastian Koch) that John finds out his boy is with the CIA. By then the extraction is blown and father and son have a rogue militia wing tearing up the streets gunning for them.This is male bonding with a capital ""B"" but comparisons with the reinvigorated 007 series only show how far behind ""Die Hard"" has fallen. A lengthy chase on the Moscow ring road throws entire fleets of Russian commuters under the proverbial bus but still feels like an inferior copy of a similar sequence in ""Skyfall"" while director John Moore (""Max Payne"") defaults to the ADD editing style thats only good for disguising how thinly-imagined this show really is. Even a climactic showdown in Chernobyl a potentially fascinating location for any movie proves a damp squib. Moore gives us an abandoned industrial plant at night and any radiation barely even registers as a factor (the McClanes dont need hazmat suits; theyre indestructible).If theres something crassly opportunistic about exploiting a real life disaster on the scale of Chernobyl for cheap thrills thats part and parcel of the films cynicism. Theres always been an undercurrent of xenophobia in the ""Die Hard"" series but this movies crude insistence on a corrupt morally bankrupt Russia betrays simple-minded nostalgia for those Cold War days when the Berlin Wall demarcated good and evil.Do I ask too much from an action film? If so its only because I havent forgotten how good the first ""Die Hard"" was (and still is). The producers keep throwing more money at the franchise but in this case more is less. Less attention to character coherence and suspense the very qualities that made ""Die Hard"" stand out in the first place.""A Good Day to Die Hard""? A good time to call it a day.

Its true that we live in an age of cynicism but I say people generally treat each right and civilization keeps humming along based on our mutual trust and affection. This worldview leads me to believe ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" was created almost entirely by robots. There is simply no chance an editor director or studio head previewed the final product and decided to release it into theaters. Any human who watched ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" could have only said ""My God what have I done?"" and scuttled the project forevermore. No its clear that ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" was an early and crude attempt to see if artificial intelligence has improved enough to allow for a full-on CG edit. I dont mean special effects were not talking about CGI here no I mean the entire film after it was shot was completely computer generated. The whole idea was likely a DARPA experiment and one day well likely have robot nurses and companions that are the result of these early forays into sentient robot creation. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" was an early sacrifice on the pillar of knowledge because theres no chance they expected this movie to be received with anything other than disdain. My only slight concern is that they decided to ruin the ""Die Hard"" franchise as a result. Couldnt this have been done with a throwaway rom-com instead? 97 percent of ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is set in Russia. The only other location is the airport where John McClane (Bruce Willis) is being dropped off by his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Hes on his way to Moscow to check in on his son Jack McClane (Jai Courtney) and the criminally underused Winstead drives him to the airport to see him off. At this point weve been treated to a few scenes in Mother Russia that deal with some sort of coup or blackmail situation - really its nearly impossible to tell because weve never met any of these characters. Nor are we made to care in the least about Russian politics the C.I.A.s involvement or Johns son. The film barely makes it 85 seconds before its already in deep trouble. Jack McClane seems to have gotten himself into an international incident and poppa John steps in to make things much worse. This is entirely within the ""Die Hard"" franchise tradition and so cant be dinged other than to say it feels forced. Were treated to a 15-minute car chase right from the get-go (remember thats one-sixth of the film) and to say this chase is idiotic is probably to give it too much emotional weight. Hating something requires real care and concern whereas this plays out like a crow chasing an owl 1000 yards away from you. You think ""Huh"" and then go back to your morning jog or truffle harvest. It has no impact whatsoever other than ""loud noises."" Then were in for some twists Unfortunately this comes with a sort of logical chestnut as in do you care about plot devices if the story doesnt make any sense and isnt at all interesting? The answer is a resounding ""no"". ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is impossible to care about unless youre noting with malice how often John McClane exclaims ""Im on vacation"" (the answer for the record is four). Of course the most galling thing about this painfully recycled punchline is that hes not even on vacation - hes there to find his son. This is the very definition of a working weekend. He has a goal in mind and no plans to sip martinis so clearly the robots have reared their ugly synthetic heads again theyve noted how action films sometimes have moments of levity interspersed into perilous scenes and figured theyd just repeat the same line over and over. Typical rookie robot mistake As the film progresses there are more irrelevant action scenes and preposterous set-ups. The whole thing takes place in front of plate glass windows that are perched above swimming pools or other soft landings so that Jack and John have some place to fall on or shoot through. Its the composite of an action film with no soul or life force to guide it. Almost unfathomably ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" decides to focus on the repairing of a father-son relationship only the son was last seen in 1998 when he was just a boy. Really horrific homages to the previously great franchise are attempted in a farcical effort to get you to pass off this film as ""not that bad"" based on your memories of the legitimate action films that came before it. The entire enterprise is a bewildering mess put in place only to frustrate and alienate anyone who buys a ticket. Every action scene is telegraphed and most of the dialogue is irrevocably stupid. You neednt give up your hard-earned money to see this catastrophe of cinematic experimentation; youd be better off mowing your lawn or watching the original ""Die Hard"" with friends instead. This version is a pit of despair ""Taken 2"" meets an infectious disease a shining example of what happens when you choose not to bother with quality and turn your product over to beings without a functioning consciousness. Grade D- Laremy wrote the book on  film criticism and pretty much enjoyed the other ""Die Hard"" films.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Ah jeez. I actually wanted this one to be good. Or at least decent. Or at least a reminder of what got us all fired up about the first Die Hard in 1988. But A Good Day To Die Hard the fifth in a creatively exhausted series is total crap. Bruce Willis is back as the NYPDs John McClane. But now hes in Russia to free his son Jack (Jai Courtney) from the clutches of baddies. Call it Die Hard Does Taken. Of course Sonny Boy (nicely played by Courtney) is a good guy. But why give away the plot when theres precious little of it. The script by Skip Woods (Swordfish) is incoherent. The direction by John Moore (Max Payne) is a jumble. The digitally amplified clatter of guns choppers fireballs and crashing cars never stops but its impossible to know where you are at any given time or why you should give a damn. The Willis smirk is always a welcome sight. But his one-liners are cringe-inducing especially when he ties to show his love. ""Lets go kill some motherfuckers"" is as close as McClane comes to bonding. This series needs to die here. That would be something to ""Yippee Ki-Yay"" about.

Willis is the baby of the trio at 57 and its reasonable to expect that the bewildering and idiotic ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" the latest installment of a franchise that has yet to fail at the box office will prosper where ""The Last Stand"" and ""Bullet to the Head"" have bombed. Its also the worst of the three films by far at least if youre sticking somewhere in the vicinity of old-fashioned ideas about the coherence of plot characterization and setting but I recognize thats irrelevant. (For the record Stallones ""Bullet to the Head"" while totally cartoonish is more fun and better made than the other two.)""Die Harderer"" or ""Die Hella Hard"" or ""Faster Pussycat Die Hard"" or whatever its called features a killer motor-vehicle chase on the congested highways of Moscow and a dude getting chopped into pulp by helicopter blades. At Chernobyl. Oh and a fair number of close-ups of Willis positioning his jaw just so and delivering that smirk the one that comes with quotation marks or a trademark symbol. What else do you actually need to know? Its not like theres some shark that can be jumped in a ""Die Hard"" movie some frontier of crassness or mendacity or assholishness that has not previously been crossed. Theres no point in acting all outraged about the fact that the fourth sequel to a 1988 action hit is pretty much three well-staged action sequences strung together with the dumbest imaginable connective tissue.Still I cant help observing that the aggressive stupidity of this movie is impressive. Its not just that its an ugly fantasy of masculine dominance aimed at 11-year-old boys - or more precisely at adult men who wish to cling to the 11-year-old joy with which they first encountered this kind of movie - its also a fantasy that rests on the idea that youre better off not knowing anything about the outside world because theres nothing to know. Willis character John McClane who is still supposedly a New York cop goes to Russia in search of his bad-seed son Jack (the impressively muscled Jai Courtney of TVs ""Spartacus War of the Damned"") who turns out to be a CIA agent who is trying to spirit some evil rich dude out of the clutches of some Moscow government minister dude who is even more evil. We can tell that about the second dude because every time we see him hes walking at normal speed and talking in Russian on his phone and then whoosh he slows into super slo-mo with ominous music playing. Evil You Might Also Like But Jack is a really terrible CIA agent because he has no idea that everybody in Russia is double-crossing everybody else in a dastardly scheme that makes no sense at all but results in a high-speed wrong-way highway chase the total destruction of a Moscow luxury hotel - whos going to pay for all that Mr. Big Evil Gangster? You and your slow-motion-walking Kalashnikov-sporting friends? - and the aforementioned helicopter battle amid the Chernobyl glow-zone (actually shot using a loaner chopper from the Belarus military which is kind of sad). Heres Jacks explanation to John of all the bad things the bad guy will do ""Im talking terrorism WMDs nukes - all that stuff."" Well maybe he wanted to spare his dad all the nuances of the CIA briefing room since theres a sparkling gag about how John doesnt know the difference between Chernobyl and Grenoble (which has cute girls in ski outfits and is in the French Alps). Then again it takes a dose of Johns tough love and Noo Yawk street smarts to convince Jack that the only way to deal with these perfidious Russkies is to kill em all and let the nonexistent Commie God sort em out later. I take it theyre not expecting big box office in the former Soviet Union for this picture. (The Chinese may dig it though.) The only female characters in this movie are alternately bitchy or mousy bit parts and for that matter theres almost no dialogue in Skip Woods screenplay and what there is of it shouldve been cut out. Theres a scene when Jack and John finally confess their love for each other that would have seemed too embarrassing for a 1998 beer commercial.As for Irish-born director John Moore he of ""Max Payne"" and ""Flight of the Phoenix"" and the 2006 remake of ""The Omen"" he stages all the scenes in which Willis stunt double has to jump through a window with aplomb and that happens about six times. Someone has to direct this kind of grade-C bargain-basement Hungarian-shot sequel if only to raise enough cash to send Willis back to his third-act career doing mildly self-mocking roles in smaller movies. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" ends with the recent and somewhat non-terrible Rolling Stones single ""Doom amp; Gloom"" which is a reasonable point of comparison. Like Mick and Keith Willis plans to keep on delivering his limited shtick until he drops dead or the world comes to an end and we all know which of those things is likely to come first.

Maybe its that shaved pate of his a bullet-head that still looks primed for any chamber. Anyway his look alone is sufficient to prompt this memo from the Department of Faint Praise A quarter-century after it began A Good Day to Die Hard continues the franchise without undue embarrassment. Screen grab from an online trailer for the film ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" Movies A Good Day to Die Hard The official trailer Once again its a family affair. At the airport a grizzled John McClane bids his daughter a fond farewell before jetting off to Russia in search of his estranged son. That daughter you might recall was jeopardized in an earlier chapter so she should know better than to offer this advice to her dear departing dad ""Just try not to make an even bigger mess of things."" Such heresy. Making a bigger mess of things is to action franchises what up is to ante. Everybody knows that not least director John Moore who wastes little time making the messy point.But first a cute interlude on the streets of Moscow when as a crazy Russian cabbie warbles NewYork New York off-key in a thick accent John looks out at the snarled Garden Ring and mutters those four words that echo through every corner of our global village ""Traffic sucks here too."" Of course its about to get worse when the baddies detonate an entire city block just prior to a chase sequence that complete with the usual battery of cars/vans/armoured trucks/rocket-propelled grenades screeches and roars and rolls and explodes for 10 consecutive minutes. Cant say its thrilling but it is hugely messy which in the lexicon of directors like Moore amounts to the same thing.Somewhere in those 10 minutes John comes face to face with his boy Jack (Jai Courtney) who aint happy to see him. Turns out the lad is a CIA operative on a mission to encourage a corrupt Russian named Komarov to blow the whistle on an even more corrupt Russian named Chagarin. Not that the plot matters much. Really this is just a bonding exercise between badass daddy and by-the-book son. Naturally after much bickering battering bloodying and mutual declarations to ""kill all the scumbags"" bond they assuredly do. Indeed listen closely amid the Dolbyesque din of massive attack helicopters and not-so-safe houses blown-up-real-good and you just might hear a tender ""I love you boy."" Touching.En route John labours hard to re-establish his brand as a super anti-hero unblessed with super powers unless you count the ability to crash repeatedly through plate-glass windows and tumble down the whole length of very tall buildings without sustaining anything more distressing than a manly scratch on that shaved pate. Its a knack that stands him in good stead during the climactic visit to Chernobyl which looks as post-apocalyptic as you might expect but surprising to me at least contains within a basement recess a treasure trove of enriched uranium.But not to worry. The baddies unlike certain action-movie directors arent intent on blowing up the world. Instead as John McClane/Bruce Willis rightly intuits ""Its all about the money. Whens it not about the money?"" And John McClane/Bruce Willis the bullet-head of yet another franchise that refuses to die hard knows of what he speaks.

At the airport McClanes daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) sees him off. She must know that her father is Bruce Freakin Willis who has foiled many an evil genius in the 25 years since the first Die Hard movie. Hell she was in the fourth one just six years ago. Yet Lucy pleads ""Just try try not to make a bigger mess of things."" The bullet-headed McClane is too much the gentleman to reply ""Its called saving the world honey."" With Live Free or Die Hard -- the fourth in the series after the original (1988) Die Hard 2 (1990) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) -- Willis and director Len Wiseman defibrillated the franchise with an old-fashioned action movie that boasted some spectacular car stunts and a passable camaraderie between McClane and a computer hacker played by Justin Long. The movies antique zazz stoked vagrant hopes that Willis who turns 58 next month could keep matching his grizzled retro cop to the noble craft of man-made rather than digital filmmaking. (READ Corlisss review of Live Free or Die Hard) A Good Day to Die Hard directed by John Moore (Max Payne) and written by reboot hackmeister Skip Woods (X-Men Origins Wolverine; The A-Team) douses all optimism with that early moment at the airport and any other scene in which the performers have to speak or impersonate human beings. Its the lamest and most vacant of the quintet -- though if you mistakenly think youre buying a ticket to a demolition derby instead of a night at the movies youll feel right at home. Taking McClanes nickname (""the 007 of Plainfield New Jersey"") much too seriously Woods plants his hero in creepy-exotic locales -- Moscow and the Chernobyl nuclear plant -- to crack an international terrorist plot that could have come from an 80s James Bond film gone wildly commie-phobic. The new Die Hard paints a post-Soviet Russia in which the glasnost is shattered everythings grim and gray and an over-muscled tough sports a large CCCP (USSR) tattoo on his upper back. Everyones corrupt and nothing works. The national anthem ought to be ""Putin on the Fritz."" Not that it matters but heres the plot. Back in Soviet Union days two venal biggies Komarov (Sebastian Koch star of the German Oscar-winning spy film The Lives of Others) and Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov) hatched a plot to make themselves billionaires and the world way less safe. Komarov became a public dissident; Chagarin now Defense Minister wants to settle scores before he kills his old partner. Jack an undercover agent for the CIA hopes to keep Komarov alive and spirit him out of the country. To balance the McClane father and son the movie gives Komarov a daughter Irina (Yuliya Snigir) who also has a familiarity with firearms and a ballet-loving henchman named Alik (Radivoje Bukvic). Everyone shoots at everyone else though somehow the Russian super-marksmen keep missing. Probably has to do with American know-how. (READ Corliss on Bruce Willis Zen machismo) Absent the inspiration of Live Frees great stunts A Good Day makes up for what it lacks in quality in the quantity of things that go CRASH and BOOM Instead of an ""Ive never seen that before"" feeling your reaction to the explosions and car crashes is likely to be ""Ive never seen so much of that before."" The two McClanes endure endless minutes of deafening fire from an Mi-26 Halo helicopter and no one nearby not even any of the cops on the ground takes notice. A chase around Moscows downtown Garden Ring -- involving the elder McClane in a Unimog his son in a Sprinter van and the bad guys in a heavily armored MRAP with a ZIL truck chassis and a 500-hp Dodge Ram engine -- may break even action-movie records for collateral damage. At one point McClane crashes off an overpass and navigates over the hoods of a dozen or so trucks and cars to reach the highway below. After flattening one car he lands on McClane mutters ""Sorry maam"" and speeds on. Its both borderline sociopathic and kinda cool. How can a standard-issue Manhattan liberal like me -- who has never owned a car and who thinks guns should be made of licorice -- take pleasure in this well-staged mayhem? Partly by default since the rest of the movie stinks. The tough-guy banter lack the requisite snap or wit. The interludes in which the two McClanes try groping toward father-son rapprochement are embarrassing to actors and viewers alike. Courtney a young Australian seems as removed from Willis acting space as Jack has been from his father. Even the veteran star looks disengaged from the project as if he were fulfilling a contractual obligation. Isnt this his franchise? (READ Joel Steins 2007 profile of Bruce Willis) At this strange crossroads in film history the work of action choreographers and visual-effects wizards has far outstripped the talents of most writers and directors. A movie like A Good Day to Die Hard ought to either hire someone who can write catchy dialogue and at least superficially plausible characters or just let the real artists the stuntmen run the whole picture. No Humans Allowed. And yet Theres a moment when after the 800th explosion Jack groans in pain a screw sticking in his stomach. Papa McClane pulls it out and the two continue their quest. Like the Tin Woodman in The Wizard of Oz Jack could be just a mechanical man a cyborg in need of a tune-up. No Humans Needed either.

Bruce Willis returns to his seminal role as New York flatfoot under siege John McClane. The locale is Moscow; the mission at first is for Papa John to reconnect with estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) whos gotten mixed up in some shady underworld doings. But it turns out McClane Jr. is actually a CIA operative whos tasked with getting Anonymous Hirsute Baddie (Sebastian Koch) to a secret underground vault in Chernobyl and now Daddys along for the ride. And were a long way from this shoot-em-up franchises John McTiernan-helmed heyday. Willis gives one of his laziest-ever performances leadenly tossing off each quip (""Im on vacation"" is the most abused) and acting like hes passing a kidney stone during the bathetic father-son bonding scenes. Hes ill-matched with both Courtney (little more than a lumbering set of muscles) and Koch--entirely lacking the oily charisma of the seriess best villain Alan Rickmans Hans Gruber whom the film shamelessly references via one head-slapping visual reprise. And speaking of images director John Moore (Max Payne) stages the copious action sequences with an inelegance and ineptitude that is truly staggering all eardrum-shattering sound effects and headache-inducing zooms that would give the Duplass brothers pause.

"A Good Day to Die Hard (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review A Good Day to Die Hard (R) More like a good reason to stay home. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com2/14/2013 Editor rating 1 Early on in A Good Day to Die Hard comes a prolonged car/truck chase through the clogged streets of Moscow that contains some of the most impressive stunt driving Ive ever seen in a movie. As far as I could tell director John Moore (Max Payne The Omen) used little to no CGI in the entire sequence. Those are real 18-wheelers and tankers and dump trucks smashing into each other and the tactile feel of the scene which goes on for at least 15 minutes gets the movie off to a super-fun start. Its an orgy of Hollywood bombast and destruction at its most wanton. Theres just one problem With the exception of Bruce Willis reprising his signature role of NYPD officer John McClane you dont know who any of the people in the vehicles are why theyre chasing each other or whats so important that its worth pulverizing half of Moscow. With the exception of McClanes son Jack (Jai Courtney) a CIA agent who has inherited all of his fathers crimefighting smarts every character in the movie is a double-crossing Russian performed by actors who seem to be impersonating Boris and Natasha from The Rocky amp; Bullwinkle Show. There are MacGuffins and double-MacGuffins trips to Chernobyl during which the actors take off their radiation suits so you can see their faces to tell them apart and everyone carries magical guns that never run out of bullets. Director Moore has the visual chops for this sort of material -- theres a beautiful shot done in slow-motion of two men falling to the ground alongside a mortally damaged helicopter -- but he seems to think of people primarily as things you shoot at or blow up. The incoherent script by Skip Woods (Swordfish Hitman The A-Team) doesnt help. How does this guy keep getting work? Whose daughter did he marry? The heart of A Good Day to Die Hard  is supposed to be Johns relationship with his estranged son Jack who resents him for always having put his work before family. But whenever the movie pauses to let the characters work out their differences you start hoping someone will throw a grenade into the room. Willis can be a terrific actor when hes engaged by the material (Looper) but hes so bored and distant here even his trademark smirk comes off as condescending. In the original Die Hard McClane was constantly scrambling and using his brain to ferret his way out of impossible situations. In A Good Day to Die Hard Willis cant be bothered to look even slightly worried when surrounded by chatty bad guys who love to make long speeches before pulling the trigger (man those Russian villains really love to grandstand). Unlike Live Free or Die Hard which took heat for its wussy PG-13 rating A Good Day to Die Hard returns the series to its R-rated roots primarily so Willis can spout his famed ""Yippee-ki-yay"" line in its vulgar entirety. Is anyone supposed to still be excited by this? This is the first Die Hard movie to run well under two hours (the incomprehensible final 30 minutes have been so furiously chopped they deserve their own show on the Food Network). This is also the first Die Hard not to be released during the blockbuster summer season. Instead the picture arrives in icy lonely February instead following recent winter flops by Willis fellow 80s action icons Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Time to give the shoot-em-up thing a rest guys Its tired and played out and so are you. Cast Bruce Willis Jai Courtney Sebastian Koch Yuliya Sniger. Director John Moore. Screenwriter Skip Woods.

But the latest ""Die Hard"" - titled a little clumsily ""A Good Die to Die Hard"" -- makes ""Die Hard 2 Die Harder"" look sophisticated. And John McTiernans original ""Die Hard"" and ""Die Hard With a Vengeance""? Practically Altmanesque. The new film in the franchise -- the fifth after the 2007 cyber-warfare one ""Live Free or Die Hard"" -- has old cop John McClane (who must be putting in his 40th year on the force by now) heading to Russia to help out his son whos in jail. Why? Well never mind. But soon after McClane arrives and blunders into some sort of courtroom siege (and of course immediately butts in by punching out civilians and stealing cars) it seems were in the midst of a high-stakes national power grab. Of course as in any ""Die Hard"" film you can be sure of two things First nothing is ever quite what it seems. And second until the real criminals and their final intent becomes clear McClane is going to jump through as many big plate-glass windows as possible. Its all absurd of course but a relatively competent director like McTiernan was able to hold it together. In fact his two installments -- with villains like Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons and plots that actually required some puzzling out -- are guiltless entertainments. But John Moore is not a relatively competent director. He is instead the hack who gave us Mark Wahlbergs aptly titled ""Max Payne."" Also those who-asked remakes of ""The Omen"" and ""The Flight of the Phoenix."" And that truly improbable military actioner ""Behind Enemy Lines."" So what on earth made the studio entrust him with this valuable franchise? (And ever since they cheated themselves out of the real ""Star Wars"" money Fox has been a studio that loves its franchises.) Thats a plot even John McClane couldnt get to the bottom of. Bruce Willis is of course McClane again and hes in pure aging-movie-star mode coasting on charisma and crows-feet and cashing a very nice check. So nice a check that there doesnt seem to have been enough left to hire any actors who might actually challenge him. Irons? Rickman? Boy you miss villains like that. At one point there was talk that Patrick Stewart might have been cast -- but no theres no one as remotely colorful among the bad guys And McClanes son played by the pudding-faced Jai Courtney is just a lug. So what does Moore do? Well he pours on the excess with endless scenes of car crashes fireballs and dozens of nameless assassins killing and being killed. At one point a heavily muscled thug appears CCCP tattooed across his rippling shoulders and you hope for an old-fashioned fight scene. like when that grinning chrome-domed Nazi popped up on the airport tarmac to give Indiana Jones a tough time. But no. He just pulls out a big gun and McClane and McClane Jr. pull out big guns and everybody starts firing. True Willis remains a flinty presence -- albeit one in search of some tinder -- and although some of the plot twists never do make sense the last half hour barrels along nicely. But at this point ""Die Hard"" no longer describes the franchise. It describes the fans who are still willing to turn out for the noise and nonsense. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. A Good Day to Die Hard (R) Fox (97 min.) Directed by John Moore. With Bruce Willis Jai Courtney.

Feb. 14 2013A Good Day to Die HardStarring Bruce Willis Jai Courtney and Sebastian Koch. Directed by John Moore. 97 minutes. Opens Feb. 14 at major theatres. 14AValentines Day may not seem like the most opportune moment to release the latest Die Hard yippee-ki-yay. Shouldnt Cupids time be about cuddles and kisses rather than bullets and bravado?Praise the love and pass the ammunition there is wisdom behind this franchise folly and a reason to see Bruce Willis and his tattered white T-shirt save the world yet again.Article Continued BelowThe Die Hard series sells the lone wolf concept -- Willis vs. global terrorists -- yet deep down its really about family reunification. Good thing too because the violence gets old fast.The thump-thump-thump of the heart may be hard to discern behind the rat-tat-tat of machine gun fire but the love has always been there. Die Hards 1-3 sought to return cowboy cop John McClane to the shaky embrace of his wife (Bonnie Bedelia); the fourth film Live Free or Die Hard had McClane rescuing his adult daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).Now comes chapter five A Good Day to Die Hard. It moves the divorced and retired McClane to Moscow while reuniting him with his son Jack (Jai Courtney of TVs Spartacus Blood and Sand). Jack was barely glimpsed as a child in 1988s original Die Hard played by Noah Land and hasnt been seen since.The years havent been kind to father-son relations. Estranged from papa Jack has nevertheless followed in his old mans footsteps doing beat-downs on bad guys although hes more sleuth than cop. Hes also in a heap of trouble which includes trying to protect Russian whistleblower Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) from the lethal vengeance of corrupt politician Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov).Much to Jacks chagrin John shows up uninvited in Russia and the mayhem really begins. John is barely off the plane before hes stealing cars driving insanely and causing more damage to Moscow than the Blues Brothers did to Chicago.Hes also vainly trying to reconnect with a son whom he now regrets ignoring for most of the past 25 years when he was pounding the NYPD beat while also saving the planet. Jack isnt buying the contrition; he coldly addresses his father as simply ""John.""Heres where A Good Day to Die Hard finds its heartbeat rather than just a quickened pulse. Waiting to hear whether Jack will once again call John ""Dad"" inspires more rooting interest than counting the bodies and bent metal piled high by director John Moore (Max Payne) and screenwriter Skip Woods (The A-Team).The story gets increasingly messy involving a hidden file of incriminating information (the movies MacGuffin) a sexy woman (Yuliya Snigir) and a trip to nuke-ravaged Chernobyl Hollywoods radioactively hot new trouble destination. (No its not ski haven Grenoble as Jack impatiently tells John.)The visuals alas are a blur of flying bullets squealing wheels and shattered glass. Moore goes in big for the shaky cam ADD editing and lens flare that weakly substitute for action in todays movies. Fortunately it hardly matters because the personal dynamics are what really count.Willis and Courtney make a strong match believable both as fractious family members and also as sarcastic adversaries forced by circumstances to work together. Theyre also funny. They humorously bond while one pulls a pesky bullet out of the other and also while cocking their guns in an elevator to the Muzak strains of ""The Girl from Ipanema"" (although Sly and the Family Stones ""A Family Affair"" would have been funnier).Theres also a potential for a drinking game one shot for every time Willis angrily yells ""Im on vacation"" You can actually imagine these guys working together for a sixth Die Hard which doesnt seem like such a terrible idea especially if Mary Elizabeth Winstead returns for more than the cameo she has here. The family that yippee-ki-yays together stays together.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsPrince William and Kate coming back to Canada this fallRoyals are scheduled to come to British Columbia and the Yukon but no word on whether they will bring their children.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Yippee ki-yawn. By Ann HornadayThursday February 14 2013Armed and ludicrous John McClane is back in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" the fifth installment of the beloved franchise starring Bruce Willis. As the New York cop who never met a problem he couldnt shoot or drive out of Willis brings his characteristic deadpan cool to a role he originated in the 1980s a long-past era that the movie addresses head-on when a villain reminds McClane that ""its not 1986 . . . and Reagan is dead."" That self-referential aside may inspire viewers to question what if anything the ""Die Hard"" franchise means 25 years after its inception when jingoism and gunplay arent the automatic crowd-pleasers they once were. As the ultimate ugly American McClane is now cutting his destructive swath through Moscow where theres seemingly always a gun or a bomb at the ready and where he casually hijacks a sport-utility vehicle while cursing its driver for getting in his way. ""Im on vacation"" is one of McClanes tag lines in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" -- except well he isnt. Hes come to Mother Russia in order to find out whats happened to his son Jack (Jai Courtney) a chip off the sullen aggressive block whos managed to land in a Moscow prison. Supposedly a study in father-son psychodrama ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" delves into John and Jacks relationship just enough to provide support for the action its a delivery system for -- much like the layers of scaffolding the two fall through in one of the films repetitive frantically filmed set pieces. Brought to the screen by John Moore ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is staged and choreographed as if by a bored toddler its jittery car chases hyperkinetic explosions and ham-handed gunfights piling up with wanton randomness until they culminate in a you-got-your-peanut-butter-in-my-chocolate stunt involving a whirling helicopter a dangling truck and a gruesomely absurd bit of business with a propeller. None of it makes any sense even within the no-rules world of Skip Woodss rushed incoherent script (which makes 2007s ""Live Free or Die Hard"" look like a Golden Age masterpiece by comparison). From the outset when McClane arrives in Moscow and takes a cab ride that literally goes nowhere -- literally -- ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" makes it clear that its prime purpose isnt crisp storytelling or even modest character development but simply generating its approved quota of testosterone-drenched wammies in less than two hours. This mission the film carries out efficiently with a bracingly brief running time and a lack of self-seriousness that makes ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" slightly more enjoyable than recent offerings from Williss contemporaries Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. If McClanes sarcastic one-liners and New Jersey jokes never quite stick their landings Willis himself still goes through the films cartoonish motions with his signature grim aplomb delivering his profane catchphrase almost as an afterthought. Both assaultive and tiresome ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" barely registers on the action movie Richter scale. It goes bang it goes boom and then it blessedly goes away. Contains violence and language.

The title is oddly gnomic but everything else about A Good Day to Die Hard is as workmanlike as men in fluorescent tabards repainting the white lines on the North Circular on a wet Tuesday. Try some keywords for size Russian bad guys American heroes Chernobyl weapons-grade uranium double-crossing guns helicopters explosions... Lots of explosions. Lots and lots of explosions. And a car chase through the streets of Moscow that leaves a trail of debris behind it that will keep Russian scrapdealers in business for years to come. It might sound like were back in the world of 1980s action movies but the story is contemporary. Retired detective John McClane (Willis) heads to the Russian capital after his son Jack (Jai Courtney) gets in a spot of bother. It turns out Jacks on the side of the angels (well the CIA) and he and papa become embroiled in an attempt to defend a nuclear scientist (Sebastian Koch) from some cookie-cutter villains (one of whom does a sinister tap dance) who want to get hold of a file in his possession. This meathead-and-potatoes plot is accompanied by a drip-drip thaw in father-son relations. Apart from the odd weak one-liner (Theres a two-year contract on that phone says Willis when someone smashes his mobile) the whole thing is played as straight as a die. There are no knowing winks to Williss age as you might expect which is probably sensible as he does a reasonable job and still manages - just - to hold his own as an action star even if hes trading on past glories and doesnt appear to do much heavy lifting himself. Its everything going on around him thats so laughable and its especially hard to imagine his charm-lite new sidekick Courtney taking his place in the series... if that is the plan. The whole thing is a tedious trashy throwback.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The original Die Hard was never comfortable sequel material. Bruce Willis protagonist John McClane was just an off-duty cop who stumbled onto a large-scale criminal operation and had to improvise his way around it. ""How can the same shit happen to the same guy twice?"" Willis wondered in the sequel. By now he doesnt ask himself such questions. The blue-collar vulnerable McClane of Die Hard wouldnt even recognize the bulletproof catchphrase-spouting superhero hes become in the sequels. Similarly the movies have changed dramatically from the 80s-style stunts and explosions of the first one to the digitally enhanced action-fantasy of the most recent entries. Until now the sequels have gotten away with the cynical franchising of John McClane but A Good Day To Die Hard the worst entry in the series by far exposes the hollowness and stupidity of McClane 2.0. After rescuing his estranged daughter in the last film Live Free Or Die Hard Willis heads to Russia to rescue his estranged son (Jai Courtney) a CIA agent on a mission to protect a whistleblower (Sebastian Koch) from a corrupt government official (Sergei Kolesnikov) with no shortage of destructive resources at his disposal. It turns out that Koch and Kolesnikov used to be partners and together were responsible for the Chernobyl disaster; Koch has an incriminating file hes still keeping at the abandoned site so its off to the ruins for a battle royal. Willis and son quickly end up as disposable supporting players in a much larger production but they take their bullets and bruises and power through like Americans bonding along the way. ""Im on vacation"" Willis grumbles several times throughout A Good Day To Die Hard in what counts as the films sole running joke a lame placeholder until he arrives at the big ""yippee-ki-yay"" punchline. The line is supposed to play as weary and wry--classic McClane--but its lazy in the manner of Willis worst performances encouraged by a script that deals in obligatory action beats like an off-brand James Bond. (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber in the first Die Hard is one of the great movie villains of all time; the most colorful villain in Good Day nibbles a carrot while speechifying.) As with Live Free Or Die Hard Willis suffers injuries grievous enough to kill him a dozen times over--smashing through windows at high speed falling through floor after floor of scaffolding and getting whipped around in a helicopter like a ragdoll. Theres no danger threatening this digital cipher thus no tension and he and Courtney come off as a couple of asshole tough guys invulnerable to everything but a heartfelt father-son talk.

Opening this bullet-riddled snoozefest on Valentines Day seems particularly wrong-headed.The filmmakers make a feeble attempt to acknowledge that Bruce Willis is rather long in the tooth to pull off his old Die Hard stunts. (The franchise originated 25 years ago.) But in wannabe Expendables fashion it sends up his tough-guy image. Unlike The Expendables and its sequel the humor here isnt cheeky fun. The jokes are repetitive and mostly unfunny.STORY Bruce Willis and John McClane still find dying hardMORE Jai Courtney grabs the Die Hard legacy VIDEO Willis honored with giant muralPREMIERE Die Hard in LondonWillis reprises his iconic role as police detective John McClane. When he hears that his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) is in prison in Russia John goes looking for him. Dodging bullets and chasing bad guys who race around in tricked-out Hummers John repeats ""Im on vacation"" in what seems a desperate ploy to coin a lasting catchphrase. ""Make my day"" its not.What John finds out is that his son Jack is a CIA operative working undercover to protect government whistleblower Komarov (Sebastian Koch). When he learns this he calls Jack ""the 007 of Plainfield New Jersey.""The films first hour is more exciting than the second especially a prolonged car chase through the congested streets of Moscow.The second half is spent with father and son traipsing around the abandoned Chernobyl power plant the site of one of the worlds worst environmental disasters. But even though gunfire and explosions abound neither John nor Jack seem unduly worried about errant radioactivity.The Russian baddies try to be clever but their attempts at wit are just as poor as Willis and sons.""You know what I hate about Americans"" asks evil Russian henchman Alik (Rasha Bukvic). ""Everything. Especially cowboys.""Is that supposed to make our American blood boil or elicit an appreciative guffaw?Jack is anything but glad for a family reunion. Its no wonder since his father spouts cliches like ""Im not done talking to you"" in the midst of life-threatening mayhem.Jack does things by the book while John is a seat-of-the-pants kind of guy. Another key difference is their attitude toward cultural adaptation. Jack has learned to speak excellent Russian while John punches a guy on a Moscow street for speaking to him in Russian. ""Do you think I understand a word youre saying?"" he yells at the man.An American at his ugliest John inexplicably masters the complex Moscow highways almost upon arrival participating in a high-speed chase in a city hes never visited forcing a paramilitary team off the road in creative ways. Disbelief must not only be suspended but chucked at the door.When cars are in hot pursuit of one another the story is at least exciting. But once the action shifts to Chernobyl where Komarov and an accomplice have hatched a plan to steal millions of dollars worth of plutonium the story grows murky.All we really need to know is that father and son re-establish their bonds via massive rounds of ammo bloodshed and destruction.At least this latest Die Hard wasnt pegged to Fathers Day. 58 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/14RDzP6",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/02/13/a-good-day-to-die-hard-review/1915605/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,agooddaytodiehard28,agooddaytodiehard,usatoday
"A Good Day to Die Hard movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Days end McClane tale tapped out in final Die Hard  1/2 Video Tribune critics discuss A Good Day to Die Hard Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips discusses the film A Good Day to Die Hard with Tribune reporters Nina Metz and Chris Borrelli. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips discusses the film A Good Day to Die Hard with Tribune reporters Nina Metz and Chris Borrelli. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" isnt just the weakest of the ""Die Hard"" pictures; its a lousy action movie on its own terms even without comparing it to the adored 1988 franchise launch starring Bruce Willis as John McClane the New York cop whos a carnage magnet for all the terrorists and a supercool symbol of American might right and muttered wisecrack.Here Willis barely gets a piece of his own noisy zero-attention-span movie and he suffers the usual indignity of any action hero north of age 55. Ten seconds of his first scene passes before someone calls him ""Grandpa."" Traveling to Moscow to retrieve his estranged son whos in some kind of trouble McClane soon finds that his boy with the biceps played by the Australian actor Jai Courtney is really a CIA spook trying to keep a Russian dissident (Sebastian Koch from ""The Lives of Others"") alive long enough to turn over a verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry secretive top-secret file containing evidence against the dastardly defense minister. Sample dialogue ""We need this file."" And ""Just give me the file.""The first big car chase attempts to outrun equivalent scenes in both the ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Bourne"" series and folks I am here to tell you Its stupid. Its silly and overscaled enough to toss you straight out of the very movie youre supposed to be enjoying. From there screenwriter Skip Woods leads the warring factions to the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster where new bad things are happening and ultimately someone falls down down down the way Alan Rickman did in the first ""Die Hard"" but with a difference pointing to the devolution of the series. The slice-him-up gamer-style evisceration capping that fall is a long way from the comparatively classy send-off Rickman received in 88 as he went splat on the pavement the precise moment of impact left to the imagination. Director John Moore leaves nothing to the imagination unimaginatively and with a misjudged reliance on absurd digital effects. Moore shoots and cuts mayhem like a pluperfect hack All his previous assignments -- remakes of ""The Omen"" and ""Flight of the Phoenix"" the mechanical ""Max Payne"" -- have taught him little about pacing or mapping out a rangy action sequence. The father/son bickering grinds on with McClane the elder bemoaning his workaholic tendencies (""I just thought working all the time was a good thing yknow?"" he says at one point sounding like an absentee father Hollywood studio executive division).Its hard to keep a late-20th century franchise going to be sure but when you think of how good the recent James Bond films ""Casino Royale"" and ""Skyfall"" were the fifth ""Die Hard"" looks and feels cynically lazy. The story sets up limp adversaries for our hero one of whom seethes about the arrogance of the typical American ""cowboy"" just as Rickmans Hans Gruber (the greatest Bond villain never to appear in a Bond movie) went on once upon a time about McClane being ""just another American who saw too many movies as a child? Another orphan of a bankrupted culture who thinks hes John Wayne? Rambo? Marshall Dillon?""Fighting words But Willis looks pretty bored here. McClane has become a dour place-holder edition of his formerly relatable self. I enjoyed one bit -- a slow-motion sight gag involving Williss final kiss-off to an adversary surrounded by flames -- but it takes a long time to get there. This movie barely tops 90 minutes minus the end credits and everybody coming out of the screening the other night couldnt believe it wasnt a lot longer. A lot longer.

This latest caper feels like a real letdown in what has generally been an intelligent and exciting series -- where previous criminal plans were twisty and ingenious this ones awkward and nonsensical and while earlier action sequences may have been improbable and over-the-top they at least made some logical sense within the plot something the latest screenwriter apparently couldnt be bothered to address. Since McClane got to patch things up with his daughter in 2007s ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (and Mary Elizabeth Winstead gamely pops up for a cameo here) the grizzled cop now reaches out to his son traveling to Moscow when he finds out that Jack (Jai Courtney ""Jack Reacher"") has just been arrested for murder there. Also facing trial is former billionaire Komarov (Sebastian Koch) who plans to use his day in court to air dirty laundry about his former comrade Chagarin (Sergey Kolesnikov) whos about to be appointed defense minister. The elder McClane arrives on the scene just in time to create an international incident -- Jack as it turns out works for the CIA but the delay caused by encountering his dad messes up the transfer of Komarov to his fellow agents. The trio travels to a safe house that soon fails to live up to its name and suddenly theyre on the run from Chagarins goons as they try to dig up Komarovs file of evidence and flee the country. While the first ""Die Hard"" was a Swiss watch of precise plotting and layered character development -- the next three installments could at least tell time -- ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" makes lots of noise but little sense. Why for instance does John chase Jack through the streets of Moscow overturning cars and causing countless collisions when hes not even there in an official capacity? Say what you will about the car that downs a helicopter in ""Live Free"" it made sense in context. There are some entertaining explosions and shoot-outs to be found here but the ""Die Hard"" franchise has always been smart about juggling the action-movie money shots with sharp dialogue and characters whose quirks and tics felt somewhat realistic. Why this venerable series has been handed over to the writer of ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" and the director of ""Max Payne"" is anyones guess but these hacks do McClane and his fans no favors. When things arent blowing up were treated to the awkward ""you were never there for me"" father-son spats of Willis and Courtney both of whom have demonstrated elsewhere that theyre capable of juggling humor and machismo but the material doesnt deliver. Courtney is forced to spend the first half of the film in a bratty pout and their eventual ""Daddy Die Hard"" conversations about their parent-child issues are neither revelatory nor amusing. If ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" was meant to pass the reins from one generation to the next they at least got the casting right; with relatively few credits Courtney already comes off as versatile and striking enough to make a name for himself as an action hero. Without better writing and directing however let ""Die Hard"" die before the McClane name can be further besmirched. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Movie Review A Good Day to Die Hard an uninspired effort - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-StuntsMovie Review A Good Day to Die Hard an uninspired effortPlaying everyman action hero John McClane for the fifth time Bruce Willis seems to be just going through the motions as the numbingly elaborate stunts explode around him.February 13 2013|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Bruce Willis left Jai Courtney and Sebastian Koch star in ""A Good... (Frank Masi / 20th Century...)Given how successful its four predecessors have been its not surprising that ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" plays like an extended victory lap for star Bruce Willis and the entire ""Die Hard"" franchise. Not surprising but not overwhelmingly entertaining either.Starting with the original ""Die Hard"" in 1988 over the next quarter-century the series has grossed an estimated 1.2 billion worldwide a hefty sum which apparently convinced 20th Century Fox to commission this fifth time in the trenches for Willis regular-guy action hero New York City police Det. John McClane.Befitting such a storied enterprise director John Moore (""Max Payne"") has spared no expense or expertise in terms of action including orchestrating a gargantuan car chase that took hundreds of vehicles 2A1/2 months to complete and deploying (though not at the same time) an enormous 750-foot green screen and the 25-ton helicopter ""Miss Belarus"" on loan from that nation and the largest the world has ever known.PHOTOS Bruce Willis bombs and bangsHardware is one thing but inspiration is something else and in that area ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" comes up short. True a lot of stuff gets blown up and stunts that must have cost the Earth appear with startling regularity but the sense of exhilaration and fun that marked the best of the series has gone unaccountably AWOL.Having apparently worn out all domestic opponents McClane finds himself in Moscow on family business searching for a son he had a falling out with years before a son he is informed is now languishing in a Russian prison. Yes the breakup was ugly McClane admits grudgingly but ""hes still my kid.""Moscow as it turns out is hardly an oasis of calm. Russias president is pursuing a vendetta against former ally turned dissident Yuri Komarov played by German actor Sebastian Koch (a rivalry that might have been inspired by Vladimir Putins clashes with wealthy Russian rival Mikhail Khodorkovsky.) Komarov it seems is in possession of (gasp) an incriminating file that the president is desperate to get his hands on.Trying to get close to Komarov on the day of his show trial is none other than McClanes son Jack who turns out to be no ordinary criminal but (gasp again) a CIA agent who also wants to take possession of that scintillating file.Due to circumstances too circuitous to relate Jack and Komarov end up on the run together when in the most unlikely coincidence imaginable they literally bump into Jacks dad on the streets of Moscow where his congenital obtuseness helps derail Jacks careful plan. ""Five minutes"" he seethes to the old man ""to blow a three-year operation.""Wanting to help his son out bad blood notwithstanding McClane takes part in that massive car chase filmed both on Moscows Garden Ring and by a 190-person stunt unit that worked on the streets of Budapest. Auto enthusiasts will surely notice that key bad guy Alik (Rasha Bukvic) is driving a gargantuan custom-made MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) a vehicle that lets nothing stand in its way.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsFar from impressed by his sons status McClane whose parenting skills are rusty at best dismissively calls Jack ""the 007 of Plainfield N.J."" The petty rivalry between these two is more irritant than enticement even when McClane who is troubled by being called John by his son asks plaintively ""What happened to Dad?"" and Jack snaps back ""Good question.""Thrown together by contrived circumstances as they are father and son combine forces and attempt to get Komarov out of the country. He wont leave without his fetching daughter Irina (Yuliya Snigir) and then he has to stop at Chernobyl (not Grenoble as the geographically challenged McClane hopes) to pick up that coveted file.As written by Skip Woods ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is certainly twisty enough but the pro-forma nature of Willis performance a even his traditional ""yippee ki yay"" sounds muted a doesnt help a film that cannot be described as inspired.Victory laps can be pleasant enough but if no ones heart is in them whats the point?-------------------------------------------A Good Day to Die HardMPAA rating R for violence and languageRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesPlaying In general releasekenneth.turanlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESA Good Day to Die Hard has a bad day with the criticsFebruary 15 2013Willis saves the day movieJune 27 2007No publicist -- just Bruce and the die hardsJune 8 2007MORE STORIES ABOUTStuntsMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-die-hard-review20130214,0,7430849.story",200,agooddaytodiehard31,agooddaytodiehard,latimes

At the risk of sounding ungrateful for a fresh ""Die Hard"" sequel Russia needs its own John McClane movie the way Uncle Sam needs a bright red babushka. On the flimsiest of pretexts Bruce Willis obstinate hero travels all the way to Moscow to find trouble in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" teaming up with his long-lost son to stop a generic terrorist from stealing weapons-grade uranium from Chernobyl -- a subpar plot that feels suspiciously like someone tried to plug McClane into a preexisting screenplay. Foxs shaky bid to boost this installments international appeal could backfire domestically. Between this and 2007s PG-13-rated ""Live Free or Die Hard"" the studio seems determined to test audiences definition of a ""Die Hard"" movie. Is it enough to air-drop a bruised and bloody Bruce Willis into any old action movie and hope fans follow? Can the series keep trotting out half-forgotten family members -- a daughter played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the last one and now Jai Courtney as McClanes estranged son Jack -- to draw him into the fray? Enticed by either the attractive Russian market or the even more appealing incentives Hungary dangled for shooting in Budapest someone decided to send McClane abroad where the NYPD detective has no jurisdiction -- and no qualms about using his usual brute-force tactics to stay alive. Considering the original ""Die Hard"" pitted its modern-day cowboy against a squad of arch Nazi stereotypes four decades after World War II ended perhaps it follows that the series should dredge up an old Cold War adversary this time out conveniently ignoring the fact Chernobyl is as far from Moscow as Three Mile Island is from Detroit. And so the pic which runs a full reel shorter than its predecessors sends McClane to the former Soviet Union with a ridiculous plan to spring Jack from jail. (McClane literally saunters up to the courthouse at precisely the moment huge armored vehicles arrive to blow the place apart.) Little does he realize that Jack has things under control having been arrested as part of an elaborate CIA mission to arrange the defection of a well-connected political prisoner Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch) who claims to have a file with incriminating details on high-ranking government officials. Though not much of a MacGuffin its more than enough to get things rolling and director John Moore (""Behind Enemy Lines"") delivers an elaborate logistically daunting car chase around the capital featuring Jack and Komarov in a van a squad of heavily armed assassins in pursuit and third-wheel John bringing up the rear -- a surly papa bear determined to protect his endangered cub whether Jack wants his help or not. The entire sequence works like gangbusters giving the new Dolby Atmos super-surround system (debuted on ""Brave"") a real workout though it borrows a bit too heavily from other films in which Westerners have laid waste to rival cities. Generally speaking the action elements arent the problem here. Theyre certainly loud enough. Its the obligatory intra-family squabbling and preposterous plotting that threaten to derail this nonsensical sequel especially a series of swapped allegiances between Komarov and his daughter Irina (Yulia Snigir) a lethal stunner with her own share of daddy issues. Things go bang the McClanes get their share of battle scars and the trauma of it all proves the perfect bonding experience to heal old wounds. ""Need a hug?"" dad sarcastically asks his stand-offish son who seems to have inherited his sense of humor from the other side of the family. Willis still packs that rapscallion charm balancing his wisecracking reluctant-hero shtick with the unstoppable all-American quality that earned the original film its title. But the chemistry between him and Courtney is nonexistent with the younger thesp who makes co-star Cole Hauser look expressive adding so little to the equation one can only hope the studio doesnt plan to pass the franchise on to him. Watching this expendable action-packed sequel its impossible not to think in such cynical terms. To Foxs credit the series is permitted to return to its original R rating which means McClane can once again cuss freely. (Oddly cutting back on language rather than violence earned the previous pic a PG-13.) Still the closest thing to a new catch-phrase screenwriter Skip Woods can muster is the exasperated ""Some fuckin vacation"" -- a line that openly contradicts the reason the film sent him to Russia to begin with. What vacation? If this is McClanes idea of time away from the office theyd better send him back to work before he hits retirement age.

The unsinkable New York City cop played by Bruce Willis began by battling vaguely East German terrorists in 1988 then kept up with the times by hunting a Latin American dictator a fiendish bank-robber and in 2007 some ""cyber"" criminals. Now hes back to Cold War containment trying to stop renegade Russians from going nuclear. ""Its not 1986 you know"" says the Moscovite villain Alik (Rasha Bukvic) but tell that to the filmmakers. ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" feels like an ancient throwback with sneering Russkis weapons-grade uranium even a showdown in Chernobyl. This film is so dated that its climactic explosion engulfs a statue of Lenin. One new wrinkle is McClanes estranged son Jack (a serviceable Jai Courtney) now a Moscow-based CIA agent. For vague reasons John shows up and helps the kid rescue Komarov (Sebastian Koch) a political prisoner with dirt on a Putinesque ruler. Gruff attempts at father-son reconciliation occur between gunbattles and daring escapes. advertisement | advertise on newsday This ""Die Hard"" includes crunchy car chases and spectacular fireballs but forgets to give Willis McClane the grit wit and lip that made him such an action icon. Everything is handed to him (guns grenades and stylish leather jackets appear out of nowhere) yet he seems cranky and tired. He frequently mocks his injured son (""You need a hug?"") and his new refrain ""Im on vacation"" sounds more like a tourists complaint than a zippy tagline. Frenetically directed by John Moore from a sketchy script by Skip Woods ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" has the dubious distinction of making John McClane unlikeable. Hes had some bad days in the past but this one finally got him down.

David Brewster Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Stop me if youve heard this one before. New York City cop John McClane flies to a far-off metropolis to visit a family member and finds himself in the middle of a terrorist plot. If Harvard Business School wants to do a case study on how to debase a once-respected brand they neednt look any further than the ""Die Hard"" movies. The triumphant 1988 debut was slam-bang adrenaline-surging action with a rich vein of humor and a surprising amount of heart. With Bruce Willis cast as working-class hero McClane the film gave us a welcome counterpoint to smoothie super spies like James Bond. With no weapons but his street smarts he improvised a plan to liberate Nakatomi Towers from a band of sophisticated well-equipped terrorists. You could hardly follow him through the buildings elevator shafts and heating ducts picking off bad guys with surgical precision without yelling ""Yippie-ki-yay"" Each succeeding film slipped farther from the high-water mark established by director John McTiernan. His successors never recaptured that special blend of rocket-launcher impact and clever engrossing character study. Willis who came to the first ""Die Hard"" as an untested TV star with a lot to prove delivered progressively more complacent performances. Now comes ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" which puts McClane in Moscow amid a second-rate spy story with sappy trimmings of father-son reconciliation. He makes the trip to support his long-estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) whos facing a murder charge. What he doesnt know is that Jack is a CIA agent who deliberately put himself in the courtroom as part of a plot to obtain a file with damning evidence against a Russian leader. At first the McClane reunion doesnt go as warmly as John had hoped but he and Jack regain their familial bond by shooting up platoons of anonymous henchmen. Theres nothing like working on a project with your kid. Willis is in a lamentable phase of his career. Having proved himself a tremendously gifted actor in the right hands (revisit ""Moonrise Kingdom"" or ""Looper"" if you have any doubts) he often settles into interchangeable bald-man-with-machine-gun roles. Can anyone really distinguish between the characters he plays in ""The Expendables"" ""Red"" or this film? McClanes wit is tamped down even as the firepower is amped up. Director John Moore (""Max Payne"") is proficient with chaos and shrapnel -- theres a fine metal-crunching high-speed chase across several Moscow expressways -- but he hasnt a clue what to do with actors. The script by Kip Woods (""The A-Team"") offers few performing opportunities. Its a lumpy broth of exposition explosions and sorry-I-wasnt-there-for-you sentimentality. Nor is there a strong villain for McClane to battle. The story takes a long time to reveal who the real adversary is wasting time that should have been used to engineer a deadly duel of wits. Compare the uninspired ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" with the exhilarating ""Skyfall"" and you see the difference between pushing a franchise to riskier more demanding highs and letting it slide. The father-son design of the film suggests that the ""Die Hard"" series might be set to pass to the next generation of McClanes. Id say its a good day to call it quits. This film image released by 20th Century Fox shows Bruce Willis as John McClane right and Jai Courtney as his son Jack in a scene from ""A Good Day to Die Hard.""

In A Good Day to Die Hard the yippee-ki-yay mofo of an ex-cop now in his 50s and still embodied (after 25 years) by Bruce Willis may be what passes for an old guy in action-hero years. But McClane still knows how to...how does he put it? ""Go out and kill a lot of scumbags."" And how to crack wise. This time hes in Russia to bail his adult son Jack (Jai Courtney) out of trouble. Along the way father and son become embroiled in a very Boris Badenov-type pickle involving bad and even worse Russians and the rather tacky use of radioactive Chernobyl as a tough-guy plot point. The Australian-born Courtney doesnt make much of Jack. But then theres not much to make The kids got a noggin shaped like the old mans and hes a hothead off the old block. In the way of workaday flicks built around long-in-the-tooth badasses Die Hard 5 leaves room for McClane to make a few jokes about his thinning hair and to rue that he wasnt a better father when his kids were growing up. Oh boo-hoo. Now go kill some more scumbags.

Starring Bruce Willis Jai Courtney and Sebastian Koch. Directed by John Moore. (R. 97 minutes.) For the record the ""Die Hard"" series has not seen a weak entry until now. The first ""Die Hard"" (1988) remains an action movie benchmark. ""Die Hard 2"" (1990) was amazing at least in its time for special effects on a scale never before seen. ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" (1995) was not quite in that league but it was solid escapist entertainment and ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (2007) was the best in the series or tied for the best. Four good ones in a row. That almost never happens even in the James Bond series. But the streak ends with ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" which falls down in places where it should have excelled. It has a weak story that provides no tension feeling or interest. Its opening action sequence is just a long drawn-out dud filmed by director John Moore in the worst modern style of quick cuts and smeary jittery photography. Even Bruce Willis wisecracks arent funny and thats especially inexcusable Sure its difficult to write a good story and complicated to bring off a compelling action sequence. But if you have an actor like Bruce Willis waiting to get pages from you and you cant come up with a handful of funny lines for him to say then you really have no business writing a ""Die Hard"" movie.

But surely there must be something good to be said for ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" right? Actually no Ive saved the worst for last. You know that whole idea - the central conception of this installment - of having Willis share the spotlight with Jai Courtney as his screen son John McClane Jr.? Not good at all. It adds a note of sentiment but of false sentiment. And instead of watching McClane (Willis) deal confidently with villains we get to watch him treading lightly around his grown son hoping for his approval. As for Courtney its hard to know what to make of him here because the setting doesnt favor him. He seems to have a sturdy manly presence - and like a lot of his fellow Australians he has it at an early age. But he is playing a character as unwelcome as James Bond Jr. or Sherlock Holmes Jr. Who needs him when the original is standing right there? Moreover the screenplay makes the colossally dumb mistake of having Junior despise his father. Somebody should have figured out that the audience really likes McClane so to see Junior giving him a hard time just gets that character off on the wrong foot. The not-quite-fun begins when McClane hears that his son has been arrested in Russia for shooting someone in a nightclub. McClane flies out to Moscow to see what he can do to help and he accidentally finds himself present when his son is in a shootout trying to free himself from police custody. It turns out as we soon find out that the son is a CIA agent. Somehow McClane and his daughter - Juniors sister - didnt know that though of course they should have. There is very little story to ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" just the father-son element and something involving an effort to get a Russian businessman (Sebastian Koch) safely out of the country. Most of the action involves Senior and Junior chasing after and killing bad guys - McClane actually says ""Lets kill some bad guys"" alluding to the movies as though he werent himself a movie cliche but merely referencing one. Willis may not be the films saving grace but he is some kind of grace nonetheless really the only thing in the movie. And the climactic action sequence is reasonably entertaining - not well thought out not especially imaginative but amusing enough. Theres no gold here just a little straw and you end up grasping at it. By the way have you ever noticed that though planes rarely crash in movies at least 50 percent of all helicopters shown in feature films end up exploding? Food for thought.

(Frank Masi SMPSP) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday February 13 2013 234 PM Title A Good Day to Die Hard Film Info With Bruce Willis. New York cop John McClane heads to Russia to help his son. Director John Moore (137) R Violence. Area theaters. Its ironic that Beethovens Ninth Symphony ""Ode to Joy"" is heard briefly during the opening of ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" and used prominently in its TV ads. Because this leaden flick is completely joyless. That music played a major role in 1988s ""Die Hard"" which after 25 years still stands tall as one of the best action adventures ever made. Its pull remains almost primal. Just try to turn it off if you cruise past it on cable TV. ""Die Hard"" is inexhaustibly perfect. Not so with this fourth sequel. Were introduced first to a pair of Russians -- Yuri Komarov a billionaire on trial for his life and Viktor another billionaire afraid of what Yuri will say in court (are you in a no-care zone yet?). In New York Bruce Willis John McClane is concerned for his son Jack whom he hasnt seen in years. Informed that Jacks in Russia McClane heads to Moscow. There he finds Jack is a CIA agent assigned to bust Komarov out of jail because of a mysterious ""file"" that could lead to a cache of uranium. McClane tags along grabbing guns to chip in with ""killing all the scumbags."" Along the way the NYPD vet tries to reconnect with his surly boy. Director John Moore (""Max Payne"") replaces the intricate puzzle of the first film and even 1995s New York-set nothing-to-be-ashamed-of ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" with dusty construction sites and mannequin factories. And thats even before we arrive in Chernobyl. The editing is jumpy (one scene changes as a bloodied McClane is caught mid-spit) opportunities to feel ""Die Hard""-ish are lost (a goofy cabbie looks to be an ally much like Reginald VelJohnson in the original but the character is never seen again) and the action veers between bombastic whoppers and turgid run-and-shoots. A tap-dancing carrot-chomping villain wouldve been eaten alive by Alan Rickmans Hans Gruber in the original movie. Ultimately even more than 2007s ""Live Free or Die Hard"" ""Good Day"" never lets McClane be McClane. Gone is his taunting snark and quick-witted preparedness; instead he seems like a jerk with a thing for guns. Willis looks bored his charisma on autopilot as he waits for his paycheck to clear. When someone tells him ""not to make an even bigger mess of things"" by movies end that seems pretty hard to do. Magic Moment A leap from a helicopter. On mobile?

Cast Bruce Willis Jai Courtney Sebastian Koch. Rating R for violence and language. RELATED NEWS Goody Can Bruce Willis still bring it? Dont bet against him By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Feb 13 2013 208 PM At one point in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" the latest and rather lackluster installment in the long-running action franchise someone asks John McClane if he goes looking for trouble or if it just manages to find him. ""You know"" McClane again played with what can only be described as deadpan deadpanness by Bruce Willis muses ""After all these years I ask myself that same question."" Really? Really? Come on John how many ridiculously dangerous and violent situations do you have to wander into before the answer becomes obvious? You lead an awfully adventurous life even for a cop no? Seemingly having exhausted all domestic opportunities for saving the day this time McClane goes international to Russia to try to help his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney). What follows is a daddy-issues movie punctuated by exploding cars helicopters and the occasional skull. Director John Moore knows what the audience is here to see and he gives it to them; the opening chase scene seemingly lasts about a third of the movie. Jack as far as John knows is a neer do well. When he gets word that Jack is sitting in a Russian jail he isnt surprised. What John doesnt know is that Jack is actually a CIA agent who has spent three years on a detailed mission involving a political prisoner (Sebastian Koch) a mission that John manages to wreck in a few minutes. The appeal of John McClane over all these years is that he is an ordinary man placed in extraordinary (OK extra-extraordinary) circumstances. Yes hes a trained police officer which helps but what he really is is a guy who wants to do the right thing and does it even if it means throwing the occasional bad guy off a tall building or something. Here he is more an observer watching with silent maybe reluctant pride as his son does a lot of the butt-kicking. Of course for these guys its a father-son activity so John gets his licks in too. In-between acts of violence and sometimes right in the middle of them the two men work out their family issues. John was a bad father Jack feels neglected look out because that guy over there has a machine gun. There are a few twists and without giving too much away there are some daddy issues going on over on the bad-guy side of the fence too. Unfortunately the bad guys are too nondescript. Not everyone can measure up to Alan Rickman in the original ""Die Hard."" Few can in fact. But Willis needs someone to work against someone to bounce his quips off of. Someone that is who isnt playing his son. A running joke in the film is the Russians hatred of Americans ""especially cowboys."" Their arrogance is off-putting one evildoer complains as he sizes up father and son McClane. ""Its not 1986 anymore"" he says. No its not. But the bigger problem is that its not 1988 anymore either. Thats when ""Die Hard"" was released and while some of the sequels have been entertaining enough ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" signals that it may be a better day for John McClane to retire.

Actually Bruce what stinks is the script -- which is woefully lacking the kind of one-liners and memorable bad guys that helped make working-class hero McClane so iconic hes still around after 25 years. Even the action sequences are pretty much by the numbers this time. Which is something Im pained to report. Willis who keeps getting better with age (hes 57) is one of my favorite actors with two films (""Moonrise Kingdom"" and ""Looper"") on my most recent 10-Best list. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" may have treaded water six years ago but in the end Willis charisma managed to keep it afloat. Inexplicably saddled by Fox with director John Moore (of the stillborn ""The Omen"" reboot) and screenwriter Skip Woods (who worked similar wonders with the studios ""The A-Team"") Willis can perform no such miracles this time around. McClane heads for the Russian capital after his estranged son Jack (bland Australian actor Jai Courtney) is arrested there under murky circumstances. The detective turns up just in time to witness an explosive courthouse escape by junior and a dissident (Sebastian Koch) that junior was allegedly supposed to testify against. Though he has no idea of whats going on (neither do we) McClane commandeers several vehicles in pursuit of the heavily armed (but dull) bad guys who are chasing the son and the dissident. This 20-minute chase has some impressive stunt driving but practically no dialogue and many awkwardly edited reaction close-ups of Willis at the wheel. McClane is shocked shocked to eventually learn that Junior is a CIA agent -- ""the James Bond of Plainfield New Jersey"" as he puts it -- and was involved in busting the dissident out of jail so he could provide evidence to bring down a Russian politician. If youre asking why the CIA would even care about getting a Russian political prisoner out of jail ""A Good Day To Die Hard"" is probably the wrong movie for you. The answer to this -- and exactly why the McClanes tiresomely bicker throughout the film -- may well have ended up on the cutting room floor. Theres evidence of panicked last-minute editing on this film which at 97 minutes is by far the shortest in a series whose previous installments each clocked in at more than two hours. But trust me this one still moves so slowly that it feels like its longer than two hours. All of which would be forgivable if we cared in the slightest about that crooked Russian politician (Sergei Kolesnikov) and his scheme. Or if his chief henchman (Radivoje Bukvic) had something wittier to say than ""You know what I hate about Americans? Everything. Especially cowboys."" The dissidents double-dealing daughter (Yuliya Snigir) is decorative but not a whole lot more interesting or even particularly menacing. With McClane Juniors CIA partner (Cole Hauser) disposed of early on hes forced to very reluctantly team up with Dad for a road trip to Chernobyl. There the bad guys magically exterminate all that pesky radiation so they can smuggle out some . . . well theres a good chance you will have guessed this 20 minutes earlier. Basically its all a setup for a CGI-heavy climax in which a helicopter and a whole lot of other things get blown up real good. Mr. Willis has said in interviews that hes open to a sixth ""Die Hard"" film. Next time Bruce please read the script.

Frank Masi Bruce Willis (left) Jai Courtney and Sebastian Koch in a scene from ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Frank Masi) Frank Masi This film image released by 20th Century Fox shows Bruce Willis as John McClane right and Jai Courtney as his son Jack in a scene from ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Frank Masi) ""Its not 1986"" says the Russian villain who is torturing American cop John McClane. Yet the way that this latter-day Boris Badenov scoffs at the name Ronald Reagan and relishes killing cowboys we could swear that the evil empire has struck back with a vengeance.A lot of swearing will greet ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" much of it from loyal fans of the franchise who wont understand a damn thing thats happening. This outsourced sequel is like a Siberian fever dream in which the loudest and craziest inmate gets to be the new czar.Apparently battle-scarred New York peacekeeper McClane (Bruce Willis) has traveled uninvited to Moscow because his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) got caught in a turf war between a billionaire (Sebastian Koch) and a bureaucrat (Sergei Kolesnikov). Jack is working undercover for the CIA and wants the rich guy to spill the borscht about loose nukes. But a corrupt politician is willing to destroy half the city to keep it from happening.Family loyalty or knee-jerk jingoism requires that the elder McClane jump into the middle of this Muscovite mayhem stealing SUVs steamrolling pedestrians and shooting every machine gun east of the Iron Curtain. The first 20 minutes of this movie expends enough cars and capital to power another peasant revolt and yet nobody in the lawless city seems to notice. And then for inexplicable reasons the action shifts to the radioactive reactor at Chernobyl where the billionaire has stashed either a secret file or a pair of blue jeans. The McClanes and the strangely vague villains decide that its worth incinerating the rest of Ukraine to find out.To its infinitesimal credit the movie makes sure that every absurdly overblown action sequence is followed by the superficially bloodied Willis dusting himself off and complaining that hes on vacation. And then the son who hasnt been a factor in four previous movies makes a joke about their relationship as if were supposed to get it.Maybe the Russians have a secret formula for understanding this gibberish. To paraphrase a classic of Reagan-era cinema ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is a bad day to stop sniffing glue.What ""A Good Day to Die Hard""  Two stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 137  Content Violence and strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""
