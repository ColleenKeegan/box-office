Opening simultaneously at the multiplex two movies pushed at the outer limit of big-studio weirdness each in their own way epistemological essays on the impossibility of communication and stubbornly committed to techniques of estrangement. Both were greeted to varying degrees of hostility by accusations of incoherence yet both went on to secure critical reappraisal and passionately devoted cults Steven Spielbergs sci-fi dissertation A.I. Artificial Intelligence and . . . Pootie Tang. They aint come one but many tine tanies.Elaborated barely from a routine originating on The Chris Rock Show Pootie Tang has basically one joke and the movie works or not depending on whether you find it inexhaustibly funny or intolerably stupid. Movie star recording artist corporate crime fighter ladies man and master of the ceramic arts Pootie (Lance Crouther) is a man of many hats and few words--all of them pure gibberish. The gist of Pootiespeak (""wa da tai"" ""cole me down on the panny sty"") is an affectionate burlesque of blacksploitation jive and hip-hop slang as well as of the action-hero catchphrase.The movie opens on the set of a Bob Costas interview program where Pootie promotes his latest film Sine Your Pitty on the Runny Kine. Written and directed by Louis C.K. Pootie Tang is framed as an extended excerpt of this magnum opus a desultory mash of biopic anti-corporate action flick and randomly generated nonsense. Featuring both the greatest of all bullet-time parodies (slow-mo Pootie repelling projectiles with his braided ponytail) and the least likely of homages to John Cage (Pootie recording a smash single composed of pure silence) the movie is deliriously poised ""somewhere between blaxploitation spoof and avant-garde freak-out"" as Dennis Lim wrote in his admiring notice for the Village Voice.If Lim were among the few early champions of Pootie Tang he wasnt alone in prophesying its cult destiny. Variety grudgingly acknowledged the potential in a review that derided ""one of the most amateurish features ever release by a major studio"" for the nonsensical doldrums of its aggressive ""non-style."" Pootie Tang is beyond question a movie with a flagrant disregard for consistency of any kind but its precisely this dum-dum Dada multiplicity that its devotees embrace.Where Pootie Tangs verbal incoherence is the explicit gag of the movie Pootie Tangs narrative visual and tonal incongruity lends it a totalized feeling of radical absurdity. The general look is slightly aggrandized TV--albeit as shot by Willy Kurant cinematographer on Godards Masculin Feminin--that spontaneously erupts in shitty b-roll montages ersatz Hype Williams music-video interludes psychedelic graphic design and all manner of supremely idiotic non sequiturs.Pootie Tang works in part because it doesnt. Which is to say the movies special success is inextricable from the moments--and there are many--where it blatantly fails. It is one of the most amateurish features ever released by a major studio full of manic unfocused energy and shameless semi-inscrutable silliness as well as a sweetness and lack of cynicism reflected by its cheerful cult. The movie exerts a beguiling charm that can only be explained as the je ne sais quoi of sa da tay.92YTribeca will celebrate the 10th anniversary of Pootie Tang with a screening and post-film conversation with star Lance Crouther on November 7.

Developed to barely feature length (running time of the ""narrative"" itself is 70 minutes) from a five-minute comic bit created for ""The Chris Rock Show"" nonsensical conceit about a self-styled gibberish-spouting superhero and crooner plays like a one-joke sketch extended way beyond its natural boundaries. ""Pootie Tang"" has the distinction of being one of the most amateurish features ever released by a major studio. Developed to barely feature length (running time of the ""narrative"" itself is 70 minutes with more than 10 minutes of languorous end credits and innumerable alt and outtakes tacked on) from a five-minute comic bit created for ""The Chris Rock Show"" nonsensical conceit about a self-styled gibberish-spouting superhero and crooner plays like what it is a one-joke sketch extended way beyond its natural boundaries. Overpriced even on its paltry 3.5 million budget this lame little items only hope is that opening weekend auds mistake it for a real Chris Rock picture (he co-produced and pops up in multiple roles throughout) although cult following for the character and titles promise of something more tasty than whats delivered should enable pic to turn a profit. The joke in question is the incomprehensible language spoken by Pootie Tang (Lance Crouther). This very hip-sounding lingo makes PT sound cooler than anyone else around and everyone pretends to understand it so as not to be uncool. Gag worked at five minutes and created a certain profile for the character who wears outlandish threads is a singing sensation has the ladies in a dither and sends terror into the hearts of bad guys with the thought of his all-powerful belt which he snaps with the skill of a martial arts master. ""Plot"" has PT menaced by gangster Dirty Dee (Reg E. Cathey) who lives up to his name as hes hilariously covered with filth at all times and by dastardly corporate overlord Dick Lecter (Robert Vaughn) who manufactures the evil trio of cigarettes booze and burgers and resents PTs influential public service campaign against his products. Lecter uses his slinky g.f. (Jennifer Coolidge) to entrap the normally invulnerable hero and steal his mystical belt whereupon PT retreats to rural life before making a comeback. Any synopsis will inevitably confer more narrative logic and coherence on ""Pootie Tang"" than it actually possesses just as any attempt at describing its non-style (a sort-of combination of very early Woody Allen with pathetic stabs at ""Austin Powers"" mod affectations) will automatically make it seem more attractive than it ever is. Scene after scene just sits there to no discernible effect with Crouther carrying on his laidback inscrutable lingo when hes talking at all while other thesps rant at top volume as if to take up the slack. It took 10 producers to get this up on the screen which should provide further ammo for the Producers Guild in its effort to combat credits featherbedding. Having invented the Pootie Tang character and handed it off to his fellow ""Chris Rock Show"" writer Crouther to play Louis C.K. is credited with having directed the pic although that would appear to be overstating the case.

Paramount Pictures photo by K.C. Bailey via Associated Press Pootie Tang milks retro black culture for silly fun 1 / 1 Back to Gallery POOTIE TANG Comedy. Starring Lance Crouther Wanda Sykes Chris Rock. Written and directed by Louis C.K. (PG-13. 81 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As an illustration of what dimension ""Pootie Tang"" is operating in note that the girls singing the theme song form D-grade girl group No. 702 -- no destiny all child. Is the movie kidding? Hope so because its funny anyway. A little parody a little dis much jiggy in-joke ""Pootie Tang"" which opened yesterday without a screening for critics is mostly an amusing exercise in black vernacular searching for a point. Pootie played by Lance Crouther was born as a sketch on HBOs ""Chris Rock Show."" Hed come into the studio or show up ""via satellite"" nonplussed and speaking in a country pig Latin that host Rock could easily understand. (""Sa da tai Chris"" etc.) Most of the shows cast -- including Mario Joyner and the peerless Wanda Sykes playing a forecast of what to expect from Lil Kim in those middle years -- tags along for the movie adventure the way the Muppets took Manhattan blissfully ignorantly. Bob Costas as himself is on hand to do what Milton Berle et al. did in those Muppet movies act as if he knows whats going on. Pootie is a ghetto superstar par excellence -- corny-cool right down to his cheap tinted shades and wide-open short-sleeve shirts. He looks like a Commodore trying to get backstage at a Teena Marie-Rick James concert. A magic belt bequeathed to Pootie by his late dad (one of a few roles played by Rock) is his crime-fighting lightsaber. (The movies most hysterical running gag is the way the film snakes backward giving the seamless appearance that post- brawl Pootie is putting the belt back around his waist.) When hes not recording ironic soundless ditties Pootie Tang is out doing public service announcements to keep the kids of America sober off drugs and as far away from cheeseburgers and chicken as possible. His PSAs have driven evil empire Lecter Corp.s profits into the ground. Eventually Dick Lecter (played wizened and with tragic dye-job by Robert Vaughn) dispatches his temptress (Jennifer Coolidge) to weaken Pootie so that Lecter can steal his belt and make him do malt liquor ads. Redemption is around the corner but it may as well be on Mars it takes so long to come. On the show the character exploited the line between gibberish and jive. The movie written and directed by ""Chris Rock Show"" director Louis C.K. follows suit. Most of ""Tangs"" sequences are like anorexic Hype Williams videos -- colorless under-edited intentionally inconsequential. The film is out to mock the place where hip-hop and blaxploitation meet. As it turns out the shoddy assembly and low-budget sheen are its best critique of the retro-fabulousness the film is satirizing. --Advisory This film contains comic violence comic sex and raw language.

(Paramount Pictures) ""Pootie Tang"" is a wretch-a-sketch a two-minute character-based skit (an occasional feature on HBOs ""The Chris Rock Show"") stretched to a mind-boggling 82 minutes. Pootie (Lance Crouther) is in the tradition of Chewbacca Mushmouth and Kenny - somehow people understand him even though he speaks in a mumbled mess of made-up slang. A part-time crime fighter and rap star who has somehow become a hero and role model for da youngstas Pootie and his magic belt battle corporate evil embodied by CEO Dick Lecter (poor Robert Vaughn) who wants kids to become addicted to his companys fast food cigarettes and alcohol. Limited hilarity ensues as the film sends up gangsta rap videos kung fu flicks and 70s blaxploitation films though its mostly absent what might pass for wit in the Wayans world. Populated with idiot cameos (Bob Costas call your agent - and fire him) and half-baked caricatures (Wanda Sykes as Biggy Shorty and Chris Rock himself in several guises) ""Pootie Tang"" is hysterical without ever being particularly funny. Writer-director Louis C.K. worked on Rocks show where Crouther and Sykes were longtime writers and collaborators. ""Pootie Tang"" (PG-13 82 minutes) - Contains sexual innuendo language and drug content. Area theaters.

Cathey Chuck Jeffreys Chris Rock Wanda Sykes Robert Vaughn; Guest Performer Conan OBrien Andy Richter; Director Louis C.K.; Author Louis C.K.; Producer (group) 3 Arts Entertainment Alphaville Films MTV Films; Release Date Wide 06/29/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 82; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted June 28 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT How awesome is Pootie Tang the trash talking fashion plate street rap superhero? Hes so awesome that when he records a new single that consists literally of silence (complete with mimed gospel screams in the recording studio) the whole world is enthralled. Thats a gag as innocuously broad as anything in ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" and the amiably silly ""Pootie Tang"" offers more of the same. As Pootie who speaks in an incomprehensible argot of hip-hop baby talk (""Im gonna sine your pity on the runny kine Sipi-tai"") Lance Crouther suggests the young Billy Dee Williams dolled up like Busta Rhymes playing a daffy Sean Combs in a 21st century spoof of ""Superfly."" Chris Rock served as one of the films producers (he makes several on screen appearances as well) and as brilliant as Rock can be this material is a reflection of his shallow moralistic side; it defangs its target instead of savaging it. The name ""Pootie Tang"" is bandied about so often that you may feel like stopping the movie to say ""Joke received.""
