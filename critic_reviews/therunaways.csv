A spunky 9-year-old convinces his town in County Cork Ireland to come to the aid of a shady Colombian whos crashed a small plane nearby in ""The Runway"" a blandly formulaic pic whose boldest stroke is tossing a few swear words into the Irish blarney. Debuting feature helmer Ian Power also scripting has assembled a relatively pleasant package but its old enough to grow whiskers -- tonally a cross between ""E.T."" and a minor Disney family-friendly film from the 1960s. Notwithstanding an award in Galway ""Runway"" is only likely to take off at kid fests and cable. Young Luxembourg shingle Lucil Film provided extra funds manpower and interior locations helping to foot the 3.4 million budget with top-billed Irish outfit Fastnet Films. The inspiration for the story comes from a near-forgotten 1983 news item about a South American pilot crash-landing in rural Cork; the improbability of such a tale certainly piques interest yet Powers fictionalized twists feel forced. Nothing much happens in Dromoleen though Paco (Jamie Kierans) holds onto a bit of mystery by imagining the father he never knew to be a romantic Spaniard. Mom Grace (Kerry Condon) doesnt clear up that question; nor does the script but Pacos determination to one day meet his Iberian padre inspires him to listen to Spanish-lingo tapes as he goes to sleep. The language lessons come in handy when a plane crashes into a field and pilot Ernesto (Demian Bichir Castro in ""Che"") has to explain himself. As the sole semi-Spanish speaker in the area Paco becomes official translator though he winds up inventing a sob story about Ernesto needing to get medicine for sick townsfolk back in Colombia. Despite increasing signs that the pilots story doesnt add up the locals chip in to repair the plane and build a runway because as Ernestos told ""I dont know who ya are but this town got a whole lot better after you showed up."" ""Warmhearted"" will be the adjective most used to describe the pic Powers main goal is to play on auds nostalgia for a dreamy time past when people altruistically helped each other. Though striving for a touch of Frank Capra ""The Runway"" is more Norman Tokar mild and inoffensive (though a jokey IRA scene is of questionable taste). Perfs are everything theyre expected to be -- solid enough within the limitations of the unchallenging script. Visuals are attractive and suitably uncomplicated. Music however is poorly used clumsily enabled by a superfluous pirate radio DJ (Mark Doherty) playing indie Irish rock. Rather than reinforcing mood or assisting elisions between scenes the tunes are just distracting.

The true story of The Runaways - five LA teens who formed an all-girl rock group and had a fistful of classics before imploding amid self-righteous recrimination - reads like the archetypal rock biopic plot. Pop-vid veteran Floria Sigismondi shoots with gorgeous sun-kissed super-saturation and her recreation of the sleazy 70s proto-punk scene is flawless. Even the mainstream cast - including Dakota Fanning and pouty Twilight misanthrope Kristen Stewart -  seems to be having fun with the juicy riot-grrrl roles. Fanning is particularly impressive as exploited pubescent princess Cherie Currie whose downfall forms the films central thread.But perhaps owing to Sigismondis lack of long-form experience it never comes together. Isolated scenes look stunning but The Runaways never establishes a consistent mood hopping from rebellious exuberance to doom-laden music industry critique. It doesnt help that the scripts central point about the exploitation of young girls is contradicted by the material - Joan Jett became one of rocks most respected women - and undermined by a camera which lingers lovingly even leeringly on 16-year-old Fannings scantily clad body. The result is an entertaining mess lively and stylish but frustratingly inconsequential.

BOTTOM LINE A wild trippy ride that could have been wilder. CAST Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning Michael Shannon LENGTH 145 The most shocking thing about ""The Runaways"" is how tame it feels. After all the real-life story of the Runaways the groundbreaking all-girl rock band is a wild one filled with larger-than-life characters including the great Joan Jett singer Cherie Currie and their manager Kim Fowley. However though ""The Runaways"" takes place during the promiscuous drug-fueled late 70s much of it seems oddly restrained alternating between art-house film and after-school special - especially when Jett takes on her guitar teacher and when Currie mimes David Bowie for a school assembly. Aside from Fowleys graphic rocker boot-camp insults greasily delivered by Michael Shannon and a few cocaine-snorting scenes with Jett (Kristen Stewart) and Currie (Dakota Fanning) ""The Runaways"" doesnt really reflect the bombast of the bands music or its aggressive often combative sexuality. advertisement | advertise on newsday Instead it is dominated by claustrophobic rehearsal scenes in the bands trailer in overcrowded clubs and in small recording studios. Director Floria Sigismondi best known for her videos with Marilyn Manson and the White Stripes occasionally throws in some music video visuals to shake things up but not nearly enough to reflect the material. Thats not to say ""The Runaways"" isnt entertaining. Stewart and Fanning are excellent - definitely believable as rockers with vocals that match up nicely to the originals and as troubled teens looking for a way to fit in. But it all comes up a bit short. imageCaption ""The Runaways"" is cool but the Runaways were just so much cooler.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post If the band biopic ""The Runaways"" puts a gentler -- barely -- spin on rock n rolls ""live fast die young"" mantra its only because the teenage girls who made up the mid-70s music act of the title had bodies slightly more forgiving of excess. And excess is abundant in photographer and music-video director Floria Sigismondis energetic debut. Theres sex. We already mentioned drugs. And the R-rated rock n roll saga isnt for tweens or even mid-teens unless they dig darkly cautionary tales. ""Twilight"" moper Kristen Stewart plays aching- to-jam guitar player Joan Jett. Sixteen-year-old Dakota Fanning brings angst and attitude to lead singer Cherie Currie. Sigismondi takes pains with some too-literal editing to honor the very different characters lives before the So-Cal girls meet at Rodney Bingen heimers club English Disco in L.A. Michael Shannon is a one-man freak show as rock manager Kim Fowley. Hes the mad marketeer behind the bands conceit Rockers -- Jett and founding members Lita Ford and Sandy West-- meet sex-kitten Currie. With a bad haircut and square jaw Fowley looks like a less stitched-and-bolted version of Frankensteins monster. He has plenty of moments of being a beast. For all its guitar-riff come-ons ""The Runaways"" is a portrait of a popular art form as abusive -- or at least powerfully negligent. When the girls run low on dough on their first road trip Fowleys not there. Theyre left in the pill-dispensing hands of a roadie. Sure hes there when they sign a record deal. But hes AWOL for a Beatlemania trauma they encounter on tour in Japan. If theres doubt about the veracity of Shannons air-sucking scene-gobbling antics as the Svengali behind the girls in the band consult former Runaways bassist Victory Tisch ler-Blues intimate 2004 documentary about the band ""Edgeplay A Film About The Runaways."" Yes Fowley screamed a blue streak at them -- at some more than others. Yes he put the newbie rockers through a sort of bootcamp where hed bring in kids to taunt and torment them while they played. It was good practice for dodging missiles -- verbal and otherwise -- in the clubs theyd play. Yes in interviews after the band and Fowley part ways he has a kind of pathological remove about his role in their lives. Joan Jett (nee Joan Marie Larkin) should be the more interesting figure not least because she proved such a kick-tail survivor when she resurrected herself first as a solo act then with the Blackhearts. And one of the bonuses of thinking about the ""The Runaways"" has been jamming to ""Cherry Bomb"" and ""Bad Reputation"" in the car. So one might expect that the black-haired guitarist would be the star of this show. (Jett has an executive-producer credit). But Stewart plays it intensely cool and Jetts inner workings are a mystery. That she loves rock n roll remains much of what we know. Its Fanning who gives the uncorked performance. If the young star hadnt made ""Hounddog"" (in which her character was raped and for which Fanning got a startling amount of ink) her turn as the teen sex bomb might have been as disturbing as Curries exploits as a ""jailbait"" rocker were. Instead she pulls off a vital melding of innocent and performer and wild thing and exploited kid. Elvis Presleys granddaughter Riley Keough does nice good job portraying the one left out -- Cheries twin sis Marie. Hows that for rock cred?

David Moir/Apparition Films/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The all-girl 1970s teenage rock band The Runaways is the subject of a new film called - what else? - ""The Runaways."" It stars Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett and Dakota Fanning as Cherie Currie the groups two most charismatic - i.e. screwed up - members. If like me you didnt follow this cult band the film based on Curries autobiography and written and directed by rock video artist Floria Sigismondi will probably seem fresher than it would to people who already know the lyrics to say ""Cherry Bomb."" Sigismondi was clearly attempting to avoid the usual rock-movie glitz-and-glory tropes and she perhaps does too good a job. Much of ""The Runaways"" plays out in the key of dreary. But theres a flinty integrity in this movies look at the rock grind and Stewart and Fanning are intensely watchable. Grade B (Rated R for language drug use and sexual content - all involving teens.)

Starring Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning Scout Taylor-Compton Alia Shawkat Michael Shannon Tatum ONeal Johnny Lewis Brett Cullen Stella Maeve Director Floria Sigismondi Running time 145 Release Opened Apr 9 2010  Editorial Review When the girls got up on stageBy Ann HornadayFriday April 9 2010""The Runaways"" a swift stylized coming-of-age film about the germinal 1970s all-girl rock band begins with an audacious punk-rock flourish when the bands lead singer Cherie Currie played by Dakota Fanning unexpectedly gets her first menstrual period. The first image of this impressionistic pared-down movie -- so distilled and formulaic that its almost an abstract version of the classic musical biopic -- is the fateful drop of blood as it hits the L.A. pavement.Writer-director Floria Sigismondi making her feature debut after a career producing music videos for Marilyn Manson the White Stripes and others has adapted Curries memoir of her brief blaze of rock stardom and reduced it to its most cardinal elements. ""The Runaways"" compresses and condenses so much of the bands nearly five-year run that it suggests they basically had one gig together in Tokyo before breaking up in a flurry of Curries drug abuse troubled family life and diva temperament.Because ""The Runaways"" is based on Curries book and because Runaways co-founder Joan Jett was a producer its no surprise that they claim pride of place in the movies schematic narrative. Kristen Stewart making the most of her hunched hooded persona portrays Jett as the steady serious and most sexually liberated member of the group. (Jett at one point teaches a bandmate to have an orgasm and later has an affair with Currie an episode Sigismondi portrays in a hazy montage of drugs rock-and-roll and roller skates.) Fanning whose wide-eyed sun-kissed innocence recalls Kate Hudsons breakout performance in ""Almost Famous"" teeters as if on Curries own vertiginous platform heels between little girl and grown-up in a role that often demands seeing Currie as both simultaneously.Its a shame that ""The Runaways"" is told mostly from Curries point of view (shes the only character we see living a life outside rehearsals and performances) because its Jetts drive and ambition that seem to have held the fragile ensemble together during its brief run and that made her a star after the Runaways broke up. She remains a cipher in a film that favors tone over characterization. (As for the rest of the Runaways here theyre relegated to background noise.) Oddly its band manager and producer Kim Fowley -- played by Michael Shannon in a flamboyantly foul-mouthed turn as a gender-bending Svengali -- who gets the most memorable moments in ""The Runaways"" spouting epigrams such as ""Its not about womens lib its about womens libido"" and ""Its press not prestige.""While Jett and Currie emerge as blurry half-formed characters Shannons Fowley brings the contradictions the Runaways embodied into sharp biting focus. Even as they upended sexist stereotypes about macho strutting and who rightly claims the symbolic phallic power of an electric guitar they were being exploited by a Fagin-like manipulator who sought only to cash in on their jailbait poses and Curries Lolita-like presence.Sigismondi leaves it to viewers to decide whether the Runaways were simply a manufactured novelty act a bold expression of female empowerment or a little bit of both. Rather than polemic or literalism shes far more interested in -- and adept at -- capturing the time and place that gave birth to the band the 1970s Los Angeles captured so vividly in ""Boogie Nights"" ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" and ""Mayor of the Sunset Strip"" whose subject the rock impresario Rodney Bingenheimer was part of the Runaways scene.

The rest of this spirited messy movie proves just how colossally wrong that teacher was. Jett shot to superstardom in the 1980s with her band the Blackhearts on the strength of a string of radio-friendly hits marked by her defiant attitude snarling vocals and thunderous insanely catchy guitar hooks. Before the Blackhearts though there were the Runaways the group that taught Jett the tricky ropes of the rock-star life. Written and directed by Floria Sigismondi and based partly on the memoirs of Runaways lead singer Cherie Currie (played here by Dakota Fanning) The Runaways focuses primarily on the formation of the psyches of these young women in the tumultuous 1970s - how they learned to exploit their sexuality while simultaneously overcoming the eras chauvinistic attitudes. Coached by the sleazy promoter Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) a shady operator who puts the band together and then takes every conceivable advantage of its growing success the Runaways finds its most receptive audience in Japan where the groups records and concerts are huge draws. Although the band was a quartet (which also included Lita Ford) the movie focuses primarily on Jett and Currie and their radically different responses to stardom. Stewart nails Jetts physical mannerisms and insouciant attitude and she uses her face and gestures to subtly capture the musicians natural intelligence and wisdom When Fowley barks ""What is our product? Sex Violence Revolt"" Stewart shows you how Jett knows even at her young age not to take this huckster seriously. But The Runaways is really the story of Currie whom Fanning portrays as an ambitious but vulnerable girl torn between her musical dreams and family responsibilities (her twin Marie played by Riley Keough is constantly on her case for not helping look after their bedridden father). Currie lacked the strength and emotional armor to weather the pressures of fame as well as Jett did and The Runaways - which opens with a close-up of Curries menstrual blood as it hits a patch of sun-baked pavement - increasingly sets aside the music to focus on the girls loss of spiritual innocence. Sigismondi gives the film a raw style and beautifully faded cinematography that fit perfectly with its 1970s setting. But The Runaways ultimately feels too lethargic and conventional for the wild story it tells. The movie avoids many of the usual musical biopic cliches but replaces them with an equally tired depiction of an innocent consumed by the wilderness she helped create arriving at a muted lethargic finale that is the antithesis of raucous rock n roll. The Runaways ( out of ) open Friday April 9 in Miami at Sunset Place Aventura and South Beach; in Palm Beach Delray.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Runaways amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Greenberg How to Train Your Dragon >> The Runaways ""Im your Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-Cherry Bomb"" belts Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) the chaotic lead singer of The Runaways. Sorry Britney but in 1975 the 15-year-old rock starlet patented the jailbait double entendre. Still writer-director Floria Sigismondis biopic makes it clear that Cherie didnt invent the teen temptress. The role was thrust upon her by producer/Svengali Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) who wrote her come-ons and dared her to take the act further. He knew a girl group led by a half-naked blonde would sell--he just needed a girl who looked the part and when he spotted the fashion-obsessed Encino hipster he molded her into a tabloid Lolita. (Yes even in the early days of punk looks mattered.) Like Fowley The Runaways puts music second. It rocks attitude and sex drugs abandonment and kisses between Fanning and Kristen Stewarts Joan Jett. Jett anchors the movies first half--she was ready to rock before she could play her guitar and when she straps on that weapon we see a girl determined to blast through any barrier. Theres a tough pulse to this boozy drama which takes a genuine interest--at least for a while--in the friendships and femmepowerment that powered the band (though it makes Scout Taylor-Comptons Lita Ford a whiny crank). Its a feminist piece only in that it says chicks can drink scream and screw as wild as any Rolling Stone. Thirty-five years later their antics are bracing--weve been pacified by Vanessa Hudgens. Sigismondis film is flush with the invulnerability of youth. Moments of it feel fully alive like those last drunken whoops before a post-prom car crash. As Jett Stewart is steely and aloof. She graces us with her cool. But this is Fannings movie and she cranks it up to 11. Fannings not just a brave young actress; shes a brave actress. In every scene of the movie she fights--and wins--her battle for an adult career. Cheries drug addiction swallows up the last half of the movie (as it also did the bands fortunes) and though Sigismondi shunts aside her more interesting themes for a rote plot she cant shape into a credible climax Fanning is a scary sexy force--awesome in every sense of the word.

"The Runaways reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Runaways reviewed. The Runaways reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 19 2010 325 PM Teenage Wasteland Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart in The Runaways. By Dana Stevens Scout Taylor-Compton Dakota Fanning Michael Shannon Alia Shawkat and Kristen Stewart in The Runaways The Runaways (Apparition) directed by Floria Sigismondi draws its primary appeal from precisely the teen exploitation it decries. Theres a certain tawdry B-movie satisfaction in watching the not-yet-legal child star Dakota Fanning--Satsukis voice in My Neighbor Totoro Fern in Charlottes Web--go down the tubes as Cherie Currie the drugged-out and corset-clad lead singer of the 70s girl-punk band the Runaways. But the beats the movie hits are predictable enough that after a rousing raunchy opening act the story of the groups fast rise and spectacular flameout begins to feel like an exceptionally dirty-mouthed after-school special. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Fifteen-year-old Cherie an identical twin from a disintegrating family (her father is a fall-down drunk and her flaky mother played in a cameo by Tatum ONeal follows a boyfriend to Indonesia as the movie begins) finds solace in her record collection. In a powerful early scene she sings along half-audibly to David Bowies ""Lady Grinning Soul"" at a school talent show as her classmates mock her glam getup. Drinking pop at a Sunset Strip disco the blond and angelic Cherie is ""discovered"" by the seedy record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) who tells her she has the right look to front an all-girl band hes putting together. Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) is the guitarist and songwriter; the bands other three members Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton) Sandy West (Stella Maeve) and an unnamed bassist whos actually a composite character (Alia Shawkat) are barely allowed a line apiece. Advertisement In a cramped trailer thats parked in a vacant lot full of garbage Fowley unleashes sadistic coaching (""Come on you filthy pussies lets rock and roll"") to hone the girls aggressively sexual stage presence. Shannon brings his trademark near-unbearable intensity to the role of Kim Fowley--as he mocks and torments the girls hes so awful you want to reach into the screen and throttle him--but the part is written as a pure grotesque; theres no trajectory no back story no character arc. Kristen Stewarts Joan Jett is similarly underwritten but instead of radiating unmitigated nastiness she radiates unmitigated cool. Whether shouting down a square music teacher who tell her ""Girls dont play electric guitar"" or snorting coke in an airplane bathroom or teaching her bandmates how to masturbate while envisioning Farrah Fawcett Joan is at all times the picture of hip rocker detachment (which Stewarts performance translates into mild mumbling disaffection). Only Fannings Cherie is given the chance to change during the movie but the change she undergoes--from virginal rock aspirant to jaded trance-eyed addict--is so familiar from earlier music biopics that it hardly registers as a plot at all. There are some shots--a close-up of Fanning with smeared mascara a shot of an abandoned phone booth emitting a busy signal as the receiver swings back and forth--that belong on a roster of images that should be banned from movies forever. (At least no one knocks a glass off a table signifying the death of another character off-screen.) First-time director Sigismondi who has made music videos for Marilyn Manson Sheryl Crow and the White Stripes excels at capturing the look of the decadent mid-70s an era that seems in retrospect to have been deliberately striving for maximum ugliness. All the high-waisted jeans glitter platform boots and sprayed and feathered hair only make Fanning seem more like a skinny schoolgirl invading the dress-up box. Kristen Stewart looks fabulous in her brunette shag and homemade Sex Pistols T-shirt but the scene where we watch Joan stencil that shirt is one of the movies only glimpses of her creative process. Though Joan reminds Cherie late in the movie that ""I write the songs you just sing them"" the nuts and bolts of composing and recording music--and the pleasure that the girls or at least Joan presumably derived from that act--is surprisingly absent from the film. The Runaways are presented as having sprung so completely from the brain of Kim Fowley that when Joan shows up at the end in her 80s incarnation as lead singer for the Blackhearts we never quite get why she was the one who went on to become a feminist rock icon while Cherie after a brief solo career and years struggling with addiction reinvented herself as a chainsaw artist. The wispy insubstantiality of The Runaways cant be blamed on its cast--Fanning Stewart and Shannon are all good in their roles even if their range is never tested. Ultimately maybe its OK that theres not much below the surface of this great-looking but shallow movie. Its a movie about surfaces about the feeling of being a rock star which Currie--on whose autobiography   Neon Angel the script is based--first craves then ODs on then runs away from in disgust. The Runaways will be a disappointment to those who love rockn roll but a treat for those who love the idea of Kristen Stewart singing ""I Love Rock and Roll"" while jumping up and down on a bed in her underwear.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Mar. 18 2010 526PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Runaways Written and directed by Floria Sigismondi Starring Dakota Fanning Michael Shannon and Kristen Stewart Classification 14A The new rock movie The Runaways is no masterpiece but what do you expect from a film about a 1970s exploitation girl band best-known for the song Cherry Bomb? Yet to her credit Canadian director Floria Sigismondi has created a movie thats more interesting than the band that its about. While serving its commercial purpose as a vehicle for teen stars and Twilight New Moon alumnae Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning The Runaways captures the sleaze and innocence of the era and has some still-relevant things to say about the conflict between girl-rocker empowerment and exploitation. The film opens with a quarter-sized spot of blood hitting a sidewalk. The sidewalk is on Los Angeles Sunset Strip the blood is menstrual - perhaps a nod to Brian De Palmas crypto-feminist horror movie Carrie. Either way its a declaration that this is teenaged girl territory. Early scenes cover the bands beginning in a conventional order. Guitarist Joan Jett (Stewart) who has her costume and bad-ass attitude down better than her guitar chops meets drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) outside a club. Theyre introduced by producer and mad-man Kim Fowley (captured brilliantly by Revolutionary Roads Michael Shannon). Fowley likes the marketing potential of Jetts all-girl rock band and starts putting together the package. Soon he becomes their preposterously self-important guru and sleaze-ball Svengali ""Not womens lib womens libido"" he screams. Fowley puts them through his version of rock n roll boot camp teaching them to scream ""I want an orgasm"" while tossing dog turds and bottles at them to prepare them for hostile audiences. Tenth-grade singer Cherie Currie (Fanning) is selected because of her Brigitte Bardot nymphet looks though shes almost tossed out when she shows up for her audition prepared to sing Peggy Lees Fever. Based on Curries book Neon Angel the film focuses on her troubled family life and how her drug use and increasingly sexualized image causes conflict with the other band members. Stewart who adopts Jetts hunched posture and punk mumble lets her hungry stare do all the work. She wants to be a real rocker not just a star. Fannings Currie by contrast is the baby drama queen a frail narcissist who cant help marketing her nubile sexuality because it gets her the attention she craves. As well as The Runaways captures the dynamic among the three principal characters some elements of the story are disappointingly hazy. What exactly is that lingering kiss between Jett and Currie about? And other band members get only peripheral attention. Lead guitarist Lita Ford who went on to become a sort of hair-metal eighties sex symbol also drops out of the on-screen text epilogue. Sure she was embarrassing. In most ways so were The Runaways - and you cant just run away from the past.

For every Velvet Goldmine theres a Rock Star waiting in the wings. Writer-director Floria Sigismondis The Runaways falls squarely in the missed-opportunity pile. Movie Information The RunawaysRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Floria SigismondiActors Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning Michael Shannon and Scout Taylor-ComptonRun time 105 minutesMPAA rating R (strong language drug use and sexual content all involving teens)Synopsis Kristen Stewart (Joan Jett) and Dakota Fanning (Cherie Currie) star in this biopic of the 70s all-girl teenage rock band.More movies from GuideLive.comSigismondis grungy stylish biopic charts the swift rise and decline of teen rock sensations the Runaways a ragtag band of no-nonsense girls that hung together for four years and in the original lineup released just two albums. Like so many influential acts from the 70s the Runaways length of existence does not reconcile with their level of influence. Their proto-pop-metal sound can still be heard in modern bands like the Donnas.Assembled by bipolar Svengali Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon easily the films most vibrant asset) the Runaways - rugged Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart); rebellious guitarist Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton); laid-back drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve); and lead singer Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) - wrestle with coming of age amid the hedonistic excess of LAs rock scene.Although Sigismondi does a fine job capturing the debauched scuzziness of the Runaways brief existence too much of the film feels like an expensive music video (Sigismondi hails from the world of MTV). Toss in a bit of sexual experimentation along with an opportunity to watch Fanning snort cocaine in an airplane lavatory and its hard not to sprint for the shower as the credits roll.The bands few hits like ""Cherry Bomb"" and ""Queens of Noise"" are all over the soundtrack but the music much like the people who made it feels like an afterthought. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"The Runaways Homage to queens of noise really rocks | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Runaways Homage to queens of noise really rocksIn the pantheon of serious (read snobbish) rock criticism the Runaways ranked just below the Monkees and just above the Banana Splits.Dakota Fanning left and Kristen Stewart right star in The Runaways.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 19 2010 Starring Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning and Michael Shannon. Written and directed by Floria Sigismondi. At major theatres. 14A In the pantheon of serious (read snobbish) rock criticism the Runaways ranked just below the Monkees and just above the Banana Splits.This is to say these 1970s L.A. teen screamers werent taken very seriously at all. Article Continued BelowThey have yet to be inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame (although ABBA made the cut this year) and its taken 31 years since their last power chord sounded for the band members to rate their own major motion picture.But The Runaways written and directed by Torontos Floria Sigismondi makes a compelling argument about overlooked talent and under-appreciated influence (Bangles Bikini Kill etc.). The movie also ahem rocks.It reveals alchemy that continues today the transformative power of three chords and an attitude not only made serious jam-kickers out of Runaways frontwomen Cherie Currie and Joan Jett it also worked wonders on Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart who play them in the movie.Its something of a shock to see sweet lil Dakota rocking the mic as the face-painted and corset-clad lead vocalist Currie and also following her well-documented (if also cliched) descent into sex drugs and rock-induced despair. Stewart applies her vampiric moodiness to rhythm guitarist Jetts tough-girl persona.She evokes the deceptive angel-face of Elvis 56 while simultaneously summoning the leather-wrapped sneer of a Keith Richards or Sid Vicious.Sigismondi bases her screenplay on Curries tell-all tome Neon Angel The Cherie Currie Story which inevitably and regrettably leads The Runaways into family melodrama about Curries drunken dad and jealous twin sister.Before that though its a highly entertaining lesson in Rock Godhood 101 as the nascent Runaways get put through the ropes by their producer-cum-svengali Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon gloriously showboating) who reckons hes found the equivalent of Charlies golden ticket with his jailbait jukebox shakers.Sure there were female rockers before the Runaways - Janis Joplin Grace Slick and Jetts idol Suzi Quatro come readily to mind - but they all had male musicians providing the heavily artillery. Fowleys plan was to make punks out of these princesses teaching them not only the essential three chords but also how to dodge beer cans hurled by sexist knuckleheads (which makes for one of the films most entertaining scenes).""Men dont want to see women anywhere unless its in a kitchen or on their knees"" he thunders to his charges overstating the general male attitude of the 1970s but getting the main point across nonetheless.Multi-media artist Sigismondi displays a fine sense of time and place and an eye for the telling detail in her feature filmmaking debut which begins with the roadside SPLAT of 15-year-old Curries first drop of menstrual blood. The parallel stories of Bowie-obsessed suburban dreamer Currie and hard-edged loner Jett converge into the pumps-to-platforms rise of the Runaways from house-party novelty act into stadium shakers and radio hitmakers (""Cherry Bomb"") culminating in a riotous 1977 tour of Japan that came very near the bands explosive end.Its curious how little attention Sigismondi pays to the other members of the band particularly Sandy West the drummer and co-founder and Lita Ford lead guitarist. There is also nothing but an end-note credit about Jetts post-Runaways success as leader of Joan Jett amp; the Blackhearts a group arguably more deserving of rock hall honours and its own movie (with Stewart once again playing Jett hopefully). But Fanning and Stewart are the deserving stars of the film nailing every last look and lick holding their own even as Shannon savvily attempts to nick every scene. And as Sigismondi and Jett have been quick to point out The Runaways isnt a band biopic its a story about the corrosive allure of rock n roll that also happens to tell part of the story of an influential female rock band.

"Review The Runaways rocks on - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview The Runaways rocks onBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 03/19/2010 120000 AM PDT More movie news reviews <a href=""http//scripts.bayareanewsgroup.com/scripts/feed2js/feed2js.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.contracostatimes.com%2Fmngi%2Frss%2FCustomRssServlet%2F571%2F201110.xmlamp;num=10amp;del=yamp;rel=yamp;html=y"">View RSS feed</a> In the mid-1970s the world of sex drugs and rock n roll belonged to men. And then along came the Runaways five teenage girls drawn from rock clubs on the Sunset Strip.Originally dismissed as a manufactured band -- Creem magazine once dissed them as the Monkees with breasts (except it didnt use that nice a word) -- the Runaways proved to be much more than that. Particularly in concert they were one hard-edged take-no-prisoners rock band that could hold its own with other up-and-coming bands of the day like the Ramones and Cheap Trick (both bands once opened for the Runaways). The first (and only) time I ever saw them in early 1977 they snarled and pounded their way through a late night set at a club called the Bayou in Washington D.C. rocking so hard that they set off a near-riot.But less than four years after the band came together the Runaways flamed out leaving behind just five albums. Still that was enough for the band to achieve an iconic stature that influenced and energized countless women rockers.Now in her feature film debut director Floria Sigismondi -- best known for her music videos with the likes of David Bowie -- has attempted to capture not just the rise and fall of the Runaways but also the milieu of 1970s rock. She doesnt completely succeed but she comes awfully close and ""The Runaways"" (which opens today) is a true rock n roll film messy and sometimes flawed but infused with raw energy spirit and authenticity.Advertisement Sigismondi -- who also wrote the script -- is helped immeasurably by the two commanding performances that make up the movies core. Dakota Fanning long Hollywoods leading child star hurls herself into the role of Cherie Currie the bands jailbait lead singer whose overt sexuality and provocative outfits predated Madonna by a decade or more. It is a stunning transition from the innocence of most of Fannings roles and the actress pulls it off without hitting a false note as Currie deals with an alcoholic father a neglectful mother drugs and the ravages of fame.Complementing Fanning is Kristen Stewart who proves once again that she is going to have a fine acting career long after she stops playing Bella Swan in the ""Twilight Saga."" As guitarist-songwriter-vocalist Joan Jett who would go on to solo fame fronting the Blackhearts and with rock anthem ""I Love Rock N Roll"" Stewart is positively fierce. Her role isnt as showy as Fannings but Stewart gives Jett the kind of emotional weight and sheer joy of rock that the film needs.Together they carry a film that includes heavy drug use raw language and a steamy sex scene played out to Iggy Pops ""I Want to Be Your Dog"" that is a long way from ""The Cat In the Hat"" and ""Twilight.""Based on Curries memoir ""Neon Angel"" the movie races through the Runaways career so quickly that it seems as if it all happened in a week. That is the biggest flaw in Sigismondis work since the sheer pace of the film doesnt allow for enough character development. The Currie story told here is a simplistic one that doesnt delve deeply enough into a complex young woman. There is also little time spent on the abuse the Runaways faced abuse that fills both Curries book and the 2004 documentary ""Edgeplay"" by former Runaways bass player Victory Tischler-Blue.And the rest of the Runaways are reduced to bit players in their own story -- most notably the late drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) and lead guitarist Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton) who would go on to be the queen of the heavy-metal shredders.Still ""The Runaways"" gets it right most of the time from the dingy dressing rooms in low-rent rock clubs to the scenes involving Kim Fowley the veteran record producer who was the groups Svengali. (Michael Shannon an Oscar nominee for ""Revolutionary Road"" gives a wicked performance as the flamboyant Fowley and his verbal confrontations with Fanning and Stewart are spot-on rock throwdowns.)The concert scenes are thoroughly convincing with Fanning and Stewart doing their own vocals. When they launch into ""Cherry Bomb"" the bands first hit in one scene it is an astonishing replication of the power of rock n roll.It may be as Fowley says near the end of the film that the Runaways ""were a conceptual rock project that failed."" But as a film about a certain time and place in rock history ""The Runaways"" largely succeeds.""The Runaways""1/2Rating R (for language sexual content and drug use)Cast Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning Michael Shannon Alia Shawkat Stella Maeve and Scout Taylor-ComptonDirector-writer Floria SigismondiRunning time 1 hour 42 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

""The Runaways"" features a ""Twilight"" star breaking free of kid roles and showing her wild side -- but its Dakota Fanning not Kristen Stewart. Stewart plays a very serious teenage Joan Jett who joins an all-girl rock band in 1975 LA with the aid of an imp/impresario (a very funny Michael Shannon who is so brilliant the director gives him about five scenes in which he essentially says the same things). He spots a 15-year-old blonde (Dakota Fanning) in a club tells her he likes her Bowie/Bardot look and her readiness to ""kick the s - - t out of a truck driver"" and decides hes found the lead singer of the Runaways. ""The Runaways"" an entertaining but routine rock flick chronicles the corruption rise and fall of Cherie Currie (Fanning) though she didnt rise very high (number of US hits the band recorded zero) and didnt fall particularly hard. Indeed shes still alive -- ""working as a chainsaw artist in the San Fernando Valley."" PHOTOS BEST ROCK N ROLL MOVIES PHOTOS THE RUNAWAYS NYC PREMIERE VIDEO THE RUNAWAYS NYC PREMIERE There should have been more of that wit (which appears in a postscript) in the movie which begins with a charming shot of menstrual blood splatting on a sidewalk. The film then strenuously assures us that its liberating for girl rockers to urinate on rivals guitars have sex with each other (though the Stewart-Fanning love scene is a bit tame) annoy their families growl and generally get strung out. Currie eventually wobbles through a Cobain-level haze of addiction alienation and ennui. Yay girls Theres a combustible energy to the first half in which Shannons glam producer-manager Kim Fowley keeps telling the bland suburbanites in the band to be skankier messier angrier (in motivational speeches he tells them to think ""I hate the f - - - in world My fathers a faggot . . . I want an orgasm""). Both Shannon and Fanning who gets to ride an arc from shy to slutty are gold. In the downer second half a drugged-out Currie struts around in a bustier thigh-highs and a garter belt while Jett takes on the thankless role of the responsible professional who is forever lecturing her friend about her bad habits. The band doesnt burn itself up on its own genius so much as fall apart like a ball of lint. Watching the girls argue about their media coverage is particularly dreary. No great loss. Among bands assembled on the basis of their head shots Ill take the Monkees -- and maybe even the Spice Girls -- over the Runaways who could not figure out how to make songs out of attitude and riffing. Amusing though it sometimes is the closest thing the movie offers to a reason for its existence is the post-Runaways success of Jett. How nostalgic can you be for a band that never made it? For me the big face-smack of disappeared time came during a scene in which Jett takes a guitar lesson from a lame fogey. Look closely The teacher is the guy who played Mike Damone in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""

"The Runaways movie review Rock n roll retread |       NJ.com comments The Runaways movie review Rock n roll retread Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 19 2010 at 456 AM View/Post Comments Dakota Fanning left Kristen Stewart right and Michael Shannon center star in ""The Runaways"" a film based on the experiences of the 1970s girl group and their eccentic manager.""The Runaways"" is the story of the punkish teen-girl band of the 70s a high-concept low-trash group that took one dirty concept -- ""jailbait rock"" -- and a couple of singles and had a career. Well okay good for them. And good for Joan Jett who somehow staggered out of that eventual train wreck and forged a life for herself as a solo artist with her own hits (and record label). ""I Love Rock n Roll""? She should. But why should anyone watch this movie? And why would its stars make it except to try to shake off their teen-idol images? The Runaways (R) Apparition (105 min.) Directed by Floria Sigismondi. With Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning. Michael Shannon. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Two and a half stars Ratings note The film contains sexual situations underage drinking substance abuse and strong language. As Jett Kristen Stewart has found another part that lets her use her tough-but-tender sullenness -- and lets her shock ""Twilight"" fans by playing a foul-mouthed pill-popping lesbian. Once they get over their surprise though they may have to calm down the Dakota Fanning fans. Shes here too playing the bands druggie singer Cherie Currie as a passive/hysterical hyper-sexed mess. The very first shot in the film in fact is the graphic close-up start to a menstrual sequence. Lovely. Its all pretty dramatic and deliberately offensive in a punk-rock kind of way. The problem though is that the Runaways themselves werent really that dramatic and offensive -- or even influential. Jett wasnt the first girl to pick up a guitar. The same time the Runaways were putting out their albums Nancy Wilson was leading Heart; the Slits were smashing their way through British punk. And if you want to talk about sexually liberated female singers -- well forget about Currie for a moment and go back to Janis Joplin. Or Grace Slick. Or better yet all the way back to Bessie Smith. No the Runaways were a product -- and the truly interesting thing about them is the man who did the packaging. That was manager/manipulator/exploiter Kim Fowley. A wild eccentric he put the band together like a puzzle -- a bit of blonde there some tough brunette there -- and played the press beautifully. And hes played beautifully here by Michael Shannon an actor who is skilled at playing intense and unsettled men. (He was the mad next-door neighbor in ""Revolutionary Road."") Eyes wide veins popping hes both Dr. Frankenstein and his creation. Shannon is incredibly fun to watch. (Although unless he wants to become the Dwight Frye of the 21st century its time to branch out -- hes played too many of these parts recently.) And the music can be great -- although the greatest tunes here come from other groups. But once Shannon lurches off-screen were left with five teenagers most of whom are only sketched out. (The lively Alia Shawkat who plays a fictionalized bassist barely gets a line.) Youre left yearning for Shannons return. And when the most interesting character in a rock n roll movie is the manager thats not a good sign. Stewart the best of the rest tries hard here. Fanning briefly comes to life during one concert scene. But too much of this is as heavily calculated as a three-minute single -- they play music they make out they take drugs they break up. Weve heard this song before. And no matter how many tricks director Floria Sigismondi pulls out -- blurred photography extreme closeups strange angles -- ""The Runaways"" remains strictly a cover version.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Runaways   out of four Stars Dakota Fanning Kristen Stewart Michael Shannon Alia Shawkat Tatum ONealDirectorFloria SigismondiDistributor Overture FilmsRating R for language drug use and sexual content all involving teens.Running time 1 hour 42 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Runaways is anything but a straight-ahead biopic. Its an artistic and authentic evocation of an era but a rather surface-skimming story of the 70s all-girl rock band fronted by Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. If anything it just makes you want to know more about Jetts back story and Curries subsequent life. TRAILER Grab a peek at The Runaways MORE Runaways poised to give girls an education The film is anchored by a trio of strong performances Dakota Fannings Cherie Currie Kristen Stewarts Joan Jett and Michael Shannons megalomaniacal and sadistic music producer Kim Fowley. Overall The Runaways is more arty than eye-opening. Time and place are potently depicted down to the glittery eye shadow Farrah Fawcett dos and stacked platform heels. The mood captures the glitter rock and burgeoning punk scene in Los Angeles. Its hard to assess how closely the film adheres to what really went down when this band of disenfranchised teenage girls shot to fame. Did they really write their hit Cherry Bomb on their first rehearsal together with Fowley leeringly improvising lyrics? Shannon (Revolutionary Road) appears to relish the role of a crude rock impresario who essentially manufactured the bands image of rowdy sexuality. He molded the wide-eyed Currie into a kind of rockin Brigitte Bardot. In a twisted spin on sisterhood he urges the girls to think like male rock n rollers -- he puts it more crassly urging them to think with a masculine body part -- and exploit their jailbait-style femininity. He persuaded the Runaways to strut and titillate; the music was secondary. Filmgoers who have watched Fannings childhood performances over the years might be taken aback watching the 16-year-old play such a sexualized druggy character. Cherie quickly segues from sassy-sweet to dissolute and foul-mouthed. Fanning nails her vulnerability trajectory and downward spiral. Because the film is based on Curries memoir its not surprising that she was front and center in the movie. We learn about her turbulent family life but we dont get any idea where Jett sprang from or what motivated her to convey her love for rock n roll as she did. Stewarts trademark low-key surliness works well for the part. She projects a convincing blend of swagger and smarts. We learn during the concluding crawl that Jett continues performing as a musician while Currie does not. Shes described as ""a chain saw artist"" who lives in the San Fernando Valley. We can draw inferences about who loved rock n roll most but it would have been nice if the film had filled in some of the blanks.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Runaways Drama. Starring Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart. Directed by Floria Sigismundi. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The strength and beauty of ""The Runaways"" are that it tells the truth. It doesnt always tell the literal truth about the pioneering all-girl rock band the Runaways though it gets the basic facts and most of the details right. More crucially it conveys precisely what it was like to be young in the mid-1970s a peculiar juncture in American social history. Back then there was an almost post-apocalyptic feeling in the air that all norms had been tossed aside that nothing mattered that the whole country and the world had spun out of control. Other films have attempted to convey this. Ang Lees ""The Ice Storm"" got a piece of this feeling but it couldnt get all of it. Its failure was that it was in a sense too good a movie too artful. ""The Runaways"" by contrast is precisely the kind of gritty seamy and occasionally awkward picture that the 1970s deserve. And in getting that one thing right - in capturing that strange combination of despair and frustrated energy - it gets everything right. It explains why kids needed rock n roll and why the Runaways still mean so much to those who remember them. Based on ""Neon Angel"" the memoir of lead singer Cherie Currie ""The Runaways"" tells the story of the creation of the band focusing mainly on Joan Jett who became the groups rhythm guitarist and principal songwriter and Currie who was discovered by Jett and producer Kim Fowley at Los Angeles nightclub when she was 15. They liked her look (""a little Bowie a little Bardot"") and had no idea whether she could sing. She could.

The world is alive with promise and excitement but you cant get to it. You have no power. But music gives the feeling of power the illusion of it and sometimes thats enough to keep you sane. Currie (Dakota Fanning) and Jett (Kristen Stewart) start off as rock-obsessed high school misfits Currie with a falling-apart family and an obsession with David Bowie and Jett with her leather gear and a dream of becoming a female rocker - of a variety that did not yet exist. ""The Runaways"" shows how rock n roll can save your life and almost wreck it. Jett done perfectly The soundtrack includes artists that influenced the Runaways (such as Suzi Quatro) original Runaways recordings and live re-creations of Runaways songs with Fanning singing lead vocals. It all sounds terrific though it must be said that Fanning isnt half the singer Currie was. Where Fanning excels is in suggesting the misery and confusion under the assumed air of teenage cool and the gradual loss of herself to all the pressures and the drugs. She becomes the prime whipping girl for Fowley ably played by Michael Shannon as an almost demonic presence part sadistic idiot part rock n roll seer. Stewart known mainly for mumbling and stumbling through the ""Twilight"" movies is the revelation here. She has made a meticulous study of Jett - of her posture her manner her expressions even in the way thoughts cross her eyes. And she has Jetts stage manner down the way this seemingly shy person assumes total authority when she gets up to play. The visuals help - the costuming and art direction are spot-on. Unlikely pair At the heart of ""The Runaways"" is Fanning and Stewart and their portrait of an unlikely friendship between two very different teenage girls - a friendship that for a time becomes very close indeed. Its also a showbiz story of one girl who just didnt want success bad enough and another who recognized her chance and clung to it like a lifeline. Some will complain understandably that ""The Runaways"" ultimately tells a downbeat story that drifts and fades into a diminuendo. It feels ungainly as though something else - something big - should be happening. But no the filmmaker knew exactly what she was doing It just wouldnt be the 70s if it didnt leave audiences with a cocaine hangover.

"The Runaways - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW The RunawaysThe biopic about the 70s punk girl group spends too much time with the wrong character.March 19 2010|By BETSY SHARKEY | Film Critic The problem with ""The Runaways"" a street-level snapshot of the creation of the groundbreaking 70s all-girl rock band is that they went with the wrong girl. Instead of training the lens on the Runaways artistic rebel who hung around and became legend rocker Joan Jett played with serious punk grrl power by Kristen Stewart the movie focuses on the one who actually ran away lead singer Cherie Currie a kohl-eyed and sullen Dakota Fanning.The look is there. Writer-director Floria Sigismondi who cut her teeth in the music video world and is making her feature debut used her shoestring indie budget to great effect creating a grainy documentary feel that nails the hard knocks and raw existence of the I-wannabe-a-rock-star crowd hovering around the edges of the Hollywood music scene. Its with the story that she stumbles. Based on Curries book ""Neon Angel The Cherie Currie Story"" the film stays too narrowly focused on the Valley blond recruited for her golden locks and hot bod as much as her pipes. But her flirtation with fame or the hints of a life-scarring descent into drugs never come close to the pathos passion and edgy creativity of Jett whose post-Runaways fist-pumping mantra ""I Love Rock N Roll"" in 1982 captured the stadium rock zeitgeist of the day.The good news is that Stewart is absolutely spot on as Jett; fighting convention in studded leather jackets favored by biker bad boys and shredding an electric guitar when folk rock or sugary pop was more the fashion for femmes. It was a smart choice for Stewart who was in danger of having her career eclipsed by Bella the pale troubled teen she plays in the ""Twilight"" series a role that made her a star without confirming she could act.Fanning unfortunately is absolutely wrong as Cherie. Fifteen when the film was being shot in a bustier and fishnets and heavy makeup she looks like an innocent lured off Hollywood Boulevard for child porn not the growling sex machine that -- at least on stage -- Currie was. ""The Secret Life of Bees"" actress has been working pretty much full time since she was 6 with a string of impressive performances. In recent years she has been turning to indie projects to make the transition to edgier adult roles including as a rape victim in the provocative but panned ""Hounddog"" in 2007. But she has yet to find the right platform and with Cherie she never finds her footing.""The Runaways"" begins in the mid-70s. Joan corners the flamboyantly preening rock guru of the time Kim Fowley played with a delicious twisted perverseness by Michael Shannon (""Revolutionary Roads"" unstable mathematician) outside a club one night and persuades him to handle her band which at the moment consists of Joan her guitar and a vague idea. That launches the movie into a glorified making-of-the-band saga told in quick cuts with a lot of drums. But they still need that cherry on top of a lead singer. Whether its fate or karma Joan and Kim spot the Bardot blond in a club one night and when it turns out her real name is Cherie well the rest as they say is rock n roll history.Curries experience up to her Runaways audition was a disastrous Bowie lip sync for a high school talent contest and that becomes the device to fill in her nothing-special surburban back story -- divorced parents drunk dad mom taking off with a new beau.More interesting is when the attention moves back to Joan and one of the bands defining moments. In the trashed-out trailer that serves as rehearsal space Joan and Kim improvise ""Cherry Bomb"" the song that would carry the group to fame.Shannon infuses manic life and libido into the crazy controlling genius in caftans and in the process makes real the ego-destroying realities and unforgiving odds of making it as a band.But every time things get interesting like the Jett-Currie relationship the filmmaker pulls back. So while their chemistry on stage eventually moves into the bedroom any real sense that something more than casual sex passed between them is left untouched which makes the breakup when it comes less powerful than it should have been.Instead as so often happens in music-based biopics the filmmaker hangs the movie on a song. ""Cherry Bomb"" is the central through line and the only real character arc for Fanning. But what should grow sexier darker and more cynical with each performance and there are many only succeeds in getting louder its ""Hello daddy hello mom Im your ch-ch-ch-ch ch-ch-ch-ch cherry bomb"" chorus destined to linger in memory far longer than the movie.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESQueens of Noise takes the Runaways seriouslyJuly 12 2013An ex-Runaway makes a returnJune 16 2012The Runawaysa look The eyes had itMarch 14 2010For Kristen Stewart this is her dawnJanuary 28 2010Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning get wild with The RunawaysJanuary 17 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentKristen StewartCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-runaways19-2010mar19,0,5152199.story",200,therunaways21,therunaways,latimes

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> That trash talk is aimed at Kristen Stewart 19 and Dakota Fanning 16 stars of Twilight New Moon by Michael Shannon in fierce flamboyant form as evil-genius manager Kim Fowley. Kim is cursing the girls as members of the Runaways a pioneering band of five jailbait rockers from broken homes that he wants to turn into the female Beatles. Stewart gives as good as she gets. Shes playing Joan Jett 15 the shag-haired guitarist singer and songwriter who co-founded the Runaways in 1975 and went on - after the L.A. band dissolved in 1979 - to achieve star status as a solo act. Fanning has it tougher as Cherie Currie 15 a blond Valley girl molded by Kim into the bands lead singer and jerk-off fantasy. Cherie is so naive she almost breaks down. In a killer scene early in the film written and directed by -- music-video whiz Floria Sigismondi Kim preps the girls for life in a mans game. Rehearsing in a crummy trailer the girls are hit by bottles cans dirt and dog shit tossed by Kim and his toadies. Cherie is told to sell the sexual heat in a song Kim and Joan create for her ""Hello Daddy hello Mom Im your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb."" The ""Cherry Bomb"" scene is a raunchy blast of rock history. And Fanning and Stewart who do their own singing seize the moment. As Kim tells Cherie the dirty secrets of rock ""Fuck you fuck authority I want an orgasm"" she shows him what a wild child can be. Fanning scores a knockout. And Shannon as the ""Frankenstein motherfucker"" is a fireball of potent perversity. Sadly The Runaways fades into dull predictability. Joan must wait for Cherie to screw up on drugs and sex (the make-out session between Stewart and Fanning is delicate to a fault) so she can step in and front the band. Stewart is just getting rolling when the movie ends. But face it The Runaways is based on Neon Angel Curries 1989 memoir. Shes the only one who gets a backstory. The result is a walk on the wimp side. Guitarist Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton) and drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) barely register in their own band. And Alia Shawkat shows up as an amalgam of Runaways bassists. Jett served as a producer but the script never shows what drives her. Whats left are colorful scenes of life on the road especially in Japan where the girls hit it big with a live album. But theres no sense of rock anarchy. Say what you will about the Runaways -- they never played it safe. The movie does. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

""A little bit Bardot a little bit Bowie."" The time 1975. The place Rodney Bingenheimers English Disco where glam-rockers and glitter groupies converged and frequently conjoined on L.A.s Sunset Strip.The scenemaker? Kim Fowley the bombastic music producer who in 1975 was known if at all for having produced novelty songs like 1960s ""Alley Oop."" The jailbait? Cherie Currie whom Fowley introduces to would-be rocker Joan Jett before casting both (alongside three other L.A. chiclets) as the girl group the Runaways.But it was Currie the blond vocalist in the white satin corset and Jett the raven-haired guitarist in black leather who defined the groups look sound and pansexual appeal when they exploded on the music scene with their hit ""Cherry Bomb."" Packaged by Fowley as a novelty act - hot underage girls with guitars - these teenagers in heat were not ""about womens lib"" as the best line in Floria Sigismondis The Runaways has it. They were ""about womens libido.""Sigismondis evocative portrait of Currie (Dakota Fanning) Jett (Kristen Stewart) and their stage sisters is a strange bird. On the one hand its a pitch-perfect evocation of time and place and boasts mesmerizing performances including that of a tranced-out Fanning a prickly Stewart and an outlandish Michael Shannon as Fowley.On the other it adheres slavishly to the too-much too-soon template of nearly every other music biopic. In this case theres something awfully literal about watching the group famous for the refrain ""Neon angels on the road to ruin"" as just that. And not much more.Sigismondi the Italo-Canadian director of music videos for Marilyn Manson and the White Stripes has a confident grasp on the films atmospheric look. Shes sympathetic to these heroines who reversed the dynamic of rock as something boys did and girls watched.And she has a remarkably nuanced perspective on these young women who in exchange for self-expression and emancipation submitted to a little old-fashioned exploitation. As Sigismondi frames it Currie is the white angel and Jett the black one gyrating in the gray zone between teenager and adult. So what if they are purveying their wares if it allows them to pursue their pleasures?It is possible after all to advocate girl power and also wish that Fanning 15 didnt serve herself up as a piping-hot strumpet.(Although the sex shown in this R-rated feature is soft-core its explicit language is hard-core. An instructional soliloquy about using the 1976 Farrah Fawcett-Majors posteras a sexual aid is hilarious but so detailed that I wouldnt want my 13-year-old who worships Stewart as the erotic but chaste Bella in the Twilight movies to see this until she was 30.)I liked The Runaways in passages but not on the whole. Despite Sigismondis fresh eye feminist perspective and rapport with actors The Runaways feels like a long-form music video recycling every trope from the doomed-rocker handbook.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Late in The Runaways Michael Shannons cold-blooded Svengali Kim Fowley dismisses the seminal 70s all-girl punk band of the title as nothing more than a failed conceptual project. Those are the bitter words of a star-maker cavalierly tossed aside by his own creation but theres an element of truth to them as well. Like the Sex Pistols The Runaways combined raw punk anarchy and cynical commercial calculation. They were prefabricated yet authentic the product of estrogen-fueled rage and a sleazy music-industry lifer intent on exploiting ripe teenage sexuality. There is a fascinating film to be made about Fowleys slick commoditization of adolescent rebellion but in her numbingly familiar feature-length debut writer-director Floria Sigismondi apparently isnt interested in Fowley so much as she is in giving rock n roll movie conventions a distaff spin. A disturbingly precocious scantily clad Dakota Fanning stars as Cherie Currie a spooky David Bowie super-fan who more or less stumbles into a gig as the Runaways lead singer. The dead-eyed talent vacuum that is Kristen Stewart co-stars as Joan Jett a snarling badass whose tomboy attitude and songwriting perfectly complemented Curries purring sex kitten onstage on record and in bed. Yes The Runaways is as filled with softcore underage lesbian sex as it is with rock-movie cliches from the montage of rapid-fire ecstatic magazine and newspaper covers that take the group from obscurity to superstardom (in Japan at least where the locals have a weakness for young girls in tight pants) to the use of blurry distorted visuals to convey Curries ever-deteriorating mental state during the proverbial nightmare descent into booze and pills. Shannon plays Fowley as the P.T. Barnum of the Sunset Strip a prankish provocateur whose tough love for his proteges looks an awful lot like emotional and verbal abuse. Shannon gives the film an unpredictable live-wire energy but as it staggers into its third act Shannon more or less disappears from the proceedings and the film focuses intently on Currie (whose memoir inspired the film) and Jett (who executive-produced). The Runaways were the first major all-girl punk band. In honor of this distinction theyre now the first major all-girl punk band to inspire a bleary excessive and altogether mediocre big-screen biography.

Comments (1) click to enlarge The Runaways Recommended Free Video Rated R  100 minutes  2010 Directed by Floria Sigismondi this biopic about the pioneering girl-rock band is loaded with cliches--the raw beginnings the rise to fame the flameout as the members fall prey to drugs celebrity and egomania. But it also wades into the tangled gender politics surrounding the band which assaulted the rock establishment with a sexuality as bold as any mans but was entirely manufactured by a cynical male manager named Kim Fowley. Onscreen this contradiction is heightened by the fact that Michael Shannon (Revolutionary Road) steals his every scene as the aphorism-spouting Fowley while Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning often fade into the 70s wallpaper as guitarist Joan Jett and front woman Cherie Currie. Making her feature debut Sigismondi conjures up a cheapo New World Pictures vibe thats utterly persuasive; the script is adapted from Curries autobiography which explains the extraneous story line about her unhappy home life.

""Hello Daddy Hello Mom"" she sings. Then twitching her shoulders back and forth in sexy machine-gun time to the music she snarls ""Im your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb"" Shes not a great singer but what a stance a tude an image In the mid- to late 70s the Runaways a packaged group of choppy-haired teen-glam feline punkettes from L.A. ? did for girls playing power chords what the Sex Pistols did for beer-spewing anarchy. Not that they were very popular. (They were huge in Japan?and thats about it.) If anything the Runaways seem cooler now than they did then; its only in hindsight that they come off as fearless trailblazers rather than as a novelty act. The most entertaining thing about The Runaways a highly watchable if mostly run-of-the-mill group biopic is that its writer-director Floria Sigismondi has a sixth sense for how the Runaways were bad-angel icons first and a rock amp; roll band second. Early on we see Kristen Stewart as the black-shag-haired Joan Jett in an L.A. boutique where she has to coerce the saleswoman ? into selling her a mans studded biker jacket. Stewarts casually likable no-frills performance starts with Jetts tough-girl saunter -- which is to say the actress knows just how to walk like a skinny dude. At the same time we meet Cherie (pronounced Sher-ee) who cuts her platinum hair into a David Bowie shag so that she can lip-synch to him at a high school talent contest. These girls have their outlaw fashion bona fides down. But it takes Kim Fowley the L.A. record producer who becomes their shrewd hectoring Svengali to teach them how to rock out like boys. Fowley who favors red leather jackets and dog collars the size of tiaras is a hyped-up hustler-manipulator who has seen through the rebel artifice of rock amp; roll yet loves it anyway. As played by Michael Shannon the great actor from Revolutionary Road he looks like a punk Frankenstein and shouts everything as if in mid-tantrum. Hes a creep and proud of it but he knows what sells. He places Cherie in the band based on her looks alone as if he were casting a porno film. That shes only 15 is just icing on the bad-girl cake. Theres a fun scene set in a grungy rehearsal trailer where Fowley with a little help from Joan makes up ""Cherry Bomb"" on the spot and teaches Cherie to sing it with nasty glee. You can see the girls co-opting the male hormonal thrust of rock and making it their own. When it gets away from the stage though and from the iconography of strutting she-devil-in-lingerie empowerment The Runaways is a glumly episodic rock saga. It stays true to how the bands members were exploited yet theres a special challenge in bringing this story to life since the Runaways were really just little girls who fed themselves into a buzz-saw machine of record-industry hype. They were passive vessels in their own story and the film makes them even more passive As portrayed theyre so generically brash that they dont have full-scale personalities. Stewart nails Jetts sinewy swagger but Joans lesbian proclivities are treated in a teasing music-video way. I mean why be so coy in a film thats meant to be a rowdy salute to a new kind of audacious feminine sexual power? But then Joan is really the side player here. The Runaways is fashioned as Cherie Curries story -- and the bite-size conflicts provided for her while true to the facts arent enough to give the film a dramatic center. She squabbles tiresomely with her twin sister (Riley Keough). And when Fowley forces her to do a solo cheesecake shoot Joan chews her out for selling out the bands image. (Does Joan realize what the band is selling?) The film shows that the Runaways were authentic -- if packaged -- stars who were out of their depths because they were ahead of their time. As a band they get their due but as individuals the movie seldom makes them more than victims.

The Runaways Fair to good Director Floria Sigismondi. Cast Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning Michael Shannon. Rating R for language drug use and sex all involving teens. RELATED Kristen Stewart Rocking out with The Runaways Movies that rock Spotlight Dakota Fanning Movies about musicians Historical figures in film That may not be the most polite way to describe members of the band fronted by Joan Jett and Cherie Currie played in Floria Sigismondis film by Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning respectively. But its a word tossed around a lot by the brilliant (in a demented sort of way) manager of the group Kim Fowley played with scene-stealing gusto by Michael Shannon. And why wouldnt it be? He put the band together with that in mind. Jett Currie and Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton) were indeed kids when the band started and were kids by the time it broke up though they did a lot of growing up in the meanwhile most of it of the sordid rock-star variety. With the exception of gender its the standard story really Kids from broken homes dont fit in but find their purpose in rock and roll. Its the ultimate method of outsider inclusion; plug in and play and youre finally a part of something even if its something that exists outside most peoples experience. The young Jett just wants to rock but shes told at every turn a variation on the same thing (and told outright by her music teacher) Girls dont play electric guitar. But Jett does and when she spots Fowley decked out in eyeliner and a dog collar at a nightclub she tells him so. Sensing a kindred spirit Fowley gets Jett together with other musicians. But they need a singer preferably blond and willing to get wild onstage. If shes wearing lingerie when that happens well so much the better. Singing talent is optional. Enter Currie a David Bowie disciple whom Jett and Fowley spot at a club. With the proper prompting which consists mostly of being browbeaten and humiliated by Fowley Currie learns to front a band to spit out lyrics to songs like ""Cherry Bomb"" that make her seem way beyond the teenager she really is. There are soft-focus allusions (sometimes literally so) to ambiguous sexuality more-explicit takes on drug use and a generally dissolute lifestyle. Its no surprise that this is not exactly a good way to grow up. Tensions mount within the band. Jett and Currie form a sort of alliance but Currie is eventually too lost in her own problems to keep the band going. Stewart is surprisingly good as Jett; the head-down non-responsive attitude that is so annoying in the ""Twilight"" films is much more at home here. Jett is lost after all until she cranks up her guitar at which point Stewart comes alive as well. And Fanning famous as a child star is all grown up as Currie - or at least as grown up as Currie was allowed to be. Whats lacking are surprises or any sort of different take on the traditional rags-to-rock-riches story. The performances help make up for that - Shannon is an absolute scream (who is often screaming). Even better the songs hold up particularly well. Jett would go on to a massively successful career with more of a pop-rock sound. The Runaways were more raw more primal. The Runaways broke new ground. And if ""The Runaways"" doesnt its still a movie worth watching - and listening to. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

As long as there is music to be cranked up on the stereo so will it always be an alluring fantasy for angsty teens (and grown-up ones) to imagine themselves as strutting spitting shit-kicking frontmen; muppety drummers; or thrashing guitar heroes. Lets face it the success of Rock Band didnt just come from nowhere. But as previous biopics and VH-1s Behind the Music specials have told us time and time again theres a familiar arc to these things young scrappy upstarts try to make good find success get poisoned by success and drugs and interband squabbling and end up either dead or someplace sad talking about the glory days (or you know Axl Rose). One of the many frustrating things about The Runaways--and there are plenty of problems--is just how good the subject matter is that it tackles. First all-girl rock band Joan Jett Cherry Bomb Nineteen seventy-five and all the glittery eye-shadow that goes with it The film directed with a gritty eye by Floria Sigismondi was surprisingly successful when it came to casting. Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett channels all of her weird fidgety Twilight energy into a compelling tomboyish figure of a girl/woman who just wants to rock as hard--or harder--as her male counterparts (Ms. Jett also served as an executive producer on the film). And Dakota Fanning all grown up from her Dr. Seuss days is believable as jail-bait Cheri Currie--half David Bowie half Brigit Bardot picked by Svengali-like producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) for her looks and style before even going through the trouble of finding out whether she could sing. The film is at its best during its dreamy druggy montages watching the girls struggle to prove themselves and because of their teen ages figure out whether theyre actually badass chicks or just playing dress-up. But its when the music stops that we run into problems. For starters there are so many questions left unanswered While we get a peek into Ms. Curries backstory (left-behind sister flaky mom drunk dad) just where the hell Joan Jett came from remains a mystery (raised by wolves?) and ditto for her simmering rage (she pees on another bands guitar. Rock n roll). Ms. Fanning born in 1994 (read shriek) uses those spooky old-soul eyes to show world-weariness but when it comes to delivering dialogue both she and Ms. Stewart seem to be students of the Robitussin school of acting monosyllabic clunkers delivered as though half-asleep. Not so with the scene-chewing Mr. Shannon who seemed to be acting in an entirely different movie altogether. We see Currie and Jett do drugs and make out a few times but the movie does nothing to explore whatever complications that brought--if any--to their onstage and offstage relationship and only hints ever so briefly at what it did to the band dynamic. And speaking of the band what about the other three members? Each gets a handful of dialogue (oh Lita Ford you always get the shaft) but dont even make it into the heres-what-happened notes at movies end. One could argue that the Runaways paved the way for the Madonnas and Lady Gagas of the world--this movie hints at a really fascinating story but just barely scratches at its glittery surface. svilkomersonobserver.com Comment Filed under Dakota Fanning Floria Sigismondi Kristen Stewart Michael Shannon Movie Review The Runaways Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Breaking Miamis Wynwood Arts District Is a Hotbed for Zika Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/i-love-rock-n-roll,200,therunaways29,therunaways,observer
"Runaways The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; runaways-the ) Runaways The (United States 2010) March 16 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Runaways is a well-made but generic account of the rise and collapse of a musical group. In piecing together this partially fictionalized account of the mid-1970s girl rock band The Runaways writer/director Floria Sigismondi has erred on the side of sanitization omitting or softening some of the more lurid details of the behind-the-scenes goings-on. The movie is at its strongest when focusing on the musical elements the creation and improvisation of songs the rehearsals the concerts. It is also effective in illustrating the friendship/quasi-lesbian romance that blossoms between the two leads. Where it underperforms is in illustrating the home life of the central character Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) and in finding a satisfying stopping point. The Runaways form in 1975 when guitarist Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) separately approach manager/agent Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) and announce their intention to start an all-girl rock band. He puts them together and after they have practiced and written some material he helps bring on board the rest of the group guitarist Lita Ford (Scout Taylor- Compton) bassist ""Robin"" (a fictional composite played by Alia Shawkat) and singer Cherie Currie who is described as ""the lovechild of Bridget Bardot and Iggy Pop."" All the girls are under 19 with Currie being the youngest just shy of 16. When Kim discovers her he lets loose with a profanely joyful shout of ""Jailbait"" The Runaways are not an overnight success; in fact in North America they remain largely below the radar. Overseas especially in Japan they are big. Her first taste of fame and its associated pressures lead Currie to seek solace in alcohol and drugs. Eventually unable to cope she quits the band. Sigismondis primary source material for The Runaways is Curries autobiography Neon Angel. (Although its reasonable to expect that Jett who gets an Executive Producer credit provided input.) With this consideration its understandable that the movie slants in Curries direction. She is the only character for which the screenplay attempts to develop a home life. We are introduced to her twin sister Marie (Riley Keough) and are presented with scenes in which her father is depicted as falling-down drunk. Although Sigismondis desire is to represent Currie as a fully-formed character the non-band aspects of her life have a perfunctory half-developed feel. The movies closing scenes are problematic. Once Currie has left The Runaways the narrative flounders seemingly uncertain how and where to end. Sigismondis solution is to flash ahead several years to a point where Jett is a major star. This allows her to use some of Jetts best-known music (""I Love Rock n Roll"" ""Crimson and Clover"") in The Runaways waning moments. Yet the final connection between Currie and Jett is brief and unsatisfying. The three leads provide convincing performances with Dakota Fanning being the standout. Those who saw Fanning in Hounddog will not be astounded by the blatantly adult nature of her performance but those who think of her as a darling child actor are in for a shock. Fannings display of raw sexuality is at once impressive and a little disturbing; one would swear shes years ahead of the character she plays rather than the same age. It would not surprise me for this portrayal to generate some controversy about the appropriateness of some of what occurs on-screen. Kirsten Stewart veers as far away from Twilights Bella as one can imagine making a pronounced statement that the actress does not want to be defined by her best-known role. Indeed Stewart has shown a wellspring of talent over the years little of which is evident in the vampire movies but a portion of which is on display here. She and Fanning who are also appearing opposite each other in the Twilight series show solid chemistry making the foundation of The Runaways the relationship between Jett and Currie. Michael Shannon whose role as John Givings in Revolutionary Road earned him an Oscar nomination sinks his teeth into the part of Kim Fowley with a gusto that allows him to own his share of scenes. The over-the-top nature of the performance is intentional; theres no other way to effectively capture such a larger-than-life personality than by a little scenery-chewing. Shannons screen time is limited so that the presence of his character doesnt become too overbearing. The Runaways is very musical which is precisely what one would expect from a movie steeped in rock history and lore and brought to the screen by a woman whose reputation is founded on making music videos. Although neither Fanning nor Stewart are vocally equal to their cinematic alter-egos they do their own singing and the passion they put into belting out the lyrics allows us to forget that they arent Currie and Jett. Fannings ""Cherry Bomb"" doesnt match Curries but its nevertheless an effective rendition. The film is not the definitive tale of an era and how it responded to the emergence of women rock n rollers but its an effective and engaging telling of a familiar story of the price and fleeting nature of fame. The weaknesses are more than compensated for by the performances the art design (this feels like the 70s) and the soundtrack.

Plus the frenetic attack of Green Zone. By David Edelstein Published Mar 7 2010 ShareThis (Photo David Moir/Courtesy of Apparition) People will probably run to The Runaways the story of the pioneering seventies girl group to see Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett earn a bad reputation she doesnt give a damn about and little Dakota Fanning as 15-year-old Cherie Currie strut around the stage in skimpy outfits ch-ch-chanting that shes a ch-ch-cherry bomb and join Stewart in some heavy Sapphic smooching. In patches its agreeably lurid but its otherwise ho-hum. Although Jett is the coexecutive producer and Stewart the star the Jett character is mostly a bystander She stands by as rock impresario Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) assembles the pubescent girl band (as Malcolm McLaren assembled the Sex Pistols) then stands by some more as Currie the groups blonde-bombshell mascot falls apart from the drugs and sex and Fowley abuse. (The film is based on Curries slim autobiography published little more than a decade after the Runaways imploded.) As onetime member Victory Tischler-Blues documentary Edgeplay makes clear the vibe among the bandmates was never good and since the music itself is secondary theres not a lot to this story. The film is all externals. Shannon looks scary and stops the show with his rants but hes too endearingly damaged too nice to convey the real Fowleys otherworldly creepiness. Its Fannings movie You can taste the exchild actors relish for playing jailbait. But can she be ogled in good conscience? The taste is sweet and sour. When you study the subjects faces in policy wonk Charles Fergusons No End in Sight a sober 2007 documentary about the first year of the Iraq occupation you see not anger but bewilderment How could the Pentagon which allegedly fixed the intel around the policy get it so wrong? Were they so arrogant so obtuse that they couldnt foresee the deadly forces they were about to unleash? Hell yes avers Paul Greengrasss tumultuous conspiracy thriller Green Zone which is like No End in Sight with gun battles and cliff-hangers a boffo anti-Bush-administration answer to TVs hawkish 24. Matt Damon plays Army chief warrant officer Roy Miller whose team of (heavily armed) inspectors moves from site to site searching for WMDs taking casualties and coming up with doughnut holes. Pissed off he accosts an administration tool (Greg Kinnearis he meant to be Paul Bremer? Doug Feith?) who insists that the intel is dandy and prepares for the ultimate coup outlawing Saddams Baath Party and disbanding the Iraqi military. So Miller goes rogue and joins forces with a CIA vet (Brendan Gleeson) who sees Iraq exploding into civil war if the Baathists are banished. You might charge Brian Helgelands script (inspired by Rajiv Chandrasekarans nonfiction account Imperial Life in the Emerald City) with twenty-twenty hindsight except the book and doc prove that back in 2003 those warnings were expressedand suppressed. And even the foresight shouldve been twenty-twenty A 6-year-old with glaucoma couldnt have missed the coming conflagration. Green Zone is a slam-bam piece of muckraking and to my mind dead-on in its depiction of a traumatized Iraqi populace a criminally misused American military and a U.S.-backed charlatan (Ahmed Chalabi by another name) who smugly believes he can ease into leadership. But its also rather tawdry. The climax is as ludicrous as any Jack Bauer adventure and Greengrass is always on shaky ground. Literally. As in his Bourne movies his handheld camera shimmies and swerves using battlefield verite to drive home the faux realism. In the Greengrass zone theres no time or space for the quiet revelation the offhand but crystalline detail that transcends the melodramatic agenda. Its only the adrenaline-inducing techniques that conceal the lack of imagination. And its only Damons credible low-key acting that keeps the final twist involving a Baathist general and a reporter (Amy Ryan) clearly modeled on the New York Times Judith Miller (shes identified as from The Wall Street Journal) from seeming as preposterous as it is. Ryans Lawrie Dayne is rattled at the thought that shed been fooled by a Pentagon-staged farce involving a top-secret informanta marked contrast to the real Miller who defended her credulous reporting and loved her some Chalabi. A Hollywood touch Shes pleased at the thought of Roy Miller spilling the beans instead of monomaniacally assertinglike so many others in those dark yearsthat the catastrophic course must be stayed. Even Greengrass cant do justice to the perfidy of everyone involved. The Runaways Apparition. R. Green Zone Universal Pictures. R.E-mail filmcriticnewyorkmag.com. Share this story...

All-girl teenage band ""The Runaways"" once regarded as a prefab joke but now lionized as trailblazers are the subject of Floria Sigismondis first feature. Despite the helmers multidisciplinary background this proves a conventionally enjoyable making-and-breaking-of-the-band saga. Apparition plans a wide release March 19 which may lead to quick theatrical playoff since apart from Runaways fans the pics ideal audience -- teenage girls who will find it inspirational and cool -- wont necessarily flock to an unfamiliar 35-year-old story. But the names of Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning at the top of the cast will help and long ancillary life is assured. The film was exec produced by Joan Jett with Sigismondis script drawn from Cherie Curries 1989 autobiography ""Neon Angel"" and made with cooperation from other former Runaways (save subsequent heavy-metal guitar queen Lita Ford who not surprisingly isnt given much screen time or sympathy). This is in contrast to the 2005 feature doc ""Edgeplay A Film About the Runaways"" in which everyone but Jett was involved. The docu dished a lot more dirt than this narrative recap which both sweetens the bands tumultuous history and makes it a more traditional cautionary tale about the wild side of rock n roll. ""The Runaways"" does a good job setting the scene without laying on too much retro kitsch. It dutifully recalls the formation of the band Rhythm guitarist Jett (Stewart) and drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) are hanging out in the Bacchanalian mid-70s when they petition patronage from songwriter/producer/gadfly Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) who likes their idea of assembling an all-girl (and well-underage) hard-rock group. Blonde nymphet Currie (Fanning) is recruited for her looks with signature song ""Cherry Bomb"" written on the spot when she shows up with Peggy Lees ""Fever"" as her audition rather than the song assigned by Suzy Quatro (the Runaways only real grrl-rocker model then). Combative Ford provides the flashy lead guitar licks and ... well there were a lot of bassists (Alia Shawkat plays a conglomerate figure named ""Robin""). With some in the band as young as 13 at the time of its formation and nearly all from broken homes they naturally find the pressures of touring and fame overwhelming. Fowleys manipulations and penny-pinching are no help; neither are the eras too-accessible hedonistic excesses. Loose emphasis is on the frisson between songwriter/peacemaker Jett and singer Currie whose promotion as the acts sexploitative focus causes resentment among other members. Two are seen as having a Sapphic relationship of vague duration while Currie also beds older roadie Scottie (Johnny Lewis). An abortion is omitted from pics narrative however. The pic tends to exaggerate the groups impact since the band came on the scene when metalheads were certain ""chicks cant rock."" Mainstream rock n pop auds found them too hard while others viewed them as a gimmicky jailbait sideshow packaged by well-known weirdo Svengali Fowley. The group got a lot of attention but not much respect (or record sales for its three 1976-77 Mercury albums). Later the pic shows them being greeted with superstar-level hysteria in Japan. Presumably for legal reasons allegations of abuse against Fowley (other than the verbal kind) are not addressed. (They are in ""Edgeplay"" wherein ex-Runaways wax positively vitriolic.) Though sometimes her usual neurotic tics distract ""Twilights"" Stewart is a good fit for the tough but good-natured Jett who carried on as frontwoman after Currie left then launched a far more successful solo career. In line with many previous roles Fanning emphasizes Curries vulnerability -- making her a sexy nice-girl victim -- though the bratty dangerously needy character seen in old clips discussed by bandmates in ""Edgeplay"" and even glimpsed in Curries own book seems more interesting. Shannon has a field day as the uniquely foul-mouthed temperamentally perverse Fowley. Riley Keough has a substantial role as Curries sister Marie; Tatum ONeal and Brett Cullen appear very briefly as the Curries divorced neglectful parents. Apart from some druggy scenes the presentation is pretty straightforward albeit energetic enough and benefiting from Benoit Debies astute lensing. Other design/tech factors are solid. The soundtrack (which includes numerous other artists of the era) rocks naturally. Only Currie Jett and Fowley are afforded where-are-they-now onscreen text epilogues which seems unfair and should be corrected before release to include at least Ford and West. Runtime listed doesnt include the full final credits which werent on the Sundance premiere print.
