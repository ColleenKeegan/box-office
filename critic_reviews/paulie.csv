A talking parrots Pilgrims Progress across America ""Paulie"" has moments of minor charm but lacks the magic to fully capture the imaginations of either children or adults. Too sophisticated and dialogue-heavy for very young kids this DreamWorks release is targeted at 5-to-11-year-olds and should score some moderate biz for the first weekend or two but looks unlikely to become a must-see even for that crowd. Its also mysterious why the distrib chose to bring the film to the marketplace the week most kids go back to school rather than at the beginning of spring break. ""Paulie"" probably features more verbiage from animatronic animals than any film since ""Babe"" but falls conspicuously short of that classics inventiveness and emotion. In addition pics sense of humor is rooted in a wisecracking almost vaudevillian style that may fly right over the heads of many moppets. Emotional manipulation of the opening reel hooks the viewer effectively enough. Misha (Tony Shalhoub) a new janitor at an animal re-search lab takes pity on a Blue-crown Conure parrot caged in a dingy basement and is amazed to discover that the bird can not only ""talk"" in the manner expected of parrots but can converse. Asking his new feathered friend how so gifted a creature came to such sorry straits Misha is warned by Paulie that its a long story; Misha then wryly admits that as a Russian immigrant he has nothing against long stories. So Paulie spins the tale of his varied odyssey one that begins in flashback with a happy childhood as the pet of Marie (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) a little girl whose stutter the parrot helps her overcome. But when Marie takes to the roof to teach the fearful Paulie how to fly and accidentally falls to the ground its bye-bye birdie. After an all-too-brief stint in a pawnshop owned by smart-mouthed Artie (Buddy Hackett) from whom he evidently learns the art of the joke and the insult Paulie is taken up by the mildly eccentric Ivy (Gena Rowlands) who agrees to help Paulie find Marie by driving the bird cross-country in her RV when they learn the girls family has moved to Los Angeles. But just when youre getting to know Ivy and settle in for the ride scenarist Laurie Craig throws in the pics weirdest left turn by abruptly having Ivy go blind then die. Effect of this development is not so much unsettling as utterly bewildering and leaves Paulie no choice but to screw up his courage and fly the rest of the way to L.A. where he takes a liking to a yellow girl parrot and briefly becomes a dancer at a taco stand run by Ignacio (Cheech Marin). But ill fortune soon lands the bird in the hands of researcher Dr. Reingold (Bruce Davison) who realizes that Paulies skills could be his ticket to the top in the academic world. The crafty bird plays along with Reingold on the understanding that the doc will soon return him to Marie but when hes betrayed Paulie reverts to ""Polly-want-a-cracker"" mode thus dashing Reingolds ambitions but also dooming him to the dungeon. Remainder of the tale involves the sympathetic Mishas efforts to spirit Paulie out of the lab and into Maries hands. The escape is per-functorily handled by helmer John Roberts without generating any suspense and ending is predictable albeit with one unexpected twist. Yarns episodic nature makes it rely rather too heavily on longish dialogue scenes between Paulie and whomever hes with at the moment creating patience-stretching interludes for youngsters waiting for something more exciting to happen. Unfortunately pic also comes up short in that regard as it never lets loose with any flights of fancy literal or otherwise; Paulies potentially promising romance is dropped without comment and the couple of life-or-death scrapes are tame even by kidpic standards. Even Paulies moment as a lab animal liberationist has equivocal impact since its clear that all the uncaged critters will be able to be rounded up again within minutes. Despite all the unfulfilled potential film has an elemental emotional appeal that is markedly abetted by Shalhoubs sensitive but unsentimental work as the lonely former literature teacher desperate for someone to talk to in his adoptive country. Performing opposite a pretend animal (voiced in curious street-ese by Jay Mohr who also appears as a two-bit con man) Shalhoub persuasively makes the man-parrot relationship come alive. Marin is lively but underused as the small-time entrepreneur who appreciates Paulies talents. Except for a few flying shots which have an artificial look Paulie is a credibly lifelike creation thanks to an expert mix of the work of animal stunt coordinator Boone Narr and animatronic ace Stan Winston. Other technical work is OK but unexceptional across the boards with obvious California locations standing in for settings throughout the nation.

Comments Paulie Paulie is an intelligent parrot the cherished pet of a little girl whose parents disagree about the best approach to her speech therapy; hes separated from her after his command of English leads to a dangerous misunderstanding. Years of adventurous encounters--with Gena Rowlands Cheech Marin Jay Mohr--are presented in flashback as Paulie explains to a new friend (Tony Shalhoub) how he ended up in a cage in the dark basement of a research building where Shalhoub who plays a recent immigrant has landed a job as a janitor. Shalhoub gives an impressively nuanced performance in the dangerously cliched role and Paulie--a combination of trained parrots animatronics and the voice of Mohr--comes across as a fully developed character in a story thats sweetly if generically philosophical. John Roberts directed a screenplay by Laurie Craig (1998).

Starring Gena Rowlands Tony Shalhoub Cheech Marin Bruce Davison and Trini Alvarado. Directed by John Roberts. (PG. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Continuing a strained infatuation with animals as live action characters DreamWorks Pictures the studio responsible for ""Mousehunt"" today releases ""Paulie"" the cross-country adventure of a parrot that not only talks but understands human speech as it jokes and carries on conversations with people. ""Paulie"" at Bay Area theaters has a lot of heart and will probably fly with audiences. But its by no means a sure bet. For one thing its hard to warm up to a bird even one with wit and personality. Birds are after all only a few feathers away from reptiles. They have cold eyes ugly feet no body language. But Paulie is a fairly cute bird. The trained Blue-crown Conure (14 were used) that talks only to people he likes is pleasant to watch though far from cuddly or fuzzy. Sweet wise and funny at times ""Paulie"" is also a desperately uneven comedy adventure that tries plucking a few too many heartstrings and pushes the wise-guy patter a tad too far. At the storys most affecting when a caged and dispirited Paulie relates his disheartening troubles to sympathetic Russian immigrant Misha (Tony Shalhoub) a newly hired janitor at an animal-research laboratory the film works like a charm. One almost leans toward the screen wanting to be in on the heart-to-heart talk between two raw souls. Both the plucky bird and the newcomer Misha are scared strangers in a strange land and Shalhoubs sad-eyed earnest way of coaxing the parrot out of its cowering silence in a hostile environment is touching and lovely. But Paulie with the Brooklynesque wise-guy voice of Jay Mohr (who also plays a two-bit hustler named Benny) soon gets irritating. And part of the films comic gimmick -- that Paulie doesnt know when to shut up -- backfires. Paulie is the pet of a button-cute girl named Marie (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) who stutters. Her insensitive dad fearing too much attachment gets rid of the bird and Marie and her parents subsequently move from New Jersey to California. By determined wing and by calculated flights of charm with amazed people he befriends Paulie undertakes a mission to find Marie. Paulie favors oddballs like himself. He lands in a pawnshop with Buddy Hackett doing Buddy Hackett. Soon he grabs the attention of an eccentric woman named Ivy (Gena Rowlands) trying to cope with her golden years as a recent widow. Rowlands is captivating in the role and for a while viewers might wish she would simply carry the movie away leaving Paulie in the dust. The parrot though is nothing if not persistent and Paulie cajoles Ivy into freshening up her life by helping him reunite with Marie in California. So off they go in Ivys beat-up old Winnebago and a pleasant spree of on-the-road chatter eats up a fair chunk of running time. When Paulie finally reaches California he meets fellow birds a trio of performing parrots named Lupe Pepe and Paco kept by a happy burrito vendor named Ignacio (Cheech Marin). But the hustler Benny kidnaps Paulie. The bird ultimately winds up imprisoned in an animal-research lab overseen by ambitious Dr. Reingold (Bruce Davison in an unappealing role). The bird antics in this film provide a few amazing moments (some were done using animatronics). Mohrs Paulie voice is synched to match movements of the birds beak and there are wonderful flight sequences that fetchingly show off the parrots blue and green plumage. ""Paulie"" has elements of a good weepy but overall it never quite gels beyond being a passable novelty. One can only wonder what lies ahead in the DreamWorks menagerie of movie stars.

That description may prompt cries of oxymoron but Paulie the gabby sassy hero of this warm and witty family film is definitely a bird of a different color especially if you come from a city where the avian population mainly consists of sparrows and pigeons. Paulie is a green-and-blue conure a member of the parrot family and there are two major reasons Paulie doesnt do much flying during the great adventure that takes him across years and across the continent from New York to California in search of his true love. Paulie doesnt fly much because he is afraid of heights and because when first encountered this peripatetic parrot is padlocked inside an old cage in the almost sunless littered basement of a research institute undernourished and condemned to a metal perch (cruelly hard on the feet say those in the know). How did Paulie come to this sorry state? The only person who cares enough to ask is a lonely newly employed emigre janitor named Misha (Tony Shalhoub). When Paulie tells him its a long story the screenwriter Laurie Craig provides Misha with the sort of lines that make Paulie fun for adults as well as children Im Russian. I like long stories. Once upon a time Paulie was a gift from a grandfather to a little girl named Marie (Hallie Kate Eisenberg) who suffered from a speech impediment. Although the efforts of adults to banish her stutter were not productive Paulie her best friend was an able teacher. But the idea that a bird might actually talk rather than mimic is scoffed at by the adults and eventually Paulie is exiled. When next encountered Paulie is a tart-tongued resident of a pawn shop where he is bought by the widowed Ivy (Gena Rowlands) who lives in a mobile home on the New Jersey side of the Hudson. Hearing of Paulies dream of reunion with little Marie whose family has moved Ivy literally pulls up stakes and the two head west. But Ivys health is failing and one day Paulie is on his own bound for California. Before the happy ending Paulie will become part of a song-and-dance act at a burrito stand a kidnap victim and a cat burglar. (Is that another oxymoron?) Eventually he winds up in the clutches of Dr. Reingold (Bruce Davison) a glory-seeking animal-behavior researcher who reneges on a promise to reunite Paulie with Marie whereupon Paulie figuratively bites his tongue literally bites people and for his silence and snippiness is sentenced to the basement. Directed by John Roberts Paulie is full of fine human performances by Mr. Shaloub as the endearing Misha Ms. Rowlands as Ivy Buddy Hackett as Artie of the pawn shop Cheech Marin as Ignacio of the burrito stand Miss Eisenberg as Marie Mr. Davison as the mean Dr. Reingold and Jay Mohr who does double duty as the birdnapper and as the voice of Paulie. As for this sassy bird the publicity materials for the film say Paulie is played by 14 live blue-crown conures and one animatronic Paulie used for complex expressions and dangerous scenes. And 18 other conures play Lupe Paco and Pepe who join Paulie in the burrito stand song-and-dance act. Like the rest of Paulie it is something to behold. Paulie is rated PG (Parental Guidance Suggested). It includes scenes of domestic discord a childs frightening fall burglary bird-snatching sharp insults and avian flatulence. PAULIE Directed by John Roberts; written by Laurie Craig; director of photography Tony Pierce-Roberts; edited by Bruce Cannon; music by John Debney; production designer Dennis Washington; produced by Mark Gordon Gary Levinsohn and Allison Lyon Segan; released by Dreamworks SKG. Running time 92 minutes. This film is rated PG. WITH Gena Rowlands (Ivy) Tony Shalhoub (Misha) Cheech Marin (Ignacio) Bruce Davison (Dr. Reingold) Jay Mohr (voice of Paulie/Benny) Buddy Hackett (Artie) and Hallie Kate Eisenberg (Marie).

In flashback he relates the tale of how he befriended a stuttering little girl named Marie and was then separated from her. The creators of this surprisingly low-tech childrens fable (Jay Mohrs voice is dubbed over shots of an actual talking parrot and some unobtrusive puppets) have appropriated the wistful long-voyage-back-to-my-first-friend structure of Lassie Come Home and Stuart Little but in tone the picture is closer to a birdbrained version of Lancelot Link Secret Chimp. Paulie hooks up with such characters as a kindly-eccentric trailer-home widow (Gena Rowlands) and a taco vendor (Cheech Marin) who in the one halfway infectious sequence leads a chorus line of birds in a mariachi production number. But the rambling episodic structure keeps the movie from achieving any true comic or sentimental vitality. After Babe with its rowdy barnyard of chattering beasties Paulies lone wise-guy parrot seems a hero in search of a menagerie.
