Comments The Powerpuff Girls Movie This Cartoon Network feature-length animation manages to teach kids some good lessons and amuse the grown-ups without overdosing on pop-culture references. The three huge-eyed heroines--the result of a lab experiment involving sugar spice and ""Chemical X""--are well-meaning well-behaved little girls who just happen to have superpowers and their creator Professor Utonium tries to teach them how to balance their desire to fit in with their need to be accepted for their specialness. As the girls battle a mutant monkey there are references to everything from Japanese animation and UPA cartoons of the 1950s to Planet of the Apes and King Kong and though the action is a bit intense for very young kids its probably no worse than what they see on television.

But perhaps I can at least in some practical or pedantic way usefully describe its outlines and effects. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - It was not of course an absolutely foolproof project -- it might have been subcontracted to a middle school art class or voiced by a French Canadian hockey team or conceived merely as the precursor to a video game or as a fast-food merchandise tie-in. (Note ""merely."" More than 1 billion worth of PpG stuff has been moved so far.) All kinds of things could have gone wrong that didnt the film having been left in the hands of the series creators -- Craig McCracken et al. -- whose devotion to the integrity of their 2-D progeny is as intense and touching as Professor Utoniums own. The brand has not been betrayed and despite the (I suppose relatively) pricey special effects and dollopings of digital whipped cream the movie still feels handmade and personal the natural product of people whose lives even before they were made profitable by them were unusually dominated by cartoons.Typically for a superhero summer blockbuster The Powerpuff Girls Movie is an origin story expanding upon and somewhat deepening (just why was that guy making little girls in his laboratory?) what every PpG show covers in about four seconds of opening titles. It is not sentimental in the Way of Walt and the cuteness of little Blossom Bubbles and Buttercup though it seems to stimulate directly excitement centers in the preteen female brain must be held in some degree ironic. Also the cuteness is no more important than the ass kicking -- indeed the films great epiphany is that violence correctly applied can constitute a civic virtue. I think of my niece Zoe who at the age of 13 knows 27 ways to cripple an attacker. Ah youth.As with any film based on an indefinitely ongoing TV series there are unities to observe Everything that is true at the beginning of an episode must be true at the end; character if sometimes complex is immutable. Which means the real advantages here are visual. The Powerpuff Girls Movie is possibly not the best ever episode -- I mean there are so many to choose from and we all have our favorites -- but it is certainly the most beautiful. The hand of man is legible in most every frame; the art (references drawn primarily from the odd-numbered decades the 30s 50s 70s 90s) has the electrical snap of a great old Saul Bass title sequence and not only argues for the almost moral superiority of plain old cell animation over the industrial-grade pixilated polish of Toy Story and Shrek but strikes a blow for abstraction. Professor Utonium is all straight lines and angles; the girls have no noses and eyes the size of dessert plates. Yet they read as real. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

This bigscreen spinoff from the popular Cartoon Network series does enter the crowded marketplace with widespread name recognition and a sizable fan base. The looney-tooniest summer in recent memory proceeds apace with ""The Powerpuff Girls"" the third animated feature (after ""Lilo amp; Stitch"" and ""Hey Arnold The Movie"") to hit megaplexes within a fortnight. On the plus side this bigscreen spinoff from the popular Cartoon Network series enters the crowded marketplace with widespread name recognition and a sizable fan base. Still How many toons are too many? Early numbers for ""Hey Arnold"" indicate that even during summer months aud appetite for family fare isnt exactly insatiable. Given track records of similar low-budget adaptations of TV fare (""Dougs 1st Movie"" ""Recess Schools Out"") plus lackluster opening B.O. ""Girls"" isnt likely to strike gold until the toon reaches homevid. Of course theres always the possibility that pic will be a freakish reprise of the ""Pokemon The First Movie"" phenomenon. If lightning does indeed strike twice chalk it up to the appeal of frenetic (if not frenzied) visuals and near-surreally stylized storytelling. Much of ""Powerpuff Girls"" -- backgrounds foregrounds individual characters -- recalls the sharp-angled minimalism common to animated TV ads of the 50s and early 60s. But the rapid-fire editing and turbo-charged action sequences are (literally) flashy enough to be borderline hypnotic. The tongue-in-cheek premise pivots on the efforts of a square-jawed scientist Professor Utonium (voiced by Tom Kane) to create three perfect little girls with a carefully calibrated confluence of sugar spice and everything nice. But the experiment takes an unforeseen turn when Mojo the professors pet monkey accidentally knocks a dose of Chemical X into the mix. One thing leads to another and the Powerpuff Girls -- Blossom (Catherine Cavadini) Bubbles (Tara Strong) and Buttercup (E.G. Daily) -- are born. Theyre sweet little things of kindergarten age size and temperament. But they also sport eyes that flash laser beams superhuman strength and the ability to run and fly at warp speed. (Mind you they dont appear to have any fingers or even hands but never mind.) These girls just want to have fun. But when they try to play tag during an overextended but frequently funny sequence of gleeful anarchy they demolish much of Townsville and enrage the residents. Widely despised because theyre ""different"" the girls are anxious to redeem themselves. Unfortunately they naively listen to the promises of Mojo who has been Chemical X-tended into Mojo Jojo (Roger L. Jackson) and talks the girls into helping him build a Help-the-Town-and-Make-It-a-Better-Place Machine. But when the wily monkey reveals his true evil intention the heroines must battle an army of chemically enhanced primates. Even at 74 minutes ""Powerpuff Girls"" feels more than a little padded and repetitive. Still the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters. (The MPAA gave the pic a PG for ""nonstop frenetic animated action."") The overall visual scheme of the TV series created by Craig McCracken -- pics director co-writer and executive producer -- has been faithfully preserved for the bigscreen. The hand-drawn animation is deliberately skittish and herky-jerky which clearly is intended as part of the joke. Like the TV series ""The Powerpuff Girls"" is simultaneously pitched at two different auds Small children who will accept it as rock-em sock-em excitement with a touch of gender-specific empowerment and hipper teens and grown-ups who can appreciate the whole thing as a semisatirical hoot.

USATODAY.com - Three busy little Bs cant save Powerpuff movie Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 07/03/2002 - Updated 1027 AM ET Three busy little Bs cant save Powerpuff movie By Mike Clark USA TODAY Warner Brothers Mojo Jojo Blossom Buttercup and Bubbles are The Powerpuff Girls. Having milked the Pokemon franchise into three big-screen features that no one over 7 could understand Warner Bros. now slaps its logo (plus Casablancas signature tune As Time Goes By) on The Powerpuff Girls Movie (). When you have the bulging release schedule of an AOL Time Warner subsidiary theres always a new family movie on the horizon. And though Girls isnt much its just lively enough to placate its limited audience to make it an easy choice over Scooby-Doos stale Alpo. Otherwise heres a Cartoon Network offspring brazenly delivering the movies smartest gag right at the beginning an off-screen narrator flawlessly imitating the nutty opening dialogue to Ed Woods infamously awful Plan 9 From Outer Space. Shortly after that a professor creates the girls after his simian assistant accidentally knocks something called Chemical X into a laboratory mix a la Howard Hawks far funnier Monkey Business. These filmmakers must have watched a lot of late late shows when they were kids. The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes which unfortunately dont enable them to discern flimsy screenplays. The girls are uncomfortable with their powers and this is doubly true after monkey Jojo mutates into the evil Mojo Jojo who tricks the trio into cooperating with his scheme to control Townsville. There isnt much more to the story except for one raucous game of tag and a come-to-the-rescue finale where the girls prove their mettle. Visually the movie is on the minimalist side and it would have been nice if the little Bs had used their supernatural powers to come up with a few more animated lip movements per word. South Park fans will note that the girls cranial shapes are virtually identical to Parks boys. Just imagine their round-headed progeny with laser-beam eyes and rancid vocabularies.

""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" explains how Blossom Bubbles and Buttercup came to be the protectors of the City of Townsville. More Power to em 1 / 1 Back to Gallery THE POWERPUFF GIRLS MOVIE Cartoon animation. Voiced by Catherine Cavadini  Tara Strong E.G. Daily Roger L. Jackson  Tom Kane and Tom Kenny . Directed by Craig McCracken . (PG. 84 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Girls rule. Girls kick well major backside. Especially cute kindergarten girls with superpowers. Any fan of Cartoon Networks brilliantly conceived ""Powerpuff Girls"" series already knows how cool Blossom Buttercup and Bubbles are. The cartoon which first aired in 1995 and then became a regular series in 1998 has already generated more than 1 billion (yes billion) in retail sales of all kinds of PPG paraphernalia. An entire Delta Airlines plane was once painted with the ""Powerpuff Girls"" on it. But now with the first feature movie the series tries to uniquely reintroduce the girls and tells for the first time the entire story of their creation and how they werent always the saviors of the City of Townsville. ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" adeptly weaves a story for fans and first- timers alike but along the way does something a little odd for a kids film It caters more obliquely to adult viewers who for years have fueled the series from cult hit to superstardom. How else to explain the PG rating (for ""nonstop frenetic animated action"" according to the Motion Picture Association of America) on a film about kindergartners? In fact ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" comes off slightly darker and even more violent than the series itself. The core audience of course will be kids (and their parents) already familiar with the girl-power butt-kicking that Blossom Buttercup and Bubbles are capable of. The assumption is that any PC-sensitivities about depicting them wreaking havoc on evil-doers is washed away by the morality tale therein. However if youre coming to this franchise as a neophyte expect a lot of punching kicking destroyed buildings cars hurled everywhere and your general implements of destruction by evil-doers pretty much on display throughout the film. And that line about nonstop frenetic action couldnt be more right on -- ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie"" is 84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare. Its also clearly great fun. The attraction to the cuddly threesome has always been their girlish jocularity coupled with their ability to destroy meanies before bedtime. Craig McCracken the creator of the series and the director and executive producer of this first feature film gives viewers a little more back story on the girls and how they came to be. Seems that the City of Townsville has always been overrun by crime -- thugs roaming freely tormenting everyone. Good guy Professor Utonium harking back to simpler times wants to create ""the perfect little girl"" someone who can bring sweetness to life. He adds the now famous ingredients -- sugar spice and everything nice but his wild lab monkey Jojo accidentally knocks into Professor Utonium shattering a lethal jar of Chemical X in the process. The resulting explosion creates not one but three perfect little girls -- who happen to have laser-beam eyes the ability to fly and run at light speed and unheard of strength. But boy with those big eyes and squeaky voices they sure are cute. Unfortunately the blast has also turned Jojo into a villain who redubs himself Mojo Jojo as his powers grow. Over at Pokey Oaks the timid girls have their first day of kindergarten class. And once theyre indoctrinated into the ways of tag-youre-it all hell breaks loose and they nearly destroy the City of Townsville. Ostracized they are duped by Mojo Jojo into using their powers to create the Help-the-Town-and-Make-It-a-Better-Place Machine which of course is not really what hes going to use it for. Along the way there are plenty of wonderful sight gags and the ""Powerpuff Girls"" trademark sense of humor which proves a good time for adults. Some parents may be caught off guard by the amped up good vs. evil fisticuffs and mayhem and the darker tone. However for those who dont have a problem with that the animation is as always superb and the story line endearing and funny. ""The Powerpuff Girls"" has always been about female empowerment and the simple genius of three cute girls going off -- a cartoon essentially made for adults and readjusted ever-so-slightly for the kiddie crowd. Its a potently entertaining mix provided everyones on the same page about it. Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr B The Powerpuff Girls Movie Genre Animation Kids and Family; Starring Cathy Cavadini Elizabeth Daily Tara Strong; Director Craig McCracken; Author Charlie Bean Lauren Faust; Release Date Wide 07/03/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 82; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 2 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT Dont underestimate the groove quotient of Bubbles Blossom and Buttercup the three little girls with superpowers who regularly save the world before bedtime on the Cartoon Network series ""The Powerpuff Girls."" They may not have the boobies of ""Charlies Angels"" and they certainly dont have the snark of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" but the three kindergarteners make up for their lack of irony with laser-power eyes radical post-post-postfeminist blithe confidence and some of the coolest retro-futuristic animation style this side of Gerald McBoing-Boing. The Powerpuff Girls Movie is of course just the TV series gone wide-screen and the same constants apply Their unconditionally accepting daddy-o guardian Professor Utonium (voiced by Tom Kane) thinks the world of the babes he accidentally invented (when Chemical X spilled into the usual recipe of Sugar Spice and Everything Nice); Mojo Jojo (Roger L. Jackson) a maniacal monkey also high on Chem-X wants to rule the world; and the girls just wanna have fun. But those new to the series (created and directed here by Craig McCracken) as well as the already committed will dig the anarchic Chicks Rule attitude and the snazzy art. Bonus for the hip The movie is preceded by a short and excellently loony cartoon from Dexters Laboratory in which Dexter gets chicken pox and must...scratch.
