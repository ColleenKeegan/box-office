Leading Serbian adman turned helmer Milos Jovanovic orchestrates a stream-of-consciousness dream state in ""Memo"" his debut feature. Pic traces how war and totalitarian regimes toss one family along the soul-destroying currents of the mid-20th century. Designed to replicate memory with all its distortions and irrational emphases ""Memo"" has difficulty sustaining an emotional connection due in part to a lack of incisive characters. Pic is a praiseworthy first feature but outside fest exposure takers will be thin. A lyrical opening is quickly interrupted by the first signs of the coming storm. Teen Benja Kon (Nemanja Jovanovic son of helmer and producer) lives with his family in an East European village whose inhabitants are either swept up by invading armies or collaborators acting out resentments on their neighbors. Jovanovic keeps identifiable symbols to a minimum so uniforms and places connote a range of oppressive Kafka-esque affiliations. Its too easy to ascribe the cinematic style to Kusturicas influence since Jovanovic uses the general Balkan penchant for absurdism as a means of critical exploration. Tech problems at screening meant only first 10 minutes were shown in 35mm -- lensing is crisp. MemoSerbia-Montenegro ProductionA Hammer Communications production in cooperation with Rasta Intl. /B92.

Do great costumes make a costume drama great? The answer to the first question is no but it helps. The answer to the second is absolutely not consider ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" (2005) an orgy of sumptuous silk wrapped around an anorectic drama or this years Oscar winner for best costumes ""Elizabeth The Golden Age"" which laid an overheated golden egg. The historical epics swashbucklers and literary romances that fall under the costume-drama rubric favor kings queens and aristocrats over the common man. Royalty may be rotten but it always looks good.The colors of Colonial New England on ample display in HBOs seven-part miniseries ""John Adams"" tend toward drab browns and grays. Lets admit it democracy was not stylish. This superficial but unavoidable fact may account for the underrepresentation of the American Revolution in Hollywood movies which have always preferred the hoop skirts and mossclad plantations of the Civil War era to the humble garb of 1770s Boston and Philadelphia. But ""John Adams"" based on David McCulloughs Pulitzer Prize-winning book proudly--and successfully based on the four episodes available for review--rebels against the slick romantic conventions of the typical Hollywood costume drama.How could you not if you choose the squat cranky resolutely unglamorous Adams as your protagonist and put a bald bewigged Paul Giamatti in the role? Dispensing with Adamss early years as the son of a farmer and illiterate mother director Tom Hooper and writer Kirk Ellis begin their saga in 1770 at the time of the Boston Massacre. Adams already wed to Abigail (Laura Linney) and the father of four children is hired as a lawyer to defend the British troops who fired upon the rebellious Boston mob an unpopular assignment but one that demonstrates his unwavering commitment to the rule of law--and shows off his strategic brilliance. This first episode wont get your blood racing. Its a bit pokey and theres little to delight the eye in those plain New England chambers. Be patient the pugnacious Adams a fascinating mixture of humility and ambition grows on you and he is soon joined by an all-star team of supporting revolutionaries Ben Franklin (Tom Wilkinson) Thomas Jefferson (Stephen Dillane) and the towering soft-spoken Gen. George Washington (David Morse with nose putty) a sight gag himself when standing next to the diminutive Adams. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Any lover of rough-and-tumble backroom politics will be swept up in the debates and horse-trading compromises as the representatives to the Continental Congress agonize whether to break from England. We have the delicious sensation of eavesdropping on the birth of a nation. Pennsylvanias John Dickinson (Zeljko Ivanek) fearing a bloodbath urges compromise and conciliation while the wily acerbic Franklin teaches the headstrong Adams the arts of political subterfuge and urges Jefferson to remove the whiff of the pulpit from a phrase in the Declaration of Independence. This is a show that loves the telling detail. Theres a rare intimacy to the series approach to epochal historic events. Theres no Valley Forge no Paul Revere ride but were thrust onto the storm-tossed Atlantic when a seasick Adams accompanied by his 14-year-old son John Quincy sails to France to make an alliance with Louis XVI. Favoring gritty authenticity over romantic gloss Hooper (""Elizabeth I"" ""Longford"") doesnt spare us the sight of a wounded naval officer undergoing an amputation by hacksaw the queasy-making process by which Abigail and her children are inoculated against smallpox or the nastiness of a crowd of Boston patriots tarring and feathering an English seaman.The gray palette is radically transformed during Adamss long sojourn in France Holland and England. Unlike the sly sybaritic Franklin hes a disaster in Paris; in this leisurely world of powdered faces and baroque artifice the blunt aggressive Adams is as welcome as an un-housebroken mutt. In the wonderful fourth episode the wise Abigail joins him and their reunion--passionate and almost wordless years of pent-up frustration awkwardly released--is moving in an unexpected way. The shows deliberate sotto voce style may strike some as more English than American (the director is a Brit) but it pays off in one finely observed scene after another youre not likely to forget Adamss nerve-racking encounter with a strange google-eyed King George who must welcome the ambassador from the nation that has just severed itself from his dominion.Among the many things that make ""John Adams"" resonate--its emphasis on the importance of diplomacy in world affairs its reminder of the contested principles upon which the country was based--is the marriage of John and Abigail which feels strikingly modern without being anachronistic. Its a lovely quirky portrait of a union based on true friendship and intellectual equality.Trying to make historical dramas ""relevant"" however has its dangers. The disastrous Demi Moore version of ""The Scarlet Letter"" (1995) didnt think kids would go for all that Sin and Redemption stuff so it turned Hester Prynne into a centerfold-worthy feminist heroine everything that followed was hilariously wrongheaded. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" based on Philippa Gregorys best-selling novel takes shameless fictional liberties with the facts about Anne Boleyn her sister Mary and Henry VIII and his break from the Catholic Church. With Scarlett Johansson as the demure ""other"" sister who wins the kings love but gets dumped even after giving him a male heir and Natalie Portman as the Machiavellian Anne who drives the randy king (Eric Bana) wild by withholding her sexual favors ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" initially intrigues as a witty portrait of sexual gamesmanship at a time when women were pawns in a royal game. But it loses steam when the catfighting abruptly gives way to grim realpolitik. Portman keeps growing as an actress but she doesnt yet have the psychic or physical stature required to play Anne--this role demands a diva. Though she does look smashing in emerald green which as anyone whos seen ""Atonement"" knows seems to be this seasons color of desire.The most memorable costume dramas must find the balance between spectacle and intimacy so that the clothes become expres-sions of the soul. Two Italian masters of the form Luchino Visconti (""Senso"" ""The Leopard"") and Bernardo Bertolucci (""The Last Emperor"") happened to be both supreme cinematic sensualists and Marxists and the tension between their worship of aristocratic splendor (Visconti was born a count) and their political ideology resulted in seductive lushly ambivalent art. The contrast between the physical beauty and the moral hollowness of the 18th-century salons in Stephen Frearss ""Dangerous Liaisons"" set off wicked sparks. The bloody passions of 16th-century France flooded the screen in Patrice Chereaus operatic ""Queen Margot"" a movie as emotionally and sexually profligate as such Jane Austen movie gems as ""Persuasion"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"" are reticent and well behaved. Sofia Coppola in her ambitious deceptively frivolous ""Marie Antoinette"" tried to scramble our notions of past and present celebrity and royalty tossing a pair of anachronistic pink Converses into her display of 18th-century footwear illustrating among other things that while fashion is ephemeral our obsession with it is eternal. As different as these movies are they all succeed in converting the past into an emotional present tense. A bad costume drama on the other hand is like a museum where youre always aware that history sits behind glass. A good one makes us forget that were slouching in a theater in jeans and sneakers.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The line is never actually spoken but the acidic tang of All About Eve with its cat-calls and bitch-fights hangs over this adaptation of Arthur Goldens all-conquering novel like a cynical spirit observer. Spanning the 30s and 40s Memoirs of a Geisha traces the fortunes of Chiyo bundled off as a child to endure life on the bottom rung of an okiya (geisha household) triumphantly reinvented as ultra-glam Sayuri but thrown another curveball when war breaks out.Rob Marshalls first film was Chicago and Memoirs... aint short on razzle-dazzle. Colours costumes and design are relentlessly luminous sumptuous and exquisite even at the plots lowest points when Sayuri is cruelly ravished its in front of a collection of antique kimonos; when shes evacuated to rural poverty yards of glorious silk still billow in the wind. Could these be intended as intimations of the dark side of glamour? If so they ring hollow in a film rendered kitsch by its own conspicuous artifice the liberties with Japanese period detail the use of Chinese actors the English dialogue.Yet Memoirs... does engage as a tale of this tiny world of women with its venomous rivalry and unexpected kindness. Gong Li steals the show as bitchy top dog Hatsumomo while Michelle Yeoh is all class as Sayuris mentor. Zhang Ziyi is sympathetic in the lead but Sayuri is ultimately dispiritingly passive while all around her sisters are doing it for themselves she is moulded by others and longs only for a big strong man. This fairy-tale sentimentality pales besides such bracingly nasty moments as when the okiya mother suspecting Hatsumomo of illicit sex jams her fingers into her crotch and sneeringly sniffs.

"A Tepid Cup Of Tea washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies A Tepid Cup Of Tea Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 16 2005 ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is everything youd expect it to be beautiful mesmerizing tasteful Japanese. Its just not very hot. It stars three of the worlds most beautiful women -- Ziyi Zhang Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh -- and its set in the inner world of the geisha those legendary Japanese figures of beauty and pinned-hair silken alabaster-skinned erotic temptation. Yet it just sits there glorious but fitfully absorbing never remotely enticing. The film never plumbs the allure of the geisha or offers much demonstration of her skills her ability to enchant. It never establishes why such a woman would be transcendent almost the female equivalent of the samurai -- a specialist so gifted in her art so unique in her meanings that her fame has long since gone global. Derived from Arthur Goldens phenomenally successful novel its the story of Sayuri Nitta born Chiyo the daughter of a poor fisherman who becomes one of Japans most revered geishas in the 1930s only to lose it all in World War II then gain it all back in that countrys postwar recovery. Golden somehow defied sexual and cultural barriers and acquired the voice of the beautiful gritty clever young woman taking readers deep into an unfamiliar world. But the books shortcomings remain the movies stately pace complete unawareness of the larger world beyond the geisha houses doors anthropological accuracy at the expense of dramatic dynamism and a disinterest generally in the relations and attractions of men to women and women to men. Moreover it skimps on the backstage preparations and the intrigue that many would argue was one of the best things about the book. Sayuri is played by Zhang in what can only be called a yeoman performance. This fiery young woman has exploded in nearly everything in which shes appeared since her breakthrough in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" but the role of Sayuri lacks the dynamism of those parts particularly her stunning turn last year as Mei in Zhang Yimous rapturous driven ""House of Flying Daggers."" Here shes limited to the dreary role of the Good Girl (a joy in real life but a pain in the movies) a passive victim to fortunes whimsy and never given a chance to let her full personality assert itself. On the other hand she serves a mean cup of tea. As the movie opens we discover 9-year-old Chiyo (played brilliantly by Suzuka Ohgo) on the most terrible night of her life Her mother has slipped into coma and will soon die her impoverished father (Mako) can no longer support her and her sister and so he sells them to a broker who cruelly yanks them from their seacoast cottage through a lashing rain (pathetic symbolic fallacy anyone?) to the big city. There he deposits the prettier Chiyo at a geisha house (always in search of new talent) and takes the other girl to a brothel. That is the terrible fate of rural-poor female children in financially uncertain times in Asia before the war two forms of prostitution the more-or-less benign (geisha involving 99 percent performance and 1 percent sex) and the more-or-more malign (whorehouse involving 99.9999 percent sex and .0001 percent performance). As terrible a passage as it has been arriving in the former instead of the latter -- like her poor soon-to-disappear sister -- was still the luckiest night in Chiyos life. Its also the single most compelling narrative arc in the film. Though shes brought in to become a geisha she is rebellious and escape-prone and thus relegated to the bitter role of household slave. But then the young womans life is changed by a chance encounter. Shes in town -- the city is an immaculately reconstructed vision of old Kyoto -- when a gentleman takes an interest in her and buys her a cherry ice. That fellow the Chairman played by the Ken Watanabe of ""The Last Samurai"" is so warm and charming she falls in love. When she sees hes accompanied by a beautiful geisha she decides herself to become a beautiful geisha in hopes of someday winning his heart. But -- a dramatic flaw -- Watanabes character never comes alive. Hes always seen from afar an idealized man soon revealed to be an aristocratic manufacturer. Question During the war did he build Zeroes or Bettys or Nambus? It goes unanswered in ""Geishas"" blinkered vision. As part of the blinkering none of what happens in the movie -- or the book -- confronts the basic notion of geisha and the movie leaves it to the audience to reject or embrace the concept. A kind of glorified party girl more renowned for wit and provocation than the actual down-and-dirty thang geisha in the movie are seen as proud and independent almost like movie stars fighting for popularity. That they exist primarily to fulfill male fantasies of pampered decadence and servitude is not addressed. Be that as it may for young Chiyo the choices are absolute slave or geisha. Early on she meets the woman who will be her lifelong antagonist the wicked yet undeniably beautiful Hatsumomo. Lucky Gong Li She gets the juiciest bad-girl movie part in years. Imperious conniving brilliant mean and sexy as hell Hatsumomo takes an immediate dislike to poor little Chiyo perhaps because she sees in the youngsters superb bone structure and unusual blue eyes a potential for beauty that will rival her own. And its not long in coming either as Chiyo by the magic of director Rob Marshalls ability to bridge decades in seconds is soon reinvented as Zhang whose appearance could cause buildings to say nothing of strong men and us weak ones to go all fluttery. Soon enough shes picked by another famous geisha Mameha (Yeoh) as a mentee and is primed to take over as Kyotos most famous tea companion. She will win the money that Mameha has paid for her by auctioning off her virginity. Much of the film chronicles what might be called geisha politics. Robin Swicords script follows as Mameha and Sayuri chart Sayuris rise while Hatsumomo and her protegee O-Kabo (the round faced Youki Kudoh) counterplot. Whenever Lis Hatsumomo is on screen the movie picks up; her charisma and cruelty may be reprehensible but they drive the film. All this is set against the wider if barely glimpsed background of elite Japanese industry and politics in the 1930s. That it was a time of turmoil and violence as various factions clashed over issues of war or peace industrialization or ruralization modernization or traditional stability goes almost thoroughly unexamined. The Chairman seems to wander in now and then accompanied by Nobu (Koji Yakusho so memorable in ""Shall We Dance"") a man more forthright in his love for Sayuri yet unsuitable because of a war injury to his face acquired while extending the empires boundaries in Manchuria. Yet at no point do the Chairman and Sayuri have what could be called a relationship; theyre almost never alone and their conversations are unrevealing. Theres only a mute secret adoration of a very young woman for a prosperous established older man. The whole thing is an idealization. What is this film selling? What is its prime attraction? It certainly isnt the story spasmodic as it is. Its more the sense of a secret world penetrated. In fact Marshall (he did the Oscar-winning ""Chicago"") loves to move his camera forward through doors and down hallways into inner chambers. Theres a sense of going where nobody -- or no Westerner particularly no Western man -- has gone before. Were in the womens inner sanctum sensing an ambiance utterly different where beauty and grace are the center of being and the placement of the feet in arising from a bow as important as tariff policy or invasion plans. History comes and goes quickly as in the book. The war between hard covers seemed to last 10 pages and here it lasts about 10 minutes and finds Sayuri in a new world where the power is held by gross stupid loud beings called . . . Americans. They must be catered to as well. But ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" on the screen as well as on paper seems to lack a dramatic ending; it peters out rather than ending with a bang. Memoirs of a Geisha (120 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for adult themes and sexual innuendo.

Related Culture wars Chinese actresses Japanese roles Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" with Ziyi Zhang Ken Watanabe Michelle Yeoh Gong Li Koji Yakusho Youki Kudoh Kaori Momoi Tsai Chin Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa Suzuka Ohgo. Directed by Rob Marshall from a screenplay by Robin Swicord based on the novel by Arthur Golden. 137 minutes. Rated PG-13 for mature subject matter and some sexual content. Pacific Place. Arthur Goldens 1997 novel ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is an addictive read an involving almost Dickensian tale of a young womans rise from poverty in a fishing village to fame as a Kyoto geisha in the years before World War II and her subsequent fall in fortunes during the war. Told in an engaging first-person voice its details are rich as if a decorous hand is raising a silk curtain to show us a bygone era. The film long in the making is often ravishingly lovely which befits a book in which lavish descriptions of kimonos bloom like flowers throughout the story. But while director Rob Marshall knows what hes doing with color and spectacle (so deftly displayed in the dizzying ""Chicago"") his hand is less sure with drama. The tone too often turns shrill and melodramatic never quite living up to the beauty of its surroundings. This is the rare studio film thats centered on women and Marshall has cast three powerhouses in his leading roles Ziyi Zhang as the title character Sayuri; Michelle Yeoh as her mentor and teacher Mameha; and Gong Li as her scheming nemesis Hatsumomo. (None of this trio of actresses is Japanese causing the film to receive some accusations of cultural insensitivity. But to make the film at this level with this budget Marshall needed big-name stars and Zhang Yeoh and Li are Asian-film royalty. You wonder though whether a smaller-scale Japanese-language version of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" might have had more impact; surely it would have felt more real.) The early scenes of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" are wrenchingly sad as young Sayuri (then called Chiyo and played by child actress Suzuka Ohgo) is sold by her impoverished family and taken to Kyoto a bustling city that looks to her eyes like miles of rooftops. Her less pretty sister is rejected by the geisha house and sent away to the pleasure district and Chiyos attempt to run away ends in injury. She is miserable -- until a brief encounter with a kind man she calls the Chairman (Ken Watanabe) gives her a glimpse of a better life. ""I saw that being a geisha could be a stepping stone to something else a place in his world"" she says in calm voice-over. Schemes are unveiled fans are unfurled and accusations are hurled as Chiyo becomes a young woman changes her name and begins her geisha training. Marshall a former stage director revels in the theatricality of her transformation Its like ""My Fair Lady"" with white powder and kimonos. (The lush fabrics are photographed so lovingly as to create a new genre silk porn.) Mameha a famous geisha with an elegantly husky voice takes Sayuri on as a project but the two must deal with the formidable Hatsumomo who will tolerate no competition. ""I shall destroy you"" she hisses at Sayuri fierce and beautiful as a cat. Lis bitchy role is dispatched with elegant scenery-chewing; Zhang is innocent charm with a spine of steel; while Yeoh glides calmly above the fray a perfectly groomed mother hen. This beautiful movie as it progresses becomes emotionally remote like the geisha at its center it seems to seal off its feelings in favor of a pretty picture. And Marshall too often sacrifices substance for style The choppy editing of a dance sequence (which worked splendidly for the spiky angular choreography of ""Chicago"") feels like its concealing some lack and an assault scene is made more elegant and less disturbing by filming it through a screen. Ultimately ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" compares unfavorably with the book though it offers pleasures of its own. In a season of noisy blockbusters its quiet beauty is refreshing with Zhangs all-too-knowing smile at the end as devastating as any special effect. There is much this geisha knows and will not tell.

Wheres the pained lifelong romantic longing of a woman who pines for the one man to show her kindness after that sale into slavery?All of that was in Arthur Goldens novel. But its not in the movie.Still the director of Chicago working with a pan-Asian cast all forced to deliver lines in labored emotionally drained English captures this lost world of ritualized ""romance"" and women who can ""stop a man in his tracks with a single look."" Geisha is a holiday epic that at least looks the part.In 1920s Japan a mother is dying. The grieving but practical father (Mako) sells his two little girls into an okiya a geisha house in Miyako. The sisters are separated Color Purple fashion. Dont hold your breath waiting for a tearful reunion.Little Chiyo (Suzaka Ohgo) is to be a servant to the house perhaps someday to be sent to geisha school. The cold ""Mother"" of the house (Kaori Momoi) owns her for life. And the houses breadwinner the beautiful headstrong and vindictive Hatsumomo (the great Chinese actress Gong Li) hates her guts.Chiyo is renamed Sayuri when she hits puberty and is played by Ziyi Zhang the Chinese star of House of Flying Daggers. She is sent to geisha school to learn the discipline of the profession how to dance to play an instrument and carry on an intelligent conversation. Japanese gentlemen want that in an escort for the evening a touch of class and a hint of sex.Sayuri is taken under the wing of Mameha played by Michelle Yeoh a great geisha and Hatsumomos great rival. Sayuri goes through geisha rites of passage as the two older women plot to use her to get at one another. And she longs for that next moment in which she sees ""The Chairman"" (Ken Watanabe of The Last Samurai) a man whose moment of kindness when she was 9 has caused her to love him forever.Forever here includes the Japan of the 1920s and 30s through World War II to the American occupation afterward. Thats a lot of ground to cover and the movie doesnt really do that epoch justice.Director Rob Marshall doesnt deliver Sayuris big moments those that show her learning to use her wit and her wiles. Zhang is so knotted up by the English dialogue that her acting suffers. And Watanabe doesnt set off sparks when he strolls into view a Japanese Rhett Butler to this swooning young thing who has set her kimono for him.Gong Li and Yeoh are as riveting as ever even as they fight the same struggle with English that Zhang does.Theres a very good Chinese film about a similarly limited world and the ways a woman learns to cope with it. Raise the Red Lantern starred Gong Li near the beginning of her career and is more majestic more subtle more thoughtful and more emotional as it shows us a woman whose life is by debt and sexist tradition not her own.But Memoirs is still a fascinating glimpse at a lost world of women with skin of porcelain and spines of steel and the men in their thrall.

It is a lush blushingly romantic portrait of Asian culture as seen through a Western lens. Arthur Goldens fictive memoir has been accurately and rapturously transferred to the screen. But the movie is as the novel was -- fake -- and it underscores the problems inherent in forcing American idioms on a foreign culture. Even John Williams score luscious as it is uses Western locutions Itll remind you of Schindlers List. ""We do not become geisha to pursue our own destinies"" says Mameha a wise practitioner of the trade but the films maverick individualism cant hide behind layers of silk or pseudo-Confucian aphorisms. In an American film a line like Mamehas is slapped like a glove across the cheek of the upstart heroine whose unbreakable spirit overcomes all obstacles on the road to self-fulfillment. Youd better believe shell pursue her own destiny. This is America. Memoirs of a Geisha begins with the midnight seizure of 9-year-old Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo) and her sister sold to a trader by their poor fisherman father. Once in Kyoto the girls are separated and Chiyo is peddled to a geisha house where she quickly earns the enmity of the head geisha Hatsumomo (Chinese actress Gong Li). But the little girl has shocking blue eyes and an aqueous nature -- like water she flows around adversity -- and before long shes a student then an apprentice then a full-blown geisha (renamed Sayuri and played as an adult by another Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang) skilled in Japans ancient arts of entertainment. As the film (like the book) makes clear geishas arent prostitutes but hostesses -- women trained to please men through formalized song dance tea ceremonies and other arcane customs. But as the film (like the book) makes clear men sometimes find pleasure elsewhere and its this realm -- the realm of sex and love -- where Sayuri pursues her fate. Taken under wing by Mameha (Michelle Yeoh a Malaysian of Chinese descent) she soon finds her virginity in a bidding war between two clients. But she truly desires a figure of unattainable radiant virtue known only as the Chairman (Ken Watanabe). Watanabe is what can I say a specimen -- a silken dream-man that no geisha could resist. If the romance in Memoirs of a Geisha works any magic it works because Watanabe and Ziyi Zhang are both impossibly beautiful and pine with agonizing reserve Theirs is a most refined frustration. The film glows with the exotic backlight of melodrama from the warm saturation of Dion Beebes cinematography to the persuasive emotional power of its cast. A few observers have complained about this seasons dearth of strong female performances but Memoirs boasts half a dozen easily. If only the screenplay (Robin Swicord and Doug Wright) had more on its mind than love and less on its plate than plot twists; a few scenes might baffle viewers who dont know the book. Director Rob Marshall explored the dark side of feminine lust in Chicago but the difference between those dames and these is more than a matter of sociopathy. The femmes fatales in Chicago took what they wanted men be damned. In Memoirs its the men theyre after. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Nordstrom Rack Clear the Rack Sale Up to 75% off + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post No offense to director Rob Marshall who made such a fine meal of ""Chicago."" But throughout his big-screen version of Arthur Goldens best-selling ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" a question nags What if director Zhang Yimou had taken on this story about a Japanese girl sold into slavery who grows up to be a famed geisha in pre-World War II Japan? After all this period extravaganza stars two of Zhangs leading ladies Ziyi Zhang and Gong Li as rivals Sayuri and Hatsumomo. More important the director of ""House of Flying Daggers"" makes some of the most sumptuous films around. And if not Zhang why not Ang Lee? Ziyi Zhang and Michelle Yeoh who play protege and mentor here starred in Lees groundbreaking ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" Lee is famous for the compassionate reserve he shows his characters. You might think it unfair to pine for what might have been. Culturally biased even. But both directors have a gift for combining the visually bold with the emotionally nuanced. Its an elusive mix that seldom gets its due in Marshalls good-looking but not quite memorable ""Memoirs."" Robin Swicords adaptation hews honorably to Goldens story about country girl Chiyos painful transformation into the famed geisha Sayuri. The film opens on a storm-battered coast where two sisters are taken from their impoverished family. One is sold into a brothel. Chiyo the one with startling eyes the color of water begins her servitude in a geisha house. The wooden house may be run by Mother (Kaori Momoi) but when Chiyo arrives it is lorded over by the stunning Hatsumomo (Gong Li). ""When she was 20 shed already earned her purchase price"" Chiyo is told. ""Unheard of."" Hatsumomos beauty is matched only by her unhappiness and resentment. That a geishas desires are not her own is a theme in ""Memoirs."" Her graceful way of pouring tea her conversation her dance even her virginity may be purchased. But love is not part of the bargain not for her ""danna"" (sugar daddy) not for her. One spring day a handsome businessman two geishas by his side buys Chiyo a treat. Its an act of kindness that produces a magnificent crush and a sense of purpose. Chiyo will become a geisha so she too can travel on the arm of this disarming man. Ken Watanabe (""The Last Samurai"") plays the Chairman. Japanese movie star Koji Yakusho plays his friend and business partner Nobu who will later succumb to Sayuris charms. Cherry blossoms fall. Then snow. The child becomes a teen (Zhang). The lovely geisha Mameha (Yeoh) wheels and deals with Mother for the right to train Chiyo. Chiyos only friend Pumpkin (Youki Kudoh) becomes Hatsumomos lesser apprentice. Let the strategic - and most entertaining - catfight begin. What occurs during and after World War II in the latter third of the film is small-scaled and oddly slow and hurried at the same time compared with Sayuris grand sojourn to the top. The one bright spot comes with the reunion of Sayuri and the war-smartened Pumpkin. The thwarted love story of Sayuri and the Chairman feels like the movies own practiced gesture. Its a lovely come-on but hardly heartfelt. It certainly pales next to the mentor relationship between Memeha and Sayuri or the fiery contest between Sayuri and Hatsumomo two women hemmed into supposedly glamorous but also constricting roles. It was always a daunting task bringing Goldens impressive debut novel to the screen. What was loomed deep into the shimmering fabric of Sayuris tale stays on the pretty surface here. ""Memoirs"" could be retitled ""Pretty Women"" and not because the three female stars bring gorgeous faces and compelling performances in a big old-Hollywood way. Throughout the film geishas make a distinction between their art and the hard labor of their lowly counterparts in brothels. They dont see their bodies they insist. Yes. But another name for ""Memoirs"" comes to mind ""The Best Little Geisha House in Kyoto.""

"Visually dazzling Memoirs falls prey to cliche - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Visually dazzling Memoirs falls prey to cliche By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  December 16 2005 The film version of Memoirs of a Geisha"" is very like a geisha itself a thing of exquisitely refined surfaces beneath which beats an ordinary heart.Arthur Goldens best-selling novel has been brought to the screen with maximum attention to detail -- you could pass out from the kimonos alone -- and if dazzling set design cinematography music and costumes are enough to convince you of greater art proceed forthwith and drink deep. As good as it looks though Memoirs"" remains faux-Oriental chic a Hollywoodized concoction that seems almost calculated to offend Asian audiences and stateside purists. More to the point its commercial compromises cripple it as a movie.But really whats to compromise? Goldens novel is a terrific read that presumes to give an insiders view of World War II-era geisha culture but its written by an outsider -- an American a man a guy from Brookline -- who has essentially laid an expertly researched Japanese screen atop an old-fashioned Gothic romance. If the book is much more than a literary trick it aint exactly The Tale of Genji.""Nor is Rob Marshall (Chicago"") Kenji Mizoguchi the Japanese director whose classic mid-century films about the floating world"" are the real deal. Marshall knows his way around a lavish production though. Both book and film spin the story of Chiyo (played initially by Suzuka Ohgo) a poor fishermans daughter whos sold off in the opening scenes and carted like chattel to Kyoto where shes apprenticed to a geisha house in the Gion entertainment district. The queen of this particular okiya or geisha house is Hatsumomo (Gong Li) an imperiously vicious piece of work who takes one look at Chiyos blue eyes and sees a future rival.The early scenes of Memoirs"" focus on the Dickensian cruelty of Chiyos life -- her attempted escapes Hatsumomos sadistic games -- graced only by the girls encounter with the Chairman (Ken Watanabe The Last Samurai"") a kindly businessman she meets at a low point. Soon Chiyo morphs into adolescence and on comes Ziyi Zhang (2046"" Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"") whose beauty can buckle the knees of a delivery boy at 50 paces.And in sweeps Michelle Yeoh as Mameha kindhearted queen bee of the Gion and archenemy of Hatsumomo. Mameha takes Chiyo on as apprentice and gives her the geisha name of Sayuri but the older woman has a larger game in mind. Yeoh becomes the chief glory of Memoirs"" -- her Mameha is a master strategist with steel nerves hidden under silk and graciousness -- and Sayuri blossoms under her tutelage.Its important to note for those who havent read the book or are ignorant of the culture that geisha were hardly glorified prostitutes. Rather they were social entertainers representing a rarefied ideal of Japanese femininity ornaments as painstakingly constructed as a painted fan. Memoirs"" pays tribute to the geisha obsession with surfaces -- to the opulence that hints at the eros beneath -- while fudging the details to appeal to Western audiences. The movie is a riot of visual sensuousness; its a musical in color and movement and in one rather forced sequence of musical performance itself.At the same time the virginity of young apprentices was sold to the highest bidder and the most successful geisha were those who became mistresses of powerful men. Memoirs"" accepts this state of affairs without commentary. Sayuri pines after the Chairman like Jane Eyre after Rochester while alternately fighting off and acquiescing to the attentions of the Chairmans scarred business partner Nobu (Koji Yakusho) a creepy doctor (Randall Duk Kim) and Mamahas own patron The Baron (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa).A little of this retro romantic martyrdom goes a long way given the films larger problems. There has been controversy over the casting of Chinese and Korean actors in leading roles but if objections are understandable so is the producers desire to sell an already Westernized project to American audiences with known stars. The hard fact is that yes various Asian nationalities do look alike to US multiplex audiences.More ruinous is the decision to shoot Memoirs"" in English. God forbid American moviegoers should be forced to read subtitles but the result is that Zhang Yeoh Gong and Watanabe cant act in their native languages and have to fall back on pidgin dialogue delivered in often-incomprehensible accents. Theyre stellar players robbed of half their tools like a marathon runner with one leg strapped back or a landscape painter wearing an eye patch.This is where Memoirs"" falls short -- again as a movie -- and where it helplessly plays into cliches of the mystical orient"" that the book nimbly sidesteps. Id say go find a video of Mizoguchis 1953 A Geisha"" if you want a more genuine look at the subject but those who will respond to this movie arent interested in the truth. They want the gorgeous lie. If only Memoirs"" lied better. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Bitchery in Geisha. A splendidly intimate Narnia. Slate Sign In Sign Up Bitchery in Geisha. A splendidly intimate Narnia. Bitchery in Geisha. A splendidly intimate Narnia. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateReel TimeRunning thoughts on movies and their makings.Dec. 9 2005 622 PM Kimono Dragons Only the bitchery clicks in Memoirs of a Geisha. Plus a splendidly intimate Narnia. By David Edelstein Small is beautiful Having little to add to Meghan ORourkes eloquent and persuasive examination of C.S. Lewis Narnia books and the authors allegedly overriding Christianity it falls to this resident film critic to say that The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (Touchstone) has been turned into an entertaining emotional and surprisingly intimate movie--an epic saga of fauns and talking (Cockney) beavers and evil sorceresses and triumphal resurrections and massive sweeping battles that nonetheless feels ... small. Advertisement I dont mean that slightingly. The Lion the Witch etc. begins and ends in the imagination of children experiencing a profound loss--in this case a rain of German bombs on London after which the four Pevensie children (Georgie Henley Skander Keynes William Moseley and Anna Popplewell) are exiled (for their own protection) to the country manse of a distant relative. In the absence of a mother and a father (or of any supportive parental figure) in a universe turned upside down the Pevensies enter a world in which--with the aid of a gravely resplendent lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson)--they overcome their earthly fears and desires and fight to vanquish an evil (and vaguely Aryan-Fascist) witch (Tilda Swinton). Theres plenty of busy Lord of the Rings-like sprawl but its the fleeting images that matter most. When little Lucy (Georgie Henley is the most endearing and expressive child actor of the millennium) enters the formidable wardrobe and emerges on the other side of some fur coats into a snow-covered forest its less the setting that captures your imagination. (This isnt one of those fancy Tim Burton-like Expressionist dazzlers.) Its the snowflake on the little girls eyelash. Its Lucys wonder at this place and at the faun (James McAvoy) who befriends her betrays her and then--his conscience getting the best of him--helps her to escape. As directed by Andrew Adamson whose previous directorial credits are for movies that were computer-generated (Shrek and Shrek 2) this is a surprisingly tender and unshowy piece of work. The pacing is leisurely and the atmosphere terribly English--until the big lion-sacrifice scene which has a touch of Mel Gibson-esque cruelty. But then it should shouldnt it? There isnt a trace of humanity in the albino Queen Elizabeth I (or is she Star TreksBorg Queen?) who encases her enemies in ice and smothers the spirit of the land of Narnia with an endless winter--while simultaneously casting out Christmas. (Fascist Liberal) The wrong kind of people (you know who they are) could project a lot of different messages on this fantasy-allegory--right wing left wing fundamentalist (anything but atheist). But like Meghan I prefer to leave its archetypes--well archetypal. For kids and kids-at-heart the best thing about The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is that in spite of its horrific flourishes and occasional brutalities it depicts a fundamentally safe and reassuring universe in which the fallen are healed and no human sin is terrible enough to go unforgiven. And while Darwinism and Christianity have been torn asunder lately by our more obnoxious elements (you know who you are) it is a vision that is profoundly adaptive ... 325 p.m. PST Fasten your obi ... The tale of an orphaned Japanese girl sold into a house of geishas-in-training (it features nasty-taskmaster crones and a reigning--wildly jealous--diva) Arthur Goldens bestselling novel Memoirs of a Geisha should have yielded a transporting movie Dickens in silk kimonos. But as directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) its barely there. Memoirs of a Geisha (Columbia) isnt completely clueless like Alan Parkers cinematic nonevent Angelas Ashes. But like Parkers dud it skips lightly over the surface of its rich material more preoccupied with making pretty pictures than dipping below the surface so that you can experience the world through the eyes of its traumatized yet increasingly savvy heroine. It has been something of a scandal in Asia that the principal actresses are Chinese and Malaysian the idea being that theyre better box-office in international (white) markets than Japanese women and that really Wholl know the difference? And everyone speaks (rather mushy) English anyway. Why look Its the lovely Zhang Ziyi from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers as the grown Sayuri who works her way up from chambermaid to be one of Japans most renowned geishas. In this world of element-based horoscopes Sayuri is supposed to be something of a water spirit (she has blue milky eyes) but Zhang has always struck me as a fire spirit in waifish form. Even with the trickle of water on the soundtrack she seems miscast and so does her sometime co-star the earthy Michelle Yeoh in the role of Sayuris allegedly ethereal geisha tutor. In Goldens book you constantly register the irony that Sayuris rise to power depends on her skill at appearing servile. But with its lickety-split pacing (no image lingers) and romantic John Williams score (what big-budget movie set in Asia is complete without Yo-Yo Ma?) this Memoirs of a Geisha has neither overtones nor undertones. Marshall is a theater guy with a taste for backstage bitchery and the only thing that clicks is the Japanese All About Eve motif--Gong Lis Hatsumomo hissing witchily at poor Sayuri. Rumor has it that Gong learned a lot of her English dialogue phonetically but shes the one member of the cast who speaks with any musicality. That makes sense in a movie that could only have been saved by singing and dancing. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

You wish it were more like a kimono richly woven multilayered and more substantial. Ziyi Zhang is the celebrated geisha Sayuri who performs in Kabuki-style the Winter Dance amid falling snow in Memoirs of a Geisha. Columbia Pictures With its gorgeous cinematography costumes and production design Geisha is a visual feast but it lacks emotional heft and leaves the viewer strangely unsatisfied. Played by an expressive Suzuka Ohgo Chiyo a 9-year-old peasant girl from a fishing village is taken to Kyoto to work in a geisha house in Depression-era Japan. Her indentured servitude is a prelude to becoming a geisha which is still a job in the service industry albeit a more glamorous one. About the movie Memoirs of a Geisha   1/2 (out of four) Stars Ziyi Zhang Ken Watanabe Michelle Yeoh Gong Li Director Rob Marshall Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating PG-13 for mature subject matter and some sexual content Running time 2 hours 25 minutes Opens Friday in New York Los Angeles and San Francisco After she is schooled in the arts of dance tea ceremonies flirtatious conversation and projecting an air of mystery the shy Chiyo is transformed into the alluring and graceful Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang). The exotic grey-eyed beauty is a determined young woman who goes on to become one of the most celebrated geishas of her time. But along the way she must withstand the avarice of ""Mother"" who runs the geisha house and the cruelty and jealousy of Hatsumomo (Gong Li) as well as the indignities of her trade. As a teen her virginity is up for the taking a prize men bid on. She stoically endures this hard life her attitude leavened by the counsel and friendship of her mentor geisha Mameha (Michelle Yeoh). Underlying every action is her secret devotion to a powerful man known as The Chairman (Ken Watanabe). Sayuris voiceover narration underscores this with corny utterances such as ""I would lock away my heart and save it for him."" Based on Arthur Goldens entertaining best seller the movie deviates only slightly from his narrative but it lacks the books haunting power. The dialogue often feels forced and theres a placidity to the pacing and performances that borders on dullness. And the characters lack dimension. Hatsumomo is pure evil promising Sayuri ""I will destroy you"" Mother is the epitome of greed Mameha is kind the Chairman is wise. No one seems to have much depth or complexity so its hard to work up much interest or compassion. Geisha looks rich and appealing but feels static and remote. Substantial effort went into re-creating an authentic look of 1930s-era Japan but not enough attention was given to developing fully realized characters.

The filmmakers find themselves defending their ... more Photo DAVID JAMES REVIEW / Geisha hides its passion behind pretty painted fan 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Memoirs of a Geisha Drama. Starring Ziyi Zhang Ken Watanabe and Michelle Yeoh. Directed by Rob Marshall. (PG-13. 137 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" based on Arthur Golden s novel is very much a holiday movie as the term has come to be defined. It oozes importance is heavy with worthiness and lies there waiting to be appreciated for the beautiful thing it is. Intelligent people will recognize the care and attention that went into its creation and might come away feeling as if theyve been in the presence of art. But they wont feel as if they had a direct experience of art because the film is too labored and the story too overstuffed and cliched to incite passion in an audience. The exoticism of the location the singularity of its world the intricacy of its customs -- director Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") focuses on these elements applies his expert eye brings them to life and then banks on them too much. The subject here is life as a geisha but the story concentrates on the saga of a specific geisha and its a simple story that cant sustain interest in the face of epic treatment and a running time thats about a half-hour too long. The movie needed a lighter hand and less portentous narration. It needed a director and a producing team less intent on making a masterpiece and more intent on just making a good movie. This is not to say that individual elements arent impeccable. Search long and hard and you wont find a more respectable failure. But the movie falls down in the two most important areas It doesnt make the saga of its heroine compelling emblematic or significant. And it makes being a geisha look no more interesting than working at Hooters. Indeed imagine a film about a girl getting a job at Hooters learning how to carry a tray and parry the customers witty comments. Now imagine it set in a romantic past in a far-off culture and the various rivalries among the waitresses for who gets to wear the tightest T-shirt. The result wouldnt be all that different from ""Memoirs of a Geisha."" Like a lot of movies (and people) that go bad the film is best at the beginning. A child of poverty young Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo) is sold to a geisha house and her early life is as tortured as Cinderellas. Shes relegated to housecleaning and told she will never become a geisha. Hatsumomo (Gong Li) one of the star geishas takes an instant disliking toward her and abuses and undermines her at every opportunity. Chiyo experiences only one fleeting moment of kindness when a handsome stranger known as the Chairman (Ken Watanabe) sees her on the street and buys the little girl a flavored ice. If Hatsumomo is the equivalent of a wicked stepsister the Chairman is the handsome prince and Chiyo resolves to grow up to become a geisha and have the Chairman as her danna (patron/sugar daddy). These early scenes present a gripping situation and vivid characters. As the evil geisha Gong Li is fascinating in that her treatment of Chiyo seems compulsive deriving from a weird mix of fear and self-loathing. Young Chiyo is a prisoner and her plight is brought home with particular force by the casting of Ohgo an 11-year-old actress gifted with an adults intensity and emotional readiness. Shes also lovely and the shot in which she finally smiles -- during her chance encounter with the kind Chairman -- is the most memorable in the film. But then she grows up. Chiyo is renamed Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) and comes under the tutelage of a benevolent older geisha played by Michelle Yeoh and the rest of the movie traces Sayuris emergence as a geisha her tribulations and her never-ending longing for the Chairman. The movie becomes bloated giving us a crash course in geisha artistry and customs as well as a tour through the history of Japan in the 1930s and 194os as seen through a geishas eyes. But the personal dimension of the film loses all impact. For all the movies focus on Sayuris professional striving it doesnt make much of a case for why geisha-hood is worth achieving. At best it looks like a lonely degraded existence so who cares if she succeeds or not? Even worse Sayuris unrequited passion for the Chairman begins to seem like a story construct. Its just something to hold the audiences attention while the movie concentrates on other things -- such as peasant life and customs during World War II. -- Advisory Sexual situations.

Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director Rob Marshall. With Ziyi Zhang Ken Watanabe Michelle Yeoh. (137 min.)Beautiful geishas flit and whoosh through the equally beautiful scenery. Their kimonos are artworks-in-motion. So why is the film so boring? It could be because director Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") is so transfixed by all the ritualistic hoo-ha that he never brings the story down to earth.Beginning in the years before World War II its about a poor country girl Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) who becomes the geisha equivalent of a supermodel. But she pines for the baron (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who once did her a good turn when she was a 9-year-old and whom she still has a thing for as an adult. This plot development is a bit freakier than Marshall would have us believe. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Sayuris specialty snowflake dance in 12-inch platform heels is the kind of exertion that upsets Hatsumomo (Gong Li) Sayuris nemesis. The only fun I had at this movie was seeing these two ladies catfight. Its a great cineaste in-joke if one bears in mind that Gong Li was once the muse of the great Chinese director Zhang Yimou and now that job belongs to Ziyi Zhang.

Its not a great movie or even a particularly good one but its spectacular. No expense has been spared. The technical crew reads like a roll call of Oscar-night regulars. The music is by John Williams with violin solos by Itzhak Perlman Yo-Yo Ma on cello. And after a while the movie wears you down -- you surrender to its elegant upholstery right along with its convictions that all Asian people look alike and that pre-WWII Kyoto was a dead ringer for the Japanese Pavilion at Epcot Center. Im tempted to call Memoirs of a Geisha a guilty pleasure but really its closer to a guilty acquiescence. Adapted by Robin Swicord from the best-selling novel by the improbable Arthur Golden (a Chattanooga-born Harvard-educated historian) Memoirs begins in 1929 and follows the Dickensian fortunes of 9-year-old Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo) a poor country girl whose destitute father sells her off to an okiya (or geisha house) separating her from her beloved older sister (who is sold to a rival house). Scraggly and scrawny and unabashedly homesick Chiyo hardly seems the stuff that geisha are made of and so finds herself consigned to veritable slavery in the service of the okiyas stern owner (known only as Mother) and its reigning star the vain and calculating Hatsumomo (Gong Li). That is until young Chiyo catches the attention of an influential Osaka factory owner called the Chairman (Ken Watanabe) and in short order receives a visit from the regal Mameha (Michelle Yeoh). A legend among geisha (and Hatsumomos archnemesis) Mameha makes Mother a monetary offer she cant refuse which allows her to take the seemingly hopeless Chiyo under her wing.Chiyos odyssey parallels that of another famous literary urchin -- even if Cinderella preferred glass slippers to wooden sandals and didnt at least as I recall have her virginity auctioned off to the highest bidder. Under Mamehas watchful eye Chiyo (renamed Sayuri and now played by Ziyi Zhang) is transformed from naif to knockout and no sooner has she made her professional debut than she becomes the most sought-after geisha in town earning the ire of Hatsumomo and further attention from the chairman. He loves Sayuri from afar but keeps his affection well-hidden out of deference to his friend and business partner the disfigured Nobu (Koji Yakusho) who also pines for Sayuri and to whom the Chairman literally owes his life.That setup becomes fodder for one of those unduly protracted movie love stories in which it takes the guy and girl who are clearly perfect for each other two-plus hours to realize that and to gradually find their way back to one another. (Call it Cold Mount Fuji.) And for most of Memoirs of a Geisha I kept wondering whether this paperback-romance glop was ever going to deepen into something more meaningful. It doesnt and yet I nevertheless found myself falling for the movies intoxicating charms -- chief among them Zhang whose porcelain skin and watery blue-gray eyes are repeatedly filmed in screen-filling close-up and who possesses the pantomimic expressiveness of the great silent-film stars. To watch emotions flash across her face is to behold a calm sea momentarily disturbed by the ripples of a skipped stone. Its the kind of performance that can make the material seem richer than it actually is. And its all the more remarkable in that Zhang like much of the primary Geisha cast is far from a fluent English speaker.The appeal of the film lies mainly in the actors -- not just Zhang but Gong vamping to the hilt in the de facto wicked-stepsister role her every glance like a dagger encased in silk; and Yeoh resplendent and proud yet not quite so above it all that she doesnt feel a tinge of jealousy at her star pupils meteoric ascendancy. If rumors are to be trusted these three divas were hardly the best of friends during the making of the film and any such competitiveness can only have enhanced the storys backbiting tone. When Hatsumomo tells Sayuri that she will destroy her theres a special relish to her words that transcends any language barrier and its a promise she nearly makes good on during a knock-down drag-out cat fight that ranks alongside the best of Joan Collins and Linda Evans. But the men in the film are no slouches particularly Watanabe (trading The Last Samurais Yul Brynner routine for Clark Gables Brylcreem elan) and Yakusho who invests what might have been a stock wounded-war-vet role with unexpectedly tender and tragic dimensions.Director Rob Marshall has picked up a great deal of skill since his feature directorial debut Chicago an abomination that somehow manages to maintain the reputation of being a good movie. Marshalls still a director who makes Ron Howard seem like a fount of forceful personality. He lacks any real affinity for the language of film but at least hes learned where to put the camera and how to cut a scene together. No doubt it helped that Steven Spielberg who produced Geisha long planned to direct the film himself and spent considerable time prepping the production. Its not hard to see what appealed to Spielberg about the material -- it has the same reductive-masquerading-as-empowering view of ""ethnic people"" that has plagued a number of his own films and early on I wondered if the whole thing might end with Sayuri reunited with her sister and playing patty-cake in the streets of Kyoto while atomic bombs rain down on the rest of Japan.To their credit Marshall and Swicord keep things from going in that direction even if they also show precious little genuine curiosity about the real social fabric of the Far East. Then again thats not really the point. Memoirs of a Geisha is about as Japanese as those folding screens they sell in the housewares department at Kmart (which like most of Geishas cast are made in China). Its an unrepentantly artificial package a bejeweled Oriental fantasia constructed on a series of Culver City sound stages and some Ventura County ranch land a tribute to exquisite (and exquisitely phony) Hollywood craftsmanship. (The only thing missing is a cameo by the late Pat Morita perhaps as a comical rickshaw driver.) To that end Geisha is much more of a musical than Chicago ever was up to and including the hypnotizing dance routine performed by Sayuri -- in sky-high platform sandals during an indoor snowstorm -- on her first night as a geisha. No wonder the Chairman says that even the cherry blossoms are jealous of her. And we have no trouble believing him.

Forbidden to whom? As fragile as what? The movie directed by Rob Marshall with the same mass marketers eye for shiny surfaces that he brought to Chicago and written by Little Womens Robin Swicord arrives with refined manners and good breeding in a rustle of silk kimonos just in time for consideration during the middlebrow prestige-awards season. Its bound to win some. Its also a cinch to boost the sale of tie-in fashions and cosmetics. But not since Snow Falling on Cedars have I seen so pedigreed a lit-pic sit there like such an inert teapot available only to be admired for its mysterious ineffable Asian teapotness. The story traces Sayuris rise from a poor strikingly blue-eyed peasant girl called Chiyo sold by her family into geishadom (with much throat-clearing explanation of the differences between the artistry of geishas and the tartistry of common prostitutes) to become the reigning artiste of her day. And in the beginning the picture rushes forward (with none of the books dawdling educational chitchat) on promising streams of tears pouring from young Chiyo (played with arresting feistiness by newcomer Suzuka Ohgo) and rivers of rainwater gushing from the recurring motif of Sayuris elementally watery adaptable nature. But just after the first unsettling moment of sexual tension -- when the weeping rebellious little girl meets the much older gentleman known only as the Chairman (Ken Watanabe) who would become the secret object of her strangled grown-up affections -- Memoirs loses its taste for risk and settles throughout the movies subsequent melodramatic turns for the familiar blandishments of good looks and technical control. Once Zhang appears in all her gorgeous porcelain opacity the sad woman renamed Sayuri defies any further emotional penetration and the movie follows suit an imitation of life. And there it remains stoppered up even while the old Japanese empire falls and traditions of chasteness give way to a coarser time. (In the unsubtle role of Pumpkin Cedars star Youki Kudoh represents the bad new population of westernized modern Asian women.) As Sayuri trains her powers she is instructed by a mentor (Michelle Yeoh) and schemed against by a rival; in one girl-girl battle shes clawed at by her nemesis Hatsumomo played in a shrieky fit of Geisha Dearest by the great diva Gong Li; apparently it takes a village of Chinese movie stars to play Japanese women. Hairpins fly and obis go awry in this sleek production. And yet inscrutably no one and nothing gets touched.

"Memoirs of a Geisha | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; memoirs-of-a-geisha ) Memoirs of a Geisha (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a recognized fact that many epic love stories of literature and cinema transpire around or during a war. Consider for example Casablanca (World War II) Gone with the Wind (the American Civil War) Dr. Zhivago (the Russian Revolution) and Pearl Harbor (just kidding). Memoirs of a Geisha falls into this category. At its heart this is a romance that transpires against the background of an ever-changing Japan during the 1930s and 1940s. Although the film is less concerned with the war than with the impact it has upon the characters much of the final act could not have occurred without the influence of the postwar American occupation of Japan. Memoirs of a Geisha spent a lot of time in development hell before finally getting the green light. At one time Steven Spielberg was set to direct (he remains on board as a producer). Several other names came and went until the producers settled on Rob Marshall (Chicago). But because Marshall was under contract to Miramax some horse trading had to be done before he was free to make the movie. The film is an adaptation of the immensely popular Arthur Golden novel and is about as faithful as a two-plus hour movie could be. Theres no doubting that Memoirs of a Geisha is a lush motion picture and it has much to recommend it but this will not go down as one of the great screen romances of the 2000s. The love story although competently told never soars and while satisfying it doesnt cause the heart either to break or take flight. One could argue that the movie is more about the lead character than her relationship with a man but by the way the story is told its clear than Marshall and his screenwriters want the romance to be a key element. The film opens with Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo as a child Ziyi Zhang as an adult) being taken from the small fishing village of Yoroido and sold to the proprietress of a Kyoto geisha house. At first Chiyos lone goal is to find her sister Satsu from whom she has been separated but after a brief reunion they are parted forever. Chiyos plans to become a geisha - a ""moving work of art"" who sells her skills not her body - are dashed when she runs afoul of Hatsumomo (Gong Li) the houses most consistent earner. For her infractions she is denied the chance to attend the geisha school and must perform menial chores. But others see something in her. The Chairman (Ken Watanabe) recognizes her as a girl of amazing character and offers her a simple kindness. Chiyo vows to become a geisha and make him her patron. A celebrated geisha Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) takes Chiyo under her wing. When Chiyo is ready to make her debut she is given a ""geisha name"" - Sayuri - and introduced into society where she must compete with Hatsumomo for the best clients. The need for the film to be commercially viable is a drawback. Admittedly the purist approach - all Japanese actors speaking in subtitled dialogue - while arguably the best way to present Memoirs of a Geisha would have resulted in a box-office disaster. So to broaden the films appeal ""name"" Asian actors were chosen and the movie was made in English. Three of the major actresses - Ziyi Zhang (Chinese) Gong Li (Chinese) and Michelle Yeoh (Malaysian) - are not Japanese. Their ethnicity isnt really an issue since most Westerners wont know the difference. However the decision for all the dialogue to be in English is more problematic. Zhang and Gong are not adept at this language and their delivery and cadence is frequently off. Both are excellent actresses but they dont shine here except in instances when scenes rely on the non-verbal aspects of their performances. Michelle Yeoh is more comfortable with English and this makes her a standout. To Marshalls credit he assembled as many Japanese actors as possible. Youki Kudoh (Snow Falling on Cedars) is solid as Pumpkin Sayuris sometimes-friend sometimes-rival. Kaori Momoi plays the crotchety landlady of the geisha house. KAji Yakusho gives a passionate performance as the scarred Nobu. And Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) exudes nobility as the Chairman. The only non-Asian to have a speaking role of any significance is Paul Adelstein and his part requires less than 15 minutes of screen time. Like The Joy Luck Club this is a rarity - a motion picture made in the United States with an almost all-Asian cast. For those who follow Asian cinema theres a note of irony surrounding Gong Lis appearance in this film. The actress first gained the international spotlight for her work in the superb Raise the Red Lantern in which she played an innocent preyed upon by older more cunning women. In Memoirs of a Geisha the tables are turned. In this instance its Gong whos the seasoned nastier woman. The actress playing her victim Ziyi Zhang is the woman who took up with Gongs ex-lover Zhang Yimou after Zhang and Gong underwent a traumatic and public breakup in 1995. Its not surprising how sumptuous the movie looks or how rich it is in atmosphere. During the early scenes as Sayuri and her sister are taken from their homes and separated the films tone and mood are perfect. Its Dickens filtered through Japan. Later scenes are equally well developed. Marshalls primary aim seems to have been to make Memoirs of a Geisha look right. Im not an expert on World War II era Japan but the period detail appears to be on the mark. John Williams score which has a suitably Japanese flavor complements the visual elements. Emotionally although Memoirs of a Geisha is not inert it lacks the ability to wrench the viewer. There are times when it feels muted. The story offers insight into what geishas were in the ""old"" Japan (""not courtesans not wives"") and the ""new"" one (""anyone can buy a kimono and call herself a geisha"") and by extension the kind of seismic shift undergone by Japanese culture after the war. The central love story is more complex in the book but Marshall distills it to its essence so the resolution is defined for cinema-goers. Memoirs of a Geisha is worthwhile on many levels although it lacks the depth of feeling that would have elevated it from a good movie to a romance for the ages.

The mysterious world opened up to readers by Arthur Goldens international best-seller has been moved to the bigscreen with beauty and tact in ""Memoirs of a Geisha."" Long-gestating project may seem like a risky one for an expensive studio venture given the virtually all-Asian cast but the combo of the subjects exoticism the knockout trio of lead actresses and book-built interest should be enough to lure substantial audiences internationally to what is underneath it all a conventional Cinderella story. On a picture exec producer Steven Spielberg long intended to direct himself Rob Marshall follows his smash ""Chicago"" debut with a consummate piece of traditional studio craftsmanship that bespeaks fastidious planning and execution in all departments. From a filmmaking point of view this is a work that the old Hollywood moguls themselves would have been proud to present. Despite its refined nature ""Geisha"" is mainstream rather than highbrow fare and reception among the intelligentsia may be negatively affected by the casting of famous Chinese thesps Ziyi Zhang Michelle Yeoh and Gong Li as the three celebrated pre-WWII Japanese geisha no matter how good they are in the picture. Issue also leaves open the question of audience response in Japan where the film opens Dec. 10 the day after its domestic release and where Gong and Zhang are exceptionally popular. There are arguments to be made on both sides but this is more a fable than a realistic picture and Asian audiences for decades have accommodated generalized ""oriental"" casting in Hollywood pics. Outside of Asia most viewers could care less and theres no denying that you dont want to take your eyes off these actresses for a second. Hewing faithfully to the general lines if not all the specifics of the 1997 novel script by Robin Swicord boasts a well-carpentered three-act structure framed by sensitive narration in which the mature geisha Sayuri looks back on her life and a world quickly disappearing. In fact this narration (by Shizuko Hoshi) helps the picture make it over the tricky language hurdle by serving as a graceful English-lingo bridge between a childhood prologue which is performed in Japanese and subsequent action in which two sisters from a remote fishing village their mother dying are sent by an elderly father to live in bustling Gion district of Kyoto. Evaluated for suitability at an okiya -- or geisha household -- by an imperious woman known as Mother (a fabulously crusty Kaori Momoi) the older sister is turned away. Nine-year-old Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo) who has unusual deep gray eyes is retained to join another girl Pumpkin doing menial tasks with the prospect of one day being trained to be a geisha. Ruling the roost at the cramped compound is Hatsumomo (Gong Li). Exceptionally beautiful she is also arrogant and tempestuous -- a diva among geisha who gives Chiyo a hard time from the outset. Her one weakness is men with whom she lustily consorts in ways inappropriate to her highly defined role in life. After Chiyo spots her in a passionate clinch with a man Mother berates Hatsumomo with ""Do you think a geisha is free to love? Never"" Perhaps the greatest fascination of Goldens heavily researched novel is its illumination of classical geisha mores beginning with the clarification (for Westerns at least) of whether or not they are prostitutes. While necessarily not as detailed as the novel the film follows in this line explaining that geisha are elegant companions and practitioners of traditional arts expert at maintaining agreeable decorum and emotional restraint. Act one closes with Chiyos chance street encounter with a debonair businessman simply called the Chairman (Ken Watanabe) who inspires her to become a geisha. At the 40-minute mark action jumps ahead to the mid-1930s. Chiyo (now played by Ziyi Zhang) is 15 and still the house slave when the sophisticated Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) Hatsumomos only rival as the most celebrated geisha in Kyoto makes a financial deal with Mother to school the budding beauty to become a geisha. This alliance officially pits Chiyo against Hatsumomo who takes Pumpkin as her protege and demands she never speak to her best friend again. Tension in the okiya rise to impossible levels as Hatsumomo plots to subvert the gorgeous girl she fears will threaten her own popularity. But Mameha lays a careful plan for her students ascent one that includes Chiyos -- now renamed Sayuri -- debut as a dancer (a triumph) and the auctioning of her virginity (it brings a record bid). All of this brings Sayuri into influential circles that include the Chairman and his business associate Nobu (Koji Yakusho) a facially scarred man who would like to become Sayuris danna or patron. When Sayuri emerges like a butterfly from a cocoon as a full-fledged geisha a showdown with Hatsumomo becomes inevitable. This middle section is the most absorbing as it presents the classical geisha world in what turned out to be its final full blossom. The viewer is pulled willingly through Sayuris learning process and is provided with a rooting interest in response to Hatsumomos treachery. Set pieces including the dance performance and a visit to a sumo wrestling contest are arresting and there is a bracing jolt whenever the action leaves the dark cloistered interiors to move into the maze-like streets of the hanamachi or geisha district superbly recreated in John Myhres infinitely detailed production design. Third act telescopes the impact of World War II down to the disruptions it causes in the central characters lives as the women are dispersed into the countryside for safety. After Japans defeat Sayuri returns from the rice paddies to reunite with Mameha in a Kyoto teeming with American soldiers. Nobu and the Chairman emerge from the rubble to enlist the womens help in securing a big business deal with the Yanks which sets the stage for Sayuris highly dramatic final reckonings with the two men. As conventionally pleasing as the ending may be however pics too-pat version of it leaves unanswered many questions that are dealt with in the novel with a bittersweet embrace of reality. While scarcely a meditative work such as a Japanese director might have made on the subject ""Geisha"" is fortunately a much calmer movie than ""Chicago"" one with steady dramatic focus and a confident narrative rhythm. The rules and formality of the world under scrutiny may have been contagious to the filmmakers as there is a welcome sense of composure and orderliness to the enterprise that avoids gimmickry and trendiness. Craft contributions are of a very high order. Right down to the exterior light the film is convincing in its physical details despite the fact it was mostly shot in California on Sony soundstages in Culver City and on locations throughout the state (a few Japanese locales were used as well). Colleen Atwoods dazzling costumes particularly the ornate kimono play an unusually central visual role as do the makeup and hairstyles. John Williams excellent score is dominated by Japanese instrumentations abetted by Western-style thematic work soulfully played by cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Itzhak Perlman. As for the actresses coached to speak English with Japanese accents the fact is there are no Japanese female stars at the moment with anything approaching the charisma stature and international celebrity of Zhang Gong and Yeoh. In the leading role Zhang is convincing and mesmerizingly beautiful even if there is an intangible missing from her dialogue delivery in English that gives her somewhat less impact here than she had in her virtuoso performance in Wong Kar-wais recent ""2046."" Gong rightly pulls out all the stops as the flamboyant geisha queen desperate to stay on her throne giving her perf a delicious melodramatic spin that puts one in mind of Bette Davis or Joan Crawford in their primes. Comparatively benefiting from her complete fluency in English Yeoh excels endowing Mameha with a cool intelligence th at masks the protracted uncertainty of her all-or-nothing bet on Sayuris future. Japanese thesp Kudoh makes for a wonderful Pumpkin coming into her own in the third act. The Japanese actors including Watanabe as the reserved Chairman who looms distantly but decisively over Sayuris life Yakusho as her restrained admirer and Japanese-American Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as an opportunistic industrialist are solid in roles that are strictly one-dimensional compared to those of the women. A thoughtful old-fashioned touch in the end credits matches the performers names with their images.
