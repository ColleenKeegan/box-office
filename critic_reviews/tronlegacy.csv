Rated PG (some intense action) BOTTOM LINE Like the 1982 original long on visuals and short on story making for a nifty-looking bore. CAST Jeff Bridges Garrett Hedlund Olivia Wilde WHEN/WHERE ""Tron Legacy"" showtimes and tickets LENGTH 206 Way back in 1982 before phones got smart and books lost their spines Walt Disney Productions released ""Tron"" an early attempt to visualize a world inside a computer - what wed now call virtual reality. Making unprecedented use of computer-generated effects the movie created a new landscape of grids planes and pixels. It was ambitious cutting-edge and unfortunately pretty boring. Nearly 30 years later the sequel is hoping to prove its not your fathers ""Tron."" advertisement | advertise on newsday There is a strong family resemblance. In the original programmer Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) was laser-beamed into a mainframe and forced to compete in arcade-style games to survive. The sequel ""Tron Legacy"" follows Flynns son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) as he searches for his father in the circuitry. But my how the cyber-world has changed. Now its filled with trendy architecture designer women and fashionable ideas (""a system where all information was free""). Bridges again plays Flynn in laid-back Dude mode but the actor has more fun doubling as the evil cyber-tyrant Clu. Hedlunds Sam gets to drive the glowing lightcycles make eyes at punky-haired Quorra (Olivia Wilde) and hang out in a cyber-club with the flamboyant Castor (Michael Sheen stealing the show). Look up in the DJ booth Its the French electro-duo Daft Punk who scored the film. Like the original ""Tron Legacy"" obsesses over technology and style but forgets important details like character and plot. The reason it already looks dated is because its timeless elements are missing.

"TRON Legacy review Jeff Bridges animates a return to the neon computer world of 1982 |       NJ.com comments TRON Legacy review Jeff Bridges animates a return to the neon computer world of 1982 Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 17 2010 at 801 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1108 AM View/Post Comments (MCT)Beau Garrett left and Garrett Hedlund in ""Tron Legacy."" If you were born around 1970 and grew up sporting a Casio digital watch totally rocking Ms. Pac-Man and all but sleeping with your Commodore 64 you remember ""Tron."" That was the 1982 Disney film that had games guru Jeff Bridges ""digitized"" and trapped inside a computer -- where he explored cyber-reality and had dangerous neon Frisbee fights. Although all that was pretty cool if you were an 11-year-old geek the movie was not a hit with the masses. But this is now 2010 and the geeks have inherited the earth. So here comes an enormous expensive belated sequel ""TRON Legacy"" to warm your memory chips. (Although good luck finding the original -- its oddly unavailable on DVD suggesting the studio doesnt want you drawing any unflattering comparisons). And admitted the new ""TRON"" looks great. Tricked out in IMAX and 3D its a trippy fun-ride. Diagrams turn into objects and objects disintegrate into glittering shards; the depth illusion isnt used merely to make things come at you but to have characters slip in and out of different levels. Its yet another step forward for 3D and computer-generated effects. Movie Review TRON Legacy (PG) Disney (126 min.) Directed by Joseph Kosinski. With Garrett Hedlund Jeff Bridges Olivia Wilde. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains endless but bloodless violence. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS For human-generated effects ... er not so much. The story has Sam the grown son of the first films Kevin Flynn entering his dads bizarro computer world. There he finds his missing father in two versions -- his own aged self and Clu an evil eternally youthful completely computerized version. But Garrett Hedlund who plays Sam may be the least exciting young actor in a sci-fi epic since Hayden Christensen in ""Star Wars Episode II -- Attack of the Clones."" And the digitally created Clu -- played by a digitally enhanced Jeff Bridges -- looks like a Macys mannequin. Bridges is a lot more fun as the older version partly because he looks like himself. Also because the character has been conceived as a sort of burned-out mystic padding around in yoga pants and telling someone off with an angry ""Youre messing with my Zen thing man"" Yes its the byte Lebowski. But Hedlund is still a pretty-boy bore (the only unintentionally amusing thing about his character is that the script -- from the perpetually trademark-obsessed Disney empire -- presents his copyrights-be-damned hacking as heroic). The only interesting thing about his love interest Olivia Wilde is her asymmetrical haircut. Meanwhile unlike ""Inception"" which made you work for your fun the muddled script just makes you work. Kevins occasional unearthly powers an oddly campy ""program"" who runs a nightclub a genocidal war against a race of living algorithms -- this is a story fueled not so much by ideas as by ideas for ideas. Perhaps all this is enough to rekindle some fond memories in nostalgic nerds. And it is genuinely exciting to see where this brave new world of CGI and 3D is leading. But on the whole this isnt really much of a legacy -- or even as much fun as a round of Space Invaders.

ABOUT THE MOVIETRON Legacy  out of four Stars Jeff Bridges Garrett Hedlund Olivia Wilde Bruce Boxleitner Michael SheenDirector Joseph KosinskiDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG for sequences of mild sci-fi action violence and brief mild languageRunning time 2 hours 7 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The lead character in TRON Legacy is urged to have patience. ""All your questions will be answered soon"" he is told. But for those in the audience its best to just sit back drink in its virtual dazzle and not ask questions. The story is beside the point in this sleek-looking reboot. Its all about the whiz-bang special effects and the return of Jeff Bridges -- always the coolest guy in any space cyber or otherwise. For those nostalgic for the 1982 original Bridges has a familiar youthful incarnation. Though this sequel has visual motifs reminiscent of Blade Runner and Star Wars and The Matrix its rarely as coherent as those films. Like its predecessor which was celebrated for its pioneering computer graphics this new TRON is glossy. But its story is impenetrable often nonsensical. Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) is the handsome 27-year-old loner son of visionary inventor Kevin Flynn (Bridges). The elder Flynn vanished on the verge of a big discovery two decades before. Meanwhile Sam has come to believe his dad is ""either dead or chilling in Costa Rica or both."" Theres plenty more similarly unimaginative even obfuscating dialogue. TRAILER Enter the world of TRON INTERVIEW Star Olivia Wilde TRON GALAXY Special effects then and now Sam probes his fathers disappearance and is sucked into the same computerized world as the one his father invented. He plunges into cyberspace and a gladiator contest involving the high-tech super-speed Frisbees TRON fans will remember from the first film. Sam is an unlikely user thrust into a world of programs and must fend off the evil Clu (played by a computer-enhanced Bridges looking essentially as he did in 1982). Fortunately the cutting-edge visuals and an exciting motorcycle chase compensate somewhat for TRONs listless man-vs.-machine story line. The 3-D is effective but not jaw-dropping. The pounding repetitive score by Daft Punk intensifies the dully ominous mood. Though fierce-looking transportation devices materialize out of thin air the path they race off on is predictable. For some reason Kevins lair is minimalistic white and sterile-looking more Sleeper than sci-fi. The story trips up substantially as it unfolds with a scenery-chewing performance by Michael Sheen as Castor/Zuse an androgynous club owner who looks to be channeling early David Bowie. His turn is meant as comic relief but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring. Olivia Wilde plays the wise Quorra and provides a dully low-key but wide-eyed potential love interest for Sam. Mostly shes a really good driver. Bridges pops off with a litany of Dude-like remarks from ""Far out"" to ""Youre messing with my Zen thing man"" prattling on about ""digital jazz"" and making incomprehensible mystical pronouncements like ""Im going to knock on the sky."" He speaks so glowingly about free information you expect him to assert he invented the Internet. Most of the story just doesnt scan. In this virtual world Kevin has a shelf of rare old books and somehow rustles up a suckling pig to serve to his son for a celebratory dinner. But picking apart specifics as we warned is futile. For a far more thought-provoking tale about the virtual realm try The Social Network. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Disney Beau Garrett (left) and Garrett Hedlund in ""TRON Legacy"" (Disney) Olivia Wilde and Garrett Hedlund in ""TRON Legacy"" (Disney) I dont know a joystick from a jalopy so if a movie is trying to replicate the experience of playing a video game Im not the best person to judge.Strike 2 Ive never the seen original ""TRON"" which was a costly flop in 1982 but has developed a cult following. So I say this as an admittedly rather old newbie The long-delayed sequel ""TRON Legacy"" looks cool (as in cold) but its about as much fun as being a barrel in a game of ""Donkey Kong.""From what Ive read on papyrus scrolls the original ""TRON"" was about a computer programmer named Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who invents and enters a video game in which motorcyclists race to the death along a grid pattern. In this sequel Flynns now-grown son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) laments the loss of his father but hed rather race his (real) motorcycle than run the family business. But then a mysterious message on an antiquated pager directs Sam to his fathers abandoned video arcade where 80s arena rock is still thumping behind the locked doors. There Sam is zapped into the virtual grid and hurled into a cutthroat game of frisbee jai alai -- the first of many challenges against cyber foes in color-coded latex suits.Presiding over the games is an overlord who looks like a young version of Sams father but actually is CLU a computer program that craves perfection. (Note to Hollywood The age-reversal trick is not quite ready for its close-up.) Sam is rescued from the cyber samurai by a racer babe named Quorra (Olivia Wilde). She takes him to the minimalist man-cave of her master (in both the boss and the Buddhist sense) the now-aged Kevin Flynn (Bridges) who has been imprisoned in the virtual world by his creation CLU. The father-and-son reunion ought to be the emotional crossroads of the story but debut director Joseph Kosinski zips right past it. He also fumbles a David Bowie-esque performance by Michael Sheen as the grids Mr. Fix-It and allusions to movies from ""Star Wars"" to ""The Big Lebowski.""Kosinski whose background is in commercials seems interested only in the 3-D special effects blue decor and deafening techno soundtrack (by Daft Punk).Its a triumph of streamlined design but ""TRON Legacy"" never enters the fourth dimension where its worth a plugged nickel to humans.

With Garrett Hedlund Jeff Bridges Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen Watch Clips From Tron Legacy - I Was Paged I Was Paged Credit Walt Disney Pictures From Tron Legacy - Long Time Long Time Credit Walt Disney Pictures From Tron Legacy - Im Quorra Im Quorra Credit Walt Disney Pictures When Disney announced it was planning to make a sequel to Tron its 1982 imagining of a dystopia existing in our computers circuit boards the news was greeted enthusiastically by that films small and adoring cult. But for many the move was a head-scratcher a 200 million budget handed to a director Joseph Kosinski whod only ever worked in commercials to make a 28-years-later sequel to a visually groundbreaking (but narratively dull) sci-fi flick that was only a modest success in its original release. The good news for that cult is that Tron Legacy serves up similarly astonishing sights. Everyone else may continue scratching their heads for the story here is just as spotty as in the films predecessor. The filmmakers offer a brief prologue to refresh the memory after the three-decade break. In 1989 original Tron hero Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges digitally altered to appear closer to 40 than 60) tells his young son Sam a bedtime story about how he managed to digitize himself and enter the world within the computer -- and how through his ongoing entrances into that digital realm hes on the verge of revolutionizing artificial intelligences as we know them. He leaves it at that heads off to work and disappears. Jump to the present day and Sam (Garrett Hedlund) is a headstrong computer genius without much use for authority just like Dad. His strongest qualities seem to be rebellion riding motorcycles at high speed and staring sullenly over the water from the industrial garage hes converted into a home. But a mysterious message leads him to his fathers old arcade where he winds up falling into the same digital world that swallowed his father. For those viewing the film in 3-D this is where the screen gets some depth; Kosinski steals a page from The Wizard of Oz using three dimensions only once we arrive in Sams equivalent of the colorized Oz. Once there the director uses the medium elegantly and without cheap 3-D gimmickry. i Jeff Bridges plays Kevin Flynn who has been trapped for two decades by the artificial intelligence he created. Disney Enterprises Inc. hide caption toggle caption Disney Enterprises Inc. Jeff Bridges plays Kevin Flynn who has been trapped for two decades by the artificial intelligence he created. Disney Enterprises Inc. What Sam finds is a fascist world ruled by Clu the artificially intelligent program his father created to run the place with his father trapped in exile ""off the grid."" Bridges plays both roles though his Clu is digitally altered to remain young. (The character represents an impressive advancement in rendering humans digitally but its still lacking enough to be vaguely creepy.) The most problematic part of both Trons old and new is the uneasy juxtaposition of two genres with conventions as distinct as the two worlds of the movie. On the one hand this new outing wants to be dark moody science fiction full of Big Ideas. But its also ostensibly a kids movie by a kids studio so its obligated to stage the races and battles that audience demands. The result is an experience akin to trying to meditate on a roller coaster -- which may explain why Flynn while trapped inside seems to have become a kind of digital surfer bodhisattva appending the word ""man"" to his sentences and doling out Zen proclamations like ""Im gonna go knock on the sky and listen to the sound."" (Even in Tronworld it seems the Dude abides.) If that sounds a little ridiculous well it is. Tron Legacy revels in its over-the-top nature the sharp contrast of inky blacks against vibrant neons the bombastic clash of orchestral and synthetic elements in the soundtrack (by French electronic musicians Daft Punk) the trippy sometimes incoherent ideas it presents. But the filmmakers also arent above poking fun at their own excesses When Michael Sheen steals the show in a campy turn as a Bowie-esque cyberpunk club owner -- whos albino no less -- youd swear hes winking at the camera. Still its a fun scene and despite all the gloom and grandiosity this can be a fun movie particularly for those willing to sit back and let it wash over them. View it through the same nostalgia-colored glasses with which cultists apparently see the first film and this new one may fire on all the same cylinders. But for those whose glasses render only the 3-D it may look a little shallow.

"Tron Legacy with Jeff Bridges reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Tron Legacy with Jeff Bridges reviewed. Tron Legacy with Jeff Bridges reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 16 2010 721 PM Tron Legacy I would rather be bombarded with neon Frisbees than watch this movie again. By Dana Stevens Tron The idea to make a sequel to the 1982 movie Tron--which was a hit neither with most critics nor with the public and which has amassed at best a campy cult following among a niche of gamers and sci-fi fans--is an arrogant overestimation of the originals value. The grandiose hype for Tron Legacy (Disney Pictures) reminds me of those Manhattan ""vintage"" stores that try to trick you into paying 120 for a stained raincoat because hey its old Well no I dont want an expensive old raincoat that was unremarkable the first time around nor do I want an expensive (170 million) remodel of a 28-year-old matinee flick that was forgotten for a reason. Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) is the now-grown son of computer visionary Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who disappeared years before in the midst of working on a mysterious breakthrough in digital technology. While poking around his fathers abandoned video-game arcade--a fun set that should have been put to more extensive use--Sam finds himself transported through some kind of cosmic wormhole into an all-digital alternate universe where it turns out Kevin Flynn has been trapped all these years. This universe is a dark featureless place peopled by artificially-created beings in black suits with neon piping who spend their days watching gladiatorial motorcycle fights and deadly games of Glo-Frisbee. Their dictatorial ruler Clu is played by some amalgam of present-day Jeff Bridges and his CGI-youthened face and body. Unlike many critics who found this technology visually creepy I was actually pretty impressed by the films ability to conjure a young Jeff Bridges--even when Clu was interacting with flesh-and-blood characters his face looked surprisingly realistic and expressive. I just wish he had something notable to express. Advertisement So father and son are reunited in Kevins alternate-universe apartment which looks like the white room from the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey redecorated by Charles and Ray Eames. (Another nifty set by the way; when Tron Legacy isnt submerging us in boring green-striped blackness it gets high marks for production design.) Young Sam also meets the latex-catsuit-clad Quorra (Olivia Wilde) the last survivor of a super-race of digital beings who were killed off by the evil Clu. Sensing that the arrival of this outsider threatens his empire with extinction Clu institutes a repressive crackdown. Quorra Sam and Kevin join forces to make it back to the wormhole between the two worlds before Clu manages to get through it himself and wreak havoc in the ""real"" neon-piping-free world. When they reach the portal Kevin and his self-created avatar face off in a confrontation thats disappointingly similar to any action-movie climax. Did we endure all that blather about the ""digital frontier"" to watch two guys slug it out on a ledge? So does everything about Tron Legacy completely lack? A lot of people are praising this movies Daft Punk soundtrack and it might sound cool on its own through headphones but I experienced it mostly as very very loud and unrelenting ambient noise. Bridges gets a couple of laughs riffing on his Big Lebowski persona of enlightened stonerhood (""Youre messing with my Zen thing man"" he warns his excitable son). And Michael Sheen minces through an enjoyably campy scene or two as a fey villain who seems inspired by David Bowies Thin White Duke persona. But the rest of the performances range from unremarkable (Wilde) to laughably bad. (Especially Hedlund who resembles Hayden Christensen but lacks even one convincing facial expression--Christensen at least has the scowl.) Tron Legacy is the kind of sensory-onslaught blockbuster that tends to put me to sleep the way babies will nap to block out overwhelming stimuli. I confess I may have snoozed through one or two climactic battles only to be startled awake by an incoming neon Frisbee. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Like Slate on Facebook.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post You dont have to have a fondness for the 1982 sci-fi adventure ""TRON"" -- about a video-game maker trapped in his invention -- to see Disneys reboot of the cult flick ""TRON Legacy."" The script weighs down early dialogue with back story for newbies. But the real thing to know is that the ""legacy"" the title refers to is less that of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) to only child Sam (Garrett Hedlund) and more the dazzling bequest of one generation of visual special-effects whizzes to another. The new ""TRON"" is full of visual and sonic flash. Its also a glum ride. Theres scant levity in this F/X bauble. And the emotional gravity is implied more than achieved. Bridges reprises the role of inventor Flynn. A digitally rendered version of the actor represents Flynns video-game creation CLU. Original cast member Bruce Boxleitner plays Alan Bradley Flynns confidant -- and Sams surrogate dad and corporate mentor. Hes the only soul who believes that Flynn is alive. When Sams father disappeared the young heir was left with Encom a computer company thats grown exponentially. This allows him to be sulky and rebellious well into his 27th year. He drives his dads Ducati motorcycle lives in a loft on some imaginary pier and has a lot of daredevil in him. A page -- remember pagers? -- from 20 years earlier begins Sams journey into the Grid. There he finds his father; his fathers invention and nemesis CLU; and Quorra (Olivia Wilde) a beguiling ally. A nice-looking hunk often capable of showing a sensitive side Hedlund delivers his leaden lines with jaw-clenched seriousness even when hes wisecracking. Breaking the too-sober mood is Michael Sheen as a ""program"" named Castor dressed in white and happy to tease mince plot. Castor resembles Rutger Hauers replicant in ""Blade Runner"" with a dash of Caligula and Alex from ""A Clockwork Orange"" borrowed for chilling measure. ""TRON Legacy"" is a very big stage for first-time filmmaker Joseph Kosinski. A director of commercials for Nike Saab and the video games ""Halo"" and ""Gears of War"" Kosinski has a fluid way with advertisings evocative efficient power. Hes got an ear for music and a fondness for images of sleek tech toys. But these skills are not the same as being able to sustain a story even this tried-and-true father-son fable. ""TRON Legacy"" proves once again that movies can be incubators for exciting technological and F/X advances -- new cameras new 3-D and animation techniques -- while leaving our need for narrative unsatisfied. Yes the movie looks pretty cool. But the most interesting character is not a character at all. Its the original score by electronic music duo Daft Punk. With the exception of two 1980s pop tunes the soundtrack is nearly 100 minutes of symphonic at times epic music from the Grammy-winning DJs Guy- Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The pair even have a cameo rocking a club much as they do the film.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 17 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Apr. 18 2013 304PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Welcome to geek heaven a.k.a. Tron Legacy the sequel to an undistinguished 1982 sci-fi movie about a guy who gets lost in a computer game that introduced computer-generated imagery to movies. In the almost 30 years since its release Tron has evolved into enough of a cult that Disney has gambled it can be revived as a 3-D movie with an estimated budget in the 200-million (U.S.) range. With a curiously stubborn kind of integrity Tron Legacy follows what did and didnt work the first time - another weak story with sub-B-movie dialogue partly compensated for by intensely conceived geometric design and special effects. First-time director Joseph Kosinski is a former architect; the designer Darren Gilford comes from auto design. In other words this is a movie for your eyes only.The perfunctory narrative introduces Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) as the son of game designer Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who disappeared 20 years earlier in an effort to save the world from a rogue computer operating system. Sam still brooding over his dads disappearance is a wealthy lost soul living in his groovy loft riding his motorcycle and once a year playing a trick on the giant technology company Encom of which he is a major shareholder. One night he is lured to the dusty old video arcade that his father owned where at a little past the movies 20-minute mark he slips into his dads game and dull real life gets transformed. Most 3-D films feel too dark but Tron embraces the darkness in a disorienting night ride of electric black blue and orange geometric forms and splashes of colour.After playing a test match of laser murder Frisbee Sam finds himself in a giant gladiatorial arena involving flying motorcycles driven by rivals who look like people but are really ""programs"" that shatter on impact. The entire world of the ""grid"" is under the control of Clu who has the somewhat rubbery-looking CGI face of a young Jeff Bridges. A former game-playing avatar of Kevin Flynns Clu has evolved into a combination of Satan and Hitler programmed for tyrannical perfection and determined to expunge any flawed ""user"" elements from the Troniverse.The real Kevin Flynn middle-aged and grizzled (Bridges again) is living off the grid cohabiting with his favourite creation a near-human ""isomorphic algorithm"" named Quorra (Olivia Wilde) a nerd fantasy babe with her hair in a Louise Brooks angular bob dressed in a slinky bare-shouldered one-piece jumpsuit.In the past 30 years it would be hard to say that Tron has evolved as feminist-friendly zone though in fairness characterization is not the movies strong point for either sex. As Sam Hedlunds main job is to squint and ride motorcycles. Most of the human emotions are left to Bridges the good and evil versions. In an attempt at what we Earthlings call ""humour"" Flynn has evolved into a cyber version of the Dude from The Big Lebowski. Hes a self-styled ""biodigital jazzman"" who complains to his rambunctious son ""Youre messing with my Zen thing man.""Eventually Sam convinces his contemplative dad that its time for all of them to find their way back to the portal. The journey is long and repetitive with more glowing vehicle chases. Theres a welcome detour to the virtual worlds favourite underground watering hole run by a white-haired dandy named Zeus (Michael Sheen) who upon meeting Sam announces in a needless declaration of the movies messianic theme ""Behold the son of the Maker""Still that nightclub scene rocks in a techno kind of way. The setting suggests an eighties euro-disco airport hangar where sleek ""programs"" nuzzle in the corners to the power pulse of the French band Daft Punk while the bartender serves big Windex-coloured cocktails. Somehow the urgency of the escape mission becomes much more immediate. Three drinks in one of those places and you can never find a portal when you need one.Tron LegacyDirected by Joseph KosinskiWritten by Edward Kitsis and Adam HorowitzStarring Jeff Bridges Garrett Hedlund and Olivia WildeClassification PG Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

But its questionable whether it was worth the wait. By Peter Rainer Film critic December 17 2010 Save for later Saved In this undated photo actor Jeff Bridges is shown in Tron Legacy Bridges will play himself at his natural age and a computerized avatar called Clu who hasnt aged since around the time he was first created for the first Tron movie in 1982. Clu bears Bridges face altered to make him about 35 years old but its grafted onto the body of a younger actor. Disney Enterprises Inc./AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Back in 1982 Jeff Bridges appeared in ""Tron"" one of the first CGI movies - its only distinction. Now that CGI movies are coming at us from all sides the sequel ""Tron Legacy"" mostly in 3-D ought to have been state of the art. But theres not a whole lot of artistry to be found in this movie about a scion (Garrett Hedlund) who seeks out his long-missing genius-inventor father (Bridges) inside a vast computer grid. The creepola effects made me feel as if I was trapped inside a fluorescent lighting fixture.Was it really necessary to wait 28 years for a sequel that wasnt worth attempting in the first place? Director Joseph Kosinski has a background in commercials and it shows. Everything looks sleek but whos buying? Grade C- (Rated PG for sequences of sci-fi action violence and brief mild language.)

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Friday December 17 2010 400 AM Title Tron Legacy A computer hackers son searches for him in a video game. With Garrett Hedlund Jeff Bridges. Director Joseph Kosinski. (206) PG Violence. At area theaters. In IMAX and 3-D where available.The only way to see ""Tron Legacy"" is in IMAX 3-D so the full visual freakiness can engulf you and be appreciated the way you used to light up at the thought of a laser show set to ""Dark Side of the Moon.""Unfortunately that seems to be the only reason ""Tron Legacy"" was made.Story isnt important to this sci-fi adventure as evidenced by the long passages of nothing happening. And nobody was clamoring for a sequel to Disneys 1982 flick about a programmer sucked into a video-game matrix to lead a revolt among the circuitrys ""citizens"" -- the fun standup video game from the early Reagan years in fact remains the titles true legacy.The new followup though provides answers to questions no one was asking. So we see Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) the arcade owner/hacker from the original putting his young son Sam to bed in 1989 before disappearing. Flash-forward two decades and 27-year-old Sam (bland Garrett Hedlund) is eager to know what happened.At Kevins former game palace -- where Journey still rocks the jukebox and the beeps of Atari 2600 ghosts are heard -- Sam is snapped into the same cracked game-world as pop.But this time the neon-tube-like effects are replaced by a blue-tinged grid floating in 3-D amid a black void (its like youre playing paintball in a Spencers Gifts store). Sam soon finds not only the older bearded Kevin but also Kevins avatar Clu (a digitally de-aged Bridges) a simulation corrupted by its drive for perfection. While avoiding Clu Sam must find a way to get his father back to our world via a mysterious portal.All that is really just an excuse for ""light cycles"" to materialize around their riders as a lush wall-to-wall score by the electronica duo Daft Punk wraps around your cerebral cortex. Theres talk of ""isomorphic algorithms"" and a sexy being (Olivia Wilde) whos the first computer/human hybrid but the Oz-like world Sam steps into exists for the pizzazz. Stillonce were inside the computer its cooler than the dorky original but just as uninspiring.Neither Hedlund nor Wilde make an impression and when Michael Sheen shows up as a villainous program looking like David Bowie circa 1973 and surrounded by playmates in body suits the movie could be a relative of ""Flash Gordon"" instead of ""Tron.""Still Bridges is enjoyable as he gives the older Flynn a Zen hero quality and even breaks through the effects to make his younger-Clu-self oddly engaging.In fact if nostalgia pulls you into this you could follow it up by seeing Bridges as crotchety Rooster Cogburn in next weeks ""True Grit.""All those Jeffs would make for a real head trip.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

( ) How to describe the visual scintillation that is ""Tron Legacy""? Ninja Vegas? Black Mass at Best Buy? Mummenschanz Goes Electric Boogaloo? Whatever. The sequel to 1982s ""Tron"" is an eyeball party. The score by Daft Punk which veers from homages to Hans Zimmers thundery work in ""The Dark Knight"" to a retro-80s synth sound surpasses magnificence. Many were the moments during action scenes when I (nearly) shed my customary phlegmatic equilibrium and (almost) thought Hey this is really exciting As for the script abort retry fail? Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund who desperately wants to be Harrison Ford but makes you long for Chris Pine) is a genius hacker. His annual hobby is pranking the tech company that thanks to his fathers disappearance 20 years ago he mostly owns. Dad Kevin (Jeff Bridges who does a lot to hold things together) once told the lad that he was about to tap into the Secret of Everything. (Maybe he wound up running Stark Industries and getting smoked by Iron Man?) Sam lost his mom too but any tragic foundations for this lil Bruce Wayne are discarded in favor of Hedlunds smirking and some of the worst one-liners known to any universe real or simulated. Sam avers that his dad is ""either dead or chillin in Costa Rica. Probably both."" Moments of mortal peril are undercut by idiot-speak like ""This cant be good"" and ""I know you probably get this a lot but theres been a mistake."" What daft punk wrote the instantly outdated line ""Ice caps are melting war in the Middle East Lakers-Celtics back at it""? Would-be Christopher Nolans (""TL"" is directed by 36-year-old rookie Joseph Kosinski) should note that one big reason Nolans work seems more grown-up than the competition is that he leaves out the 10th grade-isms. On his dads trail Sam plunges into a parallel cyber-universe where his father is still alive though a virtual prisoner in a matrix run by his evil twin Clu an insidious program played by a digitally re-created 1980s Jeff Bridges who looks like a product of Madame Tussauds CGI Museum. Bridges uncanny rubber-ducky skin detracts from the malevolence of the villain. But in five years theyll have the digi-Botox mastered. This conjures exciting visions of graying stars once again toplining franchise pictures -- with corresponding unemployment for the Garrett Hedlunds. I was thoroughly bedazzled by the digital grid even though I had questions (its unclear what the gizmos can do and what the physical rules of the space are). Immediately upon arrival Sam gets in a spiffy gladiatorial stadium death match involving buzz-saw e-Frisbees that zing off the walls like air-hockey pucks. Soon everyones on flashy face-first ""Dark Knight"" motorcycles -- which mainly seem to give racers a way to zoom up and punch each other in the face. Later there will be an awesome bar fight involving Sam and his cybergirl protector (Olivia Wilde). The emcee for this segment is a fey fixer played by Michael Sheen (""Libations for everybody""). Picture David Bowies Thin White Duke with an electronic cane that shoots laser bullets. This is followed by a sensational dogfight in which the fighters streak the inky cyber-sky with their colorblock exhaust plumes. I couldnt figure out why cyberspace was so windy though. I guess Bridges black ""Matrix"" coat simply must rustle defiantly in the fierce apocalyptic breeze. Also The character Tron a cyber-buddy of Kevins barely appears in the film. I quibble. For all of its buggy storytelling ""Tron Legacy"" plugs into your cerebral cortex and makes it sizzle. Its orders come straight from Sheens character when he cries out in a party-starting moment ""Electrify the boys and girls if you would be so kind."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Spider Man in web of problems delays Broadway opening a...

The contradictions at the heart of the film dont quite do its namesake justice. Starring Jeff Bridges Garrett Hedlund Olivia Wilde Bruce Boxleitner Michael Sheen James Frain Beau Garrett Director Joseph Kosinski Running time 207 Release Opened Dec 17 2010  Editorial Review Man vs. machine Techno babbleBy Michael OSullivanFriday December 17 2010There are worse things than being trapped inside a computer game with Olivia Wilde. In ""Tron Legacy"" the loud long and less than wholly satisfying sequel to ""Tron"" thats the bittersweet fate of Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) the computer-nerd hero of both the 1982 sci-fi cult classic and its high-tech 3-D update. When we first meet the now-grizzled Flynn - who we learn in a prologue has been missing since 1989 - hes literally trapped inside a video game he created a flesh-and-blood fugitive from a digital fascist state whose primary form of entertainment is gladiator-style combat using lethal flying disks and lightning-fast motorcycles. But its not all bad He also lives with a smoking-hot babe in a body suit named Quorra (Wilde from TVs ""House""). In the two decades since Flynn disappeared from the real world he has managed to not only stay alive but also to carve out a sweet life in hiding far from the deadly gaming ""grid"" he designed. In the years since he has gotten stuck in this parallel universe Flynn it seems has grown philosophical about his situation. More specifically he has turned into a geek-chic version of the Dude the laid-back slacker character Bridges played in ""The Big Lebowski."" Flynn spends much of ""Tron Legacy"" meditating - he calls it ""knocking on the sky and listening to the sound"" - and addressing everyone as ""man."" The best way to fight he says is to ""do nothing be still."" All thats missing is a white Russian in his hand. Quorra as it turns out isnt exactly Flynns girlfriend but his protege. For one thing she isnt actually a girl but an ""isomorphic algorithm."" (Dont ask. You take it on faith like warp drive.) Into this cozy domestic situation comes Flynns son Sam (Garrett Hedlund). Like his father Sam is a geek. After getting a telephone page - how last century - that seems to have originated from the elder Flynns old office Sam manages with a few keystrokes to get sucked into the same virtual world that his long-lost father and Quorra live in. Sam awakens in his father a yearning for the outside. Now its up to the three of them to get there. Let the games begin. Much of ""Tron Legacy"" involves heart-pounding if protracted sequences of video game action as Quorra and the Flynns make their way toward the exit. (If you have the Light Bike app on your iPhone - or have seen the original ""Tron"" - youll get the picture.) Theres a lot of smashing crashing and flashing lights as evil humanoid ""programs"" pursue our heroes and are summarily ""de-rezzed"" a word derived from de-resolution which is what happens when bad computer programs go boom. At times the soundtrack is so loud that you feel it more than hear it. Kind of cool if you like that sort of thing. Another cool thing? Bridges gets to play not one but two parts in the film. Using digital technology the actor appears both as he looks today and as his younger ""Tron""-era self a digital doppelganger of Flynn called Clu (for ""Codified Likeness Utility"") that Flynn originally created to run the digital universe he designed. Clu is the heros evil twin a CEO run amok. Its a pretty neat effect. British actor Michael Sheen also shines as one of Clus mid-level managers an evil imp with a cane and a mane of white hair. He runs some sort of nightmarish nightclub where the members of the electropop duo Daft Punk are house DJs. They also scored the film which explains why much of it sounds like a rave. This brings us to a fundamental contradiction at the heart of ""Tron Legacy"" (or for that matter ""Tron""). Sonically visually and conceptually its a richly imagined world. So richly imagined in fact that its easy to see why gamers would fall in love with the idea of it. It fulfills the ultimate escapist fantasy of the user entering what can otherwise only be experienced from the outside with a game controller. But if that noisy adrenaline-addled universe is so wonderful why are Quorra Sam and his father so all fired up to get out of it and back to a world of long walks on the beach and quiet conversation? Written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Joseph Kosinski the movie argues that doing nothing and being still are better than the frenetic activity of the game grid. But can the movie have it both ways? When you finally stumble back into the relative peace and quiet of the lobby itll hit you. ""Tron Legacy"" may be nice place to visit but you wouldnt want to live there.Contains computer-game violence.

Black minimalist streaked with neon piping and floaty geometric figures it was home to enslaved ""programs"" who played deadly gladiatorial games (Frisbee Jai-alai) at the whim of an evil operating system with a giant Lego head. Everyone wore dorky uniforms. There was no downtown no crowded arenas no nightlife and certainly no drunken hobos. My how times have changed. In Tron Legacy the long-awaited sequel to the innovative 1982 Disney film Kevins son enters the Grid in search of his long-lost dad. Its still a monochromatic world streaked with light bluish for good guys reddish for bad. But the programs are -- whats the phrase? -- party animals. They hang out at dance clubs. They drink cocktails with cute glass umbrellas. Head-bobbing DJs spin Daft Punk. A bleached Michael Sheen swivels his hips swirls a cane and channels Malcolm McDowell. And when a program hits bottom he huddles with a bottle on the sidewalk. Ummm ... what? Lets return to the so-called real world for a moment. Cocky young Sam (Garrett Hedlund all eyebrows and swagger) hasnt seen his pa since 1989 when Flynn Pere disappeared off the planet after talk of ""a miracle"" in the Grid. When old friend Alan (Bruce Boxleitner also reprising his role as the program Tron) reports a page from Kevins old phone at the video arcade Sam checks it out. There he gets sucked into the Grid where he meets his fathers power-hungry alter ego -- Clu played by a young performance-captured simulacrum of Bridges -- and gets conscripted into the games. After a few rounds of mortal Frisbee and lickety-split ""light-cycle"" races Sam hooks up with Quorra (Olivia Wilde) a genial program who brings him to the actual older Kevin in his well-appointed batcave. Kevin now bearded barefoot and totally Zen tells the story of his entrapment over an elegant dinner with roast suckling pig. Ummm ... huh? Just to be clear The original Tron was groundbreaking goofy and inscrutable with eye-popping graphics and lots of wooden dialogue. This sequel is also goofy also eye-popping - see it in IMAX 3D if you really want to fry your optic nerve - and also weakly scripted borrowing from various Star Wars films plus The Elephant Man (""Im not a program""). And yet the sheer size of the thing works against it The effects are absolutely spectacular but they blow the goofy-cheesy quotient straight through the roof. In revisiting the Grid first-time director Joseph Kosinski and screenwriters Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis have hyperbolized every last detail. So yes. Roast pig in three dimensions. Regarding Bridges digital de-aging Its creepy. Its a little less creepy on Clus face (hes not human anyway) than on Kevins in a scene from 1989 but on either of them it has the waxen look of storefront mannequins - or over-Botoxed socialites.

Thats all the movie has going for it and in just about every other way a movie can fail Tron Legacy does. All the building-block elements are so weak or underdeveloped they would be overtaxed by the demands of a music video. Disneys big holiday-season spectacle is the (almost) 30-years-after sequel to the original that opened in 1982 to much buzz about its futuristic look and technology. The original combined computer animation and live action and it became a modest financial success and a (not-so-great) video game.Like its offspring the original Tron looked good but wasnt. For all the technological revolutions the problems with the franchise remain the same. Given that the movie was directed by a guy - Joseph Kosinski - with an architecture and design background but almost no film or storytelling experience it shouldnt come as a surprise that Tron Legacy creates a digital world thats beautiful to behold while telling a story that makes virtually no sense. Given that six people have writing credits it was probably inevitable that the dialogue is a patchwork of cliches. Even with two Lost veterans - Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz - leading the screenwriting effort this updated story sinks under the weight of its own mystical mumbo-jumbo and pseudoscience gobbledygook.Jeff Bridges is back as whiz software programmer Kevin Flynn whos become a loving but distracted father to his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund). He keeps telling Sam about this wonderful new world hes discovered-created with his computers but then he disappears before he can take Sam there. Flash forward and Sams an angry young man who wants no part of the distinctly Microsoft-like corporate behemoth his dad left behind. In a sequence too silly to describe Sam is transported into the Grid the digital realm where his father is being held prisoner by the program - played by a supercreepy digitized young Bridges - named Clu. Is it intended to be funny that Clu in his dictator-like quest for perfection doesnt have a clue? If so its the only comic flourish in an otherwise oppressively serious tale. The lone spark is provided by Michael Sheen who as a double-dealing nightclub impresario has gone from David Frost to David Bowie.Bridges is helpless to save this Titanic as he is forced to play the grizzled hippie-wise man - shades of the Dude creep in - scatting about ""biodigital jazz"" and ""isomorphic algorithms"" while trying to make lines like ""sometimes life has a way of moving you past wants and hopes"" sound deep and visionary rather than sad and silly. Nobody is that good an actor. Hedlund is fine as the brash and impulsive Sam and Olivia Wilde does her best to play a new life form in some cute and familiar ways. To save some ""whos the blonde in Tron"" Googling The sexy program named Gem is played by Beau Garrett.The special-effects and action sequences particularly the light-cycles contest and the nightclub fight scene are dazzling. You may just want to load the Daft Punk soundtrack (the duo have a cameo as the helmeted DJs at the club) onto an MP3 player put on your headphones and your 3-D glasses and crank up the music.Directed by Joseph KosinskiStarring Jeff Bridges Garrett Hedlund Olivia Wilde Bruce Boxleitner and Michael SheenRun time 125 minutes at the Texas TheatreMPAA rating PG-13 (sequences of sci-fi action violence and brief mild language) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

This is a formal way of saying youll be deleted an act that looks like an explosion of pixels and neatly references the disposal of an opponent in a video game. But I found it a fitting description for the experience of watching Tron Legacy the sequel much-anticipated by passionate admirers of the original and mostly confusing to the rest of us. Tron Legacy de-resolved me. It activated my couch potato impulses. I wanted to loll in my chair enjoying its dark cinematography punctuated by aesthetically appealing neon while Daft Punks strangely soothing electronica washed over me. The movie is like visiting Satans spa. (See the top 10 movies of 2010.) Robbed of my own resolution meant that I never worked up any dislike for the movie. Tron Legacy is not good but it is amiable. While it seems less like a parody than the original it is also silly in a not unpleasing way. I generally have little use for 3-D but the effects in this film are subtle and well-executed; as these things go the least obnoxious ever. Also I love Jeff Bridges and here were three of him one the real present-day Jeff nicely grizzled and saying ""Man"" a lot; then two computer-generated younger versions one nice one evil both handsome and strapping although troubling to look at in the same way that a Jeff Koons sculpture of Jeff Koons is troubling. (Is Tron Legacy a virtual-reality odyssey or takedown of cyberculture?) There are no innovations in plot just some standard father issues and a need to escape. Director Joseph Kosinski making his feature film debut opens with a prologue set in 1989 in which Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges the non-villainous youthful model) tells a bedtime story about his ""Tron"" adventures to his young son Sam. Then Kevin disappears into the night on a motorcycle never to be seen again. Soon the boy is a tragic orphan with tons of cash. When we see Sam next hes a grown man (Garrett Hedlund a more macho Hayden Christensen) emotionally crippled by his fathers desertion. He lives in an industrial man-cave with only a dog and gadgets to keep him company and refuses to be involved in Encom the Microsoft-like corporate beast that is his fathers legacy unless its to cause mischief. Kevins old partner Alan (Bruce Boxleitner reprising his role from the original) refuses to believe that Kevin is dead. The supposition is that hes trapped within the Grid the digital frontier which he continued to visit after the events of the first movie pursuing a dream for mankind involving freedom shared wisdom and technology -- kind of like Linus Torvalds but with James Camerons ego. (Comment on this story.) A beeping page sent from Kevins long-disconnected number entices Sam to the arcade his father used to run. A portal opens and Sam steps in anticipating seeing his father. And Kevin is indeed there dressing in flowing white outfits accessorized with prayer beads and spending a lot of time on a meditation pillow but before Sam can find him he -- like his father before him -- is forced to join a group of sacrificial programs playing gladiator-like games involving glowing Frisbees. Sam a ""user"" in Tronspeak yells ""I am not a program"" a bunch. It does not quite have the emotional heft of the Elephant Man telling us ""I am not an animal."" I chalk this up to the fact that he and his opponents are dressed in skintight outfits that look uncannily like my set of Master Mechanics screwdrivers which are also black and fetchingly trimmed with bright yellow. Mocking aside the filmmakers do pay artful homage to the original Tron right down to the headgear and modes of transport while taking the look well beyond ""Trons"" quaint dot-matrix origins. (The light cycles of old are stylishly reimagined as muscular super-bikes; better than a Segway any day.) (See the top 10 arcade games of all time.) The main problem with the Grid other than the dodgy opening hours of the exit portal Sam must reach in order to escape is that its kind of a stultifying place. The films logic is too muddled to be engaging. The requisite hot girl Quorra (Olivia Wilde) has a drearily familiar childlike interest in the world of mankind. The main villain Clu (Bridges again youthful and evil this time) wants to escape the Grid and take over the planet. But the digital recreation isnt perfect; he looks just like young Bridges if young Bridges had had way too much plastic surgery so its hard to take him seriously. Clu seems more like an unfortunate Botox victim than a dastardly despot. The only lively spot in Tron-land is a bar run by Castor (a giddy Michael Sheen) where programs go to unwind with a glass of day-glo contrast fluid. Just for a minute I questioned why programs needed to consume anything. Then I resolved to de-resolve sinking back into the films elegant lethargy. See the top 10 movie performances of 2010.

Disney Enterprises By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 17 2010 1201 a.m. ET Breathes there a movie with soul so dead as ""TRON Legacy?"" Well ""Speed Racer"" lumbers to mind. That was a nightmare vision of entertainment in the digital age though the cast did include a pet chimp that mugged for its close-ups. Disneys ponderous sequel to the 1982 ""TRON"" bets the whole silicon-based farm--a budget of at least 170 million plus megamarketing costs--on a video-game esthetic that apes the look of Steven Lisbergers original but adds precious little humanity to the visually spectacular 3-D remix. (The new version which is also being shown in 3-D IMAX was directed by Joseph Kosinksi; its his first feature film.) Watch a clip from ""Tron Legacy"" starring Jeff Bridges. When ""TRON"" came to the screen almost three decades ago it was widely admired for its trailblazing use of computer graphics and for the bright spirit of its intricate video-game mythology. Other films most notably ""Star Wars"" had already employed digital effects on a comparatively small scale but ""TRON"" took audiences to a computer-generated world called the Grid in the company of Jeff Bridgess video-game designer Kevin Flynn who got sucked into the virtual environment he had created. By the end of the film Kevin had managed to escape back into the real world. When ""TRON Legacy"" gets under way though he has been missing for 20 years. Thats because as the trailers have already revealed he got himself trapped once again in the perilous land of bits and bytes so its up to his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) to rescue him. Sams entry into the digital domain is staged poetically with the classic fantasy element of a secret door and an opening up from 2-D to 3-D that evokes the transition from black and white to Technicolor in the preface of ""The Wizard of Oz."" No sooner than ""TRON Legacy"" opens up though it starts to freeze up with one feeling-free sequence after another A reception committee of what seem to be robotic Playboy bunnies with Light Discs on their backs instead of tails; a vast expanse a la ""Triumph of the Will"" of faceless soldiers representing computer programs; an outbreak of brainlessly repetitive Light Disc combat; a succession of eye-popping ear-shattering and brain-numbing races on neon-trimmed Light Cycles. (Daft Punk did the soundtrack which achieves a loud grandeur that the film reaches for but mostly misses.) Light is a motif here but there isnt much of it given the films slavish adherence to original blacks and dark blues. (Would the fan base have been outraged by a slight expansion of the visual spectrum?) Nor is there much fun in the real-world sense of the term except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen as a program called Castor--basically a nightclub owner--who warns Sam that he is about to cross the Sea of Simulation and its ""going to be quite a ride."" The whole thing is a sea of sensory stimulation a deadly efficient machine for merchandising toys video games theme-park rides and yes even movie tickets. The film discharges its stylistic debts to its source material with rigid devotion while offering a few surprises along the way. The best of them involve Mr. Bridges who plays not only Kevin Flynn and Clu the computer program he created but Kevin at two stages of life represented in the two films--as the father Sam has been searching for a sort of defeated hippie elder who has settled for a passive life with his Lycra-clad acolyte Quorra (Olivia Wilde); and as a 30-something man with a Jeff Bridges face youthened by the same digital techniques that aged Brad Pitt in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" (The illusion is remarkable except for the mouth which looks more than artfully animated but less than fully human.) A message lies in old Kevins rueful admission ""I screwed it up chasing after perfection."" Yet the larger message of ""TRON Legacy"" is that ""TRON""s legacy is nothing more than technological a razzle-dazzle display of effects that are far more special than they were in 1982 but cold effects nevertheless. Its dispiriting to see how little attention the filmmakers have paid to the dramatic--read human--possibilities of the original or how much theyve been overwhelmed by technologys demands. Its as though rogue programs took over the production. Watch a clip from ""Rabbit Hole"" starring Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart. Rabbit Hole Nicole Kidman places the bereaved heroine of ""Rabbit Hole"" in a nether land between life and not-quite-life. Her beautiful performance transcends the specifics of the script which David Lindsay-Abaire adapted from his play of the same name. (The film was directed by John Cameron Mitchell.) Ms. Kidmans Becca and Aaron Eckharts Howie have lost their only child to a random accident; the little boy was struck by a car while chasing his dog. Howie copes with his grief--as much as anyone can cope with such grief--by clinging to every trace of their sons life. Becca in her turn wants to banish all reminders and sell their suburban New York house. Thats the schematic part of their parallel lives. The haunting part is how Becca moves through her days. She drives she does laundry she smiles on occasion and jogs on her treadmill but shes elusive to herself as well as others a spirit in transit to unknown parts. ENLARGE Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart as grieving parents in Rabbit Hole. Lionsgate The script has many specifics to transcend; its a single-minded construction that excludes most countercurrents. The couple seeks solace in a support group. A child seat still occupies its customary place in the back of their sedan. Beccas mother Nat (Dianne Wiest) talks constantly about the death of her drug-addicted son Beccas brother. Howie keeps old videos of his vanished son on his phone and watches them obsessively. Yet the most affecting moments are the oblique ones when Howie reconnects with his dog; when Becca reconnects obsessively but courageously with the neighborhood boy who drove the fateful car; when the boy who is played with sweet simplicity by Miles Teller reveals his own struggle to understand death and loss; and when Becca toward the end speculates on some of the things that she and Howie might say at a party. In doing so shes rehearsing for the possibility of happiness. ENLARGE Reese Witherspoon and Owen Wilson are a couple in How Do You Know. Columbia Pictures How Do You Know No need to belabor the awfulness of this film a romantic comedy devoid of romance--instead of chemistry theres the flow of reverse magnetism--and lacking in comic timing let alone comic content. Reese Witherspoon is Lisa a recently prominent womens softball player whose career has begun to decline. She must choose between her boyfriend Matty a major-league pitcher played by Owen Wilson and Paul Rudds George a major-league corporation executive who may have to take the fall for his larcenous father. (That crudely written role is played grotesquely by Jack Nicholson.) Though romantic comedy is the chosen genre of ""How Do You Know"" mysteries surface at every turn. Why are so many scenes so clumsy in their depiction of clumsy behavior? Why is the photography so overbright and ugly? Why dont we learn the specific reason for Georges indictment? Why cant we see at least a fragment of one of Mattys games? Why cant Lisa see that Matty is a charmless narcissistic lout? Most mysterious of all--and this isnt belaboring its expressing real bafflement--how could this sloppy sluggish production have been written and directed by James L. Brooks the man who gave us such memorable films as ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Broadcast News""? The title refers to matters of the heart how do you know youre in love? But it could refer just as well to cinematic quality. How do you know a movie is a total loss? When you watch it with a heavy heart and sit through it like a stone. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) ENLARGE Never has Jeff Bridges been a stronger presence or Beau Bridges a more touching one than in Steve Klovess masterful debut as a writer-director. (He wrote and directed only one other feature ""Flesh and Bone"" before adapting all but one of the Harry Potter films to date.) The two brothers play Jack and Frank Baker musician brothers with a lounge act in need of new energy. Thats provided by Michelle Pfeiffers Susie Diamond an insouciant singer with a sultry voice. (Ms. Pfeiffer did her own singing live and every measure is a treat.) The Others (2001) In this supernatural thriller set in a fogbound mansion on the Isle of Jersey Nicole Kidmans Grace waits for her soldier husband to come home from World War II. Poor Grace has a lot to contend with. Her young daughter and son are in contact with resident ghosts. Whats more the kids seem to be severely photosensitive so Grace protects them by shutting windows and doors like some crazed deputy of the light police. Alejandro Amenabar directed from his own script. The script has problems but Ms. Kidman plays her role with impressive intensity. Walk the Line (2005) Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for her performance as June Carter opposite Joaquin Phoenixs Johnny Cash. He takes charge of his role slowly but surely and then superbly. Shes been celebrated for previous roles--contemporary comic acting doesnt get any better than what she did in ""Election"" or ""Legally Blonde""--but her work as Cashs beloved wife is still startling for its humor verve and intelligence. James Mangold directed this excellent biographical film from an adaptation that he and Gill Dennis based on two Johnny Cash books ""Man in Black"" and ""Cash The Autobiography."" --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Music of Daft Punk. The elements are there but the movie proves a high-tech hodge-podge. By Colin Covert Star Tribune December 17 2010 -- 929pm  Disney Garrett Hedlund takes a wild ride as an extreme sports-doin hacker rebel. Garrett Hedlund Disney Enterprises Inc. All Rights Reserved. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Early in ""Tron Legacy"" a skeptical executive asks the chairman of software giant Encom what valuable new features theyve added to the 12th generation of their operating system. ""We put a 12 on the box"" he replies. ""Tron"" feels like a product of that cop-out mentality. The package is shiny and new but the movie is a hodgepodge of ideas lifted from science-fiction classics fast-paced action tedium and flimsy connective tissue. Its bloatware. Garrett Hedlund delivers a bland generic performance as Sam Flynn whose father Kevin the software genius behind Encom vanished two decades earlier during a long night at the office. An opening sequence of high-tech burglary establishes Sam as a chopper-ridin extreme sports-doin hacker rebel who steals Encoms source code and Wikileaks it on the net. This public-domain Robin Hood is a perverse hero for a movie from Disney which deploys battalions of bloodthirsty copyright lawyers to protect its properties. Its our first warning that ""Tron"" will be longer on CGI than IQ. After falling down a digital rabbit hole Sam finds himself in a plasticine dystopia among humanoid programs that duel like Frisbee-flinging glow-stick-swinging acrobats. Thats a potentially amusing illustration of the glitches that keep our devices from performing seamlessly. But the film never takes a moment to step back from its smash-a-palooza mayhem and see the joke. The script by Adam Horowitz and Eddy Kitsis who previously wrote the incoherent TV series ""Lost"" does not advance their reputations . Instead we get sterile glossy visuals. Bubble-wheeled motorcycles and sleek jets that leave contrails of light in their wake body-glove costumes with reflective tape pinstriping and Jeff Bridges computer-morphed to his 33-year-old glory as CLU the program created by the elder Flynn to keep Tronland running smoothly. After several decades in power CLU has gone despotic ranting like a 128-bit Mussolini and scheming to seize the ring of power from his creator. Kevin is on the scene too older and wiser played by the present-day Bridges as a Buddhist gene-splice of Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Dude. He delivers camp classic dialog like ""Youre messing with my Zen thing man"" with admirable commitment. The flesh-and-blood Bridges also out-acts his digital counterpart whose lips never quite move in synch with his speech. The best acting in the film is done by Michael Sheen as a purring prancing albino nightclub owner (dont ask why programs need to party you wont get an answer). Sheens antic turn melding Ziggy Stardust-era Bowie and Malcolm McDowells high-kicking Alex from ""A Clockwork Orange"" is the films too-brief high point. Like Daft Punks hotly anticipated electronica soundrtack the film sparks to life only briefly. Instead of bringing virtual reality to life ""Tron"" delivers only virtual entertainment.

More about Tron Legacy >> The same cannot be said of the follow-up. With its Zen jargon martial-arts moves and neon glow the sequel demonstrates that you can teach an old dog new Matrix. Legacy is a two-hour light show with a lot of flash a little style and not one byte of narrative originality. Unless of course you count the spectacle of Jeff Bridges age 61 facing off against his digitally tweaked doppelganger who resembles Bridges circa 34. In the first TRON Bridges is Flynn a game designer sucked into the circuitry of a Master Control Program where his digital avatar fights that of the corporate baddie who has stolen his idea for the game. In Legacy Flynn last seen on the eve of a major discovery has gone missing for 20 years. Then his adult son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) learns Dad has sent a pager message to his former partner. So Sam goes back to Dads mothballed video arcade to find the portal to the Grid - the computer innerscape Dad told him about in bedtime stories years ago. In a reverse of The Wizard of Oz Legacy goes from color to principally black-and-white (and from 2-D to 3-D) once Sam falls into the Grid. There Sam encounters CLU (say ""clue"") Flynns creation and avatar who has grown in power and is trying to eliminate his creator. In this luminous landscape ""programs"" - that is humanoid creatures that run the games - zip by on lightcycles motorbikes with neon details instead of chrome. Gamers fight each other in a tourney of death that resembles Ultimate Frisbee with deadly neon discs. Admittedly these graphics would be pretty cool in a video game. But unlike games movies need something more than vaporizing your enemy and getting from one level to the next with your friend. This is something director Joseph Kosinski does not provide. Hedlund not the brightest light on this display panel doesnt bring much to the film. The movie perks up a bit when Michael Sheen resembling David Bowie in his Aladdin Sane period goose-steps through a Grid nightspot twirling his neon nightstick like a majorette her baton. And it gets a little boost from Olivia Wilde as Quorra a cybernetic lifeform called an ""iso"" (as in isometric algorithm cousin of the midichlorians of Star Wars) Flynns ward and Sams love interest. To the extent Legacy has an emotional arc its the run-up to the reunion between Sam and his father. Bridges Flynn is very Dude Wan Kenobi clad in monkish robes describing a humming sound as ""Bio-digital jazz man"" When Sam presses him to explain whats going on Flynn snaps ""Youre messing with my Zen thing"" Bridges hipster ravings turn Legacy into an unintentional comedy. This makes it a degree more bearable than the gaudy Nintendo prototype it would be otherwise. Game over. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + So youre a guy who rides a motorbike around town. Youre about 25 and your fathers been missing since you were 12. His computer company has just released a pricey new operating system meant to be distributed for free. And his old business partner has just been paged from somewhere inside dads long-defunct video arcade. You find a secret lair behind a console of the game he invented.Suddenly youre zapped from boring old Earth into dads computer program. The slashes of neon circuitry are galactic disco the ground is nothing but moving shifting panels of macrochip and light. You stand in the middle of an enormous chamber as hot femme bots drift out of Svedka vodka ads -- or seem to anyway -- and make sex faces as they strip then dress you in a sleek laser-lit unitard. You know exactly where you are and its awesome. Yet all that two screenwriters have given you to say is ""This cant be good.And it isnt.""Tron Legacy gives us a dud stud named Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn the hero of this petrified sequel to 1982s ""Tron. None of what he sees impresses. The feeling is mutual. At an alleged cost of 200 million thats some yawn. If he cant be thrilled why should we?Wonderland intrigued Alice. Dorothy was in awe of Oz. Jake Sully so learned to love Pandora that he came to rule it. Sam is content to become an action figure slinging discs of light at anonymous opponents for the thrill of computer-generated crowds. Hes looking for his father Kevin Flynn and discovers that not only has Flynns hacker-program avatar turned evil and taken over this digital world (its called the Grid) but that Jeff Bridges plays both men. The latter is heavy and grizzled the former is fit and digitally reupholstered like Tom Hankss train conductor in ""The Polar Express. Its ""Crazy Heart Bridges versus ""Starman.Youd think that as Sam made his way around the Grid his eyes would at least go wide -- or his brow would furrow -- at the fact that his fathers game and Disneys visionary movie have changed. This sequel is as obsessed with the decor of ""2001 as ""Inception was but really Sam is now in ""Star Wars. Everyone on the Grid wears Stormtrooper white or Darth Vader black. And that headgear? Luke I am your fathers helmet. Once Bridges starts gliding around in baggy spa whites and oracular robes with halo-glow insets spewing koans of sub-""Lebowski dudeness (""The only way to win is not to play) you wonder how Obi-Wan Kenobi came to be reborn as Laurence Fishburne in ""The Matrix.The ""legacy of the title appears to be that of George Lucas. Which of course should be the last thing an admirer of ""Tron wants to see Bill Gates taking over Apple. The original movie remains a landmark fantasia. Some of it was computer-animated bits of it were hand-drawn and while it saw the future of gaming entertainment and the predominance of special effects it still looks like nothing else. Thats an achievement for a movie under so many influences the silent era classical architecture jai alai ultimate Frisbee Pong futurism ancient Rome Fritz Langs ""Metropolis Chris Markers ""La Jetee Ridley Scotts ""Blade Runner Leni Riefenstahl Akira Kurosawa Stanley Kubrick math class. ""Tron comprised so many references that the allusions produced a wholly new movie. The grid-bound chase sequences among the light cycles -- motorbikes that leave behind hard walls of color -- are still a kinetic high-point of movie design. ""Tron had an almost Japanese fidelity to space and framing. The movie was an expression of paranoia about the end of privacy and the ominous omnipotence of the corporation. It used Orwellian ideas to express proletarian concerns. It didnt go that deep -- writer-director Steven Lisberger was cautioning more than chastising. But the movie had soul and pop and personality. It felt electric. At the time we knew outer space all too well. ""Tron was the rare film to conceptualize a kind of inner space.The colors in this sequel look richer thicker -- the lights are more licorice than the bubble-gum palette of the original. The cycles have been replaced by ""light jets which provide an appealing-looking decently orchestrated sky chase. The Grid scenes meanwhile were shot using 3-D and its a terrible sign when a film warns you with great seriousness that some of the scenes were shot in 2-D then implores you never to remove your glasses. Why the surgeon-general tone?The lush electro-orchestral score is by the French duo Daft Punk who put in an appearance at a DJ booth and their music is 3-D for the ear a perfect expansion of Wendy Carloss original synth fuzz and blips. Director Joseph Kosinski is credible but his movie says nothing yet weighs a ton the heaviest gas available. The opening quarter is bad in the same wooden over-explicated way that say ""Mulholland Drive and ""Avatar were. ""Tron Legacy simply lacks that conversation moment where you stop worrying and fall under a spell. In Kosinski the movie has a mechanic when it needs a magician.Either way his hat here would be overstuffed. Did this movie need both Michael Sheen queening it up as an albino David Bowie (inglorious alabaster) and news of a nonhuman girl (Olivia Wilde) who holds the key to the future of humanity? That means the movie has designs on a franchise. This cant be good.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Jeff Bridges returns as the hotshot computer programmer who disappeared into a dystopian cyber world though the story belongs mostly to the son who goes looking for him (Garrett Hedlund). The special effects are incredible blah blah blah but oddly the most effective element here is the original movies striking visual design--everything pitch black except for the luminescent piping on the costumes and foreground objects--which was inspired by the primitive arcade games of the early 80s. Bruce Boxleitner reprises his role as the villain and a digitally doctored Michael Sheen turns up as the second-string baddie a fruity albino who tosses off giggly one-liners.

Share Tweet There are wordless stretches in Tron Legacy the sequel to Disneys 1982 debacle-turned-nostalgia-piece Tron where electronic circuits light up like streets on a city grid and Daft Punks score pulses on the soundtrack all to suggest a cool world where technology and human life have become pleasingly integrated. This was the forward-thinking philosophy that drove Jeff Bridges hippie visionary to invent a laser that turned real objects and people into computer code. Tron Legacy makes the mistake of taking this idea far too gravely. It tries to create a mythology around ""The Grid"" thats similar to that of The Matrix but goes about it like the worst parts of Reloaded and Revolutions--explaining everything clarifying nothing. Disney has once again constructed a digital environment out of cutting-edge special effects only this time it isnt merely silly; its as dry and talky as a PBS panel show. Via flashback to 1989 with Bridges appearing in a younger CG form thats conspicuously odd and creepy Tron Legacy establishes that Bridges has been gone for 20 years leaving his son with a large share of ENCOM International now a Microsoft-like software giant. Much like his father the son (played as an adult by Garrett Hedlund) grows up with a healthy disdain for authority and rebels against ENCOM by releasing their latest operating system for free. When Bridges pages his old partner (Bruce Boxleitner) from his now-abandoned arcade Hedlund goes to investigate and winds up getting sucked into ""The Grid"" where father and son reunite to battle the totalitarian forces led by Bridges nefarious hacker duplicate CLU 2. The purpose of CLU 2s existence the various competing factions in conflict the rules that govern ""The Grid"" on the whole All these things (and more) require some exposition but Tron Legacy makes a movie out of it. The original Tron was by no means perfect--it was barely adequate for that matter--but it nonetheless had a sense of fun and adventure turning on the adolescent fantasy of arcade junkies being inside the games they play. Director Joseph Kosinski teases the audience with updated light-cycle and discus-game showdowns but its only an homage; his Tron pretends to greatness in ways that snuff out any flickers of joy. Because really a movie set within the circuitry of an arcade game must be taken with the utmost seriousness.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Tron Legacy amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << All Good Things Somewhere >> Tron Legacy Remember the last time you yelled at your computer? It does. Twenty-eight years have passed since software genius Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) created his personified programs--bytes that become men inside the matrix--and theyre still mad at their maker. Three decades the lifespan of ten modern laptops is a long time to carry a grudge against the Users who order them about with a clattering on their keyboard. Especially when the programs won. In Joseph Kosinskis update the computer swallowed Flynn in 1989 and sentenced him to exile in their matrix. Hidden in his secret laboratory untouched by power outages his computer gathered dust in our world while within its circuits hacking program CLU 2 (a Bridges hybrid) claims to be a liberator who herds his underlings thorough a hermetic revolution bloodless only by biology. (Death is but defragged pixels.) Think Kim Jong Il meets Caesar plus a few lines of code from Bill Gates. In 1982 only 8.57 percent of Americans had a home computer. The first Tron stumped audiences who couldnt grasp that the plastic box wasnt one genius but a house for small smart individual programs. Revisiting Tron feels archaeological. When Kevin Flynns son Sam (Garret Hedlund) unlocks his dads shuttered arcade the plastic tarps flutter over the old stand-up games and the jukebox blasts Journey. Hes Indiana Jones of our distant yesterday--only in a lightning-speed world can our own childhoods feel ancient. Before you can say ""Dont click Enter"" Sam finds his dads computer and is zoom-swooshed into Tron Town. His body bursts into bytes and the screen goes black and green and gorgeous and 3D--its the boldest brave new world moment of the movies since Dorothy blew into Oz. Director Kosinski started his career as an engineer and architect and it shows.Tron Legacy is a beautiful machine. Aristotle wrote ""The mathematical sciences particularly exhibit order symmetry and limitation--and these are the greatest forms of the beautiful."" Id love to sit next to him in the multiplex watching Kosinski paper his world in hexagons and detonate fireworks that explode into puffs of spheres and squares. The light cycles are glorious the new light planes nearly as cool. The sound design rattles the seats and if a scene in Tron can be shot thorough through a pane of glass hell do it for the shiny 3D depth. But theres little disorder--a.k.a. life--in this matrix. One of the biggest laughs comes when CLU 2s henchman the silicone-mohawked Jarvis (James Frain) accidentally knocks over a vase. Newcomer Hedlund has a heroic tiresome steadiness; his crush Quorra (Olivia Wilde a promising talent) is a robot. Its up to Bridges to give the film the human touch in tone deaf stoner quips describing one of his discoveries as ""Digital jazz man"" and later griping ""Youre messing with my Zen."" Its as though Kosinski looked down at his graph paper and decided to unleash The Dude. In the films last minutes it reaches for philosophy. Just as God created Satan whos really the problem when a program goes bad? (Those of us whove ever cursed out our laptop know that minutes later you feel a pain of hypocrisy and guilt.) But the movie is ambitious only in its beauty not its brains. Its a numbing entrancing pleasure and its fleetingly perfect in those moments when Daft Punks blippy soundtrack switches on and the green grid stretches to the horizon. Frank Capra once said ""Film is one of the three universal languages; the other two mathematics and music."" And Tron Legacy speaks each language well even if its not saying anything important.

"Movie review Tron Legacy - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-TronMovie review Tron LegacyJeff Bridges Garrett Hedlund and Olivia Wilde star in a follow-up to a 1982 cult classic. It has all that the latest 3-D has to offer but theres not nearly enough new life.December 16 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Tron Legacy"" (Disney Enterprises Inc. )""Tron Legacy"" is as much legacy as Tron. You can feel the deep imprint left by the 1982 cult classic with every flip of a light disc every zoom of a Lightcycle every wrinkle-resistant smile on Jeff Bridges computer-sanitized face. With a homage around every corner heavy hangs the crown. As it was in the beginning ""Tron Legacy"" takes us into a glow-stick world inside computers where the games are lethal and the mind can get lost albeit with new players a new story line a new director and nearly three decades of improved technology including all the whiz-bang-wow the latest 3-D has to offer. Unfortunately theres not nearly enough new life. Bridges is back playing an entire galaxy of roles a OK three variations of the Kevin Flynn video game-making genius who started the whole thing. There is his current-day self a a sort of older wiser Zen Flynn; his 20-years-younger self which should make anyone considering plastic surgery queasy; and his Clu-less self. (For any non-Tronites Clu is the ""program"" created in Flynns image that lives in the computer grid. If youre a computer ""user"" youve probably got a ""program"" in there too just FYI.) Theres a blank space between the end of ""Tron"" and the beginning of ""Legacy"" during which Kevin built a video-game empire and had a son Sam who is 7 by the time we first see dad tucking him into bed. Meanwhile his off-hours are spent teleporting back to the grid. Risky business as it happens because Kevin the real one we learn has been trapped in the grid for the last 20 years keeping himself occupied by expanding it into a trillion-watt world radiant against a perpetual dark night. So ""Legacy"" is definitely tripping the light fantastic more than ever though tripping (and I dont mean in a substance-enhancing way) more than youd wish. As most of us including Zen Flynn a flowing white robes beatific smile yoga trances and all a know too much reverence for the past can hold you back. At some point the kids need to fly solo and create their own future. Instead Joseph Kosinski an edgy commercial director making his filmmaking debut is so concerned with getting it right that he doesnt quite get ""Legacy"" where it needs to be which is to unimaginable heights of invention. As the story opens Kevins son Sam (an appealing Garrett Hedlund) is now a 27-year-old rebel with abandonment issues a souped-up motorcycle and a very cool bachelor pad paid for by the mega-conglomerate of a family business hes washed his hands of. Kevins old partner Alan (a.k.a. Tron in grid-world and reprised by Bruce Boxleitner) has been watching over the kid since Dad disappeared. One night Sam is paged back to the old Flynn video arcade. The ancient equipment that first teleported Kevin is still there and in a flash the son is following in his fathers footsteps after all a into the grid where the beautiful warrior princess Quorra (Olivia Wilde) will serve as his guide. Sams searching for his dad and sorting through those abandonment issues are what screenwriters Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz spend most of their time plotting leaving the sci-fi thrill factor in need of attention. But ""Tron"" the first was as much about the look as the story and in that ""Legacy"" doesnt disappoint. With the help of director of photography Claudio Miranda and no doubt a warehouse full of computers ""Legacy"" is beautifully constructed. The ribbons of light that trail the Lightcycles as they race across the grid are mesmerizing with the overall 3-D effect something of an ethereal stunner (and I mean that in a good way). In addition to his commercial work Kosinski studied architecture and you can feel that background infusing virtually every frame lending a modernist beauty to the morphing shapes of ""Legacy."" He takes great care in building the architecture of the grid down to the way in which light plays across space. Following the blueprint of the original action comes with the battles. Like all warriors on the side of good in the grid Sam has to be tested. Turns out hes a chip off the old watt a fast with a disc flooring it on the Lightcycles and theres a lot of racing around going on. In a nod to modern-day gender politics Wildes Quorra isnt just a tall drink of water but as much an action hero as Sam as they fight to clean up an operating system run amok. The filmmakers do try to throw in a little fun in the form of a disco run by a questionable impresario named Castor ( Michael Sheen in Al Sharpton hair and a shiny white onesie that sometimes has the added glitter of a top hat and tails) who may have clues about whats happened to Clu. Its a fabulous pulsing pleasure palace (thanks to an equally fabulous electronic score by Daft Punk) whose every surface including its patrons is illuminated. But with everything awash in all that lovely light its hard to feel that Sam or anyone else for that matter is in real jeopardy. And you wonder if the actors were blinded a bit too. They move through their paces with an OS X efficiency but not nearly enough heart. In a way ""Tron Legacy"" seems an artifact from the past its out to pay tribute to. The film arrives in an age populated by a generation or more who have spent great portions of their days obsessing over increasingly sophisticated video games built around labyrinthine challenges. They are masters of this universe one in which ""Tron Legacy"" turns out to be just an average player. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAshton Kutchers Jobs The dubious appeal of playing a...August 16 2013Bradley Cooper helps his friends get The Words outSeptember 7 2012New on DVD Tron Legacy rides on coolness factorApril 3 2011Wolfman an Oscar contender?January 26 2011Movie review Country StrongDecember 22 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTTronEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-tron-20101216,0,1403867.story",200,tronlegacy27,tronlegacy,latimes
"Messing with your TRON thing man | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMessing with your TRON thing manLike the 1982 sci-fi curiosity that spawned it TRON Legacy is an ""almost"" movie.Jeff Bridges is back in TRON Legacy.  (AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 16 2010TRON Legacy (out of 4)Starring Jeff Bridges Garrett Hedlund Olivia Wilde James Frain Beau Garrett and Michael Sheen. Directed by Joseph Kosinski. At major theatres. 126 minutes. PGLike the 1982 sci-fi curiosity that spawned it TRON Legacy is an ""almost"" movie.The original TRON in which Jeff Bridges hacker Kevin Flynn is sucked into a computer game of his own devising was significant more for what it attempted than what it achieved. Created in the pre-dawn of computer graphics it pointed to a rapidly approaching world where to use TRON lingo ""the digital frontier would shape the human condition.""Article Continued Below As dumb as the tech-heavy script was and as primitive as the graphics were (today they look like an animated black light painting) the picture was undeniably savvy about the future. It was almost there and ahead of most of the rest of us TRON came out two years before the Macintosh computer debuted and about a dozen years before the Internet went public.The long-tinkered sequel TRON Legacy is similarly on the threshold of a new world. Appealing both to nostalgists and futurists it modestly expands the original story and reunites two key cast members (Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner) while anticipating a near future of film where the aging of actors no longer matters. In this latter regard Bridges plays Flynn both old and young as a God-like ancient ruler of TRONs Grid game world; and as Clu Flynns viral and villainous digital alter-ego the beneficiary of an electronic Fountain of Youth. Clu a major reboot from the TRON original is made from Photoshopping the recreated face of a 30-something Bridges onto the body of a younger actor. The effect is simultaneously creepy and awe-inspiring and the same can be said of the look of the picture. Steeped in ice-cold hues of blue black white and orange its as if Xbox-trained director Joseph Kosinski (replacing original helmer Steven Lisberger) took the 35mm film strips of TRON and had them digitally scanned and enhanced fleshing out images that were originally little more than glowing stick figures.Add in Avatar-level 3-D and a soundtrack by French techno-ravers Daft Punk and you have an experience that could blow the minds (and ears) of aging fanboys and nouveau hipsters alike.Sadly there is the story to contend with and its another reason why TRON Legacy is almost there but not quite there. The committee-written script is framed as a ho-hum rescue mission in which Flynns 27-year-old son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) who has been messing with papas ancient game gear and oinking capitalist corporation ENCOM zaps himself to the Grid.Sam discovers a world of constant gamer warfare where the electro-heavens glower and flicker above linear patterns and robotic combatants who wear sprayed-on body armor powered by ridiculous glowing discs. Its not all silicon Sturm und Drang the scene where Sam is spontaneously suited up by a quartet of mysterious fembots is a sci-fi wet dream to rival the arrival of the libidinous Maschinenmensch robot of Metropolis. And thats just one of many movie classics that TRON Legacy references. The film also genuflects at the altars of The Wizard of Oz Star Wars Blade Runner Apocalypse Now A Clockwork Orange and 2001 A Space Odyssey to name just a few of the usual suspects.Sam is pretty good as a seeker of both love and payback but hes as understandably confused as the rest of us to discover that father Flynn hasnt just gone hes long gone daddy-o. Flynn Sr. has spent the past 28 years bearded barefoot and beatific in a literal ivory tower quaffing power-blue energy drinks (is TRON Gatorade next?) and pondering a future Utopia peopled with ""isomorphic algorithms"" who look great in Spandex.""Its bio-digital jazz man"" he proclaims to his skeptical son.Daddy Flynn is aided in his reveries by his nubile young ""apprentice"" Quorra (Olivia Wilde) whom hed probably refer to as his ""niece"" in a less spacey context. Meanwhile his evil avatar Clu and various electro-thugs are wrecking havoc in Gridland staging glowing Frisbee fights and cool chopper and airship battles to pass the time while Clu schemes. Clu wants to pass through a portal into the real world thereupon to bust badass digital moves onto dull and imperfect humans.Father and son combine forces to battle Clu squabbling all the while ""Youre messing with my Zen thing man"" Flynn Sr. complains.There is a comic interlude provided by the ever-clever Michael Sheen. Sheens Castor is a camp David Bowie figure -- a contradiction in terms perhaps? -- who dresses all in white swings an ivory cane and holds forth in a nightclub much like the Korova Milk Bar of A Clockwork Orange. Would you like a milk-plus with that?""Were not here to relive the past"" he announces staring into the camera as if to mock middle-age fanboys who are still fondling their TRON 82 glow sticks.And darned if he isnt right. While TRON Legacy isnt all there as a movie it has found a clue in the creation of Clu strongly suggesting that well soon be seeing all manner of codger thespians rolling back the years by digitally reinventing themselves as reborn action heroes.Are you ready for Indiana Jones Legacy Terminator Legacy and all the rest that this new technology implies?

"TRON Legacy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tron-legacy ) TRON Legacy (United States 2010) December 14 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in IMAX 3-D. They had 28 years and this is the best they could come up with? Its not that TRON Legacy is a complete failure. Its just that one has a right to expect a little more from a sequel this long in the making. The original TRON employed an interesting and (at the time) unique aesthetic to tell a story that was as much about ideas as it was about anything else. TRON Legacy however is a straightforward science fiction action film. The narrative may be stronger than that of the 1982 production but except for a few half-hearted allusions to Frankenstein (which are less obvious than the nods to Star Wars) theres not much interesting going on here. The movie looks cool and the action sequences are effectively rendered but ironically this TRON feels more like a video game than its predecessor. Two actors return from TRON - Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner. The former is accorded a fair amount of screen time with his dual role as the megalomaniacal villain and the Jedi-like mentor to the new hero. Boxleitner however is pushed to the side. He makes a few appearances early in the proceedings as Alan Bradley then largely disappears. Fans of his cyberspace alter-ego will be disappointed since Tron is afforded little more than a cameo. One gets the sense that the only reason Tron is in the movie is because it wouldnt make sense to use the moniker ""TRON"" in the title and leave the character out altogether. When the story opens its 2010. Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) the hero of TRON has been missing for two decades having disappeared shortly after claiming a major breakthrough in his work within cyberspace. His son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) grows up without parents. Upon reaching adulthood as the primary shareholder of ENCON Sam has the right to take an active role in the company but he is not interested in attending board meetings or becoming CEO. He has given up his father for dead despite assertions from longtime family friend Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) that all may not be as it seems. When Alan receives what appears to be a message from Flynn Sam goes to Flynns Arcade to investigate and is accidentally transported into cyberspace. There he discovers a universe ruled by Flynns alter-ego Clu (also Bridges) a cruel dictator who is opposed only by Flynn and his protA(c)gA(c) Quorra (Olivia Wilde). Sam joins forces with his father to find the way home and prevent Clu from crossing to the real world. TRON Legacys storyline lacks ambition resorting to the hackneyed clichA(c) of the power-mad ruler seeking to eliminate his lone enemy and finding new territories to conquer. Flynn saddled with the responsibility of having programming Clu with the single-minded need to create perfection has become a recluse. Tron is M.I.A. for most of the proceedings and his absence is not effectively filled by the willowy Quorra or the androgynous Zuse (Michael Sheen) who bears more than a passing resemblance to John Hurts Caligula in I Claudius. The films ending follows the expected trajectory with the last big confrontation playing out as one might anticipate. From start to finish this movies adherence to by-the-numbers screenwriter meant that it held no surprises for me. From a visual standpoint it can be said that TRON Legacy makes decent use of 3-D although its significantly less immersive here than in Avatar. At least the 3-D scenes were filmed in 3-D and not converted. The images are still dark but cyberspace is presented as a gloomy place (theres no sun) so its fitting. For the most part the 3-D is subtle enough to be unnecessary. The real-world scenes at the beginning and end were filmed (and are presented) in full color 2-D to create a contrast with the cyberspace sequences which in addition to being in 3-D rarely show much in the way of color beyond black white and red. The ""look"" of cyberspace has changed dramatically since TRON and shows the influence of how virtual reality has evolved in productions like Dark City and The Matrix. There are various homages to the original including cars zipping around tracks leaving trails behind them and discs that can be thrown at opponents to de-res them. The graphical improvements evident in TRON Legacy make it seem more like a distant relative to the original TRON than a direct descendant. Still even though its not as cutting edge as its predecessor TRON Legacy is cool to absorb. Jeff Bridges fresh off his Oscar win plays both an Obi-Wan-inspired Flynn and a youngish Clu. The computer de-aging process that shaves 20 years off Bridges features also leaves him looking a little waxy and unreal which is perfect for Clu. Bruce Boxleitner receives a similar dual treatment although Tron isnt on screen for long enough for us to get a good look. Alan appears surprisingly old; I found myself wondering when Sheridans hair had turned white. Garrett Hedlund wearing his cockiness like a badge is abrasive at times and his ability to convey emotions convincingly is limited. Olivia Wilde brings a mixture of innocence and sexiness to her role as a daughter of cyberspace although avenues that might have been explored in an R-rated script are left untouched here. The action scenes are well choreographed. They are numerous and include an updated version of the car race from TRON and an aerial dogfight. Arguably the highest octane sequence occurs early with Sam being provided with a rude introduction to the cyberspace games. In some ways this production is true to the 80s roots of its predecessor in that it derives most of its value from action and special effects. TRON delivered those things while offering more - it had a vision of the future and a cautionary message to go along with it. TRON Legacy is grounded in the present with little concern for what was or what is to come. Its eye candy a passing diversion. Disney wants this to be The Next Big Motion Picture Event but its hard to imagine a movie as ultimately superficial as TRON Legacy achieving that goal.

"TRON Legacy (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review TRON Legacy (PG) The 3D razzle-dazzle is fine but the story is D.O.A. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald12/15/2010 Editor rating 2 TRON Legacy contains a couple of sequences that deliver everything youd dreamt for out of a sequel to the 1982 groundbreaking original. Theres a fantastic light-cycle race this time played out on a multi-level grid with ramps that is genuinely thrilling and theres a neat Frisbee-disc throw down that makes the battles in the first film look like an Atari 2600 game. The 3D visuals are tremendous particularly when seen on an IMAX screen and the complex sound design which makes great use of Daft Punks fantastic score a combination of synth-pop and orchestral bombast that is just as well-crafted and polished as the eye candy. So why is the movie such an excruciating bore? First-time director Joseph Kosinski and screenwriters Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz (veterans of TVs Lost) have managed to replicate the tediousness and suffocating mood of TRON a movie that is remembered with great nostalgia by an entire generation but doesnt warrant the attention (Have you tried watching it recently?). Things start out promisingly as Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) still mourning the disappearance of his computer-whiz dad Kevin (Jeff Bridges) 20 years earlier visits his fathers shuttered videogame arcade and is sucked into the bits-and-bytes inner reality where programs walk around in humanoid form and users - i.e. humans - are treated as the enemy. The program Kevin created at the end of TRON to keep things chugging in the computer grid world Clu has become an egomaniacal despot who wants to cross over into our world and take over. TRON Legacy splits its time between the reunited father-son relationship and the requisite romantic subplot between Sam and the beautiful Quorra (Olivia Wilde) who looks like a program but may be something more. There is also much time spent on the machinations by Clu (also played by Bridges made to look younger via computer effects) to carry out his dastardly cliched plans. Why does Clu crave so much power? Why does he sit around like a Roman emperor ruling over the cybermasses with such a cruel hand? Why is it that every time Bridges Kevin says the word ""man"" (""Youre messing with my Zen thing man"") you immediately think of The Big Lebowski and wish you were watching that again instead? The problem may be an innate malfunction of TRON creator Steven Lisbergers original concept. The grid world is a great place for arena-battle spectacle but it offers nothing to engage you other than spectacle. All you notice in TRON Legacy is the impeccable art design - the way Kevins hideout has been patterned after Dave Bowmans Jupiter bedroom in 2001 A Space Odyssey or the tiny perfectly shaped cubes of ice in a drink or the cool curves and colors of the light-jets that engage in a long dogfight at the films climax. Curiously TRON Legacy makes the same mistake the original did All the best stuff comes in the first act. The rest of the movie is as exciting as an overnight round of computer coding. Didnt the hundreds of talented artists designers and animators who worked on the film ever notice how dull it was? Kosinski is currently preparing to direct a remake of another Disney dud The Black Hole that is best remembered rather than revisited. Heres hoping that this time he tries to improve on the original rather than succeed so well at recreating everything that was bad about it. More InformationTRON LegacyA Walt Disney Pictures release.

"A sequel not worth waiting for - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs A sequel not worth waiting forTRON Legacy a 2 starsDecember 15 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticBeau Garrett left and Garrett Hedlund star in Disneys ""Tron Legacy.""Imagine being ""trapped...inside an electronic arena"" This is how the coming-attractions trailer for the original ""Tron"" sold the goods back in 1982. Now comes Disneys remake of its cult property fancied up with 3-D and the high-minded title ""TRON Legacy."" The results impart that ""trapped"" feeling all too well. Its a sullen affair dominated by a grim visual palette that intrigues for about 30 minutes. Thereafter I found myself wishing I could switch over to different peppier 1982-derived artifact something on the order of Atari Pole Position. The movie does begin promisingly. I saw the 3-D version of ""TRON Legacy"" and in that version the black-light-style Magic Kingdom corporate logo alone looks groovier than any of the 3-D in Disneys recent smash ""Alice in Wonderland."" The early sequences do nicely with establishing 27-year-old Sam Flynns entry into his missing fathers universe the innards of a digital grid. There as it was in the 82 version the games are deadly like variations on ""Rollerball"" played inside a laser-tag emporium. The remake like the original stars Jeff Bridges as the computer visionary Kevin Flynn now older with a beard still spouting the ""like man"" Zen bits of wisdom and the notion that information should be ""free and open."" A digitally futzed Bridges also plays Clu Flynns self-created alter ego manipulated so that he appears not to have aged since the first ""Tron"" opened to disappointing box office returns. This is one of those big-budget projects destined to split audiences (a good thing always). Directed by Joseph Kosinski who did the ""Halo"" and ""Gears of War"" commercials ""TRON Legacy"" comes to life when Sam played by a too-cool-for-school Garrett Hedlund learns the ways of the Lightcycles and the perilous joys of racing on ""ribbons of light."" Here we get the sweep and simple excitement we need. Elsewhere we get exposition more sluggish than the stuff we had to wade through in the second and third ""Matrix"" movies and a strained opaque brand of intellectual-property mythology that might mean tons to ardent fans of the first ""Tron"" but less to others. I did enjoy the camp turn from Michael Sheen though. He plays a sinister chap who runs a stylishly low cocktail lounge inside the grid and who refers to our inexpressive young hero as a ""pretty miss"" swanning around like Annie Lennox lost in space.

Seeing it again though I think I know why. Twenty-eight years later TRON exerts a campy-surreal heres what the future looked like before it arrived fascination that it never enjoyed during its initial run. In 1982 when it was the closest thing Disney had to a picture for adults it was basically a demo reel of special effects in search of a movie. Yet if you see it today it can stand as the first prehistoric Hollywood version of cyberspace and its fun to behold the eager at times shockingly primitive ways that it imagines the ""wondrous"" computer future as a frictionless Colorforms grid that looks like the most analog of head trips. Few science-fiction films have been simultaneously so ahead of their time and so instantly touchingly dated -- so behind the eight ball of their own technology. TRON made the virtual almost leadenly literal. It was the soul of a new machine locked inside the hardware of an old one. The cult of TRON is hardly so big that you could accuse TRON Legacy of being a cynical attempt to cash in on a franchise. (More than just a bomb the first TRON was a major embarrassment for Disney; out-of-print DVD copies are now about as hard to hunt down as VHS head cleaners.) That said the studio has had a long time to ponder its mistake and TRON Legacy unlike its predecessor really does make novelty look cool. Its a sleeker sharper far more visually intoxicating machine dream of a movie with a darkly liquid electronic texture all its own. When Sam (Garrett Hedlund) the son of the now mysteriously vanished Kevin Flynn (Bridges) visits his dads dusty abandoned Flynn Arcade and ends up getting sucked -- through a TRON videogame -- into the virtual world of the Grid he gets outfitted for action (black uniform with neon piping) and then is thrust onto the combat stage of a gladiatorial thunderdome. There he faces off against assorted digital soldiers all wielding lethal Frisbees of light. The kitsch element is still there -- basically this is the story of what its like to be turned into a kill-or-be-killed videogame icon -- but the director Joseph Kosinski stages the extreme fighting with a fleet and threatening charge. The FX in TRON Legacy have an almost Einsteinian elegance They infuse light with gravity. If one of the discs hits a combatant hell shatter into glassy fragments and Sam absorbing the physics of the game must learn to treat his body almost as part of the surrounding architecture. He becomes a ruthless digital specter. As long as its engaged in light-hurling bouts of force or motorcycle chases through a landscape so ominously enveloping it looks like Blade Runner after gentrification TRON Legacy is a catchy popcorn pleasure. The movie has a seductive percolating whats-old-is-new-again musical score by the French electronica duo Daft Punk and for lengthy swatches of it I grooved on the look and the atmosphere. Joseph Kosinskis direction is just intriguing enough to leave you hoping that when Sam finally locates his father amid all those irradiated bytes and bits the story will really take off. But TRON Legacy turns out to be a little too much like one of those logy trapped-on-Planet X sci-fi movies from the 1950s Theres a lot of dramatic stasis undergirding the visual wow. It transpires that Bridges Flynn hasnt been doing much for 20 years but sitting around -- the portal that would allow him to leave has been sealed off -- and his fascist nemesis returning from the first film is once again Clu now played by a digitized version of the young Bridges. In his rubbery Botox-android way hes creepy to look at (and he makes you wonder if this will be the future for aging movie stars) but there isnt much to Clu besides his telegenic blank stare. Here as in TRON there are limits to how much technology can really express. As Flynn Bridges acts very beatnik Zen like a weary cyber version of the Dude and Michael Sheen is on hand as a sinister nightclub impresario who primps and soft-shoes like an albino Davy Jones wearing David Bowies Aladdin Sane shag. Olivia Wilde as Sams cybernetic love interest does some pretty standard punk-arm-candy posing. One reason the original TRON was greeted with so much hostility is that it seemed in its cheesy synthesized way to represent a brave new world not just of digital outer space but of movies consumed by their own effects. At the time this was a future a lot of people didnt want to see Hollywood embrace. But of course its the future that won out. And that may be the true legacy of TRON. The sequel more successfully (if less innocently) injects you into a luminous action matrix and asks you to be happy with the ride. But its easier now not to object. At the movies the fantastical-synthetic has become a state of mind that were never allowed to escape.

TRON Legacy Bad to fair Director Joseph Kosinski. Cast Jeff Bridges Garrett Hedlund Olivia Wilde. Rating PG for sequences of sci-fi action violence and brief mild language. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Jeff Bridges | Movies about racing Creator talks about development of TRONs light cycles >> Guide to this weeks new movie releases That thought occurs early during ""TRON Legacy"" and often thereafter. The story a digital-age father-and-son follow-up to 1982s ""TRON"" is a murky mess and thats just the plot. Add in unnecessarily retro-fitted 3D and the occasional hard-to-follow action scene and director Joseph Kosinskis film plays like one big question Why? Why continue the adventures of a movie that wasnt as popular as the video game it inspired? Why force-fit 3D onto it? Why not if youre going to take 28 years to make the thing wait a little longer for a decent script? Why see the thing at all? Well Jeff Bridges has half a good time in the Daft Punk soundtrack is really cool and Michael Sheen proves that no matter how small or ridiculous the role hes always worth watching. Other than that. . . . Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) is the son of Kevin Flynn (Bridges) the digital genius who disappeared 20 years ago after creating the most-popular video games ever made and legend has it stumbled upon a ""miracle."" Sam surfaces once a year to playfully menace his fathers company now a generic heartless conglomerate. But one night his fathers ally Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) gets a page from Kevin leading Sam to the family arcade. He discovers his fathers office hidden and is suddenly sucked into the grid. Almost immediately he finds himself embroiled in a sort of gladiator contest forced to fight other ""programs"" as theyre called here. The strips of neon-colored light set against the pitch-black of the grid makes for an impressive visual as do the high-speed motorcycle-like chases. But its too hard to tell whats going on how the strategies play out. Sam is brought to Clu - a digital double of Kevin Sams father but one that hasnt aged since Sam saw him. Its Bridges again by way of computer magic; the character sometimes looks indeed like a young Bridges but also goes back and forth between resembling Corey Feldman and former football coach Mike Ditka. Soon Sam is whisked away by Quorra (Olivia Wilde) and introduced to his real father Kevin aged appropriately. Kevin has created the grid and now thanks to the growing power of the nefarious Clu he is entrapped by it. There is a portal that stays open only . . . oh never mind. Just know that a showdown between Kevin and Clu - Bridges and Bridges - is brewing and its a letdown when it arrives. However that route takes us through a visit with a way-over-the-top Sheen as Zuse a Ziggy-Stardust-era-looking wheeler dealer. His character doesnt have much to do with the movie but at least hes fun. Wilde is mostly asked to look beautiful and athletic both of which she does remarkably well. Bridges is a hoot when he spouts off about New Age mumbo jumbo but it is mumbo jumbo. And Hedlund well maybe if he behaves one day his father will turn him into a real boy. One note I saw the film in IMAX 3-D and if you didnt face the screen exactly head-on the images were fuzzy which takes away from the experience. So sit up straight. ""TRON Legacy"" may well satisfy the fanboys who have waited almost three decades for its appearance. Enjoy. Who knows maybe one day if you wait long enough theyll make a ""Super Mario Bros."" sequel too. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Hoberman Tron Legacy and the Joys of the 3-D CGI Head Trip Wednesday December 15 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 TechnologyDisney Enterprises Inc. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Jeff Bridges is God and as image-captured from the original 1982 Tron hes also the devil in Disneys mega-million-dollar reboot Tron Legacy. The notion of a tragically split persona might have been scripted to give the new movie a measure of emotional gravitas but why bother with writing when Tron Legacy is so intermittently stupendiferous in its 3-D sound-and-light show?In the original Tron Bridgess game inventor Kevin Flynn hacked his employers computer to defend his intellectual property rights then somehow found himself ""in the grid"" and obliged to save the world from the tyranny of an operating system run amok. In the reboot Flynns game self an entity ""programmed for perfection"" has become the resident cyber tyrant with the middle-aged flesh-and-blood Flynn his unwilling prisoner. Years pass and young Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) abandoned as a child when Dad was sucked into the game gets lasered into the computer (dont ask) and finds himself transported to the floor-lit disco dives of neon-limned Tronland. The Eurythmics are crooning ""Sweet Dreams Are Made of This"" and a boring tale of corporate chicanery gets a blast of 80s nostalgia.For the most part Tron Legacy takes place inside a computer a geometrically severe domain somewhere between black-light Oz and Rollerball Wonderland; extending into cyberspace the logic of the old Disney ""Silly Symphonies"" many of the characters are anthropomorphized bits of computer code. However ridiculously literal-minded the premise the idea of a game programmer vanishing into his creation is still an apposite allegory and the setting is more than appropriate as just about everything worthwhile about Tron Legacy is computer-generated.The original Tron was the first movie to make extensive use of CGI. The elegantly simple mise-en-scene was a factor of the cost and the technology; back in the summer of 82 audiences were far more enchanted by E.T. (and sci-fi cinephiles impressed with Blade Runner). Tron lost 10 million a failure credited with precipitating a regime change at Disney and even setting back the development of CGI. Eventually the movie achieved cult status as the basis of a video game perhaps the first time that particular tail wagged the Hollywood dog.Disney has let the first Tron lapse out of circulation but Legacys neophyte director Joseph Kosinski shrewdly maintains even while enhancing the originals streamlined look. Not just the perfect arena for radiant Frisbee wars and zappy bumper bike contests in which the losers shatter like glass and drop into the pit of infinity Tronland distills the first few seasons of MTV. The primary colors are midnight black deep blue and electric orange. The screen is filled with glazed fembot dancers and sinister myrmidons in form-fitting body suits; pasty-faced Michael Sheen appears as the epicene master of revels. ""Come away from these primitive functions"" he coaxes Sam whos hoping to cross the Sea of Simulation back to reality.When not delighting the eye Tron Legacy which required at least four humans to script baffles the brain with mumbo-jumbo including the promise of ""a digital frontier to reshape the human condition."" Cast as a self-described ""bio-digital jazzman"" Bridges gets the least felicitous lines. ""Youre messing with my Zen thing man"" he cautions headstrong Sam after explaining that just when he thought things ""couldnt get any more profound"" his game program began spontaneously producing humanoid ""isomorphic algorithms."" The last of these so-called ISOs is his handmaiden a vinyl-sheathed dolly (Olivia Wilde) with hair bobbed a la Louise Brooks. The Weimar reference is apt. Legacys production numbers have a Langian pulp grandeur and even include a tasteless homage to Triumph of the Will.After one particularly harrowing escape the comely and compliant ISO turns to Sam and asks ""What do we do now?"" A less noble hero might have replied ""Get a room"" but Sam is vague--this is after all a Disney flick. And now that the Mouse Factory owns Marvels library its worth noting that Tron Legacys best action scenes have a cosmic headiness worthy of vintage Doctor Strange or the original Silver Surfer. Given the movies graphic pizzazz the best hippie wisdom Bridges might offer the viewer is Turn off your mind relax and float downstream.

(Photo From top David James/Courtesy of Columbia Pictures; Courtesy of Disney Enterprises; Lorey Sebastian/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) The Coens True Grit isnt as momentous an event as you might hope but once you adjust to its deliberate rhythms (it starts slowly) its a charming deadpan Western comedy. Its true that charming is an odd description for a picture with so much death and ghoulish imagery. But the Coens rarely get worked up about such things. Their gaze is steady serene. Roger Deakinss cinematography is beautifully deep-toned and austere; the compositions are clean even when the settings and characters are muddy. Hathaway shot the same old ArizonaNew Mexico buttes we know from other John Wayne movies but this True Grit is where it belongs in high deserts and forests denuded by winter. Carter Burwells elegiac score is built on Christian spirituals with a hint of Joplins piano rags to come. Its all played straightexcept when it comes to the actors. Bridgess Rooster is half-hidden behind unruly facial hair his cheeks reddened by burst blood vessels his one unpatched eye bleary. The actor has lowered his voice dropped it down into a pool of tobacco juice and phlegm and the words that come out are only semi-recognizable. It takes a while to warm up to this anti-Duke but the nice thing about Bridges is that he can wait. He catches you off guard with great Portis lines that Wayne threw away like Your partners killed you and Ive done for him. Matt Damons Texas Ranger LaBoeuf is a wonderful foil with his ostentatious jangling spurs and fringed jacket and ridiculous pipe. Hes a preener a kid playing dress-up but damned if he doesnt live up to his inflated self-image. Steinfeld is their straight man and I came to like her prim little unsmiling face and Gatling-gun delivery. It must have been hard to keep from laughing in the scene when Mattie finally comes face to face with her fathers murderer played by Josh Brolin as a bewildered troglodyte. What the hell is Brolin doing? I think I know. By this point in the film he has to out-grotesque an army of grotesqueries to make Joel and Ethan laugh. Although it falls off precipitously its better to have Julie Taymors The Tempest than not The first half-hour is nearly as unfettered as Shakespeares language. Shooting on Hawaiis Lanai where cliffs of volcanic rock border rainforest bordering desert Taymor suits the landscape to the words. Whenever the wizard Prosperoor as played by Helen Mirren Prosperasummons her enslaved spirit Ariel the screen goes electric with FX. Ben Whishaw is the genie of ones dreams semi-transparent his chiseled visage shifting in an instant from mischievousness to melancholy. He soars into the air leaving coils of himself in his wake then serenades the tempest-tossed (in songs set by Elliot Goldenthal) in an ethereal tenor. To think what Taymor might do with Puck or the three witches Even in those early scenes though there are signs of trouble. The landscape is so remarkable its hard to credit Prospera with stage-managing the shipwrecked partys illusory ordeals. And Mirren is small-scaled snippy without much variety or vocal power. Changing Prosperos sex has its ups and downs. Her brothers usurpation of her dukedom becomes an injustice against her womanhood which works fine. What doesnt is that this raging feminist would go on to use her magic to orchestrate the marriage of her naive daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones) to Prince Ferdinand (Reeve Carney). Wouldnt she want Miranda to exercise free will? I wouldbut Im biased. Jones is a dish and can speak the verse while Carney though pretty swallows his words and sings off-key. Miranda could do better. The Tempest is the most plotless of Shakespeares masterpieces and even the best productions have a hard time establishing a credible threat to Prosperos authority. The African-born Djimon Hounsou makes a grand entrance as Caliban rising nearly naked from the earth with patches of cracked soil in place of skin but hes stuck bellowing all his lines at the most misdirected troupe of comic-relief plotters (among them Russell Brand and Alfred Molina) in the annals of Shakespeare films. The drama is so muddled that Shakespeare seems to be getting in the way of Taymors spectacle the magic long gone by the time Prospera hurls her staff off into the sea. With a million times more computing power at its disposal than its 1982 predecessor Tron Legacy still looks like Disco Night at the jai alai fronton. Twenty- eight years later Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) the son of the originals Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) gets sucked into digital space where hes menaced by his fathers fascist digital double and spirited away by a gorgeous cat-eyed femme (Olivia Wilde) with a Louise Brooks do in a neon-outlined black bodysuit. (Patience Sam Flynnall your questions will be answered soon.) Given the strain of staring at this dim blue digital screen its no hyperbole to say that Wilde is a sight for sore eyes.

But as times changed Tron was re-evaluated arcade culture was now fashionably retro and as our world became increasingly digitised the films ideas of virtual reality and complex computerised systems became oddly prescient. It also didnt hurt that this coincided with Jeff Bridgess rise from dependable leading man to countercultural icon.Even so the announcement two years ago that Disney was beginning work on a sequel seemed optimistic in the extreme not only would this be the longest-gestating franchise attempt in cinema history but were there really enough retro-nerds around to make the film a genuine commercial prospect? Now thanks to a geek-targeted marketing campaign of staggering intensity Tron Legacy is one of the most anticipated multiplex releases of the season. But can the film live up to the slavish hype?The answer is... sort of. Appropriately the sequel suffers from almost the same problems as the original while its visually dazzling (particularly in 3D) thematically intriguing and fronted by the single coolest man in the universe its also empty derivative and rather directionless. We pick up the story a few years after the events of the first movie as Kevin Flynn (Bridges) waxes lyrical about the possibilities of this new technology to seven-year-old son Sam. But when Flynn goes mysteriously missing control of his company passes to a board of faceless corporate drones. Sam now a rebellious 27-year-old played by blandly handsome mediocrity Garrett Hedlund decides to go digging into the past and soon finds himself zapped into the computer and thrust onto the infamous Game Grid.Theres a lot of story in Tron Legacy pretty much every character in the computer world from Flynns digi-Hitler nemesis Clu (also played by a creepy digitally youth-ified Bridges) to Michael Sheen as bizarre pantomime Bowie-alike club owner Zeus has their personal history sketched out usually in portentous flashback. But this cant compensate for an absence of actual character development even Sam the supposed hero is little more than a winning smile and a missing-Dad complex. Bridges makes the best of an underwritten part but his amiable dedicated character from the first movie has been reduced to a shaggy Zen master spouting sub-Lebowski hippy-isms (radical man).Theres no doubting the films visual ambition the first act is essentially one breathlessly impressive action sequence making the best imaginable use of 3D technology to thrust the audience right into this gorgeous intricately detailed fantasy world. Daft Punks pulsating Moroder-esque soundtrack is another highlight as is the bands sly appropriately faceless cameo.But as the story becomes more convoluted and less convincing as entire plot strands are left hanging as Hedlund smoulders and Bridges clings to his dignity it becomes clear that this Tron isnt going to satisfy any but the most undemanding fans. The door is left wide open for a sequel and the prospect remains a welcome one - but lets hope they can do a comprehensive de-bug and get this system running smoothly once more.

Daily Edition Login to download Todd McCarthys Review of Tron Legacy 1048 AM PST 12/3/2010 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Walt Disney Pictures Verrry long-awaited sequel looks sharp in 3D and runs circles around its progenitor in effects and story which isnt saying a whole lot. TWITTER Could ""Tron Legacy"" be the first official sequel made nearly three decades after the original film? There are perhaps good reasons why Disney waited so long beginning with the obvious matter that the 1982 ""Tron"" was an awfully lame movie. Sure it deserves a footnote in film history for marking the beginning of the CGI era. But seen today the film is so incoherent and groaningly scripted as to be tolerable only if watched in a rude Mystery Science Theater 3000 frame of mind. Kids who caught the original at 12 when it came out are 40 now and may recall it through a fog of uncritical nostalgia which may help account for Disneys wise decision to delay the release of a spruced-up Blu-Ray edition until early next year (at least in Los Angeles DVDs of the first film have been essentially impossible to come by in video stores in recent weeks even in the remaining specialist shops). The mildly surprising news then is that there are aspects of Tron Legacy that are actually rather cool. Granted these mostly fall within the realms of architecture interior design and advanced motor racing techniques but they are blessed compensations nevertheless. The fact that you get two (or three depending upon how you count) incarnations of Jeff Bridges isnt a bad deal either although it all ends up being a half-hour too much of a just okay thing. Like the original the follow-up should do decent business especially in 3D engagements where the dynamic staging of the action scenes will be be seen to greatest effect but fall short of the box office Nirvana achieved by top-drawer sci-fi and fantasy films. In fact the recent film Tron Legacy most resembles -- in its lustful embrace of high technology the combat-game format corporate control angle enduring father-son allegiance and fundamental silliness -- is the Wachowskis Speed Racer. To be fair the premise of the current film is more intriguing as its built around a rescue mission in which to retrieve Dad the son must venture into the grid designed by his father but subsequently taken over by ""programs"" led by his old mans doppleganger. That the grid is a perilous place is quickly discovered by Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) who in his late 20s is still pissed that his genius pop Kevin disappeared on him a couple of decades earlier. Vengefully playing elaborate pranks on his missing fathers giant technology firm Encom zooming around city streets on his motorcycle and living a cutting edge downtown life Sam is soon lured to his old mans shuttered video arcade where he finds the long elusive key that will allow him to follow his father into another sphere. Aping the immortal moment in The Wizard of Oz when the mundane monochromatic palette of Kansas gives way to the riotous colors of Oz Tron Legacy bursts from 2D into nifty 3D at the 24-minute mark when Sam breaks through into the grid. Almost at once hes all but literally thrown to the lions when forced to put his biker background to good use (with his squinty-eyed looks and prove-it-to-me attitude Hedlund does throw off some Steve McQueen vibes) during a deadly high-speed race in a darkly suggested gladatorial-style arena seemingly big enough to accommodate the entire population of Chicago. This sequence is not only the most exciting in the film but also provides a handy point of comparison to the original and to how far digital effects have come in the intervening years. In the first Tron the race was an almost entirely geometric affair with the motorcycles traveling as if on a childs Etch-A-Sketch board and crashing into opponents contrails. It truly did feel like little more than a one-dimensional video game with no environmental component. By contrast compelling design elements are a hallmark of Legacy. Illuminated Philip Johnson-style glass enclosures hang dramatically against nocturnal backdrops while uniforms and aerodynamically designed motorcycles are strikingly defined by their lights and colors -- orange and red for the grid-based programs blue and white for the outsiders. The streaks of light combined with three-dimensional twists and turns by the rocketing bikes the eye-widening way ""programs"" disintegrate upon impact and the power techno score by Daft Punk create a novel and fully realized action set piece limited only by the anonymity of all but one of the participants. Before long director Joseph Kosinski whose background lies in high-end commercials and scripters Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz must settle down to the serious business of Sams reunion with his dad and figuring out how to extricate themselves from the prison of Kevins own devising. Turns out the inventor slipped frequently into and out of the grid for some time before his ""program"" self Clu outstripped his creator and gained the upper hand. Kevin has since been kept under house arrest in the company of beauteous warrior Quorra (Olivia Wilde) in an abode that in its immaculate whiteness looks more than a bit inspired by Keir Dulleas elegant final home in 2001 A Space Odyssey. With ruling the grid having gotten old  the megalomaniacal Clu craves crossing over into the real world setting up the battle royal between him and the makeshift Flynn clan. Despite some sharp effects notably a combat aircraft that takes shape as the ""pilot"" zooms through the air plus a bizarre turn by Michael Sheen as an obsequious white tuxed cane-wielding nightclub showman the films latter half bogs down in a redundancy of stand-offs and multiple endings.. Bearded and looking just a tad less scruffy as Kevin than he did in Crazy Heart Bridges achieves many an actors dream by convincingly appearing much younger than his real self both as Kevin in a scene set in 1989 and as fit fortyish Clu. It would be ironic if the ultimate legacy of Legacy were not as a notable sci-fi achievement but as the film that convinced middle-aged actors that they should again be considered for young romantic leads.

Visually light-years ahead of the 1982 original and yet strangely old-fashioned in the story department ""Tron Legacy"" plays like the worlds most impressive screensaver -- a flashy fetishistic showcase of what bikes and bodysuits might look like in a future designed by renegade Apple employees. While 21st-century effects and a cutting-edge dance score make this a stunning virtual ride the underlying concept feels as far-fetched as ever. Still the Disney tentpoles 3D-enhanced spectacle offers enough to draw legions to first-time director Joseph Kosinskis reverential reboot which should set high scores worldwide (compared to an OK 33 million for the earlier version). That old-vs.-new paradox traces back to the original which framed a wooden gladiator-style conflict against the backdrop of borderline-psychedelic never-before-seen CGI. And though the world is a friendlier place to gamers today than it was when Disney first beta-tested this franchise the new films four writers play it safe by conceiving their protag as the ultimate anti-nerd a young Bruce Wayne type embodied by the generically handsome Garrett Hedlund (""Troy""). The son of ultra-successful software engineer Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who disappeared into his own creation nearly 20 years earlier Sam shares none of his fathers high-tech interests. Instead under the sometime supervision of Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner downgraded from the title character in Version 1.0 to cameo status here) the trust-fund orphan gets his kicks racing cops on his Ducati and pulling stunts that undermine the profit-hungry motives of dads old company where suits (Jeffrey Nordling and an uncredited Cillian Murphy) now run the show. Drawn back to Flynns arcade Sam discovers a secret lab where a laser zaps him onto ""the grid"" -- a fully CG arena where programs take human form and genuine humans hold hallowed status. Using 3D the way ""The Wizard of Oz"" did color the film hits its pulse-racing heights early as Sam tries to intuit the rules of this virtual world while being stripped down suited up and thrust into a series of dazzling life-and-death games involving neon-lit discs and DayGlo Light Cycles while leaving the story nowhere to go but home Dorothy. Scribes Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz (from a story written with Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal) try to supply a much-needed dramatic dimension by reuniting Sam with his long-lost father which should have given the programmatic plot more of an emotional resonance. After all what 21st-century partner or parent cant relate to the idea of the men in their life preferring to live in the parallel world offered by their videogames? Thats effectively the explanation ""Tron Legacy"" offers for Kevin Flynns long-ago disappearance He became so obsessed with his cyber Second Life that he would visit it every night until his most perfect program Clu got the upper hand and trapped him there. But things stall after father and son come face-to-face reverting to yet another tired world-domination plot spearheaded by power-hungry Clu. A laid-back Bridges does double-duty here playing both Kevin (who looks like a space-age Rasputin in his long white robes) and Clu who returns the actor to his younger form via unconvincingly rendered facial performance-capture. Though Kevins waxy-cheeked clone makes a certain sense in the all-digital Tron-iverse -- despite livelier characters played by James Frain Olivia Wilde and Michael Sheen (who seems to be channeling David Bowie) -- the same technology registers as embarrassing when used to reverse-age Bridges in a real-world opening flashback. Commercials helmer Kosinski hails from a background in architecture and visual effects and what the design-oriented director lacks in narrative instinct he makes up for in large-scale vision. If ""Tron Legacys"" primary raison detre was to relaunch Lisbergers world in such a way that it could support not only movies but also games merch and themepark attractions then Kosinski more than satisfies the job requirement. Building on blueprints from that first film (including such classic vehicles as the Recognizers and the Solar Sailer) Kosinski creates a world wed love to explore for ourselves using the 3D to enhance the immersive experience Light Cycles literally materialize out of thin air while the action spills not only ""off the grid"" but off the screen as well. Every bit as important as the pics impressive visuals is its Daft Punk score which hails from an entirely different dimension from conventional film compositions establishing the tone for the whole enterprise. You dont just hear the music but feel it reverberating in your bones -- an energy on the same sonic wavelength as the films vehicles and costumes combining the flickering hum of fluorescent tubes and the insistent beat of a futuristic engine. Those bodysuits by the way are now sexy jet-black foam-latex numbers with built-in lights of various colors rather than the unflattering white spandex of the original (which vfx guys hand-illuminated via backlit animation) -- not that folks will be comparing things too closely. Although the 1982 film has its own cult-like following mostly among geeks and stoners Disney has strategically allowed the DVD to go out of print. That means younger auds will discover this slick film first buying into the sequels radically upgraded look before having a chance to revisit its clunky prototype.
