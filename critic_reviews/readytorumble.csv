(Yes even at this level quality distinctions can be made.) A witless screenplay wont trouble fans drawn in by pics World Championship Wrestling theme and lively direction by Brian Robbins (""Varsity Blues"") makes the knucklehead comedy go down painlessly enough. As recent stabs at low-end ready-made-franchise features go ""Ready to Rumble"" rates a notch below the KISS-centric ""Detroit Rock City"" and a couple above Jerry Springers ""Ringmaster"" -- in other words closer to stupid-fun than stupid-toxic. (Yes even at this level quality distinctions can be made.) A witless screenplay wont trouble fans drawn in by pics World Championship Wrestling theme and lively direction by Brian Robbins (""Varsity Blues"") makes the knucklehead comedy go down painlessly enough. But given tepid response to such bigscreen spinoffs of late major ka-ching may not be heard until ""Rumble"" is rental-ready. Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean (Scott Caan) are losers even by the standards of Lusk Wyo. -- they have jobs emptying out Porta-Potties still live with their parents and repel prospective girlfriends like Raid. Their big joy in life is watching WCW ""Monday Nitro"" matches even if Gordies cop dad carps that ""wrestlings for dirtbags and lily-pickers."" Indeed the doofus duo are probably the only employable beings alive who think such TV pec-slamming is ""for real"" -- Sean calls its fully scripted players ""heroes of history superior athletes."" When the ""Nitro"" showboat comes to Cheyenne theyre present to see personal fave and longtime heavyweight ""champion"" Jimmy King (Oliver Platt) get creamed. Truly so since latters unscrupulous manager Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano) is sick of this ""ungrateful tub of lard"" and arranges an unscripted massacre. Dazed and bruised the King seems out of the game for good. Gordie and Sean embark on a ""quest"" to restore their icons glory. Finding him soused and sulky in a trailer park they haul him off to get in shape under the tutelage of an old-school tough-as-nails trainer (Martin Landau) then finagle a Vegas rematch that will win back the Kings crown. Chief obstacles to this goal are Sinclair rival wrestler Diamond Dallas Page (appearing like many WCW personalities ""as himself"") and Rose McGowan as a booty-shaking ""Nitro Girl"" who seduces Gordie for duplicitous purposes. Given lack of any truly inspired gags let alone any notable plot turns pic could profitably have arrived at its silly flashy finale far more quickly than in 107 minutes. Scenarist Steven Brill -- from whose charmed quill sprang the first three ""Mighty Ducks"" features -- comes up with little more than a string of rote scatological lines and crotch-kicking incidents. Theres no attempt to satirize the WCW world (admittedly that may not be possible). Physical humor is strictly on the tube programs body-slammin level leaving one wistful for the more ticklesome Three Stooges-type doinks of yore. Some late-arriving half-hearted ""inspirational"" stuff -- ya gotta follow your dream etc. -- should have been left on the cutting room floor. Nonetheless and despite its eventual attenuated feel ""Rumble"" is a colorful and pacey enough no-brainer under Robbins helming. Its considerably juiced by Arquette who has done this doofus act many times before -- not always appropriately but to great effect when relevant (as in the ""Scream"" pics and his ATamp;T commercials). His over-the-top ubergeek body lingo and facial expressions render many an otherwise routine moment hilarious. (Gordies girly-man squeak of indignation on ""Wrestling is not fake"" is priceless.) The bull-necked Caan who has yet to make a defining screen impression (but looks more like his dad James Caan in every outing) provides a game if uninspired foil. Curiously the talented Platt fails to connect with a yokel role that might easily have flown in the mitts of more limited comics like Tom Arnold. Hes just OK; ditto Landau Pantoliano and McGowan. Numerous WCW wrestlers deliver their lines and noisy trademarked characters on cue. Lensing production design and other aspects are appropriately slick and garish; soundtrack benefits from numerous unimaginative but effectively chosen rock classics.

Directed and co-produced by David L. Brown . (Not rated. 68 minutes. At the Roxie.) ""Surfing for Life"" may not be intended as inspirational but to anyone older than 40 this great documentary is sure to be. That its also a gnarly first-rate surfing movie is even better. Director and co-producer David L. Brown of Brisbane known for his documentaries on nuclear issues looks at the lives of 10 older surfers as examples of exceptional health. One Northern California resident John ""Doc"" Ball is 93 and still rides chilly North Coast waves without a wetsuit. Through interviews and film footage Brown creates portraits of surfers with a youthful outlook on life because their sport keeps them fit and adds counterculture savoir faire to their sun-bleached days. Surfers profiled include big-wave legends -- among them Woody Brown 88 the famed catamaran innovator; Rabbit Kekai 79; John Kelly 81; Eve Fletcher 73; Anona Napoleon 60; Fred Van Dyke 70 -- from various walks of life. Each surfs regularly and is supremely healthy. The film though is more than a cheer for surfing geezers. It also provides a rare glimpse at the history of surfing showing its old adherents in action recording the surf and beach scene as it developed especially in California in the early days. Crank up the Surfaris and catch that south break -- Peter Stack "" SPIKE amp; MIKE "" RATING(POLITE APPLAUSE) Fourteen animated shorts. Various directors. (Not rated. 97 minutes. At the Castro.) The annual Spike amp; Mikes Classic Festival of Animation ritual begins tonight at the Castro Theatre  start of a Bay Area run through June 15. Its an event hard to top for artistic invention and fun. There are flat zones in this years outing -- the compilation of 14 films could have lost ""Village of Idiots"" a wonderfully drawn but repetitious 13-minute reworking of an old Jewish folktale. But even with its slow spots the festival is loaded with entertainment firepower. Its a true alternative to mainstream movie fare. Outstanding pieces include a trio of Oscar nominees -- ""Three Misses"" by Dutch animator Paul Driessen examining notions of heroism; the delightful ""Hum Drum"" by Aardman Animations Peter Peake about two bored shadow puppets; and the funny but touching ""When the Day Breaks"" by Canadians Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis about an urban neighborhood ""peopled"" by domestic animals. Aardman (the Wallace and Gromit studio) and animator Darren Walsh provide ""Angry Kid"" a funny series about a teenager spewing venom at his parent. Kirby Atkins ""Mutt"" is a riotous study of a stand-up-comedian dog trying to entertain fellow mutts in the pound. Visual stunners are ""Fishing"" by David Gainey and PDI the Peninsula imaging company famed for ""Antz; and ""Panther"" by Germanys Vuk Jevremovic. Its a gorgeous study of ideas about freedom based on a Rilke poem. -- Peter Stack ""SOUTHPAW"" RATING(POLITE APPLAUSE) Boxing documentary. Directed by Liam McGrath . (Not rated. At the Galaxy. 79 minutes.) Anyone who followed Olympic boxing at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta knows the outcome of Galway ""traveller"" Francis Barrett s matches but that is only half the story. This unflagging docu mentary takes it a considerable step further. It is a story of acknowledgment and loyalty. As a ""traveller"" living in rootless caravans -- a rough approximation of ""trailer trash"" in the United States -- the light-welterweight Barrett fought for recognition of his outcast clan as much as anything. Two engaging and profoundly decent personalities emerge -- the sunny but calm and centered 19- year-old boxer and Chick Gillen his mentor ""Chick the Barber"" who trained Barrett in a makeshift gym set up in a 30-foot discarded cargo container and saw him go on to carry the flag for Ireland at the Olympics. Barretts piston-driven jabs are so quick the camera almost cant catch them. A turning point comes when Barrett must decide whether to shoot for the next Olympics in Sydney or turn pro -- and is urged to take his training up to another level and leave Gillen behind. The Irish dialects heard here are a challenge at first but careful listeners will find them easier to grasp as Liam McGraths totally involving film progresses. --Bob Graham ""READY TO RUMBLE"" RATING(SNOOZING VIEWER) Comedy. Starring David Arquette  Oliver Platt  Scott Caan and Rose McGowan . Directed by Brian Robbins . Written by Steven Brill . (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Numbskull cinema scrapes new depths in ""Ready to Rumble"" a comedy about wrestling fanatics. Directed by Brian Robbins (""Varsity Blues"") it stars David Arquette and Scott Caan as Gordie and Sean die- hard wrestling fans who work for a septic-tank company. When the boys arent worshiping a washed-up wrestling star called Jimmy King (Oliver Platt) theyre vacuuming sewage from portable toilets and driving around in a truck full of waste. Their jobs are supposed to indicate what losers they are but theyre also the setup for a series of excrement jokes. Flatulent-nun jokes are also provided by screenwriter Steven Brill -- he wrote the ""Mighty Ducks"" movies -- along with body slams bitch slaps curvy babes in skimpy outfits and finger-down-the-back-of-the- pants jokes. Platt has his moments as Jimmy a bogus hick who wears a crown and cape and carries a scepter. Like the Wizard of Oz Jimmys a faker beneath the bluster a no-talent who sees pro wrestling as ""a circus show with dancing clowns."" After promoter Titus Sinclair (Joe Pantoliano) cans Jimmy Gordie and Sean find him passed out in his trailer boost his ego and orchestrate his comeback. The message Common people need heroes too and in a bogus world may be forced to invent them. Arquette is about 10 years too old to play a part like this and his charming-dweeb shtick is wearing thin. The chance to see superstar Goldberg in a two-scene cameo isnt worth the price of admission even for wrestling fans. -- Advisory Raunchy jokes foul language sexual innuendos. -- Edward Guthman ""DETERRENCE"" Drama. Starring Kevin Pollak and Timothy Hutton . Directed by Rod Lurie . (R. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) One of the pleasures of ""Deterrence"" is that it does not tell the audience what to think. Kevin Pollak plays a U.S. president who is faced with a global crisis while snowed in at a campaign stop in Colorado. Iraq has invaded Kuwait heading for Saudi Arabia. The president responds by going on television and announcing that unless Iraq withdraws he will drop a nuclear bomb on Baghdad a city of 12 million people. Is this president a decisive leader? Or is he a monster? My opinion is that he is an evil megalomaniac but not everyone will share that view. Rod Lurie a former Los Angeles film critic turned writer-director keeps his cards close to his vest. Pollak is a casting surprise. He is too young and too short ever to get elected but thats part of the movies point. Turns out this president wasnt elected but like Gerald Ford came to power by happenstance. Pollak does not have an inherent presidential presence but he takes on an imposing aura as the picture progresses. Still though the presidents bearing may be admirable it doesnt mean hes right. -- Advisory This film contains strong language. --Mick LaSalle ""GENDERNAUTS"" Documentary. Directed by Monika Treut. (Not rated. 86 minutes. At the Lumiere.) ""I didnt rent this body"" says Susan Stryker. ""Im not paying a damage deposit. Its mine to do what I want with."" Stryker a male-to-female transsexual is one of the subjects of ""Gendernauts"" an upbeat documentary that opens today. So is Max Valerio a female-to-male transsexual who describes the rush he gets from testosterone and Texas Tomboy a ""transgender cyborg"" who wont be defined as male or female. Made in San Francisco by German filmmaker Monika Treut ""Gendernauts"" explores the transgender and intersex communities of San Francisco and argues that ""male"" and ""female"" are arbitrary labels that deny the full spectrum of gender identity. Gender isnt fixed Treut suggests but an endlessly fluid continuum. She also spotlights ""sex artist"" Annie Sprinkle who calls San Francisco ""the sex capital of the entire planet""; Oakland photographer Stafford who says that ""gender confusion is a small price to pay for social progress""; and a lively ""drag king"" competition where trannies and butch women wear crotch socks and fake beards. Treut has a knack for drawing intimate relaxed portraits. She succeeds at destigmatizing her subjects -- presenting them as individuals with jobs romances and mundane concerns -- but her film doesnt run awfully deep. By taking a noncritical gaze Treut skims the risks of gender experimentation the connection between testosterone therapy and breast cancer and the possible complications of phalloplasties. -- Advisory Frank language mature subject matter nudity. -- Edward Guthman ..

Many would consider it high praise to describe a comedy set in the shock-theater burlesque world of pro wrestling as any of the following things crude rude cartoonish bombastic bone-crunching eardrum-crunching knowingly preposterous. Ready to Rumble qualifies in every category yet the movie fails to rise to the true hyperbolic vulgarity on which wrestling fans feed. Its just moronic and insulting. What for instance were the geniuses behind this movie thinking when they cast Oliver Platt as Jimmy King the undefeated hero of WCW Monday Nitro? Doughy and harmless with tiny eyes that squint in neurotic misery Platt looks like he should be playing the Cowardly Lion not a mad-dog wrestler. Its not just that hes too small; his ringside insults lack charisma and power especially in a movie that features appearances by such WCW stars as Bill Goldberg Sting and Disco Inferno. Early on Jimmy is set up for defeat by his turncoat boss (Joe Pantoliano). After getting ambushed in the ring he slinks away into humiliated anonymity and its up to Gordie (David Arquette) and Sean (Scott Caan) a couple of losers who drive a septic-tank truck to snap their idol out of his funk and return him to glory. Ready to Rumble is the sort of movie that takes a dozen raw-sewage jokes to establish that its heroes are indeed butt-heads. Actually we could have figured that out from one glance at David Arquette with his slack-jawed look-ma-Im-in-a-movie smarminess. Neither Arquette nor Caan puts enough spin on their characters; theyre straight-guy idiots. The movie does at least work up some pummeling acrobatic excitement during its final bout when Jimmy attempts to regain his crown. Then again satirizing the gladiatorial freak show that is pro wrestling--- a satire to begin with -- may be a limited proposition. It just makes you want to flip on the tube to see the real (fake) thing.
