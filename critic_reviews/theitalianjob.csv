In ""North Country"" she was a smudge-faced iron miner and single mother. In ""Monster"" she looked like the wrath of god as a foul-mouthed prostitute and serial killer and won an Oscar for her efforts. ""Young Adult"" is another story though. The movie itself directed by Jason Reitman from an original screenplay by Diablo Cody is a cockeyed comic triumph that flashes between bright and dark like a strobe light of the spirit. And Ms. Theron as Mavis Gary a self-styled author rather than a mere writer succeeds sensationally at something much harder than playing ravaged. Mavis was once prom-queen beautiful; these days in her late 30s she can still pull herself together to fairly dazzling effect. But she is also sly selfish nasty hurt and hurtful dryly sardonic and fatefully deluded. What makes her such a marvelous character is what seethes deep beneath her skin. Watch a clip from Charlize Therons latest film ""Young Adult"". Soon after her divorce a fiction writer returns to her home in small-town Minnesota looking to rekindle a romance with her ex-boyfriend who is now married with kids. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. What makes the movie marvelous is the same combination that the filmmaker and writer brought to ""Juno""--unerringly subtle yet precise direction plus a literate script with dramatic energy and a delicate tone. (Mr. Reitman directed and co-wrote ""Up in the Air"" as well.) The movies title refers to the genre of books Mavis authors or more properly ghost-writes and to Mavis herself the suggestion being that she is young for her age. But young cant begin to describe her immaturity or her failure to flourish as an adult. When we first see her in Minneapolis a slattern in a junk-strewn apartment shes living on scraps of loveless sex drinking too much and picking up snatches of kids conversations here and there then dropping them into her chronicles of Kendall Strickland the teenage heroine of a series called Waverly Prep that is in fact headed for the dustbin of subliterary history. Suddenly though the blockage in Maviss life gives way to a bizarre breakthrough and she becomes a person possessed by a mission--reclaiming the love she lost when her high-school sweetheart got married. (Hes played by Patrick Wilson.) To find her old flame she goes off to her hometown in the company of her better half a yappy canine pipsqueak named Dolce. As she drives she listens to old tapes on the cars cassette player while we see the players innards whirring and spinning in macroscopic detail; outdated technology as an access route to the listeners past and an emblem of her stunted psyche. Its a clever flourish in a film with a distinctive look (Eric Steelberg was the cinematographer and Kevin Thompson designed the production) and an exceptional cast. Mr. Wilsons Buddy quite happily married with a new baby cant fathom what Mavis is up to--his puzzled decency is painfully charming--but shes as transparent as a wine-stained carafe to an old classmate named Matt Freehauf who is played to laconic perfection by Patton Oswalt. ENLARGE Charlize Theron in Young Adult. Paramount Pictures ""Guys like me were born loving women like you"" Matt tells her ruefully. They are two of a kind with a kinship in misfortune much of it self-inflicted Matt has used the small town as a refuge since high school when a misconstrued hate crime left him significantly but far from seriously disabled. They are also a classic comic pair in a production thats chockablock with vivid characters Elizabeth Reaser as Buddys wife Beth; Collette Wolfe as Matts sister Sandra; Louisa Krause as a droll motel desk clerk. Still the movie belongs to its star at every moment shes on screen. This is partly a function of Ms. Codys script which depends on a daring supposition--that audiences will invest their attention in a heroine who from the start confronts life with a toxic vibe. (I think they will once word gets out that Mavis is as funny and surprising as she is.) Its equally a tribute to Ms. Therons fearless reach and formidable range in a role that takes her from wry comedy into something perilously close to an American tragedy. By the end and against strong odds ""Young Adult"" gives us a grown woman to weep for. ENLARGE From left David Dencik Colin Firth Toby Jones John Hurt Gary Oldman and Ciaran Hinds in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Focus Features Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy The manifold pleasures of this remarkable film are cool but intense. And theyre intensely cool in the most modern sense when it comes to Gary Oldman as John le Carres master spy George Smiley who was portrayed in the classic 1979 BBC miniseries by Alec Guinness. This Smiley doesnt let out a word for the first 18 minutes; he simply takes everything in with his steady gaze and inscrutable mien. When he finally speaks its only to say hes retired. Thats his way of resisting an invitation he knows he cant refuse--to find the Soviet mole who has infiltrated the uppermost echelon of the Circus or the British Secret Intelligence Service. (Almost all of the suspects are guilty of something though only one of them has spilled all the beans.) Film Clip ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" Withholding Smileys voice is one of many intriguing games that the film plays in the course of a Cold War mystery about spies playing sinister games of treason and personal betrayal. Tomas Alfredson the Swedish director who brought new blood to the vampire genre with ""Let the Right One In"" proves to be an inspired choice for telling Le Carres convoluted tale in less than 40% of the original 324-minute running time. And he worked from an exemplary adaptation both lucid and succinct by the husband-and-wife team of Peter Straughan and the late Bridget OConnor. (Thats not to say that I understood every part of the plot; a certain amount of confusion comes with Le Carres territory.) Where the miniseries relied on brilliant acting and long spellbinding conversations in banal settings the feature film relies on a narrative structure that sometimes feels impressionistic--shorter scenes with fluid flashbacks--while putting its own collection of topnotch performers in settings that are quietly spectacular for their visual design and their muted colors. If I seem to be stressing form over content its because the movies form serves the content so well. ""Youre a good watcher"" one of the spies tells an earnest schoolboy. Mr. Alfredson and his cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (he shot ""Let the Right One In"") make good watchers of us all by seducing us with striking images trains moving slowly on parallel tracks in a marshaling yard; a baby nursing at its dead mothers breast; an airplane materializing out of nowhere on an isolated airstrip; an archives hivelike architecture. Even a visual joke becomes an exercise in compulsive watching. It follows Smileys visit to a veteran operative who keeps honeybees in his back yard. In a scene shot from the rear we see the two men and another operative driving away in a sleek Citroen sedan. But theres a bee inside the car and no way not to watch it flitting around until Smiley lowers a window to let it out. None of this would warrant watching of course if it werent for the cast that brings the drama to life. Some of the names--Colin Firth John Hurt--are better known than others while those others including Mark Strong Toby Jones Ciaran Hinds Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy are known for their excellence on the stage as well as the screen. Yet this version of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" turns on the presence of Mr. Oldman and he is an actor of great experience and accomplishment who has finally found a film that fully deserves him. His voice so long and teasingly withheld resonates with warm regret in its lower registers--Smiley has no illusions about the role of virtue in spy craft--and with icy fury when he raises it against stupidity or deceit. His face is more often than not a mask which makes us grateful for every hint of a smile and amazed by the range of feelings he can imply without actually expressing them. Alec Guinness was a more assertive presence with a more mellifluous voice; his Smiley was also older bordering on elderly and quizzical bordering on owlish. Mr. Oldmans emphasis is on self-containment but what his Smiley seems to contain is all the wisdom of a blighted world. Corrections amp; Amplifications Collette Wolfe plays Matts sister Sandra in ""Young Adult."" An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Sandra was Matts wife. DVD Focus The Cider House Rules (1999) Charlize Theron is beautiful Candy beloved of Tobey Maguires young orphan Homer in Lasse Hallstroms entertaining and mysteriously moving version of John Irvings huge novel which the author adapted for the screen. The setting is an orphanage in 1940s Maine; the main theme is Homers search for home and family and his discovery of violence and love beyond his orphanages doors. Michael Caine is Wilbur Larch the loving ether-sniffing orphanage doctor who teaches Homer to practice obstetrics without a license. Oliver Stapleton did the luminous cinematography. The production was designed by David Gropman. The Italian Job (2003) In this jaunty remake of the 1969 original Charlize Theron gives a lovely performance as a safecracker named Stella who towers over three Mini Coopers used as getaway cars by a crew of high-tech thieves. (She drives one of them with impressive aplomb.) The movie directed by F. Gary Gray from a script by Donna Powers and Wayne Powers helped put BMWs remake of the old British Motor Mini on the map and it didnt hurt Ms. Theron either. Can it be coincidence that she drives a Mini in ""Young Adult""? Dracula (1992) Gary Oldman stars in the toothsome title role of what is also known as ""Bram Stokers Dracula"" or ""Francis Ford Coppolas Dracula""; the title variants may have been efforts to avoid litigation by Universal Studios which had laid claim to ownership of the title ""Dracula"" plain and simple. The production neither plain nor simple won Oscars for makeup costume design and sound-effects editing. Mr. Coppola directed from a screenplay that James V. Hart adapted from the Bram Stoker novel. Anthony Hopkins is Van Helsing. Winona Ryder plays the dual roles of Mina Murray and Elisabeta. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Comments The Italian Job Mark Wahlberg Charlize Theron Edward Norton Seth Green Jason Statham Mos Def and Donald Sutherland join forces in this remake of a 1969 comic heist movie that starred Michael Caine. I havent seen the original but this one offers some agreeably mindless fun in which the villains (including Norton) are truly villainous the payback is satisfying in a purely infantile way and the familiarity of everything is oddly comforting. And in terms of action this makes The Matrix Reloaded look like a clodhoppers jamboree. The settings are Los Angeles as well as Venice and other parts of Italy; F.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 30 2003 1059 AM Another Heist Movie The inspired cliches of The Italian Job. By David Edelstein The Italian Job Nice work if you can get it The Italian Job (Paramount) embodies everything that many of us have come to despise in Hollywood movies especially the ones that open between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Its a remake of a tolerable but insignificant 1969 English caper comedy Why bother? It features heroes who specialize in grand larceny Were supposed to root for them because theyre prettier and nicer than the other thieves although theyd steal from us just as casually as their mean ugly counterparts would. (They wouldnt shoot us maybe.) Its another formula revenge melodrama too One crook double-crosses a bunch of other crooks and for the next 90 minutes its payback time. And if youre sick of product placements--and whenever I see a strategically angled product in a movie I make a note to avoid buying it--youll be disgusted to know that this is basically a full-length car commercial for the MINI Cooper which gets to elude much bigger cars plus a swooping helicopter. The Italian Job is a pandering debased generic little nothing of a movie. And Im still trying to figure out why I loved it so inordinately. One reason is that after The Matrix Reloadeds ugly sets and long shapeless chase scenes it feels terrific to be back in a mini--in all senses. Directed by F. Gary Gray this is a snazzy piece of filmmaking fluid but wittily syncopated; stylish without appearing to expend undue effort. It opens with a credit sequence that gives you horizontal and vertical slats of Venice mixed with maps of the canals--and with a rare wacka-wacka score (by John Powell) that manages to be both noisy and harmonically exciting. The opening heist involves a manse above the water a safe of gold bullion a speed boat and a bunch of other elements I wont spoil. As a kid I endured week after week of that TV barbiturate Mission Impossible because I liked watching teams of crack techies snap things into place while staring anxiously at the second hands of their watches. This is the same kind of thing but smarter and faster than any Mission Impossible episode (or movie for that matter). Gray made a splash in 1996 with Set It Off a surprisingly probing bank-heist picture starring four African-American actresses. You could tell from Set It Off and The Negotiator (1998) that Gray loves pure action but he loves pure acting just as much. Advertisement Grays cast here is headed by Mark Wahlberg who doesnt always bring a lot to the party but has a plodding sweetness thats very appealing. As Charlie Croker he has a gentle rapport with Donald Sutherland as his fatherly mentor and his locked-in quality works nicely opposite Charlize Theron who plays Sutherlands straight-arrow daughter Shes one of the rare goddessy model types with a down-to-earth and playful personality. Wahlbergs team includes Mos Def as the explosives whiz with the significant moniker ""Left Ear""; the smooth Cockney Jason Statham as ""Handsome Rob"" the guy who drives the cars and distracts the birds; and Seth Green as a computer genius who wants to be called ""Napster"" because he claims he invented the technology which was swiped from him while he napped. Gray lets Green do a couple of comic improvs that almost made me forgive the actor for pricing himself out of the Buffy finale. In fact the whole cast appears unusually relaxed and inventive for such a formula picture. The double-crossing snake is played by Edward Norton who reportedly had to appear in the film because of a legal obligation to Paramount. Norton uglies himself up He wears a wormy little mustache and slits his tiny eyes instead of trying to make them button-cute. (When he first crept onto the screen I thought he was Bruno Kirby.) But hes in better form slumming than he was working hard in last years Red Dragon. When Croker and company cut the line on his TV/computer cable he gives a look of enraged entitlement thats one of the funniest things Ive ever seen him do. (It resembles my own look of enraged entitlement whenever the cable goes out.) Chalk up another point for the old repressive studio system The joke of the original The Italian Job had a barbed chauvinist edge It celebrated the orderly Brits taking advantage of the disorderly Italians. This one neednt have kept the title The efficient screenplay (by Donna Powers and Wayne Powers) has no cross-cultural underpinnings and the setting here is mainly Los Angeles. The real point of connection is those MINI Coopers. The original started a rage for them and the remake gave even a non-car guy like me a hankering to carry one off As a harried urban driver I loved the way the MINI slid neatly into itty-bitty parking spaces while still managing to accommodate the endless legs of Charlize Theron (sold separately). I know this contradicts my professed stand on product tie-ins. But car commercials and films and TV shows have been feeding on one another for decades now. (Frankly one of the best things I saw at the movies last year was that Volkswagen commercial with the bored corporate guy doing the same old thing on multiple screens until he witnesses the coming of the VW bug convertible--whereupon the Beatles-ish ELO soundtrack swells with hosannas out of a Bach cantata.) And during the ravishingly well-shot and edited climactic chase--which features red white and blue MINIs scooting around L.A.while Greens Napster gives the good guys green lights and the bad guys reds--the cars make for a hilarious visual non sequitur. Scurrying along those fat L.A. freeways and darting onto sidewalks and zipping up the walls of huge drainage tunnels theyre like hobbit-mobiles. Except theyre not a digital effect. Its a sad commentary when a basically synthetic product like The Italian Job feels more real than anything else in the multiplex. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Starring Charlize Theron Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton. Directed by F. Gary Gray. (PG-13. 104 minutes.) No one tried to make ""The Italian Job"" into a masterpiece. Instead the filmmakers made it into the ideal three-star movie. This is pure entertainment plotted and executed with invention and humor and acted by a winning cast radiating good-movie energy. F. Gary Grays direction never loses the dramatic thread in the slow scenes and never loses control in the chases. The movie is based on a Michael Caine film of the same name from 1969 but the story has been changed. The action has been moved as the story begins from Turin to Venice. Donald Sutherland as a career thief is strolling in the Piazza San Marco and talking into a cell phone to his daughter Stella (Charlize Theron). So in the first minutes we see a gorgeous plaza and a tousled Theron. Sutherland and his band of fellow thieves are led by a young master named Charlie (Mark Wahlberg). What follows is a magnificent heist that in another film might have monopolized 100 minutes of screen time but here takes up about 10. The guys want to steal a safe filled with 35 million in gold bricks from an apartment filled with armed dangerous men. If there are such things as good crooks these are the men. They dont carry guns. They dont use violence. Sutherland floats along sighing like a wistful philosopher and Wahlberg is a sensitive young artist whose art just happens to be grand larceny. The movies intention is to differentiate them from the groups bad seed Steve (Edward Norton) who double-crosses the gang and leaves them for dead. The story of ""The Italian Job"" is how the wronged thieves -- joined by Stella an expert safecracker -- reunite to steal back their money from their former friend. Stella unlike her fellows is a criminal novice and Theron and the filmmakers are wise to have her act like one. The rest of the merry band has been around the block and the picture goes out of its way to make them lovable. .This film contains violence and some strong language.

Now thats star power and more than the new version can offer. Though cast as the major maestro of elaborate gold-bar heists in Venice Italy and later Los Angeles lead Mark Wahlberg walks through the film as he did through last falls The Trouble With Charlie a slightly better movie that seriously exposed the sap in his wattage. Review of the movie The Italian Job ( out of four) Stars Mark Wahlberg Charlize Theron Edward Norton Donald Sutherland Seth Green Director F. Gary Gray Distributor Paramount RatingPG-13 for violence and some language Opens Friday nationwide Wahlberg concedes all energy to co-star Charlize Therons speed-around Mini Cooper a cute car as long as youre not hit by anything bigger than a 49 Nash if youre driving one. Somehow Edward Norton can only wangle third billing -- tiresomely reprising more or less his conniving-thief role from The Score. A player in the Venice caper Norton absconds with the bars after leaving his cohorts for dead when they illogically take the time to celebrate their steal on an isolated bridge. Wahlberg amp; Co. make it to America and recruit Therons law-abiding safe cracker to re-steal the gold from Norton. The crews comedy relief is Seth Green as a genius computer whiz who claims to have invented Napster which enables Napsters real founder (Shawn Fanning) to rate a walk-on cameo. Say whos funding these guys in all the time it takes Wahlbergs revenge scheme to get underway? The LAPD gets a rough time of it on screens nowadays but certainly it could do what a blindfolded Barney Fife could do Catch these creeps. They tie up the city drive cars inside subway stations and manipulate traffic lights (with Greens computer) to cause multiple auto wrecks at downtown intersections. Certainly theyd be all over TV and readily identified with Larry King giving the same PR to the Mini as he did for O.J. Simpsons Ford Bronco during the infamous prime-time police chase. And you have to wonder why audiences as they did at my screening laugh at the auto mishaps that Greens character orchestrates. If some geek did this to you in real life you wouldnt think twice about placing one of your front wheels squarely on his Adams apple. But not before making certain your machine was a Maxi.

Not only is this new ""Job"" a generally better movie than the satisfying 1969 caper starring Michael Caine and Noel Coward it moves through the paces with a light confident grace very much its own.

Unlike many recent remakes this one doesnt suffer from an air of desperate hipness -- the visible creative sweat that comes from moviemakers working overtime to please a younger crowd. Rather it has a cool sleekness associated with the best caper and Euro thrillers -- the most recent comparable being the equally good if much darker ""The Bourne Identity"" (also similarly troubled by negative pre-release rumors). A likeable ensemble that shows Mark Wahlberg in much better form than his previous Continental misadventure ""The Truth About Charlie"" helps ""Job"" considerably. Fans of the genre will draw numerous connections to other films and that becomes part of the fun. As it did two summers ago with ""The Score"" Paramount has released a finely-tuned heist pic and as in that thriller Edward Norton plays a thief with a hidden agenda. Wahlberg as Charlie is mastermind of the crew and cinephiles will get a kick out of seeing Donald Sutherland as John the groups wise old master safecracker back in his Venice Italy ""Dont Look Now"" haunts. First reel features larceny and some scuba gear as the crew manages to steal 35 million worth of gold bullion out of a villa. With pics theatrical trailer already giving away far too much of the twisty-turny plot its hardly revealing to note that Nortons Steve seemingly a key part of the gang double-crosses them in the Italian Dolemites kills John and thinks hes left the rest for dead. A year later in Philadelphia Johns daughter Stella (Charlize Theron) who has turned dads safecracking skills to legal use as a security consultant is approached by Charlie after hes heard that Steve is now in L.A. trying to discreetly fence the gold bars. Both Charlie and Stella have their own reasons for revenge even though Stella partially blames Charlie for dads death. Perhaps too quickly but not inconceivably Stella puts aside her hesitation about stealing the gold back from Steve and joins Charlies merry band already shown in action earlier but now formally introduced Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) is the ace driver and a major league Lothario; Left Ear (Mos Def) with a hearing impairment does munitions; and Lyle (Seth Green) the all-essential computer genius is a class clown who claims to bethe inventor of Napster. From here on ""The Italian Job"" nicely balances genre basics with refreshing angles on the set-up and execution of the caper at hand (this time in L.A.) punctuated with an unexpected sense of humor. The storytelling never stews over anything for too long so that when Rob questions Stellas ability to carry her weight or when Charlie and Stella have to work out their personal problems theyre dealt with succinctly. In tribute to the original pic the Mini Cooper car famously used in the first ""Job"" by Caines Brit crew to flee both Mafia and cops through the streets of Turin is given high profile.In fact the car is so brazenly presented its hard not to read some sequences as product placements. At first Steve doesnt see whats coming  even when Stella poses as a cable TV service rep to spy on his palatial home which contains the safe. Best-laid plans go awry though on a dinner date Steve sets up with Stella. Still Charlie ever the improviser takes advantage of the fact Steve -- now seeing the crew is alive and after his booty -- is fleeing to Mexico. The race is on turning L.A. (replacing Turin) into a giant parking lot for a spectacularly staged sequence that moves from Hollywood to Downtown including much tasty action in the subway tunnels. The only real letdown is a flat conclusion in contrast to the earlier pics terrific open-ended cliffhanger. Norton shows signs of over-familiarity with the role of the devious bad guy but in no way does this always interesting actor phone in his performance. Making small steps toward greater star confidence Wahlberg nicely assumes the posture of benevolent thief setting a grown-up but jocular tone that extends to the rest of the charismatic team. Theron adds layers of interest to Stellas character and the movie allows her to get close to Steve without the usual bogus bed scene. In support Greens measured turn as the funnyman is by far his best to date and Sutherland leaves a lasting impression. Much credit for the way pic goes down so smoothly must go to the editing team of Richard Francis-Bruce and Christopher Rouse while lenser Wally Pfister and designer Charles Wood lend a classy touch. Gary Hymes stunt work is a blast and a half and John Powell keeps a good low profile in the music department. The Italian JobProductionA Paramount release of a De Line Pictures production.

"Italian Job The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; italian-job-the ) Italian Job The (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli The 2003 version of The Italian Job is less of a straightforward remake of the 1969 picture than it is a complete re-interpretation. Enough has changed that its possible to see the two films not as the same story separated by three decades but as distinct entities. Expectedly there are plot similarities (the centerpiece heist contains many of the same elements including the minis) but the chemistry and motivations of the thieves is different and the playful semi-comedic tone of the original has been replaced by something a little less lighthearted. Its easy to do a heist movie wrong a the genre is littered with countless examples some by prominent filmmakers. F. Gary Gray has discovered the right recipe a keep things moving develop a nice rapport between the leads toss in the occasional surprise and top with a sprinkling of panache. The Italian Job isnt a masterpiece but it gets the job done. There are some problems (in particular the climactic car chase a the one featuring the minis a goes on a little too long) but for the most part I was entertained. Theres a fair amount of suspense and I was generally impressed by the thoroughness of the caper plots. Despite being called The Italian Job only about 20 minutes of the action takes place in Italy. The lions share of screen time belongs to Los Angeles with a quick stop in Philadelphia along the way. (Its worth noting that both the Venice and Philadelphia scenes appear to have been filmed on location not in a ""surrogate city"" like Toronto. This is surprisingly important to the movies strong sense of atmosphere.) There are three capers (or two and one-half depending on how you count) the most audacious and ingenious of which occurs during the final 20 minutes. The Italian Job has plenty of little twists and turns but the storyline is not so serpentine that the average viewer will find himself or herself becoming lost. Nevertheless trips to the bathroom or snack bar are not recommended. The movie opens in Venice where a group of six crooks are about to pull off the heist of a lifetime 35 million in gold and they plan to do it without holding a gun. The rogues gallery is comprised of Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) the young leader running his first big job; John (Donald Sutherland) the crusty veteran safecracker who is Charlies mentor; Lyle (Seth Green) the computer whiz who was ""the real inventor of Napster;"" Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) who once drove across the United States just so he could set the record for the longest freeway chase; Half Ear (Mos Def) who at age 10 put one too many M80s in a toilet bowl; and Steve (Edward Norton) who is about to betray the other five. Once they have the gold Steve pulls a gun on John shoots him then leaves the others for dead. A year later the group now including Johns daughter Stella (Charlize Theron) a ""professional vault amp; safe technician"" tracks down Steve and plots to take away the gold he stole from them (or whats left of it). With this film Mark Wahlberg is appearing in his third recent re-make (the other two Planet of the Apes and The Truth About Charlie). Wisely he doesnt attempt to mimic Michael Caine (who played the part in the original) but instead uses his own brand of understated charisma to get us to like Charlie. Charlize Theron who is incapable of a low-wattage performance brings some energy to her scenes with Wahlberg. Seth Green Jason Stratham and Mos Def alternately provide background muscle and comic relief. Edward Norton does his best Snidely Whiplash impersonation right down to the mustache. The Italian Job has occasional busts of smart dialogue (""There are [thieves] who steal to enrich their lives and ones who steal to define their lives"") but not enough to elevate it to the level of David Mamets most recent caper movie Heist. And while it boasts a less fatuous tone than the original (no Noel Coward or Benny Hill) there are times when it goes for the funny bone. As one of the early entries into the 2003 Summer Movie Sweepstakes The Italian Job delivers all that one could reasonably hope from it and that makes it worth squeezing in between The Matrix Reloaded and The Hulk.
