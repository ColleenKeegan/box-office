Entertainment The First Movie To Get Cyberbullying Right Unfriended may be the most cleverly made silly movie of all time but its actually a dead-on portrayal of cyberbullying. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Universal Pictures ID 5504671 The new movie Unfriended unfolds in a landscape thats familiar but markedly weird to see on a big screen -- a computer desktop cluttered with files open tabs apps and eventually communications from a vengeful social media-savvy ghost. Its a premise that seems ridiculous until you start to realize it might actually be brilliant or at least charmingly clever.Unfriended which was directed by Levan Gabriadze isnt the type of horror movie that will keep you up at night but it is the kind that wants to make people shriek and giggle more Paranormal Activity (with which it shares a producer Jason Blum) than It Follows. And Unfriended wittily fulfills these modest goals by using scenes that are part and parcel of contemporary life but rarely the stuff of cinema -- and by making those familiar sights spooky. View this image > Universal Pictures ID 5517892 We devote a lot of our time to gazing at devices a reality thats rarely reflected in movies mostly because its not interesting to watch someone else hunch over a computer or fiddle with their phone. When characters in movies use technology it usually involves feeding queries into nonexistent search engines and scanning through unfamiliar interfaces that use an awful lot of animation. Characters usually turn to devices when the plot demands it and not the way many regular people do just to hang out or because theyre bored or because they have a spare moment or because they just want to see whos saying what on whichever network.But Unfriended -- which joins two smaller cyberbullying-themed movies out in theaters the overly earnest A Girl Like Her and the witch trials-inspired The Sisterhood of Night -- showcases totally believable internet futzing around right from the start. Its main character Blaire (Teen Wolfs Shelley Hennig) home alone for the night toggles between Facebook Gmail iTunes and Instagram. Shes ensconced in the (quickly questionable) safety of her familys suburban house -- her parents like her friends arent around adding to that feeling of an online-enabled world that adults have no access to or real inkling of.Blaire video chats with a group of her friends but has a side conversation going with one of them her boyfriend Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm) in Messages. And she watches two clips online that turn out to be central to whats been haunting her and her friends. One hidden behind content warnings on LiveLeak is a wobbly shot of a girl holding a gun to her head and then shooting herself. And the other on YouTube is a video of the same girl drunk at a party and poised to humiliate herself. Its called ""LAURA BARNS KILL URSELF"" -- a suggestion that Laura (Heather Sossaman) apparently took to heart. Universal Pictures Universal Pictures ID 5525461 For all of its silliness -- its malevolent force lurks behind the default Skype avatar and does things like fill out all the fields in a form with ""I GOT HER I GOT HER I GOT HER"" -- Unfriended is one of the first movies to take on cyberbullying in the form of anything other than a well-intentioned PSA or as part of an overall ripped-from-the-headlines cautionary tale about internet use (like 2012s Disconnect or last years Men Women amp; Children). Which makes it unexpectedly also the best at approaching a serious topic that tends to get treated as an abstract epidemic in the style of an after-school special -- see ABC Familys clueless 2011 TV movie on the subject an exercise in unintentional camp. Unfriended may be current in its tech (and will date itself very quickly) but its not a sermon. Its part of the good ol slasher tradition of a group of teens being targeted by something wicked thats intent on picking them off one by one.The high school clique in Unfriended seems nice at first and then turns out to be not that nice in all sorts of unremarkable ways -- the teenagers are plagued by infidelity resentment competition minor betrayal truths that come out when the ghost (operating under Lauras old username billie227) starts posting revealing photos and videos and pitting the characters against one another. These secrets are the sort that might seem earth-shattering in the confines of teenagerdom and not that big a deal a few years out of it when the fact that your friend started a rumor that you had an eating disorder might not seem like an unforgivable act of aggression. View this image > Universal Pictures ID 5526140 Unfriended doesnt soften the language or impact of anonymous online cruelty -- it presents it as a spigot of bile that can be directed at anyone in an age where any mistake or misdeed can be captured and placed online its reach magnified for a scornful internet audience thats never held accountable for its words...except by the supernatural. The movies most painful scene more than the kills that get broken up hilariously by buffering is the one in which we finally see the full video that led to Lauras suicide.Everything shown until that point has been vague shadowed by the foreboding suggestion of a sexual assault but the reveal is actually of a less loaded (though understandable) humiliation. Its the stuff of a future embarrassing bar anecdote but in the context of an unforgiving high school social structure it feels much worse. The sense of anticlimax emphasizes the added targeting and vulnerability of young women to online abuse. Unfriended makes cyberbullying scary in several senses but it also makes it mundane the kind of thing that could happen to anyone and that doesnt only fall into stereotypical divides of alpha types and traditional targets. Lauras revenge may not be entirely earned but the movie has you rooting for her because why should she be any more measured than her former friends? Ghosts can be mean girls too.

"Unfriended | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; unfriended ) Unfriended (United States 2015) April 16 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli The average horror movie is rarely blessed with a complex storyline.  Unfriended takes this plot simplicity to an extreme. Since the movie-going experience in this case is all about the gimmick the narrative is almost nonexistent. In a strange way Unfriended does what many European films do put a bunch of characters together and have them do little more than talk for over an hour. Of course in the electronic age theres more to it than that.  The conversation takes place over video chat (none of the characters are ever physically co-located) and everyone is multi-tasking. Text chat windows are open next to the Skype screen. YouTube is omnipresent. Music is playing in the background. If nothing else Unfriended does an excellent job portraying the frenzy that is on-line teen interaction. This is the new equivalent of ""hanging out."" Its not all the different from going to a mall except everyone is in their own home and its easy to do other things without appearing to be offensive or dismissive. Without the horror element the film would exist exclusively as an anthropological examination of how a high school student spends his or her free time. But theres a ghost in the machine.  The spirit of Laura Barnes (Heather Sossaman) a junior who committed suicide after being bullied and humiliated has returned from the grave on the anniversary of her death to seek vengeance on those she views as being responsible. As luck would have it all six of them - Blaire (Shelly Hennig) Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm) Adam (Will Peltz) Jess (Renee Olstead) Ken (Jacob Wysocki) and Val (Courtney Halverson) - are online together so she begins to cyberstalk them. She invades their chat infects their computers and possesses their bodies. Unfriended turns into a variation of the Final Destination formula with characters being eliminated one-by-one in often gruesome ways. Only the poor quality of the video streams spares us from copious quantities of high-def blood and gore. The aforementioned gimmick is that the entire movie which unfolds in real time provides an image of the laptop screen of one of the characters. We see the faces of the participants as they video chat. We read the text-based side interactions. We see YouTube videos (including one of Lauras suicide). Director Leo Gabriadze is careful to make sure nothing breaks into this tenuous cyber reality because he recognizes that the suspension of disbelief curve would be impossibly steep outside of it. Things that work in this context would seem contrived (and downright silly) in a more traditional format. So although there are actors in Unfriended the star of the movie is the approach. Paradoxically it creates both a sense of immediacy (due in large part to the real time element) and distance. The latter is a problem because although theres intensity to proceedings theres no element of dread or terror. The experience is strangely sterile. Were a voyeur rather than a participant. Since theres no interpersonal interaction among the characters theres no sense of chemistry. Theyre all rather anonymous and even as secrets from their pasts are revealed they dont gain three-dimensionality. Lauras ghost is more of a plot device than a legitimate villain. In fact if one takes a step back its possible to see her as an avenging angel rather than a demon. She was after all hounded and bullied into killing herself egged on by hateful text messages and humiliated by a video. If the story was told from her perspective she would be the hero. The material is a little thin for even the short 80 minute running length. The approach starts to become tiresome around the one hour mark and even though theres no shaky-cam the limitations of the first-person perspective become obvious before the final act is over. Theres variability to the acting that the style cant cover up. None of the cast members are immediately recognizable (which is a good thing since it enhances verisimilitude) although most have a large number of TV credits to their names. Some like Shelly Hennig and Renee Olstead are convincing. Others like Will Peltz are less impressive. Unfriended is made for a specialty audience - fans of non-traditional horror movies. When it comes to selling the film to a wider viewership its quasi-unique calling card becomes a negative. Gabriadzes inability to build dread and sustain fear is also a drawback. And once it becomes apparent where things are headed Unfriended enters the realm of anti-climax. Ill admit the film held my attention but I left the theater unsatisfied which I think will be a common reaction among those not within the demographic niche for which the production was mounted.

"Clickbait The Many Open Windows of Unfriended << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Clickbait The Many Open Windows of Unfriended BLUMHOUSE Unfriended April 21 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Disposability and stupidity fuel most horror movies. Death snuffs out horny teens and carefree young adults the way humans trample ants. Some of the fun of watching the disposal comes from a sense of judgmental superiority. See? I told you not to go in there Or Run Faster Supernatural horror adds an unfair omnipresence to the genre. When Satans everywhere where do you run? Evil has to be confronted. The ants call a priest. In Unfriended the ants are on Skype. For the entire movie. And the demonic force (represented by Skypes egg-hovering-above-a-bosomy-blanket avatar) that keeps them there on this particular night screaming and crying into their webcams insists they stay -- or die. More Horror The Call Is Coming From Inside of Skype The Tech Terror of Unfriended Scared Senseless The Indie Horror Boom and What Frightens Us Now The production design limits itself to the laptop of Blaire (Shelley Hennig) a pleasant high school brunette who toggles between applications -- Spotify her web browser Skype chat windows. Her Skype calls feature as many as half a dozen windows including hers one for her nice-guy boyfriend Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm); the rest for vampy blonde Jess (Renee Olstead); douchey Adam (Will Peltz); and Ken (Jacob Wysocki) a typical jerk code jockey who in the movie is on these calls more or less to do tech support when the evening goes south. At some point someone named Val (Courtney Halverson) joins the conversation already in progress and the pre-expressed ill will for her makes sense Shes the most naturally charismatic of Blaires gathered frenemies. What a nightmare. Why pay 13 to view the screen-share of a teenager (who like everyone else here looks too old for these sorts of aimless group talks) to watch her text Mitch about the strange stuff happening on her Facebook account? Youre grateful for the egg lurking anonymously in a seventh window. Thats whos messing with Blaire whos chatting threats to the group whos posting incriminating photos of them on Facebook and who can somehow possess people long enough to make them shove their hands in blenders and shoot themselves in the head all of which happens within the ambit of a webcam. The call takes place a year to the day after their cyberbullied pal Laura killed herself. Might she -- or her ghost -- be the egg? As a production Unfriended feels labor unintensive. It was made for about a million dollars and has grossed many times more than that already. There is a credited cinematographer and editor but what do the rigors of their jobs entail here? Yet some creative challenge clearly interests the filmmakers -- Levan Gabriadze directed Nelson Greaves wrote the relentlessly prolific Jason Blum produced. This isnt a found-footage horror film. Its an exercise in nominal real-time terror that transfers the haunted house to the laptop because thats where a lot of us live now. Here the horror movie heroines sprint from the home or through the woods for help or freedom -- in a tank top or wet T-shirt -- turns into desperate clicks through Chatroulette which in this incarnation yields plenty of strangers yet not a single erect penis. The movie laughs a bit at these people especially every-teen Blaire whose open browser tabs include Forever 21 and the show page for MTVs Teen Wolf.1 Blaire is conveniently slow on the uptake in all manners of social parlance (""Whats a troll?"" she asks at one point). Her cluelessness amounts to the usual cluelessness thats crucial to the genre. When Ken sends Blaire a file to upload her MacBook freezes and she mildly freaks out. I thought Id find it mildly depressing to sit and watch a laptop screen for even 83 minutes. Each new window only calls attention to the presentations one-dimensionality. But like the Paranormal Activity movies (the supernatural; home surveillance; found footage; Jason Blum) the simplicity of the premise becomes the appeal of fearing it. Here though ""simplicity"" turns out to be another word for ""cheap."" The egg makes crazy demands forces members of the group to off themselves. But the attacks are presented with generous goosings of the soundtrack and quick flashes of nastiness that the movie disguises as a fuzzy signal. Blaire and her friends are hard to warm up to -- they turn out to be the ""assholes"" and ""dumb bitches"" they call each other (even the excellent Val). When the egg forces the surviving Skypers into a truth-telling game based on secrets the laundry is dirty enough to make you cheer for comeuppance. If this evil spirit really is Laura shes still kind of mean and her meanness is contagious. The occupant of each Skype window doubles as an argument for defenestration. Only theoretically is Unfriended scary. Hollywood has a long history of attacking rival entertainment platforms TV the VCR the Internet social media. (Just in time for the post-Golden Age television comes a summer remake of 1982s Poltergeist.) On the surface Unfriended appears to be part of the club. But technology doesnt suck. People do. Software hosts vengeance. It doesnt inspire it. Assuming otherwise would be like leaving Carrie convinced the culprit is pigs blood. In any case you notice the movie espouses a pungent awareness of the power of public shaming. You feel some mild critique of lives lived through web applications. What you dont feel is sustained visceral fright. You need more than technology for that. This is Carrie only now when the hand pops up through the grave the first thing it does is feel for a trackpad. A show that Hennig costars in.

Comments click to enlarge Unfriended Video Rated R  80 minutes  2015 Six teenagers engaged in a group chat on Skype are terrorized by the ghost of a classmate who killed herself a year earlier. In a variation on the horror subgenre of stories reconstructed from found footage this transpires entirely on the computer desktop of one character the heroine creating flashbacks by opening old photos and videos (there are some instances of glitch art as well). Theres a topical emphasis on cyberbullying which led the classmate to commit suicide; the commiserating teens are so small-minded and mean that it should come as no surprise that they were the ones bullying her.

"Unfriended - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Unfriended Posted by Christy Lemire on April 22 2015 2 Comments Universal Pictures Rated R for violent content pervasive language some sexuality and drug and alcohol use -- all involving teens. Running time 82 minutes. Three stars out of four. If youre reading this review on your laptop -- which you probably are -- then you also probably have a bunch of other windows open at the same time allowing you to multitask. Its OK -- I dont take it personally. Youre probably also shopping for clothes and chatting with friends and listening to music and checking your Facebook feed. Youre probably also making dinner for your kid or halfheartedly watching something on TV. Youre busy. I get it. Its How We Live Now if youll allow me to get all ponderous on you. But ""Unfriended"" takes the notion that were incapable of doing one thing at a time and uses it for darkly funny and ultimately startling effect. A horror flick that takes place entirely within a teenage girls laptop in real time ""Unfriended"" is a gimmick pure and simple. Its a found-footage movie meets a cabin-in-the-woods movie meets a claustrophobic thriller. But in the hands of director Leo Gabriadze and screenwriter Nelson Greaves its a gimmick that works surprisingly well. As it begins with the image of a laptop screen where someone is watching a YouTube video -- then continues to stay on the screen for the next several minutes -- you may find yourself wondering (as I did) Is this how the whole movie is going to be? How can they possibly make this last? But damned if they dont pull it off. (It really couldnt have gone on much longer than its brief running time though.) ""Birdman"" -- the best movie of last year says me -- might seem like an odd comparison but ""Unfriended"" evokes the same sense of wonder as its central stunt keeps going and going. Theres a lot that I dont want to give away because this is a movie filled with twists and revelations as its main characters connections become clearer. But Ill say this much A beautiful high school student named Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman) was the subject of a humiliating video that went viral. Soon afterward she killed herself -- the video of which also went viral. One year later a half dozen of her classmates find themselves on the same Skype chat. But joining them is an unnamed unseen visitor they cant click away from or delete -- and its using Lauras account. Seems Laura is pissed -- and she wants revenge. And somewhere in purgatory she picked up some formidable hacking skills. She can take over your Facebook page. She can play morbidly amusing songs from your Pandora collection. She can commandeer the microphone on your laptop. And -- this is crucial -- she can keep you from calling 911 on your cell phone when things start getting really gnarly. Yes this is a ridiculous premise. The makers of this movie have already thought of everything youre going to think of -- considered every answer every option. And so if you can give yourself over to the idea of ""Unfriended"" youll find its surprisingly engrossing and really quite clever. Great care has been taken with both the big ideas and the small details. Part of what makes this movie work is the authenticity of the experience. You truly feel as if youre watching our heroine -- if you can call her that since all of these characters turn out to be flawed in one way or another -- as she moves through her tabs makes decisions and responds to each new threat. Among the other pages Blaire (Shelley Hennig) has open on this night are Jezebel and Forever 21. The Facebook ads and suggested videos on the right side of the YouTube page are for the same crap you always see cute kittens crazy engagement stories and the like. You watch Blaire stop and self-edit her instant messages and begin to understand her thought processes. And you wait anxiously when some new photo or video attachment pops up for fear of the damage it might cause. Its like screaming at the screen during a traditional horror movie ""Dont open that door"" Also on the Skype call are Blaires horny boyfriend Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm); his best friend the wealthy Adam (Will Peltz); party girl Jess (Renee Olstead); bitchy queen bee Val (Courtney Halverson) and stoner clown Ken (Jacob Wysocki). If youve seen the trailer for this movie -- or if youve seen any horror movie period -- then you know its not a spoiler to say that they get picked off one by one in gory and inspired ways. Again you have to just go with it. ""Unfriended"" is a lot of fun. But hopefully its not the start of a whole franchise. Id hate to watch this movie all over again through someones iPhone.

It sounds like a 21st-century version of one of the low-budget horror flicks that Roger Corman did for AIP in the early 1960s. Short tight topical - and effective even though the premise is ludicrous. (cf ""Carnival of Souls""). Or even a latter-day ""Carnival of Souls"" or ""Mr. Sardonicus."" (Yes now Im just showing off.) Reply April 26 2015  by  Luke     the film is like if Paranormal Activity + cyber bullying + Scream had a child = Unfriended ""the film is the new face of horror"" Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

"The Call Is Coming From Inside of Skype The Tech Terror of Unfriended << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com The Call Is Coming From Inside of Skype The Tech Terror of Unfriended Blumhouse Movies April 17 2015 by Hazel Cills Facebook Twitter Print We all have those annoying friends on Facebook. Theyll tag you in unflattering pictures they send too many messages and they get touchy when you unfriend or unfollow them for doing so. But the new teen-horror flick Unfriended proves that the worst kind of Facebook friend beyond the new moms and racist old high school friends is probably a revenge-obsessed ghost. Unfriended centers on teenager Blaire Lily her boyfriend Mitch and their three friends during a typical Skype call. Its the anniversary of their friend Laura Barnss suicide; she was driven to kill herself after being cyberbullied for an embarrassing drunken video of her that ended up on YouTube. Lauras ghost has worked her way into each of the characters computers hell-bent on figuring out who wronged her and making them pay for it. Any intelligent person would just get up and walk away from their laptop but the teenagers are tied to their video call because of Lauras threats She wants them to answer her questions in order to prove their innocence. If they dont oblige they get killed off one by one. Unfriended is an effective traditional slasher flick albeit one in which the core group never splits up Theyre physically isolated but in constant digital contact. But even having their BFFs with them on webcam doesnt negate the fact that each of these teens is hopelessly alone in the face of this ghost. And while the scariest part of the film is the killings themselves and the overall terror Laura enacts a large part of what makes Unfriended delightfully stressful is how it uses the glitches of familiar apps websites and digital interfaces to build discomfort within viewers. Unfriended feeds into a lot of natural fears around the Internet nude pictures being leaked a hacker trying to make aggressive contact with you suicide-inducing cyberbullying etc. But this is also a movie about watching a computer simply fuck up over and over. The film plays literally as a static recording of Blaires Mac desktop screen following her cursor movements her typing and retyping and all the kinks in her browsing. We see her bookmarks (Free People Jezebel) her iCal alarms for studying and her trying to get it on with her boyfriend over webcam. The movie also seamlessly re-creates Facebook Spotify Safari Chatroulette iMessage and Skype using all of them to horrific and comedic effect. The ghost of Laura Barns manipulates these apps to confuse her victims. Knowing the extent of this manipulation requires an audience who knows how these apps function therefore knowing what constitutes as ""weird"" in this digital landscape. When Lauras ghost uploads a series of jeopardizing photos of the character Val on the account of another girl Jess the latter cant seem to delete them from her page citing an inability to find the removal button. In one scene a character is revealed to be lying and Laura cruelly cues up a song titled ""How You Lie Lie Lie"" on Spotify which Blaire cant pause or mute. ""Exit"" and ""Unfriended"" buttons disappear mics are tampered with and Laura types horrible things into chat windows. Unfriended also makes good use of turning completely normal computer behavior sinister. When the characters download a software program to get rid of Laura from their Skype call Blaire cant seem to force-quit her other programs and a pop-up window proclaims its because ""file MileyCyrus.SNL.Performance.avi is currently in use."" This creates an evil spinning rainbow pinwheel only this time having her computer freeze is posing actual life-threatening problems to the entire group. When Blaire clicks desperately through Chatroulette in one scene to reach a stranger who might help her she gets the usual suspects non-English speakers from outside the USA stoner bros who cant understand her and men looking to cyber. At one point a message sent to Lauras Facebook (inexplicably controlled by her evil spirit) gets a read receipt in less than a second yet no response which drew a laugh from the audience. When Blaire types and retypes a response to Lauras ghost regarding the innocence of one of their friends her hesitance and rephrasing alone gives viewers a clear unspoken and unwritten answer to the question. Its not the B-movie gore death scenes that make Unfriended squirm-inducing its how it taps in and holds on tight to how annoying the Internet and computers can be especially when theyre being tinkered with. And the variety in how the film uses apps to cause tension and terror whether it be through terrifying Facebook photo uploads or death threats printed wirelessly keeps it feeling aesthetically smart instead of like a movie equivalent of one nagging flashing pop-up box. Every ""..."" on iMessage is stressful every Facebook notification horrifying and everyones terrified to download attachments. Hell even memes have the potential to be emotionally damaging in this movie. Without the traditional mood enhancers that define horror -- like soundtrack or cinematography -- Unfriended works the discomfort of its players into seemingly innocuous everyday computer software.

Thats where we all live now anyhow so why not? Unfriended is a horror film--which is to say bad things will happen--but parents might find it scary from the first jittery moment as Skype windows squirm open with that gooey sigh a blouse is unbuttoned and bad emo rock accompanies a modern-day cyberdate. More friends crash the group chat including one mystery-blue unnamed guest and we soon learn that these kids are varying shades of awful Theyve shamed a peer into suicide by posting a video of her soiled and passed out at a party. The ghost in the machine has other plans for them though. Even though Unfriended begins to cheat springing loud noises and gory cutaways that cant be explained theres a rigor to its dopey blood-simple conception that you might smile at. Uniformly the cast does fine acting like real high-schoolers (not Hollywoods version of them). But the fear comes from two different sources one more sophisticated than the other. Theres the shouty hysteria of the supernatural pushed right up in your face--which frankly gets tired. And more insidiously theres the nightmare of programs gone haywire Windows shed their corner ""close"" buttons while pop-up ads take on an eerie intelligence. At the very least Unfriended offers a new spin on that cathartic horror-audience response ""Just leave the house"" Lets scream it together Shut the damn thing off Follow Joshua Rothkopf on Twitter joshrothkopf By Joshua Rothkopf Posted Friday April 17 2015 Details Release details Rated R Release date Friday April 17 2015 Duration 82 mins Cast and crew Director Levan Gabriadze Screenwriter Nelson Greaves Cast Matthew BohrerCourtney HalversonShelley HennigHeather Sossaman Users say LiveReviews|01 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew ReviewsRefreshShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/unfriended-2015,200,unfriended6,unfriended,timeout

One eras Do Not Pick Up the Telephone is anothers age cautionary tale of cyberbullying and anti-social media. YouTube is YouLose and Facebook is no pal of yours. A screencapture from the new Star Wars The Force Awakens trailer LucasArts/YouTube Multimedia Excitement mounts as new Star Wars The Force Awakens teaser is released Julia Garner and Matthew Rhys in The Americans. column John Doyle Whats the creepiest show on TV? The Americans Unfriended which was titled Cybernatural when it hit the festival circuit a year ago is a silicone-age terrorizer involving a pack of telegenic high schoolers and one very upset ghost who used to be a member of the clique. The latter is Laura Barns. She committed suicide after an unflattering video showing her passed out at a party made the interweb rounds. Shes a pissed-off phantom with a mischievous (but deadly serious) manner of payback.The director of Unfriended is Levan Gabriadze an unknown quantity who captures his action with nothing more than a webcam. What we have is a found-footage thriller where the actors - three girls; three guys - are shown via the home-computer screen of Blaire Lily a popular girl played by Shelley Hennig who does the scared-out-of-my-pretty-head thing very well.Gabriadze creates tension with patchy Internet connections and slow downloads. The Snapchat set will understand and the oldies might be fascinated by the communication mediums of kids today.You will recall the scary movie When a Stranger Calls. And if you dont you probably know the folk tale involving a person frightened by a prank phonester. The police are on the other line ""Weve just traced the call ... its coming from inside the house"" Except today the menace is in the online ether - if its not U2 terrorizing invasively via iTunes its a spectre typing in messages from the beyond.One of the likeable things about Unfriended is the savvy Spotify sense at work with playful musical choices such as vintage crooner Connie Conways How You Lie Lie Lie which is streamed when the kids are forced to play a game of chicken when it comes divulging the secret betrayals of their shared pasts.Watching these teens sell each other out is as chilling as any gore - give or take a bloody blender scene - we see. Best friends forever are best enemies forever apparently.Perhaps Gabriadze has created a new genre here but do we want to sit all day in front of an office computer and then go out and spend dollars to watch a small screen on a bigger screen for entertainment?In Unfriended the not-so-friendly ghost threatens doom if any of the teens hang up. If death invented the telephone it probably invented the Internet infernal too. Disconnect? The scariest thing is that we cant.

The movie follows Blaire -- or at least her screen -- as she Skypes with friends fiddles with Facebook plays songs on Spotify and checks her Gmail actions which are generally frowned upon inside movie theaters.All of which would be incredibly dull -- who goes to the movies to watch someone check their email? -- but some supernatural weirdness spices up the proceedings. Turns out Blaire is getting messages and Skype calls from a mysterious party who may or may not be Laura and when her friends start mysteriously going offline it appears the afterlife has pretty good Wi-Fi.Given that he has so little to work with director Levan Gabriadze keeps the tension level high until logic starts poking wormholes into the story. ""Unfriended"" avoids commenting on the way teenagers interact through their screens -- although its funny to watch panic ensue whenever a chat goes silent for more than three seconds -- but if it has a point about the way we treat people online its lost in an illogical ghost story that never bothers explaining itself.Yet its bare-bones approach to storytelling is something of a revelation even if its visuals tie it to 2015 the same way ""The Net"" is tied to 1995. The same way ""The Blair Witch Project"" kicked off a wave of found footage-style films ""Unfriended"" could jumpstart a new trend Computer-screen horror which will play even better on a laptop phone or iPad.

"Review Unfriended tracks lethal cyberstalker - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Unfriended tracks lethal cyberstalker .Unfriended. movie review Universal Pictures Shelley Hennig stars as Blaire in Universal Pictures ""Unfriended."" Shelley Hennig stars as Blaire in Universal Pictures ""Unfriended."" (Universal Pictures) Robert Abele Unfriended uneven but zeros in on whiplash mixture of freedom/torment we get from multitasking online lives For a solid half-hour the real-time horror film ""Unfriended"" feels breathlessly new as a storytelling portal fixed as it is on the active computer screen of teenager Blaire (Shelley Hennig) as she webchats and flirts with boyfriend Mitch (Moses Storm) checks Facebook IMs and scores her bedroom life from her playlist.Its also the one-year anniversary of Blaires friend Lauras suicide in the wake of an embarrassing video posted online. Blaires five-way Skype session with friends is interrupted by an unseen caller who claims to be seeking vengeance for Laura at which point ""Unfriended"" becomes a cyberstalking revenge flick. Everyones devices seem controlled by a secret-spilling nasty then violent ghost in the machine. Until the screaming hysterics and the killing of characters turn the movie monotonous director Leo Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves find narrative and emotional invention in their first-person single-screenshot monitor-lighted gimmick the chill from a sudden pop-up window the portent in a cursor hovering over a link (to click or not to click?) and the meaning that a typed erased then retyped message conveys.As a harangue about cyberbullying its purely exploitative but when ""Unfriended"" zeros in on the whiplash mixture of freedom and torment we get from multitasking our online lives?

Talk about low overhead I mean they didnt even need a cinematographer.The simpleton premise Its exactly one year since teenage victim Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman) committed suicide. A well-liked attractive high schooler Laura shot herself shortly after someone leaked a compromising video.The original vid has gone viral as has a smartphone-captured snuff film that shows Laura blowing her brains out.The film starts out with the snuff film - as viewed by one of the films less-heinous teens Blaire ( Ouijas Shelley Hennig). Its her computer that gives us access to the story. The action heats up (but not really) when Blaires beau Mitch (newcomer Moses Jacob Storm) joins her on Skype followed before long by three other pals Jess (Renee Olstead from The Secret Life of the American Teenager) Adam (Will Peltz In Time) and Ken (Jacob Wysocki Pitch Perfect).But wait theres a sixth person onlineomg its laura o- A Laura decides to punish the kids for leaking nasty truths and rumors about one another - to show them I guess that words can hurt real bad.""Lets play a game"" Laura IMs. ""The loser dies.""So what did I find so scary about Unfriended?It wasnt the cheap CGI ghosty visuals or the many blurry-fuzzy-video-feedback-obscured freakouts that grip the characters before they die horrible deaths. (Do ghosts somehow affect streaming-video buffering?)No I was shocked and disgusted by the bad grammar.""Never have I ever"" Laura writes ""started the rumor that Blaire has an eating disorder.""Thats just gross man.

(Universal Studios) By Ann Hornaday April 16 2015 Follow AnnHornaday ""Unfriended"" a horror thriller from the Russian producer-director team of Timur Bekmambetov and Levan Gabriadze is part of a long proud tradition of visual gimmickry pressed into service on behalf of genre from the seemingly unbroken single take of Alfred Hitchcocks ""Rope"" and Robert Montgomerys subjective camera in ""Lady in the Lake"" to the poly-format ""Project X."" Here Gabriadze gives a relatively ho-hum revenge plot an extra jolt by presenting it entirely in one take in the form of a multitasking Skype session between six friends who are maliciously threatened by a mysterious anonymous avatar. Presumably the humanoid-shaped eminence grise knows what they did last summer. And as ""Unfriendeds"" unsavory backstory unspools it turns out what they did wasnt nice at all. As chief protagonist and audience surrogate Blaire (Shelley Hennig) frantically tries to IM e-mail Google Facebook and YouTube her way out of impending doom viewers watch all the pinging dinging toggling and buffering as if they were looking over her shoulder images appearing and collapsing in now-pixelated now-lagging stutter steps. The conceit works until the headache-inducing visuals -- punctuated by manic flurries of terrified clicking and dragging -- make viewers want to call the help desk (or at least reach for the nearest dropper-bottle of Systane). The pretty fresh-faced Hennig makes a convincing damsel in distress even when she utters the preposterous question ""Whats a troll?"" Her co-stars possess the kind of bland SoCal good looks of so many TV-ready young actors these days; the cast member who makes the deepest impression is the wonderful Jacob Wysocki who was so touching as an oddball high school student in 2011s ""Terri."" Here Wysocki provides essential comic relief in a story that otherwise adds little to the crop of scary movies morbidly obsessed with the torture and early demise of hyper-sexualized adolescents. The not-so-subtle subtext of Nelson Greavess script for ""Unfriended"" is that cyberbullying is bad (while were at it stay in school) but the filmmakers overriding interest is in jacking up the suspense to make the blurrily filmed whammies land with any kind of palpable oomph. They succeed sometimes. Finally by a wacky third act twist involving Chatroulette (remember Chatroulette?) the ludicrousness of the plot seems less like a bug than a feature. At times ""Unfriended"" really clicks -- but ultimately its a drag. R. At area theaters. Contains violent content pervasive profanity some sexuality and drug and alcohol use -- all involving teens. 80 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Shelley Henning stars as Blaire in Unfriended. Universal Pictures What scares teenagers? The question has haunted horror movie producers ever since scaring teenagers became its own cottage industry and the answer usually involves finding them where they live. Decades ago the idea of psycho killers infiltrating suburbs (Halloween) dreams (A Nightmare On Elm Street) summer camps (Friday The 13th) or video stores (Scream) was enough to send jaded adolescents over the edge. So it was inevitable a new shocker in this case the MTV film Unfriended would find todays teens where they live the Internet. Set entirely on a desktop with characters only visible via webcam the film takes 82 minutes of real time to deliver its simple premise Its the anniversary of a high-school girls suicide. Six of her classmates are hanging out on a group Skype chat each sequestered in their own house their parents nowhere to be found. But theres an unknown figure on the call represented by that spooky blue ghost Skype profile. The deceased named Laura is haunting their social media as one part virus one part Slender Man and one part I Know What You Did Last Summer. She sends taunting messages from her own Facebook account commandeers the Spotify playlists and forces the kids to play the ultimate form of torture Never Have I Ever. Insult her or try to hang up on her call and she compels you to commit real-life suicide with a speed that would put Uber to shame. Call it the Internet of spooky things. Unfriended which was originally titled Cybernatural isnt the first film to take place entirely over the Internet. Some previous tech horror including the Elijah Wood-starring Open Windows already popped that bubble. But it is the first to so accurately depict the way todays youth piece together their online lives. The girl whose desktop we are peering at is Blaire (Shelley Hennig) whose life unfolds onscreen -- a digital collage as character sketch. By peering at her Facebook page YouTube videos and browsing history we know shes a hard partier with a goober boyfriend (Moses Jacob Storm) a checkered history with Laura and a Teen Wolf obsession (Hennigs recurring role on the show might explain that one). The efficient exposition is entirely composed of a LiveLeak video and half a YouTube clip. Its supremely goofy and not scary in the slightest but the movie is speaking the right language. Made for a dirt-cheap 1 million the film gets by with built-in laptop webcams terrible sound and ""buffering"" at all effects-heavy moments. Of course the digitized lo-fi look is unpleasant on a big screen but no more so than the found footage trend has been for the past several years. Having to follow the measured pace of chat forums does force the filmmakers into some degree of patience though they cant escape the horror-film curse of cheap gotcha moments and idiotic needless gore. But give credit where credit is due The film was shot in a single take. Your move Birdman. In between the silliness director Levan Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves manage a message about the dangers of cyberbullying thats like a less preachy version of the 2011 documentary Bully. Not the ghost-glitch business (a disappearing ""Unfriend"" button on Facebook isnt that spooky) but rather the more subtle touches the way the friends spread gossip about one of their own mere seconds before she joins their group chat the uploading of compromising media without permission and the casual nastiness of that common ""kill yourself"" refrain supposedly only meant as ""a joke."" By immersing us so thoroughly in this world Gabriadze has made it easy to understand why words that only exist online can hurt so deep. A communication system built by todays best and brightest minds has become a swamp of callous and evil behavior. Thats what should really keep teens up at night. That and the fear of going outside.

But the low-budget bludgeoning in Unfriended makes me want to unfriend Hollywood at least for this movies opening weekend. My problem with Levan (Leo) Gabriadzes crude flick is basic. This is a tawdry and even demeaning way to deal with the deadly serious issue of cyber-bullying in teen society. This issue is exploited not illuminated. Gabriadze turns a horrific incident and a subsequent cyber-shaming and suicide into creepy comedy. Ugh It could have been better. Unfriended at least has an original premise and an interesting claustrophobic physical setting. We the audience see everything that happens on a computer screen in Fresno Calif. We watch as a cheerful teen named Blaire (Shelley Hennig) plays sex games online with her boyfriend Mitch (Moses Storm). They are soon obliged to tone down their verbal sexcapades when they are joined by friends in a group Skype session. All the faces are visible onscreen except when Blaire flips her screen over to her email to type personal messages to Matt or onto the Internet to research stuff about dead people. These scenes are mostly boring. Mobile users click this link As the friends banter and tease a mysterious cyber-troll joins the session. She eventually identifies herself as Laura (Heather Sossaman) a girl they all knew. The ""twist"" is that Laura died exactly one year earlier committing suicide after anonymous scumbags posted an extreme drunk-and-dump video of her on the Internet. So just like the Paranormal Activity series Unfriended is a supernatural ghost story. And this ghost wants revenge for what happened to her. The question that we -- and the ghost -- want answered is what role each of the living friends had in the cyber-bullying scandal that lead to the suicide. The plot such as it is in writer-producer Nelson Greaves screenplay involves shameful secrets. Each of the participants knows and/or did something that would threaten the friendship circle if those secrets came to light. The ""ghost"" is determined to make that happen. Unfriended escalates into a lot of swearing screaming and crying -- especially when people start dying in grisly ways. These scenes are not scary but they are macabre. The movie is rough to look at as Gabriadzes filmmaking team deliberately makes the Skype session break down visually just as in reality. On the up side Gabriadze tries to capture a different kind of reality with his actors. The entire movie was repeatedly shot all in one go -- and ""the best"" take was chosen for the final release. The young actors were encouraged to improvise each time reacting to surprise changes in Greaves script. Unfriended is Gabriadzes first American movie and only his second solo effort as a director. Like Unfriendeds co-producer Timur Bekmambetov Gabriadze is a product of the former Soviet Union and both began their careers there although Bekmambetov has more experience and skill and is now shooting a remake of Ben-Hur. It is difficult to anticipate where Unfriended goes from here. If it is a hit -- and there is intense horror audience interest in it -- then the concept could be replayed just as with the Paranormal Activity movies. That franchise comes from Blumhouse Productions who also gave us The Purge and the Insidious movies and is behind Unfriended.

"Unfriended brings cyber-chilling fun review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesUnfriended brings cyber-chilling fun review Unfriended is a teen horror film for internet age featuring a group of teens menaced from beyond the grave.Blaire (Shelley Hennig) and Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm) become targets of a supernatural force seeking revenge in the cyberthriller Unfriended.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. April 16 2015UnfriendedStarring Shelley Hennig Moses Jacob Storm. Directed by Levan Gabriadze. 82 minutes. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 14A.With friends like these who can blame a teenager cyberbullied into committing suicide for returning from the grave for revenge?In fact the late Laura Barns has decided to do a little supernatural cyberbullying of her own against a group of close friends one year after fatally shooting herself an event caught on camera and cruelly posted on the web.Article Continued BelowIt is small wonder that the late Laura is so steamed. A previous video of her lying sprawled on the ground in a drunken stupor is graphically unflattering in the extreme and includes a most unkind tag line ""kill urself."" Teenagers in peril are as common in the horror genre as things that go bump in the night. But in the digital age Unfriended tries something novel putting all of the characters in the frame so to speak throughout the entire film. You only ever see them via the cameras embedded in their home computers.The films main protagonists are Blaire (Shelley Hennig) and Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm) who engage in a little cyber-romancing with a promise of prom night nookie before friends Kennington Adam and Jess show up.When Val joins in and soon becomes the first one to exit in a fatal fashion it gives the remaining five friends their first warning that something very strange and scary is afoot.None of the usual tricks they try to get rid of the mysterious faceless blue icon named billie227 has any effect and going to the website unexplainedforum.net is of no help whatever. By the time they read ""do not answer msgs from the dead"" its far too late to take heed.From there its a game of cat and mouse between the teens and billie227 whom it soon becomes clear isnt your typical internet troll. The rules as dictated by billie227 dictate that signing off means checking out for good in a grisly fashion.It also seems that each player has at least one ""dirty little secret"" which billie227 knows and uses to set them against each other. Not surprisingly tensions and panic rise as the group session progresses more or less in real time.Director Levan Gabriadze is rather hamstrung by the concept which has five or six faces bobbing on the big screen throughout. But he makes good use of the computer screen format using the blurring and freezing that often happens with digital cams to add a creepy subtext to the story.The concept also doesnt give the actors much to work with and with the earliest victims particularly much of a chance to create a character or back story. Everyone looks outraged at first that someone is impersonating poor dead Laura before eventually surrendering to panic and terror.Still Shelley Hennig manages to create a believably sympathetic character in Blaire alongside her soon-to-be-ex boyfriend Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm).The script by Nelson Greaves is clever but it doesnt entirely navigate successfully throughout with an ending that is a tad unsatisfactory. One also doesnt want to ponder too deeply about how a malevolent spirit manages to seize control of the internet and to induce her victims to dispatch themselves.Still younger audiences in particular are likely to enjoy this entertaining and fast-paced chiller. And who knows? They may even absorb the films underlying message that what you put online ""will live forever"" even if its characters dont.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

It was from a dead girl. And Blaire opening up that little cyber-door lets all kinds of nasty things in - including possession self-mutilation suicide and other ""seriously messed-up"" things. Thats the idea behind ""Unfriended"" a low-budget horror flick about a high-tech haunting that introduces us to six teenage friends all video-chatting one long boring night - until the ghost of a dead classmate joins their conversation. And turns it to talk of revenge. The monster-movie world is in need of some new horrors and for a while some of the most interesting ones were coming out of new technology - haunted videotapes spooky cell phone messages security cameras that saw things they shouldnt have. Asian cinema took the lead in this more than a decade ago and pulled off some great ones - but lately its just been one found-footage film after another long stretches of paranormal inactivity broken occasionally by a very loud noise. ""Unfriended"" is unusual though in that the entire movie takes place on Blaires laptop screen. We see what she sees there and only that - a jittery multimedia cascade of instant messages websites YouTube clips and her friends webcam feeds. Its an entire movie spent looking over someones shoulder. And thats the problem. You cant deny that its inventive or that screenwriter Nelson Greaves didnt set himself up some challenges (not only do we just see what Blaire can see on her computer - meaning that the camera never leaves her bedroom -- but the film takes place in real time too). And director Levan Gabriadze works hard to fill that single 17-inch diagonal with as many different images and bits of information as he can with every kind of cyber-flotsam crowding the tube supersizing Brian De Palmas old split-screen fetish. Except you begin to realize that the limit the filmmakers have set themselves is just that A limit. By committing to whats essentially a single feature-long shot of a computer screen theyve given up cinemas greatest (and most singular) asset - the ability to cut from image to image altering their size and composition and length to create a new emotion. Its called montage and its something only the movies have - and to discard it in favor of letting the audience decide where to look is to essentially turn a film into a play. Nor is the real-time choice an advantage either. That device can add intensity pace and realism - but it also deprives your actors of the space to create an arc. The characters in ""Unfriended"" -- and theyre not much more than Nice Girl Slut 1 Slut 2 Jock 1 Jock 2 and Fat Kid - become hysterical 10 minutes in and stay that way. And while Shelley Hennig is pleasant enough as Blaire and Moses Jacob Storm inoffensive as her boyfriend Mitch more than an hour of the two of them screaming into their own webcams is about 40 minutes too much. (Meanwhile the violence when it comes - relying mostly on murderous household appliances - is 80s-level cheesy.) Give this movie credit for trying something new - and flat-out committing to it. But just because no ones tried an idea before doesnt mean its a great one. Sometimes it just means everyone else thought better of it. Ratings note The film contains strong language substance abuse graphic violence and sexual situations. Unfriended (R) Universal (82 min.) Directed by Levan Gabriadze.

The low-res video images shimmy shake stutter and pixelate. The audio is screechy the voices shrill the trash talk dispiriting. Browser windows move and resize incessantly. The bloops and beeps of instant messaging grow maddening. So its therefore a movie to be avoided by anyone over the age of chat rooms? No its therefore a movie to be seen if you can endure it--as a shrewd commercial venture as an online opus that undoes your self-composure and last and foremost as a window on a mode...

(Universal Pictures via AP) In this image released by Universal Pictures Shelley Henning appears in a scene from ""Unfriended."" (Universal Pictures via AP) Photo Uncredited / Associated Press Unfriended dull flat despite clever gimmick 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Unfriended"" is clever energetic and original -- and dull flat and derivative. Presented entirely as the display of the protagonists laptop screen the teen-targeting horror movie depicts -- largely through group video chat -- high school friends tormented by a mysterious interloper a year after the suicide of a female classmate. The mysterious online presence that seems to know everything about them claims they were each somehow involved in the bullying that led the girl to kill herself ... is this her ghostly revenge? ""Unfriended"" has a lot going for it principally the intellectual energy in the all-on-the-computer-screen conceit and unusually good acting for the genre. There are some nice creepy touches such as messages popping up too quickly to have been typed or responses to texts that havent yet been sent. The filmmakers also figured out that unsent messages could function as subtext so kudos for that bit of cleverness. Its a relief the teens arent blithering idiots; their ultra-tech-savviness is taken as given. Some of the dialogue is fun such as when one of the boys threatens to go where the tormenter is IRL (in real life) -- the response possibly from the dead girl is ""Sounds great. But you wouldnt like it here."" Despite those thumbs-up moments however ""Unfriended"" fails its most basic mission -- to scare. It resorts to jumping out of cupboards early and often. The plot is a cyber-rehash of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and its endless ilk; yet another ghost in the machine coiling to shout ""Boo"" Sometimes characters behave logically. Sometimes. There are painfully obvious tricks to contain the action on that laptop screen. Digital bells and whistles and all the film reads as a good-old chamber drama in which fairly obvious secrets are dragged to the surface. The inevitable meltdowns feel unearned because of predictable yet unmotivated character turns. Theres no one to root for not even the dead girl. Nothing seems important enough. Even the damning bullying incident has little impact amounting to a murder spree over embarrassment. It may be that all that energy spent on presentation sapped some juice from the basic underpinnings of the script -- character development believable relationships motivation. Since the stakes seem low it becomes another death-countdown potboiler -- an 80s slasher film shot on Skype. Sadly ""Unfriended"" ends up being hard to like.

VPC(Clockwise from top left) Jess (Renee Olstead Blaire (Shelley Hennig) Adam (Will Peltz) and Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm) are cyberstalked in Unfriended.(Photo Universal Pictures)May the cyberforce not be with you.Social media and digital dallying take a creepy supernatural turn in Unfriended which introduces a new actively paranormal entity akin to the Blair Witch (   out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide). Actually given that she has no physical form just keystrokes she bears more resemblance to an otherworldly Internet troll.This malevolent force insidiously haunts six teens through the laptop screen of one character. Shes seeking revenge from beyond the grave for a humiliating video that went viral and pushed her to commit suicide.Her vengeance has the insider finesse of the savviest tech geek with a psychopathic twist.The deceased demon is the digital alter ego of Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman) who brings to mind Twin Peaks mysterious Laura Palmer. In that seminal 90s TV series the question was who killed her. Here Laura clearly took her own life but who drove her to do it is up for debate. How much blame does a clique of cyberbullies share? The film doesnt exactly answer this focusing more on dramatic tension and grisly forms of revenge.Unfriendeds vindictive tech apparition navigates through Facebook Chat Spotify and Google as well as a website that warns ""Do not answer messages from the dead.""Director Levan Gabriadze takes the played-out found footage genre of the Paranormal Activity movies and gives it a fresh spin. Each character is visible through the laptop screen of popular and upbeat Blaire (Shelley Hennig) as they video-chat.The film opens with Blaire video-chatting with her boyfriend Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm). Their sexy repartee is interrupted by the friendly intrusion of four pals and they prattle on about silly teen topics. Then out of nowhere an additional caller joins the conversation with no identifying photo just a generic icon. The mysterious newcomer is revealed as Laura Barns who has been dead for a year. Is the group being pranked? Has someone hacked the Facebook account?Blaires increasingly frenzied browsing and flurry of anxious messages amplifies the suspense. When she bangs out a message then hesitates and edits her jumbled thoughts the audience gets a sense of her emotions. The teens initial skepticism gives way to trepidation then abject terror. Along the way they turn on each other as ghostly Laura manipulates them into revealing secrets lies and personal betrayals. Their panic mounts visible at all times only through a webcam. Digital multitasking is a high-concept way of approaching the tired teen horror genre. The Scream via Skype idea is surprisingly effective though the story grows repetitive as it descends into slasher gore screeching and predictable thuds and crashes. Since the audience is familiar with the technologys format and constraints there is some sense of identification with the characters. Or at least with their keystrokes. Their activity on social networks is mundane and recognizable similar to what most of us do daily. Blowing this small-screen cyber horror tale out to the big screen makes for fresh and fearsome fun. 12 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1yyHxiO",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/04/16/unfriended-review/25838573/,200,unfriended20,unfriended,usatoday

EntertainmentMovies Unfriended Only scary in its dullness Originally published April 16 2015 at 1047 am Updated April 29 2015 at 257 pm ""Unfriended"" with Shelley Hennig and Moses Storm is about teens encountering a dead friend on Facebook. A movie review of ""Unfriended"" Consisting entirely of computer-screen shots of teens encountering a dead friend on Facebook this ""horror"" movie makes the case for a ""dislike"" button. Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic The teen horror movie ""Unfriended"" has at its core a concept that we had to know was coming essentially that a high-school girl wouldnt let a little matter of being dead get in the way of being active on Facebook. For this films mercifully brief running time we have six more-or-less faceless teens online -- three girls three boys -- joined by another one who may or may not be a girl named Laura who killed herself a year ago. Laura or whoever is acting on her behalf is understandably ticked off and soon our shrieking teenage friends are facing Terrible Cyber-Danger From Forces Unknown and ... sorry I just had to go check my email. As directed by Levan Gabriadze ""Unfriended"" unfolds entirely on a computer screen with its sound often solely consisting of the click of a mouse. Sitting in the audience you feel trapped at your desk your computer taken over by clueless people with short attention spans. Though its not entirely static -- the video windows keep changing size -- its visually a snooze and the six characters are so small and blurry that we get little sense of them. (The occasionally creepy pixilating of their faces is a nice touch though.) On ""Unfriended"" goes with the teens saying ""Ohmygod"" a lot and Laura/Not Laura leading them in the worlds dullest round of Never Have I Ever and I kept hoping a power outage would hit their neighborhood or some sort of natural disaster. Arent the movies supposed to be a break from being online all the time? Though when viewing ""Unfriended"" you might want a laptop handy -- to find something better to watch. Movie Review 1/2   Unfriended with Shelley Hennig Moses Jacob Storm Renee Olstead Will Peltz Jacob Wysocki Courtney Halverson Heather Sossaman. Directed by Levan Gabriadze from a screenplay by Nelson Greaves. 82 minutes. Rated R for violent content pervasive language some sexuality and drug and alcohol use -- all involving teens.

Itas a mean potent little movie. 284 Shares Share 262 Tweet 20 Share 2 Share Email Print Share Photo Universal Pictures Hot diggity its a new low-budget Zeitgeist horror picture a dandy one cunningly tailored to the pleasure pain and subterranean dread of teens and young adults who spend their evenings keeping tabs on one another on Skype Facebook and other social media tools -- with public shaming always just a mouse-click away. Unfriended kicks off with a YouTube video of onetime high-school queen bee Laura Barnes (played by an actress named Heather which seems right) blowing her brains out for reasons we dont know but feel pretty sure well discover eventually. This is in any case the one-year anniversary of the tragedy and if horror films have taught us anything its that vengeful ghosts pay super-close attention to the calendar. UnfriendedA -- originally titled Cybernatural (ugh) -- consists of one long beautifully faked shot of a girls computer screen. Within that screen though there are so very many screens. There are Skype boxes that show the face of the main character Blaire (Shelley Hennig) and those of her five pals -- her boyfriend his best friend a fat guy a pouty blonde and a sensitive redhead. Theres actual verbal talk a written chat and instant boxes that pop up all over for private communications among these six friends -- and one dead ex-friend. Yes we know that ghosts can turn lights off and on and possess people. But it turns out they can text too. (A nice touch on Blaires screen open tabs for Free People and Forever 21. Girl has her priorities.) There are no major plot turns in Unfriended that are not in the trailer which gives a good sense of the teens mounting confusion over being hacked by someone or something with an eerily neutral avatar (blank head atop a sort of pillowy heart). What no trailer can capture is the repetition of the clicks. In one long bit the only thing we see (and hear) is Blaire reading up on how to report abusive FB spam Blaire trying to ""unfriend"" Laura Barnes Blaire messaging her boyfriend Blaire finding a website saying what to do when a poltergeist gets into your computer ... There is no music (the only score consists of songs played by the characters themselves on their computers) so theres a lot of quiet a lot of typing a lot of those clicks -- which evoke (probably unintentionally) the weird clicking sounds coming out of vengeful Japanese/Korean wraiths in the Ring and Grudge movies. At times the streaming lags and the images pixelate the characters heads ""ghosting."" Its easy to think as you watch that social media connects us but also fragments us and that the takeaway might well be fragmentation. Dismemberment too. Itas hard to imagine what audiences of 25 years ago would have made of a film with such a de-centered mise-en-scA""ne (pardon my French). Brian De Palma and Dario Argento among others have induced jitters with the use of split screens but I canat remember ever trying to look so many places at once. These kids today Iall tell ya can handle it better than I can but Iad bet all of us came out feeling rattled by our eyesa (and brainsa) inability to rest for an hour and a half. The preview audience was unusually still most of them having come from screens and doubtless heading back to them. (The idea of watching Unfriended on a laptop scares me. Itas too meta for comfort.) The point is that the audience knows this syntax inside out. Everyone will get the joke when what is often called athe spinning wheel of deatha denotes ... you know. The cast is fine and the Georgian-Russian director Levan ""Leo"" Gabriadze plays wittily with all the visual variables. But the actual plot is typical hack-em-up nonsense the only novelty is the sheer number of secrets and lies waiting to be exposed by a demon with apparent access to video of everything the characters have ever said and done. Theyve said and done plenty that their so-called friends shouldnt hear about which prompted me to ask my 17-year-old daughter (who demanded to come to the screening) if the deceptions seemed like those in the TV series Pretty Little Liars. She said ""Dad if you compare this in your review to Pretty Little Liars youll look like you dont know what youre talking about. Its nowhere near as depressing as this movie."" Unfriended really does use everything teens cherish about their technology lifestyle against them. Its a mean potent little movie.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Writing about horror movies that present themselves as raw documentary footage is an exercise in creatively repeating yourself. How many different ways can one say ""Enough already""? Yet for every 100 played-out variations on The Blair Witch Project a single novel spin on the mock-doc formula presents itself. Unfriended a fiendishly clever new fright flick may be the most ingenious addition to the genre since the original Paranormal Activity. The film unfolds entirely within the frame lines of a teenage girls laptop screen its characters squeezed into the tiny boxes of a group video chat its protagonist toggling frantically between various browsers as her evening web time becomes an online nightmare. Theres some precedent for this premise--last years Open Windows attempted something similar as did the Joe Swanberg short in V/H/S--but the filmmakers here completely commit to their gimmick turning its limitations into benefits and exploiting the chosen technology for maximum effect. In the process they hit the refresh button on the entire found-footage format.Unfriended transpires in real time through a series of seamlessly connected long takes that put a sinister twist on the mundane interface many of us spend our days navigating. On the one-year anniversary of their classmates suicide--an extreme response to a humiliating viral video that made the social-media rounds--six high-school friends find their Skype session intruded upon by an anonymous avatar silently eavesdropping on their group conversation. Soon the teens begin receiving threatening messages from the dead girls Facebook and Messenger profiles. Damning secrets are disseminated. Incriminating photos are shared. Gradually the tactics escalate from trolling to violence. Is there a ghost in the machine or is someone acting on the behalf of the deceased?Broken down to its essence Unfriended is a slasher movie a revenge flick about a bunch of faintly unlikable kids being harassed by someone who knows what they did last April. Its the execution the sheer formal ingenuity that will make horror buffs reach for the ""like"" button. The film turns the quirks and glitches of modern technology into tools of the scaring trade. Every frozen webcam image generates suspense every interruption of the video feed is a strategic blackout. (For once its not hyperbolic to use the expression ""pinwheel of death."") The innovation extends to the films narrative tricks too as director Levan Gabriadze and screenwriter Nelson Greaves shrewdly dole out exposition through their main characters browsing habits. Instead of flashbacks there are guilty peeks at the ""see friendship"" section of Facebook. Instead of the customary third-party expert brought in to explain the horror thats happening theres an ominous message board. In one of the movies slyest moves information regarding the dead girls traumatic past is subtly revealed in a chat window as someone waffles about what she wants to say typing and retyping the words until she finds a suitably cryptic explanation.Unfriended turns out to be more entertaining than terrifying though the kill scenes--flashes of gnarly gore the buffering connection creating rhythmic cutaways to black--are suitably shocking. At times the movie operates as expert black comedy A high-stakes round of Never Have I Ever is like the opening set piece of Scream by way of the polygraph episode of Community. (No really.) But theres also a certain razor-sharp insight to the films take on cyberbullying. Like Blair Witch this is a movie about technology as a barrier; the characters use the internet as an opportunity to indulge their cruelest impulses from a safe distance. The killer in turn uses the open forum of the web as a weapon against them--laying out their crimes and secrets for the world to see disclosing the true colors they reveal only anonymously. Unfriended may be a stunt but in its diabolical employment of everything from pop-up ads to Chatroulette to Spotify it also feels very much like a horror movie of the moment. This is how we terrorize.

Not a great movie but an intriguing one.""Unknown"" is making life mighty freaky for a group of teen friends in ""Unfriended.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Story Highlights3 stars (out of 5)An encyclopedic knowledge of how teens communicate is essential to telling the story.It will be interesting to see how the film so of the moment ages.""Unfriended"" isnt a great movie -- it arguably might not even be a good one -- but theres something intriguing going on here a stab (pun intended) at a different kind of storytelling.The film written by Nelson Greaves and directed by Levan Gabriadze is a basic vengeful-ghost horror tale. But its not the story itself thats particularly interesting. Its the way its told completely on a high-school girls computer screen. Unlike some fake found-footage films that purport to be told only on cellphones and laptops only to abandon the conceit as soon as a different point of view is needed ""Unfriended"" goes all in Be it by way of Skype text messaging Google Spotify or Facebook every frame takes place in real time on the computer screen belonging to Blaire (Shelley Hennig).At the start of the movie shes looking at video seemingly captured by a cellphone of her friend Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman) committing suicide after particularly cruel cyberbullying. Its the first anniversary of Lauras death.Blaire is soon joined online by her boyfriend Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm) for some flirting that never really goes very far before theyre joined in a group video chat by their friends Jess (Renee Olstead) Ken (Jacob Wysocki) and Adam (Will Peltz).But someone else is there too only no one knows who it is -- he or she is represented by a blue box with no photo or name or other identifying information.Then Blaire starts getting Facebook messages from Laura. She assumes its Mitch playing an insensitive prank but it still freaks her out a little.And then a lot. Everyone else starts getting messages from Laura in one form of social media or another (in a nice nod to an analog world a printer even comes into play). Laura or whoever or whatever is behind this controls their computers so that anti-virus software and simple power buttons are useless. Ugly secrets are revealed or rather dragged out into the open with kicking and screaming (and screaming and screaming).Eventually things get deadly with the in-and-out reception of online video acting as a strobe effect -- seeing bits and pieces of horrific events makes them scarier than they would be seen in straightforward fashion.An encyclopedic knowledge of how modern communication works is crucial to the way these kids live their lives and the way Gabriadze tells the story. To some it may seem an exaggeration. These are the people who dont know how teenagers relate to each other. Even with the heavy supernatural elements the use of technology is far more believable here than in say Jason Reitmans heavy-handed tone-deaf ""Men Women amp; Children.""There are limitations to the format. Its hard for the actors to make much of an impression popping up as they do in little boxes on-screen. But throwaway characters who exist to be sacrificed have long been a staple of horror movies.Hennig however is quite good and has to be if the film is to succeed. Because we see the story through her eyes (literally) we see the drama inherent in the self-editing she does before she hits ""send"" on messages to Laura as she struggles with how much truth to tell her. And Wysocki captures your attention as the heavyset good-time party boy a status that will play a role in his fate.Parents play no role at all (as was the case in the far superior ""It Follows""). Its like a wired version of the Peanuts gang if Charlie Brown ever starred in a horror movie. This is essential given the copious amounts of shrieking and screaming that go on.Its interesting to wonder how the film will age given the short shelf life of technology. In two years all this might seem as dated as a dial-up modem technology not nearly advanced enough to support the action here.But for now ""Unfriended"" lives in the moment as do its characters.Until they dont.Unfriended3 stars (out of 5) Director Levan Gabriadze.Cast Shelley Hennig Moses Jacob Storm Jacob Wysocki.Rating R for violent content pervasive language some sexuality and drug and alcohol use.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

You wont get it with Unfriended. ""Set"" almost entirely on the screen of a laptop belonging to heroine Blaire (Teen Wolfs Shelley Hennig) this horror film is essentially one long video chat session between six teen friends. Well six and counting-down as the crew are systematically culled by an unseen Internet interloper claiming to be the ghost of another acquaintance who committed suicide following the dissemination of an embarrassing YouTube clip. The dialogue can get clunky At this point is there a single non-Amish high-schooler in the country who would ask ""What is a troll?"" But director Levan Gabriadze and writer Nelson Greaves keep matters moving along at a good clip and make inventive use of the online form as for example the murderer punctuates his or her assaults with tunes from Blaires music library. Though not particularly ground-breaking--last years Elijah Wood-starring Open Windows pulled the same trick and much more ambitiously--were still going to ""like"" the result.

BY Jacob Hall NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 16 2015 1200 PM Title Unfriended Film Info With Shelley Hennig. An evil spirit uses a chat room to stalk victims. (122) R Violence. Area theaters. ""Unfriended"" is a flashy new coat of paint for the ""found footage"" genre of horror movie replacing wobbly handheld cameras with webcams and Skype. Unfortunately the engine underneath that gloss is woefully familiar offering the same jump scares weve seen a thousand times before. Told entirely through the static screen of a laptop -- with Facebook and YouTube popping up to provide exposition -- ""Unfriended"" follows a standard group of teenagers whose online hangout session is interrupted by a mysterious force that means them all harm. Their tormenter offers them a challenge Stay behind their computers and play a series of sadistic ""games"" or meet a violent death. Could this mysterious interloper have something to do with the girl these kids cyberbullied into suicide a year earlier? Well does a colored wheel spin? Although directed with technical finesse by newcomer Levan Gabriadze ""Unfriended"" starts shrill and only gets louder as it goes along. By the 20-minute mark the five characters are screaming at each other. The screenplay must have been in ALL CAPS. In between all the yelling is the occasional scare as something suddenly enters the movies faux-computer-screen frame. Given the parameters the violence is surprisingly grisly and occasionally shocking. At least ""Unfriended"" is as short as a quick trolling session and the young cast particularly leading lady Shelley Hennig manage to click. Maybe the sequel will have a killer app. Tags movies movie reviews shelly hennig Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Photo Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Unfriended Running time 82 minutes. Rated R (violence profanity drugs sexuality). More funny than scary ""Unfriended"" is less about its putative subject of cyber-bullying than Hollywood finding ways to update supernatural horror film cliches to fit ever-changing American society. Setting the story in real time -- and entirely on a California teenagers Apple desktop -- not only saves lots of money for the producer (schlockmeister Jason Blum) but also works a lot better than you might expect. The virginal Blaire (Shelley Hennig) starts getting Facebook messages from someone who claims to be Laura (Heather Sossaman) on the one-year anniversary of Lauras suicide which followed an especially humiliating video posted on YouTube. Blaire quickly unfriends Laura but of course it isnt easy getting rid of her late friends ghost. Shelley Hennig and Moses Storm.Photo Universal Pictures A bent-on-vengeance Laura starts threatening Blaire and her none-too-bright pals on Skype demanding they fess up to their roles in the shaming video -- or else. There is a lot of tabbing and resizing going on as Blaire and her pals wend their way back and forth between various social media sites Instagram is interrupted by pop-up ads for X-rated webcams while Spotify provides the soundtrack. Laura who has apparently watched a lot of 80s horror movies says things like ""You each have dirty little secrets"" and ""Lets play a game and the losers gonna die"" to this increasingly terrified group. Its not exactly surprising that appalling things do start happening albeit on a special-effects budget that looks to have been well under 50. Even at 82 minutes the increasingly shrill and repetitive ""Unfriended"" starts wearing out its welcome about 10 minutes before the end. But its clever enough about social media to keep an audience engaged until then -- its especially hilarious to watch the hapless Blaire begging for help from random strangers on Chatroulette.

Heres a clutch of horny high school dopes hanging out on Skype getting doxed to death by what seems to be the vengeful ghost of Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman) a young woman who committed suicide a year before. (She had been cyberbullied.) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - We see this play out exclusively through the screen of another young womans laptop Blaire (Shelley Hennig) indulges in amusingly listless sex-chat with her boyfriend Mitch (Moses Jacob Storm) scored to songs from the Spotify account she occasionally clicks up from the taskbar. Sometimes after a scare shell Google something related to it. She exchanges tense instant messages -- we see her type a truth hesitate then erase it in favor of a more politic response. Some of these IMs go to that ghost of course which is delicious. Shell hit send and wait a breath while the filmmakers stir up fresh tension from the most banal details of our tech lives a checked box saying the message has been ""seen"" or the agonizingly slow download of a mysterious jpeg. You know the cats that in most horror films are good for a fake-out scare or two? Here ingeniously their role is played by an autoplay pop-up ad.So yes this movie is 85 minutes of watching someone else use a computer. Nelson Greavess screenplay cleverly works in YouTube an antivirus program Instagram and all the stuttering cam glitches you get from Skype IRL. It occasionally inspires the kind of frustration you feel when looking over a shoulder No dont click there you fool The films adept at the sinking somethings not right creepiness too few horror films dig into Early on one teens Facebook is hijacked to post humiliating photos of another friend -- a silly idea but theres a truer terror in the way that that ghost-hacked Facebook account wont let its owner delete them. Anyone whos ever shared something online and then thought better of it can relate especially once the outside world starts pinging in with ""OMG""s as comments. Director Levan Gabriadze summons up exquisite unease just by the way a cursor darts about a desktop.Film DetailsCritics Pick Unfriended RatingR GenreHorror Running Time82 More Info Trailer But once in a while especially as Unfriended goes on the inventive creep-outs get hijacked by plot machinations -- its scary to think the angry dead might hijack your social-media sites but its not at all when at one point they eliminate the forward-message functionality of the heroines Gmail. And not all are entirely credible At my screening a woman near me scoffed ""Why do they all have fucking printers?""Do white middle-class California teenagers have printers connected to their MacBooks? Do they even still hang out on Facebook which increasingly seems like a never-ending Throwback Thursday for millions of over-thirties who argue politics with pre-generated meme photos? Unfriended gets so much right in its portrait of how we search chat cam and connect that the small things that are off can really dig at you -- especially when you consider that this on-the-cheap horror quickie is a more accurate portrayal of online life than anything else Hollywood has ever managed. (Remember Peter Parker in Sonys no-go recent Spider-Mans searching for clues on Bing?) Like it or not -- and Im mostly clicking ""Like"" myself -- Unfriended is the one movie from 2015 youll always be able to look back at and feel something of what life was like back when even if youre not a cyberbullying white teen.The story is moralistic in the way of dumb multiplex horror. Dont want to be killed in ridiculous/inventive ways in flickering cam footage as your friends scream and refresh the feed? Then dont harass and shame young women online. Its of-the-moment enough that as one dudebro chucklehead gets offed you can imagine him hollering ""Its about ethics in game journalism"" The revenge is nasty and stupid of course -- the film makes clear that the kids bullying was rooted in insecurity in herd mentality in the dirty thrill of online anonymity. As theyre punished at their laptops the kids sins feel everyday the kind of things real kids have to train themselves not to do. In this sense the film is prescriptive even humane. Unlike the Friday the 13ths where you could get killed just for being good-looking and naked Unfriended at least avenges of-the-moment behavior that does serious social harm Dont be a troll.The actors are believable enough in one-note roles but they shout so much that I was happy to see a few get logged off forever. The films final reels are weak compared to the opening a common problem in horror -- as usual once the terrifying thing is fully established the story reverts to established formula. As the corpses pile up the scripts not clear enough on just why these kids cant get help or walk away from their computers and theres occasional time-killing filler. But even then Unfriended will suckerpunch you with a clever gag or a wicked game That ghost forces the kids into excruciating truth-telling and the payoff to that nonsense about everybody having a printer might be the movies best shock. Like those of The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity -- both of which inspire scenes here -- Unfriendeds techniques are certain to be copy-pasted into imitators some of which might improve upon it. What might be wonderful is if they were applied to something other than the jubilant murder of morally dubious teens.

So perhaps it was inevitable that we get to ""Unfriended"" the first major motion picture apparently designed to be seen on a computer. The films gimmick -- and its an effective one -- is to tell a story of supernatural vengeance entirely on one computer screen where a group of friends has assembled in a collective Skype chat. Before the end of the evening gruesome deaths will become image memes and a Spotify playlist will assume the role of a guilty conscience. Also Read Unfriended Turning Twitter Buzz Into BoxOffice Theres no denying that this is all a little ridiculous but ""Unfriended"" commits to its idea and continually finds new ways to creatively exploit it building the tension as each character reveals his or her own dark deeds thus justifying the brutal vendettas visited upon them. Weve seen the locked-room mystery; now its time for the chat-room revenge tragedy. The film opens on Blaire (Shelley Hennig ""Ouija"") clicking on pages related to the suicide of classmate Laura Barns one year earlier; Blaires boyfriend Mitch (Moses Storm) Skypes her and the two have a flirty back-and-forth before pals Jess (Renee Olstead ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"") Adam (Will Peltz ""Men Women amp; Children"") and Ken (Jacob Wysocki ""Pitch Perfect"") come bounding into their conversation. Theres a sixth person on the call with no name and no photo and while they originally assume its some sort of glitch the phantom stranger persists even after they loop in Val (Courtney Halverson ""True Detective""). Blaire starts getting mysterious messages from Lauras old Facebook page and it soon becomes evident that the mystery hanger-on is Laura herself here to torment the old ""friends"" who posted an embarrassing YouTube clip that pushed her to end her own life. See Video Insidious 3 Trailer Teases Origins of Blumhouse Horror Franchise (Video) Developed by Timur Bekmambetov (""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"") written by Nelson Greaves and directed by Russian filmmaker Leo Gabriadze ""Unfriended"" has a canny sense of how computers have become for most of us a conduit to the world. When a pull-down menu on Facebook is missing the ""Unfriend"" command or when a Gmail has no ""Forward"" option the audience immediately knows that theres something amiss. That annoying spinning-beach-ball icon has never seemed as horrifyingly portentous. On paper the idea of an entire real-time movie set in a Skype conversation seems like it would work only as a short subject if at all but ""Unfriended"" keeps upping its own ante cluing us in that the traditional plot solutions -- calling the police running security software -- will do no good against Laura and her righteous wrath. The filmmakers also get plenty of mileage out of that creepy pixilation effect that happens during live video chat. Also Read Rodrigo Santoro to Play Jesus Christ in Ben-Hur ""Unfriended"" is neither as silly as it might look nor as terrifying as its ""Titus Andronicus""-via-Mark-Zuckerberg set-up promises but it takes a high-concept yet bare-bones premise and milks it for all the jolts it can. It has the same bargain-basement chill appeal as the first ""Paranormal Activity"" -- but please no sequels. ""Unfriended"" makes its online-terror premise work but theres nothing left for version 2.0. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

(""Unfriended"" was reviewed under its original title ""Cybernatural"" at the 2014 Fantasia Film Festival.) A victim of cyberbullying gets her revenge on the teens responsible for her suicide in ""Cybernatural"" a horror movie distinguished by the device that everything takes place on one characters computer screen. That means the entire story unfolds via Google Facebook Skype and other portals that probably didnt give their permission for their brands to be used and could cause trouble for this low-budget stunt -- which was the buzzy breakout of the genre-focused Fantasia fest -- in reaching mainstream audiences. Innovating what could be considered Found Footage 2.0 director Levan Gabriadze got there first(ish) though others will surely improve upon the gimmick. Simultaneously clever and exasperating the film puts a novel spin on the genre Roger Ebert dubbed ""the Dead Teenager Movie"" wherein frustratingly dim adolescents defy even the most obvious survival instincts getting themselves eliminated in a series of creatively gory ways. Here rather than shouting ""Dont go up those stairs"" at the screen audiences may find themselves screaming ""Dont click that button"" as the characters make ill-informed decisions on their computers that lead to death by handgun knife and blender. Our vision is limited to whatever a character named Blaire (Shelley Hennig) sees on her Mac laptop. Theres a menu bar running across the top of the screen at all times as she shuffles back and forth between windows navigating between her browser her music library and an ongoing group video conference with the reduced attention span of an easily distracted teen. We see Blaire as her friends do via Skype in a crowded window where all six characters -- and an anonymous lurker -- split the screen. The experience begins with Blaire (Shelley Hennig) watching an online snuff film in which a disturbed young woman named Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman) takes out a handgun and shoots herself in the face. Blaire and her friends knew Laura who was one of the popular kids at their high school whereas they are the sort who were likely picked on by their peers -- an intriguing reversal of the usual adolescent power structure. Someone recorded Lauras gruesome suicide via cameraphone and uploaded to the Internet where ""the video that forced her to kill herself"" also went viral. Now on the one-year anniversary of Lauras death the girls spirit wants to know who is behind these leaks coming back to seek her (groan) ""cybernatural"" revenge online. (""Online"" was screenwriter Nelson Greaves negligibly better working title.) Greaves script combines this tepid mystery parsing out clues as to who was ""responsible"" for driving Laura to suicide with a succession of brutal killings as some unseen force manipulates the computer and forces Blaires friends to kill themselves while the others look on in horror. During the films most intense moments ""Cybernatural"" amplifies the effect of that infamous shot from ""The Blair Witch Project"" the one where Heather Donahue turns the camera on herself oozing snot and tears into the camera as she hyperventilates. Here the characters all lean in to their respective webcams and freak out over something only they seem to understand -- namely what kind of malevolent force theyre dealing with. Blaires best guess comes when she pulls up the Wikipedia entry for ""demonic possession"" which features the films single scariest visual (a jolting image that doesnt actually appear on Wikipedia) -- a bit of a cheat really since Blaire keeps refreshing the creepy page even though no one makes a convincing case for possession. Instead theyre plagued by little glitches where their computers appear to have a will of their own (windows popping open at random or buttons refusing to comply) while the video streams degenerate whenever something scary occurs onscreen so that its frustratingly difficult to make out whats supposed to be happening  -- all of which takes some nimble editing to sustain the unnerving effect that everything is unfolding in real time. For the record ""Cybernatural"" isnt the first film to take place entirely within a computer screen. Two Ryerson film school students Walter Woodman and Patrick Cederberg became the talk of Toronto last year with their clever short ""Noah"" and this years Fantasia program also includes ""Open Windows"" an ambitious Spanish chiller that features Elijah Wood at the mercy of a cybervillain. But the device still feels fresh for the moment at least though its sure to become as tired and overused as the original found-footage genre. Here it comes with the added frustration that audiences are stuck inside the heads of shallow social media-obsessed teens -- typo-prone numbskulls who take to Chatroulette when they should really be calling 911.

Anthony says April 26 2015 at 748 pm Quote ""typo-prone numbskulls who take to Chatroulette when they should really be calling 911."" ""Typo-prone"" in the sense that most people dispense with proper spelling grammar and capitalization when chatting on phone or messaging clients. Not particularly indicative of ones actual intelligence. ""Really should be calling 911"" -- they did twice. The first time it did no good the second time the voice on the other end was ALSO the killer. Thats why they never tried again and thats why they went into Chatroulette to ask a stranger to dial 911 for them.

When the movie ""Flight"" used Budweisser without the companys permission there was nothing Bud could do about it. So why do online entities get special treatment? Reply Sam says August 3 2014 at 239 am Open Windows and The Den got to the ""desktop horror"" first. Cybernatural does it better.

TWITTER Six loathsome bullies get whats coming to them. Taking aim at cyberbullies on their home turf Levan Gabriadzes Unfriended envisions an I Know What You Did Last Summer-style vengeance scenario conducted by a ghost entirely via social media. Presented as if it were being witnessed on one of the protagonists laptops the pic sticks with its gimmick more honestly than Nacho Vigalondos Open Windows a Fantasia entry with a similar visual conceit. Though its substantially less successful in dramatic than in technical terms the pic could draw some attention from genre diehards in niche bookings. The setting is a group Skype chat in which five high-school friends log on together for no reason other than to have company while wasting hours of their youths sitting alone in their bedrooms. Around the time they realize this is the anniversary of the suicide of Laura Burns a classmate they hated a mysterious sixth person enters the chat -- an anonymous digital intruder claiming to be Lauras spirit. Assuming this to be a creepy hacker they try and fail to hang up on ""him"" but this hacker has skills. Hes soon taunting them (and a sixth friend) across an array of platforms controlling texts video messages and the like. (The services are all depicted with their real brands -- YouTube Facebook Skype et cetera.) As they grow increasingly agitated he turns them against each other by revealing secrets he has no way of knowing -- betrayals insults and worse -- before proceeding to grisly physical punishments that apparently involve psychic control. These kids are more loathsome than the average victims of slasher-flick boogeymen and the young actors have little success (if theyre trying) in making them interesting despite their shallow nastiness; as the film begins knocking them off in the usual ways we cant even take pleasure in their deaths. By the gory final moments the picture finds ways to wrench the annoyance level higher with goofy onscreen animation and an inexplicable plea for help to the nonplussed denizens of Chatroulette. While much of the screen-hopping that precedes this has a messy believability -- with the lead bully flicking ADHD style between monitoring BitTorrent choosing Pandora tunes researching the paranormal on Wikipedia and using four or five different technologies to communicate with her frenemies -- in the end one would rather be back at ones own computer tending to the tedious details of digital life than watching this clique get pinged to death.
