Pics a throwback to Hollywoods seriocomedies about love and rivalry among disparate sisters. Three of Hollywoods most beautiful and gifted actresses Meg Ryan Diane Keaton and Lisa Kudrow are vastly underutilized in ""Hanging Up"" a shamelessly sappy family meller that bears the schmaltzy sensibility of Nora Ephron pics producer and co-scripter rather than that of Diane Keaton its director. Pics a throwback to Hollywoods seriocomedies about love and rivalry among disparate sisters here brought together when their old but still flamboyant dad is hospitalized. Except for its glorious A-list cast the film would fit snugly on the small screen in terms of its scope ambition and message. That cast -- which along with aforementioned thesps includes Walter Matthau in a substantial part and Cloris Leachman in a tiny one -- and Columbias aggressive marketing campaign almost guarantee a strong opening weekend though mixed-to-negative reviews and lukewarm word of mouth should result in moderate B.O. that will not fulfill expectations. In all of her films whether pics based on original scripts (""Sleepless in Seattle"") remakes of French farces (""Mixed Nuts"") derivative imitations of yesteryears chestnuts (""Youve Got Mail"") or Capraesque tributes (""Michael"") Ephron has basically made the same kind of harmless innocuous entertainment -- star-driven predictably soft and undemanding of its viewers. Its too bad that the talented and charming Ryan has become the quintessential Ephron heroine for as she has proven in other pictures her range is far wider than what shes asked to display in a typical Ephron confection. Pics poster and ad campaign which try to cash in on the far superior and wittier ""The First Wives Club"" (which also starred Keaton) are deceptive for they suggest that the trio of women play leading co-starring roles. In actuality Ryan is the sole protagonist Eve -- the middle sister whos still flooded with memories of being Daddys girl but now has matured into a responsible woman who unlike her self-absorbed siblings is committed to her fathers welfare. First act is irritatingly dominated by endless phone conversations among the sisters -- the cell phone is one of the few icons that gives this sentimental pic a contempo feel. As story begins Eve takes her irascible patriarchal father Lou (Matthau) to the hospital for a series of tests related to his confusion and disorientation. It turns out that Daddys real problem is his failure to acknowledge that his wife Pat (Leachman) has left him. Earlier under pressure from her father Eve visits her mom now residing in Big Bear. In whats one of the films feeblest scenes Leachman gets to deliver an embarrassingly ""feminist"" speech about how she was never meant to be a mother. Back home Eve enjoys a loving marriage with her infinitely patient husband Joe (Adam Arkin) and good rapport with her sensitive boy Jesse (Jesse James). A car accident in a parking lot caused by -- what else -- careless talk on her cell introduces Eve to Omar (Duke Moosekian) who later shows up as a doctor where Lou is hospitalized and to his Iranian mother Ogmed (Ann Bortolotti). In a tearful scene Ogmed delivers pics central message Sometimes its important to disconnect from parents. Eves sisters are narrowly defined and one-dimensional. Georgia (Keaton) the eldest and most elegant vies for a spot on the power list as editor in chief of her self-titled womens magazine. Youngest sis Maddy (Kudrow) the most spontaneous and least mature is a woman who solemnly declares one day that her lifes vocation is acting and five years later after a disappointing career as a soap actress just as solemnly announces that she is quitting acting. Whether consciously or not Maddys part recalls Dianne Wiests role in ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" also about three sisters during the holiday season. Story is framed by two flashbacks. In the first set in Christmas 1988 the sisters are shocked to find their father in bed with an old acquaintance though sequence changes tone when he confesses that hes unable to live without their mother. The second in Halloween 1993 relates a bad incident when Dads offensive conduct interrupts Jesses birthday party scaring the kids away and causing friction between Eve and her hubby who vows never again to let Lou in their house. Watching this mushy melodrama which contains occasional shards of humor (but no wit or subtlety) encourages viewers to remember its stars better vehicles. Ryan who could have played this role in her sleep gets to deliver some foul lines and four-letter words that recall her famous scene in the far superior ""When Harry Met Sally ..."" Matthau recycles elements of his roles in ""The Odd Couple"" and the ""Grumpy Old Men"" movies. Theatrical entrances by Keaton who still sports one of Hollywoods shapeliest pair of legs bring back fond memories of similar passages in ""Baby Boom"" and other comedies. In the least developed part Kudrow delivers one-liners in a manner that exhibits her delicious comic timing shown to much better advantage in ""The Opposite of Sex."" Keaton who made the equally schmaltzy but more deftly observed meller ""Unstrung Heroes"" is an efficient helmer here overseeing a glossy easy-to-digest entertaining package with good production values across the board particularly Bobbie Reads alluring costumes which display the stars at their most glamorous. Choices of music like productions other aspects are obvious The Christmas sequence is introduced with Judy Garlands emotional rendition of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" from ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" Keatons sequences as mag editor are punctuated by ""Georgia on My Mind"" and so on. ""Hanging Up"" celebrates forgiveness and family love concluding on a fake farcical note with a sisterly Thanksgiving reunion. Indeed commercial prospects for the picture which was originally skedded for Christmas 1999 release will further suffer from its push back to late winter.

Its too phony to be anything truly heartfelt so it exists in a limbo of pointlessness. Its what Hollywood comes up with when it contrives to imitate sincerity. The picture which opens today is written by Delia and Nora Ephron based on Delia Ephrons novel. Its about three sisters and their dying father but its also inadvertently about the lifestyles of the rich and famous. The father a former screenwriter for John Wayne is played by Walter Matthau. The older sister played by Diane Keaton (who also directed) edits and publishes her own womens magazine. The youngest sister (Lisa Kudrow) is a famous soap opera actress. That leaves Eve the middle sister played by Meg Ryan. Eve isnt famous but shes pretty well off. She talks on her cell phone while driving a huge sport utility vehicle and according to one bit keeps getting into car accidents. It takes a naive faith to make a sympathetic character out of a cell-phone wielding SUV-driving menace. Then again Ryan could make Imelda Marcos into a sympathetic character. Shed just have to wrinkle her nose and say ""I love shoooes"" As Eve Ryan lets us understand that she is a road menace because she is too busy taking care of her family. Her sisters dont want to be bothered so shes the one who has to check her disoriented father into the hospital and visit him every day. As Dad Matthau does what he has done for the past 10 years. He plays a grumpy old man who occasionally surprises people -- though at this point not the audience -- with lewd remarks and behavior. He talks about John Waynes private parts tries to fondle a nurse and describes a woman as ""a good lay."" This is supposed to be endearing. That its not endearing is a problem. The movie revolves around the intensity of the bond between Eve and her father but the script gives us little sense of who this man is and why we should like him. The father scenes should have been the heart of the picture. But theyre written as half-hearted gestures and are without impact. Living up to its title ""Hanging Up"" hits us with endless volleys of scenes showing Eve shouting into her cell phone. Keaton directs these scenes at a screwball pace which would seem to be the right strategy but it backfires. The bombardment becomes irritating a lot of sound and fury in the service of nothing. Ryan is a good emotional actress and she has the films best moments. In one scene Dad viciously insults Eve and though she fights back Ryan leaves the audience with no doubt that she is deeply hurt. Watching it one can almost feel her devastation physically. Ryan also builds a nice rapport with Kudrow and their sister relationship is believable. Keaton has less luck directing herself. She has never mugged more never until now shown us all the adorable-winning-smiling- laughing things that she can do. But considering the script she had to deal with her performance had to be the least of her worries. HANGING UP Comedy. Starring Meg Ryan Lisa Kudrow Diane Keaton and Walter Matthau.

Three working sisters (Keaton Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow) who communicate largely via telephone are forced to deal with the imminent death of their father (Walter Matthau). Dad a former Hollywood screenwriter (as was the father of Delia and Nora Ephron who based their script on Delias novel) is a monster who though losing his marbles can still fire off a mean one-liner. In flashback we see the damage this alcoholic selfish man has inflicted on his daughters. Ryan the perpetually flustered middle daughter is forced to deal with his hospitalization--shes the sister with ""heart"" as were repeatedly told. Keaton the family superstar is a self-involved careerist too busy running a magazine shes named after herself to deal with the mess. Kudrow the youngest is a ditsy soap-opera actress who cant get anyone to take her seriously.There are some raw uncomfortable emotions bubbling deep under the surface of ""Hanging Up"" but Keaton is loath to deal with them. Like people who compulsively giggle whenever they tell you bad news the movie runs for cover in lame comic shtik. Why are we watching cute-dog jokes? Why are the actors trying to out-cute the dog? And why does this L.A.-based movie look as if it had been shot through a thick London fog? More to the point why tell this story if youre afraid to tell it like it is? This is sugar-coating that melts in your hand not your heart.D.A.

These people will say its a heartwarming story about three cutely neurotic sisters who work through old rivalries and free themselves from an unhealthy addiction to cell phones while coping with a demanding deteriorating old father ultimately demonstrating powerful sisterhood by playfully dumping baking flour on each others pretty haircuts. These people will call me cold when I point out that there is not one honest moment not one in Hanging Up A smug self-serving charmless exercise in niche-marketed sentiment it seemingly congratulates baby boomers for dealing maturely with their aging parents (as opposed to what leaving them in Dumpsters?). But actually Hanging Up congratulates only novelist Delia Ephron and her older sister and co-screenwriter Nora Ephron on exploiting their own family dynamics for personal gain. And while there is nothing shameful about being moved by an indefensible movie Hanging Up represents everything so very duplicitous and psychotherapeutically bogus that we as an audience must resist at all costs if we are not to be anesthetized by bunkum. The three siblings lazily delineated by well-known actresses doing familiar impersonations are pop-cultural cliches. Diane Keaton (who also directed) as the oldest is the tightly wound overachiever whose superficiality and self-involvement are implied because shes a top magazine editor and shes single. Lisa Kudrow as the youngest is the flaky underachiever whose superficiality and self-involvement are implied since shes a soap-opera actress and traipses from man to man. And Meg Ryan as the undervalued middle child -- subtly named Eve after the mother of us all -- is the self-appointed heroine an allegedly adorable superwoman who has a husband a son and a job as a party planner satisfying other obnoxious women. Women are never treated with more disdain than in Ephron productions. Indeed even likable females are diminished. Because life isnt fair Eve bears the weight of ministering to her alternatingly entertaining and tedious alcoholic daddy (Walter Matthau). But because Hanging Up is even less fair than life Eve accepts comfort in the nursing home cafeteria from a loving Persian matron whose only purpose is to toast the saintliness of such a good blond daughter ""To your bravery and to your grief"" she murmurs. To ours too for hanging on through Hanging Up.
