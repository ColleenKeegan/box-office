Photo Ryan Bingham the suave road warrior so brilliantly played by George Clooney in Jason Reitmans razor-sharp crowd-pleasing and Oscar-friendly comedy ""Up in the Air"" thinks he has it all figured out. Never check luggage and always stand behind Asians in the airport security line he advises as he spends hundreds of days a year crisscrossing America to coldly downsize ever-increasing numbers of workers on behalf of their employers. PHOTOS DECEMBERS BEST OSCAR BETS What Ryan hasnt figured out is that he needs what he comes to call a ""co-pilot"" for his rudderless existence typified by his obsession to collect 10 million frequent-flier miles from American Airlines. And not because he actually wants to use them to go anywhere. A deeply confirmed middle-aged bachelor Ryan finally glimpses an alternative lifestyle when he meets up with his comely opposite number Alex (Vera Farmiga) who appears to be even more averse to commitment than he is. In one of the great meet-cutes in Hollywood history they compare cards from customer loyalty programs debate their merits and post-coitus sit laptop to laptop trying to schedule another tryst into their transcontinental lifestyles. ""Think of me as yourself -- only with a vagina"" Alex coos. Its an offer even Ryan cant refuse until he is grounded by his sleazy boss (Jason Bateman) back at the home office in Omaha -- where our hero spent a ""miserable 43 days"" last year in an apartment that closely resembles a hotel room. The Boss thinks the company can squeeze even more money out of the countrys rising tide of economic misery by dismissing employees by video over the Internet. This horrifies Ryan and not just because hell be losing all those miles. Even for someone who coolly lies to people that being fired is an ""opportunity"" this seems too callous. Ryan protests to The Boss that Natalie the young efficiency expert who has developed the video-firing system has no experience in actually handling dismissals. So The Boss orders our hero to take the naive Natalie (Anna Kendrick funny and touching) out on the road for a real-world education that turns out to be rather brutal. The downsizing scenes have a real bite because -- aside from J.K. Simmons and Zach Galifianakis -- Reitman has recruited real-life workers from Detroit and St. Louis who have been encouraged to draw on their own firings. Between these mini-dramas and a rather desperately bacchanalian trade show crashed by Ryan Alex and Natalie ""Up in the Air"" offers perhaps the most devastating portrait of corporate American since ""The Apartment"" won the Best Picture Oscar half a century ago. The pitch-perfect direction by Jason Reitman (""Juno"") perfectly balances comedy and drama even teasing us with the prospect of a romantic comedy ending when the increasingly smitten Ryan -- who realizes for the first time in his life that hes lonely -- invites Alex as his date to the wedding of a sister (Melanie Lynskey) he barely knows. Clooney reaches deeply into himself for this role with thoroughly winning results -- especially in a terrific scene where the marriage-phobic Ryan is forced to calm the anxieties of a bridegroom (Danny McBride) with cold feet. He is perfectly partnered by the sexy Farmiga who is a much more accomplished actress than you might suspect from her best-known role a thankless turn as Matt Damons shrink/girlfriend in ""The Departed."" ""Up in the Air"" based on a novel by Walter Kirn is one of the years best films and so tapped into the zeitgeist that its positively scary. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next ABC nixes 2 more Adam Lambert performances Read Next ABC nixes 2 more Adam Lambert performances Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44899 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 26238 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 15793 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Ryan Bingham thrives in the betwixt-and-between spaces. To know him is to fly with him he says in the early moments of Jason Reitmans gift of a comedy ""Up in the Air."" More than a little detached Ryan could easily have been disagreeable. Instead his decency is polished to a luster by George Clooney. Ryan is the stars richest character since Michael Clayton the legal fixer in the movie of the same name. Bingham is also a corporate fixer of sorts. He flies into towns where companies are laying off employees. His job is to help them with the heave-ho. When not sitting across the table from the downsized in Tulsa or Wichita or Detroit he makes the rounds on the motivational speaker circuit. Hes an up-and-coming guru of nonattachment preaching the virtues of the unencumbered life. He lives by his credo. The apartment he returns to in Omaha makes the hotel rooms he checks into look like comfy nests. Production designer Steve Saklad has delivered the goods when it comes to showing the purgatories Ryan feels at home in. ""Up in the Air"" had a sneak preview at the Telluride Film Festival and folks wondered if the movie might have a hard time finding an audience. Its themes of economic downturn were just too glum too close to the bone. Yet it is precisely Reitmans whole- hearted smart-minded depiction of the sorrow of workers the pitilessness of employers and the seductive arguments against forming bonds -- familial and romantic -- that make the film so current and enduring. Like the people Ryan coaches into unemployment his life is about to change dramatically. His boss (played by Jason Bateman) decides to ground Ryan because Natalie a whipper-snapper of efficiency has an idea. Fire by telecommuting. Before becoming desk-bound however Ryan has to take Natalie (Anna Kendrick) out on the road to see what happens really when you tell an employee theyre being ""let go."" Its the sort of twist that could easily have led to familiar romantic comedy ploys. But Reitman (who co-wrote the screenplay with Sheldon Turner) is more savvy. At the very moment when Ryan is arguing for staying in the air he meets Alex played with wry certainty by Vera Farmiga. A fellow frequent traveler she calls him and raises him. Reitman says he wrote the role of Natalie with Kendrick in mind. He saw her verbally skewer the competition in the indie comedy ""Rocket Science."" Shes just as deft with dialogue here but does break out work with emotion. This is Reitmans third feature. His debut ""Thank You for Smoking"" was followed by sophomore hit ""Juno."" Each has improved upon the other. From taxi to touchdown Reitman knows how to get us to the next destination. Even the credit sequence impresses with crystalline images of U.S. cities shot from a near perfect-height -- the one where the plane hasnt yet reached cruising altitude in which the towns below looks like a circuit board or a mosaic or a jigsaw puzzle. The music is by Rolfe Kent. His choices are atmospheric moody. But he doesnt get out ahead of the action. Dana Glaubermans quicksilver editing is top-flight. J.K. Simmons and Zach Galifianakis play characters on the receiving end of Ryans practiced riffs. This years Starz Denver Film Festival Cassavetes Award recipient Simmons shares in one of the films best moments. Still it is a string of unknowns reacting to the corporate kiss-off that grounds ""Up in the Air"" in the most profound sense of the word. Reitman and company auditioned real folk in the economically hard-hit cities of Detroit and St. Louis. Their reactions bring a pained and truthful dignity to this gem. They remind us of the tragedy in the comedy. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com. Also on blogs.denverpostcom/madmoviegoer ""UP IN THE AIR.""

Media San Francisco Chronicle Up in the Air Comedy. Starring George Clooney. Directed by Jason Reitman. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Up in the Air"" concerns a blithe loner who lives in the skies always traveling never grounded for long. With no wife and no baggage beyond a black wheeled carry-on he spends most of his time in the clouds. Any film that tells his story would have to be light on its feet but the deftness and surety of Jason Reitmans latest work defy the law of gravity. Crisply funny and fleetly paced its in its quiet way one of the saddest things in the theaters all year. The sadness accrues bit by bit beginning with an absolute downer of a subject - a corporate terminator-for-hire who wings around the country firing people - and ending as it must in an airport. But despite a premise that augers loneliness and heartbreak the film teases us into believing that something rosy might be waiting on arrival. As the plane sinks lower things look up. Caught within this paradox and wearing it like a fine Italian suit is George Clooney as Ryan Bingham dashing downsizer par excellence. The part requires an actor of enormous superficial charm; we have to like him enough not to want to kick him in the shins even while hes jetting around the country dispensing pink slips. But it also requires a dark smear of melancholy something heavy around the shoulders and worried around the eyes. Glib as he is Ryan cant quite believe his own blarney. And thats pure Clooney.

George Clooney in ""Up in the Air."" Photo Paramount Review Up in the Air 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Its also pure Reitman whose ""Thank You for Smoking"" starred Aaron Eckhart as a tobacco lobbyist forced to clarify (if not renounce) his own heartless values. Emotionally ""Up in the Air"" lands somewhere between ""Smoking"" and the idiosyncratic heartfelt ""Juno"" another look at characters keeping tabs on their priorities. Once again Reitman the screenwriter gives Reitman the director an excuse to ponder the spaces between us and the ties that bind. Or dont. Based on the novel by Walter Kirn the film also stars two female foils Alex (Vera Farmiga) a sex-bomb fellow traveler in satin shirts and Natalie (Anna Kendrick) a know-it-all neophyte tagging along while Ryan sacks people. Farmiga has all the flirty scenes and dirty repartee but its Kendrick who really gets in Clooneys face. Moviegoers who know her only as the ""Twilight"" sagas annoying Jessica will be amazed to find her holding forth on the evils of solitude or cracking to pieces (suddenly hilariously) over a text message. Scattered throughout are plain-talking close-ups of folks being laid off most of them played by non-actors dramatizing the moment - in real life - when they actually got canned. For them the title doesnt suggest a preference for air travel or some existential lightness of being unbearable or otherwise. It means rootlessness and unpredictability in tough economic times. Reitmans film is a testament to them on their journey - and a portrait of Ryan on his. It soars. Up in the Air Comedy. Starring George Clooney. Directed by Jason Reitman. (R. 109 minutes.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 03 2009 141PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Up in the Air Directed by Jason Reitman Written by Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner Starring George Clooney Vera Farmiga Anna Kendrick Classification 14A It looks like a romantic comedy. It jokes like a romantic comedy. Its got the charm and the quick banter and the amorous epiphany of a romantic comedy. But just when were settled into a comfortable groove gainfully employed in the audiences usual job of having its expectations satisfied the movie boots us out of our complacency. Summoned to its office we and our smug assumptions are cut loose sent packing and left ... yes up in the air free-falling in a world much darker than we imagined. No wonder the opening scene is a montage of people getting fired. The climate is definitely recessionary but the economys bust is Ryan Binghams boom. Thats because he works for the company that companies hire when theyre laying off staff and cant face the slaughter themselves. A consummate pro Ryan is a hatchet-man who keeps his axe as sharp as his intelligence. The blade is awfully bloody these days yet few would claim it isnt deftly swung - his victims are severed with an efficient dispatch that leaves no legal mess and scant time for tears. In Ryans skilled hands heads roll neatly down the elevator and out of the building entire careers gone in mere minutes with nothing to mark their absence save a stacked pile of security passes - the notches in every corporations tightened belt. Directed by Jason Reitman Up in the Air stars George Clooney Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick. So we hate the guy right? Not when hes played by George Clooney with his roguish charm and deft wit cranked up to full high beams. Turns out getting canned by Clooney is a joy to behold. Better yet his character is at peace and of a piece with his job. What he does to others hes also done to himself - severed any meaningful ties with those around him with his family and community. A travelling executioner Ryans home is on a plane and in a hotel room which is exactly where he likes it - packing light moving fast racking up air miles and flying over all the domestic conventions that ground his fellow mortals. Clearly with his on-screen buoyancy not to mention his off-screen rep Clooney is made for this role. So is Vera Farmiga as Alex a fetching blonde who shares Ryans peripatetic habits and no-strings credo. Meeting in a Hilton lounge the two pack in a night of sex just as they do their carry-on luggage - with brisk enjoyment taking pride in the arrangement of things. The morning after flight schedules are compared and future meetings mapped out. Life is good fast fun. So at this point is the flick. Enter the complication when Ryans boss brings in the aptly named Natalie Keener (a wonderfully prim Anna Kendrick). Shes a hot-shot fresh out of grad school and armed with a cost-saving scheme to eliminate travel expenses by confining the henchmen to the Omaha headquarters then having them do their dirty work via ""video conferencing."" Naturally our wayfarer is having none of that. Inviting little Miss Keener on the road he teaches her a thing or two about the real world of summary executions. And no doubt he learns a valuable lesson himself the kind thats sure to put the enduring romance into the flighty comedy. Or so we think. But director Jason Reitman has other more interesting ideas. As he proved in Juno and Thank You for Smoking  Reitman possesses a flair for off-kilter scenarios and hes in fine form again taking his triangulated principals - Ryan Alex Keener - out of their comfort zones and into a more complicated geometry. This is where the complacent audience gets the sack turfed out of its own comfort zone. As in all comedies theres a wedding but here its really just a sideshow. As in all romances theres a heartfelt realization but this time its not much of a heart. As for the implicit tragedy amidst the funny business the swelling ranks of the unemployed the movie has no solution but instead offers itself as implicit solace Escape ye wretches into my clever humour and my nifty dialogue and my stars considerable charm. Maybe thats a cop out - occasionally the picture can seem too buoyant too much at frothy odds with its underlying content. Or perhaps like Ryan its just doing its job unburdened by hypocrisy. So if the unexpected ending leaves us as hung out to dry as the recently terminated at least weve been thoroughly amused en route. After all in an age of change and uncertainty when everything is up in the air Up in the Air delivers a down-to-earth message ""Were here to make limbo bearable."" Grin then and gratefully bear it.

They understood that real laughter comes from a place of great sadness and their flawed heroes kept on fighting in the face of a ridiculous world. Movie Information Up In the AirRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Jason ReitmanActorsGeorge Clooney Vera Fermiga Anna Kendrick and Jason BatemanRun time 109 minutesMPAA rating R (language sexual content)SynopsisA tenderly caustic comedy about the art and risk of cutting yourself off from meaningful relationships.More movies from GuideLive.comYou get the feeling Wilder would appreciate the caustic tenderness of Up in the Air. This is a movie for our times The lead character travels from city to city to fire people for a living collecting as many frequent-flier miles as he can along the way. But in the hands of director Jason Reitman who adapted the script from Walter Kirns 2001 novel its also a thoroughly modern and jagged take on the classic screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s. It has an old soul. In other words its a comedy for grownups the cultural equivalent of a Big Gulp in the desert.Like a screwball hero George Clooneys Ryan Bingham has a pair of women in his life. Alex (the effortlessly sexy Vera Farmiga) is a fellow elite-status traveler who has perfected the art of suitcase living. Natalie (Anna Kendrick late of Twilight New Moon) is a brisk young go-getter with a bright idea for streamlining the whole firing process Do it all by Skype cut that travel budget down to size and make a brutally personal task as impersonal as looking at a computer screen. But Natalie lacks Ryans soft touch so their boss (Jason Bateman in high smarm mode) sends teacher and pupil on the road for a lesson in how to chop heads with a smile.At its core Up in the Air is a finely chiseled character study with a deceptively big heart. Ryan is a committed bachelor. When hes not serving up platitudes to the newly unemployed he gives motivational speeches on how to make your backpack smaller - corporate-speak for ridding your life of meaningful relationships. Clooney trades on his Everyman charisma and gives the character a deeply ingrained glibness; Ryan prides himself on never letting anyone in on keeping the world at bay. This approach allows him to thrive as a professional hatchet man; for him its just one piece of business.Up in the Air like the best films of Alexander Payne (including Sideways) shows what happens when a modern man is forced to become a human being. It also shows how to make an emotionally resonant film without dipping into easy sentiments about life lessons.Ive heard people say the movie is too depressing to be funny and its easy to see why. Reitman makes comedies that dont like to be categorized. Like his first two films (Thank You for Smoking and Juno) Up in the Air wrestles with demons even as it laughs at them. And just when you think it might seek a conventional way out it reminds you of its roots in the real world where no one is transformed overnight and the gears just keep clicking away.Few recent films have been so adroit at looking outward while burrowing inward. Up in the Air is entertainment first and foremost; it is fundamentally romantic and the script crackles with the excitement of smart people sizing each other up. But it also has time for people and circumstances that cant glide through life so blithely.When we see the reactions of Ryan and Natalies victims the loyal workers who have to go home and tell loved ones the jig is up were reminded why some tasks require a facade of indifference. Then we watch as Reitman slowly strips that facade away. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Comments (24) click to enlarge Up in the Air 2009 Jason Reitmans smart and polished rom-com about a white-collar hatchet man (George Clooney) has been marinating in Oscar buzz since it premiered at the Toronto film festival; its the sort of grandly entertaining mildly challenging moral drama that people in the industry like to see rewarded. As a consultant for downsizing companies Clooneys character spends ten months a year flying around the country enjoying the good life of swank hotels and rental cars as he works his way down numbered lists telling people theyve been canned. The movie opens with a montage of his unlucky targets reacting to the news and theyre heartbreaking but for some reason were expected to identify with Clooney playing another of his cool-cat bachelors and pity him when he finally figures out hes a loser. Reitman deserves credit for going through with a bitterly ironic ending but the movie is marred by its warm condescension toward flyover country. With Vera Farmiga Anna Kendrick and Jason Bateman.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 4 2009 Save for later Saved George Clooney portrays Ryan Bingham in a scene from ""Up in the Air."" Dale Robinette/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In ""Up in the Air"" George Clooneys Ryan Bingham is a ""career transition consultant"" i.e. a guy who travels around the country doing the dirty work of corporate bosses too cowardly to fire their own employees. The movies title is an apt description of Ryans existential condition and his literal one too since he spends on average 322 days a year on the job often on planes. His proudest achievement in life is that he is nearing 10-million-mile frequent-flyer status.Ryan is an antihero for these parlous times and of course since hes played by Clooney we wait for him to redeem himself and become a full-fledged hero. But its to the credit of director Jason Reitman - who co-wrote the screenplay with Sheldon Turner based on the 2001 Walter Kirn novel - that the movie for the most part scrupulously avoids sentimentality.Reportedly Reitman began working on this material four years ago when the economy was good and Ryans situation could be played for laughs. Not any longer. There are numerous sequences in ""Up in the Air"" where Ryan meets face to face with total strangers and in his purring ""concerned"" corporatespeak drops the bomb. And then we see the instantaneous reactions he elicits the horror and panic and misery and rage. Many of these workers were culled by Reitman from the ranks of actual laid-off workers and their testimony intermittently brings the film a lot closer to say a Fred Wiseman documentary like ""Welfare"" than to a comedy from the guy who gave us ""Juno"" and ""Thank You for Smoking."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? I have some ethical qualms about using the real-life upsets of real-life people to give what is essentially a classy entertainment its dollop of gravitas. But I think to do anything less would have been far more objectionable. Reitman doesnt linger over the miseries; theres nothing leery or masochistic about the way he handles them. This is a movie about among other things pain and its made by someone who understands its expression. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Up in the Air movie review Ryan finds his sky-high counterpart in Vera Farmigas Alex a corporate traveler he meets on the hustings who matches him gold card for gold card. They seduce each other by running down their members-only status. Its a great joke - bonus miles as the ultimate erotic enticement. Plus it helps that they both look spectacular even after spending many rumply hours in transit. I havent seen chemistry this good between two movie actors in ages. Clooney in his movies is so charismatic that he can often score even when his female costar isnt up to his game but when hes paired with someone who can match him (as was also the case with surprisingly Jennifer Lopez in ""Out of Sight"") hes doubly glamorous. Farmiga has a been-around quality here that so sensual its almost comic. At times shes reminiscent of Lauren Bacall who also knew how to slink with the best of them and still stay smart. And of course Clooney the most Golden Age of Hollywood-looking of all contemporary actors has sometimes been compared to Bogart who specialized in hard-boiled romantics.Ryan occasionally gives motivational speeches to executives in which he talks about fitting all thats important in ones life into a single backpack. This is not difficult for him He flies with a single carry-on bag and on those rare occasions when hes not traveling he holes up in his furniture-challenged Omaha apartment. (Its a crash pad really.) Ryan doesnt go in for much emotional baggage either which is why when he warms to Alex and their serial dalliances he seems more befuddled than blissful.Hes jolted to earth by the introduction of a new whiz-kid employee Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who has been hired by Ryans boss (Jason Bateman) to cut costs by firing people via videoconferencing. Ryan rails at the inhumanity of this tactic but uppermost in his mind is the potential loss of all those future frequent-flyer miles. He is ordered to take Natalie on the road in order to give her firsthand experience but what he really wants to do is scare her.Natalie is such an abrasive drip that we wait for the moment when she gets whats coming to her. Compared to Ryan and Alex Natalie is a bit too caricatured too much the embodiment of comic relief for this bittersweet film. And yet it needs her. Without her we might not see the shadings in Ryans emotional makeup. In his own deadpan way he cares about her especially when she reveals chinks in her robot armor. In his eyes shes salvageable.Reitman like Ryan holds back a bit. Hes made a movie about a guy on his flight to self-discovery but the self to be discovered perhaps by necessity never quite coalesces. Clooney is so adept at portraying a man who avoids human connection that when the togetherness kicks in - especially near the end when Ryan is recruited to straighten out his estranged sisters wedding - it feels not false exactly but a little flip. Ryan is a more resonant a more mysterious character than this movie for all its charms and intelligence can safely handle. But his evasions and yearnings set against the backdrop of recessionary rage is nevertheless stronger stuff than just about anything else on the screens right now.

ABOUT THE MOVIEUp in the Air    (out of four)Stars George Clooney Anna Kendrick Vera Farmiga Jason Bateman J.K. Simmons Melanie LynskeyDirector Jason ReitmanDistributor Paramount PicturesRating R for language and some sexual contentRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Timeliness can be tricky to pull off convincingly in movies. Its tough to capture an era while its still happening yet Up in the Air does so brilliantly with wit and humanity. Artfully blending a breezy blithe spirit with a darker social satire Up in the Air has one of the years sharpest scripts and an exceptional ensemble cast. George Clooney plays slick corporate downsizer Ryan Bingham. Hes a smooth operator specializing in swift layoffs. Ryan travels to offices he has never set foot in and affably fires people hell never see again. Hes dubbed a ""career transition counselor"" not unlike the way garbage collectors are called ""sanitation engineers."" As a frequent-flying hired gun he pulls the trigger with frightening ease. Adept at serving up platitudes and blandly hopeful comfort Ryan doesnt particularly like his job but hes good at it. Mostly he enjoys being airborne. Hes in his element amid the anonymity of business class enjoying the perks of his position reveling in rootlessness. His lifes goal is to earn 10 million free miles though he has no exotic vacation destination in mind. Being one of the few to reach that milestone is reward enough for this vapid charmer. VIDEO Watch the trailer AIRPORT STRATEGY Surviving security with director Jason Reitman Co-writer and director Jason Reitman is a bona fide filmmaking talent. His Thank You for Smoking (2005) was a farcical delight and Juno (2007) an endearingly quirky comedy. With Up in the Air Reitman emerges as a modern-day Frank Capra capturing the nations anxieties and culture of resilience. Reitman improves upon Walter Kirns clever novel deftly portraying unemployment with humor and sensitivity. He skillfully juxtaposes Ryans casual arrogance with the care-worn faces and heartfelt reactions of real people not actors who have actually been laid off. Clooney gives one of his best performances upgrading Kirns smug anti-hero to a better class of fellow with an undercurrent of vulnerability. Reitman added layers to the characters made changes to the plot updated the setting and added players. Ryans comfortably nomadic existence is upset when his smarmy boss Craig (Jason Bateman) hires the freshly minted Natalie (Anna Kendrick) and institutes her plan to ""revolutionize"" the business by terminating employees via the Internet. A one-night stand with fellow traveler Alex (Vera Farmiga) begins to take on emotional heft for Ryan but things dont go as the story leads us to expect. In fact that is one of Up in the Airs most notable assets It doesnt travel straight from Point A to B. Reitman elevates the trajectory of the contemporary comedy setting it on a soaring flight pattern.

(Paramount Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday December 3 2009 615 PM Title Up in the Air Its possible that ""Up in the Air"" a comedy about the soul-deadening challenges of our disconnected era could only have been made by Jason Reitman. After all he turned teen pregnancy into amusing family fare (""Juno"") and rendered tobacco lobbyists likable (""Thank You for Smoking""). So perhaps its no surprise that hes come out with a lovely Hollywood romance that floats buoyantly along on a sea of sadness. George Clooney is perfectly attuned to Reitmans tack adding just a hint of a bruise to his slickly confident executive Ryan Bingham. Ryans job is to relieve others of theirs and he flies around the country firing anonymous employees so their cowardly bosses wont have to do it instead. But his own employment is threatened when his CEO (Jason Bateman) hires young go-getter Natalie (Anna Kendrick). She suggests Ryans job could be done via video conferencing which would ground him for good.For Ryan life on the road is the ideal existence. He gets first-class treatment everywhere and never has to deal with the inconveniences of commitment. But as he faces increasing challenges to his solitary routine including a relationship with another high flyer (Vera Farmiga) hes forced to wonder if its finally time to put down roots.Though the movie is based on Walter Kirns 2001 novel Reitman trades Kirns caustic madness for a wry melancholy that better suits the screen. This version also incorporates our recessionary anxieties but offers such a smooth ride we barely notice the turbulence until were back on the ground. A few scenes are overly broad or abrupt and Kendrick works a bit too hard to compose her character. But Reitman handles the majority of elements--from big themes to tiny details--with a skillful blend of empathy and wit. As for Clooney an unexpected vulnerability deepens his natural charisma while Farmiga turns out to be his onscreen soulmate. They create a connection that looks familiar but is miles away from the rom-com relationships weve been trained to accept. It feels real and in this prefab world thats a rare commodity indeed.

Its exactly the kind of film the big studios dont want to make anymore a mid-budget (25 million) hard-to-classify (serious comedy? funny drama?) movie about grown-ups made for grown-ups. ""They have no faith in these kinds of movies usually"" Reitman says. They dont usually have much faith in 32-year-old guys who dress like skater dudes (woolen cap jeans T shirt) and have directed all of two movies either. But Reitman kind of specializes in breaking the rules probably because hes been studying Hollywood his whole life. (Article continued below...)Reitman is the son of Ivan Reitman whose string of hit comedies helped define 80s Hollywood (Meatballs Stripes Ghostbusters) and his dads job provided a rare perch from which to study the business. Hes seen what happens when a young director is so hungry that he leaps at almost any project only to get pigeonholed. He actually turned down the first big directing job he was offered--Dude Wheres My Car?--twice. Looking back Reitman knows that sometimes in Hollywood you get only one shot but he had extra motivation to prove himself. He was determined to show ""that Im the real deal not just the son of the guy who made Ghostbusters"" he says. ""Ive always had an underdog perspective."" He says hes asked his father for help only one time when he wanted to buy the rights to Walter Kirns 2001 book Up in the Air.Reitman was browsing in a West Hollywood bookstore when he first encountered the novel about a man who flies around the country doing the dirty work the corporations dont want to touch he fires people for a living. Happily single blissfully unattached to any home or family Ryan Bingham spends his life in the air in airports in interchangeable hotel rooms dreaming of the perk-filled moment when hell achieve 10 million miles on his frequent-flier plan. (Kirns novel had the misfortune of coming out just after 9/11.) Reitman who shared Binghams obsession with solitude and travel started to write a satire about corporate life. He had to stop when he suddenly got the money to make his first film Thank You for Smoking. Several years later he resumed only to be interrupted again when he got the chance to direct Juno. By the time he revisited Up in the Air the economy had collapsed and unemployment was no longer a subject to be treated lightly. ""The world had changed"" Reitman says and he had changed too. ""Id gone from being a guy with a girlfriend living in a small apartment directing commercials to a man with a house a mortgage a wife and children. Id become a man in those years."" Suddenly everything hed written thus far seemed unsatisfactory ""It was from the point of view of someone with no responsibilities. I was just being satirical contradictory making fun of things."" So he set his aim higher wanting to make a film with the kind of complex seriocomic humanity he admired in Billy Wilder Hal Ashby James L. Brooks and the contemporary director he most reveres Alexander Payne (Sideways About Schmidt Election). ""Alexander is doing exactly what I want to do"" he says. ""He has the most honest take on human experience."" Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week There hasnt been a studio movie as unapologetically adult sophisticated and nuanced as Up in the Air in some time. Reitman wrote the lead with George Clooney in mind and there are echoes of the unmarried Clooneys life here. Hes playing another urbane charmer but theres a panic a vulnerability under the slick surface that Clooney has rarely shown. The rootless no-strings life Bingham has constructed is imperiled when a young efficiency expert (Anna Kendrick) hired by Binghams boss (Jason Bateman) concludes that the company can save time money and manpower by firing people remotely--via teleconferencing. Threatened with permanent grounding Bingham takes the brash woman on the road to show her why the delicate but brutal job must be done in person. Theres a second challenge to his beloved autonomy Alex (Vera Farmiga) another corporate frequent flier with whom he begins a hot affair. Alex is his perfect counterpart (""Think of me as you with a vagina"" she quips) as wary of emotional baggage as he is content with occasional romps in airport hotels when they can coordinate their flight patterns. Farmiga is a great partner for Clooney her wry sophistication setting off silky sexual sparks against his jaunty seductiveness. But Alex gets further under Binghams skin than he expects. Suddenly he experiences need and its profoundly uncomfortable.In its funny rueful way Up in the Air touches contemporary American notes few Hollywood movies acknowledge. It starts with a striking series of interviews with people who have lost their jobs (most of them are real people Reitman filmed under the guise of making a documentary about how people react to getting terminated) which immediately places us in the wintry present tense of the countrys economic climate. That this glimpse of cold reality meshes seamlessly with the romantic and comedic elements of the story is a testament to Reitmans growing assurance as a filmmaker. There are no heroes and villains in Up in the Air Kendricks smug efficiency expert turns out to have as many human surprises up her snappy pantsuits as the coolly self-sufficient Alex does; theres not a character who isnt granted his or her humanity. Up in the Air isnt your typical Oscar-bait movie theres nothing self-important or self-consciously flashy about it. More than likely it will compete against a murderers row of big hitters Peter Jacksons The Lovely Bones; Clint Eastwoods Nelson Mandela/rugby epic Invictus; Rob Marshalls Nine from the Fellini-inspired Broadway musical; and James Camerons nearly 500 million 3-D science-fiction adventure Avatar.This year the Academy expanded the field of best-picture nominees to 10 in the hope that the longer list would include more mainstream populist offerings and thus broaden the telecasts declining audience. Hollywood would be seriously embarrassed if the result instead is a lineup stacked with more small independent movies and foreign fare--especially in a year in which many of the studios such as Warner Bros. and Paramount shut down their independent boutiques and other distributors went out of business. It could well happen in the first 10 months of the year the movies most often cited as contenders such as The Hurt Locker Precious and An Education have all been independent productions. Only Pixars universally adored Up and long-shot studio hits such as District 9 Star Trek and Julie amp; Julia even enter the conversation. As Hollywood becomes more committed to movies based on videogames comic books and the hormonal fantasies of 16-year-old boys the trend toward independent Oscar dominance will continue--if the indies can find people to bankroll their increasingly endangered efforts.Reitmans movie has hit the sweet spot its an audience-friendly studio movie yet it harbors an independent spirit and heart. If it gets Reitman his second best-director nomination its not because he set out to get one though he thinks he could handle the heights. Hes seen directors paralyzed by success after winning an Oscar not that he worries about that either. ""Im not going to have a perfect career"" he says. ""Its better to be Billy Wilder and make lots of movies and have five or six great ones than to make so few movies that when you make a bad one it crushes you."" Up in the Air is likely to be remembered as one of his best.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Movie review George Clooney stars in Up in the Air washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Up in the Air Movie review George Clooney stars in Up in the Air In ""Up in the Air"" George Clooney and Vera Farmiga portray corporate frequent flyers. (Dale Robinette) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 4 2009 George Clooney has been pretty busy lately between ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" and the animated feature ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" Both of those are enjoyable enough larks but ""Up in the Air"" finds Clooney in a role he seems to have been born for. There are fewer things more sublime than Clooney in his comfort zone -- think ""Michael Clayton"" -- and when it happens the best advice is to sit back relax and enjoy the flight. In this case literally In ""Up in the Air"" Clooney plays Ryan Bingham a corporate downsizer who spends most of his life in airplanes and likes it that way. When hes not busy firing people hes giving inspirational lectures in which he strews such pearls of wisdom as ""Moving is living"" and ""Were not swans were sharks."" Director Jason Reitman (""Thank You for Smoking"" ""Juno"") has adapted Walter Kirns novel basically by throwing it out keeping Binghams character and inventing two more a sexy fellow road warrior named Alex (Vera Farmiga) and a young whippersnapper named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) whose ideas about teleconferencing may do unto Ryan what hes been doing unto others all these years. ""Up in the Air"" is a smart alert supremely entertaining movie in which Reitman toggles between comedy and drama satire and soul with the aplomb of hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger. For the most part the film is a swiftly moving picaresque through corporate offices and hotel lobbies but then Reitman slows things down for a lovely sequence set at a Midwestern wedding. Perhaps his best move -- as if perfect casting brilliant writing and flawless tonal control werent enough -- was beginning and ending the movie with interviews with the recently downsized most of them real-life. These sequences give what could have been a pleasurable enough bagatelle a thoroughly unexpected air of gravitas and pathos. ""Up in the Air"" is a timeless movie thats utterly of its time -- a movie of humor heart and mind.  R. At AMC Loews Georgetown. Contains profanity and some sexual content. 109 minutes.

Though we never really get to know the main character and the focus of the film is largely diluted the whole thing still comes off as refreshing and innovative. Thats the trick of social relevance and director Jason Reitman has pulled it off. George Clooney plays a consultant charged with traveling the country to lay people off. Hes the bearer of severance packages the seller of your ""new"" (though involuntary) life. Clooney portrays himself as a comforting assassin you walk in a room hes there he lets you down easy. Its all very saccharine and sterile this pushing you off a cliff. Clooney himself flies many hundreds of thousands of miles per year and he delights in the frequent flyer/preferred guest bubble hes created for himself. He hates home he loves to be on the move. Miami Tulsa Kansas City Milwaukee wherever there are folk to be fired youll find Clooney. And hes excellent at his job; experience has given him a sheen of ""Though weve just met I care deeply about your plight"" that he uses on every single soul. There are some great three-minute moments from those about to be let go; Zach Galifianakis and JK Simmons give lovely though short performances. This is Jason Reitmans first film since Juno and its easy to see why actors and audiences are attracted to his visual eye. The two films are extremely disparate one about a teen pregnancy the other about Clooneys axeman but Reitmans hands-off worldview shines through. He brings realistic portrayals of people to life though of course this version is missing Diablo Codys signature twang forgoing quirk for simpler (though just as authentic) moments. Anna Kendrick and Vera Farmiga do the rest of the heavy lifting in Up in the Air. Kendrick is a hard-charging strategist within Clooneys company -- her big idea is to fire people over the Internet no traveling required Vera Farmiga is a gal Clooney meets while on the move (of course). They compare loyalty programs and swap travel war stories. Shes instantly attractive her wry smiles and savvy business attire the natural counterpoint to Clooneys ""on the go"" persona. Jason Bateman has a nice turn as Clooneys boss and no one does dry and biting quite like Bateman. Hes a young master. Getting laid off is a psychically damaging disaster so its probably just as well that this film focuses on Clooneys experience instead. He travels through the world racking up miles doing his job to the best of his ability leaving carnage in his wake. In one sense this is a very clean movie mimicking the way modern airports feel though beneath the surface you can detect the subtle horror of the proceedings. Reitman and company are to be lauded for broaching this delicate subject at all -- an economy in shambles -- though occasionally they go at it in a sideways manner. If youre willing to listen Up in the Air is a film with things to say. That feeling you get when youre up there on an airplane loneliness mixed with jagged self-determination staring out at the world from behind your inch of plastic.

By Dana Stevens After youve seen Up in the Air check back in here and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion You can also click hereto download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. George Clooney and Vera Farmiga in Up in the Air Less than 48 hours after seeing Up in the Air (Paramount Pictures) Ive mentally downgraded it from sparkling to smug. Jason Reitmans third film has the lifespan of a state-fair churro tasty at the point of consumption it congeals soon afterward into its component ingredients of sugar and lard. If youre watching carefully this disillusioning process happens during the movie but the power of George Clooneys personality is such that its tough to pinpoint the moment of decline. Clooney is one of our great natural resources but his power must be carefully husbanded lest it destroy us all. Fantastic Mr. Fox deployed the Cloonforce with finesse. But in Up in the Air the actors charm is used like caulking to plaster over plot holes and disguise the conventionality of the story beneath. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. That paragraph came off as so much meaner toward this movie than I actually feel. Like Reitmans Juno Up in the Air is full of clever one-liners winning performances and wistful indie music. Its impossible not to like it which is precisely whats so annoying about it. This is the kind of film that will hoover up every award in sight through sheer inoffensiveness. As of this writing its already garnered the best-picture best-actor best-supporting-actress and best-adapted-screenplay prizes from the mysterious entity known as the National Board of Review. If Up in the Air werent gliding inexorably into an awards season of near-guaranteed over-recognition it would be free to just be what it is a frothy little romantic comedy with a couple of solemn nods to the recession economy and a scorching-hot leading couple. Advertisement Clooney plays Ryan Bingham a professional downsizer who flies around the country firing people from their jobs. Ryan spends 322 days a year in airports rental cars and chain hotels--and loves it. Hes a rootless soul whos more at home in transit than in his own apartment a featureless white box in Omaha Neb. Ryan travels light both literally and figuratively; hes unmarried semi-estranged from his family and his dearest dream is to reach the 10-million-mile mark on his frequent-flyer account. During a layover he hooks up with a woman who can match him platinum card for platinum card the hypercompetent self-assured Alex (Vera Farmiga) who assures Ryan shes equally averse to commitment. (""Imagine me as you but with a vagina."") Ryans officious boss Craig (Jason Bateman) wants to switch the company over to a Skype-based firing system to save on travel expenses so he hires a fresh-out-of-college whiz kid Natalie (Anna Kendrick) and sends her out on the road with Ryan to learn the ropes of ""career transition counseling."" The generational contrast between Ryan and Natalie is nicely drawn Shes idealistic when it comes to love but perfectly fine with firing people remotely by computer. Ryan on the other hand is mistrustful of all human relationships but a firm believer in the personal touch when it comes to job termination. After a wild all-night party on a corporate yacht Ryan decides to make Alex his date for his sisters wedding in Wisconsin. Their relationship threatens to get deep. (A development signified by the presence of Elliott Smiths ""Angel in the Snow"" on the soundtrack. Like a lot of the pop songs Reitman chooses its beautiful but distracting. At least in Juno the indie soundtrack was composed of songs the characters might conceivably have listened to. Its unlikely that Clooneys middle-aged corporate warrior would groove to college radio.) Farmiga and Clooney have an old-time screwball chemistry bracingly transposed to a modern setting. If you can imagine Cary Grant and Barbara Stanwyck sexting youre pretty much there. The early scenes they have together could not be snappier better-paced or more smoldering which is why its so disappointing when later plot developments plonk the couple into prosaic contemporary rom-comville--the land where people have sudden epiphanies and run through crowded airports. Reitman has a gift for mildly satiric populist entertainments but why does he have to set his sights so low? The Walter Kirn novel that inspired this film was a scathing satire of corporate happyspeak and late-capitalist alienation. Reitman is entitled to soften it up for his purposes but in his hands Ryans story takes on a redemptive quasi-humanist glow that seems untrue not only to the source material but to the character himself. Up in the Air begins and ends with montages of people speaking into the camera about the ego-shattering experience of being laid off. These people are played by real-life victims of the recession Reitman put out a casting call in several U.S. cities to gather their testimony and their stories even out of context are moving. But theres something instrumentalizing about the way these interviews are shoehorned in for dramatic effect especially when Reitman seamlessly cuts from the faces of out-of-work Americans to the familiar comic mugs of J.K. Simmons or Zach Galifianakis playing out-of-work fictional characters. But its not too late for Reitman to make it up to those whose misery served as a backdrop for what seems likely to be his most successful film to date. He can thank them in his Oscar speech.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Clooney plays career-transition counselor Ryan Bingham. His job is to fire you from your job. Ryan has a sterile apartment in Omaha Nebraska. But hes rarely there. For 322 days a year hes in and out of airportsstopping only to whack work slaves whose bosses dont have the stomach for it. Ryan looks you in the eye shakes your hand and claims being canned isnt a tragedy its an opportunity. Up in the Air is a defining movie for these perilous times. The firing scenes only hurt when you laugh which is constantly. The reactions of Zach Galifianakis and J.K. Simmons when the ax falls are priceless. But Reitman also uses nonactors playing versions of their own stories who help make this the best and boldest American comedy of the year. All praise to Clooney who uses humor as a portal to a deeper darker place. This is star acting of a high order and Clooney makes it look easy which is why hes as good as it gets. Clooneys eyes reflect Ryans avidity for hotels cars and reaching his goal of 10 million frequent-flier miles. Ryan even lectures about keeping your life down to what you can fit in one backpack. This sprinting champ of airport check-in can measure his physical and emotional baggage in ounces. As he says ""The slower we move the faster we die."" So far the film follows the map laid out by Walter Kirn in his 2001 novelan a stringent song of the open road. But in working with co-scripter Sheldon Turner in the years since Reitman has let hard times and his own transition from single life to marriage and fatherhood seep into the script. The change starts by putting two women into Ryans path. Alex (Vera Farmiga) is an executive who shares his travel routine and his jones for elite status. ""Im you with a vagina"" she teases. They jump into bed and a close call with commitment. Whether her films are indie (Down to the Bone) or mainstream (The Departed) Farmiga is a major talent. But this is her breakout performance. Shes combustibly smart and sexy and her sparring with Clooney is classic. Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who dismisses Ryan as ""old"" is a 23-year-oldfirebrand out of Cornell hired by Ryans boss (Jason Bateman making slime so tasty you hunger for more) to lay off workers more efficiently by computer. Thats when Ryan takes her on the road to prove her wrong. Kendrick (Bellas perky bud in the Twilight series) is a revelation. Watching her lose her fiance and her tightly held control is hilarious and heartbreaking. Ryan travels light but Reitmans movie aches for human connection. In amajor shift Ryan breaks his routine to attend the wedding of his sister (Melanie Lynskey) to a reluctant groom (Danny McBride). Its Ryan who sells him on marriage without really selling himself on the message that ""Everyone needs a co-pilot."" The movie is rightly ambiguous about what Ryan needs. Reitman is incisively funny at showing the work force getting its options squeezed. But no way is he kidding. And no way does this movie -- his finest yet -- take the easy way out.

I admire the audacity of the script which was written by Will Reiser from personal experience and I laughed in most of the right places as people in Adams life struggle often absurdly to say or do the right thing. Yet my feelings about the film which was directed by Jonathan Levine hover around 60/40. I wish it well and wish it were better. ENLARGE Anna Kendrick Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen in 50/50. Summit Entertainment The best parts are the in-between ones neither laugh-out-loud funny nor overtly heart-wrenching a silent prologue in which Adam an NPR radio reporter in Seattle reveals his earnest somewhat passive nature by waiting for a dont-walk sign on an early-morning jog through empty streets; the stirrings of Kyles good and generous heart when it isnt outpaced by his potty mouth which he deploys as a defense against the pain he feels for his friend; the tinkly ridiculousness of the New Age pap that Katherine plays as background music for her patients relaxation exercises or her sweet confusion about the efficacy versus the propriety of touching Adams arm during their therapy sessions. Since ""50/50"" makes light--and dark--of nothing less than the prospect of death it can get you when youre least expecting to be got sometimes with nothing more than a glance at Adams face in gaunt repose. (Mr. Gordon-Levitt does impeccable work throughout.) And Kyles effusions which flow from his self-appointed role as Adams life coach and one-man support group can be just what the doctor didnt order to clear the stuffy air cut through the surrounding solemnity shore up Adams spirits and for whatever it may be worth in the end flip the bird to the Grim Reaper. Watch a clip from the film ""50/50"" about a man suddenly diagnosed with cancer starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen. Courtesy Summit Entertainment. Mr. Rogen is Hollywoods reigning maestro of burbling raunch. Much of his stuff is extremely funny--not just funny but surprising because Kyles mind is quick enough to keep us guessing about where its taking his tongue. But the more Mr. Rogen injects the story with needed energy the more he makes Kyles reflexive glibness seems like his own glib self-congratulatory shtick and the closer he comes to wearing out his welcome by dominating the movie. Secondary characters pale by comparison. You understand that Adams oncologist and anesthesiologist are deeply repressed--as the writers doctors may well have been in real life--but theyre written and played monotonously almost polemically to sell the point. Secondary scenes like one in which Adam first tries to use his cancer as a pick-up line are written sloppily in broad strokes that blur the reality of his plight. Where ""50/50"" comes delightfully alive is in its ever more romantic encounters between Adam who desperately needs a special someone to hold him together and Katherine who given her pack-rat predilections and her pitiful inexperience seems the least likely of Seattles therapists to do so. Take a step back and you see that Ms. Kendrick is playing the familiar cliche of a wacko shrink but this extraordinary comedienne never steps back for a moment. Shes into her character with such verve that she makes Katherine a shining example of transference for all concerned. Theres no way for Adam not to love her as we do. Take Shelter Michael Shannon a tall man with a searching gaze gives a towering performance as Curtis a plainspoken husband and loving father suddenly beset by schizophrenia. ""Take Shelter"" is only the second feature to be written and directed by Jeff Nichols but its a dazzling piece of filmmaking and much of the dazzle--as well as the anguished darkness--comes from Adam Stones cinematography which expresses the swirling state of Curtiss mind with richly varied flavors of light. (The original score all a-throb with scary incipience was composed by David Wingo.) ENLARGE Michael Shannon in Take Shelter. Sony Pictures Classics The title works on at least two levels. Curtis; his wife Samantha (another fine performance by Jessica Chastain whos been giving lots of them lately); and their hearing-impaired 6-year-old Hannah (Tova Stewart) live in rural Ohio where tornado shelters are part of the landscape. But tornados are a dominant part of Curtiss delusions. Hes so obsessed by imagined storms that he takes out a loan he cant afford to turn his little backyard shelter into a huge and expensive bunker that represents safety for him and his family and the depths of his subconscious for us. The images of his apocalyptic dream life and waking nightmares are mesmerizing and eventually all-embracing as the boundaries between reality and dementia blur in what amounts to a psychological thriller. Yet the images of small-town life are no less vivid and entirely free of comment or condescension a pleasant yard sale a Lions Club lunch a meadow bright beneath a cloudless sky. ""Take Shelter"" is full of sharply yet generously observed cameos Curtiss canny co-workers on his construction jobs; a local banker concerned with the loans risk; a free-clinic counselor who knows she cant give Curtis the psychiatric care he desperately needs. Watch a clip from the film Take Shelter. From the director of Shotgun Stories the film stars Michael Shannon. And the care Curtis knows he needs. The character as written by Mr. Nichols is insightful up to a point; his schizophrenic mother experienced her first psychotic break in her 30s and hes terrified that the same fate seems to be overtaking him at the same age. The character as played by Mr. Shannon transcends the thriller genre and the increasingly flat affect of Curtiss disease with a hurtling inevitability that culminates in two sequences of enormous power. (The penultimate and intentionally prosaic dramatic beat sets up a stunning climax.) ""Take Shelter"" which could have been called ""The Storms Before the Storm"" isnt the sort of film youd seek out for fun and relaxation. Its ultimately a bleak vision and a circumscribed one but remarkable all the same and proof that Mr. Nichols is ready for much bigger things. Weekend So much movie can be made with so little plot given sufficient humanity and dramatic tension. Thats the case with Andrew Haighs eloquent chamber piece which stars Tom Cullen and Chris New as Russell and Glen youngish Englishmen who come together in a gay bar for what promises to be a one-night stand and turns out to last a weekend. The first sign of something deeper comes from Glen who claiming to be an artist asks Russell to confide his hopes and expectations for the liaison to a little cassette recorder. ""Its for an art project"" Glen explains. Its also a way to suggest in what might otherwise be flat exposition why Russell has been stuck in a holding pattern of loneliness. Mr. Cullen makes him instantly likable and readily understandable not just as a gay man who hasnt quite come out but as a man who for all his intelligence and kindness hasnt figured out how to move on from the sterile safety that loneliness confers. Glen for his part professes tough-minded independence--friends he says can be like ""a noose around your neck""--though that facade breaks down bit by ironic bit. Much of the talk is about sex and much of the sex is candid; this is not a movie that looks the other way whether Russell and Glen are making love or making conversation that first conceals and eventually reveals their yearnings and deep fears. Yet ""Weekend"" in which a casual hookup becomes a transforming connection isnt only about gay life. Its about loves essence and the pain of its absence.  A correction In last weeks column I misstated the movie for which Wally Pfister won an Oscar for best cinematography. It was ""Inception"" not ""The Dark Knight."" DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Up in the Air (2009) Anna Kendrick is sensationally funny as Natalie the newly minted college grad and steely careerist who shows George Clooneys Ryan a thing or two about firing people with utmost efficiency. Compared to her hes the Albert Schweitzer of the piece. When he says with a fleeting suggestion of rue ""This is what we do we take people at their most fragile and set them adrift"" she understands in her flow-charting way. But her own vision which she articulates in a stiletto voice is to dehumanize the firing process even further via the miracle of video conferencing. Pi (1998) Darren Aronofskys first feature is another extraordinary visualization of mental illness. This one could have been called ""Digit Goes to Wall Street."" Its about a math genius Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) who goes mad searching for patterns in the stock market. (Right the movies pure fantasy.) But filthy lucre isnt Maxs goal. Hes really looking for the secret of the universe while the writer-director strives for and finds a daring dialectic between human emotion (mostly bleak) and deadpan Dada that recalls Godards ""Alphaville"" the German Expressionists and Terry Gilliams retro technology in ""Brazil."" Before Sunrise (1995) Boy and girl instead of boy and boy meet by chance on a train in Europe. They talk get off the train in Vienna fall in love and talk a lot more until dawn. Meandering and quietly enchanting this early feature by Richard Linklater stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (and Vienna which looks a lot more inviting than it does in ""The Third Man""). The couple meets again nine years later in ""Before Sunset"" which has some lively moments but a great deal of slow walking and fatuous talking about love sex and married life.

In Jason Reitmans new film ""Up in the Air"" Ryan Bingham is focused on moving forward ignoring what we can see around him. Reuniting couples embrace. Fellow travelers vanish behind partitions never to be seen again. Posters of smiling pilots thank him for his loyalty. A middle-aged bachelor executive closing in on 10 million frequent-flier miles Ryan is a steady customer because it rewards him. He doesnt invest in relationships that demand human connection or emotional reciprocity; its all about perks. Hes not a bad guy he would tell you merely a realist. People weigh you down. He has a philosophy about that a slick speech about carrying your life in a backpack. Its filled with ""all the stuff you have in your life"" from knickknacks to ""your husband your wife."" The weight of those burdens will slow you down and ""the slower we move the faster we die."" Better to move continuously and alone he says. ""Were sharks."" Ryan (George Clooney) gives that talk repeatedly as he travels the country to fire long-term employees for companies too spineless to do the dirty job themselves. The backpack parable is his way of motivating the culls. Everyone who ever built an empire had to hit rock bottom first he tells them. Drop your baggage and move on. He looks them in the eye deftly guiding them through their tears and out of the office. Then its off to the airport where he is all know-how and breezy momentum in a sea of sluggish sheep. When Ryan enters his cheerless apartment you understand why hes eager to spend 270 days a year on the road. The stewardesses the first-class clubs the rental cars the hotels the drinks the streamlined corporate world all provide a safe haven. We meet this footloose confident fixer at the point where his life is beginning to unravel. Hes sabotaged by his need to love and be loved just when he must fend off sharks younger and hungrier than he is. Ryans co-workers and fellow travelers are a tough bunch. His smug boss Craig (Jason Bateman) loves insidious mind games. New co-worker Natalie (Anna Kendrick) a 23-year-old striver with the posture of a cadet and the empathy of a cobra has designed a cost-saving program to fire people by iChat. Ryan negotiates a no-strings fling with fellow business traveler Alex (Vera Farmiga) nurturing hopes that it might grow. ""Think of me as you with a vagina"" she cautions. UP IN THE AIR  1/2 OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating R (language sexual content)  Where Uptown ""Up in the Air"" is bitingly comic intelligent sad packed with moments of honest observation and true emotion. It is the third film from Reitman who is drawn to serious comedies about lives gone wrong. His films feature overconfident people who face hard decisions about the holes theyve dug for themselves. ""Thank You for Smoking"" gave us a tobacco lobbyist who tries to be a responsible father while diligently working to make the world a more cynical place. His smash hit ""Juno"" was about a precocious pregnant teen who had to learn how little she really understands about life. Here he plunges us into deeper chillier waters. There is pain in the story. Other than a few notable performers every person laid off in the film is a non-actor who was recently fired in real life. The film uses patient editing to highlight the uneasiness in conversations especially when its funny. Frames are carefully composed to reveal Ryans isolation. Even as Clooneys sublime comic timing bats zingers out of the park the film has the detached look of a psychological drama. This movie will have people arguing about it as they leave the theater. Good. Its worth arguing about. Reitman has the ideal collaborator in his star. When People magazine named Clooney the sexiest man alive they pigeonholed him with George Hamilton or Ryan ONeal glamorous flavors of the month with a short shelf life. Clooney escaped that snare by pursuing creative challenges. Here he brings clear-eyed intelligence to the role of a man beginning to recognize himself as an empty suit. It would be easy to make Ryan a louse or a hero who just needs a bit of armor polish. Clooney makes Ryan both ruthless and sympathetic. He never lies or condescends to the people hes dismissing. He hustles them through the grieving process because grief is unproductive. Hes like a skilled doctor with a clinical bedside manner. Yet in a pinch he can deliver. He comforts Natalie when a taste of her own medicine reveals the naivete and fragility beneath her go-getter facade. The film is about connections airline and otherwise. In the third act Ryan long untethered from his family must head home to Wisconsin to talk his sister and her gun-shy groom through their wedding jitters. Theres no cheap ray-of-light moment when he realizes the importance of relationships. The ceremony is just another nudge for a slow learner. The film leaves Ryan at a boarding-gate crossroads. Reitman trusts us to decide if hes about to enter a world of unlimited freedom or if he has missed a crucial connection. All we know as he scans the destinations board is that he has amassed a huge number of air miles. Was there ever a prize that sounded so empty?

Hes cheerfully clocked only he knows how many miles over the last year 322 days flying airline hub to spoke for work. That makes 322 nights comparing the minibars (and maxibabes) at Marriotts and Hiltons. Which leaves him a mere ""43 miserable days"" in home sweet Omaha.Ryan (George Clooney) is The Terminator euphemistically a Career Transition Counselor the suave bully you call when cowed by the prospect of eliminating excess employees. See Ryan train his buckshot eyes on the target about to be culled. Hear him deliver soothing platitudes about job loss as an opportunity for spiritual growth. Feel his palpable relief as he settles in his first-class seat on the way to the next gig.For Ryan happiness is a flotation device beneath the rump. The people he terminates have no such cushion.And for him a connection isnt interpersonal its the transfer you make at Terminal B.This he believes - until he meets Alex (Vera Farmiga) his female counterpart and Natalie (Anna Kendrick) his colleague women who will rock his world personally and professionally. They are him only with gal parts. Hes both turned on and scared by these mirror images the rootless careerist without home ties and the efficiency expert trying to achieve even greater economies of scale.Up in the Air Jason Reitmans nimble adaptation of the 2001 novel by Walter Kirn is perfectly tailored to Clooneys melancholy twinkle and purring motormouth. I dont know if its the best movie of the year but its the most utterly enjoyable.While it may be only Reitmans third feature (after Thank You for Smoking and Juno) the 32-year-old son of producer/director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters Stripes) has a firmer command of star and story than many veterans twice his age and experience.Rather than scripting the reactions of the newly downsized Reitman filmed the responses of real-life workers recently laid off. Their stinging earfuls are a most eloquent way of showing the human turbulence of corporate cost-cutting.A satirical account of an economy where the only growth industry is in layoffs Up in the Air is also a ruefully funny portrait of a culture preoccupied with elite memberships bonus points and upgrades - empty status symbols in uneasy times. The scene where Ryan and Alex show each other whats inside their wallets may be one of the funniest pickup sequences ever but it also speaks to the characters status anxiety.Farmiga (The Departed) is as always sublime a human version of the hot-and-cold patch you get to treat a bruised muscle. In this movie the muscle is Ryans heart.Did I mention how great Clooney is? In recent years hes become the go-to guy for movies about recovering cynics. But never before has he conveyed the extent to which his characters lightness of spirit was a means of allaying fears of the dark.Ryan may not be admirable but Clooney makes him relatable. Its his deepest and nakedest performance one that plays into his public persona as the guy who flies solo and deserves all the award recognition it will get.His Ryan speaks with velvet-voiced authority. Listen closely and you hear the fraying nerves. What might happen if the man who draws a paycheck from downsizing could himself be downsized? What might happen if inside this lone ranger was a lonely guy hankering to couple up? What might happen if the man flying high above layoffs could be grounded?Contact movie critic Carrie Rickeyat 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Every day Ryan Bingham gets up showers and dresses leaves his anonymous hotel room and goes to some office park where he does the job hes hired to do firing people. Its all done in short scripted phrases. Regret to inform you. ""Right-sizing."" Look at this as an opportunity. Can I have your keycard? Please look over this information packet. Thank you for your time. Up in the Air (R) Paramount (109 min.) Directed by Jason Reitman. With George Clooney Vera Farmiga Anna Kendrick. Now playing in New York. Stephen Whittys rating Four Stars Ratings note The film contains sexual situations nudity strong language and alcohol abuse. And then after hes fired all those people whose own bosses are too spineless to do it he goes back to his hotel room packs his carry-on and flies off to the next town. How does he sleep at night? Well rarely alone actually. And without thinking about what hes really doing or who those other people were. Except when finally hes forced to. There probably isnt a more hated character in America right now than Ryan Bingham. And yet ""Up in the Air"" makes him its hero. And it works thanks to director Jason Reitman and star George Clooney both of whom are in peak form. Reitman has always been a bit of a contrarian coming at things from a different angle making you sympathize with the cancer salesman of ""Thank You for Smoking"" or having ""Juno"" not keep her baby but sensibly give it up. His movies take unexpected turns. A clip from Up in the Air with George Clooney A clip from Up in the Air with George Clooney George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham and Anna Kendrick plays Natalie Keener in Jason Reitmans new film Up in the Air. They also do it with style. His earlier films showed a taste for clever editing and thematic soundtracks; here he does it by having some of the laid-off workers -- played by real-life laid-off workers -- look directly at the camera and tell Bingham off. (And maybe bitterly us if were still lucky enough to have jobs.) Clooney is perfect too. The usual impulse is to cast a role such as this with an actor like Kevin Spacey; the genius is to cast it with someone the audience likes. That immediately draws them in but then it makes them squirm once he starts acting like a creep. William Holden played these parts brilliantly; Jack Lemmon had his day too. Now its Clooneys turn as the man whos able to hurt people because he never gets close to anyone who can decimate entire companies without a moments worry but frets about his frequent-flier miles. Of course this movie wouldnt have a second act if Binghams emotional wall werent eventually breached and ""Up in the Air"" presents a couple of potential invaders. One is Anna Kendrick -- best known as Bellas eye-rolling friend in the ""Twilight"" series -- who gives a charming Amy Adams-like performance as Natalie the pert associate whos here ostensibly to learn from Bingham but really also to edge him aside. George Clooney and Anna Kendrick in Up in the Air George Clooney and Anna Kendrick in Up in the Air George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham and Anna Kendrick plays Natalie Keener in Jason Reitmans new film Up in the Air. The other is Vera Farmiga the consistently taken-for-granted consistently challenging character actress. Alex her cold sex-as-an-indoor-sport business traveler is smart assured blunt and erotic. In fact shes nearly Binghams mirror image; ""Think of me as you with a vagina"" she tells him. But both of these women will begin eventually to poke holes in that very nice wall that Bingham has constructed around himself. By the end of the film he will not be quite the same cocky corporate hatchet man he was at the beginning. But the movie doesnt telegraph those changes. Instead it moves us along so efficiently so quietly -- like one of those smooth concierges at the hotels Bingham frequents -- that we hardly notice the work. Instead we merely enjoy the journey delighting in the very adult back-and-forth badinage of Alex and Bingham. Or the scenes at a family wedding that give us a little idea of where Bingham came from and how far hes run. Or the real -- almost too real -- scenes of the laid-off as they unburden their ears their tears and their pain. The corporate world can be a testosterone-fueled one and sometimes ""Up in the Air"" succumbs to that; its odd that we never find out what Farmigas character does for a living (and unfair as the actress herself has said that shes the only one whos naked in the love scene.) But those are quibbles and more than addressed as the film glides to a perfect landing leaving several characters changed one coldly untouched and nothing up in the air at all -- except perhaps the question of what this very talented crew is going to do next.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Ryan Bingham the protagonist of Jason Reitmans warm smoothly made comedy ""Up in the Air is another of George Clooneys playboy loners. They live inside a membrane of narcissism until some force - be it love or justice - attempts to break in.In ""Up in the Air the membrane is punctured early. Ryan works for a consulting firm that companies hire to reduce their staff. The firm is thinking of cutting back itself. Ryans boss - played by Jason Bateman doing unctuous as only he can like a 21st-century Dabney Coleman - has brought in a sharp young woman named Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) to slash the companys travel budget by 85 percent. With her giant ponytail power suits and ludicrous lexicon (""glocal is her term for ""global and ""local) shes like a corporate warrior sent from a business-school hatchery. Even her toothy smile is a kind of occupational armor.Natalies big idea is to fire people over video chats so the consulting staff rarely has to leave its home base in Omaha. The announcement floors Ryan. Worse hes been instructed to take this high-efficiency robot on the road with him. Sitting at a meeting with a dozen or so co-workers he looks sick. We feel his pain. Very liberally adapted from Walter Kirns 2001 novel the movie presents the entire corporate travel galaxy (Kirn called it Airworld) as a rarefied resort.Ryan travels the way Roger Federer plays tennis. ""To know me is to fly with me he tells us. The object of Ryans desire is not a woman (those are among the perks). Hes in pursuit of 10 million frequent flier miles on American Airlines.At its best ""Up in the Air invents new realms for old Hollywood sophistication. The sequined cocktail festivities and crack banter are now happening in the Admirals Club lounge and at corporate blowouts where everyone parties while wearing a name badge. And Reitmans team captures it all expertly Editor Dana E. Glauberman makes shockingly sleek work of packing and wielding roller bags while cinematographer Eric Steelberg sexes up Americas hotel bars.This wholly artificial world exists on the once-bloated underbelly of the dot-com bubble. In a way it even predicts the post-apocalyptic space colonies of ""WALL-E. But in this lousy economy it all feels glamorous. And never more so than when Clooney spies Vera Farmiga nursing a drink at an airport bar.Farmiga plays Alex - Venus Williams to his Federer. Alex is unattached and equally horny for both sex and the perks of business travel. In one of the most comically romantic movie exchanges Ive seen in a long time they turn each other on with the emblems of their corporate loyalty (Avis and Budget and Hertz oh my). These two dont know the language of love. Ryan and Alex speak Expedia (""Theyve got multiples at SDF. You think you could push?). For the first time since Catherine Zeta-Jones in ""Intolerable Cruelty Clooney has a woman who equals him not only in wattage but in weight class. Farmiga exists somewhere between movie star and character actor. Ultimately shes neither and both at the same time. Yet her confident handling of a far more famous costar - like hes just another suit - is an inspired approach.Clooney is good in a more paternal way with Kendrick currently a wanted woman for stealing scenes as a motormouth in the second ""Twilight movie. She should be under arrest for doing the same here. Her breathless know-it-all style is something new for the movies the ingenue as MBA.When Ryan and Alex wind up in bed together - or near it (""I like how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions she says) - Ryan whos done this sort of thing before wonders if theyve moved too fast. She tells him ""Were two people who get turned on by elite status. I think cheap is our starting point. Her reply would bring a tear to Ben Hechts eye. It almost does the same to Ryan.At this point ""Up in the Air becomes harder for Reitman to manage. The movies sharp edges become ever so slightly dulled by the sentimental banalities of family ties. Both Natalie whose boyfriend has just dumped her and Ryans unhappily married older sister (Amy Morton wonderfully blunt) remind him that he needs to grow up and settle down. Hes been instructed to come home to chilly Wisconsin for the wedding of his younger sister Julie (Melanie Lynskey) whos never seen the world but would like to.As Ryan makes his way toward the wedding it becomes clear that ""Up in the Air is actually several good movies - a workplace comedy romantic comedy and family comedy - seated on the same flight in the same aisle. They all feel forced together. The montages of unemployed men and women discussing their professional worth are touching but they feel a touch apologetic too as if the movie has to atone for the fun its been having.The movie has traces of the same sitcom glibness that trivialized Reitmans ""Juno and parts of his ""Thank You for Smoking. A film about the unemployed and the man who lays them off should leave you angrier than this one does. The comic paranoia in Kirns novel easily lends itself to dark satire. Reitmans adaptation with Sheldon Turner swaps alienation for a champagne fizz.I could watch Clooney and Farmiga burrito each other all day. I could listen to Alex give Natalie perceptive relationship advice too. But in the real world the ordinary people and their low-flying lives devoid of perquisites are at odds with the alluring aquariums the movie has made of those airports planes hotels and private boat parties.Standing in the Wisconsin snow Ryan is a fish out of water flopping for a purpose. The perverse achievement of ""Up in the Air is that we ache for him to be scooped up and restored to the fantasy of his natural corporate habitat.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet George Clooney plays a man who has perfected a dubious but widely applicable skill in Up In The Air He fires people. But firing is a harsh word so he doesnt use it unless he has to. Instead he informs employees their jobs will no longer be available. Then he deflects the abuse they heap on him consoles them as they break down hands them an informational packet and leaves them forever. Somewhere along the line he also offers some advice that makes their dismissals sound like the beginning of a glorious new tomorrow. Its canned but it sounds sincere coming from Clooney and not just because he offers it with an unblinking gaze that suggests utter conviction. He really believes it. Or at the very least he believes in a life without attachments in which he drifts from airport lounge to hotel room while racking up an inhuman number of frequent-flier miles and returning to his sparsely appointed Omaha apartment only when need requires. ""Living is moving"" Clooney tells a group at one of his occasional motivational lectures. He subscribes to the converse logic as well Anything or anyone that slows him weighs his existence down with death. Clooney is so charming in Up In The Air that its easy to believe he might be right and the film works best when it keeps the abyss over which he glides in the corner of the screen while challenges to his preferred way of life present themselves in the form of three women. One is a fellow perpetual traveler (Vera Farmiga) with whom he forms an instant bond using shared experiences and a glowing sexual chemistry. Another is his sister (Melanie Lynskey) whose impending marriage forces him to think about his family for the first time in years. Then theres a fresh-out-of-college co-worker (Anna Kendrick) whos wowed their boss (Jason Bateman) by introducing some video-conferencing techniques that would make travel unnecessary. To train her and hopefully prove her wrong Clooney takes her on the road. Jason Reitmans direction nicely translates the seductive appeal of sterile public places while letting the assured performances do much of the work. The film isnt shy about laying out its themes but Clooneys understated work at the center lends them added complexity. Sure hes missing out on what a lot of people value in life but he doesnt seem to mind. Until inevitably he does. Yet what Up In The Air lacks in surprises--apart from an elusive final scene--it compensates for by conveying the pleasures of living from landing to landing and the terror of floating away.

"Up in the Air | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; up-in-the-air ) Up in the Air (United States 2009) December 02 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Up in the Air is a wonderful little film (the word ""little"" being relative of course). It was the best thing I saw at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and it stand up as well away from the peculiar atmosphere of the festival as it did within the hermetically sealed environment. This is George Clooneys third film of the Oscar season (the other two being The Men Who Stare at Goats and the animated Fantastic Mr. Fox) and the one most likely to be acknowledged by the Academy. With director Jason Reitman behind the camera making his follow-up to Juno (a more successful one I might add than Diablo Codys) this is far from 100% formula and thats the reason why the marketing campaign is being handled carefully. The film needs to build word-of-mouth to find an audience and Im here to do what I can to help along the effort. Reitman brings the same mixture of comedy and drama to this movie that he brought to Juno. Theres some funny laugh-out-loud material here but the characters and their situations are well-developed. None of the three principals ever veer in the direction of caricature and Clooney is especially convincing as the lead. Playing a role 180 degrees opposite to the one he essays in The Men Who Stare at Goats Clooney reminds us why he is among this generations most consistent and reliable actors. It helps immeasurably that Clooneys supporting female duo is in top form. Vera Farmiga who not unlike Tilda Swinton has the uncanny ability be entirely credible as a sultry siren or a frumpy housewife provides Clooneys perfect foil. Shes in ""upscale"" mode here; their verbal jousts are memorable and the sexual chemistry between them sizzles. No less impressive is Anna Kendrick whose performance as the ingA(c)nue getting some hard life lessons allows us to forgive her appearing in the Twilight series. Shes easily dismissed in those; here she shows that she has acting chops and knows what to do with them. Clooney plays corporate layoff officer Ryan Bingham a man whose most salient quality is his impermanence. He spends his days traveling from city-to-city and for a fee he delivers news of layoffs to soon-to-be-departed employees. He lives his life in hotels airplanes and airports saying ""All the things you hate about flying are warm reminders Im home."" In the past year he has spent 322 days on the road and 43 ""miserable"" days in the one-bedroom unit he rents in Omaha. He has no time for relationships or possessions and his one goal in life is to collect 10000000 miles so he can become the seventh member of that oh-so-rare club. Two events add chaos to Ryans ordered existence. The first is a chance meeting with fellow traveler Alex (Vera Farmiga) who expresses herself this way ""Think of me as yourself only with a vagina."" In Alex Ryan finds someone with whom he might actually be able to develop a semi-normal relationship even if it is predominantly in hotels and airports. Meanwhile at home base Ryans boss Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) has decided to implement a radical new strategy proposed by new hire Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) - using teleconference technology to allow remote layoffs. Determined to prove to her that this is not the way to go Ryan brings Natalie on the road with him with unexpected results. Up in the Air is one of the best movies to deal with the inhumanity of the way corporations cut work forces. The parody is razor-sharp and unflinching. Reitman nails his targets one-by-one and drives home each spike with resolute force. Ryan represents a fascinating specimen - a product of modern technology and todays culture - whose goal is almost the exact opposite of the ""American dream."" He doesnt want the house the wife or the children. He is almost estranged from his two sisters. And his relationships consist of one-night stands in airport hotels. Hes a master at what he does yet because of the way Clooney plays him we sympathize with this guy even though he thrives on the misery of others. All of the charisma and intelligence and wit almost make his lifestyle seem bizarrely desirable until those moments when the curtain is peeled back and we see the chilly loneliness that resides within Ryans cupboard. At times Up in the Air looks and feels a little like a romantic comedy but thats illusory. Ryans relationship with Alex is a secondary plot - a way to illustrate things about him and to provide some tightly-scripted dialogue. (There is a brilliant sequence in which Alex and Natalie detail their very different expectations of the ideal mate.) The movie earns its ending; it may come as a surprise to some viewers but it is foreshadowed and makes perfect sense in hindsight. Up in the Air never cheats and delivers an almost perfect mix of humor satire and underplayed drama. (By the way the first trailer for Up in the Air is excellent. Its extremely well put together and gives a sense of what the film is about without giving away specific plot elements. The second trailer is more conventional and not nearly as impressive. I have linked to the preferred one below - hopefully the link stays active.)

The rather whiny tone of Walter Kirns ""Up in the Air"" vanishes in Jason Reitmans extreme makeover of this travelogue comedy about a guy who traipses across America firing people for a living while greedily counting the miles built up in his frequent-flyer program. Gone is the books fickle possibly amnesiac definitely disturbed main character replaced by a lovably overconfident road-trip warrior a dynamo played to perfection by George Clooney. Gone or transformed are many of Kirns fly-by-night bit players swapped out for strong supporting figures led by Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick. And mostly gone is the self-absorbed narrowness of Kirns story a one-man show for which Reitman has substituted an expansive very relevant tale of corporate downsizing and the people suffering through it. For two-thirds of the journey ""Up in the Air"" flies even straighter and truer than director Reitmans 2007 teen-pregnancy hit ""Juno"" delivering snappy screwball dialogue with deep touches of pathos. The film strays off course in the final act though veering from an insightful portrait of willful disconnection in our age of portability and turning kind of mushy kind of vague kind of conventional. People change lessons are learned but the movie ends up landing on familiar turf rather than the bold exotic location where it seemed bound early on. Advertise Advertise Advertise Reitman who shares screenwriting credit with Sheldon Turner jettisons the hazy meandering of Kirns protagonist whos grown weary of his traveling ways and is looking for an out. Instead Clooneys Ryan Bingham lives for the life of airports rented cars and executive suites. He expertly maneuvers from hub to hub staying only long enough to pass out pink slips and offer a semblance of career-transition counseling to the people he fires for downsizing companies whose bosses are too spineless to do the nasty deeds themselves. Video Up in the Air L.A. premiere Ryans main goal is to reach the 10 million-mile plateau on his frequent-flyer account an aspiration jeopardized when his own firm decides to implement a program of firing people by teleconference so they never have to leave the home office. Just as Ryan meets his goddess of the skies frequent-flyer soulmate Alex (Farmiga) his company dispatches him with straight-out-of-school efficiency expert Natalie (Kendrick) to test the firing-from-a-distance technology that threatens to ground him for good.

Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom ""Up in the Air"" peaks too soon with a marvelous exchange in an anonymous airport as Ryan Alex and Natalie debate and dissect one anothers values with grand humor but incisorlike ferocity. From there the movie descends to a safer altitude offering up a big though somewhat contrived dramatic twist as Ryan reconnects with his family and begins to question the worthiness of his rambling. Slideshow George Clooney Everything about the production is first-class slick design a well-chosen soundtrack and awards-worthy performances from Clooney Farmiga and Kendrick along with good turns from a supporting cast that includes ""Juno"" co-star Jason Bateman as Ryans boss and Melanie Lynskey and Danny McBride as Ryans soon-to-be wed sister and her fiance. Reitman regular J.K. Simmons has a small but memorable part as one of Ryans angry downsizing victims while Sam Elliott (who appeared in Reitmans ""Thank You for Smoking"") pops up in a wry cameo that caps off Ryans air-miles quest. In a brilliant stroke Reitman found real people who lost their jobs during the recession to go on camera and share their pain weaving them into montages that bring tearful authenticity to the anguish Ryan leaves in his wake. As he showed with ""Thank You for Smoking"" Reitman has an impeccable talent for tearing out the spine of a novel and transposing it to the big screen streamlining and simplifying a literary work without dumbing it down. In its way Reitmans ""Up in the Air"" is every bit as smart as the book. And going Hollywood has made the story one for the masses a film with great laughs and a touch of heartache that soothes even as it reflects the hard times were living through.

The beauty of Up in the Air is that its all those things at once. Adapted from Walter Kirns 2001 novel its a rare and sparkling gem of a movie directed by Jason Reitman (Juno) with the polish of a master. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) the films debonair hero is a new kind of no-sweat corporate executioner. Each day he walks into a different office somewhere in the United States -- Wichita Detroit St. Louis -- and gets a list of employees who are about to be downsized. One by one he sits opposite each of them bringing them the bad news that their bosses are too weaselly to deliver personally. The victims are mostly hardworking middle managers whove been let go because of the economy. None of them ""deserves"" to be fired and so their reactions -- terror confusion rage despair -- are notably intense even as Ryan reassures them that opportunities await that this is a beginning not an ending and blah blah blah. (Hes also a part-time motivational speaker pepping up the very sorts of people he fires.) Elevated detachment is what Ryan is all about. I mean literally elevated since most of what he does is fly around the country hopping from one frictionless job to the next. Hes got a dozen passkeys to a dozen airport VIP lounges boutique rent-a-car deals and high-end cookie-cutter hotels and the quick swipe of one of those cards expresses the joy he feels at living more or less his entire existence on the road. Ryan is a pure product of the new America an addict for a life in which everything is systemized. Hes also hooked on frequent-flier miles which he regards with nearly poetic aspiration (hes out to collect a magically large number of them). If Ryan had been played by anyone but George Clooney we might not believe in (or like) him. But Clooney with his effortless cracklingly smart yet maybe slightly-too-polished charm knows here as he did in Michael Clayton how to play a rogue whos in danger of losing his soul yet holds on to it anyway. In Up in the Air Clooney gives his most fully felt performance to date as a smooth hedonist who comes to realize that he may be drowning. This is movie-star acting of the sort that no one else today can bring off. Ryans troubles begin when Natalie (Anna Kendrick) the new bottom-line chipmunk at his firm comes up with the ""advanced"" ? notion of doing away with the traveling-?axman system so that the firings can instead take place over the Internet. Since Ryan the happy vagabond doesnt want his lifestyle to change he takes this young climber out on the road and shows her how downsizing with humanity is done. Kendrick is a fast-talking delight (she keeps revealing more layers) but there isnt meant to be a romantic spark to their sparring. Ryan saves that for Alex his sexy counterpart in corporate travel -- and a role that finally gives Vera Farmiga the chance to show off the biting sharp-eyed sensuality that makes her irresistible. Shes the homespun vixen next door. Clooney and Farmiga are fantastic together Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell for the PowerPoint age. The ""interviews"" that Ryan does with the folks he fires give you a chill. Theyre a vision of whats going on in the country today and Up in the Air is the rare film that does justice to economic desperation by expressing it with an honest populist embrace. At the same time its a movie about how one man living inside the cocoon of an overly detached culture comes to see the error of his own detachment. Up in the Air is light and dark hilarious and tragic romantic and real. Its everything that Hollywood has forgotten how to do; were blessed that Jason Reitman has remembered.

Hoberman George Clooney in Up in the Air Tuesday December 1 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Frequent-flier benefits Clooney and FarmigaDale Robinette A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Up in the Air goes down like a sedative. This is a movie thats easy to like--and to dislike as well. Less adapted from than inspired by Walter Kirns 2001 novel Jason Reitmans third feature is a glibly serious comedy about a professional terminator. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham corporate road warrior and hired gun living out of a stowable wheeled suitcase and flying first-class city to city or rather company to company discharging redundant workers. Its a job and the joke is he loves it.Of course however cool personable and deft at running the airport-security gauntlet Bingham is an antihero--even more successfully alienated than the tobacco lobbyist protagonist of Reitmans debut Thank You for Smoking he moonlights giving motivational lectures on avoiding commitment. Thus in a conciliatory nod to the people Up in the Air opens cannily with an orchestrated jaccuse. A rainbow montage of the newly laid off address their tormentor (and the audience) in tight close-up and tones ranging from pathetic (""This is what I get for 30 years at this company?"") to belligerent (""Who the fuck are you?"").Sound familiar? Up in the Air is the most topical Hollywood release of the season a far more scarifying disaster film than 2012 or The Road. ""This is our moment"" Binghams boss (an appropriately odious Jason Bateman) exults before dropping the bomb. His new protegee Natalie Keener a scarily confident 23-year-old efficiency expert (briskly played by professional go-getter Anna Kendrick) has developed a scheme in which firings will be handled in a central office by something like Skype. Now its Binghams job thats in peril--or rather his lifestyle.Like Reitmans Juno Up in the Air has a boom-boom-bada-boom pace and an impersonal emphatic style. Reitmans screenplay co-written with Sheldon Turner is a veritable minibar of bite-size one-liners. The tone is sassy--as when Bingham picks up and beds his female equivalent (Vera Farmiga) after a prolonged flirtation conducted in the language of car rentals. The movie is like its protagonist traveling light through a succession of sterile environments just fast enough to short-circuit thought.Bingham is the ultimate moving target. His cynicism is indistinguishable from his sincerity--especially once the plot turns. The key moment comes when Bingham intervenes in Natalies bungled firing of a plainspoken salt-of-the-earth type (none other than Junos dad and Reitman axiom J.K. Simmons). Bingham expresses empathy. This proud connoisseur of food-court sushi is meant to have feelings Clooney may be the ultimate smoothie as charming as any actor since Cary Grant but hes unable to pivot at least as his character is written. Similarly Up in the Air is most tiresome when it decides to get ""real"" shifting location to Binghams northern Wisconsin hometown. The fake folk rock used to score his kid sisters wedding accentuates the movies essential disconnect.Up in the Air means to be a critique of how we live now Social networking is a substitute for intimacy thats just as phony as Binghams doctrine of emotional self-sufficiency. Natalies cruel scheme for online firing suggests an updated gag from Chaplins Modern Times but its hardly outlandish. (I have a colleague who was fired on a conference call.) But like Juno Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away.The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes--ignoring the possibility that to paraphrase Christopher Laschs Haven in a Heartless World the precise socioeconomic forces that necessitated private life as refuge had long ago invaded that sanctuary. To lose your job in America is to risk losing everything. As articulated by the movies several subplots and clinched with a concluding rainbow montage in which the unemployed extol the comfort of their loved ones the cruelties of the free market can be ameliorated by a sentimental faith in Family Values. Up in the Air warns that you cant go home again--and then full of false cheer and false consciousness pretends you can.Religion may not be an option in Reitmans world but theres an underlying supernaturalism to its premise. Clever little Juno was the Christmas cherub of 2007 and Bingham is a spiritual creature as well--a sad one like the seraph in Wings of Desire who yearns to be human. Somewhere over Dubuque 10 million air miles into his quest he realizes that his is an existential fate--he is the capitalist systems angel of death. And yet a satire unsullied by anger Up in the Air floats above the pain. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

By Lane Vera Farmiga and George Clooney in Jason Reitmans new movie.   Credit Illustration by Robert Risko For those of us who look to the skies two major releases compel attention. They make the perfect couple. One is ""Up in the Air"" the new film from Jason Reitman who made ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno."" The other is ""Come Fly with Me"" which has been reissued on vinyl by Capitol fifty-one years after its first appearance in the unpolluted mono sound that God--or Frank Sinatra--intended. The half-century that is bracketed by the album and the film has witnessed both the expansion and the degradation of a dream. The tilt of Sinatras hat on the cover of the LP and the position of his hands (one lightly holding a womans the other motioning with jerked thumb as if a trip to Capri were as swift and painless as hitching a ride) inform us that thanks to airplanes the world is now his and ours for the asking. Whereas the face of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) in the final moments of ""Up in the Air"" as he stares at an airport departures board bears the lagged blankness of someone who has long since forgotten what to ask for. ""To know me is to fly with me"" Bingham says in an early voice-over choosing his words as ever to sound like an advertising campaign. My guess would be that he has read so many in-flight magazines over the years (we never see him with a book) that his prose rhythms have adapted accordingly just as his digestion is attuned to hotel menus and complimentary drinks. Last year he says three hundred and twenty-two days were spent travelling leaving ""forty-three miserable days at home"" in Omaha. Now and then we see his apartment and its just like a hotel suite minus the personal warmth--no room service no express checkout not even a chocolate on the pillow. Bingham is Homo peripateticus seeing neither purpose nor profit in being at rest. ""The slower we move the faster we die"" he says to a business gathering. ""We are not swans. Were sharks."" It makes sense then that this particular shark is engaged in daily kills. Bingham is part of a company run by the conscience-free Craig Gregory (Jason Bateman) that does the dirty work for the heads of other firms who lack the guts or the heart to do it themselves it fires their employees. Bingham is unparalleled at this; he could land in London at dawn dethrone the Queen explain the terms of her severance package and be out of there before breakfast. ""Up in the Air"" was shot in the first months of this year ""the worst time"" as Gregory tells his staff adding modestly ""This is our moment."" His joy at the prospect of depression is a fearsome thing and Reitman to his credit does not stint on the facts. Bingham may thrive on perks and upgrades but the grit of his job means standing around in slush-laden parking lots under gray-white skies and marching into offices where the workers go quiet and hunched at the sight of him as if he were an exorcist or a cop. Indeed the film begins with a sequence of talking heads--the faces and expostulations of the newly sacked as they respond to the life-draining news. If youre wondering why they seem so artless and sincere in their dismay thats because they are; far from being Hollywood bit players these are real victims of job loss found in St. Louis and Detroit. For all that the film is a hybrid. Its backdrop is despair but the foreground action has the silvery zest of a comedy. The traditional comic task of the American female has been to shock the male monomaniac into seeing how rich and multitudinous his bone-dry life could be. That was what Katharine Hepburn did to the ossified Cary Grant in ""Bringing Up Baby."" Whats fresh and rousing about ""Up in the Air"" is that when Bingham meets Alex (Vera Farmiga) its more like Cary Grant bumping into his twin soul. They get talking in a hotel bar--where else?--and before long they are comparing the contents of their wallets. Not money which is soiled stuff (on reflection you realize how cashless the movie is) but credit cards room keys memberships privileges and points. ""Ill bet its huge"" Alex says. ""You have no idea"" Bingham replies. He means his tally of air miles of course or rather his goal as a miles collector ten million. He sleeps with Alex that night but he still cant divulge the magic number. A fellow has to have some secrets. We never discover what Alex does except that shes a fellow-shark. Theres a wonderful image postcoitus when they sit at their laptops and find a common gap in their schedules for the next encounter; filmed from the side each becomes a mirror of the other. At no point does technology recede; from separate cities they compensate with phone sex--or rather with text sex though neither of them actually bothers with self-pleasure. Fingers are for buttons. Its on her cell phone naturally that Alex calls Bingham and confides ""I am the woman you dont have to worry about. Just think of me as yourself only with a vagina."" Is that a threat a fantasy made flesh or the only way in which warmer feelings can register between these cool ungrounded spirits? Whatever the case Alex is the role that Vera Farmiga has been waiting for because she has the inestimable gift hard to find these days of being able to ice over and then thaw in a matter of seconds. I have been a devotee since ""The Departed"" which she stole from Scorseses overblown gangsters; and the late Anthony Minghella who shared my adulation used ""Breaking and Entering"" to bring out her worldly playful toughness with a hint of wounds beneath. Here against Clooneys Bingham she wields her wits like knives but theres such grace in the wielding and she makes so free with her desires that you can feel him--and the audience--yearning to know more. And a little knowledge is a dangerous thing for a man who laughs at love. More unsettling news Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has to be strung along on his next roster of flights. She has joined the company with a plan to transform the dolorous act of termination into an iChat. Rather than travel to another town and fire people you could stay in one spot and use videoconferencing screens. Bingham is appalled on two grounds first his footloose habits would have to stop and second he does despite everything retain some principles--the least you can offer when youre destroying a human being is to do it face to face. This is clever plotting; its career-based but it also allows Reitman to double the romantic pressure since our hero now has twice as many reasons to inspect his prejudices and emerge from the safety of his shell. Thats why a touch of hokeyness intrudes by necessity in the later stages as he decides to attend the wedding of his sister (Melanie Lynskey) taking Alex as his unexpected date. We can sense his emotions--his private economy--starting to rise out of recession. Viewers must learn for themselves what happens next. Lets just say that the tension between the bleak and the blithe the prime source of this movies strength is sustained by Reitman to the end. If anything I would have tugged harder on the bleakness--jettisoned Rolfe Kents jaunty score with its pizzicati and its busy drumming in favor of something more austere. When it comes to airport movies the spectrum runs from Chris Markers ""La Jetee"" in which a fatality and the recollection of a womans face are all that is preserved in frozen images of a scene at Orly where Jacques Tati later set some of ""Playtime""; through the ruefulness of ""The Terminal"" an oddly sedentary project for a director as kinetic as Spielberg; and so to the sugared reassurance of ""Love Actually"" in which Hugh Grant solemnly announces that at places like Heathrow ""love actually is all around."" Only someone who is regularly fast-tracked through first class or has never waited five hours with kids and luggage could write so glutinous a line and ""Up in the Air"" should be read as a rebuke to wishful thinking. Airports are the seedbed for all that is most alien angering and atomized in our twenty-first-century days and there are times in this film when Clooneys eyes appear to glaze and say Come die with me. And yet he is George Clooney. The suits that Bingham wears may be a little cheap but the actors fondness for well-cut irony is intact and having divided his screen time among cranky stiffs (""Burn After Reading"" ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"") troubled defenders of honor (""Good Night and Good Luck"" ""Syriana"") and gossamer smoothies (anything with ""Ocean"" in the title) he now has his first opportunity to shuffle the three together. Bingham is both wise guy and doofus a player so expert at the rules of the game (always stand behind Asians at airport security he tells Natalie because they wear slip-on shoes) that he doesnt notice until too late that the game has hollowed him out. ""We are here to make limbo tolerable"" he says of his profession though his is the genuine purgatory. Like Cary Grant he looks down to one side and smiles whenever he is lost in thought--a hopelessly endearing tic. But those thoughts are up in the clouds.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Beyond the Call of Duty Every star of Jim Sheridans Brothers outdoes expectations. Plus a flighty adaptation of Up in the Air. _ By David Edelstein Published Nov 30 2009 ShareThis (Photo Lorey Sebastian/Courtesy of Lionsgate) Empathy must come as naturally as breathing to the Irishman Jim Sheridan director of My Left Foot In America and now the overpoweringly intimate Brothers. Working with screenwriter David Benioff (25th Hour) he skips among three protagonists and emotional states without losing the storys pulse Every narrative beat is also a heartbeat. Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal are Sam and Tommy Cahill one an upright Army captain on his way back to Afghanistan the other a delinquent newly paroled after a three-year sentence for robbery. Natalie Portman is Sams ex-cheerleader wife Grace who can barely stand the sight of Tommy. The extended family features Sam Shepard as the brothers alcoholic ex-Army dad Mare Winningham as their stepmother and Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare as Sams young daughters. Despite the title the movies center its fulcrum isnt the brothers but the whole teetering clan. When early on Sams chopper goes down in Afghanistan and word comes back that hes dead the family structure collapses and is slowly rebuilt the pieces rearranging themselves in strange new ways. Sheridan gets inside his characters heads without ever viewing them in isolation Even separated by continents no one can move without hitting someone else. Who could have guessed that the stars who made their names as nerd heroes Peter Parker and Donnie Darko could be so credibly messed-up and volatile? Maguire isnt big but his tautness radiates strength. Sam loves his family but hes driven to be with his men Single-mindedness is his goal. When hes captured and thrown in a pit with a private named Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger) he coldly orders the man to forget his familyto forget everything but his name and rankand the question as hes starved and tortured is whether hes as impregnable as he thinks he is. At times Brothers is like a less-mythical (and -pretentious) The Deer Hunter with Maguire even managing to suggest something of Robert De Niro when he was young and thin and wiredwhen you could see his every cell react. As to the other two leads Sheridan has gotten the best performances of their young lives. As much as I like Gyllenhaal Ive often found him fuzzy as if hes wary of losing control. Is that why hes so affecting here? The dissolute Tommy turns out to be as tightly wound as his older brother only too scared to focus. He looks pitifully vulnerable as he the supposedly dead Sams family and becomes protective. Portman has the kind of role that turns actresses into dullards the wife who stands and looks stricken at her man (or men) in paroxysms of rage and grief. But shes so grounded that as the others carry on your eyes keep drifting to her. Yes shes almost unbearably pretty but its her immediacy that keeps you glued to her face. Sheridan pulls you so deep into Brothers so fast that there isnt time for the alarm bell to go off that says Warning Another Traumatized-Vet Movie You never catch Sheridan or Benioff grandstanding only observing. (Brothers is based on a 2004 Danish film I havent seen but unlike most such remakes it feels organic.) The cinematographer Fred Elmes uses color to convey inner states without calling attention to itself and Jay Cassidys editing in two fraught dinner-table scenes is so exquisitely calibrated its as if the cuts were generated by the characters psyches. The crosscurrents keep you scanning the frame from Shepards subtly vibrating features (hes never been better) to the lovely girls each with her own distinct reaction. In the role of Private Williss wife a blonde actress I couldnt place was so real I scribbled something about her being a star someday. Too late Carey Mulligan has already wowed audiences in An Education. I liked her better here. Shes not as dazzling but she doesnt have to exaggerate her naivete. Sheridans actors work with their intellects fully engagedand they engage us on levels we barely knew we had. Up in the Air has a confident hum. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham a man who specializes in flying from city to city to inform workers theyve been laid off help manage their emotions and hand them their packetseverance COBRA etc. On the side he gives motivational speeches on lightening the metaphorical backpack of ones life. Bingham tells us in voice-over that hes only at home in the air and that in the past year he has spent 322 days on the road and 43 miserable days in his nearly bare Omaha apartment. Hes cool sharp briskbut we can see where the movies headed from 3000 miles away. Bingham has to learn that connections arent just things you make in airports. 1 2 Next Share this story...

The lower-case ""tiff"" the color of a pumpkin blares from posters and billboards throughout the city as a symbol of festival director Piers Handlings determination to simplify everything including the logo in a movie orgy that has clearly outgrown itself. Last year the sheer bloat of this annual circus inspired accusations of ""elitism"" and complaints that a beloved event started by three movie buffs in 1975 was ""no longer the peoples film festival."" This year in the midst of a hobbling global recession the goal is to ""return the festival to the people"" as 312 feature films flow through every projector in the city from 9 a.m. screenings for priority press to midnight-madness horror flicks featuring the latest assortment of infectious viruses rampaging zombies and flesh-eating ghouls for the unwashed masses toting sandwich bags and styrofoam cups from Starbucks. (The projectionists sleep from 2 a.m. to dawn.) I dont know about a return to simpler days but there is certainly something here for every taste. You can see documentaries about Hugh Hefner and Glenn Gould; endless tracts on the war in Iraq; Michael Moores latest assault on capitalism (blame it all on Bushs bank bailouts); Drew Barrymores making her directorial debut with Whip It starring Ellen Page on roller skates; a vampire musical called Suck; Jewish liturgy from the Coen brothers; and another loathsome barf job by Danish wacko Lars von Trier called Antichrist in which pickle-faced Charlotte Gainsbourg who always looks embalmed prunes away her genitalia with garden shears. Naturally it will show up shortly in the New York Film Festival the official depository for movies nobody wants to see where torturing the audience has become an acknowledged priority. Despite the volume of product there is evidence wherever you turn that the fat has been trimmed. Recession-cautious buyers are stoic and roughly 100 of the films on display have arrived without any distributors at all. Unlike Cannes which has an actual film market resembling a tag sale Torontos deals are more informal with the buying and selling done on cell phones and in hotel lobbies. Hollywood studios are scaling back on the swag. There are fewer exclusive dinners midnight cocktail soirees corporate sponsors red-carpet premieres limousine rentals and hairdresser appointments. Nobody seems to care much about shelling out money even for bragging rights. But George Christys coveted annual lunch at the Four Seasons went on as planned; Matt Damon hosted another charity benefit for underprivileged kids; and Joan Baez gave a free concert in the middle of the street. This year the lavish party circuit is taking a back seat to the movies and glam venues like the Rosewater Supper Club and Ultra have a lot of blank pages in their reservation books. Never mind. Swag or no swag the boldface names are here anyway. Spotted in full gridlock on the red-carpet runway Demi Moore Ann-Margret Norman Jewison Mariah Carey Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges Keanu Reeves Viggo Mortensen one-name-is-all-you-need Oprah assorted Colins (Farrell and Firth) Jennifers (Connelly and Garner but not Aniston) and Michaels (Caine Douglas Moore and J. Fox). Not to mention Bill Murray Patricia Clarkson Christopher Plummer Penelope Cruz Clive Owen Edward Norton Chris Rock Nicolas Cage Robin Wright Penn and others too famous to mention. They only stay long enough to suffer through the idiotic press conferences pose and then head for the airport. Some of them dont even have movies to plug. Theyre just here for the photo ops. George Clooney is everywhere with his hand in a bandage--a good excuse for not signing autographs. Jane Fonda is not here but sent some controversy in her place. When she heard about this years sidebar event honoring Israeli films and the city of Tel Aviv she signed a protest letter attacking the Israelis and defending Palestine which elicited an enraged response from Jon Voight her co-star in Coming Home who accused a deluded Jane of once again backing all the wrong people. Result A series that stood every chance of being ignored suddenly had a new focus of world interest. Too bad Jane and cohorts like Harry Belafonte and Wallace Shawn didnt know one of the films they boycotted was a collaboration between Israeli and Pakistani co-directors. I skipped Triage an Irish war drama with Colin Farrell as a wounded front-lines freelance photographer in Kurdistan (he lost 25 pounds for the role by living on black coffee cigarettes and two cans of tuna per day) and opted for a live auction where one of the prizes was tea with Diane Lane to ""talk Hollywood world issues and life."" Dont ask. WOLFING DOWN CLUB sandwiches and Yoo-hoos you finally try to see some movies. After years of bad advice from festival brochures and eager press agents experience (and failing eyesight) have taught me to cross off some contenders early just from the synopses like the one that ""tells the story of 13-year-old Gunther growing up in the 1980s in a household of drunks gamblers and womanizers in small-town Belgium."" Or how about ""an alcoholic actress trying to put her life together"" and ""a young mother struggling to shake a drug habit""? Sometimes the titles alone will do it (Bitch Slap Women Without Men The Men Who Stare at Goats). In all the clutter I have still managed to see some amazing films. If Toronto sets the tone for the forthcoming awards season you can plan ahead for a few riveting performances and welcome surprises. You also better plan to dress up for depression. Viggo Mortensen gives the performance of his career in the faithfully rendered film adaptation of Cormac McCarthys heartbreaking apocalyptic novel The Road. After an unspecified global catastrophe wipes out most of the world including his wife (Charlize Theron) a desperate father (a gaunt Viggo) in an attempt to stay alive takes his son on a long and dangerous journey to the sea across a burned-out America encountering cannibalism rape and other bleak nightmares amid the last remnants of human life (Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce among them). Artistically rendered by director John Hillcoat sensitively adapted by Joe Penhall hauntingly shot in many of the post-Katrina landscapes in southern Louisiana and wonderfully acted (especially by Viggo whose face has been described as an El Greco etching) The Road is a tremendous achievement. George Clooney is unveiling two alleged ""comedies"" simultaneously--one good the other an insufferable disaster. In Jason (Juno) Reitmans smart cynical and witty Up in the Air the suave Hollywood film personality his fans have erroneously labeled ""the new Cary Grant"" plays a cool emotionally detached and swellegantly groomed businessman whose job is to fly around America downsizing companies and firing people. Hes a termination specialist whose only goal in life is to rack up 10 million frequent flyer miles. But fate intervenes when he meets a tough cookie played by the fantastic Vera Farmiga and all bets are off when he breaks his own rules falls in love against his better judgment and finds his heart. The payoff (a basically venal character who deceptively appears to have everything already reevaluates his career priorities when he learns how much hes been missing) is not as sappy as it sounds and the ending is a kick in the shins. Up in the Air often looks like an American Airlines commercial and I wouldnt call it a feel-good movie per se but theres a certain satisfaction watching two snappy beautiful people at the top of their form. Mr. Clooney has never looked better acted with more confidence or oozed more charm but hes no Cary Grant.

In ""Up in the Air"" the highly anticipated third feature from ""Juno"" director Jason Reitman Clooney plays a man who likes to control his enviornment. As the corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham he portrays the standard overly confident hustler hiding doubt behind a smirking facade. Like a vaguely sentimental Michael Clayton Bingham relishes his dirty work treating the art of the firing process as his personalized religion. Trading a settled life for the swirl of work addiction hes a lonely guru of his own making. Based on the novel by Walter Kirn ""Up in the Air"" focuses on Bighams solemn existence drifting around the country on a constant mission of letting people down in style. With recession in full swing business is booming for Bingham turning him into a thoroughly modern symbol. ""We are here to make limbo tolerable"" he explains to his mechanically driven new recruit (Anna Kendrick) to repudiate her systematic approach. But in the process of putting a human face on the looming threat of downsizing Bingham loses touch with his own needs. He grows addicted to the tenuous safety zones of comfy hotel rooms and airport lobbies relegating his place in the world -- as one close confidante observes -- to ""a cocoon of self-banishment."" With three highly likable movies to his name Reitman has established himself as thoroughly competent filmmaker but he constantly avoids a singular voice. ""Up in the Air"" does not resemble ""Juno"" or ""Thank You for Smoking"" in any regard beyond the fact that all of them focus on moody intelligent creatures addicted to the flawed belief that theyre smarter than everyone else. Binghams underlying weakness comes out when he falls for the equally smarmy Alex (Vera Farmiga) another weary traveler with a similarly nomadic lifestyle. Nevertheless he refuses to admit his need to settle down. ""I tell people how to avoid commitment"" he claims. He relishes the opportunity to issue lay offs as a means of bringing people down to his level of dissatisfaction so he can convince them that its not so bad. During his speaking engagements he applies a simplistic ""empty backpack"" metaphor to explain how key to happiness lies in cutting loose. The advice rings hollow Reitman constantly frames Clooney boxed in sadly gazing out windows and grappling to retain his grasp on reality. Populated by a handful of assured performances ""Up in the Air"" is first and foremost an actors movie. In addition to steady deliveries from Clooney Farmiga and Kendrick the movie also contains significant roles for typically comedic actors Jason Bateman and Danny McBride each of whom display previously unforeseen range. Gently witty the movie takes some time to find a fully engaging groove especially when you consider the ecstatic welcome it has received from the critical establishment. The bulk of the running time is smoothly engaging perhaps even more than usual because movies about midlife crisis tend to drag. The final third however emboldens the strength of the entire picture as Bingham finally confronts his depressing nature. Theres a wholly non-commercial touch to the implication that nothing really changes in an insulated life. In the early scenes of ""Up in the Air"" Bingham jokingly wonders ""Who the fuck am I?"" The answer delivered in the magnificent final shot is sweepingly tragic and impossible to forget.

Stories characters movies are their product and their physicality is the seductive packaging. That makes movie stars the industrys supersalesmen. And no one closes a deal with more assurance or grace than George Clooney. Not that all his pictures are blockbusters. Since A Perfect Storm in 2000 only the Oceans (Eleven Twelve Thirteen) capers have topped 100 million at the domestic box office. But Clooney -- handsome and affable and blessed with a wit that can charm and cut -- is surely the modern idea and ideal of stardom. Other celebrities seem tortured by public attention; Clooney bathes in it. He loves making the sale. This time of year the salesman goes on the road to showcase his new wares at the Venice and Toronto film festivals. He showed up last week on the Lido a couple of hundred miles from his vacation villa on Lake Como both to present his Iraq war comedy The Men Who Stare at Goats and to unveil his new inamorata TV presenter Elisabetta Canalis. When the film broke down at the evening screening Clooney serenaded the audience with a comic-opera rendition of O Sole Mio that wouldnt make Placido Domingo envious but did wow the crowd. This weekend hes in Toronto with two films Goats and Jason Reitmans Up in the Air -- which to end the suspense right here is one of the festivals and the years best movies. At a press conference yesterday when asked why he doesnt have a Facebook page Clooney smilingly answered ""Id rather have a prostate exam on live TV by a guy with very cold hands."" (See a photo essay on the 65th Venice Film Festival.) There shouldnt be that many paying customers for Goats which opens commercially Nov. 6. Its based on Jon Ronsons book about the U.S. militarys secret ""remote viewing"" missions in which soldiers were trained as ""psychic spies."" With the proper concentration and intuition men could run through walls or as one GI explains ""kill animals just by staring at them."" Clooney plays Lyn Cassady a vaunted veteran of the program whos trying to harness his superpowers for the allied superpowers in the early days of the Iraq adventure. His student and dupe is Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) a naive journalist trying to get a scoop for his Midwestern newspaper. Cassady tells him of the time he used an ancient Chinese maneuver the Death Touch on an adversary. And was the man killed instantly? ""No he died eight years later. Thats the thing about the Death Touch -- you never know when itll take effect."" Is this fact or fantasy? At the beginning of the film we are told ""More of this is true than you would believe."" And as a military device remote viewing is surely no wackier than detecting weapons of mass destruction in a country that didnt have any. But as written by Peter Straughan (who also connived in the movie botch of the nonfiction book How to Lose Friends amp; Alienate People) and directed by Grant Heslov (screenwriter on the Clooney-directed Good Night and Good Luck) Goats strains as hard to find a coherent comic craziness as Cassady does to make clouds part with the force of his mind. Over and over the movie smashes into the wall of plausibility its trying to run through. The difference between Clooney in kooky farces like O Brother Where Art Thou? and Goats and Clooney in more realistic movies like the Oceans series and Up in the Air is the intensity of his playing. In the farces he wears his heroic grin with a subversive idiot twist; his steely-eyed certitude reveals just a flick of lunacy. Otherwise Clooney is reasonable understated channeling his charisma without really trying. When he tamps down the movie-star magic and just lets it seep out it glows all the brighter. Thats quite a feat in Up in the Air since his character Ryan Bingham is a management consultant hired by other companies to tell their employees theyre no longer employed. Hes a fire-man; he keeps his job by relieving other people of theirs. And he does so with such ostensible sympathy and sincerity with helpful suggestions on other lines of work that the victims often leave the interview not wanting to give Ryan the Death Touch. Hes a head chopper acting like a grief counselor. Read ""Glitz and Glamour at the Venice Film Festival."" See TIMEs 2009 Holiday Movie Preview.

"Up in the Air High water mark in George Clooneys career | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesUp in the Air High water mark in George Clooneys careerGeorge Clooney has never seemed more vulnerable or more in tune with a role than he does in Up in the Air  a film that will be hard to beat for Best Picture come Oscar time.George Clooneys Ryan Bingham may have met his match with Vera Farmigas equally ambitious Alex.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 4 2009 Starring George Clooney Vera Farmiga Anna Kendrick and Jason Bateman. Directed by Jason Reitman. 110 minutes. At the Varsity. 14A George Clooney has never seemed more vulnerable or more in tune with a role than he does in Up in the Air a film that will be hard to beat for Best Picture come Oscar time.As corporate downsizer Ryan Bingham a high-flying Grim Reaper for recessionary times Clooney enjoys a gold-plated lifestyle hes more than familiar with off-screen.Article Continued BelowBut this isnt the grinning matinee idol of the Oceans 11 movies or countless magazine fronts trading on his looks rather than his talent. Clooney puts flesh and blood into his paradoxical portrayal of Bingham a hitman with a conscience and the story obviously matters to him as much as it does to Canadian-born director Jason Reitman. Together they are asking how America a land of boundless optimism and promise could be reduced to finding more efficient ways to think smaller. When we first meet Bingham all he cares about is his boyish goal of amassing 10 million frequent flyer miles. As he jets across America bloodlessly lowering the boom on unsuspecting employees VIP seats await him and enchanted portals swing open thanks to his charm and a wallet of premium loyalty cards. Where others might see monotonous airports and hotel rooms the purposefully alone Bingham sees freedom from mundanity - and also the two sisters he barely knows. Hovering above the clouds he literally floats through life. Ah but whats the purpose of travel if you never really arrive anywhere? This thoughtfully entertaining film represents a quantum leap for Clooney who has never been better or funnier.But its even more of an achievement for Reitman who hits his stride as a director with his third feature. Thats really saying something considering the first two were the well-received Thank You for Smoking and the Oscar-nominated Juno. He calls this his most personal film yet one hes been thinking of for nearly a decade. As the son of a Hollywood family he is intimately acquainted with life inside a celebrity bubble. But Reitman who also co-wrote the film (with Sheldon Turner) from a novel by Walter Kirn isnt interested in merely satirizing the existence of guys like Bingham. Up in the Air has many amusing moments yet its more drama than comedy. It speaks to the essential hollowness at the core of North American culture where a persons worth is measured in cold financial terms and where guys like Bingham can prosper by sliding in and out of lives just long enough to ruin them. This includes Binghams relationships with women whom he uses as casually as he does his platinum cards. Hes not into marriage or children and he agrees to attend his younger sisters wedding out of a sense of family obligation. He moonlights as a motivational speaker who preaches the joys of unattached living. Bingham may have met his match in two women one he knows casually and the other professionally. Theres Alex (Vera Farmiga perfect) another perpetual road warrior who shares his delight with high-end travel and hotel sex.Then theres Natalie (Twilights Anna Kendrick revealing) a new hire at Binghams Omaha downsizing firm whose last name ""Keener"" says it all. She has a plan to slash the companys travel budget by firing people via Internet chats. Natalies scheme delights Binghams cost-conscious boss (Jason Bateman). But it horrifies Bingham who is starting to realize that his determination to avoid human bonds have left a void in his life you could fly a jumbo jet through.There are echoes of ""Mrs. Robinson"" in Sad Brad Smiths ""Help Yourself"" the wistful tune that surrounds the movie like an aching and anxious heart. Unlike that Simon amp; Garfunkel song of yore though theres no cynicism only sadness in this ode to fearful times ""Theres people everywhere / And though they dont always show it theyre just as scared."" Up in the Air isnt just a candidate for film of the year; its the film of the buyout-and-burnout era.

The tale of an aloof high-flying exec whose millions of frequent-flyer miles cant keep him permanently above the emotional turbulence he seeks to avoid ""Up in the Air"" is a slickly engaging piece of lightweight existentialism highlighted by winning turns from George Clooney and Vera Farmiga. Just as ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""Juno"" did in their own ways Jason Reitmans third film cleverly taps into specific cultural aspects of the contemporary zeitgeist although in a somewhat less comically convulsive manner. Unlike many of the characters onscreen nobody is going to lose any jobs on the basis of their work here as a buoyant commercial flight lies ahead. Clooney has scarcely ever been more magnetic onscreen than he is here as Ryan Bingham a gun-for-hire who specializes in the dirty work some corporate bosses dont like to do themselves firing employees. Hes great at his job expert at suggesting to devastated workers that new horizons in life can now be explored and he loves the lifestyle of spending most of his time in business class seats and upscale hotels; given that at last count hes on the move 322 days per year his modest apartment in Omaha resembles an undecorated motel room. Having adapted Walter Kirns novel with Sheldon Turner Reitman generates much merriment in the way he lays out the particulars of Ryans m.o. Ryan delivers occasional motivation speeches on how you should be able to fit all thats important to you into a backpack and he practices what he preaches by traveling with just one carry-on bag. He receives top-level members-only treatment at airports car rental desks and hotels and picking up a like-minded woman Alex (Farmiga) in a lounge one night impresses her by revealing hes very close to achieving 10 million-mile frequent-flyer status. Even though the central plot doesnt involve Alex her easy-come easy-go relationship with Ryan represents the heart of the movie simply because the rapport between the two characters -- and causally between the actors -- is so terrific. Its not the hardest thing to write a seduction dance but Reitman and the thesps keep the sex and keen sense of play between these two birds of a feather sparking through the entire running time as the two keep working out ways to make their complicated schedules coincide. Theyre simply one of the most fun couples seen onscreen in many a moon. But theres got to be a fly in the ointment a bird in the engine and her name is Natalie (Anna Kendrick) a grad-school know-it-all and high-tech whiz who convinces Ryans boss Craig (Jason Bateman) he can slash expenditures by firing people via video conferencing. Faced with a drastic lifestyle change at best and his own walking papers at worst Ryan is ultimately obliged to accompany the humorless pursed-lips hotshot on a tour to show her how he does it and then attempt the changeover. Reitman peppers the picture with montages of workers reacting to their sudden professional irrelevance; the incomprehension fury bewilderment sense of injustice hopelessness and despair with which these people express themselves is touching honest and true even if it is punched up for rhythmic and sometimes comic impact. These interludes obviously speak to modern times in a particularly pointed way as does the fact that someone as accomplished together and unimpeachable as Ryan could suddenly be perceived as a dinosaur due to a dubious technological advance. The generational divide also gets a workout in the way the film humorously addresses the way the twentysomething Natalie sees the world as opposed to the more seasoned perspectives of Ryan and Alex. Natalie thinks she has it all figured out with career relationship and life path all configured onto a timeline. For his part Ryan believes hes got it all worked out as well and he does as long as he doesnt mind the lack of much human connection not to even mention marriage or family which he scoffs at as not for him. And perhaps theyre not. All the same hes forced into an unanticipated degree of personal engagement when he attends the northern Wisconsin winter wedding of his younger sister Julie (Melanie Lynskey) to regular guy Jim (Danny McBride). Bringing Alex along for fun and just maybe because he feels something special for her Ryan suffers the scorn of older sis Kara (Amy Morton) for having escaped the family ordinariness but also uses his mediating skills to put some difficulties right. But some final twists provoke a Peggy Lee is-that-all-there-is questioning that pretty much come with the territory of spending much of ones life alone. Impeccably groomed and with a ready answer to almost any remark anyone can throw at himClooney owns his role in the way first-rate film stars can so infusing the character with his own persona that everything he does seems natural and right. The timing in the Clooney-Farmiga scenes is like splendid tennis with each player surprising the other with shots but keeping the rally going to breathtaking duration. Kendrick has the difficult task of playing the spoilsport; you cant wait for her comeuppance which is humorous when it does arrive. Complicating the animosity of Ryan and the viewer is the fact that Natalie is actually good at what she does if still in need of life experience which she begins to collect. Batemans role could have used some layering to at least clarify his relationship with Ryan as to whether its personal or strictly professional. Stunning overhead shots of numerous American cities provide sharp transitions as the characters zip around the country although much of the action is played out on interchangeable airport-area locations.
