Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores Movie Review Foreign Affairs The Quiet American is equal parts romantic thriller and moving meditation on the human toll of geopolitical idealism; in Almodovars latest its the men who fall for the strong silent types. By Peter Rainer ShareThis Greene acres Brendan Frasier and Michael Caine are both friends and rivals in fifties Vietnam in The Quiet American.  (Photo Phil Bray) The opening shots of The Quiet American based on the Graham Greene novel and set in Saigon in 1952 establish the mood that will carry throughout the movie. Delicate boats at night appear as though glimpsed through a moist scrim of memory; but in these same waters a body will soon wash up. The body belongs to Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) an American who had been stationed in Vietnam ostensibly to provide medical aid but who in fact was a covert CIA operative. Over these dark images we hear the ruminative voice of Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) a Times of London reporter who tells us that after a season in Vietnam ""you can hardly remember your name or what youre escaping from."" Fowler has the plangent look of someone who is fully inured to loss; the heat and the torpor have brought out a fatalism in him. The only thing that sparks his rheumy eyes is his young mistress Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen) a graceful beauty who seems unperturbed by their vast difference in age. Fowler is supremely detached except for his love for Phuong. Beautifully directed by Phillip Noyce the film which flashes back from those opening sequences is a full experience a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence. At first the world-weary journalist and the newly arrived gung-ho American are fast friends. When Pyle declares his love for Phuong -- and even later on when Pyles real mission in Vietnam is revealed -- an abiding affection still persists between the two men. Fowler is impressed even a bit tickled by Pyles outright wooing of his mistress; and yet when he says that losing her ""will be the beginning of death"" you believe him. Caine in one of his finest performances shows us the desperation beneath Fowlers practiced politeness and cynicism. In the end following a CIA-engineered explosion in Saigon Square that is blamed on the Communists and that kills more than 30 civilians he goes against Pyle. He does so because finally this unbrave noncommittal man must take a stand or he will come apart. But we are made to wonder as does Fowler how much his righteousness has to do with eliminating a rival. The Quiet American has a script by Christopher Hampton and Robert Schenkkan that is much more faithful to Greenes 1955 novel than the 1958 Hollywood version starring Michael Redgrave and Audie Murphy -- a film Greene hated because among other things it made Pyle into an independent operative and thus toned down the books anti-Americanism. Noyces film was reportedly withheld from distribution by Miramax for over a year because after 9/11 its ideological edge was deemed too controversial. Its true that the movie is politically unsettling. But I wonder if the anti-American angle which Noyce reinforces at the end with a montage of newspaper headlines blaring the U.S. escalation of the war isnt a bit of a red herring. What keeps the film from falling into agitprop is precisely its fairness toward characters who in heavier hands might have remained stock villains (or heroes). Even more so than the novel the film is about the dangerousness of someone who like Pyle is essentially an idealist. He symbolizes the American who truly believes his adventurism is for the greater good. Brendan Fraser is a touch too callow in the role but his bounding goodhearted openness has its complexities It gives the miseries Pyle sets in motion a truly troubling resonance. The film suggests that both Pyle and Fowler are idealists; that each needs something in the other man in order to feel fully alive. For Pyle its his friends mistress -- Phuong is a glimmering embodiment of the Vietnamese people he believes he is trying to save. For Fowler Pyle is a guileless beguiler and however much he despises Pyles interventions he stands abashed before the young mans ardor. Pyle saves Fowlers life at one point during an attack on a watchtower and yet Fowler cant return the favor. In the end for him murder is murder -- the explosion in Saigon Square has taught him that -- and the only way to remain human is to take sides. Pedro Almodovars Talk to Her affects some people very deeply while others like me find it high-grade kitsch. The film features male actors far more than females -- something of a novelty for Almodovar -- and yet ultimately it is about that old mainstay the ineffable mysteriousness of women. Benigno (wonderfully played by Javier Camara) is a gentle male nurse who is devoted to his patient Alicia (Leonor Watling) a ballet student he used to spy on before an auto accident left her in an irreversible coma. In the same hospital is Lydia (Rosario Flores) a bullfighter also comatose. She is regularly visited by Marco (Dario Grandinetti) a husky travel-guide author who was involved with her before her accident in the bull ring. The two men so dissimilar on the surface are linked by their vigilance. The most evocative (and funny) idea in the movie is that they get along better with their women than most wide-awake couples get along with each other. They talk to the ladies as if they could still hear and understand and Benigno for one believes in miracles. Almodovar is more playful when hes making movies about women (or transvestites or transsexuals). The men here tend to bring out in him a dull gravitas. The essence of the films story line is a lot creepier than Almodovar allows for; theres something almost fetishistic about the way he savors the immutability of the women. Its as if they had become comatose so that the two men could be soul mates. Ill say this much Its certainly a novel approach to male bonding. James Bond is tortured by the North Koreans and abandoned by his own people in Die Another Day but in every other respect right down to the Aston Martins and Halle Berrys bikini (think Ursula Andress) its the same old Bond. The chief bad guy is the usual crazy billionaire who in this instance has developed some kind of space-borne solar reflector. (Think SMERSH meets Greenpeace.) This series is in its fortieth year; it might be nice to see Bond battle a readily identifiable real-world villain for a change. Theres certainly no shortage.

With Pierce Brosnan Halle Berry Judi Dench Toby Stephens. Directed by Lee Tamahori. Running time 129 mins. Rated PG-13 action violence. 3 1/2 Stars. A darker more savage James Bond shakes and stirs the long-running spy series from its slumber with ""Die Another Day"" a vigorous 20th installment that is as strong on action as it is weak on the interpersonal stuff. If Bond can get a new car for each episode how about some new pickup lines? Pierce Brosnan has grown into the title role and delivers the series most famous utterance - ""Bond James Bond"" - with the precision accuracy of a heat-seeking missile. He is more human here more fallible. And yet hes still indestructible despite gladiatorial combat taken to the extremes only special effects can produce. The supporting cast of characters includes a villain (Rick Yune) with a diamond-pocked face (diamonds are forever yes?) Halle Berry in a mesmerizing ""Dr. No""-style bikini as Bonds able-bodied American counterpart an ice maiden (Rosamund Pike) ripe for the melting and an extra-chilly M (Judi Dench) who demands to know why Bond didnt take his cyanide pill before being captured by the North Koreans. ""Youre of no use to anyone now"" she scolds him before he spends the better part of two hours proving her wrong. You know director Lee Tamahori (""Once Were Warriors"") means business when the opening credits swimming as expected with molten naked silhouettes (and an atrocious techno-pop song by Madonna) are played over scenes of Bond being tortured - dunked in ice water stung by scorpions shackled and left to rot. He cant talk joke or gadget his way out of this one and so begins the movie proper with a 14-month growth of beard from confinement in a North Korean cell. Have no fear. Torture and malnourishment are nothing but spa treatments for our James. All muscle tone and reflexes are intact. After a shave and a rejuvenating romp with Jinx (Berry) he is good as new ready to elude death by a hairs breadth in exotic locales that range from a bioengineering lab in Havana to an ice palace near the top of the world. The most spectacular sequence is the most down to earth a fencing match between Bond and a ""self-publicizing adventure junkie"" (Toby Stephens). As the weapons escalate in sharpness and heft so do the stakes. Even Madonnas typically artificial cameo cant dampen the blood lust and clang of steel as the combatants leap and dash leaving Richter-scale carnage in their wake. The plot overcomplicated as always involves diamonds big weapons double-crossing and a laser-like second sun that can control Earths weather and resources just like in one of the ""Flint"" movies that starred the late James Coburn. For Bond enthusiasts there are in-jokes Berrys hip dagger the ornithology book for which writer Ian Fleming first named his hero. The car this time is an Aston Martin with a Harry Potter-like invisibility cloak and the gadgets are courtesy of Q (John Cleese) whose lab overflows with reminders of Bond movies past. Otherwise its a Bond picture that fits todays video-game virtual-reality extreme-sports mentality. Halles hallmarks notwithstanding the Oscar-winner does not seem to be up to the scripts limp sexual repartee. We can forgive her for being embarrassed by it. But astonishingly Berry does not seem able or willing to tap into the natural power she wields over men even when sheathed in flesh-hugging maroon leather. At a recent screening her mere presence caused the audience to burst into applause - let that force be with you Halle.

The news is worse for us. Theyve given him license to bore. Captured and tortured after surfing into North Korea on a secret mission Pierce Brosnans 007 emerges from prison behind a beard and under a cloud; his own people suspect hes a turncoat. But the movie has been taken prisoner by its own hardware. At best it looks like an overused-car lot what with massively weaponized coupes -- Bonds Aston Martin Vanquish and a villains Jaguar XKR -- vrooming through an Icelandic ice palace or skidding giddily on the ice. Otherwise its a gallery of inspiration-free notions -- a Hovercraft chase a doomsday satellite reminiscent of the vastly superior ""GoldenEye"" a perfunctory parasail jump a crippled jumbo jet that wouldnt pass muster in the model department of Toys ""R"" Us. (The digital effects are remarkably tacky.) Exotic technology has long been a requirement of the Bond formula. Whats new here is a severe deficit of style or even craftsmanship both in the action sequences and what passes for human interludes. Mr. Brosnan gives his all to the flashbang stuff but he gives understandably his some to dialogue scenes of painful foolishness. Halle Berry plays an NSA operative named Jinx. Her finest moment is her first when she emerges from the sea in a bikini-cum-knife-and-sheath thats almost identical to Ursula Andresss marine wardrobe in the first full-fledged Bond film ""Dr. No."" The style deficit hasnt hurt Ms. Berry. She looks lovely and its nice to see James and Jinx as lovers though one of their encounters finds him looking like hed rather have a snooze. But the script still consigns Jinx to hyperactive sidekickery and all too often Lee Tamahoris direction has her standing or running around with not quite enough to do. The cast includes Toby Stephens Rosamund Pike Rick Yune and as Q John Cleese who actually earns his laughs with crisp comic timing. The plot is a swirl of North Korean evil (plus a smidgen of good) diamonds in Iceland genetic finagling in a tropical clinic and of course imminent planetary catastrophe. Oh and Madonna contributes a dumb cameo along with a tinny theme song. ""Die Another Day"" will be a box-office success most likely a huge one. Audiences take a while to recognize a steep downward trend and Bond fans have proved especially loyal. But another dud like this would test that loyaltys limits. James Bonds producers had best mind the store. Talk to Her Pedro Almodovars ""Talk to Her"" (""Hable con Ella"") opens today only in New York; it wont be shown in other U.S. cities until next month. Normally Id hold my review for the wider release but once youve seen this film you want to tell everyone about it right away. ""Talk to Her"" in Spanish with good English subtitles is beautiful (sometimes sublimely so) daring (sometimes outrageously so) seriously crazed and terrifically funny. Most of all its mysterious a movie that speaks clearly of profound things without naming them a serenely confident work of art that seems to flow with flawless logic from some magic spring of quicksilver feelings. The story follows an improbable -- to say the least -- friendship between two men. Marco who is played by Dario Grandinetti writes magazine articles and travel books. Benigno played by Javier Camara works as a nurse in a private clinic. We see them in the opening scene seated next to each other by chance at a dance performance choreographed by Pina Bausch. Though both men are deeply moved by the spectacle only Marco cries and Benigno notices the tears. They dont come to know one another until after the woman Marco loves a bullfighter named Lydia (Rosario Flores) is horribly gored and transported to Benignos clinic in a coma. There Marco finds Benigno caring for another comatose patient Alicia (Leonor Watling) a young ballerina whod been hit by a car. Not just caring for her but talking to her as intimately and spontaneously as any loving husband ever talks to his wife. ""We get along better than most married couples"" Benigno tells Marco matter-of-factly and whos to say hes wrong. My instinct is to tell you what happens next and next and next to unfurl my acquired cornucopia of delights and surprises. Rather than do that and risk spoiling your delight Ill simply say that this very instinct -- this familiar human need to tell stories and thereby to connect with someone else -- is at the heart of the film. And its given a fascinating twist. As we know from our own experience a storyteller always hopes for a response some sort of feedback. Yet thats not an absolute requirement. As Mr. Almodovar shows through the ardent if amazingly aberrant Benigno the act of telling a story can confer its own rewards. Theres food for the feeder in the feeding. In this film about narration the narrative structure is complex leaping back and forth in time and stopping altogether for two breathtaking interludes. The first consists of the great Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso singing a song at a party in a garden. The song is sweet and simple an old chestnut called ""Cucurrucucu Paloma."" Yet the exquisite Veloso version with a cello obligato by Jaques Morelenbaum becomes quite inexplicably the animating spirit of the movie just as much as Jeanne Moreau singing ""Le Tourbillon"" captured the essence of ""Jules and Jim."" (The haunting score is by Mr. Almodovars longtime collaborator Alberto Iglesias.) The other interlude is a silent film within the film; its called ""The Shrinking Lover."" The old silents could tell stories with matchless intensity so the director has created this new one a hilarious exercise in surreal sexuality to tell us without speaking a word what Benigno is really about. At this point in his career Mr. Almodovar is able to write and direct with such a light sure touch that his presence is both all-pervasive and invisible. His characters seem to be living their own lives following their own hidden sometimes dark imperatives. ""Nothing is simple"" says Geraldine Chaplins ballet mistress toward the end and you want to nod your head in bemused agreement. Yet his film illuminates whatever it touches the pain of solitude the power of faith the dire necessity of love. And it does something else thats invaluable at a time when dedicated filmmakers must struggle as never before to bring their work to fruition. ""Talk to Her"" reminds us how original -- and blissfully entertaining -- a movie can be. The Emperors Club ""A mans character is his fate"" Kevin Klines classics professor William Hundert tells his privileged prep-school students in ""The Emperors Club."" And a movies script is its fate which means this one is doomed. Hollywood Journal Emperors Club Faced Tight Budget Conditions 11/08/02 What a frustrating waste of talent starting though not ending with Mr. Kline who always brings verve and rare intelligence to his roles whether they do or dont deserve it. Here hes a pedagogue whose kind though rigorous ways will inevitably recall Mr. Chips as well as John Keating the prep-school teacher played by Robin Williams in ""Dead Poets Society."" Emile Hirsch last seen in ""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" plays Hunderts nemesis Sedgewick Bell a rebellious freshman whose father is a U.S. senator. Mr. Hirsch a strong actor too is at his best when young Sedgewick is at his cocksure willful worst. But the screenplay adapted by Neil Tolkin from a short story by Ethan Canin lacks the integrity that Hundert keeps holding up to his kids as essential to a civilized life. Bent on selling inspiration it turns Sedgewick into an eager scholar with a jolting transformation that takes place off screen. (And a complicated transformation whose ramifications are explored only after Sedgewick has grown into adulthood when hes suddenly played by an older actor we dont give a damn about.) The script also lacks connective tissue; its a succession of discrete scenes without resonance. Though the movie has worthy things to say about cheating and moral leadership it cant find a consistent or convincing voice. Like its gallant conflicted hero ""The Emperors Club"" is old-school but stiff and clumsy to boot.    VIDEO TIP No one surfs into North Korea in ""The 39 Steps"" but this sophisticated spy melodrama -- Alfred Hitchcocks 1935 original not the remakes -- still gives pleasure along with some thrills. Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll play the man and woman handcuffed to each other until they fall in love.

Share Tweet Since at least the first decade of the James Bond series the scene in which Bond visits the gadgetmaster Q pretty much sums up the film. If for instance Q grudgingly grants him a pair of bullet-spewing tap shoes its a pretty good bet that later Bond will find a way to tap himself out of danger. But the films adherence to a predictable formula is less important than individual installments efforts to live up to that formula. These days no one comes to James Bond for surprises and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are understandably reluctant to provide them. The last time they got adventurous making Bond into a rogue agent in 1989s License To Kill it sent the franchise into a six-year hiatus. A little formula-bending might do the series some good however as evidenced by the first hour of Die Another Day. The pre-credits action sequence ends not with a daring escape but with the heros capture. As the usual naked shadows dance over the credits current Bond Pierce Brosnan is beaten by North Koreans to the tune of Madonnas eerie title song then emerges bearded and bedraggled above a subtitle that reveals the passage of 14 months. Discredited and disgraced in the eyes of boss M (Judi Dench) Brosnan subsequently struggles against a surgically altered assassin (Rick Yune) and a malevolent billionaire (Toby Stephens) in a conflict that takes on the tone of a personal vendetta. Its just new enough to keep the film fresh like the skittish beats composer David Arnold brings to the familiar music. That makes it more of a letdown than usual when the formula finally kicks in with ritualistic predictability but at least it still promises elaborate lairs high-speed chases women in impractical evening wear and explosions aplenty. Halle Berrys much-touted role as a secret agent proves only slightly meaty but at least she makes a more convincing female Bond than Barbara Bach in The Spy Who Loved Me. Brosnan still fills the role nicely but initial grit aside Die does little to rescue his reputation as a caretaker Bond. Sean Connery gave James Bond a steely cool Roger Moore a goofy wit and Timothy Dalton a suppressed torment but Brosnans contribution other than a quiet assurance and an iconic appearance remains unclear. Like Michael Apteds The World Is Not Enough (the best of the Brosnan Bonds so far) Die enlisted a real director in this case Lee Tamahori. But that seems to make little difference particularly once the action takes over. Most worrisome of all that action needs to be more commanding The many shots of characters operating devices with remote controls will do little to quiet the complaints that the films have started to resemble video games and the same can be said of the proliferating digital effects. Where everything is possible little can be startling and Bond remains most appealing when hes not that much larger than life. By the end of Die Another Day the characters potential to wind up beaten and broken has vanished amid the pixels and laser beams.

Not that theres anything wrong with Pierce Brosnan. After four films as James Bond the role fits him like a perfectly tailored tuxedo. But to keep up with younger hipper imitations ""Die Another Perhaps its time to say goodbye to Mr. Bond. Not that theres anything wrong with Pierce Brosnan. After four films as James Bond the role fits him like a perfectly tailored tuxedo. But to keep up with younger hipper imitations ""Die Another Day"" - the 20th installment of the spy franchise - is about crashes rather than character development explosions over exposition. The double entendres clang like feeble frat-party flirtations. And references to gadgets and plot lines from Bond films past intended as loving homage on the series 40th anniversary only make us long to be shaken and stirred like we were watching the Sean Connery films from the 1960s. As the latest Bond girl an American agent named Jinx Halle Berry emerges gloriously from the ocean just as Ursula Andress did in the first movie ""Dr. No."" (She even wears a bikini similar to Andress with a knife sheath on her hip.) Jinx is tied down and tortured with a laser like Connerys Bond was in ""Goldfinger."" Later she endures a claustrophobic near-drowning similar to Denise Richards fate in ""The World Is Not Enough."" And the plot has glimmers of ""Diamonds Are Forever"" with a villain stocking up on diamonds to pay for a deadly laser satellite. By now it would be hard for a new Bond film not to refer to an earlier one; the franchise has been parodied (in the ""Austin Powers"" movies) and reinvigorated (in the summer blockbuster ""XXX"") so many times theres nothing original left. Here when Bond snowboards down a mountain trying to escape an avalanche its reminiscent of a stunt Vin Diesel pulled in ""XXX"" - itself a rip-off of Roger Moores daring skiing chase in ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" That avalanche scene by the way brings us to another problem with this newfangled Bond It relies too heavily on fake-looking computer-generated effects. The best scene in the movie features a beautifully choreographed fencing duel between Bond and Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens Maggie Smiths son) a pretty-boy adventurer and megalomaniac who announces from his frozen palace in Iceland that hes created a second sun which he calls Icarus. Based on that name you know something has to fly too close to the device and burn its wings. That something would be a jumbo jet which Jinx tries to prevent from crashing - when shes not engaged in a duel of her own with Graves right-hand woman Miranda Frost (a Grace Kellyesque newcomer Rosamund Pike) while Bond and Graves duke it out in another section of the plane. OK you have to walk into a James Bond movie expecting a certain level of improbability - hes never functioned in reality and thats much of the allure. But director Lee Tamahoris action sequences are bombastic in the beginning and grow increasingly ridiculous to the point where youre laughing out loud instead of oohing and ahhing. And just when you think thats the climax the movie has to go back to North Korea where Bond was imprisoned in the beginning to blow up all the remaining land mines. Beavis and Butt-head would have loved this movie. Explosions Chicks Heh heh-heh. Who wouldnt get excited over Berry though? Shes strong and sexy a great match for the dashing Brosnan - so much so that MGM already is planning a film based on her character which has never happened before with a Bond girl. Shes more than that though; shes his partner and every bit his equal. The movie also gives Madonna the chance to redeem herself after the disastrous ""Swept Away."" She performs the electronica-heavy theme song and makes an unbilled cameo as a fencing instructor; dressed in a black leather corset left over from her ""Erotica"" days she quips to Bond ""I see you handle your weapon well."" At least Madonna will appear in one successful movie this year - for no matter what critics say Bond will survive another day at the box office. ""Die Another Day"" an MGM release runs 130 minutes. Two stars out of four.

Comments Die Another Day Maybe Ive seen too many James Bond movies by now or maybe the trouble with this 20th installment is that the filmmakers are trying too hard to top the excesses of the predecessors. I suppose that the baroque North Korean villains here might serve to inspire enlistments for a theoretical World War IV assuming that were still around to enjoy such a caper. And I guess that if you can manage to overlook how much Pierce Brosnan is beginning to resemble Fred MacMurray you might find this 007 romp more neat than ridiculous. The problem for me is that the story is so entirely at the service of the special effects. I like Halle Berry a lot but neither she nor the other deadly sex object Rosamund Pike seems to be having much fun. With Judi Dench Toby Stephens Michael Madsen and John Cleese. 123 min.

"Die Another Day thrilled me then betrayed me in the end. Slate Sign In Sign Up Die Another Day thrilled me then betrayed me in the end. Die Another Day thrilled me then betrayed me in the end. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 21 2002 538 PM The Spy Who Went Into the Cold He thrilled me then betrayed me in the end. By David Edelstein Pierce Brosnan digging the Bond legacy For three-quarters of its running time Die Another Day (MGM) is bracingly true to its title It keeps the James Bond franchise which has often seemed in need of last rites alive to rake in billions. The challenge for 007 writers and directors is always to find a middle ground between the habitual and the fresh. Its only the familiar Pavlovian triggers (beginning with the roving-gunsight prelude and Monty Normans brassy secret-agent theme) that have kept viewers salivating through all the overproduced under-plotted travelogues. But its only the brutally unexpected that keeps Bond from edging into camp. Advertisement That this Bond will be smarter is clear from its title sequence which leaves you both shaken and stirred. Its not just a montage of the usual leggy silhouettes straddling long gun barrels Its also a stylized torture sequence following Bonds capture by our ""Axis of Evil"" friends the North Koreans. The wriggling silhouettes are of women but also of scorpions as theyre held against Bonds skin. Madonnas vocal on the techno-whoosh title track has a metallic jitter For a change the singer sounds expressively inexpressive with an eerie lack of pity. When Judi Denchs M encounters Bond after his grueling 18-month imprisonment she hardly showers him with kisses. She seems vexed that he survived. A coldness of tone marked the best Bonds (especially the first three) and that chill suffuses Die Another Day Its most spectacular set is an Icelandic ice palace; and its most frightening baddie a North Korean assassin named Zao (Rick Yune) has white diamonds embedded in his hard hairless face from an explosive act of Bond-age. The New Zealand-born director Lee Tamahori made the shocking Once Were Warriors (1994) a study in working-class Maori squalor alcoholism and abuse of women. He brings a dash more realism than usual--and in Bond you dont want more than a dash. There are plenty of laughs and in-jokes but they dont throw you out of the movie--well they do but irony is built into Bond movies so youre always in and out of them anyway laughing at their flagrant mega-budget excesses. This one laughs with you and then when it jolts you with unanticipated sadism at you. Theres even an oblique reference to 9/11--during which Bond was apparently shackled in that North Korean prison (or the World Trade Center would presumably still be standing). The top villain sneers that he was schooled in ""Western hypocrisy"" at Oxford and Harvard; and the audience is meant to feel quiet fury at hearing such Noam-Chomskyesque righteousness from the mouth of a fascist. This psychotic martinet makes fun of the British for believing they still have ""the right to police the world""--and we cant let him get away with that can we? When a fugitive Bond--bedraggled bearded sans shoes and wallet--strolls into the lobby of a plush Hong Kong hotel and nonchalantly asks for his usual suite his tailor some food and a 61 Bollinger more than comfort is at stake. Bond is an underdog now and his natural white Anglo-Saxon male privilege must be restored. Which doesnt rule out miscegenation. Die Another Day will also be known as the Halle Berry Bond picture--the first with a Bond girl who has an Oscar under her belt and the first with a major African-American squeeze. (I know Bond slept with the much blacker Grace Jones in A View to a Kill [1985] but she was a villain.) You cant call the movie progressive since the emphasis in the action climax--which features two gorgeous women in very tight tank tops having at each other with swords--is on the very tight tank tops not the swords. And Berry isnt even especially good. Her banter is unusually cringe-worthy and her voice is toneless. But her mocha-latte skin tones leap out of the blue-white screen. And she seems very soulful indeed beside the other Bond girl--a steely publicist called Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) who brings a chill irony to her inevitable coupling with 007. Pierce Brosnan gets better and better. He injects a tiny bit of drama into the role--a tension between the classic persona with its easy sense of entitlement and an anxious awareness that its no longer as easy as all that. He has to work for his triumphs. Hes also the first Bond (other than George Lazenby) who doesnt look embarrassed to be there He digs the legacy. Apart from that Hong Kong hotel scene his best moments are with the new Q (John Cleese in better--less broad--form than last time) who walks him past gizmos from many of the other 007 movies the jet-pack from Thunderball (1965) the ejector-seat from Goldfinger (1964). Brosnan fingers them with a gratifying affection. Die Another Day hits peak after peak in North Korea; in Hong Kong; in Cuba (actually Spain but convincing) with the great Emilio Echevarria as a crime boss/cigar-maker; in London where Bond first crosses blades (literally) with the snooty uber-villain (Toby Stephens son of Maggie Smith and the late Robert Stephens) in a furiously over-the-top swordfight. You know a director is in control when one of a  movies highlights is a low-key exchange with Madonna who plays--very well--a tart fencing instructor. I was busily scribbling things like ""The best Bond since The Spy Who LovedMe"" when 90 minutes in Bond surfs an Icelandic tidal wave. These computer-generated effects look like the worst of Spider-Man wedded to the worst of a Frankie-and-Annette beach-party movie. Then theres an interminable eardrum-buckling car chase through the ice palace and a lousy comeuppance for Yunes Zao--who deserved something brutal but elegantly simple like Oddjobs fate in Goldfinger. After an hour and a half of thinking the filmmakers wit might be commensurate with their wallet its depressing to see them suddenly throwing around their money like smug little trust-funders. Thats like so Roger Moore. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

But the movie loses steam and the sequences that dazzled in the beginning get overshadowed by the excesses of later scenes. The opener a spectacular surfing scene that leads up to a breathtaking hovercraft chase over land mines in North Korea delivers the kind of action one goes to Bond movies for. The initial credits are classic Bond -- a visual delight to the accompaniment of Madonnas title song -- and they also manage to cover what could have been tedious exposition in a compelling way artfully telescoping several months in which Bond is in solitary confinement in a Korean prison. Review of the movie Die Another Day (out of four) Stars Pierce Brosnan Halle Berry Toby Shields Judi Dench Director Lee Tamahori Distributor MGM Rating PG-13 for action violence and sexuality However the film is so fraught with explosions and chases that the action eventually feels numbing. Die Another Day may have achieved the dubious distinction of detonating more explosions than any other movie this year. As Agent 007 Pierce Brosnan searches from Korea to Hong Kong to London to Cuba (actually filmed in Cadiz Spain) to Iceland for a man who double-crossed him. Brosnan is ever suave and dashing in his fourth effort as Bond. Even after 14 months in prison emerging scruffy and unkempt he has a dignity and elan about him. Still one does breathe a sigh of relief once hes back in his customary elegant suits. And although he still charms the ladies he does seem to be winnowing the numbers down a bit. He has a brief fling with the chilly Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) and a more intense passion with Jinx (Halle Berry). Berrys sleek beauty is well-suited to the role. Her first appearance coming out of the ocean in a bikini is a nod to Ursula Andress in 1962s Dr. No. Berry sensuously strikes sparks with Brosnans Bond. If anyone will ever break his heart it looks to be Jinx who is nearly Bonds match in most categories athletic prowess grace under fire and cocky assurance. The pair do some powerfully suggestive verbal jousting proving shes almost his equal in the steamy double-entendre department. Bond still flippantly delivers the lions share of corny bon mots dashed off effortlessly while dispatching villains. Speaking of effort this 20th Bond film almost exerts too much. Perhaps no Bond movie or any other action film of its ilk should ever exceed two hours. Most would be better served coming in closer to 90 minutes if the excitement is to be sustained. At a running time of 2 hours 10 minutes Die Another Day seems to last into another day.

Directed by Lee Tamahori from a screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. 122 minutes. Rated PG-13 for action violence and sexuality. Several theaters. The new James Bond movie reveals what may well be a universal truth (at least since Sean Connery hung up his tuxedo) -- in general Bond movies are far more cool to think about than to actually watch. Despite the best efforts of Pierce Brosnan a man so devilishly handsome he really should come with a warning label and the gorgeous Halle Berry ""Die Another Day"" never quite finds real excitement or genuine wit. Perhaps what the now 40-year-old franchise needs is a more energetic hip directorial hand -- someone like Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") or Sam Raimi (""Spider-Man""). Lee Tamahori (""Along Came a Spider"") seems too weighed down by the heft of Bond history or by the longtime Bond producers. He strings together action sequences in the expected variety of exotic locations but it mostly feels tired and anachronistic rather than charmingly retro. Even Berrys first appearance as she emerges from the sea in homage to Ursula Andress Venus-like arrival in ""Dr. No"" lacks a certain something. Its not Berrys fault -- she looks terrific despite having been forced to accessorize her bikini with a white hip belt -- that the moment seems random. Are there dozens of Halle Berry-like goddesses wading to shore on this particular beach and Bond just happens to glance up from his drink and see this one? Nonetheless the Brosnan/Berry combination is a heady one -- the two of them are such flawless specimens that the screen practically combusts when theyre together what with all those perfect teeth and bedroom eyes. And both mercifully have a light touch with the trademark heavy-as-lead Bond dialogue. Berry plays Jinx (""born on Friday the 13th"") an American spy who teams with Bond against evil megalomaniac Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) and his equally nasty sidekick Zao (Rick Yune). The plot involves a new high-tech catastrophic weapon stolen diamonds a mysterious gene-therapy clinic that looks like a 70s disco and North Korea/South Korea tensions but none of this really matters much. More to the point nifty cars are driven cool chases unfold over mud (via hovercraft like a big bumper-car rally) and ice martinis are consumed and PG-13 Bond sex happens. ""Die Another Day"" has its moments Samantha Bond has a charming scene as the ever-thwarted Miss Moneypenny; John Cleese (replacing longtime gadgetmaster Desmond Llewlyn who died in 1999) has some too-brief funny banter with Bond. ""Youre cleverer than you look"" says Brosnan. ""Its better than looking cleverer than you are"" shoots back Cleese. And Madonna as a dominatrix-like fencing instructor acquits herself nicely in a brief glamorous cameo. So theres fun to be had here even if some of the action sequences seem like too much CGI and too little peril and even if the weirdly hallucinogenic opening credit sequence features an imprisoned Brosnan being tortured. (This by the way is supposed to be the new fresh idea behind this movie -- that Bond arrested and stripped of his credentials is operating outside the system -- but really it doesnt make much difference at all except that we briefly have to endure seeing him unshaven.) For Bond 21 -- keep Brosnan keep Berry and find a new director/screenwriting team capable of combining action with wit and style. Or just re-release ""Goldfinger"" and leave it at that.

Starring Pierce Brosnan Halle Berry Rosamund Pike and Toby Stephens. Directed by Lee Tamahori. (PG-13. 132 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For those of us who enjoy James Bond movies (everybody?) ""Die Another Day"" has just enough juice to keep the romance going a commanding Commander Bond (Pierce Brosnan) a pair of decorative Bond women (he gets two nowadays) and some imaginative gadgetry including a disappearing car. But the new movie lacks something a special something. Its a quality that has characterized some of the best of the first 19 Bond movies extravagant ludicrousness. Or is it a buoyancy? Or a carelessness? Or a smirky heartlessness? The phrase is hard to find but we know a James Bond atmosphere when we see one and in ""Die Another Day"" its there only intermittently. Film exactly the same movie without English accents and it would be hard to identify it as a Bond movie. The temptation is to blame Madonna -- she does sing the title song doesnt she? And she does appear in a single scene as a fencing instructor. But no this time shes innocent. Maybe the whole thing gets off on the wrong foot in the beginning Bond is captured by North Korean terrorists and tortured for 14 months during which time he begins to resemble Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away."" Its impossible to come off as debonair and glib while looking like one of the Apostles. Once hes released Bond is suspected of having talked his head off while in prison (of course he didnt). He becomes a man alone stripped of his secret agent ranking on a mission to clear his good name by tracking down a terrorist named Zao (Rick Yune). This time its personal but the thing is with Bond its usually better when its not personal. Earnestness softens and humanizes him while making the violence seem real -- not cartoony -- and thus nasty and even repellent. So Bond is on a search. Early in the film the search takes him to Havana where he meets an American mystery woman Jinx played by Halle Berry. Berry emerges from the surf beautiful in a peach-colored bikini and is soon subjected to one of the most tacky pickup scenes of the year. The abysmal dialogue -- some nonsense about predators and prey -- makes Bond seem like a middle-aged creep and smoking a cigar no less. Actually all the double entendres in ""Die Another Day"" are cringe-inducing. Even when Bond looks suave he talks silly. The one virtue of Neal Purvis and Robert Wades script (they wrote the excellent ""The World Is Not Enough"") is its zaniness. There are mad DNA experiments a palace made of ice (in Iceland) and a satellite laser weapon that can gobble up and spit out nuclear warheads. Theres also a fatuous British villain a young billionaire fencing master played by Toby Stephens who has a face even Gandhi would have loved to smack. But director Lee Tamahori (""Mulholland Falls"") blows it by literalizing everything dragging the performances and the movies look down to a pedestrian realism. Theres no glossiness to this Bond entry. The movie looks more like Tamahoris ""The Edge"" (a gritty outdoor film with Anthony Hopkins). This literalness makes some of the silliness impossible to enjoy. For example when Bond devises a makeshift snowboard and glides just feet ahead of a killer laser theres the uneasy sense that Tamahori is taking this seriously trying to pass off an absurd situation (and cheesy effects) as the real deal. Fortunately a director has to work really hard to kill a Bond movie and Tamahori doesnt work that hard. I doubt Im alone in my tendency to give any sequence the benefit of the doubt when it has the Bond theme playing underneath it. ""Die Another Day"" has plenty of those plus John Cleese as Q acting Basil Fawlty-like in his dislike of Bond. And then theres Judi Dench who brings the gravity of a disappointed mother to her scenes with Brosnan. Berry deflects the indignity of Bond-girl status as if by resolving to be cheerful while Rosamund Pike as the other Bond girl shines bringing a cool implacability to what at least here passes for an interesting character a fencing teacher/publicist/secret agent. These good points make the movie easy to sit through but recommending it is another story. Still even if fans are disappointed by ""Die Another Day"" they probably wont really regret having seen it. -- This film contains graphic violence and sexual interludes.

"Try Another Way - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Bond Try Another WayMovies - REVIEW - Die Another DayThe Enemy In Die Another Day? Its Deja Vu. This Bond Has Been There Done That All Before.November 22 2002|By Roger Moore Sentinel Staff WriterForty years and 20 (official) films into the run James Bonds bag of tricks is pretty much empty. Madonna can sing ""Im gonna avoid the cliche"" in the techno title tune. Fat chance. Its all variations on a weary theme as Die Another Day the latest and least of the Pierce Brosnan Bonds proves.In a lot of ways Die Another Day is a return to Bonds bad-old-days the early 1980s when the plots were outlandish and haphazard the stunts were fake and the whole enterprise was being treated as a cartoon.That isnt what was intended. They were shooting for a goofy 40th anniversary tribute to Bonds storied past. There are gadgets from a dozen Bond films jokingly referenced in a tour of Q Department with the droll John Cleese officially taking over for the late Desmond Llewellyn. The jet-pack from Thunderball the knife-armed shoe of From Russia With Love are just a few of the props Cleese walks Bond past as he acidly suggests that since he is giving him his 20th gadget watch ""You might try to bring this one back.""Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (The World Is Not Enough) are nothing if not recyclers. They bring back the bikini from Dr. No the laser-murder gag and armed-to-the-teeth Aston Martin from Gold- finger the diamond-studded killer satellite and plastic surgery clinic -- a DNA disco this time -- of Diamonds Are Forever the villains lair from The Spy Who Loved Me this time made of ice.And they begin the film by limply remaking the arms bazaar opening gambit -- the action sequence before the credits -- of Tomorrow Never Dies.Brosnan-Bond is captured by the North Koreans who torture him for 14 months or all the way through the macabre opening credits whichever seems longer. He has been sold out and when hes released -- looking very much the way Brosnan did in his Robinson Crusoe -- all he wants is revenge.""While you were away the world changed"" M (Judi Dench) tells him. Bond isnt biting. And when he is given the keys to a new way cool stealth Aston Martin to drive as he traces the diamonds behind North Koreas adventurism everything old is new again.His co-equal in this pursuit is the American agent Jinx played by Halle Berry who wears an orange version of the Ursula Andress bikini of Dr. No. Shes easy on the eyes and good in a clinch but its a badly underwritten role.The bad guy is an attention-hound diamond billionaire played by Toby Stephens in a slippery Edward VIII impersonation. He and his henchman diamond-faced Rick Yune send Bond and Jinx to exotic Iceland where they fight and chase and race on the ice to keep North Korea from starting World War III.New Zealand director Lee Tamahori of Once Were Warriors Mulholland Falls and The Edge uses grim moments of torture flashy editing and a pretty hot sex scene as his Bond calling cards. But Tamahori truth be told hasnt made a good movie since leaving New Zealand.Tamahori manages to jolt up the action giving the chases a terrific swordfight and assorted brawls and gun-battles a shot of adrenaline. But the only other stamp he puts on the film is shoving New Zealand Maori-native actors into bit parts in too many scenes to count. Theres no tension he loses track of the villains and like legions of directors before him he fails to make Madonna convincing in a bit part as a fencing instructor.Every actor who has played Bond save George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton has stuck around one or two films too long in the role. Brosnan still invests something of himself in the part. From his first Bond he has run fought and wise-cracked as if his life and the world depended on him. But weak dialogue and sloppy editing make both him and Berry look like bad actors in their scenes together.But at some point every Bond takes his eye off the ball and allows himself to do bad scripts and just throws up his hands and lets the filmmakers shove him into fake-looking rear-projection stunts -- surfing snowboarding fights on moving hovercraft. Thats a good sign the jig is up.Brosnan just signed up for yet another Bond. As maybe the best at playing that role ever he has a slim chance of redeeming the series again. Will he? Never say never.

After 40 years 007 shows no shortness of breath and after an endless array of violent explosive and superhuman clashes with death he still emerges with one Band-Aid and an undiminished sexual appetite. Talk about longevity The world blows up in 20 time zones over a period of 40 years and 007 just gets younger and more virile every time. Die Another Day is the most thrilling lavishly designed and imaginative Bond picture in years. It is also the most preposterous. Does anybody care? If youre a fan youve learned by now that the last thing to expect from one of these things is narrative coherence. So suspend your disbelief watch the heroics laugh at the invisible cars and jet-propelled snowmobiles treat the whole experience like a day off with popcorn and a good time is guaranteed. I can no longer tell one Bond movie from another and I couldnt relate one of the plots at gunpoint. But although Die Another Day defies description I admit it kept me awake and amused for a running time of two hours and 15 minutes and thats more than I can say for most of the other films Ive seen in the pre-Christmas countdown. Pierce Brosnan the suavest secret agent since Sean Connery is back in Brioni tuxes and satin sheets crunching bones and firing missiles with his tongue planted firmly in his handsome cheek. In the spectacular opening sequence he surfboards onto the beaches of North Korea on colossal waves tracks down a villainous colonel who is buying a fleet of high-tech atomic weapons with a fortune in diamonds in order to finance a war that threatens to destroy the world blows up the demilitarized zone and blasts his way through a minefield-all before the opening credits even begin Imprisoned and tortured with injections of scorpion poison for 14 months he finds himself traded by Her Majestys government for Zao the worst terrorist in North Korea and placed in detention under the stern watchful eye of his old boss M (Dame Judi Dench trying to make the most of dialogue even she doesnt understand). But Bond escapes checks into the swankiest hotel in Hong Kong in wet pajamas and orders a bottle of 61 Bollinger. What would you do? Next stop Havana with its 58 Chevys Cuban cigars and the treacherous Zao (Rick Yune) a Korean killer with blue eyes and diamonds imbedded in his skin like sparkling acne. Enter a brand-new high-octane Bond girl named Jinx played by a scantily clad Halle Berry who emerges from the sea with a knife holster in her bikini a not-so-subtle hommage to Ursula Andress. The aptly named Jinx and the oversexed Bond become sidekicks in and out of bed exchanging body fluids and bad jokes before they blow up the Cuban clinic where Zao is hiding out waiting to have his identity changed through DNA splicing. Back in London M holds secret meetings in an abandoned subway station while Q the high-tech-gadget guru now played by John Cleese introduces new toys like a gold ring that demolishes glass walls and fondly revisits old artifacts like the exploding backpacks from Thunderball and Lotte Lenyas knife-throwing shoes in From Russia with Love . While in London Bond visits a gentlemans club in Mayfair run by-are you ready?-none other than Madonna (in an unbilled cameo). Enter another Bond kitten a cool double agent named Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) and the cunningly evil new villain Gustav Graves (dashingly played by Toby Stephens the son of Dame Maggie Smith) an arrogant eco-friendly diamond miner from Iceland whose true secret identity has been resculpted through Cuban gene therapy into that of a British fencing champion. Are you still with me? Everyone ends up on an Icelandic glacier in the films outrageous centerpiece an igloo-shaped luxury hotel made entirely of ice where the spectacular sets melt before your eyes Jinx is trapped under an iceberg Bond flies to the rescue in an invisible Aston Martin that launches torpedoes from the mufflers in time to thaw her out (boy does he thaw her out) and ... oh what the hell. You get the picture. This is supposed to be a 007 for the new millennium (replete with a lousy theme song by Madonna) but the dialogue seems mysteriously retro (""I see Mr. Bonds been explaining his Big Bang theory."" ""Oh yes I think I get the thrust of it"")-and I may be wrong but I think Ive seen some of the gadgets at Sharper Image. Still there is much to enjoy here. The direction by New Zealands Lee Tamahori makes every frame count. No matter how sharply the movie careens in the direction of absurdity he makes sure theres no time to scratch your head or mutter ""Huh?"" And although Mr. Brosnan and Ms. Berry are often upstaged by the technology dangerous stunts and special effects theyre as easy on the eyes as they are indestructible. The technicians outnumber the actors 100 to 1 but when its over and your pulse rate returns to normal its still the dynamic and sexy new Bond team that lodges Die Another Day in the memory bank. Love and War in Colonial Vietnam The Quiet American is one of those cold cryptic Graham Greene espionage thrillers about sex and politics that somebody always has to explain to me later. This one is slower than the buzz of a mosquito but moody and brilliantly evocative of a time place and people in transition. Without tricks and pyrotechnics Phillip Noyce the Australian director of such high-octane thrillers as Patriot Games  Clear and Present Danger and The Bone Collector  turns cerebral exploring the visceral intrigues-both personal and political-between two men caught up in the French war in Indochina in the early 50s. Michael Caine plays Thomas Fowler a lazy correspondent for The Times of London who has settled into a life of sensual hedonism in Saigon with his stunning young Vietnamese mistress Phuong (played by lovely newcomer Do Thi Hai Yen). Fowler has abandoned a wife back in London who refuses to grant him a divorce while Phuong wants nothing more than marriage and respectability. For a time theyre both willing to coast along enjoying the luxuries of colonialism. Ignoring the smoke signals of an approaching war thats slowly encroaching on his lifestyle Fowler is on the verge of being sent home to London by his newspaper because hes only filed three stories in a year. But everything changes with the arrival of a bespectacled idealistic young doctor from Boston named Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) whose curiosity about the conflicts between the French and the Communists arouses Fowlers suspicions. When Pyle falls in love with Phuong panic and jealousy are added to an already poisonous brew. At first Pyle seems irritating but harmless-a naive decent and foolish do-gooder who just wants to help the Vietnamese in their struggle for independence. Then Fowler discovers that ""the quiet American"" is a secret operative working for the C.I.A. whose interference leads to the massacre of innocent civilians. With Ho Chi Minh dividing the country and 495000 American troops on their way to fight a full-scale war the old emotionally detached journalist sees the opportunity to orchestrate a ""scoop"" of international impact that will extend his stay in Saigon and springs into an act of deception and betrayal that leads to murder. In the tragic consequences a moral question remains Has the sleeping tiger eliminated his nemesis because his long-dormant conscience is at last awakened or because the ""quiet American"" has stolen his girl? Working from a tight adaptation by Christopher Hampton and Robert Schenkkan of the classic Greene story Mr. Noyce builds an existential portrait of conflicted souls with hidden agendas in which nothing is as it seems. The smell heat rain lights on the Mekong River at night opium and brothels-every surface appearance is deceptive and every sensual pleasure is pierced by an undercurrent of violence. The fact that there are no heroes in this film enhances its integrity but also challenges its potential for commercial success. In the newly forged national patriotism following 9/11 do audiences really want to see a movie that depicts the American military as savage mercenaries? Despite the obvious bad timing The Quiet American is highly recommended viewing for its courage ideas technical proficiency and great acting. Mr. Caines performance is one of the highlights of an undeniably distinguished career. From sloth to centaur the gradations of his metamorphosis are reflected in reptilian eyes that take in every shadowy movement of every scene hes in. Mr. Frasers transformation from smooth clean-cut egghead to lethal provocateur matches the old veteran all the way. Moving from brainless frolics like George of the Jungle to sensitive challenges like Gods and Monsters  Mr. Frasers career trajectory is clearly defined by diversification. His superb portrayal of Pyle is a gripping study of contrasts. And there is the power of the story itself Few films deal with Americas evil prewar involvement in the region which led to the shameful conflict that torched Vietnam. A complex love story of competing desires and paradoxical priorities set against a tapestry of shady maneuvers for power The Quiet American digs deeply into the human condition. Color it fascinating. Emperors Club Still Stands Out Back in September when I wrote about The Emperors Club from the Toronto Film Festival I called it one of the best American films of the year. I havent changed my mind. After watching the recent disturbing 60 Minutes piece about the spiraling statistics on college cheating and the rising number of Web sites selling test answers and term papers this valuable insightful film seems twice as relevant. Sensitively written meticulously directed (by the excellent Michael Hoffman) gorgeously photographed and beautifully acted this profound and deeply moving film stars the great Kevin Kline as a dedicated teacher at a distinguished prep school who believes that ""a mans history is his fate."" A noble inspired academic in charge of a classful of scrubbed and respectful students eager to learn his world is disrupted by the arrival of a rich arrogant spoiled brat named Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch). Bell has been taught by his father a Virginia Senator that the fastest way to power and success is to lie and cheat your way to the top. Eschewing Roman history for girlie mags cigarettes and rule-breaking Bell becomes a dangerous role model for the other boys and a challenge to the professors deep-rooted integrity. Rebelliously resisting the passage from juvenile anarchy to manhood the boy is caught cheating on the annual contest for membership in the esteemed ""Emperors Club"" and goes down in the professors personal history as his greatest career failure. Twenty-five years later the same kid-now a wealthy corporate C.E.O. running for political office-pledges the largest donation in the schools history on the condition that the contest be restaged on his luxury country estate with all of the old contestants and the retired professor as the judge. Instead of regaining his lost honor the handsome grown-up Bell (Joel Gretsch a matinee idol in the making) cheats again in front of the old classmates who are now power players in the fields of industry law finance and education. History repeats itself as the world of principles and virtues collides with the popular trend toward expeditious lying and cheating weve all witnessed in the Enron and WorldCom scandals. Much more than just another Dead Poets Society  this is a film of enormous heart compassion and intelligence that tackles vital issues with wrenching thought-provoking honesty and cinematic skill. I really love everything it stands for. There will be bigger noisier and flashier movies this year but I havent seen anything that has impressed me more.

This time Halle Berry fresh from her Oscar win for Monsters Ball would give British spy James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) a worthy female counterpart. This time a betrayed Bond would be forced to dramatically reclaim his reputation -- and of course save the world. This time for the series 40th anniversary loving nods would be made to Bond movies past. That at least occurs. But this time like so many times since the films fixated on over-the-top action the new film Die Another Day disappoints. Sure its got guns gadgets and action galore but action for actions sake can be a bore. Sure its got Berry but no Oscar statuette can turn this murky script to gold. If you watch movies chiefly for stunts and special effects this Bond is for you. If you watch to see a beloved formula regurgitated make tracks. Just dont expect to see strong new characters or a comprehensible plot. Die is about violent action at the expense of human interaction. Take Berrys Jinx a barely discernible character whos already being touted for an action franchise of her own. We learn almost nothing about her and its not because shes mysterious. No actress could flesh out this thinly written role. It doesnt help that Berrys looks are more suited to a fashion runway than an airport runway where she chases jets. Unlike Madonna who appears briefly as a fencing instructor she lacks the muscles to make much mayhem. Berry has said she was ""more at home in Jinxs fashion gowns"" than in action scenes. Though Jinx looks good in gowns and leather jackets she aims weapons with the precision of a woman waving a hankie and her battle gusto never heats above a simmer. (She also spends two sustained scenes held captive.) Rosamund Pike has a meatier part as another agent Miranda Frost. She mixes it up nicely both in battle and in clinches with the old make-out king. The bad guys are renegade soldiers from North Korea which revealed its nuclear threat too late to be in Neal Purvis and Robert Wades suddenly stale screenplay. Also making mischief are twisted wealthy wonder-boy Gustav (Toby Stephens son of Dame Maggie Smith) and Korean lackey Zao (Rick Yune) with a diamond-embedded face. Their evil scheme recycles the satellite weaponry of GoldenEye the gems motif of Diamonds Are Forever and the revenge-minded villainy of -- well you name it. The betrayal of Bond erupts in a hefty 13-minute prologue gorged with gunfire and a hovercraft chase (bad call -- theyre awkward and slow). Under the credits hes then tortured in the tradition of Casino Royale (the novel not the maverick movie). Cut to 14 months later when the suave spy is shockingly bearded bedraggled and still captive in Korea. Redemption doesnt come easily -- or does it? Absurdly implausible escapes rescues and attacks are what Bond movies have come to mean. Theyre not about espionage but sabotage with Bond busier blowing things up than sniffing things out. This seems a new stab at making the old guy edgy. Die is the first Bond film with a punk anthem (the Clashs London Calling) and it even adds the extreme-sports irrelevancies of youth-geared XXX. (Though Bond doesnt skateboard he does surf into battle.) One stunt involves a fiery space beam a melting ice cliff and a makeshift hang glider. Its silly enough to trigger howls of laughter if not protest. Far more involving -- and convincing -- is the films vivid swordplay. A drawback of todays computer-aided effects is that scenes deemed possible are deemed worthy -- credibility be damned. When a stunt is patently impossible no sophisticated tricks can make it seem real. This negates the human element that served earlier Bond films well. Dies homages to Bonds history are a treat from the lethal laser of Goldfinger and lines such as ""Diamonds are for everyone"" to Berry aping Ursula Andress surf entrance in Dr. No and hints of how novelist Ian Fleming chose his spys name. In the littered workshop of gadget guy Q (John Cleese) we also see such relics as the dagger-tipped shoes of From Russia With Love and the jet backpack of Thunderball. Cleeses scene is the films best -- and funniest. Unlike Judi Denchs M whos less commanding than exasperated this time the deadpan no-nonsense Q puts the cavalier Bond in his place. From wisecracks to cracking skulls Brosnan wears the role well in his fourth outing. Few actors who look so good in a tux could be so tough in a brawl and after Bonds rough captivity its heartening to see him turned loose. But to what end? Bond seems more bent on grim personal justice than saving our bacon and too often hes just another boy with his toys even driving an invisible car. Die looks good from exotic locales in Iceland and Spain to handsome production design especially a fanciful ice hotel. Its also noisy enough to keep you awake when the plot stalls between brief blurts of exposition. In terms of fueling a marketing machine director Lee Tamahori pushes the right buttons. Die looks almost as dazzling stretched over 132 minutes as in its three-minute trailer which says a lot. But in terms of spark and an engaging plot he should have heeded Madonnas title song. When you brandish the lyric ""Im going to avoid the cliche"" then Papa youd better practice what you preach. Grade B- Todays Deals Tactical Cree XML 4000-Lumen LED Flashlight for 8 + free...

Story Tools RELATED  Interactive Pick your favorite Bond  Gallery 40 years of Bond  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.com EW.COM  Movie reviews  Official Web Site Die Another Day VIDEO CNNs Jason Carroll has more on the 40th anniversary of the James Bond film franchise and takes a look at Die Another Day the 20th movie in the series. (November 21) PLAY VIDEO (CNN) -- ""I wasnt impressed"" muttered a woman behind me as we exited the industry screening for ""Die Another Day."" I couldnt agree more. Sure its all wrapped in a big glossy cinematic package Pierce Brosnan still takes his martinis shaken not stirred Halle Berry is drop dead gorgeous in her orange bikini while rising like Venus on a-half-shell off a Cuban beach and as always there are plenty of gadgets. But there is something so 20th Century about James Bond. Taking into account such films as ""The Matrix"" (1999) and the new technology evident in other movies such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Harry Potter"" series this 40 year-old franchise is beginning to look frayed around the edges. That being said ""Die Another Day"" will make millions and will undoubtedly be the No. 1 film in the country next week. The film does begin with an excellent cold open. Even before the opening credits roll youre treated to a great sequence in which Bond and some special forces cohorts surf their way onto a North Korean beach and proceed to assassinate a rogue North Korean colonel who plans to invade the south. Its an impossible and completely over-the-top sequence -- in other words pure James Bond. Unfortunately Bond has been double crossed and the mission results in his capture by the North Koreans. After 14-months of torture M (once again played by Judi Dench) and other powers-that-be back in London fear Bond has cracked and -- even though he has now lost his usefulness -- they arrange to get him out of North Korea before he spills everything he knows. Of course 007 hasnt cracked. The only thing hes spilled is a bit of blood dripping artfully from his perfectly shaped nostril. Now Bond has to escape from his own government and hunt down whoever set him up. And were off. More style than substance As usual the plot makes no sense -- this is a Bond movie after all and a plot would be way too much to ask for -- but I digress. There are some wonderful one-liners scattered here and there and of course a few wicked double entendres but overall this script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade just fills in the spaces between action sequences. Berry shines as Jinx a Bond Girl who can hold her own. Toby Stevens (""Possession"") portrays the supervillian Gustav Graves Rick Yune (""The Fast And The Furious"") plays his evil sidekick Zao and both come across as standard issue Bond bad guys. Naturally there is a heavy babe factor here. Leading the pack is Academy Award-winning actress Halle Berry (""Monsters Ball"" 2001). Shes the first Bond girl with an Oscar on her mantle. Kim Basinger is also an Academy Award winner (""L.A. Confidential"" 1997) and a Bond girl but her Oscar came years after her turn as a Bond magnet. Berry is delicious as Jinx an undercover National Security Agent for the United States government. She meets Bond in Cuba but somehow she too is involved in the whole mess in Korea. Remember the plot is secondary; her exact reason for being there is far from clear. What is clear is that she looks great in a string bikini. Jinx is no shrinking violet however. She saves Bonds cookies from getting baked a couple of times and he gallantly returns the favor. Newcomer Rosamund Pike also makes a lovely -- if somewhat flat -- impression. Director Lee Tamahori (""The Edge"" 1997 ""Along Came A Spider"" 2001) keeps things spinning while throwing in all the standard Bond ingredients. A world-wide stage fast cars full of automatic weapons and missiles lots of meaningless sex on very expensive sheets and gigantic stunts accompanied by gigantic explosions. But overall its so so predictable. Theres a heavy stench of ""been there done that"" hanging over the film. Its everything youd expect -- but nothing more. ""Die Another Day"" opens nationwide on Friday November 22 and is rated PG-13 with a running time of 123 minutes.

"Die Another Day 007 on Thin Ice washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Die Another Day 007 on Thin Ice Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday November 22 2002 ""Die Another Day"" is the 20th installment in the dependably mind-numbing and lucrative James Bond franchise which is beginning to creak not only with age but with the strain of constant self-one-upmanship in giving us exotic locales explosive geopolitics and unbelievable stunts. Then again maybe the Bond pictures havent gotten old - they just cant keep up with a world in which it seems that increasingly psychotic and violent things happen only because they can. To its credit ""Die Another Day"" makes an attempt at 21st-century realism starting with the traditional opening sequence during which James (Pierce Brosnan) engages in sprightly derring-do before making a spectacular escape from sure death. Of course he doesnt die - two very long hours depend on that fact - but he doesnt escape either. By the time ""Die Another Day"" really gets going the audience has seen James imprisoned tortured groomed to resemble John Walker Lindh and finally released to his boss M (Judi Dench) who considers him a security breach. When he wriggles free of her care he lands in Cuba where he is helped by one of Castros gray eminences - even Bond it seems has succumbed to Havanaphilia. But soon enough ""Die Another Day"" reverts to type which will be a comfort to stalwart Bond fans but not terribly interesting to anyone else. The first set piece of an absurd chase involving hovercraft tanks (not exactly as sleek as say a couple of Aston Martins) is a tip-off to whats in store. Bonds brief stay in Havana has a certain retro flair and the ice hotel in Iceland where much of the action transpires has a chic chilly glow. But most of ""Die Another Day"" in which Bond hunts down a North Korean baddie who is trading in diamonds toward some unknown but world-dominating end is as lumbering and graceless as well a hovercraft tank. To enjoy the James Bond films viewers dont have to suspend disbelief as much as disengage their cerebral cortices and that is as it should be. But theres only so much ridiculousness the human mind can take and director Lee Tamahori crosses that line by a good 20 minutes. There are death-defying escapes from burning buildings and crashing planes theres para-surfing on a tidal wave and a near-drowning in a melting hotel room. There are fistfights and sword fights and catfights. There are those hovercraft and a helicopter and a disappearing automobile. In the films funniest scene Bonds gadget haberdasher Q (John Cleese) outfits James with his requisite toys a glass-shattering ring a supercharged watch (""Your 20th I believe"") and a car whose dashboard includes buttons for grenade mortar and adaptive camouflage. There are enough lasers to outfit every plastic surgeon in Los Angeles the villains are still preposterously bad shots and the good guys are just good enough shots to make sure there can be a movie. It all feels tired worn out and unfunny right down to the sexual double-entendres that were ironically postmodern in the 60s but sound decidedly premodern now. Like every other Bond film ""Die Another Day"" isnt a narrative as much as a series of gestures and it demands actors of enough physical ability grace and charisma to carry them off. Brosnan has proved himself equal to the task (like Sean Connery and unlike the actors who came in between) and most of his co-stars - many of them newcomers - are too. One glaring exception is Madonna who delivers a characteristically wooden cameo appearance as a fencing instructor. Uncomfortably laced into a dowdy leather corset shes supposed to give ""Die Another Day"" an Samp;M frisson. But she flops as does the theme she apparently phoned in to be played over the films opening sequence. However tiresome ""Die Another Day"" is there is one shining glimmer of hope in the person of the sensational Halle Berry who plays Agent Jinx a spunky sexy super-spy of uncertain affiliation. From the minute she emerges from a Havana inlet looking like a multicultural Ursula Andress on the half shell Berry not only proves that she is physically able to plant bombs pilot jets and land punches with authority but she also manages to deliver an actual performance - and a warm convincing and funny one at that. Theres already talk of a Jinx spinoff which is encouraging news. It might be time for 007 to gallantly move aside and make way for another considerably hotter number. DIE ANOTHER DAY (PG-13 123 minutes) - Contains action violence and sexuality. At area theaters.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Desson Howe November 22 2002 IF YOU want to see a monument to permanence watch ""Die Another Day"" the latest James Bond film. Or the one before it. Or the one before that . . . So far (as in 40 years) this refusal to break its own mold has served the Bond empire well. Every Bond release since the 1963 ""Dr. No"" has made money to the combined tune of 3.5 billion. Bond keeps coming back because the world keeps voting it back. The last Bond flick 1999s ""The World Is Not Enough"" made more than 365 million worldwide. ""Die Another Day"" budgeted at way more than 100 million and starring Pierce Brosnan needs to clear even more. But if the past continues to be prologue then ""Die"" has done all the right things. Its makers should draw marketing but not artistic pride in that. Surely it will not be giving things away to tell you theres absolutely nothing new about the latest episode. Lee Tamahori the latest director in the franchise and screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have followed all the rules including the opening action scene; the girl-saturated title sequence (featuring a Madonna electronica song); exotic locales (Cuba Iceland etc.); the girls (the marquee babe being Halle Berry); the gadgets; and the action. Bond has his usual meetings with M (Dame Judi Dench) and Q (John Cleese the freshest breath of air in the whole movie). And once again theres futuristic criminal activity (genetic DNA alteration) and a satellite about to rain some sort of destruction or climate alteration on all those people lining up for the latest Bond movie. Tamahori (a cinematic whiz kid and pop historian of sorts) has also filled the movie with tributes to old Bond flicks. Berry enters this movie like Ursula Andress did in ""Dr. No"" dripping from the sea and dressed in a skin-hugging swimsuit. One of the bad guys has a face scarred and pocked with diamonds -- the result of a booby trap courtesy of 007. And at one point Bond enters a room filled with old-time gadgets from Bond films past. This begs such questions as What is a James Bond film? A movie a feat of recycling a marketing miracle or all of the above? Is the world going to give its blessing once more to Brosnan and the extended Bond family? Will Berry seal the box office deal with her mixture of gym-toned sexuality and postfeminist swagger? And does a franchise thats a never-ending monument to itself deserve yet another salute or a messy rebuke from overhead pigeons? MGMs bean counters are waiting for the answers to these pressing questions. So are producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson children of the late founding father Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli. And so are Brosnans agent and manager whose hands remain poised over the ""Pierce -- New Screen Projects"" file. Its up to the world again.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 22 2002 1200AM EST Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 142AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Die Another Day Directed by Lee Tamahori Written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade Starring Pierce Brosnan Halle Barry and Toby Stephens Classification AA Rating 1/2 For anyone who has ever wanted to see James Bond get mussed up and the smirk wiped off his face Die Another Day the spys 40th-anniversary movie is your chance. Along with the usual bullets babes car chases and megalomaniacs to thwart Bond runs into some serious career trouble and has a (brief) dark night of the soul. In a movie thats distinguished by some higher heights than most recent Bonds and some new lows Die Another Day also sees Bond do battle with obviously artificial digitally created backgrounds and effects. In compensation theres Halle Berry as a rarity among Bond girls of recent vintage; someone who can look good rising up from the surf in a coral bikini and also offer some acting spice. Though shes underused Berry adds some needed weight to the distaff side of the Bond film balance. After the usual precredit sequence we jump to surfers and a dateline in North Korea. Not just any surfers but top-secret military-type surfers dude including 007 himself. Bonds mission is to interrupt an international illegal diamonds-for-weapons swap with a couple of rogue Korean officers in the demilitarized zone. (North Koreans function here as in American foreign policy as convenient evildoers.) The swap goes awry and after a nasty explosion that bejewels the face of a Korean bad guy Zao (Rick Yune) and an extended Hovercraft chase Bond gets captured. This is not just a cooling-off period. For 14 months Bond is in the slammer without lovers martinis or the opportunity to rack up air-mile points. The months roll by in a bizarrely sexual torture montage with Bond in bondage head repeatedly dunked in a bucket and body covered with scorpions. All of this is interspersed with the usual silhouettes of writhing womens bodies as the title song (a sinewy dance-beat thing sung by Madonna) plays. What this could mean remains perplexing but at least it beats Hovercraft chases. When Bond finally gets released looking like Jesus or at least a fatter Tom Hanks from Castaway its through no ingenuity of his own but through a prisoner exchange. M (Judy Dench) tells him hes through and he has to lose his beloved licence to kill leaving him with little more than liberty to quip. Every hero needs to be revitalized by a little humiliation and for at least the first 40 minutes of Die Another Day Bonds dressing-down seems to do him and the movie franchise a world of good. Director Lee Tamahori ( Once Were Warriors The Edge) brings hints of heroic mythology an attempt to prove that Bonds do not necessarily have more fun. Wearing a little touch of grey on his temples the fallen hero is associated with dark appetites (""sex for dinner; death for breakfast"") and he must descend into the underground (an abandoned London tube station) to regain his powers. The small quivery note of doubt (could 007 really be . . . vulnerable?) is soon overtaken by enough improbabilities to break most of the laws designed by Darwin Newton and Moses. There are to name a few examples identity-changing bone-marrow treatments artificial suns and a Korean father and son who speak to each other in different languages. But soon swagger wins out after an amusing reversal of a conventional Bond scene in which he strides through a swank lobby (the Hong Kong Yacht Club) half-naked and scruffy looking like a cave man who has taken assertiveness training. Next Bond heads off to Cuba where he learns his Korean enemy is holed up in a well-guarded island health clinic. In a series of nods to Dr. No the first Bond film Bond meets Halle Berrys character a beauty arising from the surf a la Ursula Andress. Her name is Jinx and after the usual mind-numbingly sexual banter they move beyond the verbal. Soon it becomes clear that Jinx is Bonds equal and possibly a rival. After Cuba the scriptwriters apparently resigned handing over the rest of the story duties to the films action unit. The ensuing hopscotch travelogue next moves to London where Bond is on hand to witness the arrival-by-parachute of businessman Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) a mysterious diamond merchant. Bond accepts the challenge of the arrogant Graves which provides the best-directed sequence in the film -- a sword fight where each man gets to swash his buckle impressively and the mens club where it takes place is destroyed in the process. Later Bond reconciles with M picks up some new toys -- including a stealth Austin-Martin -- and at Gustavs invitation heads off to Iceland with Graves and his equally subtly named ice-queen publicist Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) to witness Gravess new invention/weapon. Jinx shows up in Iceland too and soon everyone is chasing everyone else around the ice palace in sports cars on ice dodging pink lasers. The battle climaxes with one of the most artificial computer-generated stunts in recent movie history as Bond wearing an improvised parachute apparently skips over the top of a tsunami; its bad enough to make Nintendos Super Mario game look like documentary realism. About the time youre ready to say ""enough"" the movie adds another action set piece with the cast returning to Korea for another bout of hand-to-hand combat on a crashing cargo plane. The audience should be well worn-out by then but the middle-aging Bond emerges with smirk and hair intact ready to be spry again another day.

Like a bus on a well-traveled route ""Die Another Day"" makes all the familiar stops but careens full-throttle in between as the action switches from North Korea to Cuba to Iceland and back. Pierce Brosnan suits up for his fourth go-round as the debonair British superspy and with an irresistible combination of ramrod-straight poise and rakish charm has finally taken ownership of the role. Helming a Bond film has typically been an exercise for journeymen directors but New Zealands Lee Tamahori (""Once Were Warriors"" ""The Edge"") manages to bring a distinctive flair to the bravura action sequences. And aside from a jarringly fake computer-generated avalanche scene that momentarily challenges the necessary suspension of disbelief the big-bang set pieces are superbly crafted. In a blatant grab for the Gen Y demographic Bond literally surfs into the new millennium in the traditional grasp-you-by-the-collar pre-title sequence landing on the North Korean side of the demilitarized zone and setting the scene for a politically topical showdown. Before the whole shebang explodes into a relentless blast of uber-cool gadgets and ribald repartee there is an unusually grim expositional stretch. Bond confronts a communist colonel (Will Yun Lee) trafficking in ""conflict"" diamonds but the plan goes awry and after a spectacular Hovercraft chase over a minefield Bond is tossed in jail. Fourteen months of solitude and torture later a grimy and bearded - but still strapping - Bond is exchanged for political prisoner Zao (Rick Yune) whose diamond shrapnel scars give him what is referred to as ""expensive acne."" Accused by MI6 of betraying secrets under torture Bond is stripped of his license to kill and spends much of the rest of the film operating as a renegade. Subjecting Bond to real physical pain and the mental anguish of having his loyalty questioned has the effect of making him more human than weve seen him since his wife died in the vastly underrated ""On Her Majestys Secret Service."" But once he lands in Cuba orders a mojito (muddled not stirred?) and sparks up some crackling chemistry with foxy American spy Jinx (Oscar-winner Halle Berry having a ball) ""Die"" shifts gears into more familiar territory. From then on it is as window-dressing Bond Girl Miranda Frost (newcomer Rosamund Pike) remarks ""sex for dinner and death for breakfast"" as Jinx and 007 go after villain Rupert Graves (Toby Stephens) a megalomaniac British entrepreneur with a smile that looks like a snarl a shimmering ice-palace lair and a preposterous invention that will help him achieve - thats right - world domination. The script penned by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who co-wrote 1999s ""The World Is Not Enough"" twists and turns with enough insider betrayals and shape-shifting villains to keep it engaging and the geopolitical setting feels vaguely in keeping with current events. Even Madonna doesnt suck in an unbilled cameo as a kinky fencing mistress named Verity. (Note to the filmmakers Bring back the deliciously perverse Bond Girl monikers that seem to have disappeared with Xenia Onatopp.) This 40th-anniversary release also pays winking homage to its predecessors with the inclusion of subtle references like a Union Jack parachute the laser-threat from ""Goldfinger"" - and the not-so-subtle spectacle of Berry emerging from the sea in a low-slung bikini in tribute to the original Bond Girl Ursula Andress. Theres one explosion too many in ""Die"" but whos counting? Bond still has upstart action heroes like Vin Diesels Xander Cage eating his dust.

Its flawed but its the best 007 flick in 20 years. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Its a testament to the eternal optimism of moviegoers that nearly everyone looks forward to a new James Bond picture. It never matters how disappointing the last one might have been The franchise which is now 40 years old has come to mean something more than the sum of its highly inconsistent parts. For one thing the series is safe as milk thats been neither shaken nor stirred -- grannies of many stripes will happily watch the older Bonds (and maybe some of the newer ones) on the telly when they show up. At the same time theres still something vaguely disreputable about the Bond movies; its more an aura than a theorem that can be proved. When theyre bad they leave us feeling disappointingly clean. But when theyre good we walk away feeling just a little dirty -- a bit treacherous and elegant ourselves if only for an hour or so. With just a bit of streamlining ""Die Another Day"" the 20th Bond picture might have left us feeling very very dirty. As it is the movie is hobbled by an overblown climax that feels tacked on a trundling sorry patchwork of needless explosions and weary derring-do that reads like an apology -- a coda thrown in at great expense (these are big explosions) in case we didnt find the rest of the movie exciting enough. Thats a shame because right up until that climax -- which mucks up the movies last half-hour or so -- ""Die Another Day"" has plenty of the wit and style that the Bond movies have been missing for the past 20 years or so. Pierce Brosnan who has played Bond in the last four movies has sometimes been a perfectly adequate 007 and sometimes a disappointing one depending largely on whats going on around him Hes elegant and often very human but hes also rather stiff as if he has sometimes found it hard to compete with so many deafening explosions and can-you-top-this stunts. Brosnan has been livelier in pictures like ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" and ""The Tailor of Panama"" than he has in any of his first three Bond movies; in ""Die Another Day"" he seems to have finally brought it all together. Hes both relaxed and sly and his lines have a nice ring to them like the satisfying ping you get when you tap a piece of fine crystal. And in the best Bond tradition he isnt afraid to play the fool occasionally. When the terrific ""new"" Q (not that the late great Desmond Llewellyn can ever quite be replaced) John Cleese shows 007 some of the new gadgets Bond looks him over and takes a good-natured jab at him ""Youre cleverer than you look."" Cleeses Q coolly sends it right back at him ""And youre looking cleverer than you are."" Brosnans Bond takes it like a gent with an unabashed little laugh that shows he knows hes been topped. Perhaps Brosnan is particularly good here because for once hes actually been given something to do. At least until that ill-advised climax director Lee Tamahori whose credits include ""Once Were Warriors"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" and writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade seem to have taken care to give us something different from the same old Bond. Tamahori seems out to entertain us rather than just impress us and that distinction makes all the difference. For the 2.9 percent of the population who expect a contemporary Bond movie to be a model of coherence its crucial to note that the plot of ""Die Another Day"" doesnt make a whole lot of sense although there are moments when Tamahori fools us into thinking that maybe it will. In the opening sequence Bond is captured in a demilitarized zone between North and South Korea after botching an assignment to kill a power-crazed baddie. When 007 is finally released he zigzags across the globe from Hong Kong to Cuba to London to Iceland to track down that villains right-hand man the steely Zao (Rick Yune) whos pretty easy to spot thanks to the glittering diamonds that have been embedded into his cheek after an unfortunate accident with an exploding briefcase.While hes looking for Zao Bond bumps into yet another villain the icy gazillionaire Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) who it just so happens is about to unveil a giant weapon that will bring the world to its knees. (Remember the world always has knees in a Bond film.) You Might Also Like Stephens (whos the son of actors Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens) makes a lovely villain -- hes like a sneering schoolboy youd really like to punch out -- and he balances Brosnans warmer brand of classiness well. The two also share one of the finest action sequences in any Bond movie a sword fight that takes place in a tony fencing club. (Madonna makes a brief amusing cameo as a fencing instructor; shes wonderful when shes simply allowed to be a presence in a movie instead of attempting to impersonate an actress.) Tamahori and cinematographer David Tattersall keep the action clean clear and blissfully old-fashioned. Bond and Graves stripped down to their trousers and expensive white T-shirts go at each other with a murderousness thats both refined and feral. The scene is a gorgeous example of modern-day swashbuckling and a nod to the fine tradition of stage combat -- the sort of thing we used to get in the movies when fighting meant more than just fancy cutting in the editing room. But that sword fight also creates its own set of problems The next leg of Bonds adventure takes him to a magnificent ice palace in -- where else? -- Iceland. But even all that glamorous icy whiteness feels underwhelming after the exhilarating simplicity of that good old-fashioned English swordplay. The action becomes noisier and murkier; and while the movie opens with a nicely executed surfing scene the Iceland segment features Bond riding some very cheesy-looking computer-generated waves. Thats just one example of the puzzling inconsistencies that litter ""Die Another Day."" Tamahori gives us some marvelous details Gadgets have taken a back seat in recent Bond movies but care has been taken here to give us some good ones. And theres the brilliant touch of a spy headquarters located in an abandoned London Underground station. How can Tamahori get so many of the smaller tougher things right only to turn around and get most of the easier things wrong? But you can say this much about him He seems to have brought out a sense of lightness and fun in his actors. Halle Berry as Jinx -- a vixen who may or may not be fighting on the ""right"" side -- simply looks as if shes having a wonderful time whether shes emerging from a dip in the ocean in an orange bikini a white knife holster dangling from her hip Ursula Andress-style or interrupting her lovemaking with Bond to flip out a penknife so she can cut into a juicy piece of fruit. She also gets one of the best Bond-girl costumes since the days of Honor Blackman A leather catsuit rendered in magnificent aubergine instead of black. Tamahoris ""Die Another Day"" is an imperfect Bond movie. But for every patch where its dull and lifeless or just plain stupid there are also sections that are significantly different from anything weve seen before in a Bond movie. For one thing ""Die Another Day"" opens with Bond in disgrace. Hes been held captive (and tortured) in a Korean prison camp for 14 months; when British intelligence finally reluctantly rescues him its made clear that his glory days are over. As M once again played by the magnificent Judi Dench tells him with almost unbearable coldness ""Youre no use to anyone now."" In ""Die Another Day"" its failure that galvanizes Bond and forces him into action. Were not used to seeing a demoralized Bond. And yet Brosnan plays that Bond beautifully giving us a glimpse of what can happen to a supremely confident and successful man when everything and everyone turns against him. This is a more vulnerable Bond than weve ever seen but also perhaps not paradoxically a more masculine one. By the end of ""Die Another Day"" Bond is surer of himself precisely because hes been forced to reckon with his limitations. Every James Bond from Sean Connery to Roger Moore to Timothy Dalton to Brosnan has looked great in a tuxedo. Here he looks at home in his own skin as well.

The Oscar-winning actress looks antsy and uncomfortable as though the job of being the latest in a leggy line of Bond babes - required to shoot smooch and trade naughty quips with the debonair spy guy - was beneath her. And for all their lusty banter (jokes about the Big Bang theory among them) Brosnan and Berry radiate little heat.After arriving in North Korea (via surfboard) and trying to thwart an elaborate diamond deal at the outset of Die Another Day the British secret agent is captured - and spends the next 14 months locked up and tortured. The North Koreans also make him go around without a shirt which means audiences can see how buff Brosnan can be even in the toughest of circumstances.Once escaped Bond has a misunderstanding with his boss M (Judi Dench) who threatens to send him to the Falklands for debriefing. Instead Bond decides to keep his briefs and go freelance. Next thing you know hes walking into a swanky Hong Kong hotel where both the manager and the masseuse have hidden agendas. Then its on to Havana where Bond contacts a sleeper (thats spy talk for somebody who er likes to sleep a lot) and then visits an off-shore clinic where all kinds of top-secret DNA rejiggering is going on.Die Another Day winds up in the Icelandic lair of the rich evil bad guy Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) - an ice palace thats more Las Vegas than Reykjavik. Bond and Berrys character Jinx (she turns out to be working for the U.S.) jump through a few more hoops and Rosamund Pike gets to act coolly seductive as an MI-6 agent with the name Miranda Frost.And then theres Madonna who provides the movies techno-beat theme song (over a decidedly subpar title sequence) and who also appears as a fencing instructress who gets to watch Bond and his nemesis make a mess of her academy.Wheres Austin Powers when you really need him baby?Contact Steven Rea at sreaphillynews.com or 215-854-5629.Die Another Day  (Out of four stars)Produced by Michael C.

"Bonds 40 but refuses to behave - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEW Bonds 40 but refuses to behaveNovember 22 2002|Manohla Dargis | Times Staff Writer Timely -- and as demographically savvy as ever -- James Bond enters his new adventure off the coast of North Korea with some fast and furious surfing designed to show the ""XXX"" generation that the 007 dude still has the stuff. The waves and silhouetted figures riding the massive curls inspire a shiver of delight along with a tremor of hope that the worlds coolest franchise has finally ditched his blockbuster bloat and just maybe the Dry Look in order to power-surf into the new millennium. Its about then as the waves and our hopes crest that ""Die Another Day"" cuts to one of the surfers pulling off his mask to reveal the untroubled face of Pierce Brosnan whose glazed implacability suggests a man who rarely gets shaken much less stirred.Launched with ""Dr. No"" the Bond franchise began 40 years ago with Her Majestys sexiest spy thwarting a plot to destroy the American space program while swanning about Jamaica a setting that lent an undeniable frisson to the films premiere during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The latest Bond opens against a similarly providential geopolitical backdrop on the North Korean side of the demilitarized zone. The communist nation is such a freakish unsexy locale (no purring Pussy Galore here) that once 007 lands you want him to surf right out again. Instead he squares off against a colonel (Will Yun Lee) whos trafficking in diamonds mined in horror spots such as Sierre Leone only to have his cover blown.The botch leads to a Hovercraft chase followed by 14 months of Bond bondage torture and beard growth that bizarrely unfolds to the techno thump of Madonnas cheerless title song and under the usual opening-credit nudie cuties. Once freed and faced with charges that he gave up other agents while imprisoned Bond spends the remainder of the story shaking off the films dank opening as he clears his name and traces blood diamonds to Iceland by way of London and a snarky magnate Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). Among the other players the agent encounters as he hopscotches continents are one of colonels henchmen Zao (Rick Yune) an arm accessory named Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) and an enigma in a hot bikini Jinx played by Halle Berry Bonds newest love interest and Brosnans highly visible partner in advertising.Berry brings about as much conviction as you might expect to a role that essentially is the bodacious equivalent of a hit of Viagra. First seen rising up from the Caribbean waters as Ursula Andress did in ""Dr. No"" a knife strapped to the belt slung over her hips the Academy Award-winner has been brought in to jump-start Bonds engine and as a consequence she never fully transcends the standard Bond girl limitations. She looks fabulous running after bad guys while brandishing a gun her sundress lashing her bare thighs but shes also about as persuasive an operative as Beyonce Knowles was in the last Austin Powers lollapalooza. It isnt only that Berry lacks the ferocious determination that turned Carrie-Anne Moss into a cult with the release of ""The Matrix""; its that the Bond movie shes signed onto lacks it as well.Perched uneasily between lingering self-parody and the filmmakers clear desire for a Bond vehicle to be taken seriously as an action movie ""Die Another Day"" remains caught somewhere in between. There are times when it feels like two separate at times warring movies. The first stars Brosnan a very fit 49-year-old actor whos nonetheless 49 and whose callow appeal has been best put to use in films that bring out his vaguely louche hauteur as John Boorman did in his underrated spy movie ""The Tailor of Panama."" The second Bond film in turn features younger actors such as Berry and Rick Yune (""The Fast and the Furious"") whose sleek black clothes and martial-arts poses offer continued evidence that ""The Matrix"" is the type of defining movie that doesnt just cast long shadows it reconfigures the very genre.The Bond films have almost always been primarily feats of engineering and directing them has often seemed better suited to technicians rather than to artists or craftsmen Their real auteurs have always been the star the producers the composers and opening-credit guru Maurice Binder. Yet we expect more out of our action movies than we did in the early 1960s (we expect John Woo or ""The Matrix"") which is why the Bond producers have in recent years tried to elevate the filmmaking by bringing in something of a name director. The gambit to class up ""The World Is Not Enough"" didnt pan out however and director Michael Apteds contribution remains an undistinguished blur made conspicuous only by the insanely silly casting of the pneumatically endowed Denise Richards as a ""Doctor of Atomic Physics.""1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAs Skyfall opens a look at pioneering tech from Bond filmsNovember 8 2012Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/22/entertainment/et-dargis22,200,dieanotherday26,dieanotherday,latimes

Just as Graham Greenes characters usually manage to drag themselves (by the chin if necessary and often contrary to everything they refuse to believe) over the threshold of the sanctuary into a state of real or partial--and usually highly compromised--redemption so filmmakers are returning to Greene himself and trying to do right by him the better to redeem the perceived sins of their cinematic forebears. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Greene was probably right to feel he had been hard done by on film. When he himself was behind the typewriter things usually went smoothly and the results--Carol Reeds The Third Man and The Fallen Idol Alberto Cavalcantis anti-Mrs. Miniver home-front melodrama Went the Day Well?--are easily the most memorable films taken from his work. However the list of inadequate bad or even treacherous adaptations of his novels is a long and depressing one. Perhaps most famously there is the movie that really soured Greenes view of Hollywood Joseph Mankiewiczs 1958 adaptation of his novel of the early years of the Vietnam conflict The Quiet American whose ending was re-jigged in such a way as to betray utterly Greenes ideas about the geopolitical morass of Southeast Asia. Filmmakers today knowing the hash their predecessors often made of Greene the first time out approach his work clad in the penitents sackcloth the scourge ever at hand lest they feel tempted to mess with the Word. In remaking The End of the Affair a couple of years ago Neil Jordan devoutly abased himself before Greenes shrine yet wound up with exactly the same problems as Edward Dmytryks 1955 version Jordans movie is finally a superior Cliffs Notes to a probably unfilmable novel. Now Phillip Noyce returning to his left-wing political roots and a tight budget after a decade of expensive right-wingish Tom Clancy adaptations has attempted to make up for what Mankiewicz wrought. Greene wrote the novel after spending four winters in Vietnam between 1951 and 1954 as a correspondent for Life and Londons Sunday Times. Famous for its local accuracy and political prescience the novel became an essential component of 1960s journalists education in the roots of the Vietnam conflict. Its central character an aging cynical English journalist named Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine) becomes friendly with the uncharacteristically quiet American Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) a well-scrubbed innocent supposedly in the employ of the American Legation but actually a CIA operative. Then Pyle lays eyes on Fowlers Vietnamese mistress Phuong (beautiful newcomer Do Thi Hai Yen) and soon announces quite baldly that he intends to remove her from the care of her unworthy protector and steer her toward a richer freer life as the future Mrs. Pyle in some small New England town where ""even the celery comes wrapped in cellophane."" Fowler in fact is a kind of enhanced stand-in for the famously disreputable and libidinous Greene he drinks smokes opium daily keeps a pliable mistress and knows the names of all the French porno mags. Pyle though Greene always denied it is derived from the famous OSS/CIA operative Colonel Edward Lansdale who like Pyle was responsible for backing a violent ""third force"" neither colonialist nor communist in the emerging conflict. When we first encounter Pyle hes dead of stab wounds and the movie like the novel circles back to the first encounter between the two men. It witnesses the decline of their unlikely friendship into a sexual rivalry for the passive (""Sometimes she seemed invisible like peace"") but pragmatic Phuong which mirrors the three-way struggle for the soul of the country. When Fowler finally accepts a measure of political involvement and betrays Pyle to the communists--outwardly at least in disgust at the bloodshed Pyle has caused in his role as a terrorist for Democracy--his motives are powerfully adulterated by sexual jealousy. Its an archetypal Greene construction--the rack on which he breaks his luckless creations a delicate cats cradle of interlocking hostilities and mixed motives filled with mirror images and polar opposites. Fowler is a man detached a nonbeliever Pyle a Christian a committed innocent a virgin at 32--""an unmistakably young and unused face flung at us"" writes Greene ""like a dart."" Caine is about 15 years too old to play Fowler but his weary disdainful performance (loosely modeled says the actor on Greene himself) amply anchors the movie. Frasers Pyle is less successful though this has much to do with Greenes flawed and stereotypical characterization (for Greenes generation of Englishmen whether on the left or the right the adjective ""American"" was less spoken than expectorated). Looking oddly like his frozen-in-time character in Blast From the Past Fraser--in his boxy best-and-brightest suit; his sleeves-up; and with his can-do Walt Rostow fanaticism and especially his buzzcut and spectacles--seems to be modeled after 60s U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Fraser makes a brave attempt at a character weighed down by political/symbolic freight and by Greenes evident distaste for American culture and influence but finally he is a Canadian in a role that absolutely demands an American. For all his limitations as an actor Audie Murphy Mankiewiczs Pyle brought with him an immensely evocative set of associations--he was a war hero then a star of Westerns--and his earnest face was a tabula rasa on which anything could be read. Shot in Saigon by Hong Kong-based Australian cinematographer Chris Doyle Noyces remake certainly looks beautiful although Mankiewicz had the undoubted advantage of filming there before the Vietnamese phoenix (""phuong"") had fallen into the furnace or risen from the rubble. Any Australian of Noyces age has friends who died in Vietnam (because unlike Britain Australia allowed itself to be browbeaten by LBJ into sending troops) so there is no doubting his commitment to the material and to preserving Greenes baleful vision. He has made a good-looking intelligent stab at the novel mildly undermined by a tendency to seek contemporary relevance including a redundant montage of Fowlers supposed dispatches between 1952 when the novel ends and 1965 when the U.S. Marines arrived. No doubt the American right will have a field day disinterring then re-burying Greene and his powerful demolition of American adventurism but if The Quiet American stirs fresh debate about the unintended consequences of intervention abroad it will have served its purpose admirably.    Michael Caine as Walter Fowler If we demanded from filmmakers the same fidelity to Ian Flemings novels that we ask of those tackling Greenes the results might really depress us. First up the booze. Just count the snifters James Bond chugs in chapter one of Goldfinger four double bourbons two double martinis and a foaming pint of pink champagne. License to Kill? They wouldnt give this guy a License to Piss Unassisted. As for knocking combat boots with mocha-licious Halle Berry in the new Bond a.k.a. Die Another Day well try this from Live and Let Die ""The Chigroes have all the venality of the Chinaman and all the brutishness of the Negro."" Guess that puts paid to Michelle Yeoh as well.A revisionist Bond movie then might imagine him at age 55 in about 1975 empurpled by strong drink; given to frequent and splenetic fulminations against the unions the Labour Party the Jews and the wogs; and involved in one of those semi-clandestine and wholly ridiculous private armies of ex-spies and SAS officers that briefly flourished in paranoid mid-70s England. Director Lee Tamahori (Once Were Warriors Along Came a Spider) hasnt gone that far (or that crazy) though in Die Another Day he does fill the screen with witty nods to 40 years of Bond movies Berrys Jinx emerges from the Cuban surf in an orange version of Ursula Andress famous bikini-and-fish-knife combo in Dr. No and later undergoes a little old-school (well Gold-school) laser surgery. The Aston Martin is back (that Beamer was a sacrilege) and its invisible which is pretty neat. Et cetera. All thats missing are a piranha pool and blokes with lethal hats and golden guns. The result is the niftiest Bond movie in years--fresh funny and jammed to the rafters with demented stunts Boys-Own gadgetry and brazen promiscuity. Tamahori shoots and cuts action like a pro but he also has a surprisingly lyrical eye and sees to it that his actors are fully developed characters not just insertable-subtractible ciphers to fill villain- and babe-shaped holes on the screen. Purists and Bond-bores may bemoan the occasional computer-generated effects but the rest of us will be glad to see the Bond-wagon trouncing its many action-movie imitators for the first time in years.

Its stuffed with supersized action sequences explosions fights gadgets product placements double-crosses nudge-nudge one-liners the works.This fourth Pierce Brosnan entry in the series is positioning Bond for the future with an overload of computer-generated effects while offering multiple references to the early Bond films (or do you call them ripoffs?) and a throwback kind of spy plot. Too bad we dont get a throwback kind of memorable villain instead of yet another sneering meglomaniac.The movie looks sharp as does Halle Berry in a role that otherwise adds zippo to the story but it ultimately wears us down with set piece after set piece.

They were espionage dramas wrapped in the tinsel of gimmickry rather than the other way around. Die Another Day is the savviest and most exciting Bond adventure in years and thats because theres actually something at stake in it. No I dont mean the fate of the world (as if there were doubt about the outcome of that) but the fate of James Bond himself. Is he a walking action figure the kind of guy who might just as well be played by Bruce Willis in a tux or is he someone who still matters not because of what he does but because of the precise tenor with which he does it - the razory exactitude say with which he disarms a sexy masseuse whos got a gun strapped to her thigh and then smashes the mirrored wall where hes being videotaped by Chinese spies? In the sensational opening sequence of ""Die Another Day"" Bond (Pierce Brosnan) tries to trade a briefcase of diamonds to a sniveling young North Korean despot and when his secret-agent cover is blown he escapes in a high-speed chase over a road packed with land mines. Bond dodges flamethrowers and machine-gun fire and he all but dances around a moonwalking hovercraft to evade the villains leaping about with the graceful improv nonchalance of a man who knows that the physical karma of the moment will always favor his instincts. But then the unthinkable happens. Bond is captured and as the credits roll over the nifty electro-cut pauses of the title Madonna song images of Bond babes cast in smelting gold are superimposed on whats happening to our hero beatings scorpion injections his face held under ice water. Emerging from this torture chamber Bond looks like Kris Kristofferson with a very bad hangover and he is then rescued and subjected to the ultimate abuse Judi Dench as M gazing at him with withering Oxbridge contempt as she declaims ""Youre of no use to anyone now."" Its enough to make you wonder if shes been watching DVDs of ""GoldenEye"" and ""The World Is Not Enough."" In recent years the Bond series has grown bloated and decadent and - yes - dull coasting on the nostalgia we all share during those first 15 minutes when the twangy machine-gun guitar chords come rippling over the image of 007 firing his weapon at the audience followed by the inevitable action sequence thats so elaborately kicked-up its a mad logistical joke - and nothing more than a joke. ""Die Another Day"" on the other hand is directed by a true filmmaker Lee Tamahori (""Once Were Warriors"") and he has reestablished the series ominous pop sensuality. Tamahori gets the true trick of Bond that hes the ultimate agent because he keeps breaking rules even the ones approved by his side. The movie has a juicy smirking villain - the aforementioned Korean who has gone to a sinister DNA-transplant facility tucked away in Havana the kind of clinic that would look like a vacation spa to Michael Jackson and made himself over into a foppishly malicious British mogul of the new swinging London played by Toby Stephens with a charismatic flash of horsey upper gums. In his insolent way this dastardly fellow an African-diamond buccaneer who plans to turn a giant satellite reflector into a second sun is every bit as polished as Bond. The two face off in a fencing duel thats choreographed for maximum rousing glass-case-smashing abandon complete with bigger and bigger swords. Even as the violence spills over the top what keeps the sequence grounded is its furious battle of wills. I cant remember the last time that Bond and his archenemy so flagrantly didnt like each other. Stephens a terrific snarling actor whos the son of Maggie Smith raises the stakes for Brosnan who came closer to the true Bond spirit in ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" and ""The Tailor of Panama"" than he previously has in the series itself. Brosnan draws on his work in those films to infuse 007 with a new forceful twinkle - the perfect balance of purpose and play. Tamahori keeps the encounters human-scale whether hes getting John Cleese to slow-ball his archness as Q or staging Bonds sexual escapades in a way that preserves their naughty appeal but underplays the usual two-ton winks. Bonds love of the ladies isnt just an obligatory sideshow this time. Its been made crucial to the plot - his weakness as it were. Brosnan flirts up a storm with Halle Berry who brings superwoman confidence and a megawatt smile of temptation to the role of an American agent whos every bit the daredevil he is as well as with newcomer Rosamund Pike as an all-too-meltable British ice princess. Speaking of ice the climax of ""Die Another Day"" unfolds in a setting of spectacular cheesy grandeur. Were in Iceland at some sort of frozen palatial-hotel fortress in the white wilderness and the ice all looks plastic but when Bond leaps into a pointy-nosed ground glider and races seconds ahead of a reflected sunbeam thats trailing him like the wrath of God youre more than happy to sign on for the ride. The fakery goes right back to the kind we got in the 60s 007 films with their wide-eyed suspension of disbelief. But ""Die Another Day"" gets away with it because its the first Bond movie in ages that isnt fake fun.

"Die Another Day | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; die-another-day ) Die Another Day (United Kingdom/United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Imagine if you will the dispiriting experience of listening to an awful cover of one of your favorite songs. Thats how I felt sitting through Die Another Day the 20th official outing for Ian Flemings super-spy. This is a train wreck of an action film a a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs. Since XXX is a Bond wannabe that makes Die Another Day a second generation knock-off. Whats missing from this movie? Any real sense that were watching 007 rather than a generic spy in a tuxedo. Every Bond has had a bad outing (except George Lazenby who was only around for one movie). For Sean Connery it was his swansong Diamonds Are Forever. For Roger Moore it was Live and Let Die. And for Timothy Dalton it was The Living Daylights. One could argue that Die Another Day tops them all for sheer badness. The Bond movies have always skirted the edges of self-parody but this one blatantly crosses the line. The films abject silliness makes even Moores fatuous outings look serious and intelligently plotted. The need for action action and more action has reduced the plot to a minor footnote. Ditto for the characters a even Bond lacks his usual charisma. Brosnans other 007 outings were admittedly cartoonish (thats the nature of the beast) but they were bright lively and vivid. Die Another Day has stick figures. The people are secondary to the stunts and pyrotechnics which has never been the case before. Its disturbing to watch Die Another Day and realize that its no better than any second-rate spy thriller and even more disheartening to compare it to some of the great Bond movies of the past. The film begins with an interesting enough if decidedly un-Bond-like scenario 007 is captured during a mission to North Korea then tortured and imprisoned for 14 months before being traded to the West in a prisoner exchange. His quest for revenge which is initially not sanctioned by M (Judi Dench) takes him to Havana where he meets an American secret agent named Jinx (Halle Berry). It appears that both of them are after the same people albeit (possibly) for different reasons. Bond is pursuing a sadist named Zao (Rick Yune) and the trail leads to Iceland and the ice palace estate of billionaire Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens). To get closer to Graves Bond tries romancing his assistant Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) but learns that may not be the most fruitful route. Graves goal has something to do with world domination and the tool he intends to use is a giant space-based weapon that he controls and no one can stop. For Die Another Day some elements of the Bond formula are intact the cool gadgets (including an invisible car a glass-shattering ring and an ice speeder) the attractive women (although at least in the case of Jinx shes more of a partner/rival than a mere love interest) the globe-trotting (from North Korea to Hong Kong to Havana to London to Iceland) and the martinis (shaken not stirred). The villain Graves and his henchman Zao are unmemorable and their inevitable comeuppances are hardly the kind of moments to get audiences cheering. The opening theme is dreadful. Its a Madonna pop tune not a Bond song and its lack of musical consistency strikes a dissonant chord. (And as ""payment"" for providing such an awful piece of music Madonna gets to ""act"" in a cameo which unfortunately allows her to speak a few lines of dialogue.) David Arnolds score which makes liberal use of the ""James Bond Theme"" seems okay although most of it is drowned out by the explosions. Die Another Day features a few highlights the usual tour of Qs lab (with the inventor now being played by John Cleese who has the films single best line) a scene in which Bond and Moneypenny (Samantha Bond) virtually have the hottest encounter in their lengthy relationship and a high-energy sword fight between Bond and Graves. Other than that however Die Another Day is an exercise in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Its hard to blame Brosnan for this debacle although hes hardly at his most charismatic. The verve he displayed in his previous three outings is absent. This is an obligatory performance a the kind usually reserved for actors who have gotten tired of the role (Connery in Diamonds; Moore in Octopussy and A View to a Kill). Despite an energetic sex scene Jinx and Bond lack chemistry. Halle Berry may be an Oscar winner but that doesnt mean she can succeed as a Bond girl. Meanwhile Judi Denchs M has lost her edge; now shes just dour. Director Lee Tamahori (Once Were Warriors The Edge) may be to blame. Even though this anniversary movie supposedly contains something from each of the previous 19 outings (many of which appear as props in Qs lab) one gets the sense that Tamahori either doesnt understand Bond or has miscalculated the nature of his appeal. Its not enough to throw all of the Bond elements together and hope that they somehow work. A little more precision and craftsmanship are necessary (and a better script wouldnt have hurt things). Lets hope this represents an aberrance not a trend. If theres one thing to recognize its that a single bad outing will not succeed where Blofeld and dozens of other maniacs have failed. Whether played by Pierce Brosnan or someone else James Bond will return. Lets just hope that when he does hes the 007 we have come to love and admire not the impostor that inhabits Die Another Day.

James Bond celebrates his 40th birthday on the bigscreen in ""Die Another Day"" a midrange series entry that sports some tasty scenes mostly in the first half but also pushes 007 into CGI-driven quasi-sci-fi territory that feels like a betrayal of what the franchise has always been about. A gargantuan marketing push along with public curiosity about the heavily stressed Pierce Brosnan/Halle Berry pairing looks to ensure killer B.O. worldwide for this 20th ""official"" Bond entry. That producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and director Lee Tamahori intend to introduce a few new wrinkles to the time-tested formula is apparent even from the opening credits sequence which departs from the norm by mixing visual narrative elements in with the usual abstracted and gyrating female forms. What it shows are glimpses of Bond being tortured under incarceration by the North Koreans who in the arresting action prologue succeed in capturing the secret agent after he infiltrates a Communist camp in the demilitarized zone and his cover blown during an attempted trade of diamonds for weapons engages a hot-headed colonel in a wild chase aboard heavily armed hovercrafts. Fourteen months later Bond is still imprisoned with long locks and scraggly beard that makes him look like a young Alan Bates auditioning to play Jesus. That Bond finally gets out is no credit to him as hes released in a prisoner exchange and while the ""Castaway"" look results in a good laugh when the bedraggled former prisoner strides in among all the swells at the Hong Kong Yacht Club and asks for a room the net effect of the entire interlude is unsettling at least for Bond veterans of long-standing; while its daily routine for Bond to be thrown into immediate jeopardy never in memory has the character effectively been neutralized or put in a similar position of not being able to control his own fate. The process of neutering Bond is completed by M (Judi Dench of course) when she rescinds his license to kill and informs him that since hes suspected of having broken under interrogation (conducted under the effects of scorpion venom) ""Youre of no use to anyone now."" Intent to track down the North Koreans contact in the West Bond operating on his own heads for Cuba where he encounters not only Zao (Rick Yune) a fearsome terrorist whose face Bond bizarrely disfigured with little diamonds during the fracas in the demilitarized zone but the stunning Jinx (Berry). Bikini-attired and sporting a knife belt latter arises from the surf in a deliberate replay of Ursula Andress unforgettable entrance in ""Dr. No"" four decades back and strides right up to a waiting Bond who from the available evidence hasnt enjoyed the pleasure of female company in well over a year. Nothing can keep the brakes on these two but after a night of passion it becomes clear that Jinx is after Zao too on behalf on the Americans National Security Agency. Pic hits its stride for a time back in London with the entrance (via parasail over Buckingham Palace) of the central villain. Young handsome and outrageously wealthy Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens) passes himself off as a businessman to whom success just comes naturally but his snide arrogance betrays his true identity as yet another in a long line of Bond adversaries who wants to dominate the world. Adding to the sinister stature of his character Stephens contributes a measure of prepossessing physicality and aristocratic personal grit that makes Graves one of Bonds most worthy adversaries in a long time (Stephens is the son of Maggie Smith and the late Robert Stephens). Fact that the two men seem so equally matched is used to great advantage in an excellent extended sequence probably the films best in which the very competitive gents face off in a sporting duel at an elegant fencing club only to have the battle escalate to murderous levels as they pursue one another all over the premises. In a film overloaded with relatively routine and undifferentiated gunplay the blood sweat and muscle involved in this genuinely exciting combat are gratifyingly reminiscent of the most intense of all mano a mano Bond fights that between Sean Connery and Robert Shaw on the train in ""From Russia With Love."" But just when expectations are raised they quickly fade in the pics second half. Its as if screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade simply ran out of steam and the special effects team took over; the plot such as it is spins off its axis like an errant merry-go-round for the sake of some arbitrary and overly familiar action scenes. The obviously game Berry gets to recreate Connerys famous laser peril from ""Goldfinger"" but disappointingly has few further chances to spark with Bond. Most of the latter going is set in Iceland where Graves maintains an ""ice palace"" and has invited hundreds of his closest personal friends to witness a demonstration of his new space satellite with a reflector so strong that the orbiting craft will function as a second sun. In fact of course the device is the worlds most powerful weapon one that Graves is in cahoots with North Korea to impose on the free world. On a dramatic level follow-up to the nocturnal display prompts immediate head-scratching as all the other guests are suddenly gone the next morning. What are Bond and Jinx doing still hanging around and dont Graves and his henchmen find their continued presence suspicious? On the level of technique film ""Die Another Day"" goes way past any previous Bond into the realm of impossibility by introducing the agents stunning new Aston Martin Vanquish as a car that Q (John Cleese) has equipped with an invisibility option which Bond uses in an ice field car battle with Zao the latter in his new Jaguar (Jinx shows up in Iceland behind the wheel of a new T-Bird). But worse is a windsurfing escape by Bond from an ice avalanche that is so patently absurd and so blatantly a CGI concoction (especially in contrast to the stunning real surfing of the pictures opening sequence) that it proves a total turn-off. Even at their most outlandish the Bond films have usually made a point to keep the action at least on the outer edges of physical feasibility; Bonds innumerable conquests over peril over the years may not have been bloody likely but you could swallow them in context. These new bits with the car and avalanche are simply beyond the pale. Fiery airborne climax also has a computerized feel in part and is sufficiently protracted to prompt the feeling that this day has gone on long enough. There are momentary compensations along the way particularly in Bonds testy relationship with yet another beauty Miranda Frost (the Grace Kellyish Rosamund Pike) Graves publicist and a secret agent for M whos aptly named for her chilly demeanor and announced intention never to succumb to Bonds charms. Brosnan once again proves more than up to the task of filling Bonds shoes and especially in the early going gives the character some dark and nasty shadings that reveal a welcome desire to take Bond back to Ian Fleming-based basics. After the promising beginning unfortunately most of what Berry is called upon to do is pretty generic action stuff. Madonna who co-wrote and sings the banal title song does an unbilled cameo at the start of the fencing club scene. (At least shell be in one hit in 2002.) Aside from the jarring CGI material production values are up to series standards with locations in Cadiz Spain (doubling for Cuba) Iceland Norway Maui and the U.K. providing resplendent backdrops for the exotic action. Jump-framing of the introductions to certain scenes amounts to an annoying affectation that will date the film in the long run and sound mix at times allows the score and loud effects to battle rather than complement each other.

The movies sudden appearance on the other hand is nothing if not an act of film-exhibition intervention mere weeks before the ostensible beginning of a nonsensical war that like the last five decades worth of U.S.-led conflicts reflects only the self-preservative instincts of power. In taped footage shot as late as this past May Chomsky at 73 is calm and quick-minded as ever--ideally hed have his own weekly PBS hour of cant to quote casualty figures and burn through the many layers of carefully engineered U.S. propaganda. (As it is its surprising even this most media-loathed of dissidents hasnt been more tele-visible since his mini-transcript 9-11 became a bestseller.) The uninitiated heading to Film Forum might find it the best sawbuck theyve spent all year. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Chomsky himself hardly warrants a cult of personality--uncharismatic and reserved the man works hard at being merely the bearer of bad news. At the same time despite his reputation as a massively endowed brainiac or ""political philosopher"" Chomsky rarely writes or says anything that requires a Ph.D. to grasp. Rather he is a gimlet-eyed moralist with instant recall to whom ethical ground high and low is earned by action not rhetoric. A conscientious reading of newspapers (including the business press where Corporate America dares to be honest about its motives and tactics) is often all Chomsky requires to divine whats realpolitik for the average world citizen. This accumulation of cold facts results in an almost childishly simple perspective The survival and growth of power namely American leads eventually to the bulldozing of innocent citizenry. In the last year his position translates to questioning how the U.S. can be engaged in a ""war on terrorism"" when the mountains of civilian corpses weve left in Southeast Asia Central America the Mideast and western Africa qualify our most sanctimonious of nations as Champion Bullgoose Terror-Monger. Discussing September 11 2001 in Power and Terror Noam fires his rocket launcher from the hip ""This is an historic event but unfortunately not because of the scale or the nature of the atrocity but because of who the victims were."" (The irony marinating the ""historic"" is typically acidic.) American-born director John Junkerman keeps the proceedings determinedly no-frills (in contrast to the distractingly spiffy 1992 doc Manufacturing Consent) and only glancingly hagiographic focusing on taped lectures from Berkeley to the Bronx and on fresh interviews. Chomsky just talks about the deeply scarred Central American perspective on 9-11 the Eisenhower administrations documented understanding of the Arab worlds justified U.S.-hatred the hypocrisy of Turkeys dedication to anti-terrorism the press blackout on the 40th anniversary of our initial assault on South Vietnam the fact that the torture of 50000 or so Palestinians has been paid for by American tax dollars etc. Comparing U.S. slaughter abroad to the Al Qaeda attacks Chomsky simply asks us ""If one is right why is the other wrong?"" As he points out the presidents fave philosopher Jesus wouldve had to ask the same question. A conventionally orchestrated docu-history on the defunct German Democratic Republic Hava Kohav Bellers The Burning Wall treads the time line from the perspective of dissidents (most of them disillusioned Communists who began the post-war project with their anti-fascist fists in the air) and their harassers at Stasi the quasi-nations massive surveillance agency. Its estimated that almost a full third of the GDRs population was being monitored and reported on by an informant force nearly half as large. Within a few short years from the hopeful Stalinism of 1949 a rampaging mini-Soviet terror state was executing citizens imprisoning writers and by 1961 building a massive wall across Berlin to keep desperate East Germans from walking west. Following a few key figures (predominantly activist-scientist-bureaucrat Robert Havemann) Beller favors archival shots of children too heavily but scores with actual Stasi tapes and interviews with ex-commanders most of whom conspicuously avoid admitting remorse. The dynamic of rationalization and transferred guilt is stunning given the proximity of Nazism (how could so many stomach the GDRs use in the 50s of uniforms parades salutes and ubermensch-ism?). Just as surprising is the similarly craven sense displayed by many of the bureaucrat witnesses that the republics collapse lies in the safely distant past rather than a mere 12 years earlier. On the surface Bellers film is an acute primer on mid-century socialist statism gone inevitably screwy but beneath it theres something to be gleaned about the psychology of German nationhood. A Cold War artifact that died with Sean Connerys hair follicles but refuses to get buried James Bond returns again using North Korea as a convenient archvillain just as Bush II has. Die Another Day has a relatively grim first third (Bond is tortured by the NK military and after being traded for an evil thug with diamonds embedded in his face goes rogue to exact revenge) but thereafter the film descends into the usual deafening twaddle climaxing (for the first of three times) in what looks like a parking garage made of melting ice. The dialogue is pablum as always and the plot idiotic The smug mega-baddie (Toby Stephens) has spent apparent billions on a mirrored-laser satellite for the sole purpose of clearing mines from the Korean borders DMZ. Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid but when it has the temerity to run over two hours you feel like winding up with a kick.
