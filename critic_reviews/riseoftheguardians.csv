"Rise of the Guardians a holiday animation release thats DreamWorks weakest effort - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Rise of the Guardians fails to rise to holiday must-see status  1/2November 20 2012|By Roger Moore McClatchy NewspapersDreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg recently lamented the dearth of holiday-themed movies headed to your multiplex this year. But in foisting ""Rise of the Guardians"" upon unsuspecting audiences for the holidays its clear he just wanted to take some of the pressure off this joyless soul-dead piffle.""Guardians"" is the worst animated movie to ever wear the DreamWorks logo.Its based on William Joyces ""The Guardians of Childhood"" books about a team that includes Bunny the Easter mascot given an Aussie accent by Hugh Jackman here; North aka Santa made all Slavic and silly by Alec Baldwin; Tooth (Fairy voiced by Isla Fisher) and the silent roly-poly Sandman.They need the help of newcomer Jack Frost (Chris Pine) if theyre to have a prayer of stopping Pitch short for Pitch Black the night-terror voiced by Jude Law. Hes seeing to it that kids across the world are giving up their belief in magic and magical figures such as the Guardians. And hes giving them night terrors.All the Guardians have their public face and their commando side. When action is called for they team up to save childhood. Is Jack Frost worthy of their ranks? Hes an imp a bit of a rogue more into mischief than making the world safe for dreaming. He freezes this and that and makes with the mayhem. Kids who cant see him only his handiwork dont mind.North sees the threat that Pitchs ""touch of fear"" carries and summons his unruly troops. ""Now vee get down to tacks of brass"" he says in silly Slavic. Its amusing the way this guy swears using Russian composers names as profanity -- ""Shostakovich"" ""Rimsky-Korsakov""Bunny is more militant. He packs a boomerang and a chip on his kangaroo-sized shoulder.Its a confused ramble across some of the same ground covered by ""Arthur Christmas"" ""Monsters Inc."" and ""The Tooth Fairy."" This film is more concerned with the mechanics of how Santa manages to make all those toys -- he has zany nonspeaking Yeti and elf assistants -- than with telling an interesting story or giving the characters anything warm or funny to do. The assorted hummingbird-sized tooth fairy assistants are fascinating visually. But is there a message a lesson or a laugh in them? No.Was hiring David Lindsay-Abaire (""Rabbit Hole"" ""Inkheart"") really the wisest choice for writing the script?""Rise of the Guardians"" is harmless enough and the lack of easy pop-culture jokes represents the post-""Shrek"" direction of DreamWorks well enough. But this is the studios least entertaining film. For a company that banks on building franchises of kiddie cartoons from ""Shrek"" to ""Madagascar"" these Guardians dont rise to the occasion -- not by a long shot.Rise of the Guardians -- 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG (for thematic elements and some mildly scary action)Running time 137Opens Wednesday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesDreamWorks slips to loss as ""Guardians"" movie disappointsFebruary 26 2013Bookseller Irwin Rosen 93 Guardian Of Fine Books TraditionJune 30 1997A season of 3PEATSMay 6 2007Why Let Truth Spoil The Magic Of Childhood?December 27 1992Cholesterol test now recommended for kids 9 to 11March 14 2014Find More Stories AboutRiseChildhoodShrekToothTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-11-20/entertainment/sc-mov-1119-rise-of-the-guardians-20121121_1_guardians-rise-shrek,200,riseoftheguardians1,riseoftheguardians,chicagotribune

Despite a hectic storyline some hit-and-miss comedy and a hammer-it-home message that Santa et al do indeed exist (they do kids really they do) its still one of the most enjoyable festive family films of the past few years.First-time director Peter Ramseys sharp eye for detail is evident in the dazzling animation. The characters too are well rounded and mostly likeable none more so than the mute Yoda-like Sandman who wields the films prettiest special effects. Rise of the Guardians is an effervescent dose of fantasia thats pretty hard to dislike. Unless of course youre a cynical grump.

In 2D it would be a decidely average 2 star film. Throw in enough cliches to make the director of a regional panto blush and the obligatory British bad guy and we get a film that runs through the cliches of naff childrens films in that as long as one child believes there is hope. Behind a colourful and pretty exterior lies an empty vacuum of a film. Five out of ten if generous and the 3D lifts it a point to a poor but just about 3 star flick. Throw in Alec Baldwin wth the worst accent ever in a film means more laughs at the film than with it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/90545/rise-of-the-guardians.html,200,riseoftheguardians3,riseoftheguardians,timeout

Based on the novel by Yann Martel a young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. (Video amp; Photo 20th Century Fox) By Joe Morgenstern Nov. 22 2012 720 p.m. ET Hunger says the desperate hero in ""Life of Pi"" ""can change everything you think you knew about yourself."" So too can the ineffably beautiful images of Ang Lees film change what you think you knew about the appeal of monodramas (although the hero isnt really alone in the unfolding tale); about water (not what it is or what it can do but how it can look) and about the relatively new fast-evolving field of computer-generated imagery. Mr. Lees film is stronger as a visual experience--especially in 3-D--than an emotional one but it has a final plot twist that may also change what you thought you knew about the ancient art of storytelling. By now the commanding graphics of the trailers and print ads have established the premise of the narrative which was adapted by David Magee from Yann Martels celebrated novel. Following a shipwreck a young Indian named Pi Patel played remarkably well by Suraj Sharma finds himself sharing a lifeboat with a huge Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. How the two of them got there is the stuff of the preface which covers Pis childhood as the son of a Pondicherry zoo owner in an agreeably whimsical style that evokes ""Amelie"" then depicts the mid-Pacific disaster zoo animals and all with--high compliment coming--the intensity of ""The Black Stallion."" Another part of the preface slow and somewhat clumsy but essential to honoring the book involves a writer played by Rafe Spall interviewing the adult Pi who is portrayed by the always superb Irrfan Khan. ENLARGE Suraj Sharma Twentieth Century Fox Once the ship has been wrecked and sunk by an epic storm long stretches of the action are confined to the lifeboat (where the tiger as many have noted with reference to Alfred Hitchcocks ""Lifeboat"" plays the Tallulah Bankhead role). Pi does manage to build a fragile raft to keep his distance from his toothy companion for as long as he can. Still the all-too-intimate relationship between (vegetarian) man and (carnivorous) beast lies at the heart of the film and has its spiritual resonances as well as its practical and logistical fascinations. Spiritual resonances were what attracted the interviewer to his subject in the first place; specifically someone describing Pis ordeal as ""a story that would make you believe in God."" Maybe yes maybe no but at the very least the story makes you ponder such questions as the mutual empathy of souls Richard Parkers not excluded; the human will to survive and humanitys place in the global skein of life. One deeply moving moment comes when Pi a Hindu who has studied the Muslim and Christian faiths catches a fish kills it weeps for having killed it and says through his tears ""Thank you Lord Vishnu thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives."" Yet its the spectacle of Pis journey that makes the most lasting impression. Man and beast must work out an armed truce--first out of need then out of unstated respect. The tigers weapons are his teeth and claws; the man has his brain. ""Maybe Richard Parker cant be tamed"" Pi tells himself ""but with Gods will he can be trained."" Theres much more to marvel at in this production a whale breaching in the night immensely phosphorescent; a carnivorous island literally crawling with little meerkats (and almost submerged by a tsunami of symbolism); an assault by squadrons of flying fish and most marvelous of all the ocean. Has anyone before Ang Lee rethought the visual essence of water? What he and his cinematographer Claudio Miranda have done in several sequences is to treat water like a mirror a radiant medium that floats the lifeboat and its passengers on a glassy surface or to render it invisible a magical absence that suspends living creatures in a state of ecstatic grace. Ive waited until now to discuss the nature of the tiger which--or more properly who since hes such a vivid character--is the real thing in certain sequences but mainly a creature spawned by computers with bits and bytes where his strands of DNA ought to be. In one sense this fully believable CGI creation is a wonder of technology and a tribute to the current state of the animation arts. Yet the greater significance of Richard Parker is that hes fully integrated into the film and a tribute to the directors virtuosity. In ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" Mr. Lee pulled off a similar feat of integration--not with a tiger despite the title but with Chinese wire fighting that matched the elegance of the production as a whole. Here working from an intricately literary source he has visualized convincingly and completely a magical world in which a dying man clings to his planet and a tiger burns bright night and day. ENLARGE Anthony Hopkins as Alfred Hitchcock. Fox Searchlight Hitchcock ""Hitchcock"" rings false from start to finish. This lifeless botch was directed by Sacha Gervasi from John J. McLaughlins adaptation of a Stephen Rebello book about the making of ""Psycho."" Anthony Hopkins plays the legendary director whose reputation took some lurid hits in a recent TV movie that had him treating Tippi Hedren very badly during filming of ""The Birds."" The first time we see Mr. Hopkins as Hitch hes standing on the set of an ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" episode teacup in hand. ""Oh good evening"" he says straight to the camera as was Hitchcocks wont and the casting of a fine actor as a peerless filmmaker promises to be fun--a stunt certainly but maybe an enjoyable one. Watch a clip from the film ""Hitchcock."" A love story between filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) and wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren) during the filming of ""Psycho"" in 1959. Also starring Toni Collette. (Photo amp; Video Fox Searchlight) No such luck though. For openers Mr. Hopkins dials down the distinctive eccentricity of Hitchcocks accent which was so archly raffish or raffishly arch that it sometimes sounded like a speech impediment. Apart from a lovely private dance that this Hitchcock does in a theater lobby during the premiere of ""Psycho"" theres little joy in the portrayal that follows. And no wonder since the writing devoid of wit let alone wisdom reduces its subject to a little cluster of behaviors Hitchcock gorging boozing leering like a lecher peering like a peeping Tom while doubting the fidelity of his ever-faithful wife Alma. (Shes played by Helen Mirren who at least gets to focus her formidable energy on a good angry speech about his misplaced suspicions.) Alma more than her husband is the films reason for being. Hes full of self-doubt as ""Psycho"" goes into production ""Am I making a terrible mistake? What if its another Vertigo?"" (That line has an unintentional layer of irony since the British magazine Sight and Sound in the fullness of its unwisdom recently named ""Vertigo"" the best movie of all time.) ""Hitchcock"" is populated by faux-zircon representations of Hollywood power brokers of the period--a bland Lew Wasserman a defanged Barney Balaban--but the power behind Hitch is clearly his wife who not only shores up his sagging ego but takes his place on the set when hes too sick to direct and figures out during postproduction in the ""Psycho"" editing room how to save the shower scene. Now no one doubts the central role that Alma played in Hitchs life but the shower scene was never in need of saving and was surely not saved in postproduction by Alma or anyone else. (She did legend has it spot a moment when Janet Leigh blinked as the supposedly dead heroine and the offending frames were excised.) The dominant quality of Hitchcocks personality as an artist and a man was his drive for control and nowhere did that quality express itself more effectively than in the intricate planning of the shower scene that preceded the actual shooting. ""Hitchcock"" slashes that truth to tatters in the course of a larger crime against biography. ENLARGE The Easter Bunny and Santa Claus DreamWorks Animation Rise of the Guardians As ""Life of Pi"" demonstrates the sky is no longer the limit for computer animation. Watch ""Rise of the Guardians"" a computer-animated feature in vivid 3-D and youre caught up in soaring motion that knows no physical bounds. Whats more the kinetic energy is matched by stunning design and the story features multiple mythical heroes in a kid-friendly variant of ""The Avengers."" Still the movie may provoke a case of motion sickness--not the kind that causes nausea but a CGI-induced condition that leaves you slightly sick of all the swoopings swirlings and incessant chases and wishing everyone would occasionally settle down. Watch a clip from the animated film ""Rise of the Guardians."" When evil spirit Pitch (Jude Law) assaults Earth the Immortal Guardians team up to protect the innocence of children around the world. Also starring Chris Pine. (Photo amp; Video Paramount) The villain of the piece is a boogeyman named Pitch as in pitch black; hes voiced with amusing unctuousness by Jude Law. Pitchs push for global dominance is met by an ad hoc alliance of four prominent guardians of childrens welfare a surprising Santa brawny and tattooed with Alec Baldwin doing a hilarious Russian accent; an Easter Bunny whos closer to a kangaroo what with his boomerang and Hugh Jackmans Aussie accent; an iridescent and hummingbird-flighty Tooth Fairy whos given an endearingly earnest voice by Isla Fisher and shape-shifting Sandman whos mute--hes the Harpo of the group. A new recruit Jack Frost ( Chris Pine) is a winsome young flake with an identity crisis. ""Rise of the Guardians"" suffers from something akin to Jacks plight. From moment to moment it can be beguiling as in the intersection of Jack Frost a little boy named Jamie and the toy bunny the boy once loved. Yet the movie lacks a resonant center. The script seems to have been written by committee with members lobbying for each major character and the action set in vast environments all over the map spreads itself so thin that a surfeit of motion vitiates emotion. Think globally and dramatize locally should have been the watchword. DVD Focus ENLARGE Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000) When Ang Lees landmark martial-arts romance opened more than a decade ago I wrote that watching it felt like paradise regained--the kind of movie paradise we experienced as kids confronted by enchanting images bedazzling colors and miraculous beings who were exempt from the rules that govern everyday life. Chow Yun-fat is Li Mu Bai a master swordsman who has laid down his sword after decades of chivalric struggle. Michelle Yeoh is Yu Shu Lien the woman he loves. Zhang Ziyi is Jen Yu a pretty impulsive aristocrat who also happens to be a sword-fighter of almost mythic though covert ability. ENLARGE Tabu and Irfan Khan. Everett Collection The Namesake (2006) Irrfan Khan gives a magnificent performance opposite the Indian star Tabu; they play husband and wife who after an arranged marriage fly from New Delhi to the U.S. where they manage to raise an almost thoroughly American son--the namesake of the title--with the singular moniker of Gogol Ganguli. ( Kal Penn gives Gogol a charming goofiness that yields to endearing manhood.) Mira Nair directed this unusually pleasurable film which was adapted from the debut novel of the same name by Jhumpa Lahiri. (Mr. Khan also made an indelible impression as the nasty police inspector in ""Slumdog Millionaire."") ENLARGE Lust Caution Lust Caution(2007) Ang Lee meets Alfred Hitchcock in Mr. Lees long seductive yet almost thrill-free thriller set in Shanghai during the Japanese occupation of China in World War II. The heroine Wong Chia Chih (an impressive screen debut by Tang Wei) is a movie fan with a gift for acting that she discovered as a college student. Since her story resonates with ""Notorious"" and ""Suspicion"" were treated to fleeting Hitchcock clips. (The plot is also similar to Paul Verhoevens zestful ""Black Book."")

DreamWorks hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks Rise of the Guardians Director Peter Ramsey Genre Family Running time 97 minutes Rated PG for thematic elements and some mildly scary action With Hugh Jackman Alec Baldwin Isla Fisher Watch Clips Hes Still Awake Hes Still Awake Credit Paramount We Protect Them Credit We Protect Them William Joyces illustrated books for children are marvels of wit and wonder rendered in softly shaded colors with an art-deco flair. In books like A Day with Wilbur Robinson and Santa Calls winsome dinosaurs wear miniature fezzes on their tiny heads; a roly-poly Santa complete with monocle (the better to read the names of good little boys and girls) looks as if hes just stepped off a 30s Christmas card; and modes of transport include Buck Rogers-style spaceships and locomotives of the sort Superman could stop with his bare hands. Rise of the Guardians is adapted from Joyces book series The Guardians of Childhood. But the occasional Joycean touch aside it bears so little resemblance to the look and feel of its source material that it ought to be considered an entirely different beast. The story is convoluted and overly complicated In the opening we meet Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine) a skinny nonmortal with a shock of silvery Rod Stewart hair. Frost has been given a gift by the moon -- he can create snow and ice crystals with a wave of his crooked staff -- but hes been around for 300 years and he still doesnt know who he is or where he came from. Meanwhile a Santa Claus type known as North (Alec Baldwin) -- hes heavily tattooed and speaks with a thick Russian accent -- discovers that the Bogeyman aka Pitch (Jude Law) is alive and well and turning the dreams of children everywhere into nightmares zapping any sense of wonder right out of the little tykes. The crazed adventure that follows involves an Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) with an Australian accent a fluttery tooth-fairy princess (Isla Fisher) in an iridescent Rockettes unitard and a passel of little elf types in conical outfits skittering here and there underfoot. i Tooth and Jack Frost keep watch over Jamie (Dakota Goyo). DreamWorks hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks Tooth and Jack Frost keep watch over Jamie (Dakota Goyo). DreamWorks ""Skittering"" may be the operative word here Rise of the Guardians made by first-time director Peter Ramsey (who has been working for years as a storyboard artist) is too cluttered and manic to bring real pleasure. Theres barely a moment when someone or something isnt flying through the sky slipping on the ice or hippety-hopping down the bunny trail. And with a few notable exceptions the character design leaves much to be desired Many of them look more like Robert Zemeckis-style concoctions with semi-human eyes and waxy skin rather than Joycean creations. Thats a shame because the picture does have its share of marvelous semi-hallucinatory details like an army of pastel-colored Easter eggs marching along bumptiously on slender little legs; they have no faces so they look a little weird but wonderfully so. Guardians does feature one character who is pure Joyce Sandman is a diminutive football-shaped fellow with a button nose and twinkling eyes. Not only is he made entirely of golden glittery sand but he flies around in a little Busby Berkeley-style airplane also made of sand; his charm quotient is off the charts. Its notable though that Sandman doesnt speak Hes an oasis of calm in an otherwise extremely busy movie. Rise of the Guardians despite its good intentions doesnt trust children to sit still for a minute. So much for preserving their sense of wonder.

""There wasnt a mythology"" he explained in a radio interview last year. ""We have a mythology for Superman and Batman and the Green Lantern and all those guys yet the one group of fellows that we grew up believing in--actually believing in--have no unifying mythology.""So Joyce set about writing one. The result was his Guardians of Childhood series (consisting of two picture books and three novels to date) which in turn inspired the animated film Rise of the Guardians. Given that the movie was precipitated essentially by the question Why do we know more about Green Lantern than the Easter Bunny? its little coincidence that it takes the form of a childrens fable reimagined as a superhero flick. The surprise rather is that this peculiar but delightful hybrid just may be the best animated offering of the year. Related Story Wreck-It Ralph Aims for Pixar ... and Misses Here we are introduced to Santa as a massive Slav his Popeye-scale forearms tattooed Russian-mob-style ""Naughty"" and ""Nice."" (The voice served up with goodly portions of ham and relish is by Alec Baldwin.) Joining St. Nick are Bunnymund (Hugh Jackman) an oversized rabbit from Down Under with a penchant for pastel eggs; Tooth (Isla Fisher) and her army of humming-bird-ish dental retrievers; and the Sandman a doughy yet doughty keeper of dreams silent as Harpo Marx. Following an aurora-borealic summons the four gather at Santas polar citadel--its hard to imagine that the Fortress of Solitude echoes are unintentional--where he reminds them ""It is our job to watch over the children of the world and keep them safe."" As he speaks his fellow Guardians survey a huge spinning globe that pinpoints every one of their young charges (yes this is Santas Situation Room); across it a wave of darkness is spreading.This would be the shadow cast by diabolical fear-god Pitch known to kids everywhere as the Boogeyman and to you and me as Jude Law. After a long absence he has returned to haunt the Earths children in their slumbers transmuting the gold-dust-unicorn dreams supplied by the Sandman into snarling hell-horse nightmares. Clearly reinforcements are called for and one is quickly summoned in the form of Jack Frost (Chris Pine) a teenager frozen in time and longstanding Naughty-lister who is chosen by the Man in the Moon to become the newest Guardian. Santas elves blare celebratory bugles his yeti (didnt know about them did you?) twirl torches like majorettes and all the customary ceremonies are observed. And then theyre off these newly assembled heroes. The fate of Easter--what if the egg hunt finds itself without prey?--lies in the balance.As is no doubt apparent theres more than a whiff of The Avengers to the entire undertaking. Pitchs toffee-nosed inflections and air of needy malevolence--wont someone please play attention to him--bear a notable resemblance to Lokis Asgardian envy and bad-boy Jack Frost flashes more than a hint of that Tony Stark spark. It can hardly escape notice that Bunnymund is yet another overgrown rodent voiced by the man behind Marvel-universe colleague Wolverine. And Santa? Well if Thor spent a bit of time hanging out with dockworkers in Murmansk grew out his beard and put on a couple of pounds.... Im just saying.There are marvels around every corner from Bunnymunds Wonka-worthy Easter warren to Santa cloud-surfing his sleigh.If all of this makes Rise of the Guardians sound rather silly well it is. (Obviously.) But while there are times when the plot is packed rather more densely than is strictly speaking necessary there are moments of genuine magic scattered throughout the script--by Pulitzer-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire--as when Santa uses nesting dolls to illustrate the ""wonder"" at his core or Jack discovers how it is that he came to be Jack Frost. First-time director Peter Ramsay keeps the plot-lines taut and Baldwin and Law stand out amid the strong vocal cast. But what ultimately elevates the film above the ordinary is its extravagant visual imagination--a quality perhaps to be expected given the participation in addition to Joyce of executive producer Guillermo del Toro and ""visual consultant"" Roger Deakins. There are marvels around every corner from the lavish moustaches of the yuletide yeti to Pitchs Dementor-like steeds trailing tendrils of fear; from Bunnymunds Wonka-worthy Easter warren to the lazily ambling dream-world apatosaurs; from the Sandman cracking his long nebular whips to Santa cloud-surfing his sleigh slashing through bad dreams with a cutlass in each meaty fist. Its enough to inspire a holiday carol.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Its all been done. Santa has been played by the likes of Tim Allen and Paul Giamatti. Hes had problems with overgrown elves (Will Ferrell in Elf) and recalcitrant brothers (Vince Vaughn in Fred Claus). Hes been forced into marriage (Santa Clause 2) and working retail (Miracle on 34th Street). Robert Zemeckis (The Polar Express) and Aardman Animation (Arthur Christmas) both walloped him with high tech. But I am not sure that he has ever wielded a scimitar in each hand while speaking like a Russian gangster as he does in DreamWorks Animations highly contrived and often confusing Rise of the Guardians which is adapted from childrens book author and Robots production designer William Joyces Guardian series. Voiced by Alec Baldwin this Santa character (called North) has bigger troubles than toy delivery. He has to go to war with a Voldemort-like boogeyman named Pitch (Jude Law) in order to save childhood innocence and to do so he needs the help of the mythical Guardians. They include the treacle-sweet Tooth (Isla Fisher) the cocky Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) and the Sandman (voiced by no one; hes kind of a mime). (READ About the time Hugh Jackman hugged TIMEs Joel Stein) But the usual suspects arent enough. Pitch is desperate for attention--supposedly no one believes in the boogeyman anymore although the popularity of the Paranormal Activity series would suggest otherwise--and begins to cast a dark mood over children everywhere. The Man in the Moon recommends the Guardians add reinforcements in the form of mischief-maker Jack Frost (Chris Pine). Hes a surprise choice; the kids dont believe in Jack Frost if theyve ever heard of him. Poor Jack. If hes lucky maybe hell get a mention from a mom instructing her kid to put on a coat lest Jack Frost nip at his or her nose or fingers and toes. Enter the reluctant fifth Guardian; the Hulk in this kiddie version of The Avengers. Pitchs first nefarious act is to steal all the teeth collected by Tooth and capture all her little tooth minions making it impossible for her to continue to collect baby teeth in the interim. On Norths mega globe the lights representing belief immediately begin to go out. Without cash for canines faith is no more. And its April so Bunny is the next threatened Guardian. (READ Mary Pols review of Isla Fishers Bachelorette) There is cinematic precedent for Santa hanging with the other representatives of all  major holidays involving gifts candy or money. He had some dealings with the ""Council of Legendary Figures"" in the Santa Clause movies including all of the above plus Mother Nature Father Time and Cupid. Jack Frost was the outsider in that scheme as well (Martin Short played him as a saboteur in Santa Clause 3). In Norse legends Jokul Frosti was downright dangerous. In this incarnation hes about 12 years-old a barefoot sprite with grey hair cute and kind of like a miniature Richard Gere. Jack is bound to be a hit with boys in the audience especially after Rise of the Guardians best sequence in which Jack takes a still-believing boy sledding at top speed through quintessential small-town America. The character feels fresh and new re-imagined as someone kids can relate to and ultimately (no spoilers) proves to have a bittersweet back story. On his own Jack could carry a movie. Instead the movie directed by Peter Ramsey a longtime art department guy making his feature film debut grinds through various machinations to make Jack a member of this fraternity. As for the business of having the Tooth Fairy develop a crush on Jack simpering while she paws at him? Creepy and no way to protect childhood innocence. (Id take Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in a tutu over this twit any day.) Joyces Guardian series takes place 300 years prior to the action in this story which was written and tailored specifically for the movie is old fashioned and beautifully illustrated and some of that translates to screen. Tooth and her minions depicted as pretty little hummingbirds could be the realization of the great illustrator Arthur Rackham. But the Sandman drawn to look like an amber-colored Pikachu and giving off the sunny glow of Harpo Marx is a dud. And his presence feels unnatural especially without any reference to his current obscurity. The movie depicts Jack Frost as being forgotten by the current generation but come on the Sandman? While Pat Ballards song from 1954 with its lyrics ""bring me a dream"" prolonged in the Sandman mythology were two generations removed from Sandman days. Modern children tend go to sleep to the sounds of whales or white noise with nary a mention of the Sandman. (READ How much TIMEs critic loved the Star Trek reboot starring Chris Pine) Hes unlikely to be resuscitated because of his appearance in Rise of the Guardians even though he perhaps more than any of the other characters is portrayed as a key player in the violent battle climax. The narrative choice hand-to-hand combat and a showdown in the streets in order to save children from cynicism and non-believing is ironic but hardly surprising; like most childrens movies Rise of the Guardians mimics the patterns of adult entertainment. Where is the magic in that? Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009. She has degrees from Duke University where she studied art history and the University of California Berkeleys School of Journalism. She is the author of a memoir about untraditional parenthood.

Taking their cues from the unseen Man in the Moon they protect children everywhere from evildoers. Theres also a really tired concept dragging down the film namely that new Guardians recruit Jack Frost isnt sure that he wants to join up and he doesnt know who he really is -- and hes basically the umpteenth Joseph-Campbell-reluctant-hero who pops up in seemingly every kids movie and superhero epic. (Arguably ""Guardians"" is both.) And as much as I often found myself enchanted by this 3D animated film based on the series of books by William Joyce I couldnt help noticing that this movie falls into a conundrum I like to call (with a tip of the hat to playwright Christopher Durang) ""You didnt clap loud enough -- Tinkerbells dead."" As an atheist (albeit one who loves Christmas movies) I get a little twitchy about films where children are made to feel guilty about not believing in things and people that dont actually exist. So even though its nice to get a non-cynical story aimed at kids in which open-heartedness and wonder are celebrated as virtues this is another movie that paints itself into a theological corner by suggesting that those of us who question the existence of the Easter Bunny are at fault for all the worlds ills. In this tale the Guardians assemble for two reasons to welcome Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine) into their ranks and to combat Pitch Black (Jude Law) a long-suppressed boogeyman whos out to capture the Sandman (who never speaks but is one of the movies funniest characters) and to replace his golden slumbers with hideous nightmares. Santa (Alec Baldwin) -- here made out to be the jolliest Russian stevedore on Earth -- welcomes Jack to the fold and assures him that he can be a hero once he figures out what hes made of. Less convinced is the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) who has ongoing resentment against Jack for all those times that wintry weather has disrupted egg hunts. And theres the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) who subcontracts most of her gig out to her army of pixies; one of the films interesting twists is to explain why childrens teeth are so valuable and what she does with them. When the Guardians are zipping around the planet invisibly enchanting children and ribbing each other ""Rise of the Guardians"" has a real lift to it; first-time director Peter Ramsey knows how to pace the big set pieces and he understands that anytime you can make characters fly around (or extreme-sled) in a 3D movie audiences spirits will soar too. All too often however the good stuff is interrupted by the extremely pat plot beats of Jack and his voyage of self-fulfillment and those arent the only mistakes screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire (""Rabbit Hole"") makes along the way. Theres a major plot development that takes place off-camera which gives a large chunk of the movie a ""Wait what just happened?"" confusion thats too much of a distraction. The younguns at the screening I attended were entranced for much of ""Rise of the Guardians"" (terrible title) so parents can rest assured that its target audience will leave satisfied. But the best family films truly appeal to the whole family and adults may find themselves asking and fending off too many questions to take the plunge into this fantasy universe.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 21 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Nov. 20 2012 644PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Peter Ramsay Written by David Lindsay-Abaire Starring Alec Baldwin Chris Pine Hugh Jackman Ilsa Fisher (voices) Country USA Language English If Pixar has positioned itself as the classy Fred Astaire of animated films the studios main rival in the feature-length cartoon business DreamWorks Animation is the sassy brassy Gene Kelly. Now the studio behind the wisecracking Shrek Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar franchises enters the holiday season unopposed in the childrens market and DreamWorks seems to have taken a page from Pixars playbook A tale of a plucky outsider on an identity quest. Film Rise of the Guardians Official Trailer The hero is Jack Frost a minor figure in the childrens pantheon who awakened 300 years ago under a sheet of ice. Now hes a skateboarding globe-hopping hoodie-wearing adolescent experiencing an existential crisis. Though he spends his time happily enough flitting about and invisibly playing winter games with groups of children in the snow he wonders where he came from and what his purpose in life could be. And whats the point of being magic if no one recognizes you?These questions get answered when Jack is summoned to join the Guardians a team of supernatural beings committed to protecting the worlds children sustained reciprocally by childrens belief in them. The leader of course is Santa Claus only in this version he has the build of a retired pro wrestler who speaks with a Russian accent (voiced by Alec Baldwin) with the words ""naughty""and ""nice"" tattooed on his brawny forearms. He goes by the name ""North."" His fellow guardians include the ninja bunny E. Aster Bunnymund (Hugh Jackman) and the fairy Tooth (voiced by Isla Fisher). Finally theres the golden bearish Sandy the Sandman.Collectively the Guardians are threatened by the bogeyman a.k.a. Pitch Black (Jude Law) who looks and sounds like an English punk rocker and has a similar penchant for anarchy and bad teeth. Pitch wants to return the world to the Dark Ages and unleash his ""night mares"" - wraith-like flying black horses. Jack and his handy wooden staff must stop Pitch from thwarting the gathering of lost teeth and the annual distribution of Easter eggs. In the process he learns about his origins and accepts his destiny.All this feels formulaic and the believe-in-magic message is even more treacly than typical but give first-time feature director Peter Ramsey credit for his visual panache. Rise of the Guardians is a glittering study in architectural spaces from Norths amphitheatre-sized workshop to the imaginative chase sequences with Easter eggs on feet running through Bunnys global tunnel system. From time to time as Alexandre Desplats insistent score surged yet again while the characters rushed by I found myself wanting the movie to slow down. Some of these images are too beautiful to disappear so quickly.

DreamWorks Animation Santa Claus is armed. The Easter Bunny has an Aussie accent. Jack Frost is a bit of a juvenile delinquent the Sandman is mute and the Tooth Fairy is a cross between a pretty ditz and a hummingbird. These are some definitely fractured fairy tales. They have wit and snap though and they breathe a good deal of real life into ""Rise of the Guardians"" a new 3-D film inspired by the lovely books by William Joyce. (And not overwhelmed parents to be confused with ""Legend of the Guardians"" the 2010 film about talking owls.) In this world the five good-guy characters -- Jack is the newest addition -- are in charge of protecting the hopes of children. But they draw their power from the little ones belief -- and once the Boogeyman sets out to shake that faith the weakened warriors have to fight back fast. The script by playwright David Lindsay-Abaire -- who wrote both the deadly serious ""Rabbit Hole"" and the goofy ""Shrek The Musical"" -- feels a little forced in spots as if there were certain kiddie-cinema sweetspots he felt (or was told) he had to hit. So Jack Frost is like most childrens-film heroes a misfit who needs to find his place and suffers a (not-quite-motivated) misunderstanding in the second act he has to recover from. There are also the obligatory cute little supporting characters just begging to be made into plush toys. Still thanks to its animators and its voice cast the film has plenty of nice touches. Theres Alec Baldwins Santa who seems more Cossack than Claus throwing around swords and swearing (although his startled oaths run along the mild lines of ""Rimsky-Korsakov"") Or Hugh Jackmans Down Under bunny who carries a pair of formidable boomerangs. Hes the one poorly drawn character in the bunch crude and caricaturish like Bugs even ruder cousin. But Jude Laws Boogieman is marvelous the sort of a slithery black-clad snake-faced figure that only a Lord Voldemort could love. And best of all is the Sandman who brings children sweet dreams -- a golden gentle silent half-pint with the childlike resilience (and occasional impatience) of Harpo Marx. The story has surprising layers too. The Bunnys background seems to come courtesy of Jackman but it makes sense -- Australia was once seriously overrun with rabbits. (And when we see his home -- full of almost pagan architecture -- that sort of fits too as his legend isnt rooted so much in Christianity as it is in old fertility symbols). And why shouldnt Santa Claus -- with his love of winter huge fur coats and gorgeous sleigh with tiny tinkling bells -- be a son of most glorious Mother Russia? Or Jack Frost who brings slippery streets and iced-shut locks be a mischievous prank-playing boy? Or the Boogeymans fearsome nightmares take punning shape as dark horses? Most children of course wont give a thought to any of this. But its all proof of how much thought actually went into this. And one of the reasons that ""Rise of the Guardians"" is such a satisfying holiday treat for adults and children alike. Ratings note The film contains a few scary scenes. Rise of the Guardians (PG) Paramount (97 min.) Directed by Peter Ramsey. With the voices of Alec Baldwin Hugh Jackman Jude Law. Now playing in New Jersey.

Rise of the Guardians Santa leads an all-star team in the Rise of the Guardians By Jody Mitori jmitoripost-dispatch.com314-340-8240 Jody Mitori Nov 21 2012 (...) Dreamworks The Sandman the Easter Bunny Santa Claus the Tooth Fairy and Jack Frost in ""Rise of the Guardians."" Dreamworks Jack Frost Nicholas St. North the Sandman the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny in DreamWorks Animations ""Rise of the Guardians."" ""Rise of the Guardians"" is like an ""Avengers"" for the grade-school set an all-star gang of iconic characters from childhood.Santa Claus aka North (voiced by Alec Baldwin) leads this dream team but he doesnt act like the jolly man at the mall. The burly Russian with tattooed arms wields two swords and runs a command center where he can monitor kids around the world. Norths fellow Guardians are the flittering Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) the silent Sandman and a not-so-cuddly Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman who is more Indiana Jones than Peter Rabbit).The Guardians mission is to watch over all children. The four have been summoned by the Man in the Moon to fight Pitch (a wicked Jude Law) a spirit who wants to fill the world with darkness. He plots to make kids stop believing in the Guardians which would render the legends powerless. But the Man in the Moon wants to add one more player to the team Jack Frost (Chris Pine). With his hoodie spiky hair and nagging amnesia Jack is like a teen Jason Bourne. When Tooth promises to investigate Jacks early life he signs on to help the group. Like other superhero teams some of the Guardians have more appeal than others. Not surprisingly North and Bunny (and their respective workshop and warren) fare better than Tooth or Sandman. Jack is just right as the young member struggling to find his place.The film from first-time director Peter Ramsey has moments of real sadness especially when it comes to Jacks back story and the fate of one of the Guardians. The movie is based on a series by author William Joyce whose Oscar-winning short ""The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore"" also had more substance than most animated films. But kids will focus on the adventure the wondrous settings and the fun in seeing their idols on screen together. The Guardians make a winning team that is a prime candidate for a sequel just like ""The Avengers.""What ""Rise of the Guardians""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 129  Content Thematic elements and some mildly scary action Rise of the Guardians Three stars out of four Rating    PG Run time    129 Content    Thematic elements and some mildly scary action Tags Rise Of The Guardians William Joyce Alec Baldwin Hugh Jackman Jude Law Isla Fisher Jody Mitori North Jody Mitori Jody Mitori is assistant managing editor features for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Because the sepulchral Bogeyman called Pitch is dispatching nightmares (literally black horses) to disrupt the rugrats sleep. The last line of defense is the cabal of jolly night visitors. On paper it sounds like the Most Calculated Holiday Movie Ever. In execution the animated film inspired by William Joyces ""The Guardians of Childhood"" storybooks is enchanting. The shaggy whimsical characters have a primal familiarity as though they were developed by a tag team of Maurice Sendak and Walt Disney. Jack Frost (voice of Chris Pine) an adventurous youth with a SK8er Boi attitude and a shock of snowy hair has been dispatched by the Man in the Moon to the North Pole. Thats where North a Russian-accented Santa voiced by Alec Baldwin carves ice sculptures in the off-season. (His forearms are tattooed with ""Naughty"" on his left and ""Nice"" on his right.) Norths retainers are Yeti who chatter a language known only to them. Jack Frost is not his only visitor. There is the urbane boomerang-toting Bunny (Hugh Jackman) whos concerned because the long shadow of Pitch (Jude Law) - rendered as storm clouds that rain iron filings - threatens to preempt Easter. There is the giggly hummingbird-like Tooth (Isla Fisher) like Tinkerbell dressed in iridescent butterfly raiment. And there is Sandman a sand sculpture. He doesnt speak but rather communicates through thought balloons. Jack new to these parts doesnt quite know what hes doing among childhoods Fantastic Four. But when Pitch comes to make mischief Jacks skill with his Excalibur-like staff neutralizes the gloomy disturber of sleep. What Jack does not initially realize but the audience does is that his arrival means that the Fantastic Four are about to become the Fantastic Five of childhood superheroes. The film makes great use of 3-D to surround the audience with snow and take them down the Easter Bunnys warren. The joy of Peter Ramseys clever and well-paced film is how it maintains its focus on the experience of childhood wonder rather than on holiday loot. Christmas gifts and candy and money for teeth are nonfactors here. Jacks first encounter with a human kid Jamie is to take him on a thrill ride through the snow on a sled. That feeling of exhilaration and fun stays with you throughout this perfectly scaled film destined to become a classic.

"Rise of the Guardians review Headed for cult status | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRise of the Guardians review Headed for cult statusRise of the Guardians seems destined to become not so much an instant holiday classic as an eventual holiday cult film.It may take time to appreciate the pleasures of Bunnymund (the Easter Bunny) and North (Santa Claus) in Rise of the Guardians.  (DreamWorks Animation)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Nov. 21 2012Rise of the Guardians (out of 4)An animated Christmas adventure featuring the voices of Alec Baldwin Hugh Jackman Jude Law Chris Pine and Isla Fisher. Directed by Peter Ramsey. 97 minutes. Opens Nov. 21 at major theatres. GRise of the Guardians in which childhood dreams unite to fight a terrible nightmareseems destined to become not so much an instant holiday classic as an eventual holiday cult film.It seems almost grinchy to say anything negative about it because it gets so many of the fundamentals right. The artwork is distinctive -- Santa with tattoos -- and superbly drawn. The voice team is A-list and amusing. Composer Alexandre Desplat (The Tree of Life) contributes a highly emotive and effective score. The 3D is unnecessary but not unwelcome.Article Continued BelowYet this directing debut by storyboard artist Peter Ramsey feels patchy and too reliant on the ""need to believe"" hook it has brazenly lifted from Peter Pan. I suspect these objections will fade over time similar to how The Polar Express gradually found an audience.William Joyces The Guardians of Childhood book series plus his short film The Man in the Moon provide the impetus for a script by David Lindsay-Abaire (Robots) that has a lot of fun reconjuring the heroes of childhood. Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin) speaks with a Russian accent he carries two swords and he has tattoos on his forearms reading ""naughty"" and ""nice."" Forget elves -- this Santa has Yeti stooges for bodyguards.The Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) is thunder from Down Under. He has a shoulder belt that looks like it contains grenades he carries (and hurls) a mean boomerang and he speaks like a crabby Crocodile Dundee.A friendlier presence is the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) who is more like a brightly coloured bird. She has insect-sized helpers for her nightly task of collecting tiny molars and placing coins under pillows.Strangest of all is the silent Sandman my personal favourite who reminds me of the antic energy of Harpo Marx.Together they are the Guardians (""It is our job to protect the children of the world"") but they work under something of a Faustian deal. For the Guardians to function kids have to keep believing in them. These celestial good guys will cease to exist if the small fry lose faith.And thats a real possibility thanks to a dark entity called Pitch (Jude Law) who is tired of the Guardians claiming there is no Bogeyman. ""Its your turn not to be believed in"" he bellows as he commandeers the tooth trade and supplants sweet dreams with frightful sleeplessness.Enter Jack Frost (Chris Pine) a character midway between good and bad who has a troubled past and a confused present. He enjoys making cold and snow which annoys adults but also creates the lovely snow days for kids to get out of school. Whose side will Jack take in the war of light vs. dark? Can enough kids or maybe just one continue believing in the Guardians?You require no pixie dust to divine the answers. But youll perhaps need a little patience to fully appreciate Rise of the Guardians which is likely to grow in stature over time.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"What if Santa and Jack Frost joined forces? - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate What if Santa and Jack Frost joined forces? Share Tweet Share Tweet By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent | 11.20.12 | 346 PM If we want to slap a handy tag on Hollywoods popcorn output for 2012 ""Year of the Crossover"" might be it. Weve had flagship superhero characters join forces in ""The Avengers"" video game mainstays collide in ""Wreck-It Ralph"" a classic-monster mash in ""Hotel Transylvania."" And to close things out -- what else? -- a 3-D animated dream-teaming of Santa Claus the Easter Bunny the Tooth Fairy and a few lesser icons of kiddie wonderment in ""Rise of the Guardians."" Happily theres no cynicism to the ""Guardians"" concept no prevailing creative attitude of ""Hey how about a holiday franchise we can tap year round?"" Childrens lit author and illustrator William Joyce (""Rolie Polie Olie"") credits the idea for the source books to his late daughter and her youthful curiosity about whether the Tooth Fairy and Santa knew each other. (Awfully similar M.O.s after all.) And the movie doesnt just coast on familiar Christmas and Easter lore but instead puts Jack Frost at the center of its adventure. The character might generally register as just something to fill out the ""25 Days of Christmas"" lineup on ABC Family but the movie works hard to make him you know DreamWorks-legit. (They might also have worked on a title that seems like its bound to have brand-recognition issues with 2010s owl-themed ""Legend of the Guardians"" but we quibble.) Related Links Find showtimes and theaters for Rise of the Guardians Find showtimes and theaters for Rise of the Guardians 3D We meet hoodie-sporting Jack (Chris Pine) straight off in visually showy scenes that establish his gifts for artfully frosting window panes and flying around laying down fierce sled trails. But hes also established as a sad figure with no memory of his past and no understanding of why other kids cant see him. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Jacks mischievous melancholy wanderings are intercut with dire happenings up at the North Pole. Cossack-accented Santa a.k.a. North (Alec Baldwin broad as can be) learns that Pitch (Jude Law playing bogeyman) is making a power play for control of childrens dreams. Time to gather their legendary protectors the Guardians. Theres buff-and-tough Bunny (Hugh Jackman mining his Aussie accent as a setup for kangaroo jokes); hummingbird-like Tooth (Isla Fisher); and the pint-size Sandman a silent character whose power to dispatch morphing tendrils of golden stardust is a standout genuinely magical effect. Jack is the rookie the one theyll all learn about even as he learns about himself. The movies bid for distinctiveness works in lots of little ways the Tooth Fairys expanded mythology a running joke about yetis doing all the work for those dunderheaded elves the ""Naughty"" and ""Nice"" tats on Norths burly forearms. In a way though the various narrative curlicues come at the expense of more aggressively pushing the big gimmick. ""This is the best part"" Jack is told as hes initially inducted into the group -- but isnt that obvious? Maybe not given the storys occasional soft-sell tendencies. Still this does seem to leave room for bigger bolder more momentous adventures down the line (as the coda -- and Joyces growing book line -- apparently promise). Just a little something for the kids to put on their Christmas lists for holidays to come. Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet By far the most interesting element of Rise Of The Guardians--an animated film inspired by William Joyces Guardians book series--is a sequence where antagonist Pitch Black (Jude Law) attempts to recruit protagonist Jack Frost (Chris Pine) as an ally and companion. In that moment its immensely clear that the hero has more in common with the villain than he does with his fellow heroes; theyre both frustrated disenfranchised outsiders with exactly the same goals. Only their methods differ. Admirably their similarities arent limited to that scene either; they run throughout the film giving it nuance and a hint of thoughtfulness. But while Rise Of The Guardians boasts a great deal of visual energy and amounts to a lot of fun its mostly lacking in that kind of depth elsewhere. The film starts with Jack Frost being born out of a frozen lake bereft of memories or purpose; he quickly discovers his frost-making abilities in a giddy joyous rush but still doesnt understand who he is or why he came into being. Three hundred years later hes come to grudging sometimes resentful terms with a handful of other conceptually scattershot entities including the Easter Bunny (tribal-tattooed kick-ass and for some reason voiced by Hugh Jackman at his Aussie-est) the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) the Sandman (a mute beatific figure) and especially North (Alec Baldwin) a tattooed bluffly warm Russian take on Santa Claus. Then the Man In The Moon silently communicates that Jack is meant to join the other four as a Guardian a protector of childrens innocence worldwide--just as Pitch a.k.a. the Boogeyman attempts to blot out their belief in the Guardians altogether and usher in a new Dark Age. While the plot sounds cloyingly precious somewhere between one of Rankin-Bass sweet old origins-of-holidays TV specials and a Care Bears cartoon longtime animator and first-time director Peter Ramsey stages the action beautifully. In particular the Sandmans execution of dreams suggests a strong awareness of Hayao Miyazaki though with a revved-up American sensibility and a strong winning appreciation of 3-D space. (Roger Deakins role as a visual consultant says a lot about the filmmakers commitment to dazzling cinematography.) And the film has an odd spiritual flavor with the Man In The Moon representing a benign distant God--Jack is constantly trying to divine his will and being frustrated over his refusal to communicate--while Pitch makes a sleek urbane deliciously chilling Lucifer the type of devil who sees God as an adversary in a cosmic game and whos perfectly willing to buy souls if anyones selling. That big picture is at odds with Rise Of The Guardians overcrowded aesthetic which sometimes seems to cram every other frame full of wacky minions and eye-popping inventions for sheer love of spectacle and sometimes because theyd make eminently marketable toys. At least all the subsidiary business is enjoyably distracting as Guardians attempts to flesh out that bog-standard good-vs.-evil plotline into something more uniquely textured. In the end the film relies too heavily on deus ex machina to earn its emotions or its resolution. But it does fairly earn rapt attention for a solid percentage of its gloriously frantic runtime.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday November 21 2012 600 AM Title Rise of the Guardians Film Info PG Bad-dream-worthy images. Area theaters. ""Darkness - thats the first thing I remember"" says Jack Frost in the creepy mostly charmless ""Rise of the Guardians."" Its likely to be the main thing kids remember too about this dour animated adventure that aspires to holiday joy but is as enjoyable as a sock full of coal. Here Jack (voiced by Chris Pine) is one of several creatures who are both mythical and real. Jack throws snowballs at schoolchildren and is responsible for snow days. Yet Jack is lonely; when the all-powerful Man in the Moon turned him supernatural 300 years earlier he also made Jack invisible. His fellow folklore favorites can see him though. Nicholas St. North (Alex Baldwin) aka Santa leader of the ""Guardians of Childhood"" recruits a reluctant Jack to help defeat the ""nightmare king"" Pitch Black better known as the Boogeyman (Jude Law). Helping in the quest are the tough E. Aster Bunnymund (Hugh Jackman) better known as the Easter Bunny; the flitty sprite Toothiana (Isla Fisher) commander of an army of tiny tooth fairies; and the silent Sandman who brings happy dreams. Sandman may have his work cut out for him with audiences under 7. Pitchs demon horses are out to make nightmares real (and permanent) and the makers of this CG-animated middling 3-D film never find the proper mix of whimsy and danger. Often they settle on an overly macabre tone that obliterates a sense of wonder. Based on a kids book series by William Joyce ""Guardians"" is a hodgepodge of myths and legends that resembles a sweet-toothed version of ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" Theres so much plot that grade-schoolers may need to take notes. Teeth taken by the Tooth Fairy contain childhood memories. Believing in Jack makes small-town kids able to see him. But what about the little girl who wanders into Easterland and is soon forgotten the Yeti who work for Santa and the lack of nice dreams during the Dark Ages. Will all that be on the test? Only the voice work has punch. Baldwin hides his usual purr behind a cranky Cossack imitation Jackman plays up his Aussie spunk and Law takes obvious delight in mellifluous menace. Pines boyish enthusiasm occasionally breaks through Jack Frosts irksome puckishness. But as a group the characters grate. The gruff tattooed Santa would fit in on ""Sons of Anarchy"" and his rivalry with the Easter Bunny is as memorable as a cereal box promotion. Only the Sandman with his Harpo Marx-like pantomime shines and hes out of the movie for a chunk of time. Maybe hes working overtime to assure that ""Rise of the Guardians"" doesnt freak kids out - while helping parents doze through this mess.

Starring Chris Pine Hugh Jackman Alec Baldwin Director Peter Ramsey Running time 137 Release Opened Nov 21 2012  Editorial Review Scaring up magic from childhoodBy Michael OSullivanWednesday November 21 2012Thoughts become things. Thats the message of ""Rise of the Guardians"" a charming if slightly dark and cobwebbed animated feature about how believing in something makes it real or real enough. That theme is a bit of storytelling DNA that the movie loosely based on William Joyces picture books ""The Guardians of Childhood"" cribs from both ""Peter Pan"" and ""The Velveteen Rabbit."" Its hardly grand larceny. The idea is an old one yet ""Rise of the Guardians"" takes it and makes it its own. Its a lovely and original tale. The question of whats real or not here revolves around a group of venerable protective spirits called the Guardians Santa Claus known as North (Alec Baldwin); the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman); the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher); and the Sandman who never speaks. Collectively they are what gets those of us of a certain age through the night. The arrival of a young fifth spirit Jack Frost (Chris Pine) sets the story in motion. Or rather the arrival of the Bogeyman known as Pitch Black (Jude Law) does. Pitch is the bringer of nightmares. His resurgence after years of being held at bay by the Guardians mobilizes the films heroes who must accept the help of the untested and somewhat irresponsible Jack whose only powers dont seem terribly useful in banishing evil. Jack can induce snow days with a wave of his wooden staff whose touch covers the world with a cascading craquelure of ice. (The animated frost is the most beautiful element of this 3-D movie which otherwise is a little cold emotionally for my taste.) In addition to the showdown between the Guardians and Pitch -- whos startlingly scary especially for younger children -- theres another conflict. Few kids actually believe in Jack Frost other than as a quaint metaphor for cold weather. The drama revolves around this problem. As Pitch becomes more powerful more and more kids start believing in their nightmares and fewer and fewer in the Guardians who at times resemble a junior Justice League doing battle against Doctor Destiny. Except one little boy Jamie (Dakota Goyo) refuses to give up his beliefs. He alone can see Jack probably as a result of a sledding accident that Jack inadvertently caused at the beginning of the film. Its this power of Jamies belief that makes Jack and the other Guardians real again. Thats a sweet thought and the story by Pulitzer-winning playwright and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire (""Rabbit Hole"") spins it out with magic and dark delight. It might sound fluffy but its not. Like fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm parts of ""Rise of the Guardians"" cast strong shadows. But there are laughs too. Baldwin who does a surprisingly credible Russian accent makes an appealing if unusually unjolly Santa with Jackmans Aussie-accented boomerang-wielding Easter Bunny providing much of the comic relief. It might not have been on your Christmas list but with its fresh take on the power of myths ""Rise of the Guardians"" is one present you wont want to return. Contains scary sequences and a frightening character.

Its rotten By Kyle Smith View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) November 21 2012 | 500am Modal Trigger As Guardians they fall Jack Frost (far right) and other childhood mythical beings are enough to give you nightmares. I cant remember ever seeing such a spectacular implosion of a squad of all-stars as ""Rise of the Guardians."" Well not since Yankee Stadium in October. This 3-D cartoon manages to be frantic and bizarre yet boring. Based on William Joyces ""Guardians of Childhood"" series of books and directed by a first-timer named Peter Ramsey it throws together Santa the Easter Bunny Jack Frost the Sandman the Tooth Fairy and the Bogeyman and sets them to racing around trying to convince us they belong in the same movie. They dont. The Bogeyman (Jude Law) angry because the kids dont believe in him is jealous of the other characters so he tries to disrupt childrens dreams steal the teeth under their pillows and make off with all the Easter eggs so youngsters wont believe in any of his rivals. So the Guardians convene at Santas place at the North Pole for an emergency meeting. I grew up on Sid and Marty Krofft (""H.R. Pufnstuf"") so I thought I knew weird but nothing about the psychedelic 70s in childrens entertainment prepared me for this. I spent all of ""Rise of the Guardians"" thinking Why? Why is Santa (Alec Baldwin) Russian and why does he look like a bouncer? Hes got ""naughty"" and ""nice"" tats on his forearms he carries gladiator swords in both hands hes shaped like a refrigerator with feet hes got an army of on-call yetis who paint toys for him. Yetis? Howd the elf union let them take their jobs? Now the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman) Hes a 6-foot Australian who carries a boomerang just as youve always pictured him. The Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) is a creepy green pixie attended by hummingbird minions who fly around picking up kids teeth which are said to be important because they contain childrens ""memories."" No theyre important because theyre exchangeable for cash. Memories hang out in minds remember? Jack Frost (Chris Pine) is a vinyl-faced 300-year-old teenager with a mysterious back story that the film keeps us waiting for not that it changes anything. As for the Sandman well that legendary figure of fancy who has captured so many imaginations for depositing crust in eyes needed the most work. So what did they come up with? Hes a golden garden gnome who doesnt speak (instead he has emoticons float up over his head) and brandishes whips made of sand. Of course. On this team of rivals there is mild joshing. A typically awful line is Jack Frost on the Easter Bunny ""Hes real all right. Real grumpy real annoying and real full of himself"" The movie dives right into establishing how boring these characters are. Jack for instance cant do much except fly and spread the cold in winter. An early scene shows him helping some kids in a snowball fight ""Who needs ammo?"" he exclaims casting his staff to make snow -- when the grounds already covered with the white stuff. The Tooth Fairys gig is equally dull Pitch Black (the Bogeymans formal name) steals the kids teeth but are todays tots really going to get too worked up if they dont get a quarter under their pillow? If you really want to terrify them youd have to come up with a villain who limits their iPhone data plan. As for Pitch he spends a lot of time being sinister and threatening but its not clear that he has the power to do much of anything except give kids nightmares. Mostly he just throws sparkly black sand. At one point he breaks Jack Frosts crook rendering him powerless but then Jack just pieces it back together and its fine. So what was the point? Also Pitch can apparently be made to go away with a mere punch in the nose. ""Rise of the Guardians"" is so odd its like biting into what looks like chocolate ice cream and discovering its peach. No stranger than that liver. Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Who watches the Watchmen DVD?

It has a great voice cast a kinda-sorta interesting premise and the 3-D is effective but somehow it just doesnt add up.The Guardians are a kind of supergroup of childhood characters.

"Movie review Rise of the Guardians gives the storybook an edge - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-GuardiansReview Rise of the Guardians gives the storybook an edgeIts Santa Claus Jack Frost the Easter Bunny and more as never seen before in a tale of childhood figures handpicked by the Man on the Moon to be protectors.November 20 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic In DreamWorks new animation adventure ""Rise of the Guardians"" Santa has tats he goes by the name North and he sounds like Alec Baldwin. Jack Frost is a renegade kid a snowboarding/ice skating ace brought to life by Chris Pine who brings all of his ""Star Trek"" swagger. The movies total nightmare of a boogeyman is Pitch who lurks around in the dark and drips with sinister sarcasm courtesy of Jude Law. Its as if hip-hop has come to Candyland bringing an urban edginess to the traditional storybook rap. But thats only the tip of the 3-D iceberg.Since childhood innocence and belief in all things Hallmark is at risk the film keeps piling on. Bunny is a fist-full-of-dyed-eggs Easter-wood type with Hugh Jackman doing the tough talking. Tooth is a sexy sweetie thanks to Isla Fisher. But her fairy force doesnt stop at doling out quarters they also save the ""teeth"" which seems to make them candidates for a guest turn on ""Dexter."" If youre not careful edgy can send things right over the cliff.There is more than the usual darkness in childrens author William Joyces original imagining of the Guardians as a collective of protectors handpicked by the Man in the Moon (Joyce serves as ""Guardians"" executive producer along with Guillermo del Toro). The films new chapter shaped by playwright and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire with storyboard artist Peter Ramsey making his directing debut unfolds about 300 years into their alliance. North Bunny Tooth and Sandy (the silent and often snoozing Sand Man) are tight. Jack remains a disaffected teen who doesnt understand how he even made Moons list a his special talents involve turning water into ice faster than a Sub-Zero.PHOTOS Rise of the GuardiansBut foreboding forces are gathering because kids are far too happy for party-pooping Pitchs taste. He concocts a plan to wipe out any good vibrations and amasses an army made from the stuff of very bad dreams. For reasons known only to the Man in the Moon the Guardians must enlist Jack in this fight and Frost has no intention of making it easy. Theres some back and forth including a pitch by Pitch that Jack cross over to the dark side. But this is a fairy tale so you know how that ends. As good as Law is as Pitch in stirring up trouble a and he is very good at being bad a the real surprise is Pine. He might have a face and a physique tailor-made for real-life action-hero gigs but hes definitely got a voice for animation. If Frost had been frozen Pitch would not have been the only problem.Making the threat global opens the way for the animators to spice things up with forays into distant lands a a great chase scene across the rooftops of Shanghai is the best. But for the most part the filmmakers keep things grounded; much of the war rages around two kids who live in a small New England town. Jamie (Dakota Goyo) is the boy who wont stop believing. His little sister Sophie (Georgie Grieve) adds charm and comic relief by stumbling into the portal that links the real world to the Guardians. Not surprisingly shes content to run amok while the Guardians struggle to keep up with her a apparently their superpowers are no match for a toddler.There are some pretty scary bits for the munchkin crowd. The fire-breathing horses that Pitch unleashes might be too frightening for some tykes but its the dungeons even without the dragons that are the most unsettling. The mood swings wildly between the emotional ups and downs of childhood a including what Jack remembers of his a and full-on ""Terminator""-style fighting. The two dont always sit well together.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsThe CG animation is painterly and might have been too perfect for the tone if the filmmakers hadnt mussed it up with some street grit and in-your-face attitude thanks primarily to Baldwin and Jackman. When Pitch goes about conjuring up evil a one touch and unicorns go up in black smoke a the animation is crazily good. The action scenes with Jack shredding snowdrifts or riding a blizzards gale-force winds like waves are totally chill too.But Norths workshop is a manic mess of elves and toys and mayhem. He really needs to get his act together and not rely on a sasquatch (big hairy origins unknown) to manage things. Tooths many minions are on the Type-A side like hummingbirds on steroids with all their flitting here and there. Some of the scenes are minimal in detail others are jam-packed and can make for visual overload. There is a lot to savor in ""Rise of the Guardians"" but sometimes too much of a good thing can be exhausting.------------------------------Rise of the GuardiansMPAA rating PG for thematic elements and some mildly scary actionRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesPlaying In general releasebetsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO What to see during Thanksgiving weekend The Envelope Awards Insider PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDirectors discuss the work and play anglesDecember 6 2012For animated film directors is taking creative input a...November 30 2012Spying the seasons offeringsNovember 3 2012Guillermo del Toro stumps for Rise of the GuardiansOctober 31 2012Leading The WayAugust 6 2008MORE STORIES ABOUTGuardiansMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-rise-of-the-guardians-review20121121,0,6077099.story",200,riseoftheguardians22,riseoftheguardians,latimes

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 613 p.m. EST November 20 2012The computer-animated tale is a charming spectacle if a little overloaded.Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourVoices Alec Baldwin Chris Pine Hugh Jackman Isla Fisher Jude LawRated PG; Runtime 1 hour 37 minutes; Opens Wednesday nationwideWhat would happen if Santa Claus the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy joined forces like a storybook troop of Avengers action heroes?According to Rise of the Guardians (  1/2 out of four; rated PG; opening Wednesday nationwide) their coming together would be visually arresting but frenetic. Mashing up all these mythical heroes into one overstuffed tale offers some moments of enchantment. But the overall 3-D computer-animated spectacle with its roller-coaster pace and large cast of characters seems as overloaded as a bulging Christmas stocking.The good vs. evil story is centered on Jack Frost (charmingly voiced by Chris Pine) who feels left out of the pantheon of beloved legendary figures. Even the mutely endearing Sandman is part of the in crowd but silver-haired Jack is inexplicably the odd man out.But when a sinister bogeyman known as Pitch (Jude Law) threatens to turn all dreams into nightmares and obscure the good being done by North (Alec Baldwin) a Santa variant the lanky E. Aster Bunny (Hugh Jackman) and the flitting fairy named Tooth (Isla Fisher) Jack is called in to help fight the good fight. The evil Pitchs goal is to stomp out belief in these storied icons. The happiness of imaginative children is at stake so all must join forces to preserve their illusions.TRUITT Childhood heroes get a back story with GuardiansGUARDIANS CLIP Why Am I Here?VIDEO Chris Pine gets animatedViewers of all ages are encouraged to embrace their inner child and specifically their innocent sense of wonder in this tale based on William Joyces book series The Guardians of Childhood.Some scenes as directed by Peter Ramsey are particularly inventive such as the Easter Bunnys land which artfully incorporates the famous Easter Island statues.The Santa Claus character is humorously voiced by Baldwin but its not entirely clear why he has a thick Russian accent and arms lined with tattoos. (Though having the words ""Naughty"" and ""Nice"" inked among the tats is a cute touch.)Jack Frost whooshes and flies with an appealing abandon. But hes a troubled loner. In a flashback audiences learn the reasons for his icy solitary existence and why he wants so badly to be seen by human kids as they frolic in the snow. His pale boyish character -- vaguely reminiscent of Japanese anime drawings -- is the most intriguing of the heroes particularly as he uncovers his mysterious origins.Though it could have left more magic to the imagination and left out a few treacly cliches the concept is elegantly simple Storybook figures look out for children who for their part keep their holiday-centered legends alive. With its fanciful razzle-dazzle Rise of the Guardians is appealing if slightly hectic family fare.Rise of the Guardians Clip Jack vs BunnySkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Jack (Chris Pine) continues to reject the Guardians offer and gets heated with Bunny (Hugh Jackman) 10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/UG6CgY",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/11/20/rise-of-the-guardians-review/1703037/,200,riseoftheguardians23,riseoftheguardians,usatoday

According to this mostly disposable 3-D animated feature those grand heroes of our childhood dont only deliver toys hide eggs conjure sweet dreams and collect baby teeth. They also wield scimitars throw boomerangs whip granular tendrils and command a miniature fairy army all in defense of innocence worldwide. Like the Owls of GaHoole they are...guardians (These ones are just rising instead of yknow legending.) But when the bogeyman Pitch (Jude Law) threatens the peace North (Alec Baldwin) Bunnymund (Hugh Jackman) mute Sandy and Tooth (Isla Fisher) must train reluctant recruit Jack Frost (Chris Pine) to fight alongside them. The high-concept silliness wears out its welcome fairly quickly; turns out theres only so much elation to be had from an Aussie-accented rabbit striking cottontail kung fu poses. Who knew? Executive producer Guillermo del Toros influence can be felt in a few sequences such as during a chase through Pitchs Escheresque underground lair and in the reveal of amnesiac Jacks selflessly tragic backstory. But the voice work sounds more quick-paycheck than impassioned and the animation rarely rises above video-game cut-scene quality. As revisionist holiday fables go youre better off watching Aardmans delightful Arthur Christmas than this lump of coal.

Photo DreamWorks Animation Associated Press Rise of the Guardians review Better watch out 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Rise of the Guardians Animated adventure. Starring the voices of Chris Pine Alec Baldwin Jude Law and Isla Fisher. Directed by Peter Ramsey. (PG. 97 minutes.) ""Rise of the Guardians"" is both family film and expose pulling back the curtain on our favorite holiday symbols. Most shocking truths Santa Claus looks as if he spends more time at the gym than the toy factory and the tooth fairy has been outsourcing her work. Kids will have to learn the truth sooner or later and the new DreamWorks Animation film has a spunky charm even as the story gets lost in a flurry of action and emotional cues. Children will enjoy the barrage of visual stimulation and adults will appreciate the fact that theres no bathroom humor or back-talking teenagers at the North Pole. It also does nothing to sully what has been a very good year for mainstream animation. From ""The Pirates Band of Misfits"" to ""Brave"" to ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and now ""Guardians"" Hollywood seems to be embracing different styles and new ideas. Even the stop-motion ""Frankenweenie"" - technically a remake - was essentially a new movie. ""Rise of the Guardians"" begins with Jack Frost joining the Guardians a group of super-powered holiday symbols including Santa Easter Bunny Sandman and Tooth Fairy. (Prospect betting odds for the new character in ""Rise of the Guardians 2"" St. Patricks Day Leprechaun 2-1; Mother Nature 6-1; The Great Pumpkin 500-1.) Innocence and joy are threatened by the Boogeyman and from there the plot comes pretty close to mirroring this summers ""The Avengers"" movie. Mostly in a good way. ""Rise of the Guardians"" is at its best when it slows down especially in one of the holiday-theme set pieces. The North Pole is particularly enthralling with its comic-relief elves and furry toy-making monsters that must have been the result of filmmaker demands to ""make them look more like Wilford Brimley"" Alec Baldwin (trying a Russian accent) as Santa and Jude Law as the Boogeyman lead the solid voice cast. The film is based loosely on the William Joyce book ""The Guardians of Childhood"" and it retains much of the storybook charm. Theres a dark edge (thats a warning to parents with very small children) and no shortage of poignant moments - Frosts last-ditch attempt to preserve a childs faith in the Easter Bunny is particularly poetic. The action is less successful with chase scenes and battles that are underwhelming. Fights become repetitive. The Boogeyman summons one too many black clouds that morph into horses. Part of the problem The filmmakers dont always make the rules especially clear. Even at the end of the film Santas powers are a little vague. (He whips out a couple of swords when the bad guy shows up but no ""Silent Night Deadly Night""-style bloodletting occurs.) All thats certain is in a bar fight you want the Easter Bunny getting your back while the Tooth Fairy is close to useless. Speaking of the Tooth Fairy shes pretty cheap in this film. Unless those were silver doubloons her underpaid workforce appears to be handing out quarters. If the Tooth Fairy is giving out dollars to your kids point to this film as bad news that deflation is imminent ... Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Photo Credit DreamWorks Animation advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Jack Frost joins Santa Claus the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy to battle a common foe. BOTTOM LINE Beautiful visuals and rich storytelling elevate this animated movie above the usual kids fare. CAST Chris Pine Alec Baldwin Isla Fisher Hugh Jackman LENGTH 137 Everybody wants to be a superhero these days and that apparently includes Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny who become weapons-wielding warriors in ""Rise of the Guardians."" Their common foe a bogeyman named Pitch who plans to rule the world by crushing the hopes of children. This animated 3-D film is essentially a Marvel-ized version of old fairy tales but ""Rise of the Guardians"" has several things going for it. For one its quite beautiful filled with shimmering light and deep shadows. (Its visual consultant is Roger Deakins the cinematographer known for his Coen brothers films.) It also tells a thematically rich story thanks to screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright who builds nicely upon William Joyces novels. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Our hero is Jack Frost (an appealing Chris Pine) cleverly envisioned as a tousle-haired teen in a hoodie. Hes a B-lister in the mythical pantheon but when Pitch (Jude Law one of the U.K.s great sneerers) launches his campaign of nightmares Jack is drafted into the league of Guardians. He also undergoes a personal journey which means -- you guessed it -- an origin story. Jack feels like a real character but his cohorts feel overly contrived. Santa Claus nicknamed North (Alec Baldwin) is a kind of Russian biker with ""nice"" and ""naughty"" tattoos; the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) is pretty but thats all; Sandy the Sandman goofs around like Harpo Marx (he never speaks). E. Aster Bunnymund a macho rodent with the Aussie yawp of Hugh Jackman leads an army of tiny walking eggs -- not the most rousing image. Jacks back story isnt all sweetness and light (director Peter Ramsey handles the material deftly) but it gives ""Rise of the Guardians"" some welcome heft. Still as with so many superhero movies I fear the sequel. 230 VideoTrailer Rise of the Guardians PLOT Jack Frost joins Santa Claus the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy to battle a common foe. advertisement | advertise on newsday CAST Chris Pine Alec Baldwin Isla Fisher Hugh Jackman LENGTH 137 BOTTOM LINE Beautiful visuals and rich storytelling elevate this animated movie above the usual kids fare.

Its fun to tell lies to tiny people with an instinctive predisposition to believe everything grown-ups say--such as the assertion that windows get frosty and foliage turns colors because of this one particular dude.Jack Frost (Chris Pine) the hoodie-wearing hero of director Peter Ramseys sweet fun Rise of the Guardians has the terrifying ability to accelerate entropy and therefore hasten the heat death of the universe--or in the comforting parlance of childrens stories he nips noses with frosty mischief.Nobody can see or hear him and hes super lonely. He has no memory of the life he had before becoming Jack Frost and the only reason he even knows his name is because the moon told him which no surprises there totally normal thing for the moon to do. Jack coexists in the same world as Santa Claus the Easter bunny the tooth fairy and the old sleepy-time sandman collectively known as the Guardians a coalition of powerful beings kind of like the Avengers or 80s-era supergroup Damn Yankees. In that analogy the Easter Bunny would pretty clearly be Tommy Shaw. Santa Claus the groups Ted Nugent is voiced by Alec Baldwin and reimagined as a jolly Russian alpha male whose forearms are sleeved in tribal tattoos. Happily the film skews away from the established templates for these archetypes in order to present something new. Santa Claus never goes ""ho ho ho"" and hes apparently not in the business of rendering Manichean judgments on the behavior of children.Film Details Rise of the Guardians RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time97 More Info Trailer Not all its new templates are new though. Hugh Jackmans E. Aster Bunnymund the Easter bunny is a boilerplate Australian rogue who despite his fondness for bright pastels and hard-boiled eggs is also deadly with (sigh) his boomerangs. The character leans pretty hard on audience preconceptions of outback bumpkins even delivering what has to be the worlds most flaccid ""thats not a knife"" joke. The bunny walks the exceedingly fine line between crowd-pleasing hero and obnoxious stereotype.By contrast the sandman actually is a crowd-pleasing hero a silent Harpo Marx-ish sprite who communicates via the cute floating sand emojis he telekinetically generates with his pineal gland or something. Hes the films most formidable fighter and the locus of several heroic moments so naturally the bad guy targets him first. And the tooth fairy (Isla Fisher) is a feathered and iridescent pixie with an army of little color-coordinated birds comprising a world-class courier and express-delivery service considering earths vast output of teeth. Here baby teeth contain the earliest memories of the owners of the mouths from which they erupted suggesting that Jacks memories are buried somewhere in an infinitely large pile of pulpy dentin and enamel.Based on illustrator William Joyces book The Guardians of Childhood the film continues the migration of Dreamworks Animation away from the broad staccato jokes and obvious pop-culture references that characterized the studios Shrek period in favor of something more enduring. As a visual artist Joyce favors storybook timelessness nostalgic Americana and the props of childhood all of which inform Ramseys film and is an approach long favored by rival studio Pixar. It might be unfair to compare Rise of the Guardians to that studios two most recent films--narratively distracted efforts that despite appealing characters never quite cohere--but at times it approaches some of Pixars best.If you completely unpack the films plot its a hierarchical set of nested lies A bunch of sprite-like beings whom in real life weve fabricated to trick children are for movie purposes actually real. But they will vanish in puffs of rationality if children stop believing in them. Its worth noting that this is exactly what will happen in real life a milestone on the journey to existential disappointment. So the self-reinforcing work of these mythical beings is to kindle widespread belief in their own existence (i.e. lies). The bogeyman known as Pitch (Jude Law) has an insidious plan to undermine the collective faith of the worlds children by replacing the sandmans dreams with horrible nightmares and by interrupting the annual Easter pilgrimage of anthropomorphic eggs (long story).To combat the bogeyman the moon--apparently a kind of aloof Nick Fury-grade administrative director--compels Jack Frost to join the Guardians in order to save the faith of the worlds children and by extension the lives of the other Guardians. We meet the films variations on these famous archetypes through his perspective entailing confrontations with evil horses aerial chase scenes Luciferian temptations and a standard-issue coming-of-age adventure story in which Jack learns who he once was chooses a destiny visits the Dagobah system says ""One does not simply walk into Mordor"" etc. etc.Thats all good but heres a complaint The fey effete Pitch tears a page from the Disney Style Guide for Closeted Gay Villains in the tradition of Cruella de Ville Ursula the weirdly interchangeable Scar and Jafar and Snow Whites wicked stepmother. (Oh and Skyfall.) Its obvious dog-whistle signaling for reactionary old persons such as Brit Hume and Victoria Jackson to whom gay people are the scariest possible villains. But in an era in which gay marriage has been legalized in nine states and the District of Columbia this is the wrong kind of nostalgia.

"Rise of the Guardians | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rise-of-the-guardians ) Rise of the Guardians (United States 2012) November 19 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The summer of 2012 was dismal for animated fare but with releases like Frankenweenie Wreck-It Ralph and Rise of the Guardians things have taken a turn for the better during the autumn. This movie which is targeted at older children (rather than pre-schoolers) explores the unconventional premise of establishing certain well-known mythical characters as superheroes. So we have a Russian-accented tattooed sword wielding Santa Clause (voice of Alec Baldwin) an Australian boomerang-throwing Easter Bunny (voice of Hugh Jackman) a Tooth Fairy (voice of Isla Fisher) who looks like a cross between a woman and a humming bird and a silent benevolent Sandman. Sort of a League of Extraordinary Legends. From story to execution Rise of the Guardians feels like a hybrid of conventional animation and material like The Avengers. The viewers portal of entry into this world is Jack Frost (voice of Chris Pine) the latest addition to the group. Jack is an unwilling hero - he would prefer to roam the world on his own freezing ponds and causing snow days. The Easter Bunny has a beef with him because of his penchant for wrecking the spring holiday with reminders of winter but Santas okay with his weather-making skills. The Tooth Fairy admires his shiny white teeth. The worlds children are threatened by Pitch (voice of Jude Law) a.k.a. The Boogie Man who wants to turn dreams into nightmares and banish belief in Santa Bunny and Tooth. Jack reluctantly agrees to help and in the process discovers the true hero within. The movie unfolds at a brisk pace with plenty of adventure humor and moments of surprising emotional depth. Pitchs reasons for being bad boast an interesting backstory and although Jacks journey is similar to that of almost every budding superhero there are some intriguing twists. Although Rise of the Guardians isnt a Christmas film (in fact it takes place in the March/April timeframe) the importance of Santa as the leader of the Guardians makes it feel like a seasonal offering. The films visual appeal is strong. The characters are rendered as leaner and meaner than what were used to seeing with Santa being portrayed as a warrior and the Easter Bunny as anything but a cute little rabbit. The ""cuddly"" aspect is reserved for Tooths army of apprentices and Santas clueless elves. The mythical environments we see - the North Pole the Bunnys hole and Pitchs domain - are effectively rendered. Rise of the Guardians makes good use of 3-D not overdoing it with ostentatious flourishes but not being so subtle that the viewer is largely unaware of it. Is 3-D necessary to ones enjoyment of the movie? No but this is one time I can justify recommending payment of the surcharge. The voice actors do what voice actors are expected to do in roles like these preserve their anonymity. Alec Baldwin and Hugh Jackman have recognizable voices but they disguise them effectively. (In fact I didnt know Baldwin was Santa until I saw the end credits.) Chris Pine and Isla Fisher dont do much to hide their voices (although Fisher adopts an American accent) but they dont need to. The only one immediately recognizable is Jude Law but Pitch who bears a striking resemblance to Hades from Disneys Hercules is so deliciously evil that the character quickly shakes off any associations we may have with the actor. Theres less comedy in Rise of the Guardians than in many animated films but thats understandable given the epic scale of the adventure. Thats not to say theres no humor but its kept in the background and often involves Santas elves or the North Pole Yeti. Rise of the Guardians was made with the obvious intention of being the origin story for a new animated superhero franchise and if the film is profitable there will be a sequel in another two or three years. However even if theres never a follow-up chapter Rise of the Guardians is enjoyable as a stand-alone adventure - not groundbreaking animation but a solidly entertaining 90 minutes for older children and adults.

TWITTER The DreamWorks Animation production features the voices of Alec Baldwin Hugh Jackman Isla Fisher and Chris Pine. A very odd assortment of mythical childhood figures some of them afflicted with severe emotional insecurities and inferiority complexes are thrown together as an unlikely set of action heroes in Rise of the Guardians an attractively designed but overly busy and derivative mishmash of kid-friendly elements. PHOTOS Fall Movie Preview 2012 Major New Releases From Spielberg Jackson Tarantino the Wachowskis Burton and More A sort of Justice League or Avengers equivalent made up of the fearsome team of Santa Claus the Easter Bunny the Tooth Fairy the Sandman and Jack Frost this final DreamWorks Animation production set to be distributed by Paramount will play in a predictably agreeable and profitable fashion to small fry but will skew young despite the presence of an excellent voice cast. The world premiere took place Oct. 10 at the Mill Valley Film Festival in advance of the Nov. 21 commercial bow. Based on the book series Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce as well as on the authors short film The Man in the Moon the script by David Lindsay-Abaire (Robots Rabbit Hole) plays fast and loose with these legendary fixtures of childhood attaching to them all sorts of neuroses feelings of inadequacy and the sense or threat of being ignored. Some might find this tack delightfully mischievous but its just as easy to reject as ridiculous the notion that Jack Frost -- a free spirit very much like Peter Pan who can fly around anywhere he wants -- suffers from an emotional trauma he suffered hundreds of years earlier. STORY Rise of the Guardians to Receive New Vanity Fair Honor at Upcoming Rome Fest Perhaps the most readily amusing of the gang is Santa or as he is more geographically named here North. A muscular powerhouse rather than a fatso North has heavily tatted forearms and as wonderfully voiced by Alec Baldwin sports a distinctive Russian accent not inappropriate to the proximity of that country to his palatial mountainside workshop. Also gathering here are the rangy and rascally E. Aster Bunnymund (an excellent Hugh Jackman) the hummingbird-like Tooth (or Tooth Fairy delightfully rendered by Isla Fisher) the mute and tubby spinner of gold Sandman and ultimately Jack (a fine Chris Pine) who has wandered the globe alone for centuries and feels woefully unrecognized compared to the others because he has no special day or occasion to make an imprint on the lives of children. All the same Jack is hard-pressed by North to join in the battle against Pitch (as in pitch black) a diabolical figure (plausibly acted by Jude Law) who after a long absence has returned to throw Earth into darkness and provide much-needed nightmares to kids everywhere. As with Jack Pitchs re-emergence feels arbitrary and generic while the tall sneering and stubby-toothed figure bears far too close a resemblance to Harry Potters Voldemort as do his minions black steeds that disintegrate into fragments and flash through the sky almost identically to Death Eaters. So while Jack tries to sort out his issues of neglect (kids in small-town America dont even notice him) and struggles over whether or not to join the others the battle against the lord of the night commences. Director Peter Ramsey a longtime storyboard artist making his feature directorial debut after beginning with the 2009 telefilm Monsters vs. Aliens Mutant Pumpkins From Outer Space never misses a chance to throw in one more roller-coaster-like visual ride to pump up the 3D experience. But the characters and settings are attractively designed and the vocal performances have real color and a sense of fun that gently undercuts the treacly sincerity of certain obligatory kid-pandering moments. Composer Alexandre Desplat really gets a workout here dextrously blanketing the film with ever-changing tempos and motifs to suit the moment and propel the action.

Toplined by Santa Claus the Easter Bunny and an army of tittering tooth fairies ""Rise of the Guardians"" yearns to be a magical experience the kind that implores audiences of all ages to abandon skepticism and embrace their childlike sense of wonder. Yet even tots may emerge feeling slightly browbeaten by this colorful strenuous and hyperactive fantasy which has moments of charm and beauty but often resembles an exploding toy factory rather than a work of honest enchantment. Accessible storybook elements and 3D thrill-ride aesthetics should yield robust holiday biz though likely not at the level of DreamWorks toon-franchise fare. Loosely adapted by playwright and occasional screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire from William Joyces book series ""The Guardians of Childhood"" (as well as from Joyces short pic ""The Man in the Moon"") the film boasts a wondrous premise centered around a secret circle of supernatural gift-givers tasked with protecting the children of the world from darkness and despair. These iconic Guardians include North (voiced by Alec Baldwin) a well-built Slavic-accented Santa; Bunny (Hugh Jackman) who turns every Easter into a most egg-cellent holiday; Tooth (Isla Fisher) who relies on her pint-sized minions to swap coins for incisors; and the mute but oh-so-eloquent Sandy whose golden pixie dust ensures the sweetest of dreams. But those dreams are threatening to become permanent nightmares due to Pitch Black (Jude Law) an embittered boogeyman (think Voldemort with hair) who schemes to overthrow the Guardians by ensuring that all children cease to believe in them. By way of a strange lunar prophecy it falls to the winter sprite known as Jack Frost (Chris Pine) to join their ranks and save the day to the initial chagrin of the springtime-loving Bunny who sees this icy outsider as a curious candidate for Guardianship. The mystery of Jacks lonely frigid existence is established in a 300-years-earlier prologue gracefully directed by first-time feature helmer Peter Ramsey. Playful and mischievous yet full of existential melancholy Jack yearns for nothing more than to be seen and known by the human children he romps with invisibly in the snow. ""Seeing is believing"" would seem to be the operative theme here and to that end ""Rise of the Guardians"" devotes itself to making sure viewers buy every frame of its noisy elaborate fantasy universe peddling its visual wonders with slick salesman-like aggressiveness. There is to be sure a great deal to ooh and aah over especially in 3D (lenser Roger Deakins served as a visual consultant and the graphic influence of exec producer Guillermo del Toro is keenly felt). The films dynamically shifting angles are forever directing the viewer to look this way and that from a room full of floating baubles at Norths Christmas emporium to the cute sight of hundreds of Easter eggs scuttling on tiny feet through Bunnys underground warren. Scene after scene is liberally coated with Sandys shimmering yellow dust painstakingly animated so as to assume all manner of clever shapes and patterns and continually backed by the twinkling surging accompaniment of Alexandre Desplats orchestral score. Real enchantment shouldnt have to work so hard or insist on its own importance and as dazzling and stuffed with holiday cheer as it is ""Rise of the Guardians"" somehow falls short of sustained magic. Proceeding breathlessly through a series of quest narratives as the Guardians set out to save Tooths fairies and Bunnys Easter festivities from Pitchs malevolent interference the story turns into a showy self-congratulatory fable about the power and necessity of belief even as its ostentatious production design leaves virtually nothing to the imagination. As the prospect that no one might believe in Santa Claus anymore develops into a global calamity the emotional and psychological needs of kids are duly defended with a pushiness that brings child-welfare activists to mind. Yet none of the tots here are developed as characters beyond their capacity for awestruck naivete and that cloying patronizing attitude extends to the picture as a whole which feels beholden to some whiz-bang corporate ideal of what young people presumably want from entertainment. Individual setpieces feel like blueprints for future theme-park attractions strapping viewers on a galumphing sleigh ride one minute sending them whooshing through an interdimensional portal the next. Offering a welcome respite from the busy proceedings are a few gravely poetic scenes devoted to Jack Frost in isolation as he quietly seeks to untangle the secrets of his past and future. With his pale complexion paler hair and soft angular features Jack at times suggests a character out of Japanese anime; as voiced by Pine hes an appealingly human protagonist and a genuinely captivating creation providing a stark refreshing contrast to the broad comic strokes and funny accents sported by his fellow Guardians. Among the generally strong vocal turns the standout performance is delivered by Law whose silky-sinister British line readings could be mistaken for no other actors. Thesp makes Pitch a fairly memorable baddie as well as a sympathetic embodiment of the ""Bah humbug"" sentiments this lavishly overstuffed picture may unwittingly engender.
