By Peter Rainer Film critic August 6 2010 Save for later Saved Luke Wilson is shown in a scene from Middle Men. Rico Torres/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Luke Wilson often plays characters who seem zoned-out from Day 1. In coscreenwriter and director George Gallos so-so ""Middle Men"" hes playing Jack Harris a straight-laced Texas businessman who in the late 1990s becomes involved with porn stars Internet hucksters Russian gangsters and Vegas con men. Since his involvements are legally semilegitimate he thinks hes clean. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? All the while he remains eerily aloof from the proceedings and increasingly from his wholesome wife and young son. Is Jack who is patterned on a real-life character sociopathic or just plain clueless? Gallo doesnt seem to care. He cares about parading before us lowlifes living the high life.

"Middle Man movie review Tale of porn purveyors cant find its focus |       NJ.com comments Middle Man movie review Tale of porn purveyors cant find its focus Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 06 2010 at 811 AM View/Post Comments Rico TorresLuke Wilson plays Jack Harris in ""Middle Men."" Middle Men"" is what youd get if you took the script from ""Boogie Nights"" cut-and-pasted in some old articles from ""Wired"" and then filmed it like the last half-hour of ""Goodfellas."" In other words kind of a mess. The film which seems both sped up and oddly disconnected (it began its life as a pitch for an HBO series) starts in the mid-90s as a pair of idiots combine their twin loves of smut and computers to ""invent"" internet porn or at least a way to pay for it. And pay for it they will as their brainstorm leads them to Russian mobsters tenacious FBI agents and dead bodies. Their only hope in turns out is the squarest of the square -- an honest-to-Norman-Rockwell happily married who sees a way to turn the billing part of the business into hundreds of legal millions. At least he thinks he sees a way to do that. Director George Gallo probably thought he saw a movie in all of this too. His producers should have been a little suspicious. As a guy with a computer Gallo has written a couple of hits -- ""Midnight Run"" ""Bad Boys."" As far as directing goes though -- well hes really a guy who should stay behind his computer. Movie Review Middle Men (R) Paramount Vantage (105 min.) Directed by George Gallo. With Luke Wilson. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains graphic nudity violence strong language and substance abuse. TWO STARS Of course ""Middle Men"" is about millions of men who stay behind their own computers drooling over artificially inflated females. The challenge here is to not only make that interesting but something short of wall-to-wall offensive. Its not a challenge the film meets. Gallos two initial internerds are played by Giovanni Ribisi and Gabriel Macht and they spend the entire film cursing chain-smoking and slapping each other around. After the first few minutes youll want to slap them around too. The milieu they move through meanwhile is simply well boring. ""Boogie Nights"" found a weird camaraderie in the porn industry; movies like ""Body Double"" reveled in its crass honesty. ""Middle Man"" just makes it shiny and dull -- yards of plastic flesh plastic smiles plastic money. The bright spot comes from Luke Wilson a modest rangy actor who often has been overshadowed by his brother Owen. Luke would have made a good TV cowboy once and his inherent decency here as Jack the unhip business adviser offers up a nice contrast with the setting. But the script never dramatizes the pull on Jack of either this sexy new world (which never seems particularly erotic) or his old life (which never seems particularly loving). It signals his decadence by suddenly having him wear sunglasses a lot -- just as it trumpets ""ironic resolution"" by cueing up ""You Cant Always Get What You Want."" The film by the way ends with title cards explaining what happened to the characters in real life. Except there is no real life -- the film the producer has admitted is a ""highly fictionalized"" work full of ""composites of various people"" and ""some wholly created characters."" In other words as absolutely fake as that woman up there at screen left by the brass pole. And about as fascinating to listen to. -- Stephen Whitty View/Post Comments Related Stories Listen to the latest episode of our TV podcast Subscribe on iTunes Subscribe on Stitcher Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See whats for sale Find a business View obituaries Get Your Weekly Entertainment Guide TV recaps movie and music reviews local dining guides and the latest in Atlantic City entertainment news delivered to your inbox Leave this field blank optional Check here if you do not want to receive additional email offers and information.

Just because George Gallos ""Middle Men"" falls short of its appar ent goal to be the ""Boogie Nights"" of In ternet porn doesnt mean this loosely fact-inspired serio-comedy isnt far more entertaining than youd expect from a film that was dumped into theaters with minimal promotion by Paramount. Luke Wilson who has appeared in a long run of bad movies seizes on his juiciest role since ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" here. He plays Jack Harris a Houston businessman who in 1995 envisions enormous profit potential when he meets a pair of stoners who have invented software that allows anyone in the world to discreetly download porn using a computer and credit card. Harris a fictionalized version of producer Christopher Mallick is introduced to Wayne Beering (Giovanni Ribisi) and Buck Dolby (Gabriel Macht) because theyre already having issues with a Russian mob boss. But Jack deludes himself into believing he can solve his familys financial problems without getting involved in porns seamy side by acting strictly as a middleman. Its a naive rationalization that Jack shares with the whistle-blowing hero of Steven Soderberghs ""The Informant"" Eventually hes spending less time with his wife (Jacinda Barrett) and kids back in Texas than with one of his clients a 22-year-old Internet porn star (Laura Ramsey) in Los Angeles. By this point Jack is in deep thanks to the accidental killing of a bag man sent by the Russian mobster (Rade Serbedzija) a secret side deal by his loose-cannon partners involving child pornography and an unlikely alliance with an FBI agent (Kevin Pollak) tracking post-9/11 terrorists. Jack who places entirely too much faith in his skills as a calm smooth-talking negotiator -- at one point he tries to blackmail a district attorney (a hilarious cameo by Kelsey Grammer) -- also has to reckon with a sleazy but well-connected lawyer hes unwisely cut out of a deal with his partners. The lawyer is wonderfully played by a foulmouthed James Caan a hoot whos working with Wilson for the first time since the latters acting debut ""Bottle Rocket."" ""Middle Men"" shows evidence of post-production tampering possibly at the behest of a studio unnerved by the movies seamier aspects. The complex flashbacks are sometimes confusingly edited a problem only partly fixed by wall-to-wall narration. However uneven this very well-acted often amusing and dirty-minded hard-R film still stands out in a sea of market-driven blandness. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Rosie ODonnell to host talk show on Oprahs new TV networ...

In this film publicity image released by Paramount Pictures Luke Wilson is shown in a scene from ""Middle Men."" Photo Rico Torres AP Movie review Middle Men surprisingly tense 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Middle Men Drama. Starring Luke Wilson Giovanni Ribisi Gabriel Macht and James Caan. Directed by George Gallo. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The birth of the Internet porn industry is the subject of ""Middle Men"" which might lead one to expect a jolly sex-filled romp perhaps a little tasteless and sophomoric almost certainly oblivious in terms of morals. Such a movie is in fact what the coming attractions trailers have been promising for ""Middle Men"" but the actual experience is something entirely different - sober and dispiriting tense and morose. Apparently its based on a true story but because all the names have been changed its impossible to know what details are Hollywood and whats real life. Still the movies world is consistent throughout and thats probably where a lot of its truth resides. Its an ugly world of drugs and exploitation with a criminal element always threatening from the sidelines. According to ""Middle Men"" the Internet porn industry was born when two drug-taking slobs (Giovanni Ribisi and Gabriel Macht) in the mid-1990s came up with a program by which credit cards could be used for Internet transactions. This brought in the first wave of money. The second bigger wave came when they partnered with an honest Texas businessman named Jack Harris (Luke Wilson) who had an even better idea. Instead of generating porn they could make money by establishing an Internet billing service that porn entrepreneurs (and others) could subscribe to - at a fee of 10 percent for every transaction. ""Middle Men"" is an anxious film but not in a good way in that it doesnt generate suspense so much as dread. From almost the first day that Jack gets himself involved in the business he cant get out. To leave would mean risking his life but staying affords no safety either. The movie establishes Jack as its sole person of integrity and as the locus of all our interest and then dangles a big fat sword over his head for about 70 minutes of screen time. In good and bad ways ""Middle Men"" feels true. In voiceover Jack (Wilson) describes what its like to work inside the porn industry and his insights are unexpected and psychologically interesting. At the same time the story is ungainly motivations are muddled and key events that should have been depicted take place off screen. More seriously the movie plays like such a whitewash and validation of the ""Jack Harris"" character that one cant help but get suspicious. It may be true for example that the real Jack Harris was always scrupulously honest and that he cheated on his wife with only one woman and afterward felt really really guilty about it. Its also possible that thats just his story and hes sticking to it. Wilson is as always believable and engaging. James Caan shows up as a sleazy lawyer and though Caan often plays underworld types this one is a departure for him - a liar and a bottom feeder. He creates a complete detailed character and does it well. As the originators of Internet porn Ribisi and Macht are revolting and pathetic but thats what theyre supposed to be. They do it without compromise. -- Advisory Drug use nudity sexual situations simulated sex violence and strong language.

(Paramount) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday August 6 2010 400 AM Title Middle Men If Henry Hill of ""Goodfellas"" had left witness protection and gone straight into the Internet porn racket ""Middle Men"" could have been the next movie made about him. In fact director George Gallo seems so enamored of Martin Scorseses Mafia classic hes borrowed everything from the use of voiceover to the Stones-centric soundtrack to the insistent editing style. Whats missing alas is the artistry.The actual antihero of this seedy tale which was loosely inspired by true events is a straight-arrow Southerner named Jack Harris (Luke Wilson).In 1995 Jack is living a quiet life with his wife (Jacinda Barrett) and kids when he gets a job offer on the West Coast. Hes put out when he meets his new business partners Wayne (Giovanni Ribisi) and Buck (Gabriel Macht) who are obvious drug addicts. And hes not thrilled to hear that hes expected to organize the Internets first viable adult entertainment websites which will allow consumers to download pornography directly into their homes.But theres so much money involved that Jack puts aside his hesitations convinced he alone can rise above the corruption of his chosen profession. (Apparently hes never seen ""Goodfellas"" himself.)Gallo has the start of a good story here but he cant find an original way to explore it. So Wilson narrates incessantly telling us about crucial events and details that we should see for ourselves.We hear about the seductive decadence but Gallo never figures out how to capture it. It doesnt help that none of the leads finds a comfortable equilibrium. Wilson for example is always too calm and remote Ribisi always too volatile and irritating.The supporting cast including James Caan as a sleazy lawyer and Kevin Pollak as an FBI agent fare better. But Gallo wont slow down for a minute to allow the plot to simply unfold. Hes constantly flashing back or forward distracting us or trying to grab our attention. Its a strategy that seems oddly misjudged. Even his characters understand that porn is perfectly capable of selling itself.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet At least give Middle Men credit for being mildly original in its derivativeness. Most films that rip off Goodfellas third act begin conventionally then resort to jittery camerawork frenetic editing and stylistic overload to convey the mounting psychological deterioration and paranoia of coke-addled characters. Middle Men reverses that dynamic by beginning with jittery camerawork frenetic editing and stylistic overload meant to convey the mounting insanity of accidental web pioneers Giovanni Ribisi and Gabriel Macht then grows more conventional as the focus shifts away from two insane jabbering cokeheads stumbling into riches and toward a cool-headed adroit operator played by a miscast Luke Wilson. Based on the true story of Jack Harris a happily married family man turned reluctant porn mogul Middle Men casts Ribisi and Macht as a veterinarian and rocket scientist respectively who squander their intellects getting high and searching for porn in the early days of the dot-com boom. Fortune smiles on the misguided pair when they discover a way to take the shame out of purchasing porn online by billing customers anonymously for their cyber-decadence. Ribisi and Macht quickly get in over their heads and unwisely partner with the Russian mob leaving Wilson to take over and restore some fiscal sanity to a business spinning out of control. Middle Men squanders the relative novelty of its dot-com subject matter by making the 90s online high life look more or less identical to the 70s porn wonderland of Boogie Nights and the glitzy mob world of Goodfellas; mindless decadence is mindless decadence no matter the era or subculture. Director George Gallo quickly loses interest in Ribisi and Machts characters and trades in the obnoxiousness of two assholes living out their Playboy fantasies for the much blander story of a good man corrupted by this dirty dirty business. As the film races into its final act it piles on farfetched subplots involving everything from child pornography to a predatory lawyer (James Caan) to a porn star recruited by the FBI to fight terrorism. Like Ribisi and Machts miniature porn empire Gallos mildly diverting but overstuffed underdeveloped opus could use the cinematic equivalent of a fix-it man like Wilsons character to transform its frenetic jumble of subplots and sleazy characters into a cohesive satisfying whole.

On the one hand the movie revels in the world of skeevy Web entrepreneurs and the mobsters who demand a cut of the action.

Middle Men is that tale told without the hard-boiled whimsy though the classic-rock score remains Wilson plays a relatively decent guy embraced by Caans sleazebag operator who then introduces him to the idiots who will bring about his ultimate undoing.Wilson plays Jack Harris a wholly fictionalized character--""based on a true story"" not so much--who according to George Gallo and Andy Weisss screenplay helps introduce pornography to the World Wide Web and the World Wide Web to your credit card. But Jacks just the middleman He clears the path for the inventors of online porn (Giovanni Ribisi as Wayne Gabriel Macht as Buck) paying off all gangsters attorneys and other crooks and cronies who come at him.Told in flashback its first a stormy night in Houston 2004. Jacks peeling out of the driveway beneath an apocalyptic storm with 4 mil in a zipped-up bag. Bad things are happening he tells the audience and all because ""I figured out a better way for guys to jack off."" Cut to Houston 1998 a church social with fried chicken balloons and the Girl of Jacks Dreams (Diana played by Jacinda Barrett). Cut to Los Angeles 1997 and Wayne and Buck snorting coke in a smoky cramped apartment short on jerk-off options.Called west by a wifes friend to rescue a nightclub Jack lands in Los Angeles like all starry-eyed comers from the flyover who seek reinvention. Before long hes a modest success as a self-proclaimed No. 1 Problem Solver at which point Caan as Vegas shyster Jerry Haggerty rings up Jack and asks him to help Wayne and Buck square their debt to the Russian mob fronted by Rade Serbedzija as Nikita Sokoloff (because Boris Badenov was already spoken for da?). And next thing ya know ol Jacks a millionaire; come 03 hes living large in hardcore (""a world without filters"" he justifies) and leaving behind the mundane humdrum of Houston where hes stashed away Diana and kids in an enormous house hes stopped visiting. Jacks new perks include private jets and porn-star privates (Jack shacks up with Laura Ramseys starlet who brags of her ""tighter pussy""). But the downsides always around the corner in a movie like this; one minute youre knee-deep in dough and strange the next youre being visited by an FBI agent played by Kevin Pollak who likes you enough to give you this one warning see?But for all that predictability Middle Men is smart and tense with each scene drenched in dread Something bads coming but when? Still as a soap it could use more opera. Directed and co-written by Gallo still best known for having done Midnight Run back when Charles Grodin was famous Middle Men is ultimately Scorsese-lite--Goodfellas set in naked lady-filled San Fernando Valley office complexes with Wilson narrating his rise and fall and he hopes redemption. The Stones on the soundtrack are too dead-on; the homage is obvious. And the movies a bit undone amazingly enough by its brevity a running time of not much more than 100 minutes--surprising given the indulgence of most tepid feature films these days.Middle Mens characters are intriguing enough that its a shame when just as we want to know more its off to another place with another thing with another guy who either wants to kill Luke Wilson or get money from Luke Wilson or kill Luke Wilson and then take his money. Theres little time to luxuriate in the opulence of porns profits and little time to suffocate in the feeling of walls closing in on and crushing the poor bastard who thought hed gotten the Good Life.Thankfully then even without much character development the compelling story holds mostly due to Wilson. Jacks a solid center--the guy treats every encounter no matter how intimate or dangerous like a business transaction. He gets stuff done even if it involves blackmailing the Harris County district attorney who insists on prosecuting Jacks son for high school grade tampering. Easily Wilsons best performance since Bottle Rocket (and dont say The Royal Tenenbaums because Gene Hackman swallowed the cast whole which was the point). Definitely better than those ATamp;T ads.

""Boogie Nights"" meets ""Goodfellas"" in ""Middle Men"" a relentlessly sleazy but undeniably intriguing tour of the bottom-feeding netherworld where porn and organized crime do their mutual bump-and-grind. Unabashedly genuflecting to Martin Scorsese as he pushes a whole lot of stuff in your face youd perhaps rather not have within inhaling distance ""Midnight Run"" writer George Gallo applies considerable narrative skill and reasonable cinematic flair to an insanely intricate tale of men who cant resist giving in to their basest instincts. A more heavyweight cast would have helped Paramount push over this immorality tale with audiences not necessarily disposed toward fare that will make them want to take a shower immediately after seeing it. Distrib will release the film this year but a date has not yet been determined. Worthy of being double billed one day with ""The Informant"" due to the remarkable extent of the protags self-denial about what hes really up to ""Middle Men"" is a whopper of an ""inspired by true events"" story about a legit Texas businessman who somehow imagines he remains morally uncontaminated by his surroundings while mixing it up with porn stars Internet scam artists Russian mobsters Vegas wheeler-dealers FBI agents corrupt politicians and assorted scumbags -- all while pretending to maintain a proper if distant family life back home. And hes the so-called good guy with whom youre supposed to identify. At the very least Jack Harris (Luke Wilson) is the guide who via reams of voiceover narration that give Ray Liottas running commentary in ""Goodfellas"" a run for its money provides an ongoing road map through the dizzying maze of sordid events and personalities that populate this lower-middle range of earthly hell. Pic defines its area of interest early on with a sequence the likes of which has assuredly never been seen before in a Hollywood studio feature -- a masturbation montage. The point of this unique interlude is to illustrate a commercial niche unfilled as of 1997 ""something to jerk off to over the Internet."" That need is willingly met by two slime-buckets entirely lacking in principles Wayne Beering (Giovanni Ribisi) and Buck Dolby (Gabriel Macht). Initially grabbing porn straight from magazines and posting it on their site the grubby former veterinarian and NASA technician respectively see the subscriptions start rolling in which means they can now afford more and better drugs. Jack provides the boys with guidance as to how they can much more dramatically increase their income but with millions come associations with people ready to rip you off at best and do you bodily harm at worst. Old-school Vegas lawyer and dealmaker Jerry Haggerty (James Caan) is always happy to help but then never lets you forget your debt to him while much more direct is Russian crime boss Nikita Sokoloff (Rade Serbedzija) whos got a threat for every occasion. The cast is rich with colorful lowlifes and no-goods and Wayne and Bucks complete whacked-outness and acts of utter stupidity become increasingly mind-blowing the more successful they become. They need Jacks help to get them out of their frequent scrapes and thats where Jacks genius shows itself; the man is a master diplomat and calculator who can negotiate a deal from which everyone goes home happy even in the most extreme circumstances. Jack keeps a legal distance from his partners porn activities by officially running only their billing operations and rationalizes it professionally by insisting hes no more involved in the sex business than are respectable hotels that offer it to guests on in-room TV. Still he scarcely sees his wife (Jacinda Barrett) and growing son because hes running a glitzy nightclub becoming far too involved with porn star Audrey Dawns (Laura Ramsey) and ultimately getting into hot water with Nikita. Gallo shows again that he can write funny vulgar dialogue and he moves the action along with reasonable verve and given the complicated story admirable coherence. Where the film doesnt connect as it needs to is with Jacks character. In a tale full of operators Jack is the king but as written and in Wilsons performance one doesnt really see him operating; theres nothing going on in the actors eyes. As a result Jack is pretty bland a seemingly ordinary guy with an expertise that seems to come out of nowhere. It would have been much more interesting to see him as a confident high-stakes gambler who always believes he can out-finesse the other guy. Macht similarly declines to take his character a formerly straight-arrow aspiring-astronaut type to the limit leaving it to Ribisi to steal the show as a certifiable maniac and confrontationalist who really doesnt know what hes saying most of the time. Serbedzija gives his Godfather-like figure some human traits but is downright scary when he wants to be which is much of the time. Sharp around the edges but rather soft at its core ""Middle Men"" sports snazzy production values and an expensive soundtrack of again a la Scorsese a wide assortment of popular tunes.
