By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 715am on Friday Nov. 30 2012 Friday Nov. 30 2012 Friday Nov. 30 2012 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The anvils of obviousness rain down so hard and fast in Killing Them Softly New Zealand-born/Australian-based director Andrew Dominiks meditation on low-rent crime and American decline that it might as well be a Coyote-Road Runner cartoon -- a very bloody self-serious Coyote-Road Runner cartoon with strong performances trapped in a movie that thinks way too highly of itself.The heavy-handedness is evident from the first frame when audio from an Obama hope-and-change campaign speech is juxtaposed with the crumbling landscape of a no-name town in some quadrant of the American Rust Belt. Its the autumn of 2008 the economy is in free fall and two shambling figures -- Frankie (Scoot McNairy Argo) and Russell (the always excellent Ben Mendelsohn from Animal Kingdom) -- meet to talk about what their next scam is going to be.Russell knows a basement-level hood who has the bright idea to hold up an underground gambling operation run by Markie (Ray Liotta). They think they can get away with it because the other gangsters dont trust Markie and will think he staged the robbery himself for some easy cash.Of course no one needs a weatherman to see which way this ill wind is blowing. An enforcer Jackie (Brad Pitt who also co-produced) is brought in to get to the bottom of what happened and dish out the appropriate bullet-backed punishment.Written by Dominik from a novel by George V. Higgins Killing Them Softly is best when portraying criminal camaraderie. Mendelsohn and the empathetic McNairy show off an edgy nervous chemistry and sense of humor while James Gandolfini as a down-on-his-luck hit man whom Jackie hires digs into a deep well of sadness beneath his characters boozy bluster. They overshadow Pitt who doesnt have much to do but look alternately bored and angry and then kill people.For whatever reason no one here has bought a new car since the heyday of land yachts and muscle cars so the streets are boulevards of beat-up but still magnificent American steel.Its all set against a backdrop of dire economic headlines with speeches from then-president Bush Obama and commentators talking about the financial crisis. Its as if everyone in this gray dying city only watches C-SPAN and listens to news radio.Yes we get it The world of street-level thuggery were immersed in is meant to parallel presumed crimes in bank boardrooms and government chambers. And we all reside in a perpetual cultural twilight where nothing -- from the crime to the cars -- is as glamorous and wonderful as it used to be.When combined with Dominik taking a page from Quentin Tarantinos playbook by scoring his scenes of brutal violence with innocuous American pop -- Its Only a Paper Moon or Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries -- Killing Them Softly becomes a piping-hot cup of cliche.Thats too bad because Dominik made the riveting Australian crime film Chopper in 2000 the movie that launched the career of Eric Bana as well as the well-received The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford which also starred Pitt.But in his attempt to make some broad grand statement about contemporary America Dominik may have brought the heaviest anvil down upon himself.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Nov 30 2012 Culture Andrew Dominiks new film starring Brad Pitt is most notable for reminding us of the crime-genre contributions of George V. Higgins. The Weinstein CompanyA mobbed-up card game. Three would-be thieves with more appetite than intelligence. A shotgun. These ingredients formed a recipe for tragedy in the classic third-season Sopranos episode ""Amour Fou."" Twenty-eight years earlier theyd combined to similar effect in the 1974 George V. Higgins crime novel Cogans Trade. I cant say whether the TV episode was directly inspired by the book. But its hard to imagine the existence of The Sopranos itself--or for that matter much of contemporary crime fiction on page or screen--were it not for the profound if largely forgotten genre contributions of Higgins.Like its source material the movie is stylish profane intelligent and diverting. But its disappointing that the result is not more substantial. An heir to Hammett and Hemingway and Chandler and Cain Higgins who died in 1999 has somehow fallen out of the hard-boiled firmament. Yet the tough literate dialogue-driven idiom he helped invent is everywhere in ascendance David Mamet and Elmore Leonard have cited him as major influences (the latter calls his first book The Friends of Eddie Coyle ""the best crime novel ever written""). Groundbreaking entertainments such as The Sopranos The Wire and the collected oeuvre of Quentin Tarantino have all followed closely in the vernacular path beaten by Higgins. Remarkably until now just one of Higginss two-dozen-plus novels had made it to the big screen a 1973 adaptation of Eddie Coyle directed by Peter Yates. But with his new film Killing Them Softly Australian director Andrew Dominik has rediscovered Cogans Trade--with its card heist and doomed losers--and updated it for the economic apprehensions of the Obama era. Like its source material the movie is stylish profane intelligent and eminently diverting. But as much as it is a delight that Dominik has disinterred Higginss work it is a mild disappointment that the result is not more substantial. The directors previous film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was among the most underrated of the last decade as rich and evocative an elegy of Americas outlaw era--and the movies it inspired--as any since Sergio Leones Once Upon a Time in the West. (And no I dont imagine it is a coincidence that one was directed by an Australian and the other by an Italian.) Killing Them Softly by contrast is sly and sharp yet somehow slender--more cinematic short story than novel. An aging bottom-feeder (Vincent Curatola) hires two younger ones (Scoot McNairy Ben Mendelsohn) to hit a card game with the expectation that the games proprietor (Ray Liotta) will be the one to take the fall. But this expectation is not met and violent chastisements inevitably ensue. These are administered at the behest of a mild-mannered mob cutout (Richard Jenkins) by an enigmatic gun for hire (Brad Pitt) and his supplementary muscle (James Gandolfini). Related Story Catching the References in Hitchcock From The Birds to the Blondes And thats pretty much all there is to it. Raymond Chandler once wrote that in the hardboiled genre ""the scene outranked the plot in the sense that a good plot was one that made good scenes."" Dominik seems to have taken this lesson to heart Killing Them Softly unfolds primarily as a series of conversational exchanges (many lifted directly from the Higgins novel) punctuated by spasms of graphic violence. Quite a few of the exchanges--in particular those between Pitt and Jenkins--are extremely good. Pitt glides through his role like a vengeful abstraction as remote and untouchable as Eastwood in the Dollars trilogy or Alain Delon in Le Samourai. At the other end of the evolutionary spectrum Gandofini submits a portrait in self-pitying decadence his mouth a sour purse of chipped teeth and venereal tongue. Its hard to shake the sense that this might be the endpoint of the assassin he played so long ago in True Romance after a couple more decades of drinking and whoring and death. (Full circle ""Amour Fou"" also referenced that role when Gandolfinis Tony was attacked with a corkscrew.) Elsewhere Jenkins exhibits his customary harried vulnerable wit; Liotta his amphibian stare rictus cackle and aura of impending catastrophe. Sam Shepard has an all-too-brief cameo and relative newcomer Scoot McNairy demonstrates promising range on the heels of his impeccable performance in Argo.Dominik directs with panache relocating the story from Boston to a nameless post-industrial Anytown (the film was shot in New Orleans though youd hardly know it) and setting the action in 2008 on the cusp of the financial collapse. But while this permits him some fun with the soundtrack (the varied tunes on offer include ""Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries"" ""Money (Thats What I Want)"" and ""I Think This Town Is Nervous"") Dominik overreaches somewhat in his bid for topicality. Smatterings of political speech--Barack Obama George W. Bush Hank Paulson--are overheard frequently throughout the movie. And though they set up a worthy punch line (one that self-consciously echoes the opening of Blood Simple) their deployment could have been pared down considerably. Indeed despite its hospitably succinct 97-minute running time Killing Them Softly still feels a bit lax and overlong. (An earlier cut reportedly ran to two and a half hours; one has to wonder what was left on the cutting-room floor.) With this film Dominik has done us a commendable service in recalling the crime genres outstanding debt to George V. Higgins. Now it falls to another filmmaker to do a more memorable job of paying it back.

Twitter previousChinas Surprising Assault on HIV/AIDS--and a Cultural TaboonextSenate Democrats Prove to Be More Unified Than GOP Peers Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

A routine even mundane crime story relayed in tones of world-weary fatigue ""Killing Them Softly"" deglams the mob movie to coolly distinctive if rarely pulse-quickening effect. Trading in pleasures of a deliberately rarefied sort writer-director Andrew Dominiks talky character-rich genre piece largely short-circuits thrills to sketch a grimly funny portrait of thugs taking care of business in every rotten sense of the word. Results are at once a bit pretentious and worth savoring by those who dont mind a low-octane approach spelling moderate B.O. for the fall Weinstein Co. release though a well-cast Brad Pitt could enhance its prospects. Though it runs a fleet 97 minutes and finds Dominik in a relatively light mood after the brooding dramatics of 2007s ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" ""Killing Them Softly"" is similarly a film about the complications and hesitations that precede the decision to murder a man. Like its predecessor this confidently made picture is minutely attentive to process marked by occasional arty flourishes and in no hurry to get to the payoffs. No one really wants to hurt anyone in this battered beleaguered world of disorganized crime but its got to be done and with as little expense as possible in these cash-strapped times. Indeed the picture cynically and over-insistently foregrounds the economic crisis throughout updating the setting of George V. Higgins 1974 Boston-set novel ""Cogans Trade"" to Louisiana in the weeks preceding the 2008 presidential election. Lest one miss the tales topical import TV screens and radios are continuously blaring speeches by President George W. Bush and then-candidate Barack Obama full of false hope and lofty talk of choices and consequences repeatedly suggesting that the eras financial gloom and air of general malaise have trickled down even to Americas scuzziest back alleys. It begins with the setup for a particularly pathetic crime as pudgy midlevel crook Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) taps ratty up-and-comer Frankie (Scoot McNairy) to rob a card game run by mob hustler Markie (Ray Liotta). To Johnnys chagrin Frankie foolishly chooses perpetually strung-out loser Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) as his partner. These two dumb kids proceed to hold up the game and make off with the mobs stash in one of the few sequences that delivers a jolt of tightly coiled suspense albeit stemming more from the culprits bumbling incompetence than from anything else. ""You know theyre gonna kill ya?"" Markie murmurs to Russell mid-heist a look of genuine sympathy on his face. The movie goes on to glumly prove his point as his higher-ups bring in their smooth reliable and unfailingly pragmatic enforcer Jackie Cogan (Pitt) to wipe out those responsible. When suspicion falls on Markie Pitt becomes the very picture of a reluctant assassin one who kills strictly out of professional obligation and often hires others to do the dirty work. ""I like to kill em softly -- from a distance"" he says summing up the joyless efficiency with which he goes about his job. Retaining the pungent Elmore Leonard-esque tang of Higgins dialogue yet rendering it tighter and more comprehensible for the screen Dominiks loquacious screenplay employs a stop-and-go rhythm dominated by lengthy two-character exchanges punctuated by potent spasms of violence. Not even a routine beating can be dished out without copious amounts of planning hedging negotiating arguing and cussing beforehand the goombah equivalent of bureaucratic red tape. When the attacks do arrive theyre amply foreshadowed alternately sped up or slowed down for heightened dramatic impact yet drained of anything that might be mistaken for a rush of pleasure. Certainly not for all tastes especially those of straight-up action fans the pictures restraint places a considerable burden on the actors to maintain interest which they shoulder impressively. A couple of them get great tongue-in-cheek entrances; Pitts Jackie sporting shades and slicked-back hair packs just a hint of a strut as he strides into the frame backed by Johnny Cashs ""The Man Comes Around."" James Gandolfini amusingly disagreeable as a hitman whos let his taste for booze and prostitutes ruin his killer instincts is introduced getting off a plane like a shlub attending a sales convention. Appearing exclusively opposite Pitt Richard Jenkins socks over his turn as a bespectacled tight-laced mob liaison with a particular aversion to cigarette smoke. Sam Shepard has a too-brief turn as a local rough but Liotta in only a few minutes of screen time makes poor Markie a figure of real pathos and enormous likability; casting of Liotta and fellow screen-gangster icon Gandolfini slyly underlines the pics notion of the cruel-to-indifferent fates that await everyone in this bloody biz. Skillful technical package is distinguished by Greig Frasers color-muted widescreen lensing Brian A. Kates deft editing and Leslie Shatzs subtle sound design employing occasional drones and dissonances in lieu of a score. In keeping with the economic realities impinging on the story the film was shot in Louisiana for tax-incentive purposes; while the rundown locations are well suited to the storys gone-to-seed atmosphere the absence of New Orleans color and the indiscriminate mix of tough-guy accents suggest these sorry-ass proceedings could be taking place anywhere.

It will help to have a high tolerance for scum and their sordid chatter to enjoy (as opposed to appreciate) ""Killing Them Softly."" Director Andrew Dominiks terrifically crafted film about the amorality of business dressed in the black leather of a gangster movie stars Brad Pitt as a hit man called by the mob to handle a business nuisance. Forget honor among thieves. In the world killer Jackie Cogan (Pitt) travels there is very little honor period. Not only are wannabes breaking mob codes but its obvious from broadcasts emanating from TVs hanging in bars and back rooms Americas been led to the precipice by its unethical financial institutions. Although based on the 1 974 novel ""Cogans Trade"" by the late crime novelist George V. Higgins the action is willfully set in 2008 in New Orleans. Dry cleaner Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) has the clever idea to hire a couple of neer-do-wells to rob a mob-protected card game run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). Seems like a sure way to the grave but since the games been hit before Johnnys got misdirection on his side. After all Markie pulled the same trick before. This time reasons Johnny Markie will be the obvious suspect. Johnny hires badly naturally. Scoot McNairy plays the wiry recently paroled Frankie. Ben Mendelsohn is Russell a heroin addict and dog snatcher. You can nearly smell Russell from the screen hes that rank. The Aussie actor was amazing in David Michods impressive gangster drama ""Animal Kingdom."" Unlike that grim piece of work this movie has no one to root for except perhaps game runner Markie. Liotta brings a kind of curdled charm to the role. Director Dominik adapted Higgins writing known for its vivid dialogue. And Jackie Cogan is without a doubt a craftsman. (Sam Shepard makes a brief bruising appearance as the enforcer he subs for.) In fact Jackies the most professional guy onscreen. Though looking like a bean counter (which to some degree he is) the mob go-between portrayed by Richard Jenkins comes in a close second. One of the funnier points of ""Killing Them Softly"" is that no one here can keep his mouth shut. Theyre either tooting their own horns about misdeeds or as in the case of New York hit man Mickey (James Gandolfini) going all melancholy about the lovely prostitute that got away. A final cynical riff proves that Jackie too is willing to give himself away. Dominik knows how to make a stunner. In 2007 he delivered one of the best and possibly most overlooked films of the year ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" which starred Pitt as the Missouri outlaw and Casey Affleck as the bitter sycophant Ford. Shot by Greig Fraser ""Killing Them Softly"" is nearly as striking. Composer Marc Streitenfeld weaves a rich at times discordant tapestry out of piano ambient music and Depression-era songs like ""Its Only a Paper Moon."" With Gandolfini and Liotta in pivotal roles the casting works like a pop-culture madeleine recalling mobsters past. Though ultimately as crafted as ""Killing Them Softly"" is its less satisfying than either ""The Sopranos"" or ""Goodfellas."" Still Dominik and his cast cruise some very mean streets indeed.

Higgins will likely get a kick out of ""Killing Them Softly"" a recession-era reworking of his ""Cogans Trade"" starring a (literally) bang-up cast that includes Brad Pitt as a cucumber-cool mob enforcer Ray Liotta as a mob-protected card-game dealer Richard Jenkins as a button-down mob go-between and James Gandolfini as a hit man on the skids.The recessionary context is a bit overdone - too many clips of George W. Bush and President Obama delivering pronouncements - and the conceit that crime is a business like any other business is timeworn. Also the films violence quotient is I think a notch too high for its purposes.But the dialogue is sharp and so are the performances. Andrew Dominik directed this neo-noir in a low-key comic style thats alternately gritty and fancy. The gritty stuff is best.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 30 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 30 2012 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Andrew Dominik Written by Andrew Dominik George V. Higgins Starring Brad Pitt Ray Liotta James Gandolfini Richard Jenkins Classification R Genre drama A stick-up of a high-stakes mob card game triggers a crisis of confidence in the criminal underworld in Killing Them Softly. New Zealand-born Australian director Andrew Dominiks followup to his well-regarded 2007 western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a stylish brutal affair that delivers grim atmosphere and punishing violence but loses impact in telegraphing its political punches. Screen grab from the online trailer for ""Killing Them Softly"" Movies Killing Them Softly The official trailer The movie is adapted from the 1974 novel Cogans Trade by the late criminal lawyer and author George V. Higgins (The Friends of Eddie Coyle). The book is filled with lengthy stretches of flavourful wiseguy dialogue as Higgins explores the paradoxes of the honour-among-thieves code. Dominik has extracted some of that sharp lingo as well as the general plot of Higginss book in a smart vehicle for producer-star Brad Pitt who plays smooth-operating mob middle manager Jackie Cogan.Jackies job is to restore the syndicates shaky street cred while working with the gangland equivalent of an impotent bureaucracy. With the unnamed towns top man on his death bed the crime bosses are in the hands of an out-of-touch corporate-style committee that issues decisions through its mouthpiece lawyer (Richard Jenkins).Pitt is solid as the cocksure pragmatist who prefers to kill victims ""softly"" from a distance rather than watching them get ""touchy feely"" up close. The sometimes too-colourful cast is led by James Gandolfini resurrecting the spirit of Tony Soprano as a boozing hooker-loving hit man who has lost his killer touch. The thugs include the fearful Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and the junkie Australian Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) both repeat losers who seem destined to fail before they start. Theyre backed by a dry cleaner named Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) who insist its important that they act fast before ""other smart guys"" get the same idea.It will be no surprise to fans of The Assassination of Jesse James that Dominik is arty even indulgently stylish in creating a world of nighttime illuminated with spots of painterly radiance set in bars and cars and dark industrial suburbs (shot in New Orleans). The soundtrack is filled with anachronistic tunes from country spirituals to Depression-era cheer. One scene - of Russell going in and out of consciousness while on heroin - is a standalone set piece of time-shifting distorted imagery and sound.Most of the film consists of long scenes of back-and-forth dialogue alternating with spasmodic scenes of ugly hard-to-watch violence. Ray Liotta the likeable guy who runs the poker game and is wrongly fingered for the heist takes a particularly mean beating - every punch and kick hurts to hear. A slow-motion drive-by shooting offers a series of bullets spraying glass and a Zapruder-style brain splash.So much style such cruelty ... and what is the point again? Dominiks message is hard to dodge in Killing Them Softly - that capitalism and crime are mirror images of the same immoral system (a point Frances Ford Coppolas The Godfather made 40 years ago). There doesnt seem to be anywhere in the film these lowlifes can go without George Bush or John McCain or Barack Obama talking on the television about the need to bail out Wall Street or how everyone in America can participate in the countrys promise.Jackies cynical declaration on the night of Obamas election that ""America isnt a country its a business"" is meant to sting. By that point its just a postscript on a familiar rant less an example of killing us softly than subjecting us to strident overkill.

(WEINSTEIN) People sit around gambling and then lose it all to a few crooks. This is bad for business; now nobody wants to gamble. So the big guys who run all the games call in some muscle planning to sacrifice a few lambs and pump up the rubes confidence so the games can go on. This is basically the story of ""Killing Them Softly."" And maybe of the American economic meltdown. To Andrew Dominik anyway the talented filmmaker behind the new Brad Pitt crime drama the plots are one and the same. Some people play with cards. Some do it with stocks. But its all a game. And because the game needs to go on sometimes you need a little stimulus package. Except in this case the stimulus package is a gun and the guy carrying it has his own ideas of how to jumpstart things. You can appreciate the film on that very deliberate level and certainly Dominik wants you to; hes updated the film from author George V. Higgins original `70s setting and intercut snatches of speeches from Bush and Obama (and has his hitman sneering at it all). But if those cynical politics dont fit yours you can also enjoy the film as simply a bit of stylishly shot nicely acted hardboiled noir. Theres the pleasure of watching Ray Liotta as a mid-level gangster the kind of guy who probably thinks of himself as a ""Goodfellas"" character but is instead just a sweating desperate little schnook tolerated by the big guys - but not when he starts losing them money. Or James Gandolfini back in shoulder harness as a hitman - but a hitman so drunken degenerate and dysfunctional itll be a wonder if Pitt can ever actually pry him out of his hotel room and send him lumbering after his target. And theres Pitt himself reunited with his director from the fine ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" and enjoying the hot violence as much as his cool banter with crooked lawyer Richard Jenkins (who wouldnt be out of place in ""The Asphalt Jungle"" a movie which also saw crime as just a ""left-handed"" kind of capitalism). Some of this - the incredibly filthy but funny dialogue the fast but furious bloodshed - may seem tired now. Weve had decades of Scorsese taking it straight and Tarantino making it meta and all the lesser imitators who followed in their wake. But Dominik often finds fresh approaches. Like the way he layers the soundtrack not only with red-white-and-blue promises but with rust-belt industrial noise and cheesy pop. Or lets the screen nearly go white as a junkie totters on the brink of an O.D. or lets characters seem to find their own destinies independent of the plot. Of course there is a plot a very basic one Somone has screwed up and someone is going to pay and none of it has anything to do with who was really hurt or who was truly responsible. That simply doesnt matter. Theres too much at stake for the game not to be kept going and the suckers to keep getting steered into the con. But who those suckers are - and what the biggest con really is - is up to you to decide. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence gore sexual situations strong language and drug and alcohol abuse. Killing Them Softly (R) Weinstein (97 min.) Directed by Andrew Dominik. With Brad Pitt James Gandolfini Ray Liotta.

Photo James Gandolfini doesnt have a lot to do in the slow ""Killing Them Softly."" ( ) Killing Them Softly"" is already a historical curiosity Itll go down as the first and last gangster picture about the Romney presidency. Im being slightly unfair and Andrew Dominiks hit-man film does offer plenty of allegorical fodder for both left and right. But it isnt much of a movie. I might forgive the slow start if it werent for the slow middle and slow end. Dominik who previously mesmerized me with the superb ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" uses a George Higgins novel to launch a familiar saga about a pair of low-IQ lowlifes (Scoot McNairy Ben Mendelsohn) who think theyre smart enough to rob some very heavy dudes who play in a poker game hosted by the slightly less moronic Markie (Ray Liotta). Brad Pitt giving an uninteresting cool-guy performance hes done many times before is the cruelly efficient hit man who gets called in to administer punishment for all this to the satisfaction of the mob. And thats pretty much the whole story modestly jazzed up with occasional wry dialogue thats about two-thirds as good as Elmore Leonards (which is about two-thirds as good as Quentin Tarantinos). This stuff is not exactly original but Dominik thinks hes got a really funky coat of paint to put on it He sees everything as a metaphor for the autumn 2008 financial crisis and the election of Barack Obama. In case you miss the intent there is an excerpt from an Obama speech in the opening seconds. Theres a shot of dueling Obama and John McCain billboards. As the movie goes on in the background theres always a video or audio clip of Obama or George W. Bush. And at the end theres a big Pitt speech (while he watches Obama on election night) tying politics to crime. This is Dominiks third movie but putting your themes in all capital letters and putting the capital letters in neon is a rookie mistake. Worse than the plodding pace (every scene goes on too long characters such as James Gandolfinis assistant assassin drift in and out without making a mark) and the blaring obviousness (the Velvet Underground song ""Heroin"" backs up a scene about . . . heroin?) is this Im not even sure Dominik knows exactly what hes saying. Thats right Hes vague and loud at the same time like the barstool sage on his 15th vodka. The wised-up killers in the movie say theyre far too clever to be suckered by Obamas golden words about community. Change were told is a myth Theres only the logic of power and money. (Dominik ends the film in a hack move with the song ""Money (Thats What I Want)."") Youre a fool for believing otherwise and for Obama to be replaced the very month of this films release by a venture capitalist would have been the ideal coda for the film. That didnt like ""Killing Them Softly"" quite work out. This kind of acutely undergraduate thinking works fine to give some heft or at least faux heft to a pop song. (""A man with a briefcase can steal more money than any man with a gun"" -- Don Henley. ""Steal a little and they throw you in jail steal a lot and they make you king"" -- Bob Dylan. Etc. etc. etc.). We ask a film for more complexity. Hit man Jackie (Pitt) argues that the host of the poker game who previously stole from his own guests must die for the sake of appearances even though he is not responsible for the second robbery because poker activity has seized up out of fright. Dominik plays this against liquidity in the financial system drying up in 2008 because banks are afraid to loan to one another. Clever only not On Wall Street who gets whacked? The problem with 2008 is it wasnt just one person who needed to have his brains splattered in the elegant super slo-mo of Dominiks most visually captivating scene. It was the entire crazy mortgage system that was broken from lenders to people who bought more house than they could afford to regulators who encouraged them. The financial crisis wasnt ""Goodfellas."" It was ""Murder on the Orient Express.""

And while these two scenes arent the only parts of the movie that work the occasional moments of brilliance are far outweighed by the constant references to 2008s economic collapse and bank bailout. Having the radio or TV report this news once or twice to make a point about organized crime and capitalism? Fine. Shoehorning it into the film a dozen or so times? Enough already. ""Killing"" based on George V. Higgins novel ""Cogans Trade"" follows the ripple effect of a hold-up on a mob-run card game. Johnny (Vincent Curatola best known as Johnny Sack from ""The Sopranos"") sends low-lifes Frankie (Scoot McNairy ""Argo"") and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn ""Animal Kingdom"") to rob a poker game run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). Markie you see suffered a previous robbery but then later revealed that he was the mastermind behind the crime. Johnny figures that if one of Markies games gets hit again everyone will assume that Markie is responsible. And Johnnys right. Enter Jackie summoned by the enigmatic Driver (Richard Jenkins) a guy so far up the chain that he comes off more like a district manager than a made man. They know that Markie is innocent but the situation calls for him to be punished anyway since perception is that he was the organizer. But theres also Frankie and Russell and Johnny to be dealt with so Jackie brings in Mickey who may or may not be up to the job of discreetly taking care of business. The whole witty-gunman thing has been done to excess in the 20 years since ""Reservoir Dogs"" but one would have hoped that writer-director Andrew Dominik coming off the brilliant and underrated ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" might have injected some new life into this sagging genre. And while the cast is consistently watchable and on-point Dominik disappoints as both scenarist and filmmaker. The plotting is wobbly the narrative runs out of steam -- and seriously all the banking stuff gets unbearable after a while. (Mobsters apparently watch ""Charlie Rose"" and C-Span 24/7 if this movie is to be believed.) So while youll be seeing snippets of this film when cast members eventually start collecting career achievement awards ""Killing Me Softly"" isnt going to blow too many people away.

Director Andrew Dominik (137) R Language violence. Area theaters. The connection between gangsters and American aspiration isnt new. From ""The Godfather"" to ""Once Upon a Time in America"" to ""Goodfellas"" to ""The Sopranos"" weve seen the dark underbelly and it is us. A decade before Daniel Day-Lewis was Lincoln his Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"" had an American Flag-decorated glass eye that said it all. What the visceral new drama ""Killing Them Softly"" brings to the table is appreciation for in this films view our constructed sense of community the officious fronts we put up -- and the ways we brutalize each other. On the eve of the 2008 election squeaky flunkies Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) are hired by a thick-fingered New Orleans heist man Johnny Amato (Vince Curatola) to rob a mob-associated card game. Amato figures theyll get away with it since the games organizer the mid-level foot soldier Markie (Ray Liotta) has a rep for messing up. The plan is for Markie to become the suspect. But things easily go south on messy jobs like this and especially for messy people like Russell an Australian wild card who wants to use his share of the money to move into drug-dealing. When Russell and Frankie are found out the mob has a pencil-pushing lawyer (Richard Jenkins) bring in hit men Jackie (Brad Pitt) and Mickey (James Gandolfini) to take care of things. Except that Mickey is a screw-up too. Mickey is a guy who trundles into town sullen and sloppy before checking into a hotel drinking too much and insulting a prostitute. So Jackie becomes the fixer because under his scruffy appearance hes a true-blue pro. Writer-director Andrew Dominik directed Pitt in 2007s ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."" Adapting a 70s novel by George V. Higgins the author of ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" Dominik lays the commentary on lightly. Its even unnecessary at times. As political slogans about ""one America"" play on barroom TVs and shout from billboards the violence empty streets and shady dealings show another reality. Pitt entering his third decade of fame continues to show how there was always a deadly serious actor in him all along. Worn out but with an underlying humanity and work ethic -- the title refers to how he does his hits -- Pitt makes Jackie a scruffily generous soul. Beside him Gandolfini nicely plays up the sad-sack shlumping of a big man laid low. And while McNairy and Mendelsohn are solid but almost too showy Liotta Jenkins Sam Shepard and a chewy supporting cast beautifully fill in the blanks. ""Killing Them Softly"" adds each of its characters to a punchy prosaic tale that believes in America one way or another. Magic Moment A slow-motion smackdown that hammers home the harshness of the crime.

Starring Brad Pitt James Gandolfini and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Andrew Dominik. (R. 97 minutes.) ""Killing Them Softly"" draws a parallel between the world of street thugs and hit men and that of bankers and financiers with a story about a crisis of confidence in a small gambling market in the fall of 2008. As Barack Obamas soaring rhetoric fills the soundtrack we see a ratty-looking guy who looks as if hed slept in his clothes walking in an abandoned stadium. The question is which one is the real America - the one we hear about in the speech or the one were looking at? Guys get greedy and do stupid things. In this case a hood-businessman (Vincent Curatola) gets the bright idea to hire two idiots - knuckleheads you wouldnt trust to squeegee your windshield - to rob players at a mob-run high-stakes card game. The immediate result? It makes everybody afraid to play cards. It freezes the market impedes the cash flow. Something must be done to rescue the economy. Brad Pitt plays the architect of the solution a hit man and fixer who comes to town with an idea of how to get people gambling again. He tells the representative of the card players a mild-mannered corporate type (Richard Jenkins) that they need to kill the guys who actually did the robbery (thats obvious) but also the innocent party that most people wrongly think did the robbery. That second suggestion contains some of the brilliance of ""Killing Them Softly"" When you have a financial crisis confidence must be restored no matter what.

He has a couple of long tense scenes opposite Brad Pitt in ""Killing Them Softly."" Photo Melinda Sue Gordon The Weinstein Company Killing Them Softly review Pitt never better 1 / 3 Back to Gallery ""Killing Them Softly"" based on the George V. Higgins novel ""Cogans Trade"" was adapted and directed by Andrew Dominik who made one of the finest Westerns of the last 50 years ""The Assassination of Jesse James."" ""Killing Them Softly"" is not a masterpiece on that scale but its safe to say that there is not one moment in the film that doesnt represent the directors carefully considered thought whether were talking about acting values camera placement sound or style of presentation. In one scene a guy has a life-and-death conversation with an associate who is high on heroin and Dominik films it through the consciousness of the stoned person. So between lines of dialogue Dominik shows us the kaleidoscopic vortex that the stoned guy keeps getting sucked into and out of. The effect is funny - much of ""Killing Them Softly"" is extremely funny but never in a cute way as in a Guy Ritchie movie and never in a self-consciously clever way as in Martin McDonaghs ""Seven Psychopaths."" The humor here doesnt gloss over character; it reveals it. Brad Pitt is in ecstasy here despite the cool demeanor throughout. This is an actor who is never better and never happier than when he gets to be seedy slick his hair back and wear a leather jacket. Its probably a handsome-guy thing - John Barrymore was like that too a leading man who loved to be a character actor. Its strange to say this about someone who has been insanely popular for 20 years but Pitt may be coming into his own right around now. His exterior and his interior are just beginning to converge. James Gandolfini as a hit man from out of town appears in a pair of long scenes both of them opposite Pitt and both directed to milk maximum tension from fairly routine situations. The beauty of Gandolfini as an actor is that he is a high-strung instrument within an imposing facade. He looks as if it would be very easy to hurt his feelings - and that would be a big mistake. There might be nothing more scary in the contemporary screen than the sight of Gandolfini smiling while his eyes are not smiling at all. The original novel that formed the source of ""Killing Them Softly"" was published in 1974. That means that all the parallels between the story and the financial crisis are the creation of the writer-director. These parallels at first seem arbitrary but the more you think about them the more appropriate and heartfelt they seem. Together they make ""Killing Them Softly"" into something with an extra edge - something deeper and more ambitious than just another crime picture.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Killing Them Softly Too Many Slow-Motion Bullets Not Enough Unglamorous Desperation Killing Them Softly Too Many Slow-Motion Bullets Not Enough Unglamorous Desperation Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 29 2012 751 PM Killing Them Softly George V. Higgins deserves better. By Dana Stevens Ben Mendelsohn and Scoot McNairy in Killing Them Softly Courtesy The Weinstein Company. The novels of George V. Higgins--a onetime Boston prosecuting attorney who had a long second career as a crime novelist--take place in a singularly unglamorous criminal subculture a ragtag network of small-time crooks thats too loosely structured to qualify as an ""underworld."" Even by the standards of noir fiction Higgins moral universe is a dingy and barren place where every semicompetent hustler lives and dies alone and every human relationship is an undisguised transaction. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Friends of Eddie Coyle a 1973 film based on Higgins first published novel and directed by Peter Yates offered a stark unsparing portrait of the low-level gangsters life as an insecure low-paid and perpetually perilous freelance job. Andrew Dominiks new movie Killing Them Softly adapted by Dominik from Higgins third novel Cogans Trade tries to mine a similar vein of workaday fatalism but the film is ultimately done in by Dominiks bursts of directorial grandiosity (already in evidence in his overly fussy last film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford). Its hard to deglamorize the criminal life when you cant resist showing a bullet leaving a gun barrel in stylized super-slow motion or scoring the anti-heros first entrance to a Johnny Cash song. At least I think Brad Pitt as the taciturn hitman Jackie Cogan is meant to be the anti-hero of Killing Them Softly. Its one of the movies structural weaknesses that we never really find a character on whom to hang either our sympathy or our antipathy. Im all for movies that offer up a morally ambiguous less-than-likeable cast of characters--The Friends of Eddie Coyle did exactly that with a protagonist (played by Robert Mitchum) who could veer scene to scene from admirable to despicable to pitiable. But too many of Killing Them Softlys half a dozen main characters come off as interchangeably nasty dullards who arent worth caring about enough to either love or hate. Advertisement Pitts Jackie doesnt enter the film until a half-hour or so in; we spend the opening act in the company of Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) a pair of inept hoods who are hired by Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amato (The Sopranos Vincent Curatola) to knock over an ongoing card game hosted by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). Squirrels plan--one that he foolishly asserts is foolproof--is to proceed on the assumption that Trattman will take the fall for the robbery since hes known to have arranged for an inside-job holdup of his own game in the past. The scene in which Russell and Frankie (barely) pull off the job is the movies best a rare moment of raw gritty suspense unaugmented by flashy directorial flourishes. Soon after though things start to go south for the robbers the robbed and the audience all at once. Russell a not-so-high-functioning heroin addict brags about the card-game holdup to a fellow lowlife and soon theres a contract out on both his and Frankies lives. Trattman is as predicted widely assumed to be in on the heist resulting in a menacing visit from ice-in-his-veins local boss Dillon (Sam Shepard). All the while Dominiks camera goes on an unpleasantly manic bender zooming into and out of blackness to evoke the headrush of a heroin trip or slowing down to Matrix-level frame speed for a self-consciously luxurious bullet-in-the-head shot. The scenes involving Russell have a tendency to wallow in the characters abjection Hes shown coated in a permanent donut glaze of junkie sweat with frequent close-ups on his sketchy teeth. Similarly when James Gandolfini shows up late in the game as a once-reliable hit man lost to depression and alcoholism--a character so miserable he makes you pray Tony Soprano did die in that last scene of the series--the camera lingers on his pasty sagging face almost voyeuristically treating him more as an object lesson (see what happens if you let the contract-killer life get to you?) than a character. Pitt and Gandolfini facing off as two temperamentally opposite assassins--one hypercontrolled one impulsive and volatile--should have been the movies dramatic high point; instead their two scenes together feel like setups for a confrontation that never happens. (The movie which runs only 97 minutes often seems edited down from a longer version; scene by scene it drags but several of the story arcs feel truncated.) Killing Them Softly is about as subtle as a lead pipe to the shins. As Russell and Frankie shoot up the smack theyve bought with their share of the holdup money the soundtrack obediently serves up the Velvet Undergrounds ""Heroin."" But the films most misbegotten gambit may have been the decision to take Higgins heist-gone-wrong story out of 1970s Boston and relocate it in 2008 New Orleans the better to profit from the symbolic windfall of both Hurricane Katrina and the financial crash. From the earliest frames conversations about the price of contract killing and whos dropping a dime on whom are conducted beneath campaign billboards for Obama and John McCain or over the drone of car-radio talking heads discussing the ethics of the financial bailout. (For a bunch of thugs these guys listen to a good bit of political news.) In the movies facepalm-worthy final scene a bar TV broadcasts Obamas election-night speech as one character explicitly lays out for another all the ways in which the power plays among these money-grubbing gangsters are a metaphor for American capitalism itself. Dominiks eagerness to make everything in his film stand for something larger causes the director to lose sight of the very quality that makes George V. Higgins books worth adapting in the first place the ability to let his characters be nothing other than the venal vulnerable life-sized humans they are.

Its a severe and stylish movie whose connection to the real world is almost entirely metaphorical and it suffers from a nearly terminal case of undergraduate nihilist philosophy. For all its crime-movie archetypes - hitmen mobsters lowlife petty criminals dingy American automobiles - and the presence of such iconic stars as Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini dont let anyone tell you its a thriller or an ""action movie."" Those terms imply an entirely different kind of plot and pacing than you get in ""Killing Them Softly"" which despite plenty of graphic bloodshed and a heist-gone-wrong story is closer in spirit to a 1970s art-house film than a crime caper.I wouldnt even go so far as to claim that I enjoyed ""Killing Them Softly"" while I was watching it but it has a weird buzzing intense quality that has burrowed its way deep into my brain like some invasive sci-fi organism. This is a deliberately chilly and nerve-wracking experience and one of the bleakest portraits of American society seen on-screen in the last several decades. Even more than in Dominiks controversial slow-motion western ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" this is a portrayal of a world emptied of emotion and dominated by impersonal greed and instrumental violence. (Dominik works deliberately and expensively This is only the 45-year-old New Zealanders third feature after ""Jesse James"" and his 2000 debut ""Chopper."")Jackie the sharp-dressed sideburned mob enforcer played by Pitt is vaguely regretful about all the people he has to kill; as the movies title suggests he prefers to limit the trauma he inflicts on his victims largely because its also less stressful for him. His general demeanor throughout all the mayhem suggests a decent chain-store manager afflicted by bureaucratic morons from above and incompetent employees from below. Pitt of course also starred in ""Assassination of Jesse James"" and has said its one of his favorite roles; perhaps he appreciates the way Dominik casts him in iconic roles that dont necessarily flatter him or play to his obvious charms. If Jackies the best-looking guy in the movie and its nominal protagonist thats more about staying on-task in a universe of screw-ups than it is about decency let alone heroism. (Jackie joins Matthew McConaugheys corrupt homicide cop in ""Killer Joe"" as the years most charismatic antiheroes.)In the world of ""Killing Them Softly"" its 2008 and yet it isnt. Everywhere we go in the unidentified and hollowed-out American city where the story unfolds - the movie was shot in New Orleans but we see none of that citys iconic landmarks and almost no black people; its more like a dream-state version of Cleveland or Buffalo - TVs and radios are playing news of the financial collapse or broadcasting debates between John McCain and Barack Obama. Dominik who also wrote the screenplay arguably leans a bit too hard on the symbolism here The real-world rot of Americas fundamental institutions has trickled down to a bunch of dead-end mobsters in this lugubrious crime-movie world an imaginary space that simultaneously suggests David Finchers ""Se7en"" Michelangelo Antonionis ""Red Desert"" and a Tarantino movie slowed down on ludes with all the pop-culture jokes taken out. You Might Also Like Mind you it seems unlikely that Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) the two stringy-haired losers we meet first in ""Killing Them Softly"" have any idea who Barack Obama is or what the hell is happening on Wall Street. (Other than the fact that guys in good clothes are making money and theyre not perhaps.) A loudmouth wannabe crime boss named Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola aka Johnny Sack from ""The Sopranos"") talks them into sticking up a mob-sponsored poker game run by Markie Trattman (the ever creepier Ray Liotta) a mid-level operator who somehow survived an episode in which he robbed his own game years earlier. Johnnys assumption is that the bosses will take out their frustration on Markie shrug off the losses and move on. Like low-level financial gamesters the world over he is unable to see the future beyond his next few thousand bucks and his assumption is only partly correct.Ive already made it sound way too much as if ""Killing Them Softly"" was driven by plot. In fact the story largely follows a mostly predictable arc and the experience of watching it is dominated by the scum-coated rain-soaked cityscapes (photographed by the suddenly hot Aussie cinematographer Greig Fraser who also shot Kathryn Bigelows ""Zero Dark Thirty"") the deliberately disorienting point-of-view shots and the eruptions of gruesome violence often seen in poetic slow motion. Jackie gets to town to clean up the mess left behind by Markie Johnny the two deadbeat thieves and pretty much everybody else and finds himself uniformly disappointed and let down. His principal point of contact is an apologetic middle-manager type played by the reliably terrific Richard Jenkins who approaches the challenges of organized crime with a Dilbert-like lack of fervor. Its a business like any other and you have to deal with jerks. Both he and Jackie seem to work for a boss named Dillon who makes only one brief appearance (a cameo for Sam Shepard) and then disappears altogether. In its own unrelenting fashion ""Killing Them Softly"" is a kind of comedy as exemplified by the appearance of James Gandolfini as a legendary killer called New York Mickey summoned by Jackie to handle a hit he wants to contract out. Pitt and Gandolfinis terrific scene in a deserted airport bar as Mickey pounds beers and cocktails without a seconds pause and Jackie gradually realizes that even his trustworthy old friend has gone sour sums up this movies strengths and weaknesses in a nutshell including the fact that it does nothing to advance the so-called plot. This is Gandolfini at his meanest and most unstable and completes his trifecta of supporting roles this season (the others being as a disappointed suburban dad in David Chases ""Not Fade Away"" and Leon Panetta in ""Zero Dark Thirty."")You could say Dominik is making an overly obvious point Crime is business and business is crime and the whole thing has pretty much gone down the crapper. Except Im not sure thats the point at all; the political and economic metaphors employed in ""Killing Them Softly"" strike me as window dressing on a symbolic drama thats reaching for grand existential meaning and not quite getting there. At minimum its a flawed but compelling drama with a terrific cast and a strange undertow that will leave you eager to see it again and even more eager to see what Dominik comes up with next.

"Killing Them Softly review Brad Pitt is smooth but film isnt - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Brad Pitt is smooth but Killing Them Softly isntThe actor impresses as hit man Jackie but director Andrew Dominik is none too subtle about the films ideas.November 29 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic News reports of economic woes and misbegotten corporate schemes play like a soundtrack in ""Killing Them Softly"" a moody crime noir starring Brad Pitt as a New Orleans hit man dealing with a down market bad bets and loose change.Though the notion of crime as a business is nothing new the film uses the machinations and motivations of the Big Easys underworld to mirror contemporary corporate Americas decline down to the difficult bosses. Yes the ""layoffs"" tend to be more lethal but the severance packages often call for delicate negotiations that sound all too familiar.Director Andrew Dominik who last worked with Pitt on 2007s western saga ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" thankfully gets down to business in half the time here. But in adapting George V. Higgins novel ""Cogans Trade"" the writer-director becomes so intent on hammering home the parallels between economic decay political disappointments and petty criminals there is nothing soft or subtle about it. He should trust his audience more.PHOTOS Killing Them Softly red carpet premierePitt however is smooth as silk as Jackie the go-to guy when bad numbers have a major mess in need of a cleanup. Hes joined by some of the usual suspects youd expect to find in a mob lineup including Ray Liotta James Gandolfini and ""Sopranos"" alums Vincent Curatola and Max Casella.But first we meet the mess.From the films opening scenes you know these are marked men. Frankie (an excellent Scoot McNairy) is a small-time grifter in a perpetual state of anxiety. His pal Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) wearing the sweaty sheen of a smack addict looks worse. Frankie is newly out of jail and being conned into a double-dealing job by Johnny ""Squirrel"" Amato (Curatola). Squirrels got a foolproof plan that involves a mob-protected card game run by popular local tough Markie (Liotta). And now hes got two fools.Frankie does most of the talking and his particular brand of misery settles in like a low-grade fever and drives the film. A flat rasp on the edge of a whine lank limbs in a perpetual shrug he never thought to have the American dream but he hungers for it anyway. Russell is in a continual state of cocky resistance and ensuring his next high. At the moment hes paying for his habit by boosting purebred dogs and the sight of this jacked-up junkie walking a jewel-collared Chihuahua down a ghetto street is both comical and incredibly sad. The card-parlor heist which goes terribly right and terribly wrong has that same duality.As much as ""Killing Me Softly"" is about low-level street thugs and their various sins it is also about the fine art of negotiation. As the continual news loop of the countrys problems plays relentless in filling up the background noise everyone in this mini-microcosm of hard times is talking their way in or out of some kind of difficulty. Even Jackie the one man in New Orleans who never seems to break a sweat.Hes been enlisted to track down the two kids and figure out whose hands are really dirty and whose simply need slapping. Driver (a wry Richard Jenkins) is the crime machines middleman soft voice big stick nice suit. As Jackie and Driver circle the issues a Jackies fees the mobs needs a its like listening to a couple of merger and acquisitions guys sparring.PHOTOS Killing Them Softly red carpet premiereThis case is dicey enough that Jackie wants a backup shooter. Enter Mickey (Gandolfini) lumbering into town intent on drinking his weight in martinis and bedding every working girl he can. Oh how I have missed Tony Soprano. Its not that Gandolfini doesnt make Mickey his own man a he does a fine job creating a far more defensive creature a its just that while Gandolfini can make any mobster tick Tony remains the unforgettable one.Despite all the esoteric links to Washington and Wall Street a images of Barack Obama and John McCain circa 2008 hover Big Brother-like on the TV monitors everywhere a this is still a movie about mobsters and so there will be blood. The director has proved to have a taste for it in the tradition of Peckinpah and Tarantino. It makes for violence that is exceedingly brutal and at times eerily beautiful.The beatings have all the pent-up rage of people with nothing to lose a as faces become mush its hard not to look away. The beauty comes when Dominik slows things down and selects just the right bluesy pop song for accompaniment a ""Love Letters (Straight from Your Heart)"" has never been more soulful. Then a bullets trajectory and the collateral damage it causes or the world seen through Russells smack-saturated fog a becomes mesmerizing with director of photography Greig Fraser doing a spot-on job. The slides into slo-mo and the different points of view can leave you feeling unbalanced but this is a story about lives out of balance so it mostly works.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESKilling Them Softly director My movie isnt for everyoneNovember 30 2012Killing Them Softly has deft cast heavy hand critics sayNovember 30 2012Fall Sneaks listSeptember 2 2012Producer creating indie film boomMay 19 2012Ogres soldiers gorillasMay 9 2004MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentNew OrleansCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-killing-them-softly-review-20121130,0,1929962.story",200,killingthemsoftly17,killingthemsoftly,latimes
"Killing Them Softly review Recession-era zombie gangsters | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesKilling Them Softly review Recession-era zombie gangstersBrad Pitt plays a disillusioned mob hit man in Killing Them Softly a film that likens the 2008 economic meltdown to the draining of mens souls.Brad Pitt is the dissatisfied hit man Jackie Cogan in Killing Them Softly.  (Alliance Films)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 29 2012Killing Them Softly (out of 4)Starring Brad Pitt James Gandolfini Richard Jenkins Ray Liotta Ben Mendelsohn and Scoot McNairy. Written and directed by Andrew Dominik. 97 minutes. Opens Nov. 30 at major theatres. 18AThis is the dead landThis is cactus landArticle Continued Below--T. S. Eliot The Hollow MenThey are indeed empty vessels these drained gangsters of Andrew Dominiks Killing Them Softly.Theyre guys who would steal a waiters 1 tip and for whom 1000 might as well be 1 million. They drink to excess and whore around but achieve little satisfaction from either escape.They have vacant eyes zombie hearts and zero conscience. They will pull a trigger smash a face or betray a pal but theres no serious intent. Theres just opportunity money and above all business.Business has been bad lately. Its the fall of 2008 in post-Katrina New Orleans and despite the constant chatter about ""the American promise"" from presidential candidate Barack Obama few people are dreaming big.Its a time of hesitation doubt and fear. Gangsters drive around in 40-year-old gas guzzlers and walk tiny dogs. Theyre feeling the pinch as keenly as the bankers who have driven the economy into the dirt. ""This country is f---ed Im telling you"" says mob hit man Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) who is disgusted by what he sees. He still possesses a modicum of self-respect but its started to fade. He has to clean up the mess of incompetent dirty work.He sees idiots like Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) doing idiotic things like knocking over a backroom poker game between members of the mob. The game is run by another idiot Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) who previously arranged to have another of his mob games robbed and bragged about it. Guess who is going to be blamed for this one?There are elements of Scorseses grime and Tarantinos wit in Killing Them Softly and the story source is the 1974 novel Cogans Game by George V. Higgins. But writer/director Dominik has his own methods. Hes brilliant at using atmosphere and attitude to set up a scene as he also showed in Chopper and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.This is a deeply cynical movie with not much to say but a lot to feel. Everything sinks into your bones like the watered-down colours of cinematographer Greig Frasers palette. Like the deep funk of Pitts disillusioned Cogan. Like the economic meltdown that siphons wallets and then souls.Obamas talk of ""hope"" and ""change"" blares from every blurry barroom TV screen as well as George W. Bushs final excuses but nobody here is feeling energized.Theres an election coming but also a reckoning Johnny Cashs apocalyptic ""The Man Comes Around"" plays on the soundtrack and that man isnt Jesus its Cogan.Hes been hired to settle a few scores regarding the poker-game robbery. He gives the films title meaning as he describes his technique ""I like to kill them softly from a distance. Not close enough for feelings.""But hes feeling something frustration. His fellow enforcer (James Gandolfini) whom hes summoned to town for assistance seems more interested in getting smashed and laid. Cogans mob contact Driver (Richard Jenkins) keeps sweating the details of the planned hits and also the cost (""Fly coach"").Bullets will eventually fly and blood will flow.

USATODAY 603 p.m. EST November 29 2012A charismatic hired gun played by Brad Pitt does nothing softly in this hyper-violent visually stunning and well-written thriller.Brad Pitt offers a meaty performance as Jackie Cogan in the clever thriller Killing Them Softly.(Photo Melinda Sue Gordon The Weinstein Company)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Brad Pitt Ray Liotta Richard Jenkins James Gandolfini Ben MendelsohnRated R; runtime 1 hour 37 minutes; olpens Friday nationwideAs Wall Street melts down so does the small-time gangster empire in Killing Them Softly.The story is played against the backdrop of the 2008 economic collapse and opens with President Obamas voiceover message of hope eerily contrasted by a lone guy walking through a desolate trash-strewn corner of an anonymous American city.A clever thriller ( out of four; rated R; opening Friday nationwide) with a particularly meaty performance by Brad Pitt it posits a simple theory as expressed by Pitts menacing Mob enforcer Jackie ""Americas not a country. Its just a business.""He expounds further in a key meeting with Richard Jenkins in a wonderfully nuanced role as a Mob lawyer who doesnt get his hands dirty. The pair meet at a bar after a string of murders following a heist at a Mob-controlled poker game. Obamas soaring pledge to reclaim the American dream fills the silence of the bar.FREYDKIN Brad Pitt is a man on the movePREMIERE Pitt is killing it in New YorkPitts Jackie suddenly a political scholar dismisses ""the myth created by Thomas Jefferson"" and scoffs at the notion of an American collective. ""This guy wants to tell me were living in a community. Dont make me laugh. Im living in America and in America youre on your own.""Its a cynical philosophy that underlies this particularly seamy swath of society. Pitt may be the rare thug who discourses on political philosophy (among other things) as the film offers a critique of American capitalism.But other elements make a stronger impression than its disenfranchised nihilist sentiments. Theres an indelible cast of sleazeballs who populate this dark tale written and directed by Andrew Dominik and based on George V. Higgins novel Cogans Trade. James Gandolfini plays a procrastinating hitman (with unavoidable traces of Tony Soprano) Ray Liotta is a hapless poker player and Ben Mendelsohn a drug-addled grifter.Languorous to the point of rambling the story of double-crossing and vengeance is darkly funny graphically violent and gorgeously shot.Occasionally it seems like an exercise in cinematography specifically how to make bullets tearing into flesh look artful through extreme slow-motion camerawork.In one of the films most grisly scenes shot with an unremittingly shaky camera rain pours down while a man endures a frenetic pummeling. The 1930s tune Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries is the incongruous soundtrack.The squeamish be warned It gets worse. A gold-colored bullet moves at an inexorable pace shattering car windows into kaleidoscopic shards and piercing a mans skull with vivid blood splatters worthy of Jackson Pollock.Sometimes a la Quentin Tarantino the movie feels like a collection of overheard conversations such as the one that explains the films title. Sociopathic Jackie determines to keep a distance from his victims ""They get touchy-feely...They cry they plead they beg ... They call for their mothers. It gets embarrassing. I like to kill them softly. From a distance. Not close enough for feelings.Theres nothing touchy-feely about Killing Them Softly a stylish thriller worth seeing -- despite its relentless violence -- for its sharp dialogue mesmerizing photography and gritty performances. 249 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/X4zQg2",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/X6Rs9vM0kDE/,200,killingthemsoftly19,killingthemsoftly,usatoday

Melinda Sue Gordon/The Weinstein Co. hide caption toggle caption Melinda Sue Gordon/The Weinstein Co. Killing Them Softly Director Andrew Dominik Genre Drama Running time 97 minutes Rated R for violence sexual references pervasive language and some drug use With Brad Pitt Ray Liotta Richard Jenkins Watch Clips Get Some Sleep Get Some Sleep Credit The Weinstein Co. Never Been Here Never Been Here Credit The Weinstein Company George Higgins was a Boston-based crime novelist and former assistant U.S. attorney who wrote meaty swaggering dialogue that seems tailor-made for the movies though until now only one of his books had been made into one. That picture Peter Yates 1973 The Friends of Eddie Coyle featured a late-middle-aged Robert Mitchum -- a figure of shopworn masculine beauty -- as low-level hood Eddie. Now Brad Pitt stars as another Higgins character in Andrew Dominiks Killing Them Softly. And if thats not exactly proof that were living in a golden age of movies its at least reassurance that were living in a not-so-tarnished one. Pitts Jackie Cogan is you might say a problem solver. A Grade-Z wiseguy (Vincent Curatola) sends a couple of bumbling ex-cons (Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn) to knock over a mob-run card game an assignment that seems pretty much foolproof given that the dealer (Ray Liotta) is already suffering the scrutiny of his bosses. And sure enough the Mutt-and-Jeff duo despite sitting at the low-wattage end of the dim-bulb scale pull off the theft -- and the mob higher-ups arent happy about it. Its 2008 and the economy has just taken its nosedive; even criminals need to protect their investments. So the big guys send for Jackie to restore order if not peace to the cozy little world of racketeering. He makes his entrance sliding into the passenger seat of a car driven by an anonymous-looking mob middle-manager in a suit and tie (Richard Jenkins) but his own look is studiously casual With his slicked-back pompadour ombre aviator shades and time-softened leather jacket he looks like everyone and no one. He looks like Brad Pitt in the same way Robert Mitchum always looked like Robert Mitchum. Thats a good thing and Andrew Dominik directing his first movie since The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford knows it. Dominik adapted the screenplay himself from Higgins 1974 novel Cogans Trade paying special attention to the books dialogue Even though hes changed the era in which the story takes place the language still rings true to Higgins style. i Ray Liotta plays Markie Trattman a card-game dealer whose racket gets knocked over by two ambitious low-level hoods. The Weinstein Co. hide caption toggle caption The Weinstein Co. Ray Liotta plays Markie Trattman a card-game dealer whose racket gets knocked over by two ambitious low-level hoods. The Weinstein Co. Its the characters and their words that drive the story here and Dominik preserves all their scruffy colors When McNairy and Mendelsohn show up for their little heist all their seemingly paradoxical guilelessness and braggadocio are on display. Mendelsohns character is a dog-napper who aspires to be a dope dealer a guy whose face is perpetually coated with a veil of sweat. McNairy is sweeter but just as clueless. When Pitts Jackie comes for him as is inevitable he wears the look of a puppy whos just relieved himself in the wrong place half embarrassed and half scared. Killing Them Softly has more unruly energy and less art-house pretension than The Assassination of Jesse James. Its disreputability does come with a faintly arty sheen sprayed on -- the picture could be a little grubbier but lets not split hairs especially such nice greasy ones. Dominik and cinematographer Greig Fraser get the setting right The Boston of Killing Them Softly isnt the pretty picturesque one but its Godforsaken fringes a landscape of desolate looping overpasses with nothing much beneath them except scrubby lots and maybe a few warehouses. Dominik does make some of the violence look a little too pretty A bullet pierces a cranium in slow motion resulting in an exploding floret of blood that looks like the garnish on an upscale dinner plate. But elsewhere when a character suffers a brutal beating Dominik takes a more straightforward tack With every punch he makes you feel the price being paid by the guys mug. And then theres Pitt striding through the movie not as if he owned it but as if he knows hes just renting the space -- hes unassuming and confident at once in just the right measures. He also knows what to do with Higgins filtered-through-Dominik dialogue as when he explains to Jenkins his preferred method of killing He doesnt like to fire at close range because it gets too personal. ""I like to kill them softly from a distance"" he says and his voice captures both his sense of practicality and his capacity for sorrow. And Pitt like all good actors -- or perhaps more accurately like all actors who have learned how to be good -- is a terrific listener. In a scene with James Gandolfini as a not-so-helpful colleague he lends an ear as this bummed-out behemoth hoists a martini glass (or two) to his lips and spins a sad tale about how his wife almost divorced him while he was serving a prison sentence. Pitts Jackie takes it all in his face showing sympathy that almost shifts into the territory of empathy. Who is this man and what is he thinking? Pitt doesnt spell it out because he doesnt have to. Hes wearing Jackies back story on the inside which is where it belongs.

(Photo amp; Video Sundance Selects) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Nov. 29 2012 650 p.m. ET Simply stated ""The Central Park Five"" which goes into national release this week is a documentary about five black and Latino teenagers from Harlem who were convicted of a horrific crime they didnt commit--the beating and rape in 1989 of a white woman who had been jogging at night in Manhattans Central Park. But nothing is simple in this painstaking heartbreaking film which was written and directed by Ken Burns with his daughter Sarah Burns and David McMahon. As filmmaking its a departure from Mr. Burnss characteristically measured tone; anger boils beneath the carefully composed surface. As history its a shattering portrait of New York at a time when the city beset by violence and drowning in drugs was frantic to assign blame for a terrible crime that appeared to be not incidentally an interracial crime. As a case study of law gone off the rails its about police and prosecutorial conduct and the conjoined questions of whether the defendants confessions were coerced or whether five boys innocent of the crime simply chose to declare themselves guilty. ENLARGE Accused rapist Yusef Salaam is escorted by police. NY Daily News Archive/Getty Images That they were innocent was officially acknowledged 13 years later when a judge vacated their convictions. By then though the five had served their complete sentences between 6 and 13 years. And their exoneration might never have come if not for a sequence of events that began when Matias Reyes a serial rapist previously known to the police confessed to the Central Park crime and a DNA match confirmed his guilt. Subsequent investigations revealed that DNA tests of the five defendants had come back negative and that their confessions were riddled with what Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau called ""troubling discrepancies."" But the impact of confessions the documentary tells us can be irreversible trumping the results of DNA and for whatever reasons under whatever circumstances the suspects had confessed. (One year after their exoneration each of the men filed a 50 million civil lawsuit against the city of New York as well as police officers and prosecutors who had been involved in their conviction. Those lawsuits mentioned only briefly in the film remain unresolved but the city by way of defending itself recently subpoenaed research and outtakes from the film.) Watching ""The Central Park Five"" is a deeply affecting experience. When we see the films subjects as suspects pouring out their videotaped confessions (which they quickly disavowed after being released from police custody) theyre not only frightened kids but if were to be honest with ourselves frightening kids the sort of urban apparitions--just listen to what they say they did--that would send anyone with an instinct for survival to the other side of a dark street. When we see them as adults we have a strong sense of how theyve suffered; who they might have been if not for a random stroke of fate--""I was at that point of coming into who I was"" one of them says  ""but I never really got there""--and who theyve become. ENLARGE Kharey Wise in The Central Park Five NY Daily News Archive/Getty Images These were not as we learn apprentice angels. On the night of the Central Park rape they were part of a group of kids roaming another part of the park where cyclists were being hassled rocks were being tossed at cars and a homeless man was beaten. But neither were they rapists and they have become over time and against unimaginable odds thoughtful strikingly eloquent and to a man intensely likable. (The most eloquent of the five managed to get a college degree before as one of them notes ""they took education out of prison."") Watching ""The Central Park Five"" is also a deeply troubling experience for the terrified young defendants were demonized to the point of being described as members of a teenage wolf pack that was wilding in the park. ""Wilding"" was a neologism a term that gained instant currency in a city that convicted the five kids long before they went to trial. Its a different city today in a country that sees its racial and social divides with more clarity than it did back then. But the most troubling question the film raises is how clearly we may see even now. Watch a clip from the film ""Killing Them Softly."" Jackie (Brad Pitt) is a professional enforcer who investigates a heist that went down during a mob-protected poker game. Also starring James Gandolfini amp; Ray Liotta. (Photo amp; Video Weinstein Co.) Killing Them Softly Andrew Dominiks ""Killing Them Softly"" is one of those gloomy mood pieces that makes you wonder if the sun will ever come out. In fact sunshine can be detected every now and then but the surprising thing about the prevailing grayness is how it gives way ever so slowly to much darker genuinely doomy and quite beautiful tableaux that evoke Edward Hopper William Eggleston the aestheticized violence of ""The Wild Bunch"" or the elasticized bullet time of ""The Matrix."" Id say the credits got it wrong and the movies star is its cinematographer Greig Fraser even though Brad Pitt is very good in a pivotal role and was mainly responsible for getting the movie made. Another surprising thing is just how elastic time can be. Mr. Dominiks previous film ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" was deliberately paced yet infallibly interesting over the course of 160 minutes. His new one arriving five years later clocks in at 97 minutes and crawls. ENLARGE Brad Pitt The Weinstein Company Mr. Pitt is an enforcer Jackie Cogan whos brought in by the mob to put things right after a couple of dim-bulb thugs throw the local crime economy out of whack by holding up a mob-protected card game. Jackie is forced to work on the cheap because the national economy is also out of whack so hes stuck with a subprime hire a hit man Mickey ( James Gandolfini) whos boozing heavily wallowing in despair and clearly not the efficient monster he once was. Until Mickey makes his entrance ""Killing Them Softly"" which the director adapted from a George V. Higgins novel is a series of character studies about insufficiently intriguing characters. The two thugs played by Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn are supposed to be comically incompetent but theres more incompetence than comedy and lots of fancified dialogue with echoes of David Mamet that particularly afflicts several encounters in which Jackie discusses the sad state of illicit affairs with a midlevel mob manager played by Richard Jenkins. Mickeys character on the other hand warrants studying. Mr. Gandolfini finds so much to play in this scooped-out shell of a brutal nihilist failed romantic and successful misogynist that you can almost forget how often hes played similar roles before. ( Ray Liotta as the card games dealer has also played similar roles before--too many times.) As a gangster thriller ""Killing Them Softly"" is long on violence and short on thrills but it does present a mystery--why Mr. Dominik a gifted New Zealander with a passion for American culture was able to hold our attention so steadfastly in his previous film which went on at such great length and so fitfully in this one. Both films were concerned with character though Mr. Pitt had much more to do as Jesse James and he did it with a marvelous subtlety that was matched by Casey Afflecks spectacular performance as the assassin Bob Ford. Yet ""Jesse James"" was intrinsically dramatic while ""Killing Them Softly"" has been organized around an abstract concept--that the mobs loss of control over its own economic realm mirrors a loss of fiscal and economic control by Washington and Wall Street. (The action is frequently intercut with audio or video clips of President Bush and then President Obama addressing the financial crisis.) Whatever you may think of that concept its only a notion not a dramatic premise which is why the film for all its visual felicities comes to life only sporadically. To find out how such a notion can be dramatized consult ""The Godfather.""

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Were all on our own"" says Scoot McNairy who plays charmingly dim robber Frankie in the crime drama ""Killing Me Softly."" Later Brad Pitt as Jackie Cogan an enforcer sent to knock off some thugs gone rogue paraphrases that emotion lamenting a country gone to hell. Oh the angst of the professional hit man who speaks like an existentialist and behaves like a nihilist. Based on the 1970s Boston-set novel ""Cogans Trade"" considered one of crime writer George V. Higgins best books the film shifts the action to the New Orleans wasteland created by Katrina. Things begin promisingly. Frankie and Russell (versatile Aussie actor Ben Mendelsohn) stick up a Mob-protected card game run by Markie (fetchingly seedy Ray Liotta) another lowlife higher up on the food chain. But after Pitt arrives to straighten things out calling for backup from a New York hit man debauched to the edge of sanity (James Gandolfini) the story begins to unravel into a series of long one-on-one chats. Its ""Mean Streets"" meets ""My Dinner With Andre."" Written and directed by New Zealander Andrew Dominik the films look and performances are unflinchingly realistic. Cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer Patricia Norris create a convincing environment of gritty trash-strewn grayness brightened by the occasional gush of blood. Unlike the flashy glam mobsters of Scorsese-land these mopes lead lives as dreary as their surroundings. They talk about women with predictably mindless misogyny; Dominik was wise not to add any romantic partners (save the fleeting appearance of an ill-treated hooker). With this crowd they would only be unconvincing distractions. But fine acting arty camerawork and compellingly realistic New Orleans locations are nearly drowned out by wincingly obvious metaphors. Everywhere anybody goes radios or TVs are blaring politics. Then-President Bush defends dubious economic policy while Obama -- contextualized as a naive Candide -- spouts hope and change (are a bunch of guys playing high-stakes illegal cards really going to have C-SPAN droning in the background?). The crooks all drive vintage gas-wasting American muscle cars or sedans -- rusty dented some ready for the scrap heap. OK we get it. These ridiculous heavy-handed parallels are unworthy of a first-year film student but typical of some foreign filmmakers who revel in painting American corruption and decay with a brush so broad it flattens complexity and credibility. Weinstein Co. Star Tribune Brad Pitt and Scoot McNairy in ""Killing Them Softly"" Clever dialogue can make up for one-dimensional characters and amped-up action can disguise a thin plot. Here we get too little of either. The pacing often grinds to a halt dissipating the already meager tension. In a movie populated by soulless assassins and inept robbers the characters dont have to be likable. They should though be at least occasionally intriguing or have a surprise or two up their sleeves. Pitt who co-produced and stars is the planet around which everything else is supposed to orbit yet seems only partly present. McNairy with his nasal whine and goofy malleability is the most fun to watch of the bunch and this should be a breakout role for him. The rest of these guys arent quite boring but they have no passion grimly slouching through Gomorrah from one bloodbath to the next. Even mob liaison Richard Jenkins master of quietly commanding attention grows tedious with such facile lines as ""This is a business of relationships."" A meditation on a life of crime it aint -- all the more disappointing because Dominiks previous achievement ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" also starring Pitt was original sophisticated -- and subtle. With a dream cast and such high production values Dominik had the chance to make a more intense and memorable mark.

But it is also doled out with resignation and even regret. Nobody in Andrew Dominiks bloody and bloody entertaining crime film an adaptation of George V. Higgins Cogans Trade wants to inflict bodily harm. Its just what they have to do. Slideshow Killing Them Softly pulpy bloody and funny Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Killing Them Softly >> Killing Them Softly is set in the direst weeks of the 2008 financial crisis when Barack Obama and John McCain were vying for the presidency banks and brokerage houses were collapsing and panic swirled through the air like newspapers in a rotten wind. In fact Killing Them Softly begins with a figure walking down a tunnel into a desolate cityscape of blowing debris and booming sound bites from Obamas inaugural campaign (the sound editing in this film is amazing). The guy is Frankie (Scoot McNairy) a jumpy ex-con heading to meet an even jumpier junkie Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) an Aussie with a dog-napping scheme (yup its a trend - see Seven Psychopaths). Theres a prospective job the brainstorm of Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) also known as the Squirrel to rob a mob-protected card game and these are the guys to pull it off. Its pulpy stuff. The games host Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) is sure to be fingered for the heist - hed jacked his own game once before and then bragged about it. And so Frankie and Russell pull on their stocking masks and rubber gloves and off we go. Enter Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) a professional killer who talks quietly scrutinizing his company with a piercing look and a toothpick in his mouth. He meets with a lawyer for the mob (Richard Jenkins) deciding what to do about this business. Dominik directed Pitt in the loping cowboy tragedy The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and like that film this gangland noir is populated with a band of colorfully shifty supporting players. But where his western aimed for a mythic grace and gravity Dominiks Killing Them Softly is tighter (even as the scenes unfold in long easy takes) and darkly funny. The filmmaker deftly contrasts Higgins gritty thriller about crooks capos and greedheads with whats going on in the world around them corporate crooks corporate capos and corporate greedheads triggering a worldwide economic collapse. Its a neat metaphor and it works. And it still works four years after the worst of it (hopefully) is over. Pitt and Jenkins scenes take place mostly in a car. The two men are cool and collected except when they are not as befits their respective characters and its a gas watching them work. Pitt also shares a couple of fascinatingly tense scenes with James Gandolfini lugging a suitcase through the airport and lugging his Tony Soprano aura along with him. Hes Mickey a hard-drinking gun for hire who badmouths a hooker while Jackie sits there in the hotel room getting worried about Mickeys state of mind. Jolting suspenseful full of twisted sympathy for its goons row of characters and wickedly amusing to boot Killing Them Softly summons up the ghosts of Goodfellas and a whole nasty tradition of crime pics. And then it lets its ghosts go whacking and thwacking away. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com. Read his blog ""On Movies Online"" at www.philly.com/onmovies.

"Movie review Killing Them Softly - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Killing Them Softly cast stands out Share Tweet Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 11.29.12 | 403 PM Andrew Dominiks ""Killing Them Softly"" is a bleakly comic brutally Darwinian gangland saga that at times comes close to being this years ""Drive."" It also does something that if youre from around these parts seems downright perverse. It takes the Boston out of George V. Higgins. Higgins of course was probably the best crime novelist this city has produced -- Dennis Lehane would be the first to agree -- and hes the source for whats still the best Boston crime movie 1972s ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle."" ""Killing Them Softly"" is based on the 1974 novel ""Cogans Trade"" which like all Higginss books is steeped in local flavor. When someone gets a beating in ""Trade"" its not just in a parking lot but in the parking lot behind the old Stearns department store off Route 9 in Chestnut Hill. A hood meets a contract killer not at any restaurant but at Jacob Wirths on Stuart Street (the menu is discussed). Its the kind of book where your fingers smell like stale beer just from turning the pages. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Dominik (""Chopper"" ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"") throws all this out because he has bigger fish to fry. Like the entire sociopolitical history of America. But Ill get to that in a minute. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The plot in ""Killing Them Softly"" is intentionally small-time. A crooked businessman (Vincent Curotola) hires two lowlifes (Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn) to rob a mob-run poker game after which the powers that be bring in a fixer named Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to find out who did it and what to do about it. A number of bodies later Cogans done and so is the story. Its about his professionalism and everybody elses lack thereof and morals have nothing to do with it. Anyone who has read Higgins knows the books are three-quarters dialogue -- foul-mouthed pungent comically stupid almost Joycean in its complexity -- and ""Killing Them Softly"" retains most of that talk the characters engines idling before occasionally revving into the red. You might think the movies aping Quentin Tarantino but its the other way around Higgins along with Elmore Leonard is where Tarantino got most of his shtick. (Higgins for his part got his dialogue from the goons he met while working as a journalist and an assistant United States attorney.) A good actor can do marvelous work with this gift of words and Dominik who adapted the novel himself hands the dialogue out like its Christmas. McNairy and Mendelsohn are appallingly funny as two scuzzballs you hope never to meet in real life the former wheezy and almost touchingly naive the latter just plain mean. Richard Jenkins as the mob lawyer whos Cogans contact creates a fussy little professional fascinated by the criminality hes rubbing up against. Ray Liotta doesnt get a lot of dialogue as Markie Trattman the unlucky proprietor of the card game but he doesnt need it at this point; one look into those bleary goodfella eyes tells us everything we need to know. ""Killing Them Softly"" coasts on banter only to erupt in moments of violence that almost burn your hair off so electrifyingly does Dominik stage and shoot them. That beating mentioned above has a sickening paparazzi immediacy to it and a later hit on a nighttime boulevard (Comm. and Chestnut Hill avenues in the book) is a slo-mo setpiece as beautiful as it is repugnant. In a sense the films a high-end nature documentary Life in the Animal Kingdom. Cogans the star of the story and Pitts the star of the movie; the two click together like custom-fitted machinery. Late in the going someone says to Jackie ""I dont know who the [expletive] you are"" to which he responds ""Very few guys do."" Thats why hes good at his job (i.e. killing people); the characters engaged shark-like efficiency stems from doing only whats necessary even when the mooks keep throwing him curveballs. Pitt doesnt showboat relying on minimal gestures and the watchfulness of his eyes. You like Jackie even as youre horrified by him. Late in the movie James Gandolfini shows up as Mickey a hit man who has seen much better days. Hes everything Cogan isnt stuck in a funk of booze and nostalgia brooding over women functionally useless. All of Gandolfinis scenes breathe a terrible sadness and while ""Killing Them Softly"" appears to slow to a crawl whenever Mickeys onscreen its actually coming close to its point. Which is that the weak suffer at the hands of the strong and anyone who says otherwise is selling you something. Aside from a few local references -- Somerville Wollaston some place called ""Have-erhill"" -- Dominik pulls ""Killing Them Softly"" out of Higginss Boston and sets it in a generic urban wasteland in November of 2008. (The film was actually shot in New Orleans with post-Katrina detritus adding to the sense of decay.) The economic meltdown and the final stages of the presidential campaign are all over the news; during the robbery sequence as the players contemplate their lost winnings George W. Bush is on TV telling the country about the hole its in. Dominiks aiming for mood rather than overt symbolism The films background often literally out of focus is ripe with disaster and the hollow bromide of ""Hope and Change"" a slogan that means less than nothing to the characters. The conceit borders on the arrogant and often crosses over yet ""Killing Them Softly"" pulls off its reach in the last scene when Cogan (in a speech notably not in Higginss original) lets the mob lawyer know exactly what he thinks the election of a new president means and doesnt mean. As performed by Pitt with gunmetal scorn the scene seems absurd at first (what Cogans suddenly an expert in American history?) yet the final lines slam shut like a prison door on the audiences fingers. By making a film entirely without illusions about the way this country does business -- at the top as at the bottom -- ""Killing Them Softly"" ironically stays true to ""Cogans Trade"" and Higginss cauterizing view of human nature. Let the likes of Steven Spielberg renew our faith in the communal ideals with which we lull ourselves to sleep. This movies the anti-""Lincoln"" and it jeers in your head long after the lights come up. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr.

Melinda Sue Gordon Brad Pitt in a scene from ""Killing Them Softly."" Photo by the Weinstein Co. The biggest heist in history didnt require a gun just a three-page memo from the secretary of the treasury that diverted trillions of taxpayers dollars to his cronies on Wall Street. The scale of the bailout that followed the financial collapse of 2008 was so incomprehensibly huge that the first films that could tackle it were academic documentaries such as ""Inside Job."" But ambitious fiction filmmakers soon followed with the movies ""Margin Call"" and ""Abritrage."" Now the outrage has trickled down to action flicks.""Killing Them Softly"" is based on the George V. Higgins hitman novel ""Cogans Trade"" which was written in 1974 and set in New England; yet the movie is set in post-Katrina New Orleans. With Brad Pitt at the helm the core story about an assassin dispatching the punks who robbed a mob poker parlor is a vivid trip through the lower depths but the political commentary thats riding shotgun is so heavy-handed that it chokes the life out of the movie.The first thing we hear in the hallucinatory prelude is a campaign speech by Barack Obama but the promise of change is belied by the blighted city and the two stumblebums who meet on a street corner to plan a robbery. Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) is a hot-headed heroin addict from Australia. Frankie (Scoot McNairy) is an ex-con from Boston where he did time with Johnny the Squirrel (Vincent Curatola). Squirrel knows the location of a high-stakes poker game where a previous robbery was pinned on an insider named Markie (Ray Liotta) so a second robbery would have a ready-made suspect to take the blame. Despite his misgivings about Russell Squirrel gives the go-ahead for the heist. But the small-time crooks dont realize theyre messing with a big-time corporation whose local liaison (Richard Jenkins) hires hitman Jackie (Pitt) to plug the perps. The notion that vice is controlled by a board of directors goes back at least as far as the 1948 film-noir potboiler ""I Walk Alone"" with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas but here its merely a vague spritz of trendy foam atop a black-coffee crime film. Despite the drone of news reports in every bar that isnt blaring an ironic oldie writer-director Andrew Dominik (""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"") seems more invested in shock-value violence than long-term social criticism. Like the dialogue the retribution scenes are stylized to a fault particularly one where a hapless hoodlum is snuffed in super slow-motion behind a shattering window.At times the film resembles Guy Ritchie flicks such as ""Snatch"" which also starred Pitt. The stars charm has a serpentine edge in bad-guy roles and with James Gandolfini as a henchman whos got marital and alcohol problems the cast is reason enough to see this movie. But like the politicians it tries to pull into the big picture ""Killing Them Softly"" promises more than it delivers.

Higginss 1974 novel Cogans Trade--but focusing again on the talk of hardened men. Pitt plays an enforcer hired to track down and kill two masked hoods who stuck up a mob-protected card game and the lengthy dialogue scenes (featuring Richard Jenkins James Gandolfini Scoot McNairy and Vincent Curatola) take full advantage of the books meticulously rendered goon-speak. The Louisiana locations are appropriately cruddy and the occasional scenes of violence are frightening visceral and beautifully photographed. Dominiks only misstep is setting the story in September 2008 as Bush Obama and McCain react to the financial meltdown on TV and inviting facile comparison to the underground economy. The financial forces working their way through these dive bars and cheap hotels are plenty to chew on. By J.R.

"Killing Them Softly | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; killing-them-softly ) Killing Them Softly (United States 2012) November 29 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Killing Them Softly is 2012s answer to Mean Streets. With a similarly uncompromising gritty aesthetic to early Scorsese Andrew Dominiks adaptation of George V. Higgins Cogans Trade takes a decidedly unglamorous look at the lives of small-time crooks low-level mob functionaries and hit men. Set in the impoverished neighborhoods of a post-Katrina New Orleans blasted by urban blight the movie transpires in 2008 against the backdrop of the Wall Street financial collapse and Barak Obamas election. With a style that depicts every bloody moment of one of the most disturbingly graphic beatings in recent history Dominik (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford) weaves a tale that is compulsively watchable with long passages of dialogue instances of scathing black humor and sequences that are ripe with tension. Many may find the pacing of Killing Them Softly to be too slow for their liking. The films approach is deliberate shifting from one group of characters to another in an unhurried fashion. The focus is on dialogue rather than action. Conversations arent merely laced with profanity; theyre drenched in it. The aforementioned beating is so extreme and graphic that some viewers may be forced to look away. Later however a hit is depicted in an almost balletic fashion carefully choreographed and filmed with almost loving detail. Dominik uses a hand-held camera for many shots but the images are rock solid. No shaking here effectively dispelling the myth that viewer nausea is mandatory for an intimate perspective. Killing Them Softly opens with a robbery masterminded by wiseguy Squirrel (Vincent Curatola). Two amateur thugs Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelshohn) hit a poker game run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) a connected guy with a checkered past. Driver (Richard Jenkins) a spokesperson for the northeastern corporate-types who run the local mob calls in expert hit man Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to sort out the situation and eliminate the miscreants. Jackie determines what needs to be done but is irked because his every move has to be approved by a committee. And when he recruits another assassin Mickey (James Gandolfini) to help with the job the decision proves to be ill-advised. The most unconventional aspect of Killing Them Softly is the banality with which it treats murder-for-hire. This is just another career opportunity for those who live on societys underbelly. Jackie is as cynical as they get - he blasts Obamas rhetoric about unity and change as being empty and pointless. Because of the recession he is forced to accept a discounted fee for his jobs. Police are treated as ineffective and largely irrelevant. The film takes the next step in the demythologizing of mob activities begun with Scorsese and continued with David Chase. The presence of Ray Liotta and James Gandolfini forcefully reminds viewers of Goodfellas and The Sopranos. Brad Pitt who isnt afraid of unglamorous roles has little difficulty donning Jackies skin. Pitts performance makes Jackie an enigma charismatic and charming but callous and deadly. When determining Markies fate Jackie argues against a beating in favor of a straightforward murder. ""Why put him through [the physical suffering]?"" In his view Markie is going to be whacked so why not just do it? He exudes calm and confidence never panicking and never without a Plan B. Effective supporting performances abound. James Gandolfinis Mickey makes Tony Soprano seem like a well-adjusted family man. Mickey is a loathsome character - a one-time top hit man who has lost his edge and is drowning in a whirlpool of alcohol-fueled self-pity. Richard Jenkins epitomizes the ""new mob"" - a direct refutation of how things were done in The Godfather days. Ray Liotta gets a chance not to froth at the mouth and go over the top reminding us if only for this one performance that he can be a capable actor. Scoot McNairy provides a compelling portrait of desperation a criminal who will do almost anything to survive. The audience for Killing Them Softly is likely to be limited. Even some who generally enjoy gangster films may be turned off by this one with its focus on dialogue over action and its harsh style. Watching Killing Them Softly can be an uncomfortable experience. However while such an overdose of nihilism may not be to everyones taste this is an example of how it can be done efficiently and effectively.

BOTTOM LINE A potentially tense and gritty crime flick but writer-director Andrew Dominik turns it into a heavy-handed analogy of the 2008 financial crisis. Bail out on this one. CAST Brad Pitt Scoot McNairy James Gandolfini Ray Liotta LENGTH 137 The makings of a masterpiece are visible in ""Killing Them Softly"" a thriller starring Brad Pitt as Jackie a hit man investigating the robbery of a mob-protected card game. Its Pitts second collaboration with writer-director Andrew Dominik after 2007s ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" one of the finest modern Westerns ever made; its also based on a novel by George V. Higgins whose hard-boiled ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" became a 1972 cult classic starring Robert Mitchum. Whats more its filled with fine performances. Scoot McNairy (""Argo"") as a jumpy stickup man and Ben Mendelsohn (""The Dark Knight Rises"") as his self-sedating partner are terrific; Ray Liotta plays against type as a soft-bellied scapegoat; Pitt is a quietly menacing presence. James Gandolfini may not be stretching as a mobster under stress (whiny wife drinking problem) but hes the films most complicated and compelling figure. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The problem Dominik turns this potentially gritty crime flick into a soggy political metaphor for the 2008 financial crisis. Jackie and his mob liaison Driver (Richard Jenkins) hold amusing discussions about murder as a way to reinspire confidence in the underworld economy (""the public angle"") but the constant background chatter from television sets seems like a cinematically lazy way to make a point. To hammer it home George W. Bush yammers away during a robbery and Barack Obamas campaign promises echo through a destitute neighborhood. This heavy-handedness extends to the overstylized violence and the overused pop songs including the Velvet Undergrounds ""Heroin"" and Johnny Cashs ""The Man Comes Around"" though never the Roberta Flack hit that surely inspired the movies title. ""Killing Them Softly"" ends with an angry speech railing against Obama Thomas Jefferson and the welfare state. It isnt much of a payoff.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Andrew Dominiks previous film the superb revisionist Western The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford he staged the last days of an iconoclastic gangster with a strong feeling for how his story could take root in the American imagination. Dominiks follow-up Killing Them Softly makes that subtext text wondering aloud what makes America America and exploring the greed and avarice that cannot be extricated from the freedom and opportunity thats supposed to make the country great. While it isnt unusual for nasty little genre movies like Dominiks stylish heist thriller to smuggle such themes under the surface Killing Them Softly makes them startlingly explicit. All the criminal mayhem that composes it--an audacious robbery and the bloody retribution that follows--is mere prelude to a thesis statement support for a grim assessment of the country on the eve of the 2008 Presidential election. ""In no other country on Earth is my story even possible"" Barack Obama said in stump speeches from 08 to the present. Dominik sees his vision of American exceptionalism from a glass-half-empty perspective. Just as Obama took advantage of opportunities unique to this country the hoods in Killing Me Softly operating in the looters paradise of New Orleans are keen to find their own angle. In the films most exciting section Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn two low-level crooks who resemble human sewer rats take the assignment to knock off a mobbed-up card game for 100000. Should they get away with it--no small feat given two tables full of glowering men of violence--McNairy and Mendelsohn are hoping the blame falls on the host (Ray Liotta) who was caught robbing one of his own games in the past. Brad Pitt plays an enforcer brought in to find the men responsible and clean up the various messes theyve created. The entire affair unfolds in the period between the 2008 economic collapse (and subsequent Wall Street bailout) and Obamas victory speech in Grant Park and Dominik never misses the chance to note the disconnect between the lofty rhetoric of campaign speeches and the feral dogfight taking place on the ground. It often seems like Dominik is playing against his own strengths The robbery sequence is an instant classic an agonizingly patient white-knuckler in which armed halfwits go swimming with sharks but Killing Them Softly settles into a portentous conversation piece that makes too much of a show of its own significance. Dominik will be damned if hes going to make some run-of-the-mill shoot-em-up and the film certainly isnt that for better or worse. Set in a New Orleans still raw from the federal neglect following Katrina Killing Them Softly emphasizes how far removed the hand of government--whether its Bush selling the bailout or Obamas hope-and-change--is from the way people go about their business. Dominik is careful not to play ideological favorites--he dispenses fodder for people on both ends of the political spectrum--because hes more interested in measuring the distance between the professed ideals of modern-day America and the outlaw past it never fully left behind. For a genre film Killing Them Softly goes to an awfully strange none-too-subtle place but the choice to move the 08 election from background to overlay is unusually bold and thought-provoking too. Dominik knows his way around a breath-stopping suspense setpiece but his ambition to do more is encouraging even when it isnt wholly successful.

"Killing Them Softly Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Brad Pitts Killing Them Softly deals with the financial difficulties of contract killers  Killing Them Softly review Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips reviews Brad Pitts new movie ""Killing Them Softly."" Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips reviews Brad Pitts new movie ""Killing Them Softly."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In an ugly economy murder becomes the last beautiful act. Thats the state of the nation in ""Killing Them Softly"" a harsh and stimulating black comedy set in the recent past starring Brad Pitt as a hit man hired to eliminate in his own inimitable style some underworld thieves in post-Katrina New Orleans.Taking place in 2008 the film comes from the New Zealand-born Australia-bred writer-director Andrew Dominik. He teamed with Pitt five years ago on ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."" Following that difficult but often magnificent elegy which went nowhere in financial terms but already looks like a modern classic Dominik had the devils own time getting his next project together in Hollywood. You can tell. Much of the dialogue in ""Killing Them Softly"" concerns financial difficulties experienced by contract killers as well as the shady characters employing them. At one point conversing in the car where they conduct their meetings Pitts Jackie Cogan tells his overseer played by Richard Jenkins that hed like to bring in a second assassin to help out. Jenkins character replies ""They are not gonna OK anything major here."" Surely this is a line Dominik heard in one studio executives office or another.Theres a mob movie in there somewhere too. Dominik freely adapted the 1974 George V. Higgins novel ""Cogans Trade."" It begins with a nervy idea for a robbery that miraculously works Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola who played Johnny Sack on ""The Sopranos"") enlists a couple of addled punks (Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn) to rob a high-stakes poker game controlled by Markie. Hes played by Ray Liotta whose part may have been curtailed in the editing; the film runs a tight 97 minutes. The stolen money is mob money which means retribution must be exacted. Jackie costumed for maximum 70s cool sub-contracts some of the work to his old pal Mickey (James Gandolfini) an alcohol-soaked has-been with a thing for prostitutes. Much of this is familiar; most everything interesting in ""Killing Them Softly"" couldnt care less about the primary narrative line. This is a talkative picture allowing time and space for comically preoccupied and quirkily pathetic exchanges between all sorts of strays and losers.The title refers to a cliched romantic notion of Jackies approach to his job -- nice and easy exemplified by a key killing depicted by Dominik as a gorgeous slowmotion blur of shattered glass flying bullets and aesthetic perfection. A little of this creamy slaughter goes a long way. Some of the dialogue in ""Killing Them Softly"" bonks you right on the schnozz. The thesis line spoken by Jackie couldnt be more direct in its opinion of a land on the verge of defaulting on everything in sight. ""America"" he says ""is not a country. Its a business."" And Americans arent making what they used to.The atmosphere of fiscal panic is heightened by the way Dominik frames the action against news of the U.S. banks bailout of 08 as well as cable TV snippets of then-presidential campaigner Barack Obamas idealistic stump speeches. (Hardly subtle these recall the way Nixons visage was deployed in the 1968-set ""Shampoo."") Dominik is two directors in one really Hell sit back and content himself with framing simple clean two-person verbal sequences when called for. Hes also skillful in staging violence on the move as in the scene where Liottas bantamweight bigwig is dragged through and then out of his office trailer by extreme force. The picture offers some easy brutal laughs and some harder ones and now and then it finds a way to make the laughter stick in your craw. Jenkins line applies to the film as a whole. ""Killing Them Softly"" isnt anything major. But its a pungent minor film only vaguely resembling the one The Weinstein Co. is advertising and thats fine with me.mjphillipstribune.comKilling Them Softly -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for violence sexual references pervasive language and some drug use)Running time 137Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Killing Them Softly (movie) Entertainment Movies Theft Brad Pitt Barack Obama Ray Liotta 10 movies to see over the holidays Top 50 superhero movies of the last 10 years Killing Them Softly Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1127-killing-them-softly-20121129,0,1855605.column",200,killingthemsoftly31,killingthemsoftly,chicagotribune

By Anthony Lane George V. Higginss characters have plans instead of hopes.   Credit Illustration by Steve Wilson Why havent more movies stolen from George V. Higgins? He died in 1999 but his work remains a trove begging to be raided for linguistic loot. If you want to grade postwar novelists on the strength of their ears alone--how fast they prick up at the crackle and blare of American speech--then Higgins and Elmore Leonard you could argue lead the pack ahead of more distinguished names. The result in Higginss case could not be more perplexing for while we may be cheered by his verbal precision (and some of his books are very funny) the land to which he listens is marked by despair. His characters have plans instead of hopes and most of them come to grief; their talk for all its dirty music is gone with the wind. One film paid suitable tribute ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" (1973) directed by Peter Yates and starring Robert Mitchum. The novel of the same name was Higginss first and its opening sentence delivered the kind of measured slap that older readers would associate with their earliest hit of Hemingway ""Jackie Brown at twenty-six with no expression on his face said that he could get some guns."" (I guess that Quentin Tarantino had the same reaction because his third film though adapted from a Leonard novel was titled ""Jackie Brown."") Mitchum unrushed and steady-eyed was Higginss prose made flesh however laid-back he made you sit up. Since then for anyone dying to hear more Higgins onscreen there has been an inexplicable silence although neither ""The Sopranos"" nor ""The Wire"" might have existed in their garrulous form without his example. Now at last the voice rings clear in ""Killing Them Softly""--written and directed by the New Zealand-born Andrew Dominik and adapted from Higginss third novel the masterly ""Cogans Trade."" Higgins was a lawyer by profession; from 1970 to 1973 he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. When ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" came out Norman Mailer said ""What I cant get over is that so good a first novel was written by the fuzz."" For the most part ""Killing Them Softly"" is fuzz-free partly in line with Higginss devout and Dickensian interest in those who break or bend the law but also because the bad guys seem so keen to police themselves and to correct one anothers mistakes that regular cops are superfluous. Take Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) who runs an illegal gambling setup. A while back it was held up at gunpoint and everybodys winnings were removed. Markie later revealed to general merriment that he himself was behind the heist. Now it happens again which is less amusing. Markie wasnt actually responsible this time but hes going to get whacked anyway because you know even though he says it isnt his fault and even though it truly isnt it is. The perpetrators the second time around are two losers named Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) the latter for some reason an Australian. He is also a junkie so stoned that he brings yellow rubber gloves to the stickup as if he and Frankie were washing dishes on the night shift. Their crime is arranged by Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola) who is looking to supplement the income from his dry-cleaning business. Such is the milieu in which the characters drift not an evil mastermind in sight. The closest thing to a senior figure is a nameless functionary played by Richard Jenkins and the nearest thing to an angel of death is Cogan (Brad Pitt)--""Very few guys know me"" he says--who is hired after the raid on Markies game to sort out the mess. One of the best things in the movie is a conversation between Pitt and Jenkins on a torrential day seated in a nondescript car beneath a bridge. Though ""Killing Them Softly"" was shot in New Orleans rather than Boston where the novel is set it honors Higginss faith in the unglamorous. What is most disconcerting about Dominiks film is his choice of rhythm. We pass from reams of conversation or cantankerous monologue to throes of extreme violence then back to the flood of words--most of them to do with buying selling slaying whoring or doing time. The chief flooder is Mickey (James Gandolfini) who flies in to do a job for Cogan but sinks into a marsh of his own making. If Willy Loman had shifted from sales into contract killing he would have sounded like Mickey. ""What you gonna do? Do the best you can"" he says. This fearsomely primitive view of human functions is filtered through a technique so sophisticated that it verges on the precious. Anyone who saw Dominiks previous film ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (again with Brad Pitt) will remember his fondness for the fetishistic closeup with surrounding details fading into a haze. That blend of exactitude and bleariness returns here in Russells foggy heroin trips in the stately passage of a bullet through a car window in the ballet of crazed glass and blooming blood gouts that ensues and in the fireworks through which Cogan paces astronaut-slow in the penultimate scene. The fireworks are for Barack Obama. The movie is set in 2008 during the climax of the Presidential campaign and the slump in the financial markets. At the start over shots of a derelict lot strewn with trash we hear Obama promising ""the freedom to make of our lives what we will."" The point is clear the sardonic tone is set and Dominik really doesnt need to replay it throughout the movie. During the heist on Markies game for instance we hear George W. Bush talking on TV about the need to restore economic confidence. Ive known subtler juxtapositions. Yet something in the tone of Cogan Markie Mickey and the rest of them does strike home--you feel the juddering impact of low life against the high hopes on which politics and community spirit rely and it leaves you shaking. As one man says summing up both the plot and the mood ""Do me a favor. Dont do me any favors."" I miss the wonderful tics with which Higgins registered word slips on the page (""I been up since quarter five""; ""I took Connie the movies the other night""; ""Somebody asked him if he knew a couple guys""; ""Onna rocks. Olive. Right?"") but his bleakness endures onscreen and when Brad Pitt rounds off the film with the statement ""Americas not a country. Its just a business. Now pay me my fucking money"" you half want to open your mouth and complain. But you dont. You shut up and listen. In the course of ""Rust and Bone"" Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) faces many challenges and tasks. First she works at a marine park in Antibes on the Cote dAzur where she trains killer whales to obey her commands. Second she tries to tame a man named Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) and to appeal to his finer feelings only to bump into the possibility that he may not have any. Alis resume is not a pretty one bouncer boxer bare-knuckle fighter bored security guard. He doesnt as far as we know eat raw polar bear or baby seal but the fact remains that compared with Ali your average orca is a pussycat. Yet this is a love story of a brutish kind. After Stephanie is badly disabled in an accident and shorn of hope it is Ali who offers her salvation. She has shut herself up in dark rooms confined to a wheelchair but hes not having any of it; there is a fabulous passage in which he wheels her down to the beach on a fine morning and goes for a swim before her envious eyes. Anyone else would view that as a cruel taunt but Alis preference for pure physical instinct over compassion is just what Stephanie needs. She asks to join him and he carries her down to the sea like a mermaid. ""Rust and Bone"" might as well be called ""Water and Light""; it glitters and flares with the urge to renew those things--limbs knuckles lovemaking and parental bonds--which are easily fractured and lost. Do we believe the film? The uncovering of tenderness in the heart of a beast is hardly a novel theme and as for the sequence in which Ali crunched to the ground during a fight glances up spots the inspiring figure of Stephanie approaching and rallies to win the bout it would bring a lump to the sinewy throat of Sylvester Stallone. The better the director however the more that melodrama is recast as romantic destiny and Jacques Audiard who won an Oscar nomination for ""A Prophet"" brings such drive to ""Rust and Bone"" that you barely hear the whirrings of contrivance even when in the final reel Alis relationship with his young son Sam (Armand Verdure) reaches its perilous peak. Also only the toughest viewer can withhold sympathy for Cotillard whose proud and pleading gaze would have made her a star in the silent era and whose emotional yield is so unstinting that she seems to be acting a nude scene even when fully clothed. When she is nude baring her altered flesh plus a couple of first-rate tattoos the film is at its strongest salving and dissolving any awkwardness in the reviving comedy of lust. Such is the lesson of ""Rust and Bone"" if the spirit is willing enough all bodies are able.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993. More More (Pres.)

Pitts magnetic appeal cant straighten this thrillers confused moral compass By Rex Reed  11/27/12 740pm Pitt. For a big star Brad Pitt chooses to waste his talent in boneheaded ways that never cease to amaze me. For every single solid carefully written value-packed entry in his oddball career--like Se7en or Moneyball--you get two or three choices only a moron could make. To a growing list of dumbbell duds like Tree of Life Mr. and Mrs. Smith and The Mexican--not to mention his role as Achilles in Troya film that still gives me nightmares--you can now add a filthy pretentious brutally violent and utterly pointless load of rubbish called Killing Them Softly. This cynical nihilistic blood-splattered junk reunites Pitt and Aussie writer-director Andrew Dominik who collaborated on the long-winded western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. I rather liked the independent spirit of that peculiar revisionist footnote to outlaw history but this time nothing works. Mr. Dominik who writes like a sophomoric pothead and directs with a sledgehammer has coughed up the kind of incomprehensible gangster gibberish that is usually rubber-stamped by Britains no-talent Madonna reject Guy Ritchie. But if Killing Them Softly belly flops as noisily as I predict it will Brad Pitt cant blame anyone. He co-produced it. Reverting to his dirty grunge look from Fight Club he plays a crime enforcer called in by the mob to blast the heads off as many unknown actors as possible with a sawed-off shotgun. This action is set against the 2008 Obama-McCain election and the Wall Street meltdown which are used as subtly as a Gatling gun to point out political and socioeconomic metaphors for the criminal direction in which America is heading. Instead of a plot theres an endless stream of tirades about immoral hoodlums and the death of idealism that lampoon American democracy as an antediluvian lost cause. Instead of narrative fluency theres a plague of mob hits each trying to outdo the one before in terms of depravity and carnage. Did I mention that none of it makes one bit of sense? Lets see. Can I get this repellent schlock straight? A brain-dead goon named Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and his creepy crack-addicted Australian pal Russell (Ben Mendelsohn who babbles in an accent nobody can understand) knock over an illegal poker game with masks and guns. Everyone in the mob suspects Markie (Ray Liotta) the thug who runs the game of sponsoring the robbery because hes fleeced criminally sponsored card games in the past. The real villain is a porcine small-time wannabe named ""The Squirrel"" (Sopranos alumnus Vincent Curatola). Big-shot mafia bosses recruit cold sober leather-jacketed Angel of Death Jackie Cogan (Mr. Pitt) to kill off the two ex-cons who stole the money the idiot who hired them and the innocent but immoral card-game manager Markie--the last for mere blood sport--restoring the underworlds cash-flow imbalance just like the Feds who invaded Lehman Brothers. Acting as a grim-jawed link between the petty mob and the super mob is a brainy mob lawyer (Richard Jenkins looking greener than the dead coroner he played on HBOs Six Feet Under) who tries to keep Cogans fees down. Cogan is not above bringing in help to slaughter a few more victims but the hit man he hires (James Gandolfini) is too burned out by booze and prostitutes to be much help. So we are subjected to a series of choreographed balletic massacres including a long nauseating scene in the rain in which more thugs beat Markie to raw liver while his teeth ribs and brains splash all over the asphalt. Mr. Pitt prefers ""killing them softly"" from a distance not up close where they beg and plead for mercy. But the best-laid plans dont always work so he pulls up next to Markies car and blows his head off while Ketty Lester croons the ballad ""Love Letters"" on the car radio. A lot of disgusting bleeding vomiting shooting up with heroin and terrible self-indulgent acting follows with almost no member of the cast surviving to the final credits except Mr. Pitt. Every thug is motivated by money. There isnt one character in the film with a sense of integrity decency or higher purpose and every crime is accompanied by car radios and TV sets following the heated 2008 campaign for a new America of hope and change. The film based on a 1974 book called Cogans Trade that now turns up only in rummage sales is set in South Boston but for some reason known only to the people who sign the checks was filmed in New Orleans. For all the cinematic advantages offered the camera by one of the most photogenic cities in the world all Mr. Dominik chooses to show are ugly alleys freeways at midnight and seedy hotel rooms. For all you see of authentic New Orleans atmosphere the film might as well have been shot in Hackensack N.J. After Mr. Pitt wipes out his final victim Barack Obama appears again to applause with his televised speech about ""We rise and fall as one nation as one people."" And that of course is the morbid joke. The point of this vile cynical and ultimately preposterous film is that America is reeling from spiritual numbness and ethical paralysis and optimism is a game for fools. The underworld crime enforcers final line ""This isnt a country this is America and America is a business. So pay me."" Blackout. Just in time for a Merry Christmas. Anyone up for a snappy game of Russian roulette? Running Time 97 minutes Written by Andrew Dominik (screenplay) and George V.

Hed gobble up expendable rom-com and action roles collect millions and further extend his box-office reign.But the reliable actor is better than that having built a respected career from roles that challenge him yet still play to his strengths. His recent streak of strong performances -- from 2006s somber ""Babel"" to last years fast-pitch ""Moneyball"" -- continues with Andrew Dominiks hard-boiled but overdone ""Killing Them Softly.""The crime drama set in New Orleans marks the second collaboration between Pitt and the talented Dominik; the first was ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" a rewarding slow-mover that hogtied the Old West mythos to the cult of celebrity that clouds contemporary culture.As an actor Pitt -- who also serves as producer on ""Killing"" -- benefits tremendously from the partnership. Playing a mob enforcer rubbing out the wrongs when two fellas rip off card players during an underground game the frequent Oscar nominee shows depth and maturity. Pitts always been a showman but his character Jackie Cogan is an observer witnessing the histrionics of desperate folks unraveled by avarice and their own demons. Once hes finished watching the human tragedy unfold Jackie calmly performs his duty coordinating bullets into heads. However Jackie wants clean bloodshed -- without all that messy pleading. He prefers to ""kill them softly"" so to speak as he explains to his go-between a fussy lawyer (Richard Jenkins).Advertisement Yes Jackies one fascinating character in one darkly humorous and cynical film.As he did with ""Jesse James"" Dominik -- a New Zealand native -- puts America in his cross hairs and hits the target with force. Unfortunately its too much force and his attempt to link the crazy capitalist mindset with that of crazy organized crime thinking is aggressively overplayed. We understand the parallels hes drawing early on yet he relies on too many scenes featuring TV and radio warbling on about the economy melting down and the 2008 Obama-McCain election. That said Dominik makes his point with titanium conviction showing how fat cats assembled around a card game flippantly toy with other peoples money just like the Wall Street suits did as their financial house of cards collapsed. In ""Killing"" its the inane actions of two jumpy guys for hire that trigger the mobs financial nose dive. The slightly smarter Frankie (a dead-on Scoot McNairy) and the drugged-out sleazy Russell (a creepy Ben Mendelsohn) set it in motion and loose-lipped low-level crime guy Markie (Ray Liotta never better) winds up bearing the brunt of the blame. Jackie comes in to readjust the situation tagging his former collaborator Mickey (""The Sopranos"" James Gandolfini) to help with the hits.But Mickeys one hot mess a jealous and paranoid alcoholic. Gandolfini chews up the part exposing Mickeys vicious streak and shattered ego while chugging martinis -- a lethal mix. The scenes between Pitt and Gandolfini are the highlights of ""Killing"" with the two actors pivoting off each other with the ease and precision of gymnasts.Equally on target is Dominiks street-wise script based on a George V. Higgins novel. His screenplay is anchored around real-deal dialogue that rarely feels forced in the way the direction occasionally does.The script like many of ""Killings"" attributes -- the decaying rundown New Orleans atmosphere the brutal violence choreographed with sleek artistry and the characters perfectly selected clothing -- almost makes you overlook its ham-handed moments. Then along comes another political speech and you cant entirely forgive it. ""Killing Them Softly"" really should have sought counsel from its own title and treaded more softly. Then it truly would have hit its mark.Contact Randy Myers at rmyersbayareanewsgroup.com.

Higginss 1974 novel Cogans Trade Andrew Dominiks Killing Them Softly anatomizes a self-policing underground economy of junkies killers and administrators to indict a present-day mainstream world--the world into which the film is being released by Harvey Weinstein heralded by misleadingly generic TV adverts wedged into halftime breaks--by suggesting that the criminal satellite economy and the ""straight"" superstructure are functionally the same. Dominiks last film the woefully under-seen The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford also explored the distinctly American mirroring between outlaw life and ""normal"" business; where that film was so painterly as to almost turn its subject into an abstraction Killing Them Softly leaves no question as to its ""real"" reason for being. Its a movie that shows and then tells tells and tells again its vibrant conjuring of contemporary cynicism felled by Dominiks lack of faith in his audiences ability to connect thematic dots.This hyper-violent crime drama is bookended by excerpts from real speeches given in 2008 by Barack Obama. The films opening credits play over audio from candidate Obamas DNC speech his lofty words about the promise and potential of America contrasted with artfully exaggerated images encapsulating the America of the financial crisis that has backdropped the Obama era. Ex-con Frankie (Scoot McNairy) emerges into a tornado of trash swirling around city streets dominated by burned-out buildings weed-strewn empty lots and side-by-side campaign billboards advertising Obama and John McCain. In the films final scene Obamas words are contested by Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt on killer-cool autopilot) a hit man who strives to be the very definition of ""professional."" He scoffs at the president elects evocation of the American dream declaring ""America isnt a country; its just a business."" The opening establishes the movies romantic aestheticization of wasteland America its ground-level ruin not so much divided as disconnected from both sets of suits on high battling one another for the position of figurehead. The final scene puts the movies thesis into the mouth of a star whose mythic power would threaten to dwarf that of any American president. Who are you going to believe?Other than deliver the punchline Pitt doesnt have a whole lot to do in this movie. Cogan enters half an hour in after baby-faced Frankie and his junkie prison buddy Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) have successfully held up a poker game managed by Markie (Ray Liotta). Cogan is hired by a Mob administrator played by Richard Jenkins to orchestrate the killings necessary to restore confidence in the underground gambling economy. Its a small incestuous town and Cogan tries not to kill anyone he knows face to face (the resemblance of his policy of ""killing them softly from a distance"" to drone warfare is among the films few subtle allusions) so he insists on subcontracting a gunman from New York Mickey (James Gandolfini). But getting the expense approved wont be easy; Jenkinss unnamed character complains theres ""no decision makers"" among his bosses just ""total corporate mentality."" Cogan sighs ""This country is fucked.""Film Details Killing Them Softly RatingR GenreSuspense/Thriller Running Time100 More Info Ive seen Killing Them Softly twice and while it certainly felt like more of a period piece a few days after Obamas re-election than it did back in May at Cannes both times mid-screening I wondered how the movie would play with the sound off. From that opening scene Dominik has little trouble telling his story visually with depth and potency. But his audio choices are to use the technical term absolute shit. As the crooks bop between backroom card games bus depot drop-offs and brutal killings everywhere they go a TV or a radio injects real newscasts and talk radio debates from fall 2008.When not preoccupied with this kind of bell ringing Dominik effectively sketches the pervasively toxic misogyny of this slice of post-history. There is one woman on-screen and she is a hooker treated ostentatiously badly by Gandolfinis gluttonous incompetent contractor. Gandolfini only appears in two scenes but he gives the films best performance as a man drowning in masculine/midlife crisis to the point of self-pitying sentimental mooning over a ""piece of ass"" from his past. Mickeys brand of dick-sick poetry plays against another characters assessment of a lady in his life ""You probably wouldnt want to rape her but all the plumbing works fine."" This talk is strange florid disgusting . . . and really not all that different from the gender stuff dredged up by the just-concluded election cycle. The film reflects a real right-now hatred of women that is not retrograde so much as totally delusional a side effect of a dangerously distorted worldview that itself might be the endgame of the ""total corporate mentality."" The biggest disappointment of Killing Them Softly is that such suggestions about said mentality which add up to more than the sum of their parts are far outnumbered by airless tabulations of criminal/corporate equivalency.

Higginss 1974 crime novel Cogans Trade begins with lowlife hoodlum Frankie (Scoot McNairy) slo-mo walking through a desolate American small town. Trash blows around like tumbleweeds and a senator named Barack Obama declaims on the soundtrack about the land of the frees increasing economic woes. (The film takes place right at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis.) Even Jackie (Brad Pitt) a professional assassin in town to kill Frankie and his partners in crime for knocking over an underground card game is affected by the impending recession. Each kill has to be approved by a clueless midlevel bureaucrat (Richard Jenkins) and Jackies boozing loser of an accomplice Mickey (James Gandolfini) is helping out only for the quick payday. Its the forlorn American experience filtered through a noirish prism. But just in case Killing Them Softlys big statements are unclear Dominik overloads the soundtrack with archival musings of O Dubya and John McCain as well as thuddingly literal music cues like that go-to ditty for easy ironic counterpoint Barrett Strongs ""Money (Thats What I Want)."" The supra-subtext is slathered on so thick that it quashes the performers best efforts to lend genuine tension and emotion to this allegorical tale of a nation on the brink. (Like the plodding heist scene that sets the story in motion the prevailing mood is one of dully monotonous dread.) Only Gandolfini comes off as a character as opposed to an effigy his sad-sack posture and fuck-it-all unprofessionalism truly capturing the tragedy of a working man with a one-way ticket to 99-percenter hell.

Do it straight and it is direct-to-video dross. Put some English on the ball and you are accused of following Tarantinos post-linear narrative forms. Well guess what its been 20 years since ""Reservoir Dogs"" (I know I know) and the refracted lens is the new normal. Andrew Dominik the deliberate Australian filmmaker behind ""Chopper"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"" offers a view of the underworld that bubbles-up from within. A story that tick tocks between formula and formlessness shifting between plot point heavy sequences and diversions into character and weirdness. It is a movie told from within the world lacking outsiders with whom to identify and no baseline for commonplace behavior. Its unnamed unrecognizable exurban setting allows a fantasia on theft vengeance and punishment with some political echoes to lend it some current affairs heft. Its also a humdinger of a cinematic exercise an altogether juicy theater-going experience with numerous stray scenes that all add up somehow to one of the best movies of the year. ""Killing Them Softly"" opens with grubby Scoot McNairy (thats the actors name not the character) emerging from a tunnel in a post-industrial wasteland. The soundtrack tweaks between political stump speeches and dissonant noises the first evidence that this film will be an assault on both your senses and sensibilities. Scoot doing a weirdo New Englander accent not-too-dissimilar from Seth Greens on ""Family Guy"" meets with his burned-out buddy played by Australian Ben Mendelsohn. They are small time grifters but a local thug/dry cleaner (played by Johnny Sack from ""The Sopranos"" but almost unrecognizable as a beta male) has a surefire plan to make some quick dough that absolutely cant go wrong. Well I dont have to tell you that the plan to knock over Ray Liottas back room poker game does go wrong and it sets off a violent chain reaction that ends in bodybags or arrests for most of the cast. ""Killing Them Softly"" isnt a heist picture or a manhunt picture really. It is an opportunity to get some riveting oftentimes hilarious scene work out of some marvelous actors. In addition to those Ive mentioned theres Brad Pitt (who eventually steals the protagonists role from McNairy) as the enforcer Richard Jenkins as the clean palmed mob lawyer and James Gandolfini as a flown-in specialty teams expert. Gandolfini is given ample room to throw his weight around and steal every scene replete with multiple boozed-out monologues that ought to give acting students fertile material for quite some time. Perhaps more excitedly Dominik indulges his camera with some set pieces that may not exactly propel the narrative in any way but they are so fundamentally cool that anyone who rolls their eyes should be in my opinion directed to the theaters exit door. ""Killing Them Softly"" works in tandem with this summers ""Dredd"" to prove that 2012 is the year of the extreme slow motion shot this time with bullets entering (and exiting) glass in altogether delicious ways. Theres also a POV gag from junked-up Mendelsohn that shows him drifting in and out of consciousness that is funny original and bravely relentless. ""Whyd that scene last so long?"" a fuddy duddy audience member might ask. Dont bother answering him - hell never get it. Acting as a spice rub over the entire picture is the 2008 financial crisis and bailout. Talk radio and cable news are sprinkled throughout the film adding a nice flavor that wisely doesnt take too much attention away from the meat of the film. If one wanted to Im sure you could nod off on your couch trying to figure out if Brad Pitt represented Bush or if Richard Jenkins was the banking lobby but I dont think (or at least I certainly dont hope) thats the point. Its an echo of the greater troubled world but the ""corrections"" in this small crime operation have enough resonance for grander implications without calling for the fuss of literal analogies. ""Killing Them Softly"" feels like something new in the crime film because it couldnt care less about getting the viewer acclimated. It isnt loaded with clever twists or any of the hallmarks of hardcore realism but it does have punch. Its a narcotic dream really from someone so rooted in the lifestyle that it just assumes everyone can keep up. To that end feeling a bit out of sorts from time to time is probably a good thing.

Higginss 1974 crime novel Cogans Trade is very fine grimly amusing then shockingly brutal. Its when New Zealandborn director and screenwriter Andrew Dominik veers off course to give us his deep thoughts on the American character that its a head-slapper. The effect is genuinely odd. There we are immersed in New Orleans circa the early seventies and a TV or radio will interrupt the action with the latest from the 2008 presidential campaign and financial meltdownwere thrown from the movie as abruptly as James Bond pushing the button on his ejector seat. That I sympathize with Dominiks cynical view of our professed Jeffersonian ideals and polar-opposite practices only made things worse. Hearing ones own opinions put to foolish use can undermine them faster than the wisest counterargument. Higgins isnt around to protest but Im pretty sure hed have groaned at Dominiks interpolations too. Everything else is so on the money. If youve never read Higgins youve missed the link between the pulp fiction of the fifties and the Pulp Fiction of Quentin Tarantino. Cogans Trade centers on a heist and its bloody aftermath the plot distilled into a series of winding conversationsduets mostlyabout this that and the other thing in which the narrative only gradually comes into focus. The slangy diction is deliberate. (Did Higgins know Pinter?) The tone is morally neutral as befits a man who was for years a crime reporter but you can detect a glimmer of pathos here and there for criminals who are too dim to think through the consequences of their actions and are as a result dispatched with Darwinian logic. Brad Pitt plays the Darwinian dispatcher Jackie Cogan a master enforcer and hit man who does think through others consequences. He is cold but never sadistic. He sees no point in making people suffer needlesslyhence his stated desire to kill them softly. If nothing else prolonging the agony is bad business leading to victims touchy-feely pleading cries for their mothers etc. Cogan arrives in New Orleans at the start of the second actunfortunately in another example of directorial overkill to Johnny Cash rasping The Man Comes Around. (Theres a man goin round takin names and he decides who to free and who to blame ) Earlier Johnny Squirrel Amato (Vincent Curatola Johnny Sack in The Sopranos) had explained to his young accomplices Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Frankies smart-ass junkie friend Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) that they can get away with robbing a lucrative card game because the unnamed criminal overseers would blame the hotshot who runs it Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta). It turns out that Markie had years earlier succeeded in robbing his own gameand then gleefully let it slip to his buddies once the fuss died down. Everywhere you look there is layer upon layer of idiocy. The robbery itself is staged and acted with rivetingly precise imprecision the two young men tugging on stockings through which their features are vaguely visible and ordering the gamblers around with extra unsteady beats. The seasoned men at the card tables obey the thieves commands but with more of a shrug than a whimper. You know theyre gonna kill ya says Liottas Markie handing over the cash. You sure you wanna do this? Clearly he senses that hes a dead man too The fatalism is thicker than the cigar smoke. The scene would be perfect if not for Bush on the TV explaining the financial bailout. By George bankers steal and are reimbursed Best to focus on the actors. You wont recognize McNairy from Argo in which hes the hostage with the mustache the killjoy. As the luckless Frankie his face is open his voice high and strangled his vibe sweet with a touch of hysteria. As his mate Mendelsohn radiates a fascinating blend of smugness and obliviousnessa different animal than his frightening sociopath in Animal Kingdom. Actors live for this kind of tongue-in-cheek prole poetry. Besides Curatola theres another Sopranos boss in the moviean amusingly sloppy effusive James Gandolfini as an out-of-town hit man who knows hes about to go to prison and be dumped by his wife and who drinks in a losing battle to keep despair at bay. Hes another Darwinian casualty a write-off. The best scenes in Killing Them Softlythe showstoppersare the low-key poker-faced exchanges (most in a car against a wasted urban landscape) between Cogan and Richard Jenkins as some sort of mob bureaucrat-middleman. Jenkinss exceedingly plain matter-of-fact deliveryhe could be working at an insurance companyis the most fun kind of satire straight up no winking. (You can almost hear the Coen brothers holding their sides and pounding on their chairs.) Pitt goes the same way. Hes not particularly inventivewith his appraising eyes and a toothpick in his mouth hes like Redford without the edgebut he uses his stardom cannily to kill with softness. Pitt brings off Dominiks final riff on America the Corporation but the film doesnt need it. It doesnt need Obamas hope-and-change speeches or Depression-era standards like Its Only a Paper Moon on the soundtrack following the bloody hits. As in his deadly overrated The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford hes going the extra mile to prove hes not to be dismissed as a genre director. What he proves in Killing Them Softly is that he has talentand that he needs to be protected from his higher impulses. Killing Them Softly Directed by Andrew Dominik. The Weinstein Company. R.

Twitter previousAsk Dr. Popkin On the Bain ImbroglionextThe Largest Law Firm Collapse in United States History Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Starring Brad Pitt Ray Liotta James Gandolfini Director Andrew Dominik Running time 140 Release Opened Nov 30 2012  Editorial Review Morsels amid some cruel gruelBy Ann HornadayFriday November 30 2012As a new entry under the heading What Hath Tarantino Wrought ""Killing Them Softly"" possesses a modicum of swagger and style even as it perpetuates some of the crime genres more tedious cliches from slow-motion savagery to facile cynicism. Anchored by a terrific lead performance from Brad Pitt this alternately bitterly funny and labored gangland parable might have felt bracingly new in an era before Quentin Tarantino and successors like David Chase and Martin McDonagh conferred their profane blessing on the marriage of brutal screen violence and operatic self-aware dialogue. Director Andrew Dominik tries to ratchet up the relevance by larding ""Killing Them Softly"" with references to the 2008 election the financial meltdown and the similarities between Darwinian capitalism and street crime at its most thuggish and unforgiving. But rather than bitingly of-the-moment the allegorical efforts feel strained completely at odds with the air of seedy spontaneity that graces the films most indelible and even delectable moments. More often than not those scenes involve encounters between Pitts Jackie Cogan and an unnamed mob manager played by Richard Jenkins who has enlisted Jackie to help clean up a mess involving two low-level hoods a card game they sought to rob and the need to restore economic order by way of a targeted hit (no bailouts here). Whats interesting about ""Killing Them Softly"" -- which is based on the George V. Higgins novel ""Cogans Trade"" -- isnt the plot itself but the mooks mugs losers and lowlifes who populate it a collection of stumblebums whose stupidity is exceeded only by their knack for self-deception. Dominik who last directed Pitt in the masterful postmodern Western ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" enlivens the otherwise monotonously unsavory cast of characters by enlisting a first-rate ensemble to play them including Ray Liotta in a role that both reprises and subverts his Henry Hill persona from ""Goodfellas"" and James Gandolfini as a hired assassin being sucked down a vortex of food alcohol and hookers. Both men feature in some of the most pitiless scenes of ""Killing Them Softly"" including a cleverly staged chase that ends with a fight of bone-crunching tooth-splitting viciousness. Working with the clammy desolate backdrop of post-Katrina New Orleans Dominik creates a world both familiar and surreally nihilistic as its myriad villains ply a trade thats cartoonishly idiotic when its not pathologically homicidal. The lone voice of unsweet reason in ""Killing Them Softly"" belongs to Jackie a pompadoured philosopher king whom Pitt imbues with equal parts sleaze and sympathy. The tete-a-tetes between Jackie and Jenkinss mid-level executive -- wherein Jenkinss character wearily complains about tightening budgets expense authorizations and upper management -- swing and sing like tiny theater pieces the murders they plot akin to corporate bloodlettings being gamed out in HR. These quietly funny interludes offer sweet relief from the bullets blood and breathtaking misogyny that comprise the rest of ""Killing Them Softly"" in which the violence is no less graphic for being carefully stylized. By the time Pitt delivers the films final aria of pessimism and realpolitik the air of smug despair feels as oppressive as the pulverizing beat-downs that have gone before. Hope and change come in for their share of body blows in ""Killing Them Softly"" but the films own jaundiced amorality ultimately feels just as devoid of meaning or genuine edge.

But it keeps that decades crumbling end-of-the-world look in its near-apocalyptic New Orleans setting and its commitment to serious entertaining American cinema. It also pulls off the clever trick of operating as a gangster movie - these mobsters have missions to complete and people to kill - while at the same time sarkily undermining these same folk attributing to them a heavy dose of incompetence.The story finds fish swimming with sharks. Two penniless young crims Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) shoot up a backroom poker game run by Markie (Ray Liotta). As quick as you can say naive they have a cool calm mob fixer Jackie (Brad Pitt) on their tail who hires an assassin Mickey (James Gandolfini) to do his dirty work; Mickeys handler is a backroom suit Driver (Richard Jenkins).Its all defiantly male and the only woman to open her mouth is a prostitute. But Killing Them Softly is also pleasingly anti-macho in presenting the world of gangsters as a chaotic shit-show forever undermined by human fallibility. The films occasional bursts of violence are tempered by such moments as a character sobbing and vomiting after a beating. Another characters marriage crisis and hard drinking make him criminally impotent.Writer-director Andrew Dominik (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford Chopper) lays it on a little thick both the state-of-the-nation nods with ample TV clips of Barack Obama and George W Bush playing in the background and the idea that this grimy noir is a metaphor for sickness and stupidity in the financial sector. But those niggles aside Killing Them Softly is a cracking piece of storytelling with a restrained balance of laid-back chat and canny visual outbursts - and it has a delicious thread of gallows humour running through it.Dominik plays his hand as a stylist just enough memorably in a scene where a character is trying to talk through a fog of heroin and another in which a man is assassinated in super-slo-mo. Its also a terrific actors movie with everyone on screen putting in some of their best work from Mendelsohns cocky and comic petty slimeball act to Gandolfinis turn as a past-it booze-soaked killer with a sharp tongue. Massively pleasurable and just smart enough.

Los Angeles Times Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The movies poster says it all a pair of shades reflecting the American flag and a gun where the nose and mouth would be. In Killing Them Softly playing today at the Cannes Film Festival and opening in the U.S. September 21 screenwriter-director Andrew Dominik wants you to know that the underworld is our world with the same top-dog-eats-little-dog amorality just expressed with naked ruthlessness. ""This isnt a country this is America. And America is a business."" Its September 2008 at the national intersection of Obama-McCain Campaign and Lehman Brothers Meltdown and the speaker is Jackie Cogan. Incarnated by Brad Pitt as a smart supercool enforcer of gangland and corporate priorities he is the criminal-industrial complexs own Terminator a machine as sleek functional and unerring as his .44. Sometimes he kills guys other times he hires a guy to kill a guy stressing to the prospective hitman (The Sopranos James Gandolfini) that ""In this economy 15 [thousand dollars] sounds pretty good for two days work."" But Cogans not in charge; he takes orders from and haggles over fees with the taciturn lawyer (Richard Jenkins) who represents various Messrs. Big. You could call Cogan the underworld equivalent of a powerful but mid-level Wall Street sharpie or a lobbyist for an oil company doing the dirty work for mysterious master manipulators. (READ Corlisss tribute to Brad Pitt the Best Actor of 2011) Set in South Boston but shot in Louisiana perhaps so Pitt could go home for dinner this updated adaptation of George V. Higgins 1974 crime novel Cogans Trade reunites the star with the Australian director who boosted Pitts indie cred with The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford a critically praised renegade Western that audiences shunned. The new movie has Dominik running for cover in a genre film -- a cautious subpar grafting of the immortal Pulp Fiction -- with art-house pretensions a pallid palette a doctrinaire left-wing take on American mores the application of anachronistic tunes (Ketty Lesters ""Love Letters"" from the 60s Cliff Edwards ""Paper Moon"" from the 30s) to underline murders and way too much faith in the extemporaneous skills of its actors. At times you might swear youre looking at the films outtake reel or a rehearsal video of infertile improvs. Despite enough pummeling to flatten Rocky Balboa in all six movies the only thing that truly rewards your attendance is Pitt in another effortless star performance. Fresh from his 2011 trifecta of The Tree of Life Moneyball and Happy Feet Two he shows again how to elevate a film with skill charisma and no sweat. (READ Brad Pitt on Making The Tree of Life) When a high-stakes card game under mob protection gets raided by two outsiders Cogan is charged with finding and extinguishing the perps. Suspicion falls on the card games manager Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) who was thought to have fleeced his own game once before. But the scams real ""brains"" -- a term to be used loosely in a movie where virtually everyone but Cogan is a depressive alcoholic a brain-addled junkie or an idiot -- is one John ""The Squirrel"" Amato (another Sopranos veteran Vincent Curatola who played Johnny Sack; nice to see him alive again for a while). Calculating that Markie would be fingered for a second heist The Squirrel has engaged the services of two ex-cons Frankie (Scott McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn from Animal Kingdom). It is hardly a SPOILER to note that none of the aforementioned will survive to the closing credits. In charge and at ease with lowlife losers and pricey attorneys Cogan gets the full star treatment when he shuts (does not slam) a car door the whole vehicle quakes and the camera too as if in jellied awe. Hes inside the mob and outside above it telling Frankie ""Very few guys know me""; Angels of Death do not socialize. Cogans life beyond his profession is unexplored; he is his job. And he confesses he doesnt much care for some of the particulars. In their moments before the fatal gunshot Cogan says victims ""get touchy-feely. Emotional not fun lot of fuss. They cry they plead they beg they piss themselves they call for their mothers. Its embarrassing. I like to kill them softly from a distance not close enough for feelings - dont like feelings dont want to think about em."" (LIST The Top 10 Movies of the Millennium This Far) What Killing Them Softly thinks about -- and shows with both relish and ketchup -- is the impact and etiquette of criminal brutality. Cogan finds one of his marks at a stoplight a super slo-mo of the cocked gun the sailing bullet the crimson geysering from the back of the victims head. When another man is shot the top of his skull comes off like a cheap toupee. Markies mauling at the fists of two thugs hired by Cogan is a bloody marvel of sadism and exaggerated sound effects. But wait did we say etiquette? Sure Toward the end of his beating Markie breaks a cardinal crime rule You dont cough up blood chunks on your assailants shoes. That gets him an extra few kicks in the face. In this all-male milieu -- except for a call girl who gets a few lines no woman speaks -- and with Higgins salty purposeful dialogue largely reduced to freakin this and fuggin that reputation is more important than reality. ""Its not what you been doin"" Cogan tells Frankie ""its what guys think you been doin."" What most of them (aside from Cogan) are doing is talking about old crimes. (SEE Best Fashion Moments from the Cannes Film Festival) In one terrific vignette Russell recalls a dognapping caper hed steal expensive pooches and take them to Florida for resale. His accomplice Kenny (the single-named actor Slaine) needs to dispose of their hot car so he puts a lighted rag in the gas tank. No worries done it a million times. The car explodes zooms backward and runs over Kenny -- all in one shot. Its a sight gag whose violence and elegance are worthy of a Chuck Jones Road Runner cartoon or an early episode of South Park (""Oh my God they killed Kenny""). For a guy to commit a crime with a showmans aplomb then get totaled by his own incompetence thats a sour vision of America worth cherishing.

Movies | Inside Movies Cannes Brad Pitt is menacingly good in the scuzzy snazzy underworld movie Killing Them Softly by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Film Images) Killing Them Softly Posted May 22 2012 -- 1129 AM EDT I wasnt nearly as wild as a lot of critics about The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford - I thought it was too long too arty and slow too in love with its moods and images. Yet it was clear that the director the New Zealand-born Australian Andrew Dominik was very gifted. Whenever Brad Pitt appeared as Jesse James the screen vibrated with menace even though Pitt seemed to be doing almost nothing. As good as he had been before (in say Fight Club) I thought that the Jesse James performance was the place where Pitt took the full leap to who he is today - a top-of-his-game Hollywood actor who infuses star aura with complexity. In Killing Them Softly Dominiks first feature since The Assassination of Jesse James Pitt once again plays a quietly powerful sociopath and once again the screen vibrates. The thing about Pitts charismatic badasses - and this is what a lot of haters still miss about him as an actor - is that although they radiate a certain brawny physical fearlessness they draw their strength from Pitts intelligence his quicksilver-cool line readings and aura of awareness. In Killing Them Softly he plays Jackie Cogan a Mob enforcer whos called in to clean up the mess that follows an underworld card-game robbery committed by two real bottom feeders Frankie (Scoot McNairy) whos just desperate and manic enough to know that hes in over his head and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn from Animal Kingdom) a sweaty disheveled British junkie who cant see past his next fix. The two look like they should be easy enough to deal with but first Jackie has to figure out whether Trattman (Ray Liotta) who runs the poker night masterminded the heist of his own game (he had done that once before). Then hes got to smoke out anyone else involved. On paper theres not much to the plot which is taken from the 1974 novel Cogans Game by Boston crime writer George V. Higgins (The Friends of Eddie Coyle). But thats because Dominik wants the encounters to stand out from the story. He wants the drama to be in how these petty lowlifes interact with each other - the chiseling ball-busting back-and-forth scuzziness the comedy of casually obscene aggression thats always dancing on the edge of violence. This of course is Scorsese Land Tarantino Land and also David Chase Land and because those three have in different ways mined this kind of criminal material so brilliantly youve now got to be damn good to enter the authentically bloody and intense movie-underworld arena and really play that game. Dominik is up to the challenge. Killing Them Softly is mostly a loosely frazzled series of dialogues held in bars cars and apartment lairs and a lot of them are mesmerizing. Dominik plugs us into the moment so that were hanging on every word to figure out whos stupid but maybe street smart and whos under whose thumb. The fact that so little is really at stake is a part of the tasty gutter flavor. So is the relentlessness of the violence (Ray Liotta gets the holy living crap beat out of him in a scene that for me was more intense and more true than anything in Drive). Killing Them Softly was shot in a palette of vivid grunge in what appears to be the most anonymous locations in every dirty armpit of Boston and the characters too are walking armpits. They dont rise to the level of being goodfellas - theyre worsefellas. One of the worst and most captivating is James Gandolfini as Mickey an old hitman crony of Jackies who gets called up from Florida to do one of the jobs. Gandolfini trots out his familiar Tony Soprano inflections yet this Mob lug has an even shorter fuse than Tony and Gandolfini makes him a different animal a drunk and a rabid bully who abuses harmless waiters and hookers yet weeps if his wife waves divorce papers at him. When he and Jackie are sitting around chewing over their lives revealing everything and nothing the movie takes wing. Its the poetry of men who have no poetry - who exist from one threat to the next. Killing Them Softly is less successful when it tries to be a tale of capitalisms decline. Dominik has set the film at the end of George W. Bushs second term when the economy was falling apart. He keeps looping in TV clips of Bush and of Obama riding into the home stretch of the presidential campaign in full ""hope and change"" mode. The implication is that the entire system is rigged and that the cutthroats were watching are acting out the greedy rotten desperation of the whole society. But thats an awfully grand - and trendy - indictment to balance on the backs of thieves and murderers who can barely see whats in front of them. (The movie also says that the Mob behaves just like a corporation a point that was made 40 years ago by The Godfather.) Killing Them Softly is a blistering at times hypnotic minor movie that wraps itself in an importance it never earns. But theres no doubt that it has made me an Andrew Dominik believer.     Remember The Celebration? Thomas Vinterbergs tale of a family birthday party gone wrong was one of the few Dogma 95 films to gain any traction but I remember sitting through it and thinking that beneath the harsh light naturalistic sound and smartly manufactured air of shot-on-video chaos what was actually happening in the movie was preposterous. In The Hunt Vinterberg has abandoned the Dogma-isms - but unfortuntely the new movie rings just as false and maybe even more so since it deals with the deadly grave issue of a man falsely accused of child sexual abuse. Hes played by Mads Mikkelsen the very good Danish actor who was James Bonds liver-lipped enemy across the poker table in Casino Royale. In The Hunt Mikkelsen plays a divorced and from what we can see very gentle and decent grade-school educator who is arbitrarily accused by his best friends young daughter of having done bad things to her. The accusation is false (the girl is confused for several reasons including the moment that her brother shows her hard-core pornography on the Internet) but the idea of the movie is that the lie sticks then grows like a virus. It sounds like the kind of thing that happened in America during the child-sex-abuse witch hunts of the 80s. But in The Hunt almost nothing we see is believable. Like the fact that the teacher who presides over the hearings in a veritable one-woman crusade against Mikkelsen breaks legal protocol (by at one point calling his ex-wife to report the accusation) with zero ramifications. Or the fact that no one ever stops to consider that the accuser who changes her story several times might actually be lying. Or that Mikkelsen faced with a horrendous accusation that he is completely innocent of barely even opens his mouth to defend himself (are Scandinavians that verbally reticent?). Or the fact that one of his neighbors expresses the communitys disgust by killing Mikkelsens dog (a case of cross-wired genre cliches since no one would kill the pet of an accused child molester - thats what thugs in thrillers do as warnings). Vinterberg wants to heighten the emotions of persecution - hes trying for a minimalist version of The Crucible - but since he gets the details all wrong the result is like a parable for no-nothings.

TWITTER Andrew Dominiks bloody grimy crime film stars Brad Pitt as a professional enforcer investigating a robbery. A juicy bloody grimy and profane crime drama that amply satisfies as a deep-dish genre piece Killing Them Softly rather insistently also wants to be something more. Writer-director Andrew Dominik whose extraordinary Western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford proved too long and arty for the masses repositions George V. Higgins 1974 Boston mob-world novel as a metaphor for the ills of American capitalism circa 2008 a neatly provocative tact. But he also shamelessly shows off his directorial acumen; unlike the leading character whos all business Dominik makes sure you notice all his moves. Tight absorbing and entertainingly performed by a virtually all-male cast topped by Brad Pitt this Weinstein Co. release should generate solid mid-level business this fall. PHOTOS Cannes 2012 Competition Lineup Features Cosmopolis Moonrise Kingdom Killing Them Softly A lawyer professor and assistant U.S. Attorney who long investigated organized crime in addition to writing 27 novels Higgins knew well of what he wrote. His first novel The Friends of Eddie Coyle was made into a fine film and his third Cogans Trade the basis of this one consists of torrents of exceptionally vivid Beantown wiseguy dialogue with bits of plot tucked almost incidentally into the chatter. Moving the action to decimated post-Katrina New Orleans without a tourist in sight Dominik has done a keen disciplined job of coaxing the plot out of the shadows while retaining the flavor of underclass lingo and attitude. With the background dominated by then-presidential candidate Barack Obamas optimistic speeches stressing the availability of ""the American promise"" to all some bottom-feeding crims plot what looks like a no-risk scheme Old-timer Johnny Amato (Vincent Curatola the great Johnny Sak of The Sopranos) hires unwashed kids Frankie (Scoot McNairy) and Russell (Ben Mendelsohn) to raid the regular card night run by Markie Trattman (Ray Liotta) who once robbed his own game and got away with it. PHOTOS Outtakes from Brad Pitts THR Cover Shoot While allowing these low-enders to emerge in all their miserable glory Dominik also adds his own flourishes right from the outset from striking lateral camera moves to amusingly supplying one of the young hoods a pathetic little dog. Despite their general ineptitude the boys pull off the job but this is bad news for Markie as its going to be assumed hes run the same scam a second time. At least this is what is suspected by the unnamed and unseen corporate mob which has cog-in-the-system ""Driver"" (Richard Jenkins) engage shrewd hit man Jackie Cogan (Pitt) to deal with this disruption of business as usual. Needlessly Markie gets horribly beat up Cogan brings in another hired killer Mickey (James Gandolfini) to help him with a double-killing and plenty more blood gets spilled before order is after a fashion restored. Although the plot bases are dutifully if briefly covered this is a crime story like so many others in which it doesnt really matter if you can follow who everyone is and why awful things are happening to them; its basically a given that everyone on view is guilty of something so you cant feel too badly when they come to grisly ends. PHOTOS Cannes Film Festival Veterans Ready to Return to the Croisette What matter more are style and attitude which Dominik ladles on like sauce on ribs. Russells drug-addled disorientation is represented by multiple distortions of time visual perception and sound; the pursuit of one victim is imaginatively covered entirely from the outside of the building in which the chase is consummated; Cogan arrives on the scene to the accompaniment of Johnny Cashs ""The Man Comes Around""; the just-scraping-by 21st century hoods drive late-60s/early-70s cars like a Riviera and Toronado; and one mans execution is rendered from many angles in a slow-motion explosion of breaking glass and penetrating bullets so elaborate and prolonged that it resembles a self-standing art installation. In a related way some of the dialogue scenes especially a couple of near-monologues superbly delivered by Gandolfini as a booze-guzzling sex-obsessed past-his-prime hit man almost have the feel of brilliant free-standing acting class scenes; they serve the films purposes to be sure but theres a self-consciously showy aspect to them that makes you easily imagine students using them as audition pieces. The film is terribly smart in every respect with neer-a-false note performances and superb craft work from top to bottom but it never lets you forget it from Pitts pithy excoriation of Thomas Jeffersons hypocrisy right down to his ""Crime is the business of America"" final line that is bound to be widely quoted. The film noir crime dramas of the late 1940s and early 1950s were about a palpable unease in the country but this remained a subtext rather than the overt subject of the films. Here Dominik explicitly articulates his intended meanings which have to do with money institutional rot and what happens when you dont keep your economic house in order. Either approach is valid but perhaps in this day and age audiences need their messages to be quick and direct. Killing Them Softly delivers them that way.
