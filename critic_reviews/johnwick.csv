Id call myself a committed Keanu Reeves fan but had only heard of this movie days before when posters for it started popping up on the subway. So all I really knew was that this was a hard-boiled action movie starring Keanu. Sign me up.The film starts slowly and cleanly--Keanu is in mourning for a departed wife who left him a dog to remember her by. A Russian mob bosss upstart son beats him up steals his car and kills the dog. As The Atlantics Sophie Gilbert essayed last week this amounts to the death of Wicks hopefulness and unleashes his retired persona as terrifying mob enforcer. Alfie Allen must die to be sure. And so must everyone trying to protect him.Related Story John Wick An Idiot Killed His Puppy and Now Everyone Must Die John Wick is a movie you should see at midnight with a screaming audience in attendance cheering for every preposterous action beat every out-of-nowhere shriek from embattled mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) and every frustrated request by his consigliore Avi (Dean Winters) that he speak English. Either that or you should see it almost by random happenstance with no preparation for whats about to unfold and marvel that such a strange film made it to the screen. John Wick is no ordinary Hollywood action claptrap but its not exactly aiming for profundity either. It achieves an almost impossible goal--being a basically plotless action/revenge drama but seeming utterly distinct all the same.As ridiculous as it might sound the film that John Wick immediately summoned to mind for me was Stanley Kubricks Eyes Wide Shut. Both take place almost entirely at night in a New York City that barely pretends to be anything like the real place and instead functions as a  backdrop for a grand metaphor to be enacted. Eyes Wide Shut recreated New York on soundstages in London which lent a curiously surreal feel. John Wick shot on location but its New York is a city empty of civilians glimpsed only at night a vast echoing stage for balletic violence to play out on. At one point a character is executed by the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park at night. Central Park is closed at night and itd be crazy to kill someone there and expect not to get caught at any time of the day but John Wick wants to wring the most out of its location reality be damned.For the majority of the film Wick stays in a hotel that seems to be exclusively populated with fellow assassins and pays for everything using a made-up currency of magical gold coins. Yes magical gold coins. Sure Id already clapped and cheered during multiple scenes of Keanu cutting a bloody swathe through mob goons using a curious mix of hand-to-hand combat and headshots but I think it was when I realized John Wick had invented its own currency that I decided I was going to start telling everyone I knew to see this film.LionsgateOther revenge-motivated action movies are very straightforward. In Taken Liam Neesons daughter has been kidnapped and her virtue is being threatened so he must save her. In John Wick yes Keanus dog is dead but theres something more metaphysical at work. Snotty mob heir Iosef (played by the eminently killable Alfie Allen) has violated a deeper moral balance in messing with John Wick and when the higher-ups hear of his transgression they react as if Iosef is already dead. Its like he has unlocked a box labeled ""DO NOT OPEN"" and must deal with the consequences. Wicks wife and dog he explains represented his grip on humanity. Without them he transforms into a ball of lightning tearing through the underworld. Most of the people he kills are trying to get him too but some are just security standing in the way of his eventual target. They get popped in the head just the same.It achieves an almost impossible goal--being a basically plotless action/revenge drama but seeming utterly distinct all the same.Every further breaking of ""the rules"" (never codified but always clear) always results in the same violent re-balancing. Assassin Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) tries to cash in on a huge bounty by attempting to take out Wick at his special hotel which is supposed to be neutral ground. He fights her off and later she is executed by fellow assassins as if she has violated some code of brotherhood. Let me remind you This movie is about people who kill other people for money. The idea that theyd be remotely moralistic is ludicrous. And yet thats the point Even in the darkest universe you have to obey some agreed-on standards or else everything will just go to hell. Iosefs sin is not callous violence its disrespect; same goes for Perkins and eventually Viggo who Wick hunts down to avenge the death of another assassin friend.Im not even sure this attempt at meaning is what will make me (and others) watch John Wick again and again. The coolest thing about it really is the violence. Whether Wick is taking out people at a thudding nightclub a rain-drenched dock or a neon-lit bathhouse everything is presented with a crispness lacking from most lazily cut shaky-cam action movies these days. And theres the refreshing oddball sense of humor down to the world-building and Nyqvists engagingly big performance. The entire ensemble is filled with great ""hey its that guy"" character actors including John Leguizamo Lance Reddick Ian McShane Clarke Peters and Thomas Sadoski in what amount to one-scene performances.The difficulty in anointing any film a cult sensation is that it immediately gives it a whole new burden to bear Audiences going to see John Wick expecting something ironic or skewed might exit disappointed. Its having fun but its still a straight-ahead revenge drama that gets a little bogged down in its own seriousness towards its last act. Its not perfect. But it is special especially for a mid-budget Hollywood action drama and it has stuck firmly in my mind since that late-night screening last Friday. Im going to see it again; the question is just how many of you Im dragging along with me.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Sophie Gilbert Oct 24 2014 Culture Presumably theres a reason why were so fascinated by hitmen in popular culture--possibly something to do with their uncomplicated codes and their brutal efficiency and their roles as godlike arbiters in the eternal gamble of life versus death. There are two archetypes of hitmen according to Telegraph film critic Anne Billson the infallible superheroic dispenser of doom (The Terminator No Country for Old Men Collateral) and the humanized accessible almost lovable killers (Pulp Fiction Road to Perdition The Professional).John Wick played with quiet slow-burning grace by Keanu Reeves in whats being billed as a comeback for the 50-year-old actor is both. At the beginning of the film he seems like any Wall Street banker or startup whiz who has cashed out early to enjoy life with his wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan seen only in flashbacks and blurry iPhone clips). Thats until Helen dies of a serious but unspecified illness leaving Wick all alone in his sleek monochrome mansion as a living breathing sobbing manifestation of Sad Keanu.Related Story Why Keanu Reeves Puts Up With Chinese Censorship In one of the most emotionally manipulative plot devices ever seen on film the doorbell rings and he takes delivery of a puppy a canis ex machina ordered by Helen before she died to give Wick something to love. The bond is instantaneous The adorable dog and the handsome man eat cereal together and snuggle up in bed and drive around in a killer 1969 Mustang--sometimes breaking into what looks like an airport to do doughnuts and handbrake turns in front of gas tankers--and for a fleeting moment it seems like the movie might have the makings of an existential buddy comedy. Only a thug Iosef (Alfie Allen) whos eyed Wicks car in a gas station breaks into his house with a handful of friends late at night beats up Wick steals the car and kills the puppy.This is 2014 in immature animal-worshiping Cute Emergency-retweeting America. You come at a puppy you best not miss its owner whose mystique as one of the most ruthless killers ever to wear Kevlar is quickly established in the following exchange between the owner of a chop shop (John Leguizamo) and Iosefs father Russian crime lord Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist)Viggo I heard you struck my son. May I ask why?Aureilo Because he stole John Wicks car and killed his dog.Viggo Oh.Iosef doesnt just kill John Wicks dog as Wick expresses in possibly the fiercest monologue Reeves has ever delivered He kills his hope and in doing so unleashes the full fury of a now footloose and fancy-free angel of death. John Wick kills by my count 78 people in the movies 93 minutes and he doesnt just kill them he toys with them first like a cat with a mouse delivering a stray bullet in the shoulder or a kick to the kneecap before offing his targets with two shots to the head assassination-style. The movies tagline is ""Dont Set Him Off"" but it really should be ""This Idiot Killed My Puppy and Now Everyone Must Die.""If a movie about a man who kills everyone he sees because his dog dies sounds maybe a trifle flimsy directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski compensate by creating an elaborate and intriguing universe for Wick--one in which the worlds hitmen stay at the same New York City establishment the Continental. (Its a bit like the Yale Club only for professional killers.) Nyqvists Viggo is an old-fashioned DC-type villain who hoards cash and dirt on all the citys notable figures in his safe house inside a church and drinks 18-year-old Glenlivet out of a brandy snifter (in case there were any doubt that hes truly a monster). Wick tracks down Iosef with the help of the Continentals boss (Ian McShane oozing bonhomie and menace in equal parts) and pays for everything with a stash of gold coins recently liberated from underneath the cement in his garage.Its hard to believe John Wick hasnt been killing people with poised abandon for decades.John Wick in fact feels so well-established as a character that its hard to believe this is his debut; that he hasnt been killing people on-screen with poised abandon for decades. Reevess ability to hint at multitudes while his features remain relatively blank hasnt lessened since the Matrix trilogy and although now firmly ensconced in middle age he looks about a decade younger both in appearance and in the way he manipulates his way through a kind of weaponized kung fu. Hes supported by a broad range of brilliant and underused actors including Willem Dafoe as a mysterious friend McShane Nyqvist--apparently channeling a Slavic interpretation of the most interesting man in the world--and The Wire alums Lance Reddick (as a hotel manager with an improbable African accent) and Clarke Peters (as a hitman whos unlucky enough to be in the room next door to Wick).The cinematography (by Jonathan Sela) is bleak and breathtaking at the same time with grey filters dulling Reevess already ashen face and aerial shots offering extended views of the tops of skyscrapers as if the audience too were scanning the city for enemies. Stahelski and Leitch both former stunt men unsurprisingly tackle action sequences with glee (the array of death can be dizzying) but the quieter scenes are more sophisticated incorporating a sense of fantasy and visual splendor that almost makes the wafer-thin plot feel fresh. This is a character who kills out of intuition rather than intellect; who takes lives out of a sense of karmic inevitability after a life is taken from him. Its ethically dubious sure but hitmen have never cared about ethics which is exactly why we love them.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 540pm on Thursday Oct. 23 2014 Thursday Oct. 23 2014 Thursday Oct. 23 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Ever since The Matrix Keanu Reeves has tried to reinvent himself as a full-tilt face-smashing spine-stomping action star who can kick backside as much any rival from Asia. He comes closest to his goal in John Wick a martial-arts and automatic-weapons revenge saga that pales in comparison to the best to which he will be compared -- hello Indonesias The Raid 2 -- but is better than much of what hes done recently. Im looking at you Man of Tai Chi.The story is simple. Reeves is John Wick a retired New Jersey hitman with a reputation so ferocious that -- as its told here -- you didnt hire him to be the bogeyman you hired him to kill the bogeyman. But hes dragged back into the game after his wife dies and the puppy shes given him is brutally killed by a crew of thugs headed up by the son of a local Russian mob boss.They were enraged that Wick wouldnt sell them his vintage Mustang and they broke into his sleek modern home took their anger out on his poor pup -- and much of the house. Of course Wick has to go after all those who have wronged him and of course those Russians are no match for Wicks killin skills.Whats on display here in the debut feature for former stunt man Charles Stahelski is a stylized sense of choreographed cool -- the best scene is a head-splattering shoot-out in an EDM dance club -- as the plot is predictable and plodding.Yet for all the films stylishness and a body count worthy of a small civil war theres no getting around the fact that stiff stoic Reeves -- who is capable of a few funny deadpan lines -- isnt a particularly compelling lead action figure.

Reeves plays a former hit man who revives his career by taking on the Russian mob after his wife dies of a lingering illness. (The gangsters aroused his ire by shooting his dog.) The movies simple plot and bloody action scenes which include more head shots than a casting directors portfolio leave little room for complexity and theres a lack of tension in the cliched setups.

""You workin again?"" he asks mildly. ""No"" Wick replies ""Im just sorting stuff out."" The cop smiles and says ""O.K. John Good night."" Five years ago Wick (Keanu Reeves) was an expert hit man who often worked for the Russian mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). He fell in love with Helen (Bridget Moynahan) got out of the game had a few peaceful years then nursed Helen through the long cancer siege that finally took her life. Her parting gift a beagle named Daisy to keep John company. Then Viggos screw-up son Iosef (Alfie Allen) brought a half-dozen of his henchmen to Wicks house beat him up stole his car and killed the dog. In a few moments Iosefs pals were the dead mess the cop spotted. John Wick is officially unretired. And Keanu Reeves is back as an action star in John Wick. At 50 -- 20 years after Speed made him a top-billed glowering hunk and more than a decade since he played Neo in the Matrix trilogy -- hes not the hot icon he used to be. His last film 47 Ronin was an expensive flop and he recently complained that the major studios dont want him. (""It sucks."") He gets headlines only when strange women pull a Iosef and break into his home as two did on separate occasions last month. But on screen hes still the essence of Zen cool. In 1960 French critic Michel Mourlet famously proclaimed that ""Charlton Heston is an axiom"" meaning that Hestons image and impact transcended the definition of movie performer. In that sense Keanu Reeves is a koan a paradox that confounds all reason. Within the narrow range of emotions he displays -- mad Keanu bad Keanu and of course Sad Keanu -- Reeves does not exactly act; he just is. And in John Wick where he plays a retro Neo in a crime drama with lots of martial arts and gun fu that ""is"" is plenty. Action heroes need only the flimsiest motivation to start killing people. In The Rover Guy Pearce launched a vendetta to get his car back; in Seven Psychopaths gangster Woody Harrelson just wanted to retrieve his beloved Shih Tzu. Wick director Chad Stahelski and producer David Leitch hand their hero the double loss of his car and his dog which is more than enough incentive for him to wipe out about 70 bad guys one at a time across New Jersey and New York City. Hell use a handgun at close range in a Manhattan night club a rifle on a rooftop across from Iosefs Brooklyn hideout. He applies his lethal hands and feet in judo jujitsu the Russian sport called Sambo and in a fine tussle with Viggos most imposing henchman Avi (Dean Winters) a mixture of wrestling and strangling. Stahelski who performed Reeves fight scenes in the Matrix movies and Leitch who stunt-doubled for Brad Pitt in Fight Club and Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith also served as action coordinators on The Hunger Games The Bourne Legacy and Dracula Untold. Now in charge of a whole movie they bring a sleek chic gusto to the six or seven big action scenes shooting the mayhem in longish takes rather than chopping it into short shots. Their work is not exactly edifying but if you can forget the specter of North American gun carnage for a moment you will acknowledge the movies violent artistry even as Viggo admires Wicks. He calls him the Boogeyman not because Wick is the monster from Russian legend but because ""Hes the one you send to kill the f--in Boogeyman."" So whore you gonna call to kill Wick? Viggo has a couple of paid assassins in mind the avuncular sniper Marcus (Willem Dafoe) and -- simply because the filmmakers belatedly realized there were no living woman in Derek Kolstads script -- the karate cutie Perkins (Adrianne Palicki). When they cant finish the job Viggo confronts Wick mano a mano because intimate enemies should really settle things with fists not guns. The problem with this face-off is that Viggo is outmatched. Nyqvist who played the crusading journalist in the Swedish Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy is solid but a little too genial as Wicks looming adversary. Its Alfie who triggered Wicks revenge rage; Viggo is just the gruff dad trying to clean up his grown boys stupid spillages. The movie should have given its main villain a grander malevolence. -- say halfway through Viggo tells Wick ""By the way your wifes cancer? I gave it to her."" (R-rated action films plant diseased thoughts like this in a viewers head.) Quibbles aside John Wick is the smartest display of the implacable but somehow ethical Reeves character since the 2008 Street Kings. It has vividly choreographed fights a suave black suit for its hero to stalk in swank homes and hotels to demolish hoodlums who prove both the banality and the poor marksmanship of evil and a hero with no greater moral purchase on our rooting interest than that hes Keanu Reeves and the bad guys killed his dog. What else does a movie need? If you say complex human beings facing knotty moral dilemmas you have mixed your media. You mean a Broadway play or a high-end cable series. Action movies are about movement and John Wick pursues that goal with remorseless verve. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Maybe thats as it should be No one in this movie is as innocent as that pooch certainly not its owner. John Wick (Keanu Reeves channeling the euphoric whoa of yore) is a recent widower and secret assassin whose final gift from his cancer-stricken wife is snuffed out with a sad little yelp during a brutal home invasion by Russian thugs. Wick recovers in record time then out come the guns the rifles the mysterious gold coins as Game of Thrones hapless Alfie Allen (forever destined to be a picked-upon target) finds himself pursued by a ruthless legendary killing machine that every other character seems wise enough to fear. Lets not go overboard John Wick feels like action manna for its cleanly designed gun-fu sequences--ones you can actually follow--and brutal takedowns. But the revenge plotting is deeply dopey and we shouldnt have to choose one or the other. The films codirectors veteran stunt experts have designed the movie within an eye for impact and theres an elegant sparseness here thats thrilling. Reeves takes residence in some kind of swanky boutique hotel that caters to criminals--its the only bit of wit in Derek Kolstads generic script. John Wick will do for an escape watch with a rabid crowd; dont go in expecting poetry.

"John Wick | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; john-wick ) John Wick (United States 2014) October 24 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli John Wick is a rousing action thriller of the sort rarely encountered in theaters these days. The once popular genre which was headlined by the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger during its heyday has been a dying breed during the past two decades. Occasionally a movie like The Raid (or its bigger better sequel The Raid 2) comes along to satisfy fans with a penchant for R-rated violence but the growing desire for PG-13 action and the emergence of computer generated imaging has rendered old-school brutality obsolete. Then along comes unlikely candidate Keanu Reeves to ignite the flame once again. For those who crave no-holds barred action this may be the best the autumn has to offer. There isnt much of a plot but thats often the case with revenge-based tales. Movies of this sort arent about narrative depth theyre about taking a hero through an increasingly difficult series of bad guys until he comes face-to-face with the Big Boss. In a way its like a video game. It should come as no surprise that John Wick is cross-promoting with Payday 2. There are a lot of cinematic antecedents that could be mentioned in discussing John Wick but this reminded me most strongly of the Mel Gibson version of Payback. Reeves portrays the title character an ex-mob assassin who is brought out of retirement when his car is stolen and his dog is killed by the punk Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen). Iosef is the son of Wicks former boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist). The path to the father-and-son Tarasovs forces Wick to run a gauntlet comprised of old friends associates and enemies played by the likes of Willem Dafoe Adrianne Palicki John Leguizamo and Ian McShane. John Wicks greatest strength is its relentless momentum. The film doesnt have a lot of down time. It offers occasional breaks including some amusing scenes that take place in a hotel where guests arent allowed to ""talk business."" (Breaking that rule it turns out can have serious consequences.) For the most part however John Wick knows what it is and is unapologetic about it. This is a kick-butt action film with no pretensions of being anything else. There is a short dialogue about karma and God but its neither deep nor long. Reeves is in many ways a perfect choice for the lead. When the movie begins Wick is in a deep funk following the death of his wife. His emotions have been shut down and remain thus for most of the film as he goes about his work. Reeves has never displayed much range; his screen presence has always been his strongest asset and its in evidence here. Wick is more of a force of nature than a fully realized character. He has sufficient backstory to make him sympathetic but like Denzel Washingtons The Equalizer his past is murky. The supporting cast is nicely eclectic with Michael Nyqvist providing a villain who is more urbane that the usual frothing-at-the-mouth bad guy and Adrianne Palicki adding a little black widow sex appeal. My biggest gripe (and its not a big one) with John Wicks presentation is the prologue flash-forward which adds nothing to the narrative progression while telling us pretty much how things are going to end. This is always in the back of our minds as were progressing through the movie; its an unnecessary distraction. The film was co-directed by former stuntmen/coordinators David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (DGA rules mandate that Stahelski be given sole official credit). They show a good understanding of how to frame a fight and never resort to the kind of rapid-fire cutting that reduces an action scene into visual confetti. The shoot-outs in John Wick are short and brutal and the few one-on-one battles dont drag on forever. Theres a car chase but its short and sweet. Leitch and Stahelski may not be on the short list to direct the next Jane Austen adaptation but they know their stuff when it comes to action films.

"Keanu Reeves action movie John Wick reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Best Existential Action Movie Since Drive The Best Existential Action Movie Since Drive Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 24 2014 1228 PM John Wick How Sad Keanu got his groove back. By Forrest Wickman Keanu Reeves and the ""worlds cutest puppy"" in John Wick. Courtesy of David Lee/Summit Entertainment Ever since the end of the Matrix trilogy theres been something vaguely morose about Keanu Reeves. The actor has always seemed a little lost--something his best movies have capitalized on--but now theres an aura of melancholy about him one that says ""Whats left to do after saving the world?"" Hes appeared as an emotionless despairing alien (The Day the Earth Stood Still) hes starred in an animated movie about an identity crisis (A Scanner Darkly) and hes even tried self-parody (Thumbsucker). When he tried saving the world again (Constantine) it just wasnt the same. After all this his most iconic role from the past decade remains the one in which he appeared hangdog on a park bench eating a sandwich Im writing of course of Sad Keanu. Forrest Wickman Forrest Wickman is a Slate senior editor. He writes and edits for Slates culture blog Brow Beat. But Keanu fans should take heart because the stylish new shoot em up John Wick begins where that meme left off--Keanus title character is sad and on the street and cant even find a park bench to slouch on--but eventually brings both the actor and his character to where we can believe in them again. Its How Sad Keanu Got His Groove Back. We begin with our hero remembering his better days and a long way from finding meaning again. As at the beginning of every good hit man picture he has gotten out of the game and as at the beginning of many good ""you messed with the wrong man"" pictures his wife is dead. (As we gather from the mostly wordless opening she died of a sudden illness.) Theres no reason for him to go on until he receives an unexpected delivery what my notes describe only as ""worlds cutest puppy."" Before her death Wicks wife quietly arranged to have the beagle delivered after her passing to give the bereaved some hope. Its a slow process and were treated to several tableaux Sad Keanu with beagle allowing her to jump up on the bed. Sad Keanu with beagle eating cornflakes. (Quoth Keanu to the puppy ""Well grab you some kibble later."") Sad Keanu with his 69 Mustang in an airfield doing some very mournful doughnuts. Needless to say this is one soulful grieving hit man and his well of pent-up emotions is finally tapped when the spoiled son of a Russian mob boss comes lusting for the Mustang--and attacks the puppy. (Ill save dog-lovers a trip to another website The dog dies.) From this point the movie becomes essentially a revenge picture in which Wick kills dozens of Russki thugs because they messed with the wrong pooch. You know what kind of movie youre dealing with once you get to the scene in which the mob boss (Michael Nyqvist) calls in his son to explain just how badly hes blown it this time. (Nyqvist best known for the Swedish Dragon Tattoo movies is one of several great character actors in the movie Willem Dafoe John Leguizamo and Ian McShane also make the most of brief appearances.) The kingpins description of the hit man Wick once was has the self-consciously over-the-top tone of a Chuck Norris joke or an ad for Dos Equis ""He wasnt exactly the boogeyman"" the kingpin explains. ""He was the guy you called to kill the boogeyman."" ""I once saw him kill three men with a pencil"" he continues. Advertisement Wick may be skilled with a pencil but he dispatches most of the movies many anonymous goons the old-fashioned way by pumping them full of lead. More specifically he specializes in gun fu the style of close-quarters gunplay popularized by Hong Kong action flicks and furthered in domestic movies like Equilibrium. Above all his almost supernatural skills evoke those of The Matrixs Neo which--combined with his all-black outfits--seems not unintentional. This is not an action movie in the Michael Bay lineage; rather than an escalating series of explosions John Wick offers a slow burn sizzling in a manner true to its heros surname. Some of its self-assured cool comes courtesy of the influence of Jean-Pierre Melville who pioneered the subgenre of the existential hit man movie with Le Samourai and whose Le Cercle Rouge receives an homage in Wick in the form of a nightclub called the Red Circle. As in Le Samourai the criminals here ""live by a certain code"" forming an underground where everything from a call for dry cleaning to a dinner reservation is actually a veiled request for something far more nefarious. (One wonders how they order when they actually need their shirts pressed.) The movies awareness of its own movieness is underlined by lots of shallow focus and anamorphic lens flares and one extended shootout at a neon-lit nightclub--the movies high point--seems straight out of Collateral. Even the subtitles draw attention to themselves popping select words in italics and bright color in a manner reminiscent of the dialogue in pulpy crime comics. (""You stole my car"" Wick reminds them in Russian ""and you killed my dog."") The movie seems to acknowledge its debt to another pop influence video games by intercutting one of its action scenes with shots of a first-person shooter. Top Comment ""My name is John Wick. You killed my puppy. Prepare to die.""  More... -John Roberts Join In That sequence is just one way the movie demonstrates that it knows exactly how smart and how dumb it really is. The laconic screenplay stays away from high-minded dialogue. (The two lines that got the biggest laughs at my showing were both ""Oh."") Instead it relies on visual storytelling as when the killing of Wicks dog is crosscut with flashbacks to the death of his wife to show us Wick sees these events essentially the same way as evidence of an unjust world. Wick learns by the end that the real world doesnt adhere to any code but that doesnt mean he cant seek out hope for himself. With Wick--the best Reeves role in years and the best existential actioner since Drive--Reeves fans have found something that should cheer them up too.

It establishes immediately that Wick (Reeves) has lost the love of his life. As a parting gift she has left him a puppy. Then masked bad guys break into Wicks house beat him up kill the puppy and steal his car.Ah but what the bad guys dont know is that Wick is the worlds most dangerous retired hitman. Only the spoiled son (Alfie Allen) of a powerful Russian gangster (Michael Nyqvist) would be stupid enough to kill his puppy. So of course Wick sets out to get revenge.Distractions are kept to a minimum -- a safe hotel for assassins a hitman friend (Willem Dafoe) a hot hitwoman (Adrianne Palicki) -- and the bullets fly red bursts everywhere.This is perilously close to the plot of the recent ""The Equalizer"" except that film pretended to have loftier ambitions. ""John Wick"" at least doesnt pretend to be anything more than an excuse for a parade of highly choreographed fight scenes ending in mass bloodshed which makes sense since its co-directed by two veteran stuntmen David Leitch and Chad Stahelski.Theres a certain honesty to their approach. They honestly want to bathe you in mindless violence. Theyre betting a lot of people want to take that kind of bath.

Itas a beautiful coffee-table action movie. 399 Shares Share 338 Tweet 54 Share 6 Share Email Print Share Photo David Lee/Summit With any other actor in the role the relentless revenge flick John Wick could have been just another variation on the Neesonian man-with-special-set-of-skills-kills-everybody genre. But with an actor as ethereal and ageless as Keanu Reeves in the lead it becomes something else -- more abstract and mythic. At this point Reeves can do stoic and haunted in his sleep. As John Wick begins hes (stoically hauntedly) mourning the recent loss of his wife to a terrible illness. But then a little dog is delivered to his door one day -- accompanied by a card bearing the same yellow-daisy design as his late wifes coffee mug. It turns out she bought the puppy for him to help him grieve after her death. She was right Having the pitter-patter of an adorable mutt following him around and jumping into his cold empty bed with him does seem to brighten Wicks day -- marginally. (Hes still pretty stoic and haunted.) Thing is the guy has nothing else to do. He lives in this giant sleek ultramodern house and drives a beautiful black 69 Ford Mustang. Most of his time seems to be spent taking care of his dog or angrily doing 360s and gunning his car around a nearby private airfield. Thats how stoic haunted badasses mourn in the movies. Then a group of young stuck-up Russian thugs led by mob princeling Iosef (Alfie Allen) invade Wicks home beat him to within an inch of his life steal his car ... and kill his dog. When Wick wakes up he finds his dogs carcass nestled next to him a trail of blood-soaked doggie footsteps on the floor -- with its dying breaths the poor little creature apparently dragged itself over to die alongside his owner. And people I am telling you ... I dont know if Ive ever wanted somebody in a movie dead as much as I wanted those punks dead at this point in John Wick. This is shameless cinematic manipulation of the first order but the film knows to parcel it out in doses. In The Equalizer the manipulation never stopped; once Denzel Washingtons character got going the villains brutality increased exponentially. John Wick is cleaner It gives us a visceral reason for the bloodshed but then it plays it cool. Its ambitions are aesthetic not moral. Up until this point the film has played coy about who John Wick actually is but now the truth is revealed in a slow anticipatory Chinese-water-torture drip of exposition. Derek Kolstadts screenplay understands that so much of a characters magnetism depends on what happens when heA isnt around so the film has as much fun dancing around the details of Wicks former life as it does in showing us just how exactly he goes about his business. But it turns out that before meeting his wife and retiring Wick was a legendary hit man known as the Boogeyman. ""John wasnt exactly the boogeyman. He was the one you sent to kill the boogeyman"" elaborates his former employer Russian mobster Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) who just so happens to be the father of the same hotheaded ignoramus who killed Wicks dog. A Now the entire underworld is scrambling to prepare for the ultimate killers return and the inevitable bloodletting that will ensue. The hushed terrified tones with which the mobsters discuss Wick ahead of his arrival help prime us for the films action scenes. And those action scenes are something else too. Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski are veteran stunt coordinators so the fighting the shooting the neck-snapping and back-breaking and head-exploding are shot with startling fluidity. But they also appear to have taken a few pages from the heyday of arty action like La Femme Nikita and The Professional films that were built not on anything real but on our collective cinematic dreams of genre. When Wick chases one Russian in the middle of a rave whats onscreen becomes as much about the spiraling patterns on the clubs video screens and the gyrating dancers as it does about the actual pursuit at hand. The fight scenes themselves develop their own dancelike rhythm and grace. None of this is new Filmmakers have been aestheticizing violence for as long as movies have been around and the idea of yet another action flick with hot music and cool images (however hot the music however cool the images) may not strike many as cause for celebration. But John Wick commits to its defiant unreality giving us a fantastical underworld of ritual mythic figures and color-coded spaces. When Wick kills a bunch of goons in his home he calls a professional mob-body-cleanup service led by a guy who looks like the Reaper himself. He pays for everything in gold coins that appear to be the currency of this realm. Theres even a common hotel that all the hit men stay at with its own rules (no business conducted on the premises or you pay a hefty fee) and its own secret spaces such as a basement bar where owner Ian McShane holds court and dispenses wisdom over a martini. Such genre fantasies give the directors plenty of cover. John Wick is a violent violent violent film but its artful splatter is miles away from the brutality of Taken or the gleeful gore of The Equalizer. Its a beautiful coffee-table action movie.

"Review John Wick brings A game to violent business of revenge - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review John Wick brings A game to violent business of revenge John Wick David Lee / Lionsgate Keanu Reeves in ""John Wick."" Keanu Reeves in ""John Wick."" (David Lee / Lionsgate) Robert Abele Review Thanks to Keanu Reeves physicality John Wick is a better movie than most revenge films are As weaponized mayhem of the most disreputably electrifying kind the sleek and eccentric revenge tale ""John Wick"" jabs far above its weight class thanks to the panther physicality of 50-year-old headliner Keanu Reeves and a tightly pitched mix of humor and expertly choreographed hyper-violence from writer Derek Kolstad and first-time director Chad Stahelski. Its a B movie made with A-student love for the relentless thrill of bodies in brutal motion.This taciturn retired hit mans story can be summed up thusly loving wife dead vintage Mustang stolen cute dog killed its time to hit ""start"" on a one-man bloodbath. Sad Keanu meet Bad Keanu. When weary Russian mob kingpin Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) is told his thuggish son (Alfie Allen) provoked this dormant beast he can only meekly deadpan ""Oh."" (Nyqvists winking turn is a highlight.) A kinetic Reeves literally dressed to kill is dialed in to his own particular set of skills here. He executes the movies delirious close-quarters combat sequences -- flips chokeholds knifings and head shots -- like a forgotten man on fire If anyone deserves a Liam Neeson-like tough guy renaissance its this scruffier more charmingly stoic version of the once-awkwardly robotic star. Stahelski who stunt-doubled for Reeves on ""The Matrix"" thoroughly gets action fundamentals elegant framing camera fluidity judicious editing and to keep things aggro a growling rock soundtrack.""John Wick"" is dotted with other pleasures including elegant pulp-urban production design and lip-smacking friend-or-foe character turns from Ian McShane Willem Dafoe Adrianne Palicki (as a gleeful assassin) Dean Winters and Lance Reddick. But center stage its the dazzling fists and firearms of fury where ""John Wick"" sets itself apart. Just remember to hug your dog afterward. ------------""John Wick.""MPAA rating R for strong and bloody violence language brief drug use.Running time 1 hour 36 minutes.

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 24 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 24 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski Written by Derek Kolstad Starring Keanu Reeves Alfie Allen and Michael Nyqvist Classification 14A Country USA Language English New drinking game Drink every time a character in the movie John Wick says the words ""John Wick."" With any luck youll be carried out of consciousness well before the films lean-on-paper 96 minutes run their course.Starring Keanu Reeves as a retired hitman getting back into the game to settle a score - a plot setup that an iPhone could probably auto-complete after the words ""a retired hitman ..."" - John Wick is the most blatant attempt to establish a characters name recognition since the Angelina Jolie actioneer Salt. It feels like every sixth line of dialogue breaking up the string of bloody close-quarters brawls and murky boring shootouts contains or is entirely constituted by the words ""John Wick."" Reeves even says ""Wick John Wick"" like hes copping Bond. Its a surprising show of restraint that the films credits dont come fitted with a knock-off version of the Shaft theme supplied with chorus responses of ""Wick""Yes John Wicks a not-so-complicated man whom no one understands but his woman (Bridget Moynahan). Then that woman dies of cancer leaving our grieving contract killer with nothing but memories of life more ordinary. And an adorable puppy. Then that puppy is killed by Russian gangsters. They also steal John Wicks car a cherry-condition 69 Mustang.Speaking against music-censorship legislation in 1984 infamous kook-rocker Frank Zappa commented that in their severity the proposed laws were the equivalent of ""treating dandruff by decapitation."" The same can be said of John Wicks tack on this-time-its-personal retribution. A dead puppy and stolen car are met with biblical vengeance as Wick tears through New York indiscriminately murdering anyone who is a Slavic criminal or who may unfortunately find themselves standing between a Slavic criminal and John Wick.Wicks target is a sneering heir to a mob empire played by Alfie Allen Game of Throness Theon Greyjoy. Again Allen plays a violently impulsive disappointment to a glowering father (Michael Nyqvist). But then nobody in John Wick is cast against type. Theres Deadwoods Ian McShane as a garrulous hotelier Ozs Dean Winters as Nyqvists sleazeball man-at-hand and The Wires Clarke Peters as a stern and dignified presence amid the shoot-em-up mayhem to single out just a few members of the films packed stable of ""hey its that guy"" C-listers.Then theres Reeves whose spiky middle-parted bangs make him look like an early draft of a character from a Final Fantasy video game and whose characteristically affectless ""duh duh"" delivery make John Wick feel like a gloomier grislier riff on Dude Wheres My Car?Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski distinguished themselves as Hollywood stuntmen and their experience shows. This is a film where every human being is a sack of meat waiting to be tenderized. Not even the wide-eyed puppy dogs are safe.Worse is Derek Kolstads screenplay which touches on every revenge-movie cliche like he cranked it out overnight to net a barely passable D-plus in a night-school screenwriting class. The great revenge movies - the original Death Wish the first Taken movie - work because the stakes are intensely personal. The setup in John Wick just feels like sloppy narrative longhand for someone flipping a switch to turn a reformed killer back into a plain old killer.The film also seriously courts a ludicrous idea that theres a whole not-so-secret subculture of contract killers with their own bars where they trade in their own literal currency. John Wicks particular set of skills barely registers as exceptional let alone thrilling in a world where everyone else is comparably equipped.Leaden preposterous and short on even the wrong kind of laughs theres a new name in plain crummy action cinema Wick.

"John Wick star Keanu Reeves lights the fuse of a new action franchise review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJohn Wick star Keanu Reeves lights the fuse of a new action franchise reviewThey stole his car and killed his puppy and now theyre gonna pay. John Wick is Keanu Reevess best shot at a new film franchise in ages.John Wick as played by Keanu Reeves does not take kindly to people who kill his dogBy Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 23 2014John WickStarring Keanu Reeves Michael Nyqvist Alfie Allen Willem Dafoe John Leguizamo Adrianne Palicki Lance Reddick and Ian McShane. Directed by Chad Stahelski and David Leitch. At GTA theatres. 101 minutes. 14AThey took away his car a classic 1969 Mustang.They killed his dog the worlds cutest puppy.Article Continued BelowWhoa They should have known better than to light John Wicks fuse. Summon the mop-up crew and the body bags.Ladies and gentlemen there you have the entire plot of John Wick Keanu Reevess latest action film and hero his best shot in ages at creating a new franchise. It also features one of the highest body counts hes ever amassed.Reeves plays a hit man so ruthless some people call him ""the Bogeyman"" and others call him the guy who whacks the Bogeyman. ""John is a man of focus"" one admirer says. ""I once saw him kill three men in a bar with a pencil.""Imagine what he could have done with a penActually you dont have to. When Wick gets going still wearing the white T-shirt stained with the blood of his cherished pet beagle Daisy (yes really) he uses anything and everything to dispatch the legion of thugs dumb enough to take him on.And the ones hes targeting for payback are spectacularly stupid. Theyre led by Iosef Tarasov (Game of Thrones Alfie Allen) bratty son of New Yorks Russian crime kingpin Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) who is of two minds about the whole affair. He doesnt like being targeted by Wick but his son really is a nuisance. Iosef made the big mistake of breaking into Wicks home beating him up stealing his Mustang and killing Daisy. The pup was the final gift to Wick from his recently departed wife (Bridget Moynahan) seen in hospital flashback as a fatal illness claims her; she sent Daisy to her hubby so he wouldnt get lonely.Motivation much? Daisy really was a sweet pooch (the Mustang is a close second for affection) and its all Wick needs to come out of retirement and commence a five-borough killing spree.Hes a man of very few words but one of focus as previously noted and also old-school habits. He has a hangdog stare that could do Buster Keaton proud. He uses a sledgehammer to retrieve the firepower he cemented away in his basement. He pays for everything with gold coins as if hes a pirate carrying doubloons.And darned if Reeves doesnt make this character and movie his own aided by co-directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch who have done stunt work for him in past. Stahelski was Reeves stunt double in The Matrix franchise so its a bit like having your doppelganger direct you.Stahelski helped develop and perfect the ""bullet time"" smooth moves of The Matrix and he and Leitch along with cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond bring something of that welcome flow to John Wick where the action scenes are for once more than just a meaningless blur.Of course they cant resist also trying out the favourite tropes of the genre including intense close-ups a rain-soaked finale and what I call the ""metal strut"" a slo-mo walk set to earbanging music.The script by Derek Kolstad will win neither an Oscar nor a Mensa prize but it does have room for entertaining scenes with Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo as mysterious pals of Wicks Adrianne Palicki as a lethal hussy and Ian McShane and Lance Reddick as the most understated of hotel operators in an art deco palace where only the coolest of hit men stay.Coolest of all is Wick whom youd have to zap with a cattle prod just to raise his pulse. When a curious cop asks Wick about all the noise emanating from his house -- a home invasion that goes very very badly for the invaders -- Wick deadpans ""Im just sorting some stuff out.""Indeed he is.

Running time 96 minutes. Rated R (graphic bloody violence profanity drugs). At the Lincoln Square IMAX the Union Square others. Keanu Reeves is now eligible for AARP membership but the fading 50-year-old star (anybody see his 175 million flop ""47 Ronin last Christmas?) is going to have to do better than ""John Wick if he wants to compete with Liam Neeson and Denzel Washington as a senior star of revenge shoot-em-ups. Certainly theres no shortage of spurting blood once his retired hit man sets out to wipe out the Russian mafia in New York City -- after one of their more cretinous young members (Alfie Allen) kills the dog left as a posthumous gift by his wife (Bridget Moynahan) when John declines to sell the punk his beloved 1969 Mustang. As the victims of Johns grief therapy reach into the triple digits you have to agree with his former boss in the Russian mob Viggo (Michael Nyqvist of the Swedish ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") -- who just happens to be the punks dad. He pleads with John ""No more guns No more bullets No such luck. Washington who eliminated the Russian mafia in Boston in the recent and far superior ""The Equalizer at least varied the mayhem with all sorts of novel hand-to-hand combat. Aside from the very occasional stab with a dagger John prefers to shoot people at point-blank range. It gets old fast. Reeves tries scrunching up his face in anguish every now and then but essentially remains the same somnolent performer as in ""The Matrix 15 years ago -- only Derek Kolstad has provided him with a vastly less clever script one that mistakes jokiness for wit. Although it is funny when -- after dispatching a dozen hit men sent to his home by Viggo -- the cop who stops by Johns home in New Jersey to investigate a noise complaint by neighbors merely asks ""You been working again? Ill leave it to you again before John (whose nickname is ""the boogeyman) calmly calls in a corpse-removal service. Keanu Reeves plays a retired hit man whos back on the job to seek revenge for the killing of his precious pooch (inset) in ""John Wick.""Photo David Lee / Lionsgate This also makes no sense in a film that also asks to be taken seriously -- even though John follows his escape from an ambitious assassination attempt by checking into a Manhattan boutique hotel for criminals run by Winston (Ian McShane) where the services include an in-house surgeon. Then again this is the kind of film in which the cops dont even show up when John blows up a vault in a church after dispatching a dozen people. Other actors with paper-thin roles include Willem Dafoe as a criminal friend of Johns who accepts a 3 million commission to rub him out Adrianne Palicki as a lethal bartender Lance Reddick as the hotels campy all-too-accommodating concierge and John Leguizamo as a hot-car specialist. Debuting co-director Chad Stahelski (Reeves stuntman on ""The Matrix) has clearly studied the films of John Woo but the slaughter in ""John Wick"" quickly grows monotonous. He and his star are beating a dead horse or in this case a dead dog.

Sun-Times Media LLC All Rights Reserved. Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Movie Reviews 10/23/2014 0200pm John Wick Stylish action starring Keanu Reeves Sun-Times email By Bruce Ingram/For Sun-Times Media You can break into his house you can steal his car but never never mess with a retired hit mans dog. Thats the takeaway life lesson in the unexpectedly terrific ""John Wick"" a lean spare stylish and grimly methodically ultra-violent extravaganza that provides star Keanu Reeves with a much-needed infusion of cool. And hard-core action fans with combat-centric cinematic expertise on a par with 20lls ""The Raid."" The directorial debut of Chad Stahelski a veteran stunt coordinator and Reeves ""Matrix"" stunt double ""John Wick"" doesnt offer much in the way of a plot. Its a standard-issue revenge thriller basically about a reformed assassin who breaks out his old hit-man kit for personal reasons. But that just means theres not much story to get in the way when Mr. Wick decides to uncork some retribution. Much of it is dispensed with early during a montage in which we witness Wicks beloved wife dying after a long illness. Hes distraught but comforted by his wifes final gift a puppy named Daisy that arrives after her funeral. Unfortunately Wicks classic 69 Boss Mustang (black of course like his hair his suits and very soon his mood) has attracted the attention of Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen of ""Game of Thrones"") the punk son of a Russian crime lord who breaks into his house to steal it -- and does something very very mean to Daisy before leaving. Oh Iosef. Wow. Bad move dude. Making Iosef pay means dodging assassins and taking on the extensive criminal organization of his father Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) but that doesnt worry Wick. In fact ""John Wick"" shows the first sign of its surprising sense of humor by demonstrating that it worries Viggo very much indeed. ""Oh"" is his only reaction when he gets a call informing him who his son has ticked off. Aside from the blood draining from his face. Wick has a legendary reputation it seems. ""Hes the guy you send to kill the boogey man"" says Viggo who knows hes doomed but decides to fight anyway. Stahelski has created an impressively distinctive self-contained world for ""John Wick"" that emphasizes sophistication and stylishness including a high-end hotel (with Ian McShane as proprietor) that caters exclusively to killers for hire. And he runs his characters through it without a single extraneous moment or unnecessary word of dialogue until the somewhat overlong finale. Those are value-added bonuses though compared to what he does best here taking an old-school approach to the films half dozen or so major mayhem-athons. Instead of the fast-cutting shaky-cam mash-ups common today Stahelski employs long elaborately choreographed takes in which every move is clearly delineated -- and credible in the moment. The shaky-cam approach may be necessary with actors who cant stand up to close scrutiny as unstoppable killing machines but 50-year-old Reeves (who performed his own martial arts stunts last year while directing ""Man of Tai Chi"") is more than up to the challenge. He executes Wicks murderous moves with lethal assurance often taking out a dozen or more gangsters at a time with an exotic mix of aikido judo and handgun-to-the-face all delivered with flat-affect implacability thats a perfect match for his persona. There are lots of good reasons to see ""John Wick"" (and to see it on the biggest screen possible) but remember the moral Dont be cruel to animals. Or the ASPCA could be the least of your worries. [s3r star=3.5/4] Lionsgate presents a film directed by Chad Stahelski and written by Derek Kolstad. Running time 101 minutes. Rated R (for strong and bloody violence throughout language and brief drug use). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""John Wick"" transforms the current zeal for hit-man movies into a mix of propulsive homicide and giddy farce. Keanu Reeves plays a retired killer who aimed for a new life with his new wife but whose plans faltered when Mrs. Wick passed away mid-romance. Then her parting gift to John an adorable puppy is the victim of an attack from a savage robbery crew. Unfortunately for the thieves John survives. If the cute canine in ""Marley amp; Me"" died at the beginning of the film instead of the end and his owner grieved with a stockpile of Glocks sniper rifles and machine guns youd have a movie like ""John Wick."" Its odd for Reeves a languid mild-mannered performer to play a roughneck outlaw but Liam Neeson was a gentle fellow before murdering his way to riches in those ""Taken"" thrillers. Preposterous angles like that are exactly what make the movie pleasurable. High-octane lunacy makes it novel. Theres a superlative weirdness about every character. John is onscreen as a sad retiree for a long time before we get the first hints that he was a lethal desperado. Theres nothing gruff about Reeves screen presence. The wonderfully hammy Swedish star Michael Nyqvist (the hero of the original ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") seems far more menacing as a Russian mob boss now running most of New York City. His idiot sons misbehavior brought John out of retirement and if the kid wasnt blood kin you know his father would knock him off as a gift to John. JOHN WICK 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for strong and bloody violence throughout language and brief drug use. More Russians die here than in the Battle of Stalingrad and Reeves performs his high-tempo gun-fu with acrobatic grace. The film was directed by two longtime Hollywood stunt experts who turn a dozen knockout locations into nonstop battlegrounds. The filmmakers have a fine appreciation for their cast bringing in Willem Dafoe as one of Johns old crime companions Adrianne Palicki as a violent vixen and Ian McShane and John Leguizamo as superb crime veterans. The film crew also knows how to make a hard guy utterly tough. Reeves didnt make much box-office impact with his last two action entries ""Man of Tai Chi"" and ""47 Ronin"" but here hes back on track. As John he can take five or six bullets with nothing worse than a bellyache. And he doesnt do much dialogue. When hes torturing information about an adversary out of his partner Wicks prisoner says ""Hell kill me."" John says a simple ""Uh-huh."" End of discussion.

An assassin comes back one more time. Directors David Leitch Chad Stahelski (133). R Violence language. Area theaters. ""Theres no rhyme or reason to this life"" says a fellow assassin to the titular antihero of ""John Wick."" Theyre standing in a graveyard after weve seen John (Keanu Reeves) bleeding from the gut so we can take the guy at his word. The movie does too. In some ways this actioner is a flesh-and-blood version of a first-person-shooter video game. Guy stalks fires gun scores. Guy gets shot gets up to fight again -- even as punchy subtitles tell us what foreign villains are saying. Often its something like ""Level 2 give me your status"" John is a mysterious assassin whose attempt to drop out of ""the life"" ends when his wife dies of a disease. Some Russian thugs steal his beloved 69 Mustang among other bad acts and so John goes after the guys. One of them the vicious Iosef (Alfie Allen) is the son of a local Russian mobster Viggo (Michael Nyqvist). John heads to a ""no bullets allowed"" hotel for assassins to hunt down Iosef but in so doing ends up getting Viggos men enraged. Other assassins including the sexy Perkins (Adrienne Palicki) try to take John down for a price. Some like Johns pal Marcus (Willem Dafoe) go back on their double-cross. John takes it all in stoic stride going room to room to kill foes with a gun a knife a bottle a car a car window his fist and even a bedsheet. As you can tell plot is not the movies strong suit. But stylish set pieces are including one epic blast-a-thon alongside a pool. The movie is directed by two former stunt men David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Theyve pared their filmmaking debut to the bare essentials. That works for a while but then the movie keeps becoming variations on the same kill-or-be-killed moments. Adrianne Palicki plays the lethal Perkins in John Wick. (David Lee/lionsgate) Thats apparently intentional and at least theres a decent actor to lead us through. Reeves detached attitude works and at 50 hes fully out of his ""Whoa dude"" persona and into action Zen master mode. The cartoonish mayhem works in part because the nattily dressed Reeves doesnt play it like tragedy. ""John Wick"" could be the beginning of a franchise for Reeves. Heres hoping any sequels get the character to level 2 with less of a reliance on reloading. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

(AP Photo/Lionsgate David Lee) Photo David Lee / Associated Press John Wick review Reeves gets the action right 1 / 6 Back to Gallery There are some performers you just enjoy watching kick butt. Denzel Washington Liam Neeson Gina Carano -- they each bring an authenticity even a meanness to what they do that puts you in the moment with them. Then theres Keanu Reeves. Mr. ""Matrix"" is right at the top of that meat mountain but with a style all his own. His dancelike precision is almost beautiful as he crushes someones windpipe breaks his elbow and blows his brains out. Reeves skills are on glorious display in ""John Wick"" an expertly made revenge drama in which he goes all headshot on lots and lots of bad guys and its awesome. The story is negligible and sounds like a country song -- his wife done died they stole his truck (car in this case) they even killed the mans dog. Unfortunately for them it turns out hes the biggest bad guy of them all and here comes the boogeyman out of retirement to kill everybody. The films not built on plot twists. But as with ""Book of Life"" or heck ""Romeo and Juliet"" its not where youre going but how you get there. And getting there is fun in ""John Wick."" Derek Kolstads script creates an underworld society with its own rules and currency and finds humor in pithy directness. To lightly paraphrase ""Why did you strike my son?"" ""He stole John Wicks car and killed his dog."" ""Oh."" The cinematography by Jonathan Sela is rich and color soaked. Kudos are due Sela director Chad Stahelski and editor Elisabet Ronalds who eschew extreme close-ups and machine-gun cutting to actually allow the audience to see whats happening in the many lethal encounters. Because if youre in this audience you came to See Keanu Kill. Stahelski and producer David Leitch are longtime stunt kingpins and in their debut at the helm they place the outstanding action dead center (fight coordination credited to Jonathan Eusebio who worked on ""The Wolverine"" and ""Haywire""). There are plenty of ""Oh"" and ""Ouch""-generating stunts. Whether Reeves is executing head shots with mind-blowing accuracy or grappling foes into brutal arm bars his moves are electric. And he looks great in his impeccably tailored suits letting his fists legs and bullets do the talking. He does have a few nice acting moments -- the films rare emotional outbursts are quite effective. There are performers besides Reeves (someone has to play the pre-dead bodies after all) and the supporting cast is a good one. Michael Nyqvist (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"") is the Russian godfather Adrianne Palicki proves that not all assassins are nice and Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy on ""Game of Thrones"") is quite good as the idiot thug who gets the ball rolling but is in danger of being typecast as the guy you cant wait to see die. But as Wick works his way through the flunkies all eyes are on the lead actor. More than a few oohs and aahs will accompany Reeves dynamic dance of death.

Anyone not on board? Okay what if the beagle pup was a posthumous gift from your beloved wife your one opportunity to ""grieve unalone"" for the woman who rescued you from your life as a soulless killer? Now were talking. Bearded Keanu Reeves sets out to resurrect the 80s R-rated action film complete with rip-roaring guitars multicolored lights snappy one-liners and an endless parade of shootable stabbable chokable bad guys. Utterly formulaic but still compelling thanks in part to a fine villain (Michael Nyqvist) clever story touches (a hotel for killers where violence is forbidden) and clear-eyed direction from David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. And Reeves puts on a helluva physical display for a half-century man. When Wick declares that he is indeed back in the game its tempting to hear the actor speaking for himself. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Comments click to enlarge John Wick The IMAX Experience Recommended Video Rated R  101 minutes  2014 Keanu Reeves follows up his underrated Man of Tai Chi with another love letter to Asian action cinema this one displaying the influence of South Korean as well as Hong Kong movies. As in the work of Chan-wook Park and Kim Jee-woon this begins with an elemental revenge premise (a former hit man comes out of retirement to punish the crime family that robbed him blind) then takes off with a succession of outlandish plot twists and violent showdowns. The scenes of hand-to-hand combat are stupendous often playing out in long-take medium shots that allow us to savor the fight choreography and the production design is an eyeful. Veteran stuntman Chad Stahelski is the credited director though the movie looks suspiciously similar to Tai Chi which Reeves directed himself. With Michael Nyqvist John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe.

Well played old friend Keanu Reeves. You knew I had a soft spot for him since our excellent adventure at San Dimas High School back in 1989.For many years thereafter you were my little Buddha. Yet the buzzkill contingent said you were an airhead. Then you morphed into a psychedelic action hero with the ""Matrix"" series. You were the chosen one smarter than Socrates and I was Mr. Bill your sidekick.You disappeared down the rabbit hole for much of the millennium but you emerged as a man of tai chi. You were big in Asia where they claimed you as one of their own. Now youre returning to American theaters as the title character in ""John Wick."" So who exactly is this John Wick? According to the most ruthless Russian gangster in New York (Michael Nyqvist) Wick was the mobs best assassin -- until he fell for some American chick (Bridget Moynihan) and got out of the game.But Mrs. Wick gets sick. A few days after she dies as John is consoling himself with a new puppy the Russian gangsters hot-headed son (Alfie Allen) steals Wicks 69 Mustang -- and takes a baseball bat to the beagle.Ive got to hand it to you theres not a trace of Catholic guilt in your multicultural DNA. You dont bother to explain why Wicks lovely wife married a cut-throat assassin in the first place. And in his maniacal quest to avenge the puppy she gave him he is willing to kill an infinite number of henchmen. I confess I got some mild chuckles out of the fact that much of the mayhem takes place at a crowded disco and at a swank Manhattan hotel that is the apparent clubhouse of the Widowed Hitmen of America (WHOA). Thats where Wick trades gold coins for professional advice from legendary cut-throats such as Marcus (Willem Dafoe) and Mrs. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) both of whom are willing to kill him in exchange for the Russian mobsters 2 million bounty.As you know Ive always joked that there are more movies about hitmen than there are actual hitmen in the world. Yet because Ive always liked you I was snookered into seeing this one even though my conscience said that such movies were poisonous to the world we share. Sorry Keanu but you stole my time and you murdered my brain cells. By the sacred oath of WHOA there will be blood and this time its personal.What ""John Wick""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 140  Content Bloody violence strong language and some drug use Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Those who count themselves among the former should know that the Cutest Beagle EVER gets offed -- off-screen but still -- in the first 20 minutes. Thats not my favorite kind of plot device even as a truly justifiable reason for a movie hero to smoke a bunch of Russian baddies. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But at least director-producer team Chad Stahelski and David Leitch in their feature debut make that dogs death matter His spirit haunts the movie and it gets Reevess former hitman Wick back in the game. If a cretin mobster killed your dog youd put on a dark sexy three-piece suit and wreak revenge too. Reeves is wonderful here a marvel of physicality and stern determination -- he moves with the grace of an old-school swashbuckler. Thats partly because Reeves is just plain awesome and partly because John Wick was made by people who understand action Leitch and Stahelski have been working for years as stuntmen and John Wick features the most beautifully choreographed action sequences Ive seen in an American movie in years. None of that Expendables-style muddy camera work and ADD-sous-chef editing here. Film Details John Wick RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time96 More Info Trailer The violence in John Wick -- often sick as hell and funny too -- is so gorgeously staged that it brings back blissful memories of the John Woo Hong Kong extravaganzas of the 1990s.

Photo Credit TNS advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A retired hit man re-enters the game after someone kills his dog. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE Monotonous and dreary despite some rough stunts and quirky humor. The cast is having way more fun than you will. CAST Keanu Reeves Willem Dafoe Michael Nyqvist LENGTH 136 Keanu Reeves plays the title role in ""John Wick"" the story of a retired hit man dragged back into the underworld. Occasionally clever and surprisingly funny between the long stretches of dreary violence ""John Wick"" is so unclear on its own concept that it thrashes around desperately like one of Wicks unfortunate victims. Imagine a combination of ""Unforgiven"" and ""Men in Black"" and youre getting close. ""John Wick"" sets up a comfortingly familiar scenario. Wicks wife has died of an unnamed illness leaving him Daisy an adorable beagle puppy for companionship. At this vulnerable moment a blinged-out Russian kid named Iosef (Alfie Allen) breaks into Wicks house steals his 1969 Mustang and kicks little Daisy to death. advertisement | advertise on newsday Cue the blind rage and reversion to former horrible self. Iosef turns out to be the son of a major crime boss Viggo (an enjoyable Michael Nyqvist of the ""Dragon Tattoo"" movies) which means two great forces are about to clash. So far so formulaic but right here -- were about 15 minutes in -- ""John Wick"" begins losing its focus. StoryJohn Wick and 4 other John action films For starters watching Wick spring into action is a disappointment. Hes a killing machine but almost always the same way with a pistol at close range. That may be logical but it isnt cinematic The splatter of blood becomes routine and the sound of gunfire grows monotonous. You can almost picture the audio technician tapping the same kapow button scene after scene. Worse director Chad Stahelski suddenly steers the movie into cartoonish semisupernatural territory as Wick enters a parallel world in which gold coins open secret doors and ghoulish undertakers materialize to collect fresh corpses. Wick also checks into the spooky Continental Hotel a safe haven where violent business is not allowed -- a notion screenwriter Derek Kolstad surely spotted in Reeves 2005 film ""Constantine."" Willem Dafoe Adrianne Palicki and Clarke Peters play Wicks friends and potential enemies. Despite some impressively rough stunts and moments of offbeat humor (Nyqvist provides most of them) ""John Wick"" ends up feeling like a slow march toward an anticlimax. Youll be amazed its not three hours long.

(Lionsgate) By Stephanie Merry October 23 2014 Follow stephmerry Keanu Reeves just hit the big 5-0 but he can still tussle with the best of them. And he needs to in the title role of ""John Wick"" an action flick in overdrive. The movie is what youd expect from two stunt- choreographers-turned-directors (David Leitch and Chad Stahelski) with the addition of a few fun flourishes. As the movie begins Wicks wife has just died after a long illness. Wick is despondent and the cinematography is cold and gray as if the scenes have been shot through a stainless-steel filter. But things warm up considerably with the introduction of a lively new character a beagle puppy. The unbearably adorable Daisy is a posthumous gift from Wicks beloved and with every puppy kiss and tail wag this seems like it might be the most heart-melting action movie ever -- until Daisy meets an untimely end. It comes at the hands of Russian hooligans who break into Wicks house because they want to steal his 1969 Mustang then mercilessly beat him as well as the pup. What these young thugs dont realize is that Wick is a retired hit man with a frightening reputation. Even his old boss calls him the Bogeyman because when you need to off the Bogeyman you call John Wick. The killing machines former employer Russian mafioso Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) happens to be the father of the puppy-murdering ringleader (Alfie Allen from ""Game of Thrones"" again playing the idiot son). Naturally Wick plans to take the kid out while Viggo tries to stop the inevitable retaliation. Action abounds of course and Leitch and Stahelski capture it well opting for wider shots rather than the kinetic confusing quick cutting thats in fashion. At one point Wick sneaks into a club where his nemesis is hiding and the fighting is choreographed first to a slow soulful tune and then to a faster beat. Both sequences unfold flawlessly and Wick looks oh-so-cool as he plays Whac-A-Mole with the Russian mobsters. But there are pitfalls to filming this way Its easier to see the puppet strings. Some of the hand-to-hand combat has obviously been sped up during the editing process and the result looks distractingly fake. The story especially toward the end is a lot less important than those fight sequences. But early on smart funny scenes attempt to answer questions other action movies dont address. For example How do our invincible heroes navigate car chases so ably? In this case we see John Wick practicing his skills amid obstacles in a parking lot. And what happens to all those dead bodies? Here theres a jaunty cleanup crew. Reeves with shaggy hair and a three-piece suit plays the quiet assassin well plus its easy to root for a grieving husband (and maybe even easier to appreciate a puppy avenger). Nyqvist is less subtle. Hes positively Putinesque -- tiny virile maniacal -- with his Russian accent and crazy eyes. When hes not yelling or punching people he sits by his fireplace singing Russian folk songs. Like so many action movies ""John Wick"" goes way beyond a reasonable carnage threshold. Brawls that are exciting in the beginning become dull as each sequence attempts to outdo the last. But John Wick has a more interesting story and better fights than most not to mention if too briefly a puppy.   1/2 R. At area theaters.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 344 p.m. MST October 23 2014Keanu Reeves plays a retired hit man who is drawn back into business over a dead dog. As silly as that sounds the film with terrific action scenes works.Keanu Reeves is out for revenge in ""John Wick.""(Photo Lionsgate)Story HighlightsCritics review 3.5 starsThe story is absurd hinging on a dead dog.The action however is superb.Reeves is a good fit perfect for the role of a retired hit man seeking revenge.""John Wick"" is like the action-movie version of a shark -- a non-stop killing machine that dies if it ever stops moving.Luckily for the most part it does not. Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski see to that.The film also finds Keanu Reeves doing what he does best being the stoic action star who says little but does much. Reeves gets a bad rap as an actor but he is compulsively watchable. If you have any doubt ""John Wick"" should prove otherwise.On the other hand its a good thing he is so watchable because the script by Derek Kolstad is about five kinds of stupid. Not that it matters much. This is an action movie thats not afraid of the description. Reeves is surrounded by a talented cast including Willem Dafoe Ian McShane and Adrianne Palicki.But truly the film barely needs dialogue. Youd have no trouble making sense of it with the sound off. The directors make the video-game vibe explicit at one point which befits the heightened reality. Lots and lots of people get shot or stabbed or strangled (or all three) but theres a reason. And that is a dead dog.Wick we learn in flashbacks has just lost his wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) to disease. Hes devastated but her last act was to have a dog delivered to him so that he would have something to love and take care of.Related azcentral.coms newest movie reviews | Fall movie guideWhile Wick is getting gas for his Mustang a man (Alfie Allen) offers him money for the car. Wick declines; later that night the man and his thugs break into Wicks house beat him with a bat steal the car and yes kill the dog.Mistake. Big mistake.The man turns out to be the son of Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) a crime lord who knows that Wicks past isnt all walks along the beach with his wife. He is in fact a retired hit man who used to work with Viggo. Is he the bogeyman Viggos son sneers? No Viggo explains. Hes the man you send when you want to kill the bogeyman. (There is a bizarre darkly funny scene in which Viggo sings what sounds like a little Russian ditty about the bogeyman.)Viggo tries to talk Wick into not coming after his son but he knows better. What follows is Wick fighting against an army of Viggos assassins. Its not a fair fight. What makes it so entertaining is the way Leitch and Stahelski shoot the action scenes. Theyre brutally violent to be sure but theyre also like Wick whos also like Reeves straightforward no frills chilling in their economy (of story not of ammunition).More 5 essential Keanu Reeves filmsThey dont live in a comic-book world but its not reality either. Its like a land of gangsters. The coolest touch is a hotel run by McShanes Winston that services criminals exclusively with the understanding that no business of the violent kind is to be conducted there. They may be killers but they do have a code and breaking it is not advisable.Theres something refreshing about a movie that knows what it is and what it wants to be. ""John Wick"" is that kind of movie. Its a revenge fantasy with honor among thieves (and killers) an adrenaline rush that never lets up. It doesnt aim particularly high but as long as the action keeps coming it hits its target.AZCENTRALJohn Wick (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsJohn Wick3.5 starsDirectors David Leitch Chad Stahelski.Cast Keanu Reeves Michael Nyqvist Alfie Allen.Rating R for strong and bloody violence throughout language and brief drug use.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. twitter.com/goodyk.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1tO9DU0 More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""What happened John? We were professionals civilized"" grumbles a Russian mobster toward the end of John Wick an underworld fantasy that grafts crisp action on to Rian Johnson-esque world-building producing one of the more fully realized shoot-em-up flicks in recent memory. Co-directed by veteran stuntmen David Leitch and Chad Stahelski Wick reconfigures the badass laconic cool of crime and action movies past to create a colorful remarkably self-contained vision of a world made of dominos falling into disorder. Viewers take it for granted that most action movies unfold in a parallel reality of shoot-outs and fiery car chases but Wicks script--by Derek Kolstad who wrote the solid no-frills direct-to-video The Package--distinguishes itself by carefully defining the boundaries of its universe in which criminals have their own currency (gold bullion naturally) and Manhattan is home to boutique hotels that cater exclusively to hitmen. This is an underground culture of members-only nightclubs and service entrances with no morals but plenty of rules a bit like the Wayfarer-wearing bloodsucker societies of vampire fiction. ""Nothing personal; its strictly business"" goes the old crime movie cliche which Wick pushes to the edge of absurdity. Here the eponymous ex-hitman (Keanu Reeves perfectly cast as a blank slate) sets out to take down a whole crime syndicate because the big boss bratty son killed his dog--a violation of the terms of Wicks exit deal. The cast is thick with ringers--Willem Dafoe Ian McShane John Leguizamo Lance Reddick Clarke Peters--who look good in tailored suits and trench coats; each puts his own memorable spin on the archetype of the natty professional crook. Unsurprisingly Jean-Pierre Melville is invoked through the name of the nightclub that provides the backdrop for one of the movies major set-pieces The Red Circle. (Another important referent the clean white linework of Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza Vieira subject of a book Wick owns.) Its all completely artificial and deliberately vague full of tactful coded lingo (""reservations"" for body disposal for instance) and comic juxtapositions of the violent and the urbane like the zippered garment bag in which Wick transports his bulletproof vest. Leitch and Stahelskis staging of the movies action scenes converts this abstract cool into kinetic energy combining point-blank gunfire with acrobatic dodges rolls and jabs. Like Reeves own directorial debut the martial arts flick Man Of Tai Chi Wick is in part a showcase for practical stunt work albeit one made with a bit more flash. Silhouettes--a cop seen through a door a goon through opaque glass--are a motif transforming characters into backlit shapes. Michael Manns Collateral comes to mind especially during the Red Circle sequence though Leitch and Stahelski favor a less impressionistic style using clean wide compositions and pivoting camera movements to emphasize the finesse of their performers. Their use of Kaleidas sparse slinky ""Think""--one of the most effective and eccentric sound track choices in a recent action movie--underscores the sense that what the viewer is watching is essentially a very loud and bloody dance piece.

That pretty much sums up my feelings about Keanu Reeves career as an action star. For every gem like Speed or The Matrix there are about a dozen dead-on-arrival duds. I stopped counting somewhere around Constantine. But his latest rock-em sock-em mission of mayhem John Wick is not only a return to badass form for the actor its also one of the most excitingly visceral action flicks Ive seen in ages. The movies setup is almost comical in its simplicity. Reeves plays the hero of the title a legendarily unkillable (almost Keyser Soze-like) hitman who retired from the profession five years earlier when he fell in love. But his wife has just passed away and some hot-headed Russian gangster (Game of Thrones Alfie Allen) has foolishly interrupted his grieving by stealing his 1969 Ford Mustang beating the snot out of him and killing his dog. And you just dont mess with a mans dog. John Wick is back in business. Decked out in a natty black three-piece suit and a scruffy beard Wick is a classic man of few words. Hes Clint Eastwood minus the cheroot and the spaghetti. Id be surprised if he speaks more than a dozen lines in the film. But when he opens his mouth you can be damn sure he means what he says. His is the language of high-caliber bursts of lead and acrobatic fists-of-fury beat-downs. Things get complicated on Wicks path to payback because it turns out the Russian thug who wronged him is the son of the crime boss (Michael Nyqvist of the original Swedish Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and its sequels) he once worked for. Who are we kidding? That wont prevent an orgy of bullet-riddled vengeance. Confidently directed by veteran stuntman Chad Stahelski John Wick has a pulsating daredevil energy. And the screenplay by Derek Kolstad (2012s The Package) is a marvelously rich and stylish feat of pulpy world-building. Wick and his fellow hitmen (including Willem Dafoe Ian McShane and Adrianne Palicki) are like medieval masons who live by an arcane code of bylaws; they even have their own swank safe house reserved for members of their trade. John Wick could have easily been another disposable Hollywood knuckle-dragger. But you get the sense that the filmmakers -- and their revitalized leading man -- were aiming for something a little daffier smarter and more elusive. Theyve taken a broken clock and lovingly restored it with Swiss timing and precision.

Keanu Reeves is the title character a retired assassin inspired to resume his career after yes armed thugs kill his dog thereby unleashing hell in the form of a fearsomely competent man with nothing to lose. Directed by stunt veteran (and Reeves collaborator) Chad Stahelski ""John Wick"" hearkens back to a past and perhaps forgotten style of American action filmmaking. The shots are long with the actors clearly doing as much of the fighting as they can and the scenes of hand-to-hand combat and shooting battles constructed in large pieces that resemble choreography rather than in a collage of quick-cut footage. This isnt champagne filmmaking but its a strong and hearty microbrew with flavor style and craft in every drop. See video Keanu Reeves Loses Temper Over Dead Dog in John Wick Trailer (Video) Reeves and Stahelski (who has also served as the actors stunt double) obviously know the tone theyre going for. We see Johns marriage to his late wife (Bridget Moynahan) in flashback and we know it was a happy time because its the only set of scenes in the film with brown in them -- everything else is either wet-tarmac black gun-metal blue or nightclub-neon red. Of course before her tragic death from an unnamed medical issue Mrs. Wick arranged for John to get a puppy so that he might have something anything to love. But when greedy gangsters kid Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen as dislikable here as he is on ""Game of Thrones"") takes a liking to Wicks wicked Mustang that hes told is not for sale thugs beat up Wick kill the dog and take the car. Bad call. Iosef is of course the son of local kingpin Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) who turns his resources to keeping his son safe from Wick but it takes more than hired muscle to stop our hero. Theres a great line John Wayne has in 1976s ""The Shootist"" where his gunslinger character explains his deadly reputation ""Sometimes it isnt being fast that counts or even accurate but willing. Most men will draw a breath or blink an eye before they shoot. I wont."" And thats how Reeves plays Wick in action -- no hesitation no doubt. And Reeves also fights impressively with a mix of MMA moves and wrestling-style takedowns and reversals so he can get enough of an upper hand to then shoot his opponent. Also read Ouija Board Predicts Box Office Teen Thriller to Beat Brad Pitt Keanu Reeves Bill Murray A friction-free fantasy of firearms and fistfights more inspired by the best of John Woo than any modern American so-called action film ""John Wick"" (featuring a screenplay by Derek Kolstad) also creates a bizarre stylized version of New York with criminal activity and community in every darkened corner and no square citizens in sight. A hotel The Continental functions as a neutral zone for criminals; body-disposal men in argyle sweaters show up when called; a nightclub cheekily called ""Red Circle"" allows various killers and crime lords a safe place to socialize. As for Reeves its safe to bet that he knows his motivation here isnt to be taken entirely seriously but the actor plays it straight as a gentleman killer -- someone with a code. The supporting cast -- Allen Nyqvist Willem Dafoe as another assassin Adrianne Palicki as the lethal Ms. Perkins Dean Winters as a minion with a language barrier and Lance Riddick as The Continentals cool courtly desk man -- each wring plenty of juice from the pulp of the script and the films demi-monde. See photos 13 of Keanu Reeves Most Insane Movie Premises - From John Wick to Johnny Mnemonic (Photos) There are a few minor off notes in ""John Wick"" most notably the screechy instantly-dated song selections on the soundtrack but Reeves is more than easy to watch as our anti-hero. He cuts a fine figure in his three-piece suits -- four-piece if you count the bulletproof vest under the tailored one -- and eventually the film plays as armed Faulkner The past isnt dead and it isnt even past but you can perhaps shoot it in the face and make it go away. Stahelski and producer (and were it not for the DGA co-director) David Leitch have crafted a satisfying low-budget high-functioning action film with credit also due to stunt coordinator and second-unit director Darrin Prescott.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 744 p.m. EDT October 24 2014Keanu Reeves spends most of ""John Wick"" in blood-spattered suits.(Photo David Lee Lionsgate via AP)About 90 minutes into the non-stop bloodbath that is John Wick a Russian mobster begs the vengeful title character ""No more guns No more bullets""Its a plea that any sentient being watching the film might have made about an hour earlier. ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opening Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwide).The body count is close to 100. A snively thug the son of a powerful Russian mobster steals Wicks precious 1969 Mustang and kills his beagle puppy. Vengeance must be Wicks even if it means extensive collateral damage.USA TODAYKeanu Reeves seeks a killer return with John WickJohn Wick adds little to the revenge thriller genre save for a few stylish shots. The first couple times we see a clever camera angle its mildly impressive. When the same shot is repeated monotonously throughout the film its one of many irritating aspects of this stupefyingly violent film.Keanu Reeves plays Wick a man of few words and many weapons. When we first meet him hes in mourning for his wife (Bridget Moynahan) who died of an unspecified illness.USA TODAYJohn Wick beagle is cutest dog in the worldUpon returning home from her funeral he receives a package. His late wife arranged to have an adorable puppy delivered to her husband posthumously to keep him company and bring him happiness again.Its a lovely thoughtful gesture -- the first and last such moment in an overbearingly grim and tedious action film.Every dog lover will be shaken by the brutal slaying of the innocent pup. Yet it says something about the prevalence of movie violence that the many vicious murders of humans grow numbing. Conveniently Wick is a former hit man for the Russian Mob. When he wasnt killing a trio of men with a pencil he found time to become fluent in Russian. But dont be fooled by Wicks linguistic flourishes. He falls into Bill and Teds patois soon enough.Keanu Reeves stars in the title role as a retired hit man out for revenge in John Wick. (Photo David Lee Lionsgate via AP)Though Wick apparently retired when he found love and domesticity he kept a stash of automatic weapons and other killing implements under his basement floor -- because you just never know when an underworld creep like Iosef (Alfie Allen) might invade your home steal your ride and kill your dog. Like a twisted Boy Scout Wick is prepared.Director Chad Stahelski was the stuntman who replaced Brandon Lee in 1994s The Crow. Here he assembles a strong cast then bathes them all in blood. A better script might have counter-balanced the incessant gore.The ever-nimble Reeves spends much of his time in blood-spattered stylish suits. He checks into a ritzy Manhattan hotel a mecca for mobsters and goes on a ruthless slaughterfest killing his way through a barrage of gangland sleazebags to get to Iosef. Most are shot often repeatedly and at point-blank range. Some are stabbed viciously or beaten to a pulp. The movie becomes a blur of spurting blood and thudding bodies.Flashes of twisted humor do arise. The elite gangland hotel offers a couple of wryly amusing moments. Most who checked in could never leave thanks to Wick. Also funny is the reaction of a police officer who responds to noise complaints at Wicks house. A blood-speckled Wick answers the door with a visible dead body behind him. The cop politely responds ""Ill let you get back to it.""And after a dozen dead guys make a bloody mess in his stunning modern manse Wick phones a company that promptly disposes of corpses and cleans up scattered entrails.John Wick serves up a noxious clashing blend of hyper-realistic and cartoonish violence.

John Wick (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review John Wick (R) Keanu Reeves is the only good thing in this generic shoot-em-up. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/22/2014 Editor rating 2 Where have you gone Keanu Reeves? With the exception of two movies released late last year that no one saw (47 Ronin and Man of Tai Chi his directorial debut) Reeves hasnt starred in a film since 2008s The Day the Earth Stood Still. Watching Reeves punch and kick and shoot his way through John Wick a generic but well-crafted shoot-em-up youre reminded what a great action star he is -- balletic graceful athletic and always in the moment. Unlike say the cast of The Expendables who seem to be wondering whether they remembered to turn off the coffee maker that morning in every shot Reeves invests himself fully as a retired hit man who runs afoul of some Russian mobsters. Yes were back in the land of improbable gun fights thick accents and goonish villains just like we were during all those forgettable action pictures from the 1980s. Reeves is the only one on screen who comes close to resembling an actual person and hes practically superhuman. First-time co-directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski are former stuntmen who know how to stage an effective fist fight but the movie is so thin and lightweight it makes Denzel Washingtons The Equalizer seem like an Oscar contender (at least that movie has a fresh gimmick). After what Gareth Evans accomplished in the astonishing The Raid 2 Berandal the bar has been raised for crime thrillers. You have to bring something new to justify your place at the table and John Wick is all remixed leftovers. Still there is Reeves the rare sort of action star who seems capable of doing what his character does in real life (watch the smooth way in which he replaces empty clips on his guns while trading fire with the bad guys). John Wick reminds you what a bracing presence he can be when matched with the right role (Point Break The Matrix Speed Constantine). Why has he been sent to Hollywood jail? In interviews the actor has stated that the offers just stopped coming after The Day the Earth Stood Still flopped as if the films failure had been his fault. John Wick reminds you this actor deserves better. Reeves makes the movie entertaining in a background-noise way but he cant give it any gravity even when the filmmakers pull the cheapest trick in the book to get the audience to root for the hero and hiss at the Eurotrash villains. Someone get this man some good work quick. Cast Keanu Reeves Michael Nyqvist Alfie Allen Willem Dafoe Dean Winters. Directors David Leitch Chad Stahelski. Screenwriter Derek Kolstad.

After a marked absence from the genre Reeves resoundingly returns with an effortless kinetic style that positions the film extremely well for any potential follow-ups. With much of the marketplace distracted by awards contenders and the seasonal onslaught of horror offerings John Wick may find an opening to start building some seriously sustained momentum with both male and female Reeves fans during its initial rollout. Watch more Keanu Reeves Blows Up a Lot of Stuff in Trailer for John Wick Economically recapping the recent personal loss of retired Russian mob assassin John Wick (Reeves) in nested flashbacks following the untimely death of his wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) the opening scenes find Wick shuffling around in a fog of grief before latching on to his only remaining connection to her a beagle puppy named Daisy that Helen arranged as a gift before her passing. As he struggles to regain any sense of normalcy the dog and fond memories of his marriage give Wick some hope for the future but it proves short-lived when hes antagonized by petulant young gangster Iosef (Alfie Allen) who tries to intimidate Wick into selling his classic 1969 black Mustang. When that doesnt work Iosef and his crew break into Wicks New Jersey home to steal the car leaving him battered and bloodied before Iosef kills Daisy in a fit of pique. Wick quickly snaps back into cold-blooded killer mode even after five years on the sidelines once hes deprived of his only remaining solace determined to hunt Iosef down in retribution. Unearthing his stash of weapons and cash Wick discovers that his target is actually the son of his former gang boss Viggo (Michael Nyqvist). Fully realizing who theyre up against Viggo tells Iosef ""Its not what you did that angers me so its who you did it to"" even though hes committed to protecting his sons life by putting a 2 million price on Wicks head. First to consider the opportunity is Wicks former colleague Marcus (Willem Dafoe) a crack sniper as well as Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) a female contract killer whos as deadly as she is gorgeous. Wick checks into New Yorks Continental Hotel a declared neutral zone for mobsters of all stripes quickly getting back in touch with his old underworld contacts to begin gathering information that can lead to Iosef. After Wick nearly wipes out half the security staff in a Russian nightclub in his quest to bring down his adversary Viggo sends his son into hiding but itll clearly take more than hired assassins and subterfuge to keep John Wick from claiming his due. Read more John Wick Keanu Reeves Willem Dafoe Talk ""Fantasy"" Drifting and Gun Fu Stunts Derek Kolstads admirably lean script propels the films galvanizing action with only the barest narrative essentials quickly dispensing with the series of improbable coincidences necessitated by the initial setup. With rarely more than a quarter-hour between dynamically staged set pieces theres little time to wonder whether Wick has anything more on his mind than elemental revenge. As the body count skyrockets however the suspicion arises that he may in fact be making a final attempt at redemption by expiating his past transgressions with a final cathartic convulsion of violence dedicated to the memory of his deceased wife. Whatever his inner motivations Wick isnt one to clearly articulate them which makes the character a natural fit with Reeves typically taciturn demeanor. With his stringy dark hair scraggly beard and lithe physique hes in excellent form throughout the film whether battling his way through imaginatively staged fight sequences or handling an impressive array of firearms and lethal blades. Ironically Nyqvist may be the more persuasive one with the turn of a phrase but the outcome of Viggos final confrontation with Wick can only go one way. Although Allen doesnt get much opportunity to develop Iosef beyond a simpering spoiled brat and Palickis stone-cold killer would have benefited from a more central role those shortcomings seem incidental in a movie where caricatures are almost more important than characters. Read more Party On Dudes Alex Winter Talks Bill amp; Ted 3 Details Distilling a couple of decades of stunt work and second-unit directing experience into 96 minutes of runtime Stahelski and Leitch expertly deliver one action highlight after another in a near-nonstop thrill ride. With a tendency to favor skillfully framed master shots over quick cuts from multiple angles they immerse viewers in dynamic onscreen clashes that recall John Woos classic bullet ballets with an overlay of emotional intensity. Cinematographer Jonathan Sela bathes even daytime scenes in grim gray shadows and expressive blue hues that are sometimes broodingly dense even in Imax format further enhanced by Elisabet Ronalds focused editing.

There are no good guys in ""John Wick"" but there are some great actors working alongside Keanu Reeves in his darkest and most tormented role yet a stunningly lethal contract killer who goes on a rampage after a Russian thug murders his dog. Yes his dog. If you can stomach the setup then the rest is pure revenge-movie gold as Reeves reminds what a compelling action star he can be while the guy who served as his stunt double in ""The Matrix"" makes a remarkably satisfying directorial debut delivering a clean efficient and incredibly assured thriller with serious breakout potential thanks in part to Summits simultaneous Imax release. That unsung hero is Chad Stahelski the stunt guru who stepped into Brandon Lees shoes on ""The Crow"" and spent the next two decades absorbing all the behind-the-scenes filming lessons that make ""John Wick"" such a technically impeccable actioner. (Stahelski and longtime stunt collaborator David Leitch approached the project as a team but only Stahelski ultimately received directing credit from the DGA while Leitch is credited as a producer.) Whereas the tendency among many other helmers is to jostle the camera and cut frenetically in the misguided belief that visual confusion generates excitement the duo understand what a thrill well-choreographed action can be when were actually able to make out whats happening. And thats why Reeves serves as just the right star to play Wick a short-fuse antihero whose ridiculous moniker (borrowed from screenwriter Derek Kolstads grandfather) clumsily conveys his explosive temper. Theres nothing clumsy about the actor who plays Wick however as Reeves lithe physicality enables extended sequences in which he moves athletically through an environment full of adversaries shooting stabbing or otherwise immobilizing them one at a time. Since brutally efficient action sequences are in such short supply these days the fact that ""John Wick"" delivers no fewer than half a dozen -- home invasion hotel room Red Circle club church parking lot Brooklyn safehouse grand finale -- more than excuses Kolstads lame-brained script. Basically the idea is to mislead audiences into believing that Reeves character is a mild-mannered family man compressing the preceding few months of personal tragedy into a montage in which Wick visits his wife (Bridget Moynahan) in hospital attends her rain-drenched funeral (where former colleague Marcus played by Willem Dafoe makes an ominous appearance) and weeps upon receiving her final gift a pre-trained puppy named Daisy. This intro doesnt exactly position Wick as someone Russian mobsters would refer to as ""the Boogey Man"" but of course everyone in the theater already knows whats coming. Far from fooling anyone this mopey opening merely provides an awkward bit of melodrama to get past before the carnage can commence -- which it does soon enough when ""Game of Thrones"" goon Alfie Allen playing the bratty son of a Russian crime boss improbably shows up at a rural gas station and offers to buy Wicks prized 1969 Boss Mustang. When Wick declines the punk and his friends decide to break into his house and help themselves beating Wick with baseball bats smashing his things snapping the poor dogs neck and taking the Mustang on their way out. While killing a dog hardly seems enough to justify the meticulously orchestrated mayhem that follows we should at least be grateful the pic doesnt impose some greater emotional trauma upfront (like forcing us to witness his wifes rape or murder a la ""Death Wish""). The script waits until this moment when Iosef takes the stolen Mustang to the shop to have its plates changed before revealing Wicks reputation. The fence (a tough-looking John Leguizamo) nervously refuses to help notifying Iosefs relatively civilized mobster dad Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist looking suave and collected in the face of certain death) that his son has awakened a monster. One almost feels sorry for Stahelski whos been given such a soggy pulp screenplay to work with and yet its during these B-movie scenes that we start to feel what he can bring to the table. In terms of material ""John Wick"" is nothing special but theres a suave elegance to the way Stahelski and Leitch approach this thoroughly generic project seizing the opportunity to deliver some pretty spectacular setpieces along the way. The result photographed in sleek steady-hand widescreen by Vilmos Zsigmond protege Jonathan Sela looks more like recent Nicolas Winding Refn pics than relatively sloppy studio fare (right down to its cool neon-lit shootouts) relying on a mix of heavy metal and electronic music from the likes of Marilyn Manson Tyler Bates and Kaleida to generate propulsive forward energy. Needless to say Iosef and his thugs picked the wrong guy to mess with. But their mistake wasnt stealing Wicks car and killing his dog. Their mistake was not killing Wick when they had the chance. As written everyone seen onscreen is bad to some degree -- from the lethal minx (Adrianne Palicki) who accepts a 4 million contract to kill Wick to the corrupt Catholic priest (Munro M. Bonnell) who protects the vault where Viggo stores his valuables -- which means every bullet fired potentially stands to make this corrupt underworld a better place. Evidently evil is relative and some of these killers are more supportive of Wick than others including Dafoes Marcus a fellow sharpshooter who intervenes whenever Wick finds himself in a particularly tight spot and Ian McShane who plays the manager of the films most inspired location a high-end hotel for assassins where the house rules demand that no killing be done on premises. Clearly ""John Wick"" isnt set in the real world but rather in the sort of heightened parallel dimension that gamers use for target practice where they must constantly be on their guard as goons pop up from behind objects and around corners. Thats effectively how we experience the better part of the movie tagging along as Wick hunts down Iosef and brings down Viggos entire criminal organization in the process. With long greasy hair and wispy facial hair Reeves isnt nearly as tough or intimidating as your typical revenge-movie antihero but his star persona helps to make the film more fun -- or at least a lot less bleak -- than downbeat classics as ""Rolling Thunder"" and ""Get Carter."" All that violence wont bring Daisy back but it helps to clear enough space in Wicks cold-blooded heart for another dog. Maybe hes not so bad after all.

Nick says April 6 2015 at 434 pm This is a truly awful movie. How anyone can rate it is beyond me. Terrible plot terrible acting terrible accents and basic 90s-like action sequences. I was prepared for some dumbed down action but this was lazy stuff. Busting into a nightclub and killing 30 brainless Russian gangsters was a bit much. Then there were the other 50 lemmings throughout the rest of the movie. It was Commando esque without the humour. All characters in the movie had no semblance of character. Each scene had some awful background edgy action music to compliment the dialogue walking fighting and mourning. I love Keanu Reeves but this was utterly dull. Dont watch it The the Equalizer was good fun and pretty much exactly what this movie was trying to do. The other option is Taken though not the other two Youll probably enjoy this if youre 15. Reply rashi says January 16 2016 at 1218 am yea thats true Reply Daggard (Daggard) says January 22 2015 at 337 pm Everyone loves to pick up on the whole ""they killed his dog"" plot as the entire motivation for the character. but theres more there if youre willing to see it. John himself reveals that the ""parting gift"" from his late wife represented more than just a damn-cute animal. It represented an aid to his grief and pain form the loss. Watch the scene in which Wick reads his wifes note and see how much pain that man is in. In that moment Keanu sells the set up with one acting performance. Hes lost without her. Anyone who has lost someone whether it be due to death or just a terrible break-up knows the kind of pain Keanu is showing in that moment. Its not about the dog. Its about the right to grieve. Thats what was taken away from him and thats what he went out for revenge for. I think many people are missing the whole point of the dog what it represents and how the film does more with so little - more so than almost any of theses types of action genre films. Just a filmmaker and writers 5 cents. Reply Rohit Sharma says November 19 2014 at 419 am John Wick is far better than revenge films of similar ilk have conditioned us to expect. A vivid unique world great casting hardcore action and a hero that you empathise with and root for that isnt impervious to harm. A must watch for action movie lovers. For my detailed review please visit........http//rohitmoviereview.blogspot.in/ Reply clay says October 21 2014 at 216 pm I love my dog to death as much as any other member of my family. So while not an incredibly believable premise of a movie I can understand why he did what he did. Also cannot wait to see this So far all the reviews have been very positive Reply Jacob says October 17 2014 at 1033 am Great movie...Based on what I have seen and read to date it seems as if Chad Stahelski has a natural eye and vision for this genre. Obviously that combined with his many years in the business as a stunt guy allow for him to translate that vision... My biggest problem with movies like the Expendables 3 and others like it is that they have so much potential yet fail miserably when it comes to the action sequences...The blood and guts if you will. Its maddening...The art-form is evolving and the audience demands more these days. My biggest problem with the crap out there today is captured by the quote from the article below ""Whereas the tendency among many other helmers is to jostle the camera and cut frenetically in the misguided belief that visual confusion generates excitement the duo understand what a thrill well-choreographed action can be when were actually able to make out whats happening."" Honestly myself and my friends who went and saw Expendables 3 had absolutely no freaking clue what was going on half the time in those action sequences - Who was doing what what character was where...It was messy and all over the place...I mean...That script was no better than the John Wick script which at best is mediocre...The difference is the vision and style that brought it to life. More action films and their producers should take a lesson from John Wick. You dont need a great script - Package the right above and below the line talent try to do something different and give the movie audience who has now been exposed to the Matrix Christopher Nolan movies and Xbox better action films. Reply Steve UK says October 17 2014 at 454 am I dunno you start the review by saying Reeves is a stunningly lethal contract killer and end the review with the words Reeves isnt nearly as tough or intimidating as your typical revenge-movie antihero. Id love to see Reeves play a brutal cold blooded killer but your review isnt clear on that point. Reply aunt T says October 16 2014 at 1110 pm Another beloved hero/actor - in a poster- pointing a gun... no matter how good the film will we ever learn? Reply johnnyfrommalibu says October 16 2014 at 834 pm Namecheck ""Rolling Thunder""? Righteous Reply ActionGirl says October 16 2014 at 240 pm Why do men have no emotional depth? Every reviewer keeps focusing on the fact that hes gone after these men because of the dog. Its not specifically about the dog. Although considering the fact that the guys wife has just passed and this is the first thing hes cared about since her death you may consider the violence behind the dogs death enough of a reason to be pissed. But its about the fact that his wife who went through a long illness and knew she was going to be leaving him alone thought of leaving him something else he could love. Which is the reason hes so pissed that they killed his dog. Yes I guess to a man its schlocky. But if you want to bring in more than than the knuckle dragging man off the street into the theater to watch the very sexy Keanu Reeves beat down a bunch of guys who took away the last thing his wife left to him maybe make it a date movie where a guy could get lucky afterwards. You make this film a little sappy along with a lot of high testasterone action and fighting to bring in the female element as well. Reply Nanny Mo says October 16 2014 at 321 pm I think its more Keanu. His really dead style of acting either really works or fails big time. Hes one that can be hit or miss but when hes on hes good. Reply Zidders Roofurry says October 18 2014 at 1241 am Im not sure why stating what is made obvious by the trailer that it means the reviewer lacks emotional depth or that ALL men lack it. Im a guy and Im one hell of a sappy bastard. I cry at the drop of a hat. The fact is this movie is just an excuse for a bunch of action sequences. Theres no depth to it. Its yet another in a long line of pulpy action movies that treat the females as either disposable or as lethal sex objects. Also youre making generalizations based on gender. Gender isnt just about straight male and straight female. Theres a spectrum and some people arent into sex so its probably best if you tried not to make assumptions about entire groups of people based on harmful stereotypes. ActionGirl says October 16 2014 at 402 pm I can agree with that. JoshuaF says October 16 2014 at 202 pm Smart review. Sold me on it. Very good point about action films that rely on chaotic and frenetic camera movement in place of well done choreography. It just isnt as satisfying when you cant track the action. Reply eclectic gal says October 16 2014 at 145 pm Thanks for the review. Definitely want to see this. Love choreographed action sequences without jerky cuts. And revenge for the murder of a beloved innocent dog -- totally justified Reply clay says October 21 2014 at 217 pm Totally agree. Anybody hurts my dog they should expect equal punishment from me.

Following the jubilant post-modern martial arts efforts ""47 Ronin"" and ""Man of Tai Chi"" Reeves stars in the hugely satisfying B-movie ""John Wick"" with the confidence of an actor right where he belongs. Like Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson Reeves performances in guilty pleasure fare are both straightforward and dripping with irony with ""John Wick"" providing one of the best examples. Neither surprising or groundbreaking in any particular way the movie gives us what we want and leaves it at that. As the title character the typically monotonous thespian plays a retired hitman coping with his wifes death by finding companionship in the puppy she leaves behind. When the pet is abruptly murdered by the spoiled offspring (Alfie Allen) of a Russian crime lord (an enjoyably gruff Michael Nyqvist) Wick returns to action for one last violent streak gearing up to avenge the death of his beloved pooch. Bullets fly and bodies fall as the reformed killer gradually gets closer to his target. ""John Wick"" makes up for its lack of sophistication in the sheer eagerness it brings to the scenario. Its chief villain who puts a contract out on Wick and spends much of the movie sending his goons on ill-fated trips to take him down frequently speaks in Russian while his dialogue is subtitled in colorful glistening text that emphasizes the cartoonish nature of the proceedings. Though it never reaches the absurd heights suggested by such stylistic flourishes first-time director Chad Stahelski effectively stages a series of fast-paced showdowns with ample payoffs. When a series of masked gunmen surface at Wicks home his immediate reaction -- a blend of fast-paced physical maneuvers and gunplay -- may as well be a muscular shrug but the showdown is so fluidly staged that its impossible not to enjoy the effortless ride. And theres plenty more right around the corner. While Willem Dafoe and Adrianne Palicki offer solid turns as fellow killers from Wicks past for the most part ""John Wick"" is a showcase for Reeves that doesnt ask more from him than the usual routine. With his stony expression and robotic delivery the actor fits a plot so mechanically devised its the cinematic equivalent of a shiny wind-up doll. Sure Wicks monologue explaining his passion for his dearly departed pet borders on absurdity but when he lashes out no choppy editing obscures the action. Staheski -- whose previous credits mainly involve Hollywood stunt work -- takes his movies primary entertainment value seriously. ""John Wick"" doesnt only rest on Reeves fundamental appeal. The movies freewheeling atmosphere veers from the film noir ingredients of a shady nightclub to the more unruly low-rent qualities of the revenge narratives made by exploitation maven William Lustig 30 years ago. Set to a vibrant soundtrack of rock and techno Derek Koldstads screenplay brings the material to life with relentlessly punchy dialogue. ""You dip so much as a pinky into this pond"" one of Wicks former colleagues says ""you may find something drags you back to its depths."" Of course thats exactly the sort of pronouncement that only makes Wick stronger. Ultimately no amount of well-timed action choreography can salvage the movies humorless tone or its underwhelming climax which arrives as even more of an afterthought than the cliched premise. Fists fly and torrential rain barrels down amid terse exchanges. ""John Wick"" concludes so abruptly its almost like everyone involved gave up before they got there. At the same time one cant fault it for lunging at low-hanging fruit. Every step of the way the movies designed to satisfy expectations rather than transcending them. ""They know youre coming"" Wick is warned as he veers toward his target. ""It wont matter"" he replies and hes right. Grade B ""John Wick"" opens nationwide on October 24.
