Tim Burtons flung-poo 2001 remake squandered a lot of the goodwill amassed by the original franchise which between the years of 1968 and 1975 yielded five movies a live-action TV series and a Saturday morning cartoon. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is everything Burtons movie wasnt -- smart exciting and thought-provoking while operating in the realm of the movies great misunderstood monsters. Also read First Look Henry Cavill Dons Superman Cape Like King Kong and Godzilla before him audiences will fear the intelligent ape Caesar (played brilliantly via motion-capture animation by Andy Serkis) while also empathizing with his plight. The film stars James Franco as Will Rodman a genetics researcher testing a new drug on apes that repairs neural pathways and could potentially cure Alzheimers. (Its a personal crusade for Will whose father Charles -- played by John Lithgow -- suffers from the disease.) Also read The Change-Up a Sex Comedy That Hates Sex The drug seems to be working on a lab ape known as ""Bright Eyes"" (thats what the intelligent apes called Charlton Heston in the original movie and its one of about a dozen shout-outs to the original ""Apes"" films here) but when she goes on a rampage drug company exec Jacobs (David Oyelowo) shuts down the program. Bright Eyes didnt freak out because of the drug however; she was merely protecting her baby the one that Will takes home raises on his own and names Caesar. And while Caesar has benefited from his mothers exposure to the drug Will secretly brings the experimental formula home and start giving it to Charles who seems to be improving. As Caesar gets older Wills girlfriend Caroline (Freida Pinto playing a zoo vet so underwritten that Rosario Dawsons character in ""Zookeeper"" feels like Dr. Jane Goodall by comparison) warns him that the ape will become strong and violent. And when a pushy next-door neighbor gets into an altercation with a now-relapsing Charles Caesar lashes out and winds up getting incarcerated in a primate facility where he learns the law of the jungle -- and figures out a way to build an army against the cruel humans. Plot-wise ""Rise"" most resembles ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"" in which talking ape Caesar leads his enslaved brothers in a revolt. But while that film was more of a political parable this new one marries questions about the excesses of genetics research with a tense and suspenseful prison-break story. (The latter mirrors director Rupert Wyatts exceptional previous film ""The Escapist."") So many contemporary movies have a hard time balancing two things at once -- ""The Change-Up"" treats gross-out gags and midlife romance like they were walking and chewing gum -- that its a real pleasure to watch ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" unfold skillfully encompassing sci-fi action suspense and the Will/Caesar relationship which falls somewhere between parent/child and boy-and-his-dog. Francos not the first actor youd think of for this kind of movie but he plays it straightforwardly handling the roles emotional moments and its streams of science-babble with ease. (He also knows that billing aside this is Serkis show all the way.) Cox who spear-headed the prison break in ""The Escapist"" flips the script by playing the warden of the monkey jail and if Tom Felton wanted to avoid post-""Harry Potter"" typecasting after a decade of playing Draco Malfoy then perhaps playing Coxs sadistic chimp-taunting son wasnt the way to do it. With its army of apes chimpanzees orangutans and gorillas ""Rise"" bites off a lot effects-wise but the movie delivers some of the best motion-capture animation since ""Avatar."" Nobody gives a performance with ping-pong balls on his face like Andy Serkis as he previously proved in ""King Kong"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies and here he makes Caesar vulnerable conflicted loving and ultimately terrifying. Its not the kind of acting that wins awards but Serkis work here is mesmerizing. (Granted I miss the old-school methods where Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall were buried in layers and layers of latex to play the simian stars but when the CG is this good its hard to complain.) While there are some minor nits to be picked here -- Pintos barely-there character a rare slackening of the pace in the build-up to the big finale a few too many inside jokes for fans of the original ""Apes"" series"" -- ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" feels like a genuine summer surprise. Who would think that the dog days of August would give us one of the most genuinely appealing big-studio tentpole movies of the year? Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Largely listless and witless this extensive reworking of the 1968 sci-fi favorite simply isnt very exciting or imaginative. What seemed like a delectable pairing on paper -- Tim Burton and ""Planet of the Apes"" -- turns out to be a mismatch on the screen. Largely listless and witless this extensive reworking of the 1968 sci-fi favorite simply isnt very exciting or imaginative; most surprisingly given the material its also Burtons most conventional and literal-minded film the one most lacking in his trademark poetic weirdness and bracing flights of fancy. The brand name and enticing ingredients should produce opening biz that will warrant chest-beating from Fox enough to launch it to robust if not sensational domestic B.O. and an even more muscular international career. On the other hand a series of sequels such as the original spawned seems highly unlikely. With the talent involved as well as the advances in makeup and special effects in recent years an ""Apes"" redo seemed justifiable as these things go; certainly there was room for an edgier and more provocative table-turning of human-simian relations. But while the technology has permitted some advances -- rather mild ones as it turns out -- the scripting hits nothing but obvious and tiresome topical notes with ""political"" parallels that may generate snorts of recognition in viewers but are nothing more than cheap gags one might expect in a collegiate revue on the same subject. And when Mark Wahlberg utters the immortal line ""Never send a monkey to do a mans job"" as he sets out on his trip through time and space one cant help but think that a boy has been sent on a mans job in trying to fill Charlton Hestons loincloth. Indeed the erstwhile Dirk Diggler doesnt even risk the comparison remaining in his tattered Air Force flight suit throughout. But to see Wahlberg move with such a blank sense of purpose through this alien universe is to be reminded anew of the qualities -- physical and otherwise -- that Heston brought to intense driven heroic roles. Space-set 15-minute opening isnt bad with Wahlbergs Captain Leo Davidson on a humongous U.S. space station in the year 2029 concentrating on training chimps to pilot small ""unmanned"" pods on potentially hazardous exploratory missions. When his favorite student becomes lost in an electromagnetic storm Leo follows him in unauthorized pursuit passing through a major time warp before plummeting into a tropical forest in a sequence very like the plane crash in ""Jurassic Park III."" The lords of this jungle are only moderately less beastly than hungry raptors. Eliminating the suspensefully ominous cat-and-mouse of the earlier ""Apes"" a production that was greenlit by then-Fox production chief and this films producer Richard D. Zanuck new version reveals Leos enemies at once as some soldier apes round up a ragtag band of humans and take them to market in Ape City. Unlike the brilliant studio-created settings of so many of his other pictures Burton seems boxed in by production designer Rick Heinrichs enormous set which is neither visually appealing nor stylized in an interesting way. Before long a picture of a quasidemocratic but military-dominated ape society emerges one that puts on airs of enlightenment but still allows slavery -- of humans. Technologically it is about on a par with the Roman Empire with guns much less electricity still unknown. Muddled unexciting action sees Leo the curvaceous Daena (Estella Warren) and a few others covertly freed by quirky senators daughter Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) whose bleeding-heart interest in societys victims gives new meaning to the term ""human rights activist."" Enraged by such a betrayal apedoms ever-agitated military leader Thade (Tim Roth) convinces Aris venerable father (David Warner back again to ""Morgan"" monkeyshines at last) to declare martial law allowing him to embark on a massive search-and-destroy mission against Leo and his little group. Aside from mild crushes that both Ari and Daena develop on the oblivious Leo character development is ignored during the humans long trek toward the distant location where a signal on Leos sensor is guiding them. Nor is suspense ever a factor. The major compensation then is repped by the stunning locations through which they pass notably the Lake Powell area where much of the first ""Apes"" was lensed and the incredible Trona Pinnacles in Californias high desert. Climactic battle in which the ill-prepared humans led by unwilling savior Leo seem no match for the powerful apes is interrupted by a cute but hardly surprising ""celestial"" visitor. Despite the pleas of the two would-be girlfriends Leo decides to return to Earth. It hardly seems worth it however; without giving it away the ending (chosen from among a reported seven or eight possible ones) involves as did that of the original a famous U.S. landmark. Unlike the earlier one however this one is really really bad. When not strictly utilitarian dialogue by scripters William Broyles Jr. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal is often sophomorically on-the-nose in its human-ape role reversals. ""Extremism in defense of apes is no vice"" rants the crazed Thade while Ari laments ""Its disgusting the way we treat humans."" Comic-relief lines given to Paul Giamattis slave trader are similarly lame. Overall thesps are given little to work with although Bonham Carter is able to give her do-gooder role some shadings. While physically exuberant Roths Thade cant compare to the thesps memorable villain in ""Rob Roy."" Looking like shes received no direction at all Warren does little but stride around in her low-cut jungle garb and leg-strap sandals like a modern edition of Anita Ekberg. In someones idea of a joke original space traveler Heston enacts an uncredited deathbed scene as Thades father in which he reveals to his son that apes ""evolved"" from humans and bequeaths to him an ""ancient"" weapon -- a gun. The usual seamlessness of Burtons world is not matched here due to some jarring transitions between studio artifice and location reality. Rick Bakers ape makeup creations are wonderfully varied -- all manner of simians are present and accounted for -- and represent a definite leap beyond what was possible 33 years ago. Lenser Philippe Rousselot copes as best he can with the inconsistent visual backdrops Colleen Atwoods costume designs are sometimes striking but dont always escape cliche while Danny Elfmans score begins promisingly with unusual percussion motifs but gradually drifts toward the more conventional.

"Planet of the Apes | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; planet-of-the-apes_2304 ) Planet of the Apes (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli This remake of the 1968 film Planet of the Apes has been on the drawing board for a long time. When it was first mentioned as a serious project (rather than just the figment of Apes fans imaginations) the two prominent names attached to it were director James Cameron (pre-Titanic) and Arnold Schwarzenegger. For a while Cameron appeared serious about making the film (if not as the director then as a producer) but along came Titanic and a flood of Oscars and Planet of the Apes was placed so far on the back burner that it was for all intents and purposes near death and burial. Enter Tim Burton who came to Planet of the Apes with a new vision and his own ideas of how the franchise could be revived for a 00s audience. Under Burtons stewardship Planet of the Apes was re-born and 33 years after the first version of Pierre Boulles novel reached screens the apes are back. Burton objects to his Planet of the Apes being called a ""remake"". He prefers the term ""re-imagination"". Indeed while there are a few similarities between this film and its predecessor many of the differences are so sweeping that even those intimately familiar with the 1968 version will discover plenty of new material. Character names are not re-used - there is no Taylor no Nova no Zira no Cornelius and no Dr. Zaius. Instead we have the likes of Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) Daena (Estella Warren) Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) Krull (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and General Thade (Tim Roth). The setting is radically altered - this is not Earth of the future but another world. Ape society is structured differently and humans can speak. However in his attempts to bend the Planet of the Apes mythology to his own vision Burton has not entirely abandoned the original. The basic plot framework follows a similar path. There are occasional nods to the 1968 version in both dialogue and set design. The storys allegorical nature is still in effect condemning racism and intolerance and its no more subtle than it was three decades ago. And Apes stars Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison both make cameo appearances. (Had Roddy McDowall still been alive he surely would have also been given a part.) Planet of the Apes first became a phenomenon when the original movie was released in 1968. That film took in about five times its production cost; its success resulted in four sequels (Beneath the Planet of the Apes Escape From the Planet of the Apes Conquest of the Planet of the Apes Battle For the Planet of the Apes) a live-action television series and a Saturday morning TV cartoon. Over the years although Apes mania has abated it has never entirely evaporated - some segments of fandom rival Trekkers for devotion. Burtons resurrection of the franchise is aimed not only at those who were around for the original series but at the new generation of film-goers who may be unfamiliar with the days when Roddy McDowall and Planet of the Apes were synonymous. For the movies first half hour Planet of the Apes looks like it might be the much-needed antidote to the plague of disappointing action/adventure films that have dotted the 2001 summer release schedule. For roughly 60 minutes the movie is an exercise in intensity and frantic pacing (sometimes bordering on the chaotic). There is a lull during the protracted mid-section then things gear up for the big finale. And thats where Burton and his screenwriters blow it. Big time. The ending is a series of at least four bad decisions that begin with a dissatisfying anti-climactic resolution to the central conflict and end with a completely illogical ""shock"" sequence. In between theres even a deus ex machina intervention. Following a brief prologue on a solar system-based space station in the year 2029 Planet of the Apes shifts into high gear as astronaut Leo Davidsons one-man space pod is sucked into a time/space vortex and spit out somewhere far in the future in another part of the universe. There he crash-lands on a planet where the apes are the dominant species and humans are slaves. He is promptly captured by raiding party led by the cruel human-hating General Thade and his second in command Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) and along with other slaves including the woman Daena (Estella Warren) and her father Karubi (Kris Kristofferson) he is sold to the slave trader Limbo (Paul Giamatti). Limbo in turn sells these three to Ari (Helena Bonham-Carter) the daughter of an influential senator and a ""human lover"". With her help and the help of the former leader of the military Krull (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) Leo heads out on a journey for the ""Forbidden Zone"" where he believes he will find answers and perhaps salvation. In terms of look pace and tone this is a much different film than the 1968 version. The allegorical elements are still present but Burton has used the quantum leaps in technology to make this Planet of the Apes a far more alien environment. The directors strengths from Edward Scissorhands to Batman to Sleepy Hollow have always been his visual sense and his ability to generate a powerful sense of atmosphere and those aptitudes are much in evidence throughout this movie. The Ape City with its organic feel is a marvelous morsel of eye candy. The action sequences are not masterfully executed but they generate some tension. Without going into specifics its hard to describe how badly wrong Planet of the Apes goes at the end. Suffice it to say that the movie isnt satisfied with shooting itself in the foot one time. The epic battle between the slave humans and master apes which has the potential to be a Braveheart/Gladiator-type conflict (at least that seems to be what the filmmakers are aiming for) starts out well but ends with a whimper that is unlikely to satisfy more than a handful of undemanding viewers. Similarly the fate of the chief villain is left muddled (presumably so he can be around for a sequel). Then theres the coda which attempts to recapture the shock sensation/""Twilight Zone"" feeling of the ending of the 1968 version. For a split second this twist seems wickedly clever and ironic but a moments thought reveals it to be a cheat that makes no sense in the context of the movie. It is there simply to surprise viewers (and to pave the way for the aforementioned sequel). Such a careless and openly manipulative plot stunt rarely sits well with me and in this case it made me angry. Rick Bakers makeup is superlative improving upon the original without obliterating its memory. No one will for a moment think of the actors as people in monkey suits even though thats what the apes are. Mark Wahlberg gets the easy job and he has no trouble acting equal parts stoic and heroic. Likewise Estella Warren wears less not more and does an adequate job appearing beautiful and wild (even though she talks she doesnt have much to say). As the genocidal General Thade Tim Roth is truly frightening although his explosive performance is more reptilian than simian. Roth hasnt been this vicious since Rob Roy. Helena Bonham Carter brings a little sex appeal to her chimpanzee character and there are underplayed elements of a love triangle featuring Ari Daena and Leo. The supporting performances are all solid with Charlton Heston having a brief (but important) single-scene appearance buried under layers of Bakers latex. Perhaps the films finest moment occurs early in the proceedings right after Leo has been captured by the apes. In a wink-and-a-nod reference to the original as he grasps an ape by the leg he is kicked away with the following rebuke ""Get your stinking hands off me you damn dirty human"" If the entire movie had remained on the lofty level occupied by its first act and avoided the out-of-control spiral characterizing its climax and conclusion this version of Planet of the Apes could have bettered its predecessor.

Planet of the Apes. Photo HANDOUT Great ""Apes / Under Tim Burtons hand this sci-fi warhorse has evolved into something splendid 1 / 1 Back to Gallery PLANET OF THE APES Science fiction. Starring Mark Wahlberg Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth. Directed by Tim Burton. (PG-13. 119 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Forget ""A.I."" Forget ""Jurassic Park 3."" Hell forget even ""The Fast and the Furious."" ""Planet of the Apes"" is the summer blockbuster weve been waiting for. Director Tim Burton has rethought and re-energized the sci-fi classic now more than 30 years old and despite its familiarity has come up with a surprise-punch ending that outdoes the original yet keeps its spirit. The new ""Planet of the Apes"" is not a remake and its not a sequel. It is an amazing display of imagination. Burton (""Batman"") has given up none of his kinship with the dark alienated and subversive which has always kept him in tune with male adolescents -- and other adventurous spirits. This story set in 2029 opens in a space research station where Mark Wahlberg as Capt. Leo Davidson goes out in a pod to rescue a chimp astronaut. The chimp preceded him in a similar vehicle and disappeared in an electromagnetic storm. The whole thing gives a nice spin to NASAs simians-in- space experiments and Davidson is one astronaut who is not POd to be upstaged by a chimp. Soon there will be plenty of opportunities for that. Davidsons pod goes haywire too and the captain crash-lands on a strange planet ruled by apes who keep human slaves. The rubber masks for the apes -- created by makeup genius Rick Baker -- are much more sophisticated than those in the original 1968 film. The features and personalities of the actors like those of Jim Carrey as the Grinch -- also done by Baker -- seep through the latex. These apes -- played to greatest effect among them by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth -- not only have teeth and expressive lips and speak English some of them have false teeth too. But their noses may be their most expressive feature good for sniffing out everything from trouble to sex. SIDES WITH HUMANS Wahlbergs sex appeal is apparent even to an ape. Although Davidson finds himself at the head of a slave revolt the kohl-eyed chimp Ari (Bonham Carter) is clearly attracted to him. She defies ape leadership and sides with the humans. Fascist military honcho Thade (Roth) goes ape teeth bared and snorting. Aris interest in Davidson leaves him with an interesting dilemma Should he choose the beguiling if apelike Helena Bonham Carter or the human slave woman in loincloth played by model Estella Warren? THROWING TANTRUMS The thing to remember about these actors is that apes really can chew the scenery. These creatures may have evolved but theyre still apes. They dont disguise their feelings. There is ferocious hissing sniffing and growling. They screech and throw tantrums. Sound like anyone you know? Some of the parallels to human behavior probably are too facile. They pray to a father who created all apes in his own image. They are superstitious and science is considered sorcery. Their sacred ruins ""the secret of creation"" look something like the Gaudi cathedral in Barcelona stuck at an angle into the ground. These apes know their Shaw ""Youth is wasted on the young."" They drop common expressions ""Dont solve problems by throwing money at them."" It could become tiresome quickly even if the writers are making monkeys of the earthlings who use such phrases and is a momentarily alarming sign that the movie may be bogging down in un-Burtonlike cuteness. Burton backs off just in time. Hes like a Ringling Bros. aerialist who feints a fall in order to make his recovery all the more impressive. The look of the film has the Burton stamp. The ape planet is thick with mist and smoke. Cliff dwellings rise out of craggy wilderness landscapes. Warrior apes mounted on horses ride off in helmets armor and mesh. They use slings as weapons but Roth has a particularly good moment when he sniffs an ancient firearm. Power means what it always has Carry a big stick. FIGHTING APES The fighting apes are capable of taking great bouncing leaps and pouncing suddenly. They mount their horses with a bounce too. They are mean mothers and pound the bejesus out of their victims. One thing theyre afraid of is water -- ""Thats why every day we pray for rain"" says one of the human slaves who are sometimes held in neck restraints for branding with hot irons. There is a brief but very effective episode in the space station sequence when quick flashes of historic images from Earth have been caught as they spread out from the planet toward infinity. These images are replayed like a time-warp flashback. What Burton does with the last 20 minutes of this ""Planet of the Apes"" is the thing that sets this movie apart. For the viewers sake the less said about it here the better. Meanwhile there are wonderful touches. Danny Elfmans music particularly its pounding rhythms for the closing titles will send people ape-dancing up the aisles. Bonham Carters costumes could start a fashion trend in some circles and she holds a pencil to write with prehensile toes. Advisory This film contains violence too rough for younger children.

"USATODAY.com - Great apes rule the new Planet Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 08/02/2001 - Updated 0930 AM ET Great apes rule the new Planet By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY Planet of the Apes (out of four) Stars Mark Wahlberg Tim Roth Helena Bonham Carter Director Tim Burton Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for some sequences of action/violence Theres one reason to see Tim Burtons flawed somewhat declawed but often amusing do-over of Planet of the Apes. The apes. What else? If anyone earns the right to beat their chests over the retooling of the 1968 sci-fi landmark its makeup maestro Rick Baker and his crew. The primates are primo. Unlike the blow-dried stiffs from the original these disguises allow the power of the performer inside the ape gear to break on through. Read more Discuss What did you think of the finale? Share your thoughts with other readers Video Planet of the Apes trailer Chat Read the chat transcript with Michael Clarke Duncan Audio Tim Roth Enjoyed playing an ape Stories Review Great apes get three stars Apes finale too murky for fans Planet spins around some familiar phrases faces Apes conquer box office with record premiere Makeup master Rick Baker goes ape For Baker going ape was an evolutionary process Theater owners have great Ape expectations The gorillas chimps and orangutans debate race relations religion and welfare reform at dinner parties engage in kinky mating rituals and in the case of the female chimps display a nice woodsy fashion sense. They rage they roar they rule. And from the way the fur flies up and down the scenery they have obviously seen Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. They also declare war once a visitor from beyond (Mark Wahlberg as the crash-landed astronaut) incites a rebellion among the human slaves on their planet. Dont make the mistake of thinking them totally civilized. They are after all animals. As General Thade the leader of the simian military Tim Roths chimp is one gnarly hairball of snarling male aggression. His performance may be one-note but what a fine fierce note it is. Hes balanced by Paul Giamattis jester a slimy slave trader of an orangutan named Limbo who isnt above selling a human child as a pet and tossing in a collar for free. The apes dont just loathe humans they consider them repulsive even toxic vermin. You might not disagree after seeing what passes for our species. Compared with Charlton Hestons tasty slab of boastful beefcake as the first films space jockey who fell from the sky and into an ape-centric future Wahlberg is a pasty puff pastry. Just another lost Dorothy who wants to go home from Oz. The enslaved yet defiant Homo sapiens who come to see Wahlberg as their messiah -- including Kris Kristofferson in a dont-sneeze-or-youll-miss-him part vacantly beautiful Estella Warren and whiny teen Luke Eberl -- do little to strengthen the case for mankinds superiority. The humans talk this time but have nothing to say. Its enough to make you want to stop shaving and devolve. One also must praise Helena Bonham Carter as Ari a rich girl chimp with a powerful pop (David Warner) liberal leanings and a soft spot for humans. And Wahlberg in particular. She is the typical Burton misfit an outcast for her sentiments and she does a miraculous job of weaving ape-ishness (sniffs screeches and waddle) into her usual dramatic repertoire as she leads the human rabble to freedom like a downy Harriet Tubman. As for quirky iconoclast Burton who is no stranger to high-pressure summer blockbusters after surviving Batman and Batman Returns he still cant sustain a compelling narrative -- though he can do the action scenes pretty well. Its in the corners of the screen where youll catch him having his way with the notion of a topsy-turvy ape society with jokey bits. Hestons brief role as Thades dying father will either touch or tickle you especially when the NRA supporter is the only ape with a gun. And Fans of the first Planet will greet repeated catchphrases like old chums. As for the attempt to top the original shockeroo ending its up to you to decide whether its a ""hmm"" or a ""huh?""

The films star Mark Wahlberg was reportedly so excited about the prospect of working with director Tim Burton that he signed on before there was a finished script. Note to Wahlberg always wait for the script before signing on the dotted line. Filmmaking is all about telling a story and ever since ""The Jazz Singer"" it all begins with the written word. If it aint on the page it aint on the stage and a bad script equals a bad movie. And this is one really bad script. Its a shame because visually the film is astounding. Burtons bold style and unique point of view are front and center. Yet ""Apes"" is a classic example of ""all dressed up with nowhere to go."" Production designer Rick Heinrichs who won an Oscar for Burtons ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999) and costume designer Colleen Atwood Oscar-nominated for the same film create a wondrous world of jungles and deserts where apes rule over humans. Six-time Academy Award-winner Rick Baker has done it again with his stunning makeup skills. The apes are frighteningly realistic. Unfortunately that reality only underlines the weakness of the script.

Hes played in a performance of gnashing wit and ferocity by Tim Roth who gives him the exaggerated rolling-shoulder swagger of a pint-size simian John Wayne. This Napoleonic fascist is no one to mess with; he regards the human race as dirt beneath his foot-paws. Roth a terrific scenery chewer has mastered the essential principal of ape acting as laid down 33 years ago by its patron saint Roddy McDowall From beneath the rubbery layers of Rick Bakers makeup Roth uses everything at his disposal - voice operatic body language the angle of his eyes - to imprint Thade with the force of his own personality. Several of the other actors make compelling apes as well - notably Helena Bonham Carter all curled lips and cooey caressing sweetness as Ari a kind of animal-rights activist who believes in protecting the dignity of the human slaves around her. She also happens to be the most soulful beauty on the planet though I have to say that she might have been even cuter had she not been stuck with Brenda Vaccaros hair. As the orange-bearded orangutan Limbo a charming old sissy who trades humans as slaves and pets Paul Giamatti the actor whose anthropoid makeup has been most directly patterned after his own features does small wonders with his saintly sad eyes and cowardly-lion quaver. No doubt The apes in Planet of the Apes have character. It may or may not be one of the films overdeliberate zoological ironies that Mark Wahlberg as the space-wrecked Air Force pilot who leads a ragtag band of humans in revolt comes off as a distinctly less interesting form of primate. The 1968 Planet of the Apes is fondly remembered for a great many reasons. The humanoid-gorilla makeup was at the time unprecedented in its elastic expressiveness and the story taken from Pierre Boulles novel had a fearful sci-fi charge that was thrilling in its very blatancy. The films comic-book racial overtones crude as they may look now carried a bold symbolic immediacy amid the heat and tumult of the civil rights era and the whole production was staged with an irresistible end-of-the-empire vastness even if it all looks far cheesier than the way you remember it. (Viewed today that ""spectacular"" white-boulder ape city might be a shopping center patronized by the Flintstones.) I doubt however that Planet of the Apes would ever have hooked so powerfully into its era spawning four sequels had it not been for the grizzled self-righteousness the nearly totemic overacting of Charlton Heston. Caged stripped mocked led around in dirty rags by his ape tormentors his noble airman wasnt just oppressed he was all but violated. When he finally let loose with ""Take your stinkin paws off me you damn dirty ape"" Heston was the very image of Hollywood - of America - fighting to retain its virility in a world that had seized the power to lay the establishment low. Mark Wahlberg his physical bravura rippled by undercurrents of moody protest can be an actor of quiet charisma but in Planet of the Apes hes a blank; he comes as close as possible to being a generic hero. In the midst of chimp research at an outer-space station his Captain Davidson straps himself into a pod that looks like a giant electric razor and ends up having a close shave with an electromagnetic storm crash-landing on the ape planet. Imprisoned he leads a handful of slaves on what is essentially a protracted great escape but theres precious little urgency to the flight. Burton abandoning any pretense of Gothic poetic style shoots most of the movie in monotonous woodland darkness and Wahlberg has been given virtually nothing to do except react to immediate physical ordeals. The script is a busy sometimes amusing babble of ape-human double entendres and tidbit tolerance lessons (an ape forces Davidsons mouth open and rasps ""Is there a soul in there?"") most of it draped over a routine action skeleton. Since all of the humans talk this time the notion that theyre regarded as ""lowly"" while certainly unjust isnt resonant enough to stir audience outrage. Besides with Kris Kristofferson coming on like Nick Nolte in Neptune curls and Estella Warren scampering around in a pointlessly conservative version of Raquel Welch prehistoric-wear what the human race in this movie seems most in need of being saved from is the perils of threadbare screenwriting. Are there surprises? A couple of big-money ones notably the ludicrous would-be jaw-dropper of a finale. Yet Planet of the Apes whose makers have claimed that it is less a remake than a reimagining features backlot spectacle a cast-of-hundreds battle a weak whisper of gladiatorial vengeance - everything in fact but imagination. Following Sleepy Hollow with its ye-olde slasher repetitiveness camouflaged by virtuoso displays of ground fog the movie is all but destined to become Burtons second hit in a row. Lets hope that he uses his newly restored power in Hollywood to become an artist again.
