BOTTOM LINE A brilliant premise but the movie avoids sharp satire in favor of tepid romance. CAST David Duchovny Demi Moore Amber Heard LENGTH 135 Its not hard to imagine a family like the one in ""The Joneses"" actually not a family at all but a group of salespeople subliminally pushing new products on unwitting neighbors. While the Joneses make their numbers the real families around them are borrowing and spending to keep up. Its a brilliant premise; Americans are so accustomed to dishonest marketing that it sounds more plausible than satirical. And coming on the heels of a crushing recession fueled by financial recklessness the movie brims with potential for sharp commentary. (Its no accident that the Joneses call themselves a ""cell"" terrorist-style.) advertisement | advertise on newsday David Duchovny plays Steve an aging ladies man who is starting to wonder why his only family is a fake one. Hes not even head of the house; thats Kate (Demi Moore) whos too busy shilling to return his advances. Their ""children"" are beautiful but troubled Jenn (Amber Heard) has a weakness for married men while Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) hides more than one secret identity. There are moments of shrewd meta-humor The Joneses boss is played by Lauren Hutton who as a model has peddled her share of aspirational glamour. And the films parade of logos - Audi Krups Stella Artois - mocks the product placements so common in movies. EntertainmentTrailer The Joneses But first-time writer-director Derrick Borte keeps his tone disappointingly light and safe. Hes more interested in the tepid romance between Steve and Kate than in making any salient points and his few nods to morality feel obligatory not genuine. ""The Joneses"" starts with a great pitch but ultimately fails to close the deal.

All sizzle and not much steak ""The Joneses"" (as in ""keeping up with ... "") supposes a world in which advertising is so pervasive your next-door neighbors could be ""stealth marketers"" hawking the latest in electronics cars and booze and subliminally directing you and your credit cards into the abyss. Its not much of a stretch actually and given the state of the as-yet-unrecovered economy Derrick Bortes writing-directing debut may be the feel-bad movie of the season. Low-wattage star power (David Duchovny Demi Moore) may brighten the films prospects but in the end profligacy is just so (early)-2008. Serving as its own metaphor ""The Joneses"" is set in an upscale suburb (the pic was shot in Atlanta) where a ""sales cell"" has taken up residence in a mini-McMansion The decor of said home -- the entrance to which looks like the cover of a Pier 1 catalog -- is only slightly less artificial than the ""family"" inside Steve (Duchovny) Kate (Moore) Jenn (Amber Heard) and Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) all of whom have major problems not least of which is Jenns nymphomania (which has her climbing into Steves bed on the first night). None of these people are related save for a shared amorality that encompasses lying cheating and commercial espionage. None of them have any redeeming qualities except Steve whos new and still harbors some sense of decency -- which of course raises the question of how he got in this to begin with. But its just one of the movies mysteries -- a chasm over which the viewer must make a gigantic leap of faith followed by a twisting backflip over everything else that doesnt make sense. If ""The Joneses"" were pure farce which it isnt Borte could have gotten away with a lot. Likewise the pic might have succeeded if it were all a bit funnier and a little less mean-spirited about spending debt and envy. (The reason successful social satire is so rare is the human propensity for preaching.) Its clear from the outset that the film is headed for that big redemptive moment in which everyone sees the light (or a glimmer at least) and people realize that conspicuous consumption is no substitute for love compassion or (cue the organist) family. When those moments of clarity arrive the musical accompaniment fills the viewers ears with maple syrup. Lauren Hutton has a few good moments as KC the mastermind behind what Kate Steve and their ""progeny"" are perpetrating against the neighborhood (personal responsibility not being a big theme here). But one does wonder how such a scheme would play out How would the children be registered at school? Who would the mysterious marketing company have bought the house from and why wouldnt someone have spilled the beans? And how would so many well-off people not have a clue about a family that has so much despite no visible means of support? Especially Larry (Gary Cole) the next-door neighbor whose wife Summer (Glenne Headley) is sort of the local Amway dealer (although her product is holistic pharmaceuticals) and who really needs a friend. What he gets is Steve -- no wonder hes miserable. Duchovny isnt stretching here but hes charming as Steve the conscience of the piece. Moore whose innate iciness is perfect when Kate is the true believer is less successful when the character is thawed and thinking. Hollingsworth does a nice enough turn as the closeted Mick but Heard more or less steals the show mixing sexiness with a caustic attitude that personifies even better than Moore the kind of personality that might become one of ""The Joneses "" merchandising terrorists.

The Joneses Fair Director Derrick Borte. Cast David Duchovny Demi Moore Gary Cole. Rating R for language sex teen drinking and drug use. Kate his beautiful wife spends her days at salons and expensive shops when shes not planning lavish parties. Their children Mick and Jenn are the envy of all the kids in high school just that little bit cooler than everyone else. Meet the Joneses - as in keeping up with. Thats the point both with the family and the film. Director Derrick Borte who also wrote the script (based on a story by Randy T. Dinzier) creates what starts as a scathing satire on consumerist culture mocking our insatiable appetite for things the biggest television the nicest furniture a club that will straighten out your golf swing even as it adds 20 yards to your drive. If its the nicest latest trendiest product on the market the Joneses have it. And everyone else wants it. David Duchovny is well-cast as the charmingly insincere Steve a guy who clearly loves his expensive toys but not so much that youre put off by it. Demi Moore also is good as the cold controlling Kate. Ben Hollingsworth and Amber Heard play their children both of whom have secrets upon secrets even more so than most teenagers. Gary Cole and Glenne Headley meanwhile are outstanding as the Joneses neighbors Larry and Summer. Larry is pathetically drawn in to keeping up with Steve and his lifestyle. Summers feelings are more complex; as a saleswoman for Mary Kay-type products shes both resentful and envious. Theyre a sad couple with little at the core of their relationship little except again things a point Borte gets at successfully. Theres a nicely cynical streak at the heart of ""The Joneses"" until Borte goes soft and lets the audience off the hook. Not without some sacrifice mind you but his film would have been much better had it stuck to its guns as social commentary and not lapsed into a predictable and predictably lame love story. If this sounds somewhat vague thats by design. The entire film hinges on a crucial fact about the family one we learn pretty early. But going in youre better off not knowing the truth about the Joneses. Unlike some of the neighbors youll find out before its too late. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzariz onarepublic.com.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED April 14 2010 at 1224 pm | UPDATED May 6 2016 at 453 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive linemen can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Demi Moores been busy and impressive in a slew of recent indies -- playing a frustrated diamond-company exec opposite Michael Caine in ""Flawless"" and an aggravated older sister in ""Happy Tears."" As intense as she can be onscreen (her husky delivery adds to the atmosphere) she doesnt strain to be taken seriously as an actor. That may be a reason she often isnt. Yet her focus also makes her compelling. Shes one reason to see writer-directors Derrick Bortes zeitgeist fable ""The Joneses."" Though shes not the only one. Moore portrays Kate Jones wife of Steve (David Duchovny) mother of yearbook- ready highschoolers Jenn and Mick. Only Kates none of those roles. Shes the point person in a ""cell"" created to sell. In the clever entertaining movie the happy attractive faux family embeds in a gated community to sell their neighbors a bill of luxury goods -- from fancy frozen foods to the finest golf clubs to sleek midlife-soothing roadsters. ""If its too good to be true it probably is"" is a caution neighbors have forgotten. Next-door couple the Symonds are especially vulnerable to the perfect familys pitches. Larry (Gary Cole) and Summer (Glenne Headly) have the six-figure house but not the ease of their new neighbors. She clumsily sells a line of cosmetics. Hes trying to keep up with the proverbial and now real-life Joneses. His efforts have ups and downs to put it mildly. Borte stays doggedly true to his concept; perhaps because the director came to filmmaking by way of commercials he overstates how easily free will is contorted by the free-marketing come-ons. Save one classmate almost everyone is wowed by the Joneses. ""Everyones drinking your Kool-Aid"" she tells Mick as they embark on a friendship. The Joneses arent grifters exactly. The expensive ""toys"" are real. No money changes hands. But they are frauds. Over time they begin to resemble big-screen undercover cops. Theyre either gonna lose sight of their ""true identities"" or want to come up for air. Amber Heards Jenn is bored to tears by teen boy libido. Mick teeters on the verge of disclosure. Former car salesman Steve wonders if their profession isnt a bit unseemly. Kates the only one true to the job description. From time to time KC (Lauren Hutton) arrives at the Joneses McMansion as the rather Faustian boss responsible for placing families into susceptible communities. She charts their sales numbers. She motivates them. Shes not above a little divide and conquer to keep her employees competitive. Those Joneses sure can move product. But like any family true or false they turn out to have issues.

But you didnt because its awfully difficult to remain ignorant of a movies premise when buffeted by the waves of news coverage trailers and advertising that every movie bleeds in the weeks before its release.As it happens that steady intrusion of advertising advertorial and advertainment into our everyday lives is one of the themes that propels ""The Joneses"" a well-conceived if imperfect high-concept drama written and directed by Derrick Borte. As the movie begins one of the first things we hear is a voice praising the smooth ride of a snappy new car and one of the first things we see is a hand brushing clean the prominently displayed logo of that cars maker. The voice and the hand belong to David Duchovny who plays Steve Jones the patriarch of an attractive family moving into a gated community -- the kind of exurban Shangri-La where even the non-infirm travel around in golf carts.At first you may think as a result of that literal logo-polishing that youre watching a movie that has sold its soul entirely to product placement. Either that or a canny satire of product placement. As the family -- in addition to Steve theres lovely mom Kate (Demi Moore) and two kids in high school (Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth) -- moves into its impeccably staged McMansion you may wonder if the movie is yet another lamentation on suburban spiritual emptiness. As they meet their desperate-to-seem-desperately-happy neighbors (Gary Cole and Glenne Headley) youll guess its an expos on the corrosive effects of wealth on the soul. And as things get weirder and weirder between family members you may become nervous that youre watching a drama about parents and children on the edge.""The Joneses"" is all those things to its credit and its detriment and as its gimmick dawns on you about 20 minutes in youll find its various pieces fall into place with a satisfying click. For a while its a smart nervy satire that makes good use of its actors. Duchovnys easy charm and his uneasy mien have rarely been put to better use than as Steve who makes friends effortlessly but is having trouble keeping a secret from the world. And the brittle driven Kate the real engine behind the familys social success is the best role that Moore has had in years; like Moore herself Kate is a product as much as she is a person but theres real warmth underneath the logo. As the kids Heard and Hollingsworth two handsome specimens make for a great running gag on Hollywoods inability to cast anyone under the age of 24 as a high-schooler.Unfortunately the movies second half drags never again achieving the first halfs level of narrative dexterity. By the end ""The Joneses"" feels a little too satisfied with its own admittedly clever conceit and for the broad leeway it allows itself in the creative bandying of logos and slogans. Which cellphone is best for hysterically calling your married lover? Which riding mower looks nicest at the bottom of a pool? Thanks to the movies extensive -- and for story purposes crucial -- product placement youll know. ""The Joneses"" not only gets to have its cake and eat it too it also gets to hold the Betty Crocker box up to the camera and tell you why it tastes so good.Contains profanity nudity teen drinking and drug use. 3 stars (if you dont already know what the movies about); 2 stars (if you do) Want to go? 0 Been there? 0 Rate it 0 Share Recently Reviewed Creative Control Eye in the Sky Hello My Name Is Doris KTown Cowboys Miracles from Heaven Remember The Bronze The Confirmation The Divergent Series Allegiant The Divergent Series Allegiant The IMAX Experience Embrace of The Serpent (El abrazo de la serpiente) Knight of Cups Top The Joneses Find x Showtimes x Current Location Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by Email Share on Pinterest Share on Google Plus Share on Tumblr Add to Go Out List Print 0 0 Going Out Guide Home Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Movies Trailers In Theaters Coming Soon Critics Picks Top Box Office Events Music Museums Theater amp; Dance Visitors Guide Follow Us Homepage | Sign in | Talk to Us | Newsletters Copyright (c) 2016 The Washington Post x Share on Facebook Share your Want to go and Been there lists with Facebook friends.

Slick as a pig and reeking of phony sympathy for recession-wracked consumers ""The Joneses"" is a black comedy about stealth marketing made by a filmmaker whos evidently much too close to the subject to bite the hand that feeds him. The premise is initially promising A phony family moves into a McMansion in a gated community. Theyve been contracted by a shadowy corporation to encourage the locals to buy high-end goods -- everything from frozen appetizers to Mount Everest expeditions -- they dont need and in many cases probably cant afford. The team is headed by Kate (Demi Moore) a cold-blooded veteran of the system who quickly networks her way into the generic community as do her fake high-school kids Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) and Jenn (Amber Heard). But Kates new ""husband"" Steve (David Duchovny) who is flogging luxe golf products has trouble making his numbers. Formerly a top car salesman Steve is distracted by the thought that he might want to actually share a bedroom with his attractive new ""wife."" The closeted Mick is pushing video games and Jenn is encouraging her pals to buy diet pills and cosmetics but their own sexual desires begin causing some problems. And then theres Kates even icier boss (70s supermodel Lauren Hutton) who encourages Steve by putting him in a secret competition with his ""wife."" All of this plays out as increasingly artificial even as their neighbors (Gary Cole very good and Glenne Headly) are choking on debt from literally trying to keep up with the Joneses. ""The Joneses"" is the first feature from veteran commercial director Derrick Borte and it seems like hes far less interested in the neighbors sad fate than the shiny new Audi that receives such a prominent product placement in the movie.

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday April 16 2010 242 AM Title The Joneses A sharp sendup of suburban conformity and American materialism ""The Joneses"" does burn through its credit by the end. But its flashy enough to catch our eye and keep our interest nearly all the way through.Demi Moore and David Duchovny are Kate and Steve Jones a yuppie couple who move with their children (Amber Heard Ben Hollingsworth) into the biggest McMansion in the nicest subdivision in their perfectly manicured town. Within 24 hours their neighbors are awed by their beauty their confidence and most of all their stuff the best cars electronics and clothes that money can buy.The coolest couple on their block the Joneses inspire everyone around them to live - well bigger if not exactly better. And soon their neighbors are spending madly regardless of the cost. Turns out though that the Joneses have a secret Theyre far from the perfect family they appear to be.To say more would spoil the fun because writer/director Derrick Bortes got a true ace up his sleeve. He knows it too and has a grand time setting up his house of cards.Regrettably hes not quite sure what to do once it collapses as it inevitably must. And the movies most awkward scenes which include a few grand speeches and obvious conclusions give the film the occasional feel of a concept in search of a plan.Still things do work more often than not. The all-important production design perfectly captures a generation of unthinking consumers. And Moore and Duchovny who have great chemistry are strong enough to make the most of a script that really needed another rewrite.Like Jason Reitmans ""Up in the Air"" ""The Joneses"" comes at the right time reflecting our flaws and fears in a way thats both immediately apparent and distinctly uncomfortable. A first-time filmmaker Borte doesnt yet possess Reitmans assured skill either on the page or behind the camera. But this sly satire is a very promising start. Next time he just needs to keep up with his own imagination.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Joneses  1/2 (out of four) Stars Demi Moore David Duchovny Gary Cole Glenne Headley Lauren HuttonDirector Derrick BorteDistributor Roadside AttractionsRating R for language some sexual content teen drinking and drug useRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Joneses live by their own commandments. At the top of the list is Thou Shalt Covet Thy Neighbors Goods. And theyre the neighbors with the goods. Demi Moore and David Duchovny star as Kate and Steve Jones a pseudo-married couple with a pair of stand-in teenage kids. They move into an affluent neighborhood with the express purpose of enticing their status-conscious neighbors to desire all their cool stuff. MORE David Duchovnys life calms down As a team of highly paid marketing reps working for a vaguely sinister company called Life Image the Joneses masquerade as the perfect family. Their goal is to sell an array of consumer goods from cocktails in juice boxes to flash-frozen sushi to high-tech golf clubs and high-priced jewels. The faux family is the embodiment of product placement. Its a deliciously cynical premise and for the first half of the movie its very funny. Steve golfs and Kate goes to the salon -- subtly selling all the while. Kids Jenn (Amber Heard) and Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) quickly become popular at their new high school showing off their gadgets. The Joneses throw lots of parties in their meticulous manse. Its their luxurious lifestyle thats doing the selling; theyre coached by their boss (Lauren Hutton). As the Talking Heads once sang ""This is not my beautiful house. This is not my beautiful wife."" Duchovny is charmingly wry. Hes always best in cynical mode but unfortunately hes forced to sermonize. Moore is believable as an ambitious businesswoman but its hard to buy her metamorphosis as she falls for her make-believe husband. Crass materialism and ridiculous marketing ploys are skewered by writer/director Derrick Borte in this uneven cautionary tale that starts off incisively funny then devolves into preachiness.

They pretend to be a family but arent.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted April 16 2010""Were going to do some damage in this town"" David Duchovny merrily declares to his beautiful wife daughter and handsome son as their gleaming SUV rolls up behind the big moving truck in the driveway of their new McMansion.And damage they do - but mostly to themselves - in The Joneses an overobvious and underwhelming satire about American consumerism run amok. For all its timely allusions to living beyond ones means - to credit card debt mortgage foreclosures and financial ruin - writer/director Derrick Bortes film fails to add anything new or illuminating to the Great Recession debate.In The Joneses Duchovny is Steve Demi Moore is Kate. Theyre Mr. and Mrs. Perfect right down to the little love pecks and matching PJs. But at the end of the day when the neighbors have gone home and the lights get switched off Steve and Kate retire to separate bedrooms. Even their teen-model kids are a sham. The Joneses arent really a family at all. Theyre a new kind of stealth marketing team one that blows into an affluent community sets themselves up as the family that has it all and compels their neighbors to keep up with the Joneses by buying the same branded foodstuffs and jewelry fashions and electronics. A town of happy materialists spending like theres no tomorrowOf course maintaining such an illusion is impossible - at least it is when Steve a former golf pro and car salesman in his first gig as a ""self-marketer"" starts to seriously fall for Kate a hard-nosed veteran in this game. It doesnt help that pretty Jenn (Amber Heard) ostensibly in high school embarks on an affair with an older married guy or that her ""brother"" Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) seems to be more attracted to the boys than the girls.Duchovny and Moore play this business dry and arch and Gary Cole and Glenne Headly bring a comic edge to their portrayals of the Jones-wannabes next door. Heard and Hollingsworth too seem right for their jobs but almost everything about The Joneses from the transparent plot twists to the winking irony of the golf-course patter falls flat.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Theyre handsome and genial all-Americans whom everyone instantly likes and would like to be. As the Joneses drive into the wealthy suburban area where their new home is Steve smiles and says ""We are gonna do some serious damage in this town."" Damage? The people in this upmarket community instantly fall in love with the Joneses. Kate and Steve fit into their new surroundings forming a special bond with their next-door neighbors Larry (Cary Cole) and Summer (Glenne Headly) as quickly and easily as Jenn and Mick become BFFs at the local high school. Ooh and look at all the cool stuff -- the golf clubs electronics cosmetics -- thats already in the Joneses lavishly appointed new digs. This family has everything and everyone else wants it all. Is it affordable? Well worry about that later. (See how Americans are spending now.) In movies no family is perfect -- especially not here in writer-director Derrick Bortes entertaining moral screed of a film. We get a hint of that at the end of their first day in their new neighborhood as Kate grills Steve about his conversations at the golf course. ""Did you make friends?"" she asks and he replies ""I did. I made friends."" But he dines alone. That night Steve leaves Kate to sleep in a separate bedroom and then Jenn tiptoes in to have sex with him. When Kate breaks up the tryst Jenn says ""Sorry Dad."" Yes the Joneses have a secret and its not incest. Nor are they vampires exactly (though that would make this clever social comedy easier to sell). Professional leeches is more like it. Now heres the SPOILER ALERT -- the reading of which will deprive the viewer of some nice surprises a third of the way through The Joneses but without which any consideration of the film would be horribly hobbled. The four members of the Jones brood are stealth marketers assembled as an ideal family by a ""style marketing"" firm called Life Image. The company knows that consumers dont buy the product; they buy the salesman. And theyre more likely to purchase something if they think the salesman is a real person like the new family of above-average citizens down the block. Those Life Image products will sell themselves thanks to the radiant example of the Joneses. Buy like them and be like them. Their neighbors dont realize that Steve and Kates so-called life is one big Tupperware party. (See the 100 best movies of all time.) Steve and Kate Mick and Jenn are the logical satirical extension of those college-age kids paid by companies to sit in a bar or a Starbucks and get overheard singing the praises of some fabulous gewgaw. In a larger sense the Joneses are the smiling faces of our consumer-credit addiction. Theyre the pushers -- those nice folks at the bank say selling balloon mortgages to poor people in the mid-2000s -- in a country addicted to instant gratification. The bitter lesson the Joneses neighbors find out in the storys final act and that most Americans learned in late 2008 (when the movie was shot) is that eventually somebody has to pay up. And the cost could be your money and your life. END SPOILER ALERT. Tone is everything in a social fable and for most of the movie Borte a German-born video director making his first feature shows an impressive command of mood and pace. Until Steve sees the real damage he has wreaked and belatedly gets a conscience Borte doesnt push your face into the message of conspicuous consumerism; he lets the characters and actors breathe allowing viewers to detect the toxic undertaste in their own good time. Duchovny (much more relaxed than in his X Files days) and Moore (getting her first decent role of the millennium) make a convincing couple. On the surface theyre still cozy-cuddly in their 40s a pair to admire and envy; behind the fancy facade they are riven with job stress while still trying to make the business of a marriage work. In its amiable ambling way The Joneses is a zeitgeist film it says as much as a Michael Moore screed about the American way of debt. Its also a feature-length joke about Hollywoods mania for product placement -- and an instructively entertaining way to spend an evening with no hidden charges. See pictures of movie costumes.

"Movie review aThe Jonesesa - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Demi MooreMovie review aThe JonesesaDavid Duchovny and Demi Moore star as a pretend family whose goal is to inspire conspicuous consumption.April 16 2010|By Michael Ordona Special to the Los Angeles Times In an ideal world it wouldnt be necessary to reveal the sublime conceit of ""The Joneses"" in order to review the film. Alas ours is a realm of planned obsolescence next big things and false advertising. So for those who a reasonably a require more than a general endorsement of the movies cleverness timeliness and strong performances here goes A perfect-seeming family moves into an upscale neighborhood generating envy and yes a scramble to keep up with them. How perfect are they? Dad Steve and mom Kate are played by David Duchovny and Demi Moore; the kids are gorgeous Amber Heard (in her best role to date) and handsome Ben Hollingsworth; and they have every shiny new thing high-end consumers didnt realize they needed. The catch? Theyre not a real family. Theyre an advertising construct four ace salesmodels hired by a stealth marketing company to make everyone around them want everything they have in the hopes of becoming everything the Joneses pretend to be. But when neighbors Larry and Summer get caught up on the ever-accelerating status treadmill disaster threatens. Great idea. And first-time writer-director-producer Derrick Borte delivers on its promise with plenty of help from his fine cast. As the units commander Moore balances steely Kates career goals with a growing attraction to Steve. As the teams newest member Duchovny lets his charisma loose on the Audi-driving rubes around town. A lesser actor might set his charm on cruise control; Duchovny is smart enough to let Steve not know everything. His learning curve is steep a and precipitous. The familys subtle sales pitches are expertly tuned and may feel unsettlingly familiar. ""The Joneses"" is a list of grievances nailed to the door of the Church of Materialism but the hammer never hits the audiences fingers. This may be due to Bortes advertising background and interest in subliminal marketing that spawned the story and to the movies sly humor and occasional bouts of sexiness. But more likely its the filmmakers refusal to make easy targets of the privileged worshipers of stuff who are manipulated by the Joneses. Larry and Summer have deep feelings and serious relatable concerns. In these meaty roles veterans Gary Cole and Glenne Headly dont squander their opportunities. Headly is touchingly brittle while Coles Larry is such a convincingly good guy with genuine concern for his wifes happiness that the portrayal doesnt give the audience room to dismiss him as some cardboard cut-out representative of the A1/4ber-consumerist class. The ending feels a bit rushed and incongruous but the film never leaves behind the humanity of its characters especially Steves as he finds his true self while playing the ""perfect"" version of himself. After all even the faux-Joneses have to face at some point the question of what theyre really selling a and how much of themselves is included in the price. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Another Happy DayNovember 18 2011Lauren Hutton I havent slept in 10 yearsApril 18 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTDemi MooreKateGary ColeCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-joneses-20100416,0,7297589.story",200,thejoneses13,thejoneses,latimes

The recent romcom ""Valentines Day"" smuggled in plugs for Apple Toyota Cadillac Sony Chanel and 50 other brands according to the marketing website brandchannel.com. ""Up in the Air"" was financed in part by Hilton Hotels and American Airlines in exchange for screen time. Now comes the most audacious example yet. ""The Joneses"" is a feature-length commercial wrapped in an anti-consumerist stealth-marketing satire. Steve Jones (David Duchovny) his wife Kate (Demi Moore) and their teenagers Jennifer (Amber Heard) and Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) are strikingly attractive tastemakers. As this ""family"" settles into their new McMansion in a country-club community movers unload a sultans trove of interior decor top-shelf electronics designer clothes and head-turning sports cars. The Joneses quickly befriend the neighbors hosting parties where they proudly display their brand-name toys. The Joneses you see are not a Gatsbyesque family at all but a stealth sales unit. They are assigned to promote their clients goods to unsuspecting friends who in turn persuade others creating ""a ripple effect."" Since Steve wheels his co-workers into town with a cheery ""Were going to do some real damage here"" and declares ""He who dies with the most toys wins"" you are forewarned that things may not turn out well. When a neighbor drinks too much of the Joneses materialist Kool-Aid and winds up at the bottom of a swimming pool the ripple effect they make is not what they intended. Duchovny and Moore share a smug self-regarding onscreen presence thats well-suited to these roles. They are vacuous and bland like personal shoppers whose smiles have been plastered on too long. Kate a calculating careerist has had a dozen previous assignments and does not sleep with her temporary husbands much to Steves chagrin. the joneses  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language some sexual content teen drinking and drug use. In an amusing reversal cougar extraordinaire Moore pitches a fit when their nubile ""daughter"" makes a play for Duchovny. Theres some poignant drama in the mix too. As neighbors just barely holding on to their privileged lifestyle Gary Cole and Glenne Headley are surprisingly moving secondary characters. In the saw-that-coming finale Steve develops a conscience Kate reconsiders her aversion to actual family life and the ""kids"" go through their own rites of passage. What should have been a razor-sharp comedy goes blunt as the story loses its nerve and devolves into a routine morality tale. The film asks welcome questions about what price we should be willing to pay for ""the good life"" but ultimately it cant close the deal.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Who even talks about keeping up with the Joneses anymore?Considering that nowadays our envy can be directed at just about anyone with secure employment and a car that doesnt accelerate on its own havent the stereotypical Joneses gone the way of time-share condos and personal bread-making machines? Not that were any less driven by consumption but most of us sure dont brag about our spending habits.Still here comes the new movie ""The Joneses acting as though its the timeliest of stories and pretending it has something creative and important to say.Instead this disposable dramedy from first-time writer-director Derrick Borte and co-writer Randy T. Dinzler offers little more than standard Hollywood piffle dolled up with extra-slick product placements for the latest greatest stuff that money can buy. Its cute and clever to a point -- especially if you dont know much about the films premise going in -- but then the cleverness runs on like the one-note punch line of an interminable ""Saturday Night Live sketch sponsored by Audi. And things only get worse when Borte tries to humanize his characters in the third act.As the film begins the Joneses -- Steve (David Duchovny) and Kate (Demi Moore) and their oddly adult-acting teenagers Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) and Jenn (Amber Heard) -- are just moving into a twinkling McMansion in an upscale suburb. Their castle-like home comes fully loaded with everything theyll need to dazzle the neighbors (Gary Cole and Glenne Headly play an especially gullible rich couple in a stale marriage) and ultimately have them replicating the exact same product-driven lifestyle all over town. You see the Joneses are a faux family set up by a stealth marketing firm (Lauren Hutton plays the boss) whose job it is to sell sell sell. They do this by flaunting their have-it-all lives while flashing the trendiest clothing electronics makeup groceries . . . the full list of products and services knows no bounds; even their Toto toilet is cutting edge. And this of course allows a parade of brand-name placements that any film studio would clamor to green-light.Viewers are let in on the Joneses secret pretty early in the plot. And even before that you know somethings up when the entire family rushes to answer every doorbell with gleaming smiles and a unified chorus of ""Hello Clearly these people are not normal.Just how abnormal they are is revealed in due course which comes far too quickly and coincides with Borte running out of ideas. He keeps up the shilling and the in-jokes (oh look a cameo by that camera-hogging blonde from ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta) but lets the rest of his movie devolve into a generic hash of contrived comedy romance and tragedy the saddest part of which is that a way-cool high-end riding lawn mower winds up at the bottom of someones swimming pool.Bortes greatest assets are Duchovny and Moore who make a pretty likable couple even when theyre acting despicable. Duchovny in particular gives his character a less stiff more convincing sensibility that provokes some of the biggest laughs. He plays the most human guy to begin with so he fares a little better than the rest of the family when the story calls for feel-good redemption in the final minutes.Duchovny also drives the most memorable scene when he asks his fake children if theyd like to spend some real time together. He suggests they all go to the movies.""I dont get it replies one. ""What would we sell there?Hmm. Lets make a list.Janice Page can be reached at jpageglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The reason so many remakes fail is obvious Attempting to ""update"" or merely revivify an established classic or box-office hit usually results in a pale facsimile. Wouldnt it make more sense for remakes to seize on films that had a wealth of good ideas but botched their execution? To that end someone should really get around to remaking the soft-bellied satire The Joneses before its ingenious conceit of a ""family"" of viral marketers loses relevance. Given how people are already walking billboards for one brand or another the only major difference between the characters in this film and their real-life counterparts is that the latter are conscious of what theyre selling. Writer-director Derrick Borte has a dark vision of maxed-out 21st-century suburbia where advertising is not only inescapable but the essential fabric that bonds friends and family. What he lacks is follow-through. A remake of The Joneses wouldnt even have to alter the casting much. No one does smarm like David Duchovny who epitomizes the smug vanity of eternal bachelor types yet has the ability to make it seem like rakish likeability. He plays the head of The Joneses phony household but also the least-experienced salesman of the bunch. His ""wife"" played by Demi Moore keeps Duchovny and their hip good-looking teenage ""children"" (Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth) on-message as they move into a new upper-middle-class neighborhood. Their job is to push a range of products by showing them off to their new friends whether theyre the frozen appetizers that circulate at a house party or big-ticket items like a riding lawnmower a big-screen TV or a new sports car. But the pressure to sell takes its toll as does the mounting expenses of people buying beyond their means. The perverse dynamic within the fake family--the ""daughter"" (Amber Heard) unprofessionally slips into bed with daddy--gives the early scenes in The Joneses a satiric cold-bloodedness the film gradually fritters away. Borte also succeeds for a time in making the familys lifestyle seem convincingly seductive Why wouldnt potential consumers be enticed by the products and gadgets that are bringing happiness to this impossibly glamorous bunch? The inevitable breakdown on this commercial facade might have led The Joneses into more disturbing territory but Borte goes the other direction away from jagged comedy and toward well-meaning homilies.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Joneses amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Date Night The Blvd. >> The Joneses The Joneses have moved to town. Which town? It doesnt matter except that it boasts 5000 teenagers between the ages of 15-18 and an average income of 150000. The Joneses--fake husband and wife David Duchovny and Demi Moore and their fake teens Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth--are salesmen selling their awesome lives and all the awesome gadgets that make it awesome. (""If people want you theyll want what youve got"" coos Moore.) And though Duchovnys commission depends on him posturing to be the handsome doting successful man of the house Moores the boss whos got to answer to head boss Lauren Hutton who oversees spores of faux families planted amidst upper-middle class suburbs across the country. Theyre selling it all skateboards Audis lipstick golf clubs Ethan Allen dining sets track suits Stella Artois flash-frozen sushi lawn mowers with TV sets. Its a wickedly fun premise that writer-director Derrick Borte turns into sodden soap opera. The Joneses you see arent perfect. This should be a given; instead its doled out like a surprise. You can feel the film struggling to origami a story from a catalog. In a bait-and-switch writer-director Derrick Borte drops the nasty capitalist charm of his set-up and forces a romance on Duchovny and Moore thats more fake than the family portrait over their mantel. This film needs ruthlessness especially towards the two neighbors--Gary Cole and Glenne Headly two great comedic actors who specialize in wannabes--desperately trying to keep up with the fam-bots. Good salesmen would show them no pity. The Joneses weeps for them and were not buying it.

Comments The Joneses Video Rated R  93 minutes  2010 As in ""keeping up with."" When the title characters move into a gated community they appear to be a spectacularly chic and charming nuclear family (mom Demi Moore dad David Duchovny sister Amber Heard brother Ben Hollingsworth). In fact theyre a team of marketers secretly dispatched by a cutting-edge firm to show off new products to their envy-ridden neighbors. The premise of this social satire is so enjoyable you keep trying to believe it even though it makes no sense for the cost of maintaining this crew in their swank home you could buy advertising that would reach exponentially more people. Writer-director Derrick Borte brings a heavy hand to the comedy and an even heavier one to the drama as Duchovny suffers an attack of conscience and an unfortunate love for his make-believe wife. With Gary Cole Glenne Headly and Lauren Hutton as the teams hardhearted boss. By J.R.

"Hard to buy The Joneses - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 starsHard to buy The JonesesApril 15 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticSince ""The X Files"" David Duchovnys air of undentable diffidence has been his strength (to those who find him dreamy) as well as his limitation (to the others). In the social satire ""The Joneses"" Duchovny plays a salesman who at a key point when he truly deserves it is about to be slapped by a neighbor played by Glenne Headly. Its a serious moment in a film strategically stingy on serious moments and the look of anger and confusion on Headlys face just before she lets loose is potent indeed. For a few seconds an oddly toothless comedy is made to matter. Immediately after the slap however Duchovny whose character suddenly realizes the damage he has caused doesnt seem to know how to play it. Forced to adapt his ironic glide for more dramatic circumstances he merely looks put-out confused vague. First-time feature filmmaker Derrick Borte wrote and directed ""The Joneses"" as well as served as a producer. Having honed his craft doing commercials and industrials Borte here takes aim at American consumerism and gullibility. The Joneses are a pretend family -- pretend husband and wife with two fake teenage children -- who work as a four-person sales force setting up shop in a new neighborhood. Once settled they go to work which means enticing their new neighbors and country-club friends into wanting what they have and then buying it themselves. Golf clubs imported beer flash-frozen sushi Their job is product placement and they themselves attractive and shiny are the products. Borte seems to have gotten sidetracked by the notion of audience empathy which kills satire quicker than anything. In ""The Joneses"" the characters played by Duchovny (the newbie) and Demi Moore (the sharklike veteran) dance a little dance of seduction with each other while they stealth-market themselves and all their fabulous possessions to the boorish locals. (Gary Cole plays one of Duchovnys golfing buddies married to the cosmetics-mad woman portrayed by Headly.) The cons should leave the audience a little breathless; instead Borte goes for an indistinct tone and suburban-malaise vibe that was dated (as well as patronizing) when ""American Beauty"" came out. Duchovny and Moore have their moments; theyre like two preening sharks working on commission. But without strong material their shared self-regard threatens at times to turn the movie into a two-person narcissists convention. mjphillipstribune.com 2 stars MPAA rating R (for language some sexual content teen drinking and drug use)Cast David Duchovny (Steve); Demi Moore (Kate); Amber Heard (Jenn); Ben Hollingsworth (Mick); Gary Cole (Larry); Glenne Headly (Summer); Lauren Hutton (KC)Credits Written and directed by Derrick Borte; produced by Doug Mankoff Andrew Spaulding Borte and Kristi Zea.

The subject matter is simple enough Borte has elected to highlight modern societys materialistic and status obsessions while at the same time postulating how out-of-control marketing campaigns have become. In a sense consumers have become like children - see something want something. Credit card debt is out of control because people cant restrain their buying impulses. However despite a brilliantly cynical premise and a delicious start the film eventually wilts like a lily left out in the noonday heat. Like too many satires that start out with santoku-sharp edges the blade dulls because the filmmakers dont hone it as the third act approaches. A desire to be likeable and perhaps appealing to mainstream audiences causes The Joneses to fade before eventually imploding. The biggest gaffe a late-inning sermon delivered by David Duchovny. The problem has less to do with his preaching ability than with the recognition that the message would be better left unsaid. Is Borte so uncertain of his skill that he has to spell out everything letter-by-letter? Whatever happened to subtlety? At first glance the Joneses appear to be a perfect family father Steve (David Duchovny) mother Kate (Demi Moore) son Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) and daughter Jenn (Amber Heard). But since this is a movie theres no such thing as a ""perfect family"" and despite the beautiful house the expensive furniture and the luxury cars there are issues in this paradise as becomes apparent when Jenn tries to slip into Dads bed one night. It turns out these four are actually employees of a corporation called LifeImage and have been seeded into this neighborhood to show off the good life to their neighbors and get them to buy the products LifeImage represents. The couple next door Larry (Gary Cole) and Summer (Glenne Headly) fall for it hook line and sinker - but theres an issue. Larry doesnt make enough money to finance all the purchases and he soon finds himself drowning in debt - not exactly a unique situation in modern-day American society. Im a little uneasy about the films message regarding corporate amorality and greed. Its not that I dont think corporations sometimes cross lines in their marketing campaigns but personal responsibility has to come into it and thats not something the film addresses. Blaming escalating personal debt on corporate practices is offering a scapegoat for a lack of fiscal restraint. According to The Joneses when people get in over their heads in debt its because of a companys selling practices not because of a lack of self-control on the part of consumers who should be watching their bottom line. These arent high school students caving in to peer pressure. Yes the issue of ""keeping up with the Joneses"" is a problem in modern day America but to put all the blame on the people marketing and selling the products is to overlook a major part of the issue. That being said the manner in which the film begins and the way it gradually reveals the truth about its protagonists is smart and savvy and the satire of marketing is on-target more often than not. Whats being postulated by this film isnt far from reality. Is it that much different to use product placement in movies and television shows than it is to use a real-life variation of the same thing? (In what I assume is an example of in-your-face irony Borte uses a fair share of such placements in this movie the most obvious of which is for a car I wont name here.) Solid performances from David Duchovny (in a cleaned-up version of his Californication character) Demi Moore (defying age) Ben Hollingsworth and Amber Heard cant save the movie when the screenplay goes as limp as a noodle and turns into a long string of clichA(c)s. Its sad really because the movie begins with so much promise. It has its share of amusing moments but in the end The Joneses feels like a satire that never blossoms because of a fear of becoming too dark. Its a missed opportunity that will have The Joneses struggling to keep up with its mid-April multiplex competition.

Thats good for the Joneses; theyre stealth marketers. David Duchovny and Demi Moore are well accessorized as display-model husband and wife.

David Duchovny Demi Moore Amber Heard and Ben Hollingsworth are the client-sponsored grifters; they bait their prey with the latest and greatest gadgets. But sadly the audience is conned most of all. What plays hard and dark for the films first half goes squishy and blindingly bright as calamity and then outright tragedy lead to the saw-it-coming resolution writer-director Derrick Borte thinks is more sincere than it actually plays. Duchovny is alternately (and suitably) confident and befuddled as the ex-car salesman newly hired to play ""Dad""; Moore as the boss of the crew out to make numbers and not friends is as icy as the Pomtinis shes pushing on commission; and the ""kids"" one closeted gay and one slutty arent dopes. But for whatever reason the movie goes soft Business turns to pleasure turns to hurt and the moral of the story becomes the story shrug. Still theres Gary Cole as the next-door neighbor who buys the sales pitch he cant afford. Thats recommendation enough.
