A waste of the considerable appeal and comic talents of leads Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore this barrage of demolition humor scores only a modest laugh count. The star pairing should provide Miramax with opening muscle longer-term prospects look less promising. This review was updated on September 23. Theres a direct line connecting Danny DeVitos first stint behind the camera ""Throw Momma From the Train"" to his most recent ""Duplex"" Both films center on the desired elimination of troublesome old women. But somewhere along the way the comedy turned from dark and playful to mean-spirited and sophomoric. A waste of the considerable appeal and comic talents of leads Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore -- who as producers have only themselves to blame -- this numbing barrage of demolition humor scores only a modest laugh count. The star pairing should provide Miramax with some opening muscle but longer-term prospects look less promising. While its not as callous and misanthropic as DeVitos last turn at directing ""Death to Smoochy"" theres something sour about this comedy scripted by Larry Doyle. Predictable save for a semi-clever final twist the film strains to find amusement in the discomfort of its characters and the destruction of their property. Opening animated sequence depicts young marrieds Alex (Stiller) and Nancy (Barrymore) as they brave the hostile Manhattan real estate market. Their prayers appear to have been answered when their persuasive realtor (Harvey Fierstein) shows them a spacious Brooklyn brownstone. The sole drawback is Mrs. Connelly (Eileen Essell) a seemingly benign elderly Irishwoman living in the rent-controlled apartment upstairs whose poor health indicates her lease is about to expire. But when Alex and Nancy take up residence they find that the frail oldster is full of pep. With her television blaring all night brass band rehearsals during the day and regular calls for help with chores and errands Mrs. Connelly proves hard to ignore. Seemingly sweet yet subtly demanding and manipulative she deprives the young couple of sleep and makes it impossible for Alex to complete his second novel despite an editor (Swoosie Kurtz) with a rigid deadline. As soft solutions and neighborly reasoning fail Alex and Nancy become increasingly ruthless in their bid to expel the intrusive tenant. They encounter opposition not only in the crafty old bird but in a neighborhood cop (Robert Wisdom) convinced the couple are abusive perverts. When their elaborate attempts at sabotage backfire Alex and Nancy decide to call in a professional hit man (James Remar). But Mrs. Connelly proves more resourceful than they expected. No joke is too lowbrow or tired for Doyles script from fart and vomit gags to double entendres built around diminutives of Richard (the name of Mrs. Connellys late husband and her pet parrot) to an embarrassing scatological rant from Alex in a restaurant. On top of this is a steady stream of that tired old staple spunky-granny humor. Nonetheless there are occasional moments of sharply executed physical comedy and fine chemistry between the leads. Stiller Barrymore and British stage-TV vet Essell all are likeable performers and make valiant attempts to keep the energy level aloft. Production designer Robin Standefer art director Mario Ventenilla and their team create a richly detailed environment for all the cartoonish chaos in the duplexs heavy wood-paneled interiors and the cluttered rooms of Mrs. Connellys flat. David Newmans plucky string-heavy score adds a lively comic flavor -- a flavor unfortunately missing in the writing.

She went on to become the worlds oldest woman and died aged 122 - a year after the lawyers own death. Seeing some mileage in this true story Larry Doyle has written a rom-com about a young couple who buy a duplex with a little old lady living upstairs. Novelist Alex (Stiller) and his magazine editor wife Nancy (Barrymore) hadnt figured on Mrs Connelly (Essel) a demanding deaf when it suits member of a brass ensemble. Shell surely drive them crazy - unless of course she meets with an unfortunate accident. The material is capably handled by director DeVito and lifted by Stiller a dab hand at physical comedy who also exhibits some onscreen chemistry with Barrymore. Essels sweetnsour old dear is well pitched and would not have been out of place in an Ealing comedy. The story flags a little at the close but watch out for James Remar the contract killer posing as a pornographer.

"Gentrification is hell in Duplex. Slate Sign In Sign Up Gentrification is hell in Duplex. Gentrification is hell in Duplex. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 26 2003 438 PM The Woman Upstairs An old crone torments her neighbors in Duplex. By David Edelstein Too close for comfort Its a funny coincidence that Under the Tuscan Sun and Duplex (Miramax) are coming out on the same day Theyre both about real-estate dreams (and nightmares) and they both get under the skin of people like me who have no appetite for pornography but an active fantasy life involving the real-estate pages of the New York Times Magazine. The opening of Duplex is a herky-jerky cartoon narrated by Danny DeVito (who also directed) It lays out the plight of a young middle-class couple struggling novelist Alex (Ben Stiller) and glossy-mag editor Nancy (Drew Barrymore) who enjoy city life but have neither the desire nor the money to raise a family in Manhattan. Along with many others they find the Promised Land across the Brooklyn Bridge in the lovely neighborhood of late-19th-century brownstones designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Park Slope. Or as I like to call it home sweet home. (I gravitate to neighborhoods declared by one or another of the Hamill brothers as having been ruined by an influx of yuppies.) Advertisement The movie got me where I live but I think that even non-Park Slope real-estate owners will have a blast at Duplex Its one of the most unnerving slapstick extravaganzas Ive ever seen. Alex and Nancy find a spacious brownstone a paradise of fireplaces dark wood and stained-glass windows on a tree-lined block near the park--perfect for raising kids perfect for writing reading cooking making love on the thick throw-rug in front of the fire. ... All together Ahhhhhhhh. There is one catch though their upstairs rent-controlled tenant Mrs. Connelly (Eileen Essell) a very old Irishwoman whose television blares all night over the couples bedroom who imposes on them incessantly and who comes to assume a demonic importance in their lives and careers. I groaned when I first heard this premise which sounded like a slapstick version of the dimwitted tenant-from-hell thriller Pacific Heights (1990)--smug yucks for the landlord in us all. But the movie written by former New York magazine editor and TheSimpsons writer Larry Doyle plays subtle havoc with our sympathies. Alex and Nancy are attractive likable and largely good-hearted but theyre also annoyingly entitled. He has a fat chip on his shoulder over the failure of his first novel and he seethes over the success of his buddy Coop (Justin Theroux) a best-selling mystery writer who churns out books in breezy days instead of torturous years. Nancy meanwhile fairly salivates at the prospect of getting her mitts into that upstairs space after the death of her tenant She cant help herself from snapping pictures of the old womans apartment whenever Mrs. Connelly is in another room. Its a complicated dynamic though Mrs. Connelly is one of those insinuating passive-aggressives who would drive anyone to homicide. Her demands are sweetly hesitant and then suddenly bone-freezingly pointed and shes apt to editorialize about Alexs habit of napping in the afternoons after her television has kept him awake most of the night. Shes scattershot a dodderer--until a well-aimed barb slices through the ether. You watch the 81-year-old Essell a London-based stage actress and teacher and think ""A star is born"" She has a magical non-rapport with Barrymore whos all phony smiles like a little girl pretending to be a grown-up and Stiller--an intense emotionally naked clown with the best slow burn in movies. The movie keeps psychotically raising the stakes--not a surprise if youve seen any of DeVitos other malicious comedies from Throw Momma From the Train (1987) to The War of the Roses (1989) to the recent Death to Smoochy (2002). The little imp must just love to see people driven out of their minds. I tend to find his style too whacking but his timing here (and that of his editors Lynzee Klingman and Greg Hayden) is right on the button and the scripts mixture of sympathy and satire keeps you off-guard. In the end Mrs. Connelly is more than a slapstick impediment Shes both an avaricious monster and natures revenge on our materialist dreams. Shes Freddy Krueger for gentrifiers.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Duplex is only half-goodBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY The title Duplex is far too vague and unevocative. A more apt moniker might have been The Duplex From Hell. Or Toss the Old Bat Out of the Rent-Controlled Apartment. Initially Duplex (  out of four) careens along at just the right pace. Directed by Danny De Vito who brought us Throw Momma From the Train it tells an increasingly outlandish story with very funny (and often gross) moments. But about an hour in it grows derivative and disappointing. (Related item Watch a clip from Duplex) Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore play a newly married couple who buy what looks like a dream house. With stained-glass windows three fireplaces and an antique spiral staircase the brownstone has charm and elegance to spare. Living upstairs (for 88 a month) is Mrs. Connelly (Eileen Essel) the widow of a seafaring man whom she refers to as ""Big Dick."" Nowadays she amuses herself by clumping along with Riverdance blasting away in a brass band with other ancient ladies and keeping company with Little Dick her macaw. Shes not just eccentric. She becomes a full-time job for Stiller who is trying to finish his second novel on deadline. She insists he come with her to the store where she counts grapes blueberries and individual pills. Her plumbing is always going awry and hes compelled to fix it. And after a long day of catering to her every request hes kept awake by her blaring TV. Essels comic timing is on target and shes willing to undertake a wide range of disgusting antics. Stillers character is reminiscent of his innocently eager suitor in Meet the Parents a role he plays well. But Barrymore usually an actress with a quirky verve and infectious spirit is strangely subdued. As the couples desperation grows the humor wanes. Seeing an old lady lying on her apartment floor surrounded by flames is not very amusing nor is watching a flu-ridden Barrymore vomit on her hubby.

By Moira Macdonald       Seattle Times movie critic In Danny DeVitos black comedy ""Duplex"" Ben Stiller plays a writer working on his second novel; his first novel which we glimpse briefly is titled ""Crying in the Sprinkler."" Oh now Ive gone and done it Ive told you the only remotely funny thing about this movie. Now you can take those 89 minutes and go see a good movie or go out and kick autumn leaves around the yard or sit comfortably in your living room pondering why smart people make moronic movies. No matter how you spend those precious minutes you will undoubtedly have a better time than at ""Duplex"" unless you are the sort who finds the idea of Drew Barrymore vomiting on Stillers face aesthetically thrilling. Hopes must have been high at some point for this movie Stillers sardonic wit and Barrymores squeaky charm seemed like a good match. But Larry Doyles screenplay takes one joke -- yuppie couple is so exasperated by their little-old-lady upstairs tenant that they eventually plot her demise -- and well thats all there is despite lashings of gross-out humor ""Riverdance"" spoofs and an old-lady striptease. Movie review  ""Duplex"" with Ben Stiller Drew Barrymore Eileen Essell Harvey Fierstein Justin Theroux James Remar. Directed by Danny DeVito from a screenplay by Larry Doyle. 89 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content language and some violence. Several theaters. DeVito clearly intended to take this film in the direction of his far better 1989 divorce comedy ""The War of the Roses"" in which recognizable behavior slowly is transformed to over-the-top satire. But in ""Duplex"" you dont see the transformation because Alex (Stiller) and Nancy (Barrymore) are never recognizably real; just faceless perked-up New York yuppies with as much distinction as a crumpled Starbucks cup. Harvey Fierstein in a too-brief appearance as a real-estate agent tries to wheeze some life into the movie and Eileen Essel rheumy of eye and snowy of hair has a wicked gleam in her eye as the tyrannical Mrs. Connelly. But otherwise ""Duplex"" has a faint reek of slice-and-dice desperation as if everyone involved realized too late that theyd hitched themselves to a turkey. Crying in the sprinkler or crying at the movie exit? You decide.

Starring Ben Stiller Drew Barrymore Eileen Essel. Directed by Danny DeVito. Written by Larry Doyle. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Good comedy comes not so much from the jokes as from the delivery. The urban-nightmare comedy ""Duplex"" stays funny despite rickety gags because Ben Stiller and 81-year-old Eileen Essel are old pros at playing it straight. Stiller taps the anxious-guy persona from ""Meet the Parents"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" to great effect here. He plays writer and new homeowner Alex besieged by the demands of Essels Mrs. Connelly the elderly Irish lady ensconced upstairs by rent control (88 a month to be exact). But Stiller lets his characters worry seep through even before the battle royale starts going rigid when wife Nancy (Drew Barrymore) spends too much money on a throw rug. Essel a British actress just now getting juicy parts offers a counterpoint to Stillers open book by revealing nothing. She maintains her characters kindly demeanor rebuffing Alex and Nancys offer of a bottle of wine with a smiling ""Drinking is a sin."" Essel resists the urge to mug as the movies comedy grows broader and nastier. Only the camera mugs in ""Duplex."" Director Danny DeVito (""The War of the Roses"") shoots characters from below and uses extreme close-ups to heighten a sense of impending calamity. The walls -- and the couples dream of a happy existence -- start crumbling soon after they move into their gorgeous Brooklyn duplex and discover that their upstairs neighbor enjoys television at eardrum- shattering decibel levels. Mrs. Connelly wages a war of attrition by pestering Alex into doing her dirty work like removing a rotting trash heap or taking her to the grocery store where she counts individual grapes before bagging them. The grocery- store setup isnt funny by itself but the concentration on Essels face contrasted with Stillers pained expression delivers a decent laugh. ""Duplex"" flirts with offensiveness by making Mrs. Connellys age the source of jokes. In one scene Alex hides horrified in her bathroom as she undresses -- its a tired gag used most recently in ""Big Mommas House."" But the picture never really crosses the line because Essels performance and Larry Doyles script remind us that the senior citizen always has the edge on the kids. Mrs. Connellys motivation in trying to run off the couple becomes clear only at the movies silly ending but it hardly matters. The fun is in the battle. Besides displays of yuppie entitlement earn more disdain than Mrs. Connellys bad behavior. Eyeing the upstairs space for themselves Alex and Nancy think nothing of entering the apartment without asking to show their friends. Barrymore is especially adept at breezy covetousness. Her character is convinced that good things will come to her because shes gracious and well- dressed. When Alex and Nancy have the gall to ask their tenant to move out the scene escalates from Mrs. Connelly squeeze-testing a box of chocolates to assault charges with five minutes of sublime comedy in between. The couple represents the 2003 version of Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas Roses (Alexs last name is Rose) softened and therapized out of their 1980s ruthlessness. They dont turn on each other because theyre too invested in being good people or at least in maintaining that appearance. When Alex complains to his wife about their neighbors demands she advises him ""You need to set some boundaries"" -- as if crafty octogenarian Mrs. Connelly will respond to Dr. Phil tactics. The need to be decent proves the couples biggest weakness. Terrorized and exhausted Alex finally refuses to help Mrs. Connelly with her errands but relents after she appeals to his writers vanity. Then the camera zeroes in to reveal her ruse. The moment is pure twisted DeVito whose finest work promotes the adage that no good deed will go unpunished.- This film contains violence raw language.

You know the roof leaks when Barrymore vomits on Stillers face in a joke involving plumbing repair. You know the architects started out with higher hopes when Wallace Shawn Swoosie Kurtz and Harvey Fierstein make cameo appearances. (Eileen Essell plays the unbudgeable old lady.) What looks good in the blueprint - both DeVito and Stiller specialize in the ways of ruthless people - runs into construction problems maybe from too many foremen. DeVito favors pushy slapstick; Stiller prefers hotshot sarcasm. Barrymores comic talents are wasted; shes there for decoration.
