The name is so ridiculous that it has to be based on a novel and it is - Ann Brashares best-seller in fact. Like the inoffensive book this wholesome drama weaves its uncertain sometimes charming way through the lives of four 16-year-old friends spending their first summer apart in locations as diverse as the Greek islands and Washington DC. As they keep their oath to send the jeans on to each other after a weeks wear they also share their boyfriend and family troubles via letters. The film fails to explore the implied mystical quality of the jeans (one size mysteriously fits all) but its generally harmless coming-of-age stuff - thanks in no small part to talented young actresses Amber Tamblyn and Jenna Boyd. Still the films pat moralism remains as alienatingly American as its title.

"In Traveling Pants One Sigh Fits All washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies In Traveling Pants One Sigh Fits All From left America Ferrera Amber Tamblyn Alexis Bledel and Blake Lively play best friends who share stories and jeans during a summer apart. (By Diyah Pera -- Warner Bros. Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Scott Moore Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday June 1 2005 ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is supposed to be a teenage chick flick but I have to confess that at the emotional high point a tear formed in the eye of this middle-aged man (who of course wiped it away before anyone else could notice). The poignancy seems as unlikely as the story line Four young women decide to take turns wearing the same thrift store jeans over the summer. That their vastly different dimensions would be able to fit into the same pair stretches the laws of fashion as well as credulity. It also seems unlikely that such different girls would be fast friends -- were told theyve been together since their mothers met in a prenatal aerobics class. Ah but its magic. Viewers who put aside their skepticism will be rewarded as the girls embark on their first summer apart Carmen (America Ferrera) a full-figured and volatile Puerto Rican plans to spend some quality time with her father who has moved to another state after divorce. Confident blond and athletic Bridget (Blake Lively) is heading for a soccer camp in Mexico. Soft-spoken artistic Lena (Alexis Bledel of ""Gilmore Girls"") is visiting her grandparents in Greece. Sarcastic and rebellious Tibby (Amber Tamblyn of ""Joan of Arcadia"") is remaining in Bethesda stocking shelves at a discount store and working on a cynical documentary. Though the characters seem easily identifiable types they prove to be more fully realized. That will come as no surprise to the legions of teenage girls who have devoured Ann Brasharess best-selling debut novel and its two sequels. Like Judy Blume Brashares has captured the voices of young women who are as likely to share their innermost secrets and dreams as they are to share a pair of bluejeans. Of course there are rules. But suffice to say that each girl agrees to wear the pants for a week before passing them on to the next and in turn document the luck the pants bring. But like all best-laid plans -- and well-loved jeans -- some things start to fall apart. Carmens fairy tale reunion with her dad (Bradley Whitford as socially clueless as his ""West Wing"" character) is derailed; it turns out he has a new family. Bridget is determined to perfect her ability to score on and off the soccer field though thankfully for squeamish dads much of the latter is left off camera. Lena is torn between devotion to family and her interest in a young Greek hunk. And Tibbys negativity is worn away by a precocious pest (Jenna Boyd) who sees beneath her crusty facade. The emotional story and fine acting are enough to make this a must-see movie for teen girls. The real surprise is that they can make a grown man cry. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (119 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some sensuality and language.

But unlike many of its more mature counterparts it is emotionally affecting avoiding the manipulation and formulaic camaraderie that often spoil the genre. Traveling pants America Ferrera left and Amber Tamblyn share a magical pair of jeans with two other girls. Warner Bros. Yes there are a couple of tear-jerker moments but theyre handled deftly emerging naturally from an absorbing story and sympathetic portrayals. The movie based on Ann Brashares best-selling novel is anchored by the strong performances of the four ""sisters"" 16-year-old lifelong friends spending their first summer apart. They are Carmen (America Ferrera) a vivacious aspiring writer grappling with her dads remarriage; Lena (Alexis Bledel) the shy beauty who overcomes her reserve and falls in love while vacationing in Greece; Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) the free-spirited budding filmmaker who hides her feelings behind sarcasm; and Bridget (Blake Lively) the striking blond athlete who buries her grief over her mothers suicide with cockiness and aggressive overtures toward an older guy. Shopping at a thrift store the girls stumble on a pair of Levis that fits each of their body types to a T. These ""magic"" jeans travel between Greece Mexico North Carolina and Maryland spending a week in each girls care. The movie remains fairly faithful to the book. Only one story -- Lenas Greek romance -- is altered and made more conventional. Director Ken Kwapis achieves a successful balance between high-spirited moments and more touching scenes managing to avoid mawkishness. The four actresses have the chemistry to help us believe their bond of friendship. Some of the love interests are not sufficiently developed to be convincing coming across more as handsome hunks than real guys. Some dialogue feels forced and unlikely in the subplot about Bailey (Jenna Boyd) a plucky little girl stricken with leukemia who befriends Tibby. Ferrera has the most poignant scene. Through sobs she calls her distant father (Bradley Whitford) and pours out her pain and sense of abandonment. Her heart-wrenching performance will likely move the most stoical viewer. Its heartening to see a movie about teenage girls that is concerned with serious questions and avoids the pettiness that filmmakers tend to ascribe to young women of that age. This Sisterhood has more substance than the airheads in Mean Girls and is a lot more engaging than the Ya-Yas. (PG for thematic elements some sensuality and language. Running time 1 hour 53 minutes.

""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" based on Ann Brashares popular novel takes us on a sweet-natured journey not to a galaxy far far away but to someplace just as mysterious the first tentative steps toward adulthood taken here by four teenage girls. And if the movie is occasionally a tad overdramatic -- well show me a teenage girl who isnt. Bridget (Blake Lively) Lena (Alexis Bledel who looks like a pint-sized Helena Bonham Carter) Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) and Carmen (America Ferrera) are four teenage pals bound by a lifelong friendship (their moms met in a prenatal class) and a pair of jeans. Bought in a thrift shop these pants magically fit the girls four very different physiques. (""Theres more going on here than Lycra"" one of the girls sagely observes. ""Theres definitely Lycra though"" murmurs another.) The four agree to share the pants over the summer as they scatter to distant cities and to share their adventures while wearing them. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" with Amber Tamblyn America Ferrera Blake Lively Alexis Bledel Bradley Whitford Mike Vogel Jenna Boyd. Directed by Ken Kwapis from a screenplay by Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler based on the novel by Ann Brashares. 119 minutes. Rated PG for thematic elements some sensuality and language. Several theaters. Lena a quiet artist travels to a picture-perfect Greek town for the summer and stumbles into a Romeo-and-Juliet-in-jeans situation when she falls for a boy who belongs to the wrong family. (""You must never see this boy again"" thunders her grandmother.) Athletic 17-year-old Bridget spends the summer at soccer camp in Mexico setting her sights on a handsome college-age coach (Mike Vogel) and tossing her supermodel hair around a lot. Bridgets subplot as in the book is the most adult she vows to seduce the hot coach and does so. This however is handled so discreetly (and mostly off-camera) that young viewers may well conclude that she just kissed him. Carmen the articulate writer-to-be goes to visit her divorced father in South Carolina and discovers to her horror that he has a surprise second family. And Tibby supposedly the rebel (which in this wholesome movie translates to a discreet blue streak in her hair) stays home working at the local discount store crafting a documentary film and making friends with a toogood-for-this-world 12-year-old named Bailey (Jenna Boyd). This is a lot of plot for one movie but director Ken Kwapis keeps things moving and the screenplay (by Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler) gives each girl an equal time in the spotlight. Though we rarely see them together the four create a believable giggly bond. Among them Ferrera (""Real Women Have Curves"") is a standout bringing a touching honesty to her more emotional scenes. During the films final half-hour (which features enough tears to float that cute Greek boys boat) those of us well beyond traveling-pants age might become a tad restless. But for the most part ""The Sisterhood"" is a charmer celebrating the magic of friendship and possibility -- not to mention the miracle of Lycra.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants Diyah Pera) B+ The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants Genre Drama Comedy; Starring Alexis Bledel America Ferrera Blake Lively Amber Tamblyn Nancy Travis Bradley Whitford; Director Ken Kwapis; Author Elizabeth Chandler Delia Ephron; Release Date Wide 06/03/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 115; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 1 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT Rule No. 1 when discussing The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants Its okay for a grown movie critic to admit she cried freely and with great feeling for more than half the movie and grinned like a dork through the remainder. The sob-smiles flowed as 16-year-old Best Friends Forever Bridget (Blake Lively) Carmen (America Ferrera) Lena (Alexis Bledel) and Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) spend their first summer apart from one another dealing with everything thats alternately thrilling (love) and seriously not fair (death) about life. Binding the quartet together is a magical pair of jeans passed from friend to friend that fits perfectly (also not fair) over their four very different-size butts. Rule No. 2 Its okay to use tears and smiles honestly evoked as a measure of Pants warmth and effectiveness. Ann Brashares super-selling young-adult novel became a hit because although not every woman feels like a member of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood or the First Wives Club or the Joy Luck Club or is Waiting to Exhale or Trying to Get Her Groove Back every woman has at one time been 16 years old. TV-honed director Ken Kwapis (Malcolm in the Middle) knows this and moves the action along with the same easy frequent jumps between adventures that Brashares conjures on the page. Rule No. 3 Its okay that the screenplay by femme-flick pros Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler diverges from the book because the tone remains true to the seat of the Pants. Rule No. 4 The more roles that go to the fresh charming untabloidy Pants cast the better. (That Tamblyn and Bledel happen to have TV identities as Joan of Arcadia and a Gilmore Girl is just...a bonus.) And as a subset of this rule Ferrera the great young star of Real Women Have Curves can branch out whenever she likes. But the longer she goes on representing the interests of Hispanic Americans with such flair and speaking out for young women who are totally at home in their full flesh the greater the opportunity for women of all colors and sizes to see beauty on screen that looks like theirs. Ours. Rule No. 5 Anyone who books a trip to the Greek island of Santorini after watching Lena bud and blossom with a first beau in the Mediterranean sun must confess in writing that it was The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants that did the selling.

Starring Amber Tamblyn America Ferrera Alexis Bledel Blake Lively and Bradley Whitford. Directed by Ken Kwapis.(PG. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Remarkably for a movie geared to teenage girls -- a market Hollywood typically panders to with glossy imitations of their lives -- ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" has no glaringly false moments. But there is one thats a bit of a stretch. Four close friends vibrantly played by Amber Tamblyn America Ferrera Alexis Bledel and Blake Lively try on a pair of secondhand jeans. Although their heights and weights vary the pants fit each girl like Cinderellas glass slipper. How this could be is never explained; its simply taken as an article of faith. The blue jeans become a talisman passed from pal to pal during their eventful first summer apart. This whiff of fairy tale contributed to the enormous popularity of Ann Brashares novel adapted for the screen by pros Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler. Using female writers who still remember what it was like to be on the cusp of womanhood adds immeasurably to ""Sisterhoods"" veracity. They capture the intense bonding that teenage girls have a gift for -- calling your three best friends to breathlessly report every detail of your day; talking comfortably about sex even when youre spreading misinformation; being there 24/7 for one another. To the movies credit not everyone spends her summer vacation panting over a boy. The fleeting sexual encounters have been sanitized to qualify for a PG rating so young fans of the book can readily get into theaters. Romance plays no role in the strongest segment involving Carmen (Ferrera last seen in ""Real Women Have Curves"") who goes East to visit her dad (""The West Wings"" Bradley Whitford). Hes become a peripheral figure since her parents divorced. Unlike ""Monster-in-Law"" ""Sisterhood"" isnt afraid to raise the race issue. Carmens mother is Puerto Rican her father Caucasian and Carmen sees his new relationship with a perfect blonde as a rejection not just of her but also of her ethnicity. For such a young actress Ferrera is extraordinarily adept at expressing emotions and she pulls out all the stops when Carmen tearfully confronts Dad with her fears. Director Ken Kwapis displays a good sense of how long to linger with one heroine and when its time to segue to the next. He jumps back and forth among their stories none of them strong enough to carry a full movie. Woven together however theres ample material. The tip-off that ""Sisterhood"" is moving on is a scene of the pants being packed up and shipped to another location. The most exotic are a Greek island where Lena (Bledel of ""Gilmore Girls"" fame) is meeting a host of relatives and a Mexican soccer camp where Bridget (Lively making a lively screen debut) is acting out a delayed reaction to her mothers suicide. The jeans least exotic destination is back in their hometown where Tibby (Tamblyn star of ""Joan of Arcadia"" until the series was axed a few weeks ago) is stacking shelves at a Wal-Mart-like emporium to earn money to make documentaries. But her summer is hardly dull. A young girl dying of leukemia attaches herself to Tibby ensuring more histrionics in a film already packed with them. An argument could be made that too many bad things happen to the good members of this sisterhood. The movie does occasionally teeter on the brink of soap opera but then so does life.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post For those not acquainted with Ann Brashares best-selling young-adult novel ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" and the teen fandom swirling around it Carmen Tibby Lena and Bridget are best friends. This is no small matter. The young women now in high school were destined for lifelong friendship when their mothers met at an aerobics class for pregnant women in Bethesda Md. As the big-screen adaptation of the novel opens the quartet is about to spend their first summer apart. Narrator Carmen (America Ferrera) will head off to South Carolina for a much craved reunion with her father. Her parents (played by Rachel Ticotin and Bradley Whitford) split when she was young. Winsome athlete Bridget (Blake Lively) leaves for a soccer camp in Mexico. Quiet beauty Lena (Alex Bledel) will pay a visit to her grandparents on the Greek island of Santorini. And cynical whip-smart Tibby played with pitch-perfect crankiness by Amber Tamblyn (""Joan of Arcadia"") has been sentenced to baby-sitting her much younger sister and working at Wallmans an all-in-one store that is a dead ringer for Wal-Mart. To take the sting out of being left behind - or to make art out of anger - Tibby plans to shoot a movie about the humdrum vibe of everyday life. A ""suckumentary"" she calls it. On one last trip to a thrift store the girls discover a pair of jeans that fits not just one of them but each of them. In honor of this miraculous find they create a ritual. Each girl will wear the pants for a week document the most exciting thing that happens to her while wearing them then shell ship them off to the next friend. Unlike the pants their adventures come with wrinkles Lena meets Kostas but her family hates his. Bridget makes moves on a boy that seem refreshingly bold but are also fueled by her mothers death. Carmen is forced by her dads cowardice to deal with his new picture-perfect family. Tibby learns life lessons from a dying child. As it turns out a harsh as well as healing magic comes with the enchanted jeans. Ten rules accompany the wearing of the pants. A couple reflect good fashion sense. But its Rule No. 4 that speaks to how frank and empowering Bashares book and this movie are about teen girls ""You may never let a boy take off the pants (although you may take them off yourself in his presence)."" Brashares book is not a ""just say no"" manifesto. Nor is it a yes yes yes celebration of teen sex. Directed by Ken Kwapis this PG film deals with Bridgets lost virginity (with Eric a college student and soccer coach) though not as explicitly as the novel does. But it honors Bridgets rush toward sensuality with a tender non-judgmental sigh. One reason Bashares novel is so sucessful is its matter-of-fact tone. There is a mix of hope and wariness innocence and certainty intensity and the faux apathy teens work so hard to perfect. To screenwriters Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandlers credit much of this authenticity makes it to the screen. But the real backbone of ""Sisterhood"" comes from the actresses playing the friends and the fifth-wheel surprise of Jenna Boyd. As Tibbys unasked-for sidekick and production assistant Boyd takes precocious Bailey from pest to gift in a heartbeat. If Boyd cant quite pull off the ""Camille""-like demands of the final act its because this youngster is so full of life. Parents be warned For all its girl-power pleasures ""Sisterhood"" travels some bumpy terrain. There are few issues the movie doesnt pick up to try on First love first lust parental abandonment class conflict depression mortality are all covered. Unlike the perfect pair of jeans the emotionally big-ticket items here arent always comfortable. In fact they hurt. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-820-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Sticking fairly close to the 2001 novel co-scenarists Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler preserve its strengths as a complex adolescent soap opera leavened by humor warmth and empathy. Prologues tone portends a more syrupy melodrama than thereafter delivered. Mercifully brief setup establishes protags as fated to be friends even before birth a bond only strengthened by such formative challenges as losing parents to divorce or death. Mildly punky Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is the cynical rebel. Lena (Alexis Bledel) is a wallflower aspiring artist. All-American blonde Bridget (Blake Lively) left alone with a distant father after her beloved mothers demise uses aggressive flirting and athleticism to dull the pain. Good-humored Carmen (America Ferrera) a budding writer and the pics narrator has learned to roll with the punches since dad left. This summer marks the first time the inseparable four will spend significant time apart. But before they scatter the girls find a pair of magic blue jeans in a store -- magic because they perfectly fit each differently sized heroine. Empowering the duds with 10 rules evoking good luck and good behavior the quartet vow theyll swap the pants long-distance until reunited. Bulk of story then intercuts between the principles on their separate summer vacations. Lena visits grandparents on a Greek isle where she meets dashing university student-cum-fisherman Kostas (Michael Rady). Unfortunately their families have a long-running feud with each other. Bridget finds her own slightly-older man in Eric (Mike Vogel) a dreamy young coach at the Baja soccer camp where shes a show-offy star player. Hes initially taken aback by her shameless pursuit then relents. This provides pic an (offscreen) ""first time"" thats cause for regret (though not excess moralizing) as Bridget realizes sex wont chase away her suppressed grief over maternal abandonment. Carmen despite moms (Rachel Ticotin) misgivings traipses off to South Carolina where shell stay with the father (Bradley Whitford) shes seen too briefly and infrequently since their divorce. But upon arrival he springs several dismaying surprises He lives with uber-perky Lydia (Nancy Travis) and her two kids and hes about to marry her. While superficial efforts are made to include Carmen she becomes all too aware that this squeaky-clean new family views her as an intruder. Nascent filmmaker Tibby is the only one still stuck at home in Bethesda Md. (as portrayed by Vancouver). She resigns herself to working at the local jumbo-store (refreshingly not used for a marketing tie-in) while spending spare time on a video ""suckumentary"" indicting the supreme lameness of everything and everyone. But her nihilism is slowly eroded by 12-year-old Bailey (Jenna Post) a gregarious pest who appoints herself Tibbys assistant while hiding a darker secret. Latter plot thread lays siege to the tear ducts in the final reel. Theres also some heavyhandedness in the way that every time wee Bailey and to an extent grownup Kostas opens their yaps a life lesson plops out. But in general ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" respects the intelligence of its audience (and lead characters) refusing to condescend or oversimplify. While there are wish-fulfillment aspects to some narrative turns tale manages overall to uplift without suggesting the road from girlhood to womanhood is -- or even should be -- easy. Parents will appreciate positive messages more firmly couched in adolescent reality than those in producer Debra Martin Chases ""Princess Diary"" films. Talented young lead thesps are spot-on though Ferreras (""Real Women Have Curves"" ""Lords of Dogtown"") vivacious naturalness makes her scenes especially winning. Adult characters are drawn in broader strokes but well cast. Gae Buckleys production design Lisa Jensons costumes and John Baileys widescreen lensing (Greece has never looked so well-scrubbed) make fine contribs in a package deftly turned in all departments. As one might expect the soundtrack relies on shoehorned pop tunes to a sometimes intrusive degree though it could have been worse. Original scribe Brashares has already sequelized ""Sisterhood"" in print twice leaving no lack of material for potential filmic follow-ups.

"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sisterhood-of-the-traveling-pants-the ) Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli I am unquestionably not a member of the target demographic for Ken Kwapis (He Said She Said) The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants but that didnt prevent me from enjoying it. Although theres plenty of manipulation to be found in this motion picture that doesnt obscure the inherent humanity of the characters and the sense of emotional honesty that underlies their circumstances. Plus the film features four strong leading performances from up-and-coming actresses who at least from the evidence presented here deserve to become stars. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants contains its share of flaws but they are not significant enough to mute my enthusiasm for it. The movie is based on the popular young adults book of the same name by Ann Brashares (who has since penned two sequels). Beloved by pre-teen and teen girls everywhere The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants has developed a loyal following that could make this film a sleeper hit - if it finds its audience (always a trick for a non-testosterone-fueled production arriving amidst all of the male-oriented summer blockbusters). Unsurprisingly (considering the nature of the source material) I am not familiar with Brashares work so I cant provide a novel-to-film comparison but what shows up on screen seems likely to find favor with its target demographic. The film begins with a magical central conceit - a pair of jeans that fits each of four best friends perfectly even though their body types are not similar. Those friends who were all born within a week of each other and have been close since birth are entering the summer between their junior and senior year in high school. Each has a different vacation on tap. Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) the most cynical of the group plans to stay home work at a local low-end department store (think Walmart) and make a ""Suckumentary"" about the kinds of losers who work and shop there. Carmen (American Ferrera) is giddy with anticipation about spending two months with her out-of-state father - until she learns that Dad has been keeping a few secrets from her. Strong-willed Bridget (Blake Lively) is off to Mexico for a soccer camp and a hot romance with one of the coaches. And shy Lena (Alexis Bledel) is taking a vacation to Greece where she like Bridget meets a guy. Before embarking upon their July and August adventures the four girls form the ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."" Their charter lists ten rules all of which must be followed. These include ""You must never wash the pants"" ""You must never pick your nose while wearing the pants"" ""You must never let a boy take off the pants (although you may take them off yourself in his presence)"" and ""You must pass the pants along to your sisters according to the specifications set down by the Sisterhood."" The last rule mandates that after having the pants for a week each ""sister"" must FedEx them to the next one on the list. As is expected with an episodic movie like this some of the stories are more interesting than others. Although Lenas has the most picturesque locales and Bridgets has the best-looking people the films more emotionally involving tales focus on Tibby and Carmen. The latters narrative involves the characters attempts to re-connect with a father who is more interested in elements of his new life than in leftovers from his old one. Meanwhile Tibbys story forces her to confront the meaning of friendship when she finds herself assisted by a 12-year old girl with a tragic secret. Two of the four endings are too pat but weaknesses associated with the conclusion dont invalidate the material that precedes them. All four of the young actresses do fine jobs. The most accomplished of the quartet Amber Tamblyn (""Joan of Arcadia"") gives the strongest performance. The moment when Tibbys cold faASSade cracks is heartbreaking. America Ferrera whose best-known previous exposure was in the independent film Real Women Have Curves has a scene that is almost as emotionally wrenching. Alexis Bledel (""The Gilmore Girls"") with her luminous eyes (which were highlighted for her small role in Robert Rodriguezs Sin City) is captivating as Lena. And newcomer Blake Lively shows the vulnerability hidden beneath Bridgets bravado. Supporting adult performers include Nancy Travis Bradley Whitford and Rachel Ticotin. Jenna Boyd has a key part as Tibbys assistant Baily. Does The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants have cross-over potential? Or to put it another way will it appeal to those who are not fans of the books? Thats debatable not because the movie isnt strong enough to win new adherents but because its unclear how many who are not members of the book-loving crowd will give it a chance. Although targeted primarily for girls in the 12-to-19-year old range theres enough truth about friendship love and life in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants to offer solid entertainment to almost anyone who gives it a chance. Its stronger than most teen girls bonding movies (like Now and Then and Foxfire) and deserves to be seen on merit not just because its lineage includes a best-selling book.
