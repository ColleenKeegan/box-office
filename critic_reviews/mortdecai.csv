"Mortdecai Laughs gone missing in caper comedy | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMortdecai Laughs gone missing in caper comedy Johnny Depp plays a questionable art dealer and down-at-the heels aristocrat in the repetitive and often unfunny art-heist caper comedy Mortdecai.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Jan. 23 2015MortdecaiStarring Johnny Depp Gwyneth Paltrow Ewan McGregor and Paul Bettany. Directed by David Koepp. 107 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 14AWith art-heist caper Mortdecai Johnny Depp tries his darnedest to start a kooky Austin Powers-like franchise with a side of bumbling Insp. Clouseau. But dash it all if it isnt a crashing bore old bean.Based on the quasi-autobiographical character created by British author Kyril Bonfiglioli Lord Charlie Mortdecai appears onscreen as a 1950s-style comic antihero with a weakness for damsels and drink. And Depp plays the type with broad relish right down to the Terry-Thomas gap in his front teeth.Article Continued BelowA questionable art dealer and down-at-the-heels aristocrat Mortdecai is having trouble paying his taxes. His cucumber-cool wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow quite charming here except for the tortured British accent) has a plan to sell one of their valuable old paintings depicting a pleasing hunting scene. Or as Mordecai calls it his ""horsey picture.""Enter MI5 Inspector Alistair Martland (Ewan McGregor) who arrives carrying a still-burning torch for Johanna from their school days and a plan. If Mortdecai helps crack an international art thievery scam involving a long-lost Goya Nazis menacing Russians and terrorists there may some financial relief in it old boy.Coming from the school of comedy that believes a weak joke gets better with endless repetition Mortdecai repeatedly bludgeons us with the same handful of gags. Chief among them are the leading mans beloved moustache which prompts a gag reflex from Johanna with every smooch and his propensity for inadvertently shooting his libidinous valet-bodyguard Jock Strapp (Paul Bettany handling his screen duties best of the lot).Jeff Goldblum is ill-used as the Los Angeles billionaire Krampf buyer of Mortdecais treasured Rolls-Royce. So too Olivia Munn who does little more than wiggle her tush and flash her assets as his ""well known nymphomaniac"" daughter.Their career sacrifice has the benefit of getting Mortdecai to L.A. where the films few funny scenes take place in the so-hip-it-hurts Standard Hotel as Mortdecai deals with the crassly disappointing ""colonies.""Director David Koepp (Premium Rush Ghost Town) puts the emphasis on the madcap but fails to slot Mortdecai into any kind of comic groove although German cinematographer Florian Hoffmeister (The Deep Blue Sea) creates a pleasing distraction by making everything (especially Paltrow and Munn) look luminous and lovely. Its a waste of time and talent and even Depp fans will be checking their watches as yet another animated airplane jets across the map in Mortdecai symbolically whisking the action to a different location for more of the same.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Jenny With the Schlock The Boy Next Door and the Depowering of J.Lo (Plus The Middling Mortdecai) << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Jenny With the Schlock The Boy Next Door and the Depowering of J.Lo (Plus The Middling Mortdecai) Universal Pictures Movies January 23 2015 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print In the privacy of my home with only my wife around to fact-check me Ive been known to refer to Jennifer Lopez as ""multi-untalented."" Obviously this isnt fair -- and not just because the ability to weather nearly 20 years of marketplace caprice is a talent in itself if not a superpower. But Lopezs professional identity has long been one of pop cultures most fascinating shell games. For a fly girl she turned out to be a pretty good actor. For an actor she was a pretty good singer. As a singer she sure can dance. This is the remaining-famous equivalent of using your Visa card to pay your Amex bill of pulling off the rate-card trick in lifes casino. Her last truly great movie came out the year Jaden Smith was born; her last truly great single was the no. 1 song in the country on 9/11. (Never forget.) And yet shes still undeniably and irrevocably a star hyperbarically dewy after all of these years outmaneuvering and outlasting the collaborators who supposedly prop her up. Wheres Ja Rule today? Where will Iggy Azalea be tomorrow? As long as there are awards telecasts in need of wattage there will always be a J.Lo and whether or not she wins anything shell always walk away with the show. As a song 2014s ""Booty"" felt almost algorithmically calculated a painstaking and desperate Pinterest board of outsourced ideas -- strike-a-pose finger-snaps off-brand ""Drunk in Love"" snake-synths irritant-of-the-moment Azalea replacing Pitbull on the remix and sounding as always like a tipsy Gwyneth Paltrow doing Jay Pharoahs Jigga. In Hype Williamss lets-get-unitarded video Lopez and Azalea form a callipygian yin-yang and then Lopez slides around in what appears to be a torrent of Astroglide. As a piece of music ""Booty"" is disposable; onstage at the end of the American Music Awards in November Lopez put it over like ""Proud Mary."" The spotlight dance The planet-size disco balls The red glittery tux jacket The salsa horns repurposed from ""Lets Get Loud"" At the end after letting an onstage booty call (from one ""Big D"") go straight to voice mail and shaking that iconic tailfeather in Americas face for five long seconds she said ""Shut it down"" and then held the ABC cameras gaze with the coldest are-you-not-entertained stare imaginable. Michael Tran/FilmMagic The striking thing about that last shot is how much she looked suddenly like a 45-year-old woman whod just done four straight minutes of hard cardio and wanted us to know it. I was indeed entertained; I also felt like I understood her enduring appeal/appealing endurance in a way I never had before. If what you value in pop is spontaneity sudden impact inspiration risk taste freestyle quicksilver and lack of fucks given youve probably already figured out that J.Lo is not singing for you. Shes a show-your-work pop star; visible effort is crucial to her brand. You cant really emulate a Bjork or a Beyonce without being born a world-beating genius but if youre willing to hustle to be about your business you could maybe be J.Lo who wasnt born with it either. Its why even as American Idol spins farther and farther away from the sun shes thrived as den mother and Glinda the Good Cop to the shows parade of spunky strivers. Dont be fooled by the metaphorical rocks kids -- shes a striver too and therefore the ideal face for a show whose eternally suspect thesis is that success accrues to those who want it the baddest. None of this really explains why Lopezs first feature film since 2013s Parker is The Boy Next Door an anemic thriller dumped into the snowy wasteland of Januarys release schedule by the frugalists at Blumhouse Productions. Shes Claire Peterson a high school English teacher whos raising her teenage son Kevin after kicking her cheating husband (John Corbett) to the curb. When hunky Noah (Ryan Guzman from Pretty Little Liars and the fourth and fifth installments of the Step Up saga) moves into the house next door to care for his ailing uncle its Kevin who befriends him first but before long Noah and Claire are bonding over their shared love of ancient Greek literature. ""Dude"" Noah says to Kevin ""you gotta read the Iliad"" then proclaims Homer ""a genius just like Shakespeare Byron Zeppelin Dylan."" Claire practically swooning replies ""Poets."" Later he brings her a copy of the Iliad from a garage sale. ""This is a first edition"" she exclaims. (Of the Iliad? Where was this garage sale the 1400s?) And wouldnt you know -- the bedroom where Claire studies the classics in stylishly cleavage-y loungewear and smart-person-in-a-movie reading glasses has a window that faces Noahs room. She watches him undress; a few scenes later hes undressing her talking in movie-poster copy (""No judgments ... no rules ... just us"") while Lopez makes little appreciative/reluctant meow-meow sex noises just like in the Iliad. Universal Pictures The director is Rob Cohen resurfacing for the first time since 2012s gallopingly dumb Alex Cross; the screenwriter is first-timer Barbara Curry whose story sacrifices psychological intrigue to preserve Claires likability (and Lopezs). Its established early on that Noah having missed some school due to the deaths of both his parents is nearly 20 which means their night of passion isnt against the law. Since Claire and her husband are separated shes only kinda-sorta breaking her marriage vows. And while hes a high school student and shes a teacher shes not his teacher at least not yet. Recall that in Fatal Attraction -- still the gold standard for movies like this -- Michael Douglass character is happily married but decides to have a weekend of gauzily backlit Adrian Lyne sex with Glenn Close because ""the opportunity was there."" Hes deeply complicit; he doesnt quite deserve what happens afterward but he doesnt not deserve it either. This movie wont risk us turning against J.Lo even for a second; by the time Noahs I-wont-be-ignored campaign escalates from Eddie Haskell-ish double entendres to harassment violence and calling Kristin Chenoweth the c-word Claire is inching toward a reconciliation with her husband turning this into a story about a nuclear family fighting off an external threat. Im not seriously going to suggest this movie would have been better at two hours than it is at 91 minutes but it leaves a lot of drama on the table by immediately making Noah into a glowering monster -- by the end of the movie hes basically a Terminator -- and Lopez a pure victim. You always have to wonder why anybody says yes to a project like this one but its a particularly strange choice on Lopezs part since shes done her best work in movies that dare to empower her. Seventeen years ago in Out of Sight Lopezs U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco beat down Isaiah Washington with a few strokes of a telescoping baton then had technically immoral sex with George Clooney a decision for which the story didnt punish her. Michael Apteds Enough from 2002 was nowhere near as good but there was real pulp satisfaction in watching Lopez master Krav Maga in order to kick her abusive husband off a balcony. Sometimes a little smartly executed dumb action is all it takes to turn a career around and put an actor back in touch with his or her strengths; Im guessing Lopez wont ever risk her brand by working with Lars von Trier but cant someone write this woman her own John Wick?  Lionsgate A few weeks ago The Interview brought us to the brink of all-out cyberwar with North Korea; if Englands hacker community has any national pride we should brace for a digital 1812 because Johnny Depps performance as an upper-crust twit in Mortdecai is Britface at its most slanderous. Hes Lord Charlie Mortdecai a gentleman art dealer and upper-class fop whos alienated the affections of his clearly long-suffering wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) by growing a stupid mustache. Hes also facing a staggering income-tax bill so when an MI5 agent (Ewan McGregor) seeks his aid in locating a purloined Goya he cant say no. In Kyril Bonfigliolis four cult-beloved Mortdecai novels Charlie and his manservant Jock are allegedly a more dissolute Wooster and Jeeves. I havent read them so I cant speculate on whether the boner-and-barf gags in screenwriter Eric Aronsons adaptation represent a betrayal of the source material or fealty to its spirit. It was Bonfiglioli who gave Jock the last name ""Strapp"" so its hard to say for sure. I suppose if you get really hammered on English gin beforehand Mortdecai will play like a wry Old World-meets-modernity comedy in the spirit of The Grand Budapest Hotel; seen straight its an utterly disposable but surprisingly dirty adult-oriented farce that will rise or fall for you based on how willing you are to watch Depp mug and mince for 106 minutes like a tribute-band Peter Sellers. Everyone else mostly stays out of his way with the great Jeff Goldblum and the increasingly tolerable Olivia Munn particularly squandered as an American billionaire and his deceitful horndog daughter. Mortdecai isnt particularly funny but its also not the Pistachio Disguisey 2015 train wreck the Internet has spent the last few months anticipating. Its brainless but its painless.

Hes an effeminate dandy with an absurd handlebar mustache and a plummy British accent whos known worldwide as a blustering dimwit and chronic bumbler. Over-the-top yes but Depps strenuously unfunny performance turns a frivolous caper comedy into a grim death march to the closing credits. Photo Credit Lionsgate / David Appleby advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A foppish art dealer becomes embroiled in an international criminal plot. BOTTOM LINE Depps strenuously unfunny performance turns a frivolous caper comedy into a grim death march to the closing credits. CAST Johnny Depp Gwyneth Paltrow Paul Bettany LENGTH 147 Johnny Depp takes the title role in ""Mortdecai"" a caper comedy about an art dealer and part-time sleuth improbably named Lord Charlie Mortdecai. Hes an effeminate dandy with an absurd handlebar mustache and a plummy British accent whos known worldwide as a blustering dimwit and chronic bumbler. Somehow though he always manages to get results. But not in this case laughs. advertisement | advertise on newsday This oddball character created by novelist Kyril Bonfiglioli in the 1970s is clearly meant to join Depps pantheon of outsize roles from the drunken Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series to the goth-rock Comanche Tonto in ""The Lone Ranger."" Instead Depps grating bug-eyed performance in this strenuously unfunny film may go down as a kind of psychotic break in his overacting career. Both Depp and the entire film are haunted by the ghost of Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau in the ""Pink Panther"" films. The Kato role goes to Paul Bettany as Jock a thuggish manservant who bails his master out of numerous scrapes. Ewan McGregor plays Alistair Martland a strait-laced MI5 agent who reluctantly asks Mortdecais help solving a murder that involves a missing Goya. A glimmer of recognizable humanity comes from Gwyneth Paltrow as Mortdecais stern but loving wife Johanna. Directed by David Koepp (the screenwriter behind ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Spider-Man"") from a script by first-timer Eric Aronson ""Mortdecai"" feels anachronistic on several levels Its hero is a holdover from a bygone England (he calls America ""the Colonies"") while its overall tone is a throwback to 1970s action comedies like ""Foul Play"" and ""Silver Streak."" (Olivia Munn plays the quaintly sexist role of a young nymphomaniac.) The chase scenes are as creaky as the humor. MoviesJohnny Depps 12 most outrageous roles But the bulk of the blame goes to Depp who strains so hard for laughs that he almost seems to do himself damage. Mortdecais tics and grimaces are all outward projections but inside he has no heart no soul. The reason we dont laugh at this character is because we dont really know or understand him. ""Mortdecai"" is a high-dive into a swimming pool of wackiness that turns out to be empty.

And at an hour and 47 minutes there could definitely be less of Mortdecai. But its current 8% rating on Rotten Tomatoes seems a little harsh for a film this silly and harmless and intermittently amusing; its like the drunk British uncle who puts his hand on your knee at a funeral then falls over in the hedgerow. (The plot and characters are taken from a deeply crumpet-y 1973 comic novel by Kyril Bonfiglioli called Dont Point That Thing At Me.) Johnny Depp stars as Bonfigliolis Charlie Mortdecai an amoral art-dealing fop with a posh wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow hamming it up in jodhpurs) a loyal Cockney manservant Jock Strapp (Paul Bettany who deserves better) and a hefty debt in overdue back taxes. Mortdecais dire financial straights impel him to take a job tracking down a legendary Goya painting thats gone missing and possibly fallen into the hands of international terrorists. His search leads to a series of pinballing straining-madly-for-madcap scenes involving Nazi war crimes Russian thugs a shifty Los Angeles billionaire and his nymphomaniac daughter (Jeff Goldblum and Olivia Munn respectively) and a government agent (Ewan MacGregor) who is also an old rival for the affections of Johanna. The travel budget seems unlimited and the setpieces look alarmingly expensive. But mostly its all just a showcase for Depps preening prat-falling out-of-time aristocrat; hes less a character than a mincing bundle of mannerisms and secondhand David Niven-isms. (An inordinate number of gags revolve around his mustache which looks like two wet baby ferrets nuzzling before a warm fire.) The movie is too odd and randy to play for kids on an Austin Powers level and too broad to really work as farce. But Depp god bless him fully commits and finds a few genuinely funny moments amidst all the outsize mugging and mild sociopathy. Go if youre a raging Anglophile with an afternoon to burn or you just love Depp even at his hammiest. Otherwise dont point this thing at you.

Thats not a bad thing. A farcical undertaking indebted to Peter Sellers Monty Python and the Upper Class Twit school of mockery  Mortdecai (which is adapted from Kyril Bonfigliolis novels) is an exceptionally silly film about a stolen painting that triggers international reaction. A legendary Goya taken by the Nazis and said to hold the key to multimillions in their secret bank accounts vanishes from the studio of an art restorer. The art restorer is killed in the heist shot in the back with an arrow. Mortdecai is called in to get to the bottom of the robbery.  A somewhat crooked art dealer and international man of mystery Mortdecai is a chivalrous but useless dandy who goes through life in a Rolls Royce; he has a trusty manservant named Jock who is loyal and tough (Paul Bettany who is hilarious here) to help him fight his battles. If anyone might know who was looking for a stolen Goya it would be Mortdecai. Then there are Mortdecais clever wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) his old school chum Police Inspector Martland  (Ewan McGregor) the American millionaire buying Mortdecais Rolls Royce (Jeff Goldblum) and a handful of criminals strange characters and art collectors from all over the world to add to the chaos. The humour is puerile and idiotic but you may laugh out loud in spite of yourself -- especially if youre familiar with the Carry On movies or the original Pink Panther. It should be said that those puerile elements in Mortdecai mean the movie has everything an adolescent boy could ever want in a comedy a whole scene devoted to the stinkiness of a stinky cheese; erection jokes a discussion of farts spectacular vomiting sequences people with their pants down; naughty language including balls and that Paul Bettany character who is as randy as he is invincible.

Its a pity. In 1965 Mortdecai would be the hit of the year. Director David Koepp whips through this pop-colored caper about crooked art dealer Charlie Mortdecai (Johnny Depp) -- one of those posh British frauds with a large estate and no money in the bank whose existence is like a faked Rembrandt merely a good-looking scam -- as though he thinks that if the dialogue speeds fast enough the entire film can DeLorean back five decades to where it belongs. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Comedy molds quicker than other genres. A kiss or a punch might pack the same smack as the day it was filmed but a punchline soon rots. Mortdecai feels fusty from the moment it begins. The opening slapstick sequence is an exact mimic of the Chinese nightclub in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom itself a hat-tip to the past. There are vengeful Asian gangsters red and blue neon a tense exchange of valuables and a wacky fire battle that winds up broiling the bar. Whenever Depp smacks the table Koepp cues a dopey sound effect a gag that hasnt made adults chuckle since Laugh-In.If it were unearthed today as a lost spiritual sequel to The Pink Panther Mortdecai might have been hailed as a treasure. But theres no room at the modern multiplex for an homage to kooky classic comedy unless were snickering at the very idea as in the Austin Powers films. And for better and worse Koepp is sincere. He has great affection for this world of overstuffed libraries and leather chairs a place that looks like its from a Tintin comic but whose obsessions are resolutely adult. Mortdecais idea of a prank involves tricking someone into drinking cheap port.Film Details Mortdecai RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time107 min. More Info Trailer The first 10 minutes of the film are devoted to Mortdecais newly grown mustache which is literally the only topic of conversation. He preens it with a tiny comb smoothing the curls from his nose to the corners of his gummy grin. Its a rich caramel that matches his gelled hair his brown suit and the corgi he shares with wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow). She cant stand the thing. Every time she kisses him she gags causing Mortdecai to panic that Johanna will leave him for MI5 agent Martland (Ewan McGregor) whos pressuring the couple to find a missing Goya that may lead to a Swiss bank stash of Nazi gold.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm The best thing about the mustache is that it keeps Depp from wearing a fedora. He never acts without a security blanket from the costume department. In the 80s it was teardrop tattoos and scissor hands; then came two decades of hats. Next perhaps a monocle. But after a string of expensive misses Depp needs to make sure there will even be a next. His charm has calcified into caricature Hes played pirate Mad Hatter and Native American with the same extravagance. Here Mortdecai simpers like an ingenue burbles as if he has indigestion and runs in mincing steps with his hands flipped out at the wrists as if hes dancing the Charleston.The irony is that Depps shtick is ideal for the part -- its just so similar to his bad roles that we cant tell hes doing good work. The Mortdecai of the comedy novels from the 70s (themselves 10 years too late for popular success) was a cartoonish clod whod have died on page one if not for his heroic manservant Jock (Paul Bettany with a fierce facial scar). He was a snob a drunk and a frustrated lech. The latter two partially explain Mortdecais R rating but his boner jokes are so genteel that most of them will flutter right past the children who have formed the bulk of Depps fan base.The rest of the cast acts at a less obnoxious pitch allowing Bettany Paltrow and McGregor -- best known for their serious dramas -- to prove themselves surprisingly deft comedians. When McGregors agent pretends to soothe Mortdecais anxiety about his marriage he adds a lusty emphasis to the line ""Dont worry about your wife Ive been keeping her filled in."" Their performances deserve to be seen. The hard part will be convincing audiences to shake off their Depp fatigue and embrace a film thats daffy dated and precisely as intended. If we cant then the joke is on us -- a gantlet Koepp throws down in a sly silent gag when Mortdecai flits to Los Angeles and discovers to his shock a whole elevator of hipsters with retro mustaches. Were already living in Mortdecais world. We may as well laugh at it. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact Amy Nicholson Follow L.A.

The direction by David Koepp is bad the screenplay by Eric Aronson very bad -- though if Aronson were a bubbly American 15-year-old attempting a British caper-comedy after thrilling to a lot of old movies (which is how the script plays) Id tell him it wasnt too bad because puberty is difficult enough. Depp is very very bad. Watching his first scene a bad echo of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom I thought hed finally moved from emulating late (insane) Brando to late slumming Peter Sellers and would spend the rest of movie swapping out wigs and accents. It quickly became clear that his bad gap-toothed Terry-Thomas imitation (with extra eyebrow action) would be all she wrote. The badness settled over the audience like nuclear ash. Related Stories What the Hell Is Mortdecai? Critics are expected to explain the reasons for their judgments and my feeling is that Mortdecai is bad on account of its general badness. Its based on a comic novel Dont Point That Thing at Me by one Kyril Bonfiglioli a surprisingly not-bad Wodehousian pastiche I whizzed through in a couple of hours after enduring the film. Bonfigliolis hero is a mix of Bertie Wooster and Nick Charles a louche drunken ever-on-the-verge-of-insolvency aristocrat whose beauteous wife finds his lovingly curled new mustache literally nauseating. (Literally.) Theres no Jeeves so Mortdecai (the t is silent as in fox) travels the world with a scarred manservant named Jock who saves him from sundry assassins while still finding time to seduce every available (or unavailable) woman.A Reading Bonfiglioli I finally saw what Depp and Company were shooting for but nothing kills pastiche like campy overemphasis. (Others will disagree which is why drag shows remain popular but I think that nowadays camp needs to be Wildean like Charles Ludlam or punkishly confrontational like early John Waters to be more than dumb winks and nudges.) Oddly for a movie like this one of the villains is a donnish old queer who presses his erection in an elevator against the gibbering Mortdecai. Camp plus homophobia is quite the combination. Thumbing through my notes on Mortdecai I find phrases like ""bad Wes Anderson dollhouse exteriors"" and questions like ""Did Depp envy Robert Downey Jr.s success with his depressingly bad Sherlock Holmes?"" Every time Depp gave a phlegmy little stammer and jauntily uttered lines like ""I say old bean"" I wanted to bop him on the same with a rotten tangerine. The plot is something about a long-lost Goya painting on the back of which is scrawled the number of a Swiss bank account full of Nazi lucre. A Russian assassin wants that painting (or more precisely that account number) in the most murderous way which leads to bad slapstick fights (Mortdecai effuses like a sissy twit while amscraying stage right) and interchangeable chases. Whats not so bad? Mark Ronson and Geoff Zanellis 60s-ish lounge-music score which has patches that in another context would be transcendent. Mortdecais ""sympathetic gag reflex"" which guarantees two two two retches in one. Ewan McGregors crisply authoritarian entrance to a murder scene as an MI-5 inspector -- though McGregor runs out of invention. Gwyneth Paltrow who plays Mortdecais wife and is generally bad but once or twice has the blithe insouciance of Diana Riggs Emma Peel. (If Gwynnie could have learned to karate-chop shed have been better than anything in the 90s remake of The Avengers.) Above all Paul Bettany who makes the hulking Jock an endearing mix of incongruous traits. Bettany a Brit understands that a performance can be both broad and straight (i.e. non-campy) an idea that eludes many American actors who arent weaned on classic farce. Time to pull back a smidge. For all the badness in Mortdecai Ive seen many action comedies that are much much worse. Hudson Hawk is bad with bells on. Those Downey Holmes movies are bad to the bone. The aforementioned Avengers remake is Beyond the Valley of the Bad. Badness is a reliable hazard of the action-comedy genre in which campiness and bloody violence can often mix badly. And another thing Every bad performance in Mortdecai is by an actor who in other circumstances has thrilled me to pieces. Zillion-dollar screenwriter Koepp has directed entertaining films among them Stir of Echoes and the supernatural comedy Ghost Town. (I enjoyed his flop bicycle-messenger thriller Premium Rush a model B movie. So sue me.) In the end we must lay the badness of Mortdecai at the feet of its star. I envy Depps capacity for self-amusement but its a pity hes so rich and enbubbled that no one dares say to say to him ""Er Johnny ... this is er really very bad.""

I suppose casting Johnny Depp was inevitable. But ""Mortdecai"" the movie that resulted is nearly unbearable -- over 100 slow-moving minutes of Depp fluttering about and flashing a gap-toothed smile borrowed from Terry-Thomas. Well Terry-Thomas has more to smile about than anyone who sits through this. And hes been dead for 25 years. The comedy caper is based on a novel that was apparently a cultish hit in Great Britain where a mix of ""Flashman"" adventure and Jeeves-and-Wooster comedy still goes down like Pimms. Well jolly good for them. And toned down perhaps and played very dryly -- think say early `50s Ealing Studios with Dennis Price as Mortdecai and Alec Guinness as everyone else -- it might have been wonderful. But here -- with its two ex-pat Americans proudly trotting out their accents like something they just picked up at Harrods and playing everything loud and obviously -- its about as appetizing as last weeks eel pie. Depp -- who used to be at least an interesting actor remember those days? -- attacks the part with the same sort of giggly glee he probably once showed playing dress-up with grandmas Sunday best. The whole things a great laugh to him rather embarrassing to everyone else forced to watch. Gwyneth Paltrow -- who used to do more than just pose and smirk remember that? -- plays Mortdecais wife ""a damn attractive woman"" as were constantly reminded. In reality she is what other women occasionally damn with faint praise as ""well-groomed"" and about as sexy as a mannequin. About as interesting too. But then thats also the fault of the movie theyre in which has a silly plot about a stolen Goya brings in a mostly humorless Ewan McGregor as a British agent and then tries to convince us were having stylish sexy fun by throwing in lots of zooms and Olivia Munn and vulgar words and closeups of Paltrow in jodhpurs so tight they must have cut off the circulation to her brain. Paul Bettany at least seems to be having a good time. He plays Mortdecais bodyguard/butler Jock Strapp -- which should give you an idea of the level of the humor here -- and he gets the uncomplaining selfless and strangely superhuman nature of the long-suffering gentlemans gentleman just right. But Depp is unbearable (""a fugitive from a home for alcoholic music-hall artistes"" McGregor calls him at one point and its not the joke the movie thinks it is). Paltrow is nearly lifeless inside her carapace of self-regard and no one else makes much of an impression. Lucky for them I suppose. ""Dont be tiresome"" Paltrow tells Depp at one point. Or did I forget myself and yell that? Whoever it was no one in the movie seems to listen. Theyre all talking too loudly -- and oh-so-terribly-Britishly-dont-you-know -- to hear a thing. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations violence and strong language. Mortdecai (R) Lionsgate (106 min.) Mortdecai Directed by David Koepp. With Johnny Depp Gwyneth Paltrow.

(Daily Dish USA TODAY)Gwyneth Paltrow and Johnny Depp star in the comedy ""Mortdecai.""(Photo David Appleby) 76 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMOREWhenever Johnny Depp finishes his long career of playing kooky big-screen characters aristocratic idiot Charlie Mortdecai for sure wont be near the top of the greatest-hits list.With a varied wardrobe of retro mens finery and a hirsute upper lip the title character of the silly comedy Mortdecai (1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) is the center of a whirlwind of horrible British accents too much gagging not enough good gags and weak dialogue that while not exactly terrible is terribly boring.American audiences may initially be unaware but Mortdecai hails from the same English literary tradition of Sherlock Holmes and James Bond The movie by director David Koepp (who directed Depp previously in Secret Window) and screenwriter Eric Aronson is based on the first of Kyril Bonfigliolis cult novels Dont Point That Thing at Me.If only Depps mustached dude was as sharp a master detective and as suave as 007. Instead the dimwitted Mortdecai and his loyal manservant Jock (Paul Bettany) find themselves traveling from England to Russia to the ""colonies"" in order to track down a lost Goya painting with a secret worth a fortune.USA TODAYJohnny Depps Mortdecai co-star His mustacheIf anyone could use the money its Mortdecai and his wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) -- the couple rides and lives in luxury but theyre a few days from insolvency. Mortdecai owes the government roughly 8 million pounds in taxes so when Inspector Martland (Ewan McGregor) comes calling for his help in sussing out info in the shadier corners of society the art-dealing rogue is unwittingly obliged to chip in for ""Queen and country.""""I had no idea I was so deep in her majestys hole"" Mortdecai quips in one of the films many unfunny sex fart and fat jokes.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Johnny Depp plays a British spy in Mortdecai who is on a mission to save the world while his wife Johanna played by Gwyneth Paltrow sits back and wonders what he is up to. VPCOlivia Munn doesnt have a chance to show the chops she displays in The Newsroom since shes too busy being the movies main cleavage-baring sex object. The nymphomaniac daughter of a rich Los Angeles guy (Jeff Goldblum) she like a bunch of Russians an international terrorist and various other neer-do-wells is hot for the Goya.USA TODAYCan we get a smile from Johnny Depp at his Hollywood Mortdecai premiere?The one talent not wasted is Bettany playing well against type as Mortdecais loyal and oversexed bodyguard who has to constantly bear the brunt -- and the bullets -- of his boss mistakes.The violence is of the over-the-top Looney Tunes variety which is fitting since Depps Mortdecai is a clueless mash-up of Christopher Walken and Pepe Le Pew.Hes also a complete horndog though his well-manicured stache is shutting down his love game. It acts as an inadvertent chastity belt of sorts with his wife who gets the dry heaves every time they try to kiss. Her response to his bedroom moves ""It looks like you have a vagina on your face."" (Yep this ones not really for the kids -- they should probably see better movies than this anyway.)Mortdecai adores his gravity-defying lip curls though and Depp overdoes every wacky aspect of his child-like character from his constantly shifting eyes to the gap in his front teeth to his incoherent babbling. But when it comes to memorable roles his antihero couldnt wear the feather boa of Ed Wood or the dreadlocks of Jack Sparrow and the actor has done a lot better than this forgettable piece of bargain-basement low art. 76 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1JqO1zt",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/01/23/mortdecai-movie-review/22181023/,200,mortdecai10,mortdecai,usatoday

(David Appleby / Lionsgate) Gary Goldstein Crime caper Mortdecai is better than expected with the screwball stylings of Johnny Depp latimesmovies Its hard to say exactly who the audience is for the zany curio ""Mortdecai."" But those who do find their way into this supremely silly action-mystery caper are in for a few grins if not laughs thanks largely to the deft -- and daft -- performance of Johnny Depp in the title role.As goofball English aristocrat puckish bon vivant and underhanded art dealer Charlie Mortdecai Depp channels such British funnymen as Peter Sellers and Terry-Thomas (replete with the latters gap teeth) as well as Mike Myers in the ""Austin Powers"" series while still putting his own irrepressible spin on the whole madcap charade. Its limber comedic work from one of actings best-known chameleons. And if the rest of the movie directed by David Koepp (""Premium Rush"" ""Secret Window"") isnt quite as memorable as Depps screwball stylings its a mostly zippy well turned-out concoction. Translated Its better than expected.With a script by Eric Aronson based on the 1973 Kyril Bonfiglioli novel ""Dont Point That Thing at Me"" ""Mortdecai"" is set in the present but drips with a swinging 60s vibe including an enjoyably spoofy retro score. The story finds Mortdecai and his lovely far brainier wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow returning to her ""Shakespeare in Love"" accenting) facing an 8-million pound tax debt and forced to liquidate the contents of their country manor. Enter British Secret Service officer Alistair Martland (a dashing Ewan McGregor) who reluctantly hires old college frenemy Mortdecai to help recover a purloined Goya painting whose restorer was just murdered. It also puts Martland back in front of the fetching Johanna for whom the MI5 agent has long carried a torch. Scenes from the movie ""Mortdecai."" The mission leads Mortdecai his loyal and tough shag-happy manservant Jock (Paul Bettany) and later Johanna on a globe-trotting search. They go from London to Moscow to as the snobby Charlie would have it ""a terribly vulgar place called Los Angeles"" to recapture the missing masterpiece and return the Mortdecais to financial solvency. (Eye-popping whoosh-zoom graphics accompany the films many location jumps.)Scads of nutty cartoonish action and wacky scenarios ensue as Mortdecai and company try to stay one step ahead of Emil Strago (Jonny Pasvolsky) a wild-haired revolutionary who wants the Goya to finance a worldwide uprising.

Too much is made here of Mortdecais eccentric twirl of a mustache particularly how Johannas distaste for it shuts her down romantically (though the gag reflex the odd facial hair inspires is pretty funny.) Like much else in this scattershot comedy less might have been more. Fortunately enough hits its mark -- or at least comes close -- to recommend ""Mortdecai"" as a rollicking check-your-brains-at-the-door diversion.------------""Mortdecai""MPAA rating R for language sexual materialRunning time 1 hour 46 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Strange Magic casts a musical spell but as a movie it misses Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mortdecai-review-20150123-story.html#navtype=outfit,200,mortdecai11,mortdecai,latimes

Photo David Appleby/Lionsgate MOVIE REVIEW Mortdecai Ghastly affair. Running time 107 minutes. Rated R (profanity sex jokes mild violence) ""Mortdecai"" is mortdifying a mortdal sin of a movie thats headed for the cinematic mortduary. Bertie Wooster meets Austin Powers in the person of the title character an English lord played by a simpering fluttery Johnny Depp who spends the entire movie begging us to laugh at his mustache. The buffoonish Lord Charlie Mortdecai is enlisted by a copper (Ewan McGregor) with a crush on the aristos wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) to find out what happened to a stolen Goya painting. Mortdecais snarling henchman (Paul Bettany) is named Jock Strapp which is the movies idea of a naughty double entendre. ""Every man should have a Jock dont you think?"" muses Mortdecai. Told he is in debt Mortdecai says ""I had no idea I was so deep in Her Majestys hole."" Despite being set in contemporary times the film seems to hope to be mistaken for the dumbest slapstick sex farce of 1965. Its a low bar that towers over ""Mortdecai."" The only funny moment is when Mortdecai finds himself in the elevator of a cool Los Angeles hotel and every hipster who boards it is sporting facial hair as twee and unfortunate as Mortdecais lip topiary. Every time his wife sees that stache she wretches -- call it a running gag. Gwyneth Paltrow and Johnny Depp in ""Mortdecai""Photo David Appleby/Lionsgate While Depp ransacks the Jerry Lewis playbook for ideas on funny faces he (and everyone else) takes turns being shot run over or beaten. The story (taken from a novel by Kyril Bonfiglioli) skitters uncertainly from London to Moscow to LA as Mortdecai searches for the priceless painting which for extra intrigue may contain the Swiss bank account number that Hermann Goering scrawled upon it as he was being captured. Naturally. Director David Koepp evidently has such confidence in the comedy that he considers the haphazard plot to be incidental but the two elements are both so boring in their incoherence that they amplify each others stultifying effects. Amid the random plot turns the jokes sound like mistranslations of one-liners that were only vaguely funny in some other language ""I eschew discomfort"" ""Youre barking up the wrong Englishman"" ""You look like you have a vagina on your face."" ""Mortdecai"" typifies playful English wit in much the same way as Wimbledon is known for its monster truck rallies.

Daily Edition Login to download Mortdecai Film Review 1200 AM PST 1/22/2015 by Stephen Dalton FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Rhymes with mortify TWITTER Johnny Depp indulges his inner clown playing the boozy aristocratic anti-hero from a series of cult British comic novels. Any film credited with its own ""mustache wrangler"" really should have been much more fun than Johnny Depps latest misfiring action-comedy. Mostly set in contemporary England but aiming for the zingy retro feel of a vintage Peter Sellers or Terry-Thomas feature from the Swinging Sixties Mortdecai is an anachronistic mess that never succeeds in re-creating the breezy tone or snappy rhythm of the classic caper movies that it aims to pastiche. Despite a heavyweight cast and the solid directing skills of A-list screenwriter David Koepp (Jurassic Park Panic Room Spider-Man) this charmless farce ends up as another black mark on Depps recent track record of patchy pet projects. Mortdecai is based on the first in a series of irreverent comic novels by Kyril Bonfiglioli a British author of Italian and Slovenian heritage. Published in the 1970s the books chronicle the amoral antics of aristocratic British art dealer Lord Charlie Mortdecai (Depp) who is aided on his drink-sodden adventures by his thuggish but resourceful and sexually irresistible manservant Jock Strapp (Paul Bettany). Sharing some of his heros louche habits in real life Bonfiglioli battled with poverty and alcoholism dying of cirrhosis in 1985. Depp plays Mortdecai as a human Looney Tunes character a snobbish playboy narcissist so enamored of his comically absurd new moustache that he risks driving his disapproving wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) to divorce. Teetering on the brink of bankruptcy in his grand stately home the disreputable gap-toothed rogue spots a chance to escape financial ruin when a rare Goya canvas goes missing after a lethal robbery. Grudgingly recruited for his art-world expertise by suave MI5 agent and longtime love rival Alistair Martland (Ewan McGregor) Mortdecai jets off around the globe on a mission to find the stolen painting and exploit the priceless secret rumored to be hidden on its reverse side. Depp is known for channeling real role models into his characters often drawing on his musician heroes most famously Keith Richards in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. In his accent and mannerisms Charlie Mortdecai appears to owe a heavy debut to the small-screen creations of Depps friend the British TV comedian Paul Whitehouse. Depp has previously guested on Whitehouses long-running BBC sketch comedy The Fast Show and frequently offers him supporting roles in his film projects including this one. Here he plays Mortdecais colorfully foul-mouthed car mechanic who also has a shady sideline fencing stolen artworks. Mortdecai is stuffed with star names and classic farce ingredients but its fatal flaw is an almost surreal lack of jokes. The main players spend almost every scene mugging desperately for the camera milking every possible lowbrow sexual innuendo and clumsy slapstick mishap in novice screenwriter Eric Aronsons thin script. Ironically these overcooked performances are often more hindrance than help when the occasional funny line arises. While Depps fruity English accent is palatable enough McGregors smarmy approximation sounds forced and unconvincing. Only Paltrow emerges from this farrago with any real acting credit playing Johanna with straight-faced understatement while all around her are losing their heads. On the page Mortdecai and Strapp are clearly uncouth cousins of P.G. Wodehouses Jeeves and Wooster. On screen their boorish mannerisms and retro attitudes owe more to Austin Powers. But while Mike Myers found rich humor in the gap between a chauvinistic past and politically correct present much of the labored comedy in Mortdecai relies on dated stereotypes unredeemed by any hint of post-modern irony. Women are insatiable nymphomaniacs who enjoy being groped Americans vulgar materialists Brits upper-class dimwits and so on. These caricatures are too crude to be offensive but also too stale and lazy to be funny. The final set piece which takes place at an upmarket London art auction house brings all the characters and subplots together in an orgy of cartoonish violence and triple-cross deceptions that quickly becomes tiresome. For all its minor offenses against taste and decency the sole unforgivable sin that Mortdecai commits is one that would leave its rakish anti-hero aghast. Because the film that bears his name is ultimately a frightful crashing bore.

(David Appleby/lionsgate) BY Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday January 22 2015 1258 PM Title Mortdecai Film Info With Johnny Depp Gwyneth Paltrow Bumbling British bounder gets embroiled in an art-world heist. Director David Koepp (146). R Language sexuality crude humor. Area theaters. Johnny Depp has done so much for us. Let us now return the favor and pretend ""Mortdecai"" a disastrously misjudged career low never existed. Before we wipe the record clean you may wish to know what youll be dismissing. Director David Koepp and screenwriter Eric Aronson have adapted Kyril Bonfigliolis 1970s comic novels about a snobbish British aristocrat. He spends his life stumbling into and then being rescued from various mishaps. As the film begins the ever-careless Lord Mortdecai (Depp) owes the government several million pounds. To repay the debt Agent Martland (Ewan McGregor) asks him to track down a stolen Goya painting. The adventure takes him from London to Los Angeles where the work may be in the hands of a sleazy millionaire (Jeff Goldblum) and his wily daughter (Olivia Munn). Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Martland (Ewan McGregor) in Mortdecai. (Stephen Vaughan/lionsgate) Unfortunately Mortdecai is both intellectually deficient and morally bankrupt qualities the filmmakers unaccountably consider adorable. Because he believes all work to be beneath him the assignment eventually falls to his practical wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) and loyal valet Jock Strapp (Paul Bettany). If you think Jocks name is hilarious you may also appreciate the movies seemingly endless toilet and testicular jokes. (Theres also some mass projectile vomiting for good measure.) What played as amusing 40 years ago falls very flat today. Koepp mistakenly treats Mortdecais casual sexism homophobia blind privilege and obscene entitlement as delightfully charming rather than -- like the films clear precursor ""Austin Powers"" -- entertainingly clueless. Jock (Paul Bettany l.) and Charlie Mortdecai (Johnny Depp) in Mortdecai"" in which Depp achieves a career low. (David Appleby/lionsgate) Paltrow and McGregor play things straight which at the very least feels like the sanest response to the madness surrounding them. But then Depp sucks so much air out of every scene that we barely notice anyone else. His faux accented wild-eyed and insanely mannered performance makes ""Pirates of the Caribbean""s Jack Sparrow look like a model of uptight restraint. Without anything funnier to offer Koepp leans heavily on a pointless running joke about the way Mortdecais mustache continually triggers Johannas gag reflex. Should you find yourself subjected to this baffling display of wasted talent time and resources prepare to share her understandable instinct.

Johnny Depp plays the title character a hereditary peer complete with a mansion near London a manservant and a not entirely convincing Terry-Thomas accent who carries out a little art-world espionage on the side. Set on the trail of a missing Goya by policeman and love rival Martland (Ewan McGregor) Mortdecai and his prim lady wife (Gwyneth Paltrow inevitably) travel the world sipping cognac sneering at the locals and staying one step ahead of a gang of Russian thugs.Contrary to appearances Mortdecai isnt a total disaster Depp may be suffering the most catastrophic career slump since Eddie Murphy said yes to Norbit but hes still perfectly watchable. The script meanwhile offers up a small handful of decent gags and there are just enough pratfalls and wacky cameos (Paul Whitehouse Jeff Goldblum) to drag us through the boring bits. But as the plot ties itself in ever more uninteresting knots a nagging question remains who is Mortdecai for? Its not thrilling enough for the multiplex crowd and not funny enough to work as out-and-out comedy. The aristocratic in-jokes are sure to alienate US audiences while Brits will be put off by the sheer relentless fakery of it all. Its hard to escape the suspicion that the only people sure to enjoy Mortdecai are Depp Paltrow and perhaps Tim Burton and Madonna.

Should the recent surge in male facial hair as a fashion accessory stall in 2015 barbers would be within their rights to blame ""Mortdecai"" a perky but obstinately unfunny heist caper with a hero irksome enough to make any happily mustachioed man reconsider his life choices. Directed (but unusually not written) by an off-form David Koepp the film shoots for the swinging insouciance of 60s farce but this story of a caddish art dealer enlisted by MI5 to assist in a knotty theft case is longer on frippery than quippery Theres a fatal shortage of zingers to supplement its exhausting zaniness. Only particularly dedicated devotees of Johnny Depps latter-day strain of mugging -- here channeling Austin Powers by way of P.G. Wodehouse -- will delight in this expensive-looking oddity. Eric Aronsons script -- his first feature-length effort since 2001s little-cherished Lance Bass starrer ""On the Line"" -- is based on Kyril Bonfigliolis 1973 novel ""Dont Point That Thing at Me"" the first in a moderately popular comic series centered on the amoral trickster Charlie Mortdecai. Mortdecais twitchy stache was enough of a character trademark to feature in the title of the series final chapter; while it might be stretching a point to call Depps daintily upturned walrus whiskers the films best joke its certainly its hardest-working one serving as the impetus for several long-running gags. (If auds arent tickled the first time Mortdecais upper-lip rug triggers a womans gag reflex the film reasons theyll warm to the idea with repetition.) If thats not much to build a comedy on its an even flimsier basis for a character As presented here at least Mortdecai is certainly daft but not in the singularly absurd way that makes Wodehouses Bertie Wooster say a distinctly human figure of fun. Rather hes an amalgam of easy-target toff characteristics -- a preening lily-livered aristocrat of indeterminate provenance forced to live by his unreliable wits as his fortune supposedly runs dry. Not that theres any evidence of financial strain in his immaculate country pile or his equally polished trophy wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow game but under-challenged) whose plainly superior intellect hasnt yet inspired her to leave this dolt and head up a posh adventure franchise of her own. If push came to shove meanwhile it seems Mortdecai would sooner lose Johanna than his quietly hulking Cockney manservant Jock Strapp (these are the jokes people) played by a creatively if unhappily cast Paul Bettany; our man remains too self-absorbed however for any upstairs-downstairs bromance to take root. Mortdecais usual subsistence strategy of art-related con jobs -- passing off tat as treasure in much the same way he passes himself off as a gentleman -- is taken up a notch when Security Service agent Martland (Ewan McGregor) comes knocking. A former college frenemy who still carries a torch for Johanna Martland reluctantly recruits the rogue to assist in their search for a missing Goya masterwork of eye-watering value. No prizes for guessing the decoys and double-crossings that ensue as the action zooms -- literally so with bouncy 3D atlas graphics -- from London to Moscow to Los Angeles and back again with a hammy side of thickly accented heavies in tow. The outcome is neither surprising nor especially smart; Koepp whose last directorial outing ""Premium Rush"" demonstrated his occasional knack for unabashed gee-whiz silliness is more concerned with keeping the story at an active simmer. In that respect ""Mortdecai"" succeeds; even at its emptiest its hardly inert. But rather like Michael Hoffmans ill-fated Coens-scripted ""Gambit"" -- a slightly more disarming attempt at comparable genre-throwback territory -- the film is only frenzied never fizzy. Its arch abstract character relationships keep even the most superficial emotional stakes at bay; Depp and Paltrow make a sleek screen couple but their marital banter is too low on venom and too heavily enshrouded in quote marks to read as sexy. McGregor not ordinarily an actor who has to work especially hard to charm is stymied by a role that amounts to little more than a makeweight romantic foil for two mutually dispassionate spouses; the dynamic between them is less a love triangle than it is a sexless detente cordiale. Then again Depp has entered a realm of performance so self-amused one imagines most co-stars would struggle to forge chemistry with him. (As a margarine-slick Yank billionaire also in the hunt for the Goya the redoubtable Jeff Goldblum goes largest and comes closest.) Resplendent with eccentric Peter Sellers-indebted vocal tics and spasms his Mortdecai is neither a careless nor an artless creation. But it is for all its energy a somewhat airless one -- an experiment fostered by a film thats in thrall to little else. (Tellingly Depp also produced.) At least in line with its eponymous protagonists aesthetic sensibility the film isnt afraid to splash its money around James Merifields production design and Ruth Myers costumes both hit the right note of gauche grandeur gleaming under the bright color-intensive glare of Florian Hoffmeisters camera. And pop-funk producer extraordinaire Mark Ronson making his first foray into film scoring was an appropriate choice to assist composer Geoff Zanelli His cluttered horn arrangements are in keeping with the pics retro leanings and manic disposition. Editors Jill Savitt and Derek Ambrosi can take equal credit for the latter though at 106 busy minutes ""Mortdecai"" could use a shave. Mortdecai himself of course wouldnt dream of it.

Emberdink Humberdit says January 23 2015 at 1143 am ""...a preening lily-livered aristocrat of indeterminate provenance forced to live by his unreliable wits"" Is this movie critic describing a character in the movie or did he just get a long hard look his own mirror. At least the Mortdecai character in the movie isnt actually taking himself seriously. Reply Emberdink Humberdit says January 23 2015 at 1138 am Ill take a Johnny Depp doing something silly over some pretentious review that is just redundant and derivative any day of the week. And it does make me wonder if the Pink Panther movies that Peter Sellers started were received the same way by stale critics who are lacking in creativity and imagination. Reply jazz carpenter says January 23 2015 at 1125 am i have a feeling this will be really well recieved in europe...this is their kind of humor which america most of the time just cant seem to get behind... american viewers and journalists also cant seem to grasp the concept that british shows like sherlock and downton abbey are bbc productions and not pbs shows...really annoys me when they refer to them as such.. Reply guylodge says January 24 2015 at 248 am For the record I am not an American critic. Variety has an international review team and this was written out of London where the film was first screened for press. Also not that this has anything to do with the review at hand but Downton Abbey is not a BBC production. Rather it airs on rival British network ITV. Reply wneal5796 says January 23 2015 at 1034 am Great Review Blows the New York Times review out of the water. Covers the other workers on the film and what other jobs they have done. Guess the Times couldnt be bothered. Well with this one at least you cant say HEY I didnt know exactly what I was getting into and I DEMAND my money back Have a beer and relax people. Its just a movie. A lot of hard work to make a good one or a bad one. Id read the books prior to the film and my suspicion was that itd just capture the flavor of it and wed see some zany wacky silly stuff. And thats pretty much it. Reply jazz carpenter says January 22 2015 at 1138 pm i wont bash depp...i still find him interesting to watch no matter what he is in...(and i must admit...i really liked lone ranger...) but...when i think of the stuff he used to do like dead man blow and secret window while not perfect films there always seemed to be a lot more depth to depp... Reply jeffwinterwolfhewitt says January 22 2015 at 910 am THIRD BOMB. Reply zyggie says January 22 2015 at 842 am I dont know whats up with Depp these days. This movie reminds me of The Pink Panther which was good and a classic in so many ways. Depps movie does not look appealing. Reply Susan says January 22 2015 at 857 am If it reminds you of the ""good and a classic"" Pink Panther how does it not look appealing? Reply zyggie says January 23 2015 at 1021 am Play on words Susan. Point Blank period ....its a bad movie and its poorly done in the vein of the Pink Panther movies. Bumbling detective etc. Beaudenon says January 22 2015 at 1259 am Saw yesterday it was really awful without any interest miscasted and ugly Reply KateB says January 22 2015 at 1215 am Uh-Oh..........

If only I could feel as charitable toward ""Mortdecai"" a glamorous jet-set fantasy about crooked art dealers and stolid cops dashing about the globe on the hunt for a legendary lost Goya painting. While watching this new caper I was reminded why movies like this are called souffles in the first place if they dont stay perfectly aloft they collapse. See Video Johnny Depp Needs to Get Paid in New Mortdecai Trailer (Video) Screenwriter Eric Aronson (""On the Line"") adapting a novel by Kyril Bonfiglioli and director David Koepp (""Premium Rush"") obviously love this genre as well and its easy to sense that the cast had a great time sporting chic duds and racking up frequent-flyer miles while exchanging banter and engaging in the occasional car chase. All these ingredients never quite come together though leaving ""Mortdecai"" a glossy misfire. Johnny Depp""gt;Johnny Depp stars as Lord Charlie Mortdecai an unscrupulous art collector who usually escapes his shady deals only with the support of his manservant Jock (Paul Bettany clearly relishing a rare chance to play comedy). Up to his new Franz Josef mustache in debt -- and estranged from his beautiful wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) who gags every time she comes near that swoopy bit of facial hair -- Mortdecai must accept an assignment from Inspector Martland (Ewan McGregor) to track down the Goya. Complicating matters are terrorist Strago (Jonny Pasvolsky) who wants the painting for himself as does American billionaire Krampf (Jeff Goldblum). And while Krampfs randy daughter Georgina (an underutilized Olivia Munn) puts the make on Mortdecai Martland continues to moon after Johanna whom he still loves even though Mortdecai won her heart when the three were at Oxford. Also Read Jennifer Lopez Johnny Depp and George Lucas Battle for 2nd at Box Office Theres a very delicate skill involved in this sort of raised-eyebrow international-intrigue comedy and while Aronson and Koepp sometimes get it and sometimes dont the casting of Depp certainly doesnt help. Sporting gap teeth and plummy what-ho accent the actor takes another opportunity to busy himself with props and silly voices rather than bothering to give a performance. On the heels of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Dark Shadows"" it appears that Depp has turned himself into Mike Myers -- not the ""Austin Powers"" Myers the ""Love Guru"" Myers. Granted anyone would have difficulty making lines like ""Every man needs a Jock"" land but Depps performance is so fussy and commenting-upon-itself that it just makes matters even worse. Paltrow to her credit knows exactly what movie shes in drinking in every witty riposte outsmarting everyone around her and knowing how to make just standing there into a punchline. Cinematographer Florian Hoffmeister (""The Deep Blue Sea"") makes Paltrow look creamy and delicious in every shot and she in return gives the movie its solidly second-best performance behind only the deadly and droll Bettany. Also Read 5 Gwyneth Paltrow Revelations From Howard Stern Interview Iron Mans Missing Script Brad Pitt Ben Affleck Breakups ""Mortdecai"" is by no means a disaster -- the occasional joke lands and theres at least some fun to be found in the frenetic farce of all the conspiracies and the running-around (Its certainly not the fiasco that the recent barely-released remake of ""Gambit"" was). Still I spent most of the movie waiting for it to find its rhythms and set a witty pace for itself that would allow the humor to build and the outrageous situations to pay off grandly. Could we get a do-over with say Steven Soderbergh in the directors chair and an actual British comedian in the title role? (And while were making wishes could Johnny Depp go make a movie for Lars Von Trier or Nicole Holofcener or someone else who will strip him of the disguises and the dialects?) Theres nothing wrong with a little trifle so long as you know how to make it palatable.
