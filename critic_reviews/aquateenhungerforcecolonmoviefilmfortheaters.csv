"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie reviewed. Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 12 2007 553 PM Like Vomit But in a good way Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie. By Dana Stevens Aqua Teen Hunger Force Writing about a cult object as impenetrable as Aqua Teen Hunger Force ColonMovie Film for Theaters (First Look Pictures) based on the Cartoon Network animated series poses a dilemma. Do you go and rent six years worth of the show familiarize yourself with its coded mythology and then embark on an earnest explanation of the Aqua Teen universe that accounts for the shows devoted underground audience? Nah thats for suckers. Sure Ive caught the show a few times in the late-night Adult Swim lineup but Im going to review the movie the way that Aqua Teens trio of protagonists approach everything they do as lazily and as ignorantly as possible. As explained in the theme song an infectious rap by Schoolly D that trio consists of Frylock a sarcastic box of French fries (voiced by Carey Means); Master Shake a narcissistic dairy drink (voiced by Dana Snyder); and Meatwad a transcendently stupid blob of ground beef (voiced by Dave Willis who co-created the series with Matt Maiellaro). These sentient snacks live together in suburban New Jersey in a graffiti-covered wood-paneled house where they play video games and squabble with their slovenly neighbor Carl (also voiced by Willis). Advertisement To the extent that the film has a story at all its an attempt to supply an origin myth for its three fast-food heroes. Did they exist in some earlier reincarnation in Ancient Egypt (as suggested in a Dadaist opening flashback with the subtitle ""Ancient Egypt Thousands of Years Ago 3 p.m. 1492"")? Or were they created by their nemesis the mad scientist Dr. Weird in his mountaintop laboratory thats been converted into condo lofts? Whatever their beginnings the Hunger Forces mission in the present day is to keep an evil exercise machine called the Insanoflex from taking over the world. To do so theyll need to have repeated and increasingly senseless interactions with the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past a talking watermelon slice that flies around in a hollowed-out watermelon spaceship and the Mooninites two slow-moving aliens straight out of a Pong-era video game. (It was the Mooninites pictured on otherwise unmarked flashing signs during a guerilla marketing campaign in Boston last winter who caused the bomb scare that resulted in a 2 million settlement from Turner Broadcasting.) That I think will do for plot summary since to watch ATHF is to give up entirely on linear narrative and just sort of groove on the sudden shifts of pop-cultural reality. ATHF can seem brilliantly deconstructive one moment and stupefyingly boring the next--or to provide a more accurate ratio it can follow five brilliant seconds with five straight minutes of boredom. At 87 minutes this movie could hardly be any shorter and still count as a feature film but it still plods for long stretches. On TV the show exists in the form of 12-minute-or-less bursts between commercials and thats about as long as the movie sustains any individual joke. But some of them are good while they last--especially the opening riff on those old ""Lets All Go to the Lobby"" bumpers in which boxes of popcorn and candy cheerfully beg to be eaten. ATHF bears some resemblance to South Park (Id love to see a Venn diagram of the two shows overlapping audiences) but it lacks South Parks economical storytelling and ripped-from-the-headlines topicality. Neither a satire a pastiche nor a parody Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters is like the bright-colored gunk you might vomit up after a weekend of gorging on cartoons B movies and bad science fiction. But when I compare the movie to vomit I dont mean it in a bad way--a paradox that Willis and Maiellaro with their scatological stoner-friendly humor would probably understand.

With the voices of Dave Willis Matt Maiellaro Dana Snyder and Neil Peart. Directed by Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro. (R. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters"" is difficult to recommend without first knowing the sobriety of the viewer. If youre the type of person who routinely smokes marijuana in a purple conversion van before you enter a theater this will almost certainly be the best movie you see all year. If you enjoy the predictability and structure of televisions ""Two and a Half Men"" it will probably be the worst. How random is the ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" movie? An exaggerating robot aliens from Pluto and the moon an all-powerful piece of exercise equipment the Phil Collins song ""In the Air Tonight"" an evil slice of watermelon Cheez Whiz and a miniature version of Rush drummer Neil Peart all figure prominently into what passes as a plot. Even the title seems designed specifically to trip audiences out or at least confuse critics. The ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" film features an anthropomorphic Happy Meal whose contents are named Frylock Master Shake and Meatwad. But they appear to be adults stay on land throughout the movie and fight neither crime nor hunger. ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" is a popular animated television program that runs during the Cartoon Networks stoner-friendly late-night ""Adult Swim"" programming block. It is filled with non sequiturs and intentional nonsense. Next to ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny "" looks like a Ken Burns documentary. In the movie co-writers Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis craft a vague origin story for the trio. Theres also something about the exercise equipment threatening the destruction of the universe. But unlike most cult TV shows that become feature films -- the recent ""Reno 911"" movie comes to mind -- theres no effort by Maiellaro and Willis to simplify things for a mainstream audience or even introduce new characters. Ive never watched more than five minutes of the TV show and it took about half the movie to get used to the pace which might feature a time-traveling Abraham Lincoln one minute a frat house on the planet Pluto the next. (""Go ahead and do it"" an alien says when his dormitory roommate is threatened. ""I get straight As if he dies."") Once youre initiated the movie is frequently clever with humor that relies mostly on pop culture jokes or just the idiocy of the movies main characters. A large percentage of the inhabitants of the ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" world seem to suffer from megalomania and talk like deranged Third World dictators. This is funnier than it sounds since the most boastful characters are also the dumbest. Trying to explain the movie any further is futile except to say its an acquired taste leaning toward those who like to escape reality once in a while. Just try not to break too many laws on the way to the theater. -- Advisory This movie contains adult language and animated gore. Parents should note that just because movies are animated or feature puppets that doesnt mean you should bring your kids. (Or didnt you learn your lesson from ""Team America World Police""?)

Friday April 13 2007 400 AM FOOD FOR NO THOUGHT ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters"" Two and a half stars Feature version of the surreal animated TV series about talking food. At area theaters (126). R Language violent images crude humor. So insane it approaches a sort of mad brilliance this full-length Cartoon Network spinoff must have been made with chemical enhancement in mind. Enter with a clear head at your own risk. The main characters in the ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" series are Master Shake a moronic milk shake; Meatwad a sweetly stupid meatball and Frylock a sarcastic container of French fries. The plot - which finds the trio facing off against a crazy scientist and his mystical exercise machine - is proudly useless except as a starting point for random sex jokes scatological riddles and non sequiturs beyond all comprehension. Theres nothing here for kids or for that matter anyone who claims to be an adult. But if the title makes perfect sense to you the movie probably will too. Elizabeth Weitzman MAXIMUM INSECURITY ""Red Road"" Three stars Drama about a Scottish security guard who takes revenge on the man who destroyed her life. At the Lincoln Plaza and Landmark Sunshine (153). Not rated Nudity sex language. If you think about it too closely Andrea Arnolds jarring feature debut doesnt quite hold up. But chances are youll be so focused on her lead Kate Dickie that you wont even notice. Dickie has already won awards for her portrayal of Jackie a security camera operator in Glasgow. One day while scanning her boring bank of screens she notices a familiar face. With a shock of horror she realizes shes looking at the man who carelessly shattered her life years before. Unable to simply sit and watch him she feels compelled to force a confrontation. Though Jackies desperate actions and the unlikely consequences do feel somewhat contrived the movies intense focus skillfully exposes the raw pain just under the skin of a seemingly ordinary citizen. E.W. DRIFTING APART ""Private Fears in Public Places"" Road worrier Nathalie Press in Red Road the impressive debut by director Andrea Arnold. Two and a half stars Drama about the overlapping lives of six lonely people during a Paris snowstorm. At Lincoln Plaza and IFC Center (200). Not rated Mature themes. In French with subtitles. Alain Resnais directs this slight but evocative story an equally sad and funny adaptation of British playwright Alan Ayckbourns play (moving the location from London to Paris) in which six characters spend a snowstorm trying to overcome loneliness. Snow falls around them throughout the film symbolizing the coldness of their isolation and it is still falling by the end. In the two hours running time we come to know and like most of the six particularly the gentle real estate agent Thierry (Andre Dussollier) and his assistant Charlotte (Sabine Azema) a devout woman with a private passion for exhibitionism. The taped religious programs she gives to Thierry include brief inserts of her stripping for the camera. Charlotte also strips for a cranky bedridden old man whose reports of her performance are taken by his son for hallucinations and land him in an old folks home. The film is beautifully shot and edited but these emotional snapshots wont stay long in the memory. Jack Mathews JUST SLACKING OFF ""Everythings Gone Green"" Two stars Comedy about a Canadian slacker trying to find his moral compass. At the Landmark Sunshine (135). R language sexuality drugs. Douglas Coupland earned enormous attention for his first novel 1991s ""Generation X."" His first screenplay - directed with sitcommy self-consciousness by Paul Fox - is unlikely to make the same sort of splash. Part of the problem is that quirky comedies about twentysomething slackers are awfully easy to come by these days. And while there are a few solid laughs in this one they dont add up to a very memorable whole. A good guy without much ambition Ryan (Paulo Costanzo) is perfectly content to float through life until he stumbles onto a moneymaking scheme while working for the Vancouver Lottery. Suddenly hes got it made. So why isnt he happier? The dialogue does have Couplands characteristic snap but like its mellow hero the movie takes the easy route just a little too often.

Already privileged with that knowledge you may skip to the page listing the running times for your animated object of desire. The rest of us shall delve deeper into the Wikipedia entry not so much because we actually care but because it is so amusing to read the concept of an absurdist anarchic relentlessly sarcastic cartoon translated into the bland authoritative tone of an encyclopedia entry. ""The title of the show is largely a misnomer"" Wikipedias grand expositors and fanboys dutifully inform us. ""The characters have no major affiliation with water (though many episodes involve their neighbors pool) and they are not teenagers per se and have somewhat frequently issued conflicting statements regarding their ages. They resemble food (hence the reference to hunger) but they are rarely shown acting as any kind of force."" Well. There you have it. In short ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" is about none of the above. Its about a carton of French fries a milkshake and a meat wad of uncertain origins (or destinations for that matter) who insult each other and everyone else and occasionally confront a mad scientist. ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" originated years ago as part of the Adult Swim animation showcase on Cartoon Network. It grew inexorably kind of like the U.S. tax code and is now presented here as a full-length movie. Fifteen minutes of witty banter between a large order of fries and a milkshake that is willfully ignorant even by the low standards of dairy desserts is tolerable even amusing. Especially when playing the college drinking games for which ""Aqua Teen"" seems a natural backdrop. But stretched past 70 minutes ""Aqua Teens"" eventually grows tedious. Its a difficult thing to make ""Beavis amp; Butt-head"" play like Proust but ""Aqua Teen"" gives it a go. Some readers feel disoriented without at least a sentence of attempted plot description. We do our best Our three fast food items decide to get in better physical shape; they cant figure out the home exercise machine theyve been using to dry their laundry; they discover the machine was part of an evil plot to destroy all mankind. Or something like that I might have fallen asleep just before the watermelon slice accepted responsibility. Fans of ""Aqua Teen"" who couldnt wait for the next TV season? Youll likely love it. The uninitiated? It would be a lot cheaper to watch five minutes of the Cartoon Network. Save your money for some higher-quality nonanimated fast food. ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" R for language gross-out humor | 1 hour 27 minutes | ADULT ANIMATION | Written and directed by Matt Maiellaro and David Willis; featuring the voices of Maiellaro and Willis Carey Means and Dana Snyder | Opens today at Landmarks Mayan Theater.

"OK we get the Aqua Teen joke; its still not funny - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW OK we get the Aqua Teen joke; its still not funny By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  April 13 2007 So the city of Boston was caught with its collective pants down by the Cartoon Network s guerrilla promotion of ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force "" last January? So we panicked over Lite Brites attached to bridges and behaved like a bunch of old maids who wouldnt know pop culture if it hit them square in the snood?So maybe we had a point. ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters "" the big-screen version of the popular ""Adult Swim "" cartoon is essentially an act of terrorism against entertainment. Its inconsequential potty - mouthed extremely silly and -- the worst sin of all -- dead boring.If youre already a fan of the crudely animated TV adventures of a meatball a milkshake and a bag of french fries youll want to reverse the above judgment. Of course if youre already a fan youre probably really really stoned and youll find meaning in the dimples on a golf ball. Making sense isnt the point of ""Aqua Teen"" or rather making not-sense is the point. I get it. I just dont have much use for it not when its this pleased with itself.When the show started in December 2000  the goateed reasonable Frylock (the voice of Carey Means ) vain jerk Master Shake (Dana Snyder ) and dimly sweet-natured Meatwad (show co-creator Dave Willis ) were briefly superheroes. That charade was dropped in favor of random slacker vaudeville The three heroes argue a lot lock horns with the sleazy guy next door and are visited by among many others pixellated aliens who look like refugees from ""Space Invaders.""""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters"" -- like everything else here the title doesnt quite scan and thats whats funny dude -- briefly touches on the characters origins before bringing on Abraham Lincoln as a testy inventor gay extraterrestrials from Pluto and a diabolic exercise machine from the future.Sounds pretty bent maybe even funny? It is in fits and starts. Its also padded beyond all reason even at 86 minutes. ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" changes gears so often and with such little effect that you just drift off and start thinking about your laundry.Fans will be happy to see recurring characters like Dr. Weird and MC Pee Pants  a giant rapping spider in a diaper. Non-fans will consider that a warning. Its a binary experience Youre either in on this thing or youre not. If not with the proper chemical enhancement you too may find daring post-modern comedy in ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force."" Or in a cat toy.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

In one of the sillier recent instances of terrorist paranoia Boston filed criminal charges against hirelings who installed cryptic electronic street signage promoting this Cartoon Network spinoff. Resulting controversy didnt spike ratings for the latenight cable series and probably wont significantly impact a movie that will draw members of the shows ardent fan base but few others before ancillary release. Still this feature-length expansion offers a diverting package of surreal rude stoner- and pop culture-based humor that will delight youthful viewers while bewildering stray elders. ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" is a cartoon ""Hellzapoppin "" for those weaned on videogames hip-hop and overblown mall flicks. Its protagonists are talking animate fast-food items. Dairy product Master Shake (voiced by Dana Snyder) is a vain bossy type whose bright ideas are invariably dim ones. His bullying works well enough on gullible Meatwad (Dave Willis who like series co-creator Matt Maiellaro voices numerous characters). Meatwad is a blob of expired ground-beef-like matter capable of surprise morphing and other talents. The operations brains belong to Frylock (Carey Means) a goateed pocket of salty fries that can be fired at will like rockets yet his voice of intelligent skepticism is rarely heeded. The Aqua Teens (a moniker that like much else here has no practical explanation) live in a dumpy New Jersey house next to slobby human Carl (Willis) whos forever irked by their intrusions into his lowbrow lifestyle. A big leap beyond the 15-minute Cartoon Net segments ""Colon Movie Film"" is more elaborate in technical terms drawing on a wider array of deliberately clashing animation styles. Still it hews faithfully to the series anarchic scatological tenor. Characters are introd in a parodic 1960s-style ""Intermission Time"" with singing concession items rudely interrupted by aggressive heavy-metal snacks shouting aggressive audience exhortations (""If I see you videotaping this movie/Satan will rain hot acid down your throat""). Then titles identify the setting as ""Egypt Millions of Years Ago 3 p.m. 1492 New York."" The Aqua Teens are seen breaking out of a pyramid crypt only to be attacked by a giant poodle. All this turns out to be another fabrication of the trios collective backstory by the braggarty Master Shake. But dont expect plot logic to kick in once this prelude is exposed as a sham. There is a semblance of a narrative thread to the features remainder The Insane-O-Flex a home exercise machine Shake has stolen from Carl turns out to be an unstoppable killing thingy that wreaks havoc on the general populace. Force trio attempts to stop the Insane-O-Flex in its usual disorganized fashion fending off numerous others who want to control the machine for their own obscurely nefarious purposes. Among them are megalomaniac mad scientist Dr. Weird and hapless assistant Steve (both voiced by C. Martin Croker); Err and Ignignokt 2-D tributes to old Atari game figures; Oglethorpe and Emory would-be conquerors from the ""Plutonian League""; their often inappropriately horny ally Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past; and drummer Neal Peart from veteran progressive-metal trio Rush. If this all sounds like a bunch of nonsense rest assured it is -- gleefully so. Perhaps the best description of what both the feature and its long-running TV-show source aim for was supplied by Maiellaro in an interview ""If its not funny at least its weird and unexpected."" ""Colon Movie Film"" is not laugh-out-loud stuff most of the time. But its sheer imaginative arbitrariness can be delightful provided viewers can connect to its admittedly limited-access wavelength. R rating is fully merited by frequently tasteless content though the absurdism at work feels less offensive than loutish tube toons like ""Family Guy."" Soundtrack choices are another platform for in-joke satire with Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight"" particularly flogged.

"Aqua Teen Fast-Food Sensation washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Aqua Teen Fast-Food Sensation Fries Shake and Meatwad are heroes who save New Jersey in the wacky ""Aqua Teen."" (First Look Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 13 2007 I am not making this up. I couldnt make this up. My imagination isnt powerful enough. I just saw a movie in which a pack of french fries a wad of ground beef and a milkshake save the world -- or at least New Jersey -- from a psychotic giant exercise machine built 70000 years ago by aliens. ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters"" is a work of either a profoundly transgressive genius or a goofball high on Pez and patio sealant. It could come from no normal collection of brain cells. The film the work of Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis -- unclear which is the genius and which the sealant -- is an outgrowth of their below-the-radar (or shall I be honest and say below- my- radar) television show on the Cartoon Network. The animated 87 minutes feels pretty much beyond description; only its repercussions can be charted and they include spastic laughter drool collecting in your lap defibrillation oxygen debt panic attacks loss of bodily fluids until abruptly about minute 72 when everything is replaced by tedium though hilarity returns in the last minute with the line ""I am your mother a nine-layer bean burrito."" That line also more or less sums up the non sequitur nature of the enterprise which relies for its considerable humor power on almost-free-associative bizarre jumps of logic. Its like it was written on a mouse not a keyboard. It was clicked not typed. Does anyone out there really want to watch me try to describe a plot? What are you people sadists? The movie is too young for plot and Im too old for it. It seems more or less to have to do with three musketeers of the fast-food family who live in a run-down New Jersey house. Hmm some of it doesnt make much sense. Meatwad moves by turning himself into a wheel and rotating. Shake appears not to be ambulatory but is towed places in a ""danger cart"" with one real wheel and Meatwad rolling rolling rolling up front providing the go-power. But what about Fries? He just seems to float although he can lift stuff with his fry-arms fight martial arts style run machinery and so forth. And why does he have a goatee and a kind of satanic cast to his face which is inscribed on the cardboard front of his packet (which encompasses the fries)? Toto I have a feeling were not in Kansas anymore. Where we are it seems is in the post-Robert Smigel world. Smigel the fabulous wit behind ""Saturday Night Lives"" TV Funhouse has pioneered the use of short logic-free surrealistic blasts of comedy usually built around a profoundly lame ""story"" pushed relentlessly to its logical conclusion and expressed in animation that is again profoundly lame and therefore profoundly humorous. Smigels ""The Ambiguously Gay Duo"" would be the ""Brothers Karamazov"" of this niche though some of the tricks he plays with ambient sound set to anarchistic imagery is also genius beyond description. Maiellaro and Willis only occasionally rise to Smigels heights and the length of their endeavor really presses the patience limit of most non-clinically-diagnosed people. But for a long time -- even most of the time -- its funny when say the Insane-o-Flex machine goes on a ""Beast From 20000 Fathoms"" jag in an amusement park and Mr. French Fry (I think; I didnt take any notes as it seemed ridiculous to be writing down hamburger dialogue) manages to shut it down by riding to the top of the Python Roller Coaster and zapping it with magic electricity. I should add that the movie begins and ends with a far more conventional bit of animated satire in which the beloved dancing refreshments are overcome and beaten by a heavy metal band of other refreshments and sing a song the likes of which you never thought youd hear from singing ice cream cones. Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters (87 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for crude and sexual humor violent images and profanity.
