Cinema is a hostage of narrative. And Im very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema."" He was referring to his film Children of Men and he captured its strengths and weakness admirably. It is a frequently moving occasionally harrowing tour de force of cinematic technique; yet it is also somehow hollow. It was simultaneously one of last years best movies (better I think than any of those nominated for Best Picture) and one of its larger disappointments. The film just released on DVD is an adaptation of the 1993 P.D. James novel The Children of Men and Cuarons alterations were not limited to trimming the definite article from the title. Jamess novel was an explicitly Christian fable about faith and loss love and solitude our duties as parents of children and as children of parents. Cuaron hewed back these themes aggressively and substituted contemporary political references--to Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib to anti-immigrant sentiment in Great Britain and the United States to firefights on the streets of Iraq. But while Cuarons changes add resonance to Jamess story they dont offer meaning. Children of Men retains the shape of a parable but lacks the message.In Jamess original telling the year is 2021 and it has been 25 years since the worlds last human being was born. The cause of this mass infertility--biological catastrophe? divine retribution?--is unknown but it has led to a deep global malaise. Humankind is gradually petering out and with it all hope and passion and moral scruple. Decoupled from any possibility of procreation even sex has lost its recreational appeal. People want little more than ""freedom from fear freedom from want freedom from boredom."" In Great Britain they are granted these limited blessings by the Warden of England an omnipotent but widely popular dictator. Jamess protagonist Theo is a history professor (one of many professions rendered quasi-irrelevant by the fact that there are no longer any young people) and a man whose life is empty of purpose but full of regret--for unkindnesses to his now-deceased parents for a ruined marriage for the baby daughter he accidentally ran over with a car and killed decades earlier. (Jamess description of this last is one of the most crushing passages Ive ever read and not merely because I have a 20-month-old of my own.) But Theo is also cousin friend and former adviser to the Warden of England and it is for this reason that he is approached by a small group of ineffectual revolutionaries in whose conspiracy he gradually becomes entangled.Cuaron rightly simplifies this story for the screen. His Theo (Clive Owen) is not an academic but a mid-level bureaucrat and his connection to a government minister is less close and less lofty. When the radicals approach him it is in part because one of them is his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) and all they ask from him is that he obtain papers that will enable a young African ""fugee"" (refugee) named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) to travel from London to the coast. He does but the papers require him to travel with her and it soon becomes apparent that she is pregnant--the first woman so blessed in two decades. (Kee does not appear in the novel; rather it is Julian who becomes pregnant and this revelation--and the consequent journey from London--doesnt take place until much later in the story.) The hope is that with Theos help Kee will be able to rendezvous with a ship belonging to the Human Project (another Cuaron addition) a legendary secretive group of scientists who will help her deliver and care for her baby. On the way Theo and Kee are beset on all sides--by government police by vengeful revolutionaries by rioting fugees and by the Army units sent to put them down. The political landscape Cuaron paints is a brutal one and he paints it in a palette of dirt and drizzle. Rarely has ugliness been portrayed with such beauty as it is by Cuaron and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. The future they envision is unlike the techno-camp of Brazil or even the cyber-grunge of Bladerunner; rather with the exception of a few sleek computer monitors scattered about this is a world where things have been wearing out for 20 years and no one has much bothered to replace let alone improve them. London is still London only dirtier and with heavy iron cages for captured fugees as ubiquitous as streetcorner mailboxes.Cuarons accelerated plot gets him quickly out of this urban blight and into the still more savage countryside. There he stages a few of the most nail-biting cinematic sequences in recent years--a roadside ambush shocking in its sudden violence an excruciating escape in a car that wont start (echoes of Night of the Living Dead) and a long quasi-single-shot trek (actually composed of a few shots stitched seamlessly together) through several blocks of an internment-camp war zone. Its refreshing to see filmmaking so kinetic that aspires to more than just stylishness In the internment-camp scene for instance Cuaron has explained that the single-shot format was an effort to make the environment itself a character in the film an effort that succeeds brilliantly.In addition to the bravura direction Children of Men has a powerful script (by Cuaron and several co-writers) and smart committed performances--especially by Owen who has quickly become one of the most compelling leading men in film. Yet despite all this Children of Men founders in its latter moments--not a lot but enough. Its failure is less one of plot than of something deeper a composing idea to undergird the plot.The problem is that a world without children is clearly a metaphor but Cuaron doesnt quite seem to know for what. James is a devout Anglican and for her the meaning of a world without children is entirely clear It is a world without God. The creation of new life is after all not only the most palpable miracle to which most of us will ever be privy but a form of afterlife as well (especially for those of us who unlike James are skeptical of the literal kind). Children give us hope and purpose that extends beyond our own spans on Earth and the knowledge that after were gone we will still be judged. For James a world without God is an abomination.For Cuaron--who is not to my knowledge a religious believer or at least not one so fervent as James--a world without God looks a lot like well the world perhaps with a few more internment camps dotting the landscape. Much of his film seems disconnected from the central fact of a childless society which for him serves as little more than an explanation for public lethargy in the face of a repressive police state. At times there is even explicit tension between Cuarons purposes and Jamess original vision Ross Douthat for instance smartly noted that the anti-immigrant fervor Cuaron has made a central element of the film makes very little sense in the context of a barren nation Wouldnt a tired and aging populace want to import immigrant labor (as it does in Jamess novel) to help with societys menial tasks? Cuaron is a ferociously gifted filmmaker (among his accomplishments hes the only director to have brought anything resembling magic to the Harry Potter oeuvre) but he is not a polemicist and The Children of Men is a polemical work. Dispensing with Jamess Anglican allegory is fine; but Cuaron fails to develop an alternative animating premise that might have given purpose to his narrative.It isnt until the end of the film that the awkward fit between Jamess vision and Cuarons becomes truly problematic. (Spoiler alert.) Both novel and film climax with the birth of a child. In Jamess book its made quite explicit that this event has changed the world forever; the old order moral and political will be overthrown. When Kee gives birth in the film by contrast Cuaron seems unsure what significance if any to attach to this historic development. When the warring soldiers and immigrants of the internment camp witness the babys face they lower their weapons and stare in wonderment--for about 90 seconds following which they go back to shooting at one another. Has the world changed any at all? Will it? The fact that Kee and Theo and the baby are trying to flee the country rather than mend it further undermines any narrative connection between the miraculous birth and the future of Cuarons tyrannical British state. As a result a film that began as the story of a society concludes as the story merely of a man and a woman and a baby (their own fates largely ambiguous) a moral shrinkage that drains of import everything that has come before. This is the fundamental disappointment of Children of Men It is a film pregnant with meaning that in the end gives birth only to questions.The Home Movies List Clive NotesCroupier (1998). Owen already had a decade of British stage and television under his belt when this Mike Hodges neo-noir first got him attention stateside. Credit Roger Ebert who compared Owen to a young Connery with starting the Owen-as-007 meme that would persist for nearly a decade.Gosford Park (2001). When your performance stands out in a cast featuring (among many others) Helen Mirren Emily Watson Michael Gambon and Maggie Smith its a pretty clear sign youve arrived. Owen was perhaps the closest thing to a lead in this marvelous but very unAltmanlike Altman film a social analysis posing as a comedy of manners posing as a murder mystery. Ill Sleep When Im Dead (2003). Another Hodges film about British hoods that was elevated by Owens presence. In terms of plot though it borrowed rather heavily from Hodgess 1971 movie Get Carter a classic of the genre and one of the most lean vicious thrillers ever made. King Arthur (2004). A big-budget effort at mythical revisionism that was an intermittently interesting mess but still a mess. Looking a bit silly as in the title role of Roman-cavalryman-turned-British-protector Owen gave signs that his thoughtful brooding charisma may be a poor fit for such epic fare. Closer (2004). Owen appeared in the original play back in 1997 before Hollywood came knocking which may be one reason he was so very very good in a movie that was truly bad. Sin City (2005). Like King Arthur another role that didnt really suit the talents of Owen who burns a good deal cooler than Frank Millers homicidal antiheroes. (It didnt help that he got the weakest of the three plotlines.) Derailed (2005). Though it thankfully failed to live up to the promise of its title with regard to Owens career (and that of costar Jennifer Aniston) it took its best shot. A true stinker for completists only. The Pink Panther (2006). Owens cameo as Agent 006 in this witless act of cinematic vandalism is the closest hes likely ever to come to playing James Bond a fact that is considerably less sad now that weve seen what Daniel Craig is capable of. Inside Man (2006). Here was a role better-suited to Owen the cool methodical bank robber more than happy to let his deeds speak for him. That his cat-and-mouse interplay took place with an equally suave Denzel Washington was an added delight.This post originally appeared at TNR.com.

Twitter previousJohn McCain PorkernextBeware The Clinton Hype Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

(In case youre wondering the films relationship to the P.D. James novel approaches absolute zero). Instead our hero Theo (a craggy Clive Owen) drives a creaky hatchback and pads around in flip-flops. Its all very normal and very very frightening. Though its two decades from now society hasnt advanced--its been derailed by pandemics war pollution and infertility. The first three factors have killed the worlds happiness; worldwide sterility has killed off their hopes. The youngest human alive is 18 years and five months old and the rest of our species is left checking their watches waiting for extinction. Londoner Theo is an activist gone disillusioned by the daily crush of bombings and dust. While the English media claims proudly that though ""The world has collapsed only Britain soldiers on"" its ghastly to imagine how bad off the rest of the globe is if the UKs raging mobs and violence are the peak of civilization. Cuaron never slows down for exposition but we glean that Seattle is gripped by a three-year siege and New York is off the map. England must be better than most because illegal refugees (i.e. all of them) are flocking to its shores like weary crows only to be locked up in cages and abused  (their black hoods provoke guilty shudders). Except for the flashy billboards and omnipresent security cameras London has bombed itself back to the medieval ages. Cows burn in the fields and the streets are cluttered with rickshaws and religious flagellants. The wealthy continue to over-medicate their video game obsessed offspring while the teenagers of the poor run wild with bats and guns. And scariest of all is the grim awareness that this dystopia is just an exaggeration of our sins over-consumption xenophobia terrorism. Plus their music is terrible--all screams and thuds it could almost make a fuddy-duddy long for the good old days of Good Charlotte. But back to Theo. Theo grumpily believes that infertility didnt come soon enough as the globe had already hit the tipping point between peace and hell. This month hes twice narrowly escaped a cafe explosion and is just trying to live gray and invisible between his office job and his small afternoons of joy in the woodland cabin of his friend Jasper (a wild-haired Michael Caine) who laments that although the government is touting a suicide pill named Quietus (the pitch-perfect commercial shows a beachcomber fading away peacefully into the sunset) weed--or ""ganja"" as the old hippie prefers--is still verboten. But then in a series of sucker-punches Theos ex-wife (Julianne Moore) the leader of a besieged rebel gang calls on him to get a young girl to freedom. A young refugee girl. Whos pregnant. What follows is a rare action flick that fires on all cylinders. Its thrilling scary cerebral and emotional. Cuaron is a master of the subtle knife twist and the suffocating long take. His early daring escape scene drags out with two stalled cars rolling uselessly across a muddy field--at half the speed its twice as nerve-wracking. His disorienting gun battles are painful to watch as the pinging bullets and rubble and unorchestrated chaos and women cradling and crying over their wounded sons look less like science fiction than the evening news from Palestine. As Theo the realest action hero in decades whose car is junk and nose runs and shoes dont fit struggles to get headstrong Kee (Clair-Hope Ashley) and her unborn child to safety they limp through this evocatively familiar landscape. Even the graffiti on the walls feels resonant ranging from chalked-up Guernicas (the original hangs in the mansion of Theos rich cousin) to spray-painted scrawls that amidst all the destruction recall prehistoric cave paintings and testify to the frailty and longevity of humankind. Ultimately what cuts deeply about Children of Men is that in 2027--years after Christmas 06 a period which has seen the world much divided into religions and soldiers--Cuaron asks us to find hope in a grim nativity story where scores of innocents die as another reluctant hero and scared ignorant would-be mother try to find shelter in a land that so desperately needs a newborn savior. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Sexton David Arata Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby is based on the futuristic sci-fi novel by P.D. James. If I had seen it before I compiled my ""Movies Other People Liked and I Didnt"" list for 2006 it would have been a strong contender. I just dont get it--which is to say that many reviewers took it very seriously as a commentary on our times to say nothing of our dismal future whereas by the time it was over I felt that I could approach it only as pure farce. The world created by Mr. Cuaron and his collaborators--dystopia schmystopia as I like to say--is so laughably unbelievable even as sci-fi fantasy that I find it hard to write about with a straight face. Yet what I find particularly irksome about it is its pseudo-humanism and its calculating political correctness. The year is 2027. England of all places has become the last refuge of a devastated and debilitated world and by all the hyper-expressionistic evidence its not proving to be much of a refuge for the polyglot masses swarming into it. Immigrants are being pursued and persecuted from one corner of the realm to the other but one never sees any signs of normal existence much less architectural manifestations of wealth and power. The big news in the Big Brother-ish electronic media is that humanity is slowly withering away because all the women have become barren. Exactly why the female of the species cannot give birth was never made entirely clear at least to me--yet by the inexorable laws of the genre a succession of enormous human follies was obviously responsible beginning no doubt with Iraq. Theo (Clive Owen) the strangely passive protagonist is a one-time political activist who when his girlfriend (Julianne Moore) walks out on him with no explanation loses interest in the movement. This mini-biography is parceled out to us in dribs and drabs over the course of an endless (and endlessly scenic) excursion into the ruins of a dying civilization. Actually we first see Theo going to work in his soul-destroying bureaucratic job albeit with civil-service benefits. Everywhere he walks there are enormous posters proclaiming the existence of something called ""The Human Project"" a nonsensical government program under the circumstances. Clearly compelling characterization isnt going to be one of the films priorities despite no less than five writing credits. Mr. Owen for example has never had a part as colorless and as hapless as he has here. The emphasis throughout is on mise-en-scene over narrative. In this respect Emmanuel Lubezkis virtuoso single-take cinema-tography dazzles the eye but demeans the actors as it thrusts them into one grotesquely angular composition after another just to demonstrate how completely shattered the cityscape has become. After a while one stops caring what the characters are saying--once they can stop dodging bullets long enough to engage in conversation. In this always-perilous atmosphere when a seeming pack of hoodlums kidnaps Theo on his way to work and hustles him into a van we have been conditioned to expect at least a good beating waiting for him at the end of the vans journey. But no such luck for action-movie freaks When Theos blindfold is removed he discovers that he is in the hands of old associates in the resistance movement--led by an old comrade (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Theos old girlfriend--who want him to use his government contacts to secure some exit papers for a piece of precious human cargo. When Theo discovers that this precious cargo is an amazingly (under the circumstances) pregnant young woman (Claire-Hope Ashitey) he is emotionally energized to the point of becoming obsessed with getting this young Madonna out of the country safely. But he is beset by indiscriminate violence--wielded not only by the relentless government security forces but by the undisciplined underground fighters as well. About the only characters with whom Theo can speak freely are his old girlfriend and an old fellow hippie (Michael Caine) and he loses them both fairly early on in his messianic travels and travails. The chases such as they are are grotesquely abstract. At one point Theo is trying to escape from his pursuers by pushing a car--the motor of which he cannot start--down a small hill and then running after it like the hilarious characters in Little Miss Sunshine. And the film ends up drowning in its tortured symbolism with two of the characters occupying a small rowboat in what seems like a small lake. Many people found this ending spiritually inspiring; I found it depressingly pretentious. I was particularly disappointed because I greatly admired Mr. Cuarons Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001). Alas different genre different results. A Bit Much Karen Moncrieffs The Dead Girl from her own screenplay may have bitten off more than it can chew with its convoluted narrative structure multiple discrete episodes involving several women who are linked only by the corpse of a dead girl. Toni Collettes Arden discovers the body in a field in Southern California. Arden is the morbidly repressed daughter of a shrewishly cackling invalid mother (Piper Laurie). After discovering the body and notifying the police Arden becomes a minor celebrity in the town much to the disgust of her mother. When Arden agrees to go out on a date with a sexually aggressive grocery worker she perversely proposes that he tie her up and rape her. When he hesitates she resignedly agrees to a round of old-fashioned consensual sex after which she decides to run off with him and abandon her mother to the tender mercies of the authorities. Leah (Rose Byrne) works in the county morgue and she hopes against hope that the dead girl is her long-lost missing sister whose discovery--even in this ghoulish context--would enable Leah to get on with her own life. This she does anyway after a fashion with a lab co-worker from the morgue with whom she participates in a graphically lurid one-night stand. The most startling characterization is that of Mary Beth Hurts Ruth as the neglected but still grouchily dutiful wife of the serial killer responsible for the dead girls murder. Discovering the dead girls underwear along with that of his other victims in one of her husbands storage bins Ruth burns the piled-up garments in a huge bonfire which becomes almost surreal in its significance after she throws her own clothes into the purifying flames leaving herself luminously naked. Melora (Marcia Gay Harden) is the dead girls mother who ends up befriending her late daughters roommate a prostitute named Rosetta (Kerry Washington)--who in turn enables Melora to discover her own previously unsuspected granddaughter in a seedy day-care center and take her home. Finally the dead girl herself--Brittany Murphys Krista a carefree hard-bitten prostitute--comes to belated life in a flashback involving Rosettas pimp whom she beats up after he abuses her roommate. Krista brings the films gloom-and-doom-laden narrative full circle when she later hitches a ride with Ruths well-mannered husband the serial killer. Mary Steenburgen the mother of another missing daughter rounds out Ms. Moncrieffs female cast of immensely talented actresses of a certain age that currently finds more favor in French movies than in the mostly male-oriented Hollywood product (not to mention its carefully targeted teenage spectators). The connecting male presences in the troubled lives of Ms. Moncrieffs female protagonists are expertly provided by Giovanni Ribisi James Franco Bruce Davison Nick Searcy Josh Brolin Christopher Allen Nelson and Dennis Keifer. It is perhaps no accident that the dead girl a prostitute is provocatively named Krista Like the black Madonna in Children of Men she partakes of a humanistic form of Jesus freakdom. Nonetheless Ms. Moncrieffs ambitious second film is a bit of a disappointment after the promise shown in her more tightly structured debut effort Blue Car (2002) with Agnes Bruckner as a sensitive adolescent who sublimates the pain of her fathers abandonment by writing poetry for her English teacher (David Strathairn) an initially platonic father-figure who eventually--and guiltily--crosses the line that separates teacher and (underage) student yet without destroying either the budding poet or the still-resilient adolescent. These days thanks to the marvels of modern technology one can fairly easily revisit Ms. Moncrieffs Blue Car and Mr. Cuarons Y Tu Mama Tambien to see where both of these talented directors went wrong in 2006. Not Their Best Zhang Yimous Curse of the Golden Flower from a screenplay by Mr. Zhang Wu Nan and Bian Zhihong has been freely adapted from a popular and critically acclaimed 1930s play Thunder Storm by Cao Yu in which the disintegration of an industrial tycoons family is depicted as the inevitable outgrowth of his failed marriage. Thus Curse of the Golden Flower is an operatic period piece with more than its share of martial-arts wizardry uneasily combined with the dangling expansive narrative strands of a 1930s-style family drama. To put a point to it the lavish period costumes operatic mise-en-scene and ceremonial grandeur of Curse of the Golden Flower clashes fatally with the nuanced nastiness of modern marital discord as fueled by the rivalries and hatreds raging among jealous and envious children and stepchildren traumatized by the chasm widening between their homicidally inclined parents. The setting and period is China during the later Tang Dynasty of the 10th century. Golden flowers festoon the halls and courtyards of the Imperial Palace for the Chong Yang Festival--celebrated to this day in China every year on the ninth day of the ninth month September. With Rockettes-like precision Busby Berkeley-style choreographed platoons of courtiers maids and eunuchs sweep and swarm through the palace endlessly cleaning up the place to prepare it for the Chong Yang Festival which is being staged this year ostensibly to celebrate the reunion of the Imperial Family after a long separation. The actual truth concealed behind all of the pomp and ceremony beneath all the blossoming golden chrysanthemums is a spider web of intra-family conspiracy. Inside the palace the Empress (Gong Li) her youngest son Prince Yu (Qin Junjie) and her stepson Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye) await the return of the Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) and Prince Jai (Jay Chou) the middle of three princes. Battle-hardened Jai has been serving his father by leading an army to secure the Empires northern borders and after joining their two armies the Emperor and Jai will march together to the Imperial Palace for the increasingly ominous Chong Yang Festival. To say that all is not well within the palace is a gross understatement. The Empress is fully aware that the Emperor is slowly poisoning her via her prescribed herbal medicine. She knows also that she cannot refuse to drink this strong black liquid without her disobedience being reported back to him. The Empress has other problems as well. She is disturbed to learn that Prince Wan the son of the Emperor and his supposedly deceased first wife plans to depart from the Imperial Palace for a new post in a provincial capital. Unbeknownst to the Emperor Wan has been the Empress secret lover for three years. As the Empress ritualistically continues her seemingly endless embroideries of golden chrysanthemums she closely observes her two sons and her stepson as they maneuver for the succession to the Imperial throne at times murderously. When the Emperor confers with his chief herbalists the Imperial Doctor (Ni Dahong) and the doctors daughter and apprentice Chan (Li Man) we learn that he has recently ordered as an addition to his wifes herbal remedy a black mushroom that will certainly poison her. The plot thickens and darkens like the loathsome herbal liquid the Empress must drink every day. First a mysterious figure in black brings the black mushroom to the Empress to prove that she is being poisoned. When this mysterious figure is apprehended by Prince Wan as a possible assassin she is revealed to be not only the wife of the Emperors physician but also the Emperors first wife whom he has ruthlessly discarded in order to satisfy his dynastic ambitions with his current wife. Meanwhile the Empress hasnt been idle; indeed she has planned a coup detat against the Emperor with her warrior son. Much blood will be shed before the Emperor can finally preside at the Chong Yang Festival--he momentarily triumphant the Empress eternally defiant and all the debris of the bloody carnage carefully swept away by the ever-efficient army of courtiers maids and eunuchs. Gong Li and Zhang Yimou have done much better work before both together and separately in careers that began jointly almost 20 years ago with Red Sorghum (1987). As for the immensely talented Chow Yun Fat as the Emperor I felt that he played his part with too much sympathy-inducing authority to convey all the corrupt ambition at work in this chaotic period in Chinese history.

"Childhoods end is just the beginning - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections Childhoods end is just the beginningmoviesThis is how the world ends Not with a bang but without the whimper of a newborn child.January 5 2007|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie Critic""The world has collapsed"" a video screen informs us and everybody riding on a time-worn London double-decker bus. Images of riots wars terrorist attacks famine and pestilence flicker by.""Only Britain soldiers on.""Women havent been able to have babies for 18 years. The ""youngest child on Earth"" has just been killed. People go through the motions of life and the only ones who weep at the death of ""Baby Diego"" (he was 18) are those who arent grieved out.The human race is dying. Anarchy threatens. Britain is deporting foreigners refugees nicknamed ""fugees"" by the hundreds of thousands. The Renouncers are competing with the Repenters and the Muslims looking to cast supernatural blame.Theo Faron (Clive Owen) does what any sane man would do under those conditions. He drinks. He gambles.Welcome to the dystopia of Children of Men a superior sci-fi thriller and the best doomsday drama since 28 Days Later. Its about a hateful hate-filled world and the political football that one miracle a pregnant woman (Claire-Hope Ashitey) might be.Theo is a recovering activist one of those guys who met his now-ex-wife on the barricades decades before. Hes still pals with the idealistic ultra-liberal Jasper (Michael Caine). But he works a 9-to-5 office job and drinks.And then the ex (Julianne Moore) leader of something called the Fish underground shows up and saddles him with this burden. Get this naive young woman to safety to something called The Human Project. Save the world.The latest film from Alfonso Cuaron who did the best of the Harry Potters (The Prisoner of Azkaban) is a witty downbeat road picture a descent into a world thats taken the ills of today to their logical extreme. Tribalism is rampant. Pollution clouds the skies because really why bother? Whole herds of cattle are burning in pyres victims of genetic tinkering and disease. ""Homeland Security"" covers anything the government is willing to do to keep control. The bombs keep going off.Activist groups are willing to kill to have control of a woman who might be a figurehead. Refugees are armed and bracing for The Uprising.And poor Theo a man without a clear idea of what to do a man without a plan a cause or a gun is trying to save the human race.Its a cool distant film one that only warms up for its final reels. People have stopped caring about each other about themselves. Various lefties warn Theo about his smoking habit. ""Those thingsll kill you.Owens baleful stare says it all. ""Its not working.""Owen is a strong quiet presence in the film playing a man who does a lot of perfectly ordinary things to achieve something extraordinary. Theo is no James Bond. He cant fight doesnt shoot and has few skills that would prepare him for this mission. One daring getaway made up on the fly is practically in slow motion as he tries and tries to roll-start a car.Ashitey makes for a funny flip and downright goofy Earth Mother. Caine relishing the chance to play wacky and noble and the character who handles the foreshadowing burden is a delight.As sci-fi this adaptation of P.D. James novel is a little Blade Runner a little Gattaca with some Handmaids Tale Road Warrior and Equilibrium even. Like the best science fiction it holds a mirror on the present as seen from the future. This is the world were making -- poisoned biologically altered paranoid and violent.At least this is a dystopia with a sense of humor. The odd joke or witty moment pales in comparison to the larger one the very life force at the heart of Children of Men.That joke is this. Those ""nuts"" on the barricades protesting the World Trade Organization the Iraq war pollution genetically altered food overpopulation and over-fishing? Theyre humanitys last best hope.

Theo (Clive Owen) meets with underground opposition leader Julian (Julianne Moore) in Children of Men. Photo Jaap Buitendijk Universal Pictures Children of Men 1 / 2 Back to Gallery A news report blares from a coffee-shop television as Children of Men opens. While huddled Londoners crouch over java a sober announcer describes the death of ""Baby Diego"" the worlds youngest person -- who was 18 years 4 months and 20 days old when he was killed by a disgruntled autograph seeker. This is a remarkable scene for being so unremarkable. If the time were 2027 if the human race had been infertile for 18 years and if Earth had been gripped for decades by war and attendant chaos its easy to imagine an exhausted populace latching onto one reluctant celebrity as a symbol of faith. Its easy to imagine just about everything in Children of Men a film that speaks less of the future than a subtly warped color-drained present preoccupied with terrorism eco-paranoia and institutionalized xenophobia. The brilliance of it lies in the black-plastic garbage bags piled on every corner They signal mundane problems in a speculative context lending everything the look and feel of threadbare realism. The clothes are recognizable (no spangled unitards) the cars are beaters (old Citroens and Renaults outfitted with streamlined touches) and the characters bear humanitys doom with the slouchy-ironic resignation of urban sewer rats. Who else to direct such a thing but Alfonso Cuaron the chafingly edgy realist behind Y tu mama tambien and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban? Cuaron does lowdown takes on high concept better than anyone; no matter what genre he touches he brings grit and loose-limbed humor along with the hand-held camera jangles (Emmanuel Lubezki also shot Y tu mama). And who else to star in it but Clive Owen an actor whose lived-in mug gets handsomer and more exhausted with each film? As Theo an unwitting hero in this apocalyptic fable he plays a government drone whose rebel ex-girlfriend (Julianne Moore perfect as a grimy-glam terrorist) ropes him into a scheme to transport Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to ""the Human Project"" a possibly apocryphal sanctuary devoted to the survival of the species. The big fat whopper of an epiphany is Kees distended belly. Shes eight months pregnant a fact received by Owen and every other witness as little short of miraculous. Theo then devotes himself to Kees safety helping her dodge terrorists and cops on a quest for sanctuary that brims with biblical import and inspired human touches. Nothing much is ever explained -- we never learn what happened why everyones infertile or why Kee isnt -- and the movie ends with screeching abruptness at a moment of unresolved misery and hope. It might remind gaming fans of first-person shooters or vampire fans of 28 Days Later or post-cataclysmic movie fans of Michael Hanekes The Time of the Wolf. (Meanwhile P.D. James fans might pop their corks over the films simplified refitting of her 1992 novel.) But Children of Men weaves its own tale in washed-out blues and grays so well-imagined and fantastically detailed that an escape in stocking feet evolves into a subplot of ill-fitting shoes It may be the only dystopian yarn in which the protagonist tries on a pair of Hush Puppies. Every scene flickers with oblique humor and redolent human touches (will the babys name be Froley or Bazooka?). As an old-dog longhair living in the woods Michael Caine delights and moves. As a crackpot guard with third-person fancies Peter Mullan bristles and scares. ""Syd doesnt want to know"" he says shuttling this newfangled Mary and Joseph. ""Syd doesnt care.""

Although Clive Owens character makes that dazed exclamation in a barn with the surgically abused cows lowing he doesnt mean it quite that way. Or does he? Alfonso Cuarons dystopian tale of sacrifice and miracles set in 2027 suggests there is more than one way to tell a nativity story. When Kee (bright Brit newcomer Clare Hope-Ashitey) gets a kick out of something she remarks ""wicked"" with relish. She doesnt mean it that way either though the smoldering chaos and cold cruelties of this near future make one wonder. Theo is not the only person to swear when they first see Kee. More than 18 years have passed since a woman has become pregnant. Yet in the midst of upheaval in a world gone infertile a child just might be born. And so an immigrant - ""fugee"" - mother must be protected from a xenophobic government. She must be protected too from activists who want to use her and her soon-to-be born child as a rallying symbol in an uprising. Based on a novel by British mystery writer P.D. James ""Children of Men"" is a filmmaking feat. In the midst of mayhem the director of ""Y Tu Mama Tabien"" and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" delivers subtle and jarring images while exploring complex emotional rhythms. He has the exquisite contribution of John Taveners original music ""Fragments of a Prayer."" Of the willfully long shots he and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki use Cuaron says they wanted ""to squeeze the frame to the last of its potential ... to hold the frame unitl theres nothing else we can tell."" Squeeze they do eschewing the hectic editing often used to propel action. On Nov. 16 2027 Londoners are riveted and wrecked by news that the youngest living human has been killed. He was a young man when he died but he was still known throughout the world as ""Baby Diego."" As a knot of people in a cafe stare at the breaking bulletins Theo pushes through and orders a coffee. This is our introduction to our tarnished hero. A former activist Theo is now an apathetic survivor. Owens heavy beckoning mug tilts toward the serious. He has the look of a brooder a doubter. Theo is a good fit. While others wallow in mass grief Theo uses Baby Diegos death as an opportunity to play hooky and visit his chum Jasper (Michael Caine). ""Children of Men"" is a chase flick as dirge as lament. It reeks of the death of goodness. As with many a fine film about the devolution of human culture its permeated with sorrow yet at odds with sentimentality. Loss has grown so perpetual its becomes the prevailing mood. Global infertility makes renewal impossible. The British government has the nation in lockdown and is aggressively expunging illegal immigrants. The rest of the world might be heading toward hell in a handbasket but as the news programs tout ""Britain Soldiers On."" Julianne Moore appears as Julian the head of an underground organization demanding full equal rights for illegal immigrants. Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Tsunami The Aftermath"" ) plays Luke her second in command. Julian and Theo share an activist past. They also had a son together. She gives Theo the opportunity to do the right thing - that and make 5000 pounds sterling. When a car carrying Julian Kee Theo and midwife Miriam is attacked the scene is so abruptly brutal it makes clear ""Children of Men"" will require sacrifice on our parts as well. Form attachments to characters at your emotional peril. Anger and fear are ever present here but sloppy sentiment is nearly extinct. Thank goodness then for Jasper. Looking like John Lennon had he lived to a ripe old age Caines character lives in a pine barren hideaway tending his wife. When Theo Kee and the midwife Miriam (Pam Ferris) make it to Jaspers woodland refuge the pace of camaraderie turns human and humane. It gives nothing away to say the movie ends as it began it with a black screen and telling sounds. Listen closely and you may hear a strangely hopeful requiem for us all.

James book is set in near-future Britain an ominous place where illegal immigrants are corraled for deportation where the government surveils all where the police are a paramilitary operation infiltrating arresting and occasionally killing any person or group opposed to its cause.The very near future.Its hell-in-a-handbasket time. By a cause unknown (carcinogens in the food chain? cell phones?) the female of the species has become infertile. Its been almost 20 years since a baby was born - anywhere. Humanity appears doomed. But this Sceptred Isle perseveres maintaining some semblance of order thanks to the imperial hand (or iron fist) of an aggressively isolationist 10 Downing St. The United Kingdom is a police state.And onto this graffiti-ridden razor-wired landscape comes Theo (Clive Owen) a onetime activist turned ministry bureaucrat who goes through his days reading the paper (yes in 2027 Britain people still consume newsprint) drinking booze and espresso dully hanging on.But in the roiling adrenalized Children of Men Theos life takes a sudden turn abducted by his ex (Julianne Moore) and her masked gang of radicals Theo is asked to secure transit papers for a young mystery woman (Claire-Hope Ashitey). An offshore organization called the Human Project has plans for her. Shootouts bombings secret plots deranged cops and mad hippies follow at breakneck pace.Cuaron the architect behind the best Harry Potter pic (Prisoner of Azkaban) and the sad sexy Mexican road movie Y tu mama tambien has crafted a vision of tomorrow that is recognizably today Think of the news images from war-torn Baghdad of riots in Indonesia and of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and youll have an idea of what Merry Olde England looks like through Cuarons eyes (and camera and amazing art directors).Its not pretty but its powerful.A chase movie a spy movie a futuristic thriller full of colorfully bizarre characters and deftly choreographed stunt work (a roadside confrontation between rebels and police is a marvel of staging photography and editing) Children of Men works on multiple levels - as action and allegory. Owen unshaven and understandably distressed (a car bomb detonates while Theo sips his morning coffee) is great as the accidental hero - a kind of post-apocalyptic Cary Grant running from the deadly crop-sprayer of North By Northwest.In a tremendous cameo Michael Caine appears as Jasper a creaky flower child and political idealist now hidden deep in the countryside with his collection of old vinyl and old memories. Theo on the run with the mystery girl Kee and her ragtag band of minders takes refuge at his dear friends house allowing for a couple of great scenes between Owen and Caine. Chiwetel Ejiofor Danny Huston Peter Mullan and Pam Ferris give memorable turns while Moore she of the quivering lip and push-button crackups lowers the volume - to everyones benefit.Children of Men ends if not abruptly then unexpectedly with a scene thats at once corny hopeful and full of dire question marks. But the fact that Cuaron and company have taken us to this point at high velocity with careening twists and turns and that were still there clutching our arm rests or the seat back in front of us (sorry guy) speaks to the huge accomplishment of this dark terrifying and sometimes very funny film.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor January 5 2007 Save for later Saved ""Children of Men"" is the rare piece of futurism that actually looks and feels like it was taking place years from now - 2027 to be exact. Loosely adapted from a 1992 P.D. James novel and directed by Alfonso Cuaron its a doomsday nightmare that seems all too contemporary.And that contemporaneity is of course the mark of a true apocalyptic vision. Because we dont see ourselves reflected in it the futurism of most sci-fi is not disturbing. Its escapist. But the George Orwell who wrote ""1984"" was thinking of his own era. Likewise Cuaron aided immensely by his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki draws imagery from the here and now. The ravages of Iraq and global terrorism are this films template.Clive Owen plays Theo a former political activist who is now a burned-out functionary for the Ministry of Energy in London. Mankind has become infertile. The world has been pulled apart by sectarian violence and Britain the only country that hasnt devolved into anarchy has closed its borders. The refugees who nevertheless pour in - unaffectionately referred to as ""fugees"" - are captured caged and deported. The country survives as a totalitarian state with omnipresent security police and surveillance cameras. A public service announcement declares ""The world has collapsed. Only Britain soldiers on."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Theo is drawn into a rescue mission engineered by his ex-lover Julian (Julianne Moore) a radical fighting for refugee rights. His job is to spirit Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) an African woman out of the country. He soon discovers shes pregnant. Its been almost 19 years since a child has been born into this world. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Cuaron is one of the most versatile living directors. His first Hollywood film ""A Little Princess"" is a family classic and at the opposite extreme ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is a great coming-of-age sexcapade. His ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the easily best Potter film.""Children of Men"" is unlike anything the director has done before. Much of it was shot hand-held. He stages a couple of sequences notably a terrorist ambush in the countryside that are startlingly sinuous. The horror appears to be happening right in front of our eyes in a single take.The raging despair at the heart of ""Children of Men"" is present right from the beginning in the blasted grayed-out atmosphere and in the mayhem that seems to erupt out of nowhere and everywhere. The hollowed-eyed refugees match up with their captors Both are prisoners of a doomed planet. Harboring no hope for the perpetuation of humankind people fall back on their basest instincts for survival.Theos race to protect Kee becomes all important. He initially takes on the responsibility not only to help Julian but also for the money hell collect. The revelation that Kee is pregnant changes everything. He is fighting for the future and he (and everyone else) knows it.Owen never makes the mistake of playing Theo like an action-adventure stalwart. Near the beginning of the film we see him with his former comrade Jasper (the peerless Michael Caine) a former political cartoonist who lives in the remote countryside outside London in the manner of a hippie squire. Watching these two old friends together we can see how each has made his peace with defeat. And yet circumstances force both men to rise as heroes. Jasper faces up to marauders. Theo a rather ordinary man is suddenly seized with a calling. Thats when his fear becomes palpable.It would have been easy to sentimentalize Kee and her miracle baby but Cuaron never makes that mistake. He knows that for these people survival is not accompanied by a heavenly choir.At times the film is so supercharged that it glosses over the storys thematic richness and turns into a very high-grade action picture. But if thats the worst thing you can say about a movie youre doing all right. The best thing to be said about ""Children of Men"" is that its a fully imagined vision of dystopia. Grade A Rated R for strong violence language some drug use and brief nudity.Sex/Nudity 3 scenes including nudity. Violence 19 scenes. Profanity 72 harsh expressions. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 6 scenes of smoking 7 scenes of drinking 2 scenes with marijuana.

Sexton; Release Date Limited 12/25/2006; Runtime (in minutes) 109; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Universal Posted January 3 2007 -- 1200 AM EST Thrilling important and invigoratingly bleak Children of Men is one of the very best movies to come out in 2006. I think about it still weeks after viewing as scenes of the disintegrating near future envisioned by the prodigiously talented filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron -- the year is 2027 in a ""civilized"" Great Britain barely distinguishable from ruined current-day Iraq -- literally haunt my dreams. Yet to my enduring regret I failed to include Children of Men on my list of last years top 10 movies. So now Ill call it No. 10 with an asterisk. And Ill defend the delay by adding that sometimes leisurely private consideration is a more fitting movie-loving response than instant assessment -- especially when it comes to the power of this prophetic dystopian dazzler by the maker of Y Tu Mama Tambien (as well as the prophetic dystopian dazzler Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). The clamorous competition for attention such a film (unsexy a downer no big-time Oscar prospects) has faced in the onslaught of big-ticket December releases has benefited no one. Not the filmmakers nor the filmgoers never mind us critics. Children of Men is too excellent to be stuffed in at years end as a kind of prestige-project after-dinner mint; its a work of art that deserves a space cleared for its angry nervous beauty. In the pictures scenario set just a calendar page or two ahead of our own the birthrate has dropped to zero as if a mysterious worldwide plague of infertility were the inevitable by-product of societal rot. (A five-man team is credited with wrestling a script from the story broadly based on the book by best-selling author P.D. James.) Apathy has led to privation which in turn has led to conflagrations of lawlessness even in Britain. And Britain has fared better than the rest of the crap world only by wielding a big militaristic stick to keep a semblance of order; the illegal refugees pouring into England are rounded up like -- well like those in images transmitted to us from any number of the worlds current misery sites. Violence and terrorism are all the more disturbing for being so matter-of-fact. With no future to live for the present will not hold. In such a dead zone Theo (Clive Owen) a callous bureaucrat who would have prospered in Brazil (and no one dedicates his good looks to the service of brutish characters better than Owen) just happens to cheat death when a bomb goes off at the crummy joint where he has picked up his morning coffee. Once Theo was an activist who fought the good fight alongside his lover Julian (Julianne Moore again dedicating her elegant delicacy of gesture to the service of a chilly tale). But while Julian continues her underground activities on behalf of revolution (her fellow anarchists call themselves the Fishes as they swim against the current) Theo has long since given up settling for thick-skinned cynicism as a defense against despair relieved only by occasional visits (and drug binges) with an old hippie friend (Michael Caine a gas in Jesus hair). All that begins to change though with a request just this side of a bribe from Julian and her compadres for Theos assistance in spiriting one particular refugee out of the country. Because the young ""fugee"" woman called Kee (newcomer Clare-Hope Ashitey) is key indeed Shes pregnant a modern-day Madonna ripe with the possibility of the planets first new human life in 18 years. And so Theo who sticks his neck out for no one becomes involved and like Rick in Casablanca helps obtain precious letters of transit to a new tomorrow. Theres certainly a flash of George Orwell and a glint of Blade Runner in such glitteringly downbeat prognostications. But what sets the picture apart from its poli-sci-fi forebears is Cuarons unique full-throttle storytelling talent for blending propulsiveness of staging and seriousness of political content into one urgent piece; theres no gap between entertainment and art no lulls to make room for flights of philosophy. With audacious cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (The New World) and production design by Geoffrey Kirkland and Jim Clay Children of Men is never so reassuringly out there in the future that we can comfortably ignore its anxious relevant nowness. My biggest movie-loving anxiety these days is that this great dark specimen of fine 2006 filmmaking will be lost too soon in the jumble of last years more classifiable classy fare.

D. James novel.   Credit PHILIP BURKE Something is afoot in Mexican filmmaking. That much is clear from three movies of the past year ""Babel"" which came out in October and now ""Children of Men"" and ""Pans Labyrinth"" both of them released for the holiday. The first was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu the second by Alfonso Cuaron and the third by Guillermo del Toro (one of whose producers was Cuaron). Even if none of the films are to your taste you cannot miss something forthright in their attitude--a willingness to entangle themselves in mystery and to flit across established borders both of geography and of genre. All three directors have previously filmed in their native Mexico bequeathing us works such as ""Amores Perros"" ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and ""Cronos"" but the urge to see the world or to elaborate on the angle at which they see it seems lately to have consumed them. ""Children of Men"" based on the novel by P. D. James takes place in Britain in 2027. Cuaron is no stranger to the British backdrop having made ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" but the new film eschewing magic casts a more noisome spell. The land served up for us is a stew of anxiety and intolerance seething with casual savagery and overlaid by a rancid sky. Some of the most enduring details are glanced at in passing a yellowing gush from a waste pipe at the edge of a muddy field or the projectiles that bystanders hurl at the caged windows of a train. On board is Theo (Clive Owen) once a political activist now a deflated bureaucrat. In Owens hangdog half-snarling expression we quickly sense a man who has had just about enough of life. The whole planet in fact has had enough there is mass infertility and the youngest person on earth we learn from a news report on TV has died. He was eighteen years old. This is an extraordinary premise for a film--a childless world--and it will leave some viewers feeling restive and underinformed. How they will want to know did this catastrophe arise? To Cuaron however the first rule of storytelling is Go with the given. Dont waste space on deep background and dont delay the action with a preface--remember Ben Kingsley intoning like a royal robot at the start of Steven Spielbergs ""A.I.""? Cuaron respects his audience presuming that we are grown up enough (or ground down enough) to work out the horrors for ourselves. ""Only Britain soldiers on"" we hear in government announcements. Slowly we realize that they are trumpeting a siege mentality; immigrants are being rounded up and imprisoned and to harbor them is a criminal act. (If this rings a bell among current worriers so much the better.) We also see commercials for something called Quietus but what is it? Mineral water? Migraine cure? Suddenly the truth snaps into place its a suicide drug. Hence the nasty taste of Hamlet in the brand name (""He himself might his quietus make / With a bare bodkin"") and the chill of the advertising slogan ""You decide when."" Nobody is being born and everybody picks a time to die. One day Theo is bundled into a van and taken to meet not as you expect the secret police but an old girlfriend Julian (Julianne Moore) who still tends the subversive flame. She and a gang of fellow-dissidents want Theo to use his contacts personal or professional to get hold of transit papers--the only guarantee of safe passage these days--for a young woman named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey). Transported to the countryside Theo goes into a barn to meet Kee. Without warning you see on his exhausted face a look of purest wonderment for Kee is great with child. So thats why Universal chose to release the film on Christmas Day. The rest of ""Children of Men"" is a scruffy panting escape flick with Theo retrieving his sense of purpose and guiding the expectant mother to safety offshore away from the powers that be. Kee herself of course is the only power that is; without her all that humanity can look forward to is one big bodkin. There is a relentless sequence late in the movie when the two of them are smuggled into an immigrants camp on the south coast from where they plan to pick up a boat. Within the camp civilization has all but rotted away and when the Army arrives to restore order we get a pitched battle between the feral and the near-fascist (what a choice) filmed with such unbroken urgency--there are blurred spots of blood on the lens--that you may want to duck under your seat and wait for the hell to subside. When it does so the peace is immediate. Look up and you will see Kee cradling the baby to whom she has just given birth stepping calmly through ranks of armed men--disarmed now by the sight and the cry of something that no one has witnessed since the year 2009. The idea of the world redeemed by a helpless infant is a specifically Christian one but here it shines out from a landscape that is bitterly stripped of faith. The people I know who have seen ""Children of Men"" have admired its grip but they had to be dragged to the theatre; its a film that you need to see not a film that you especially want to. I guess it should it be logged as sci-fi yet by 2027 mankind is clearly beyond the reach of science and the roughened pace of the film--photographed by Emmanuel Lubezki--leans away from fiction and toward the natural stutter of reportage. When a bomb explodes in Tony Scotts ""Deja Vu"" it is tensely prepared for and filmed with a lingering gloat; when a bomb explodes in ""Children of Men"" it bursts from nowhere on a dreary street. Even if you dont buy the main conceit the scumbled texture of the movie makes it feel not just plausible but recognizable and Cuaron takes care never to paint the future as consolingly different. Theo doesnt go to work in an aluminum-foil catsuit with a diagonal zip; he wears a jacket and tie. And where the cars of ""Blade Runner"" hovered in the ruined air the vehicles here still trundle along on roads. The Britain of twenty years time in short will be just like the Britain of today but worse. The sole survivors--the only citizens not to have caved in to despair--are shaggy old-timers like Jasper (Michael Caine) a friend of Theos who saw it coming. He lives in a forest hideaway smokes weed plays loud music and still finds something to laugh about. Such is the moral of this tough destabilizing film the hippies were right all along. Reversing the flow of time we come to 1944 and the rustling backwoods of Spain. Here as related by Guillermo del Toro in ""Pans Labyrinth"" Francos army is plucking out the remnants of the opposition--republican diehards who dwell among the trees emerging only to fight. We could be watching an update on the tales of Robin Hood or a foreshadowing of Jasper in ""Children of Men."" Into this remoteness comes Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) a girl of ten who has travelled with her widowed mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to meet her new stepfather. He is an immaculate sadist by the name of Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) who commands the local military outpost and who has ordered Carmen to join him; she is carrying their first child who will be born the Captain decrees in the old house where he is quartered. Ofelia not surprisingly feels surplus to requirements and she duly drifts off into the surrounding grounds as though into sleep. Indeed for much of the film we cannot tell whether Ofelias adventures like those of Alice in Wonderland are rooted in the real or secreted by her own imaginings. We know she is a bookish creature and what ensues has the rich scent of a fairy tale. Entering a stone labyrinth she walks down spiral steps into a subterranean cavern and meets a faun (Doug Jones)--""very old very tall and smelling of earth"" she says. He has the hooves of a shire horse and a pair of horns that could double as musical instruments. He bears about as much resemblance to Mr. Tumnus his fellow-hybrid from the pages of C. S. Lewis as the late Jack Palance bore to Woody Allen. Like any self-respecting beast of legend the faun sets our heroine three tasks. These entail crawling into the roots of trees fitting keys to locks letting fall drops of blood and other staples of a Freudian adolescence. Ivana Baquero her face both credulous and wise before its time seems ideally poised between the childish and the adult and that makes her a fine successor to Ana Torrent whose youthful performances in ""The Spirit of the Beehive"" (1973) and ""Raise Ravens"" (1976) are indispensable to the cinema of modern Spain. Like those great films ""Pans Labyrinth"" needs a child at its heart because it is partly about a nation striving to define itself and confronted by a confusion of paths. To Captain Vidal the way is clear ""I want my son to be born in a new clean Spain"" he says in a declaration of Fascist fatherhood. The cleanliness continues as he tortures an enemy suspect then washes the blood off in a shower of rain. No wonder del Toro turns his camera downward to the soil. The mud that Ofelia gets all over her best dress in which she was meant to greet a party of adults is a squelching badge of honor. One virtue of ""Pans Labyrinth"" is its sound design which discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small supercharged noises the creak of the Captains leather gloves as he flexes his fists the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter or Ofelias teeth biting into a succulent grape. More haunting still is the howl of a mandrake root ""a plant that dreams of being human"" in the words of the faun. Del Toro as he proved in ""The Devils Backbone"" (2001) is enthralled by such transformations plant to human man to beast war to uneasy peace. He is helped by Sergi Lopez to whom the script offers little more than monstrosity but who somehow turns Vidal into the most mystifying presence of all; his resilience to pain as shown when he stitches up a knife wound to his own mouth is not so far from the courage required by Ofelia in her descent to the underworld. The question is do the two halves of the movie fit together? What does Vidals attempt to suppress the freedom fighters have to do with fauns and giant toads? There is thank heavens no neat allegorical match. Take the long-fingered hairless figure whom Ofelia finds in her nightmare and who as if in homage to Bunuel screws his eyeballs into his palms and holds up his hands in order to see and pursue her. He does not represent a historical person or embody a single threat; he simply conjures an atmosphere of cannibalistic fear and thus feels gruesomely right for an age of schism and feud. The odd thing is that for all this adhesive detail del Toro lets the fantasy slip slightly from his grasp preferring to focus on the brutalities of fact. By the end the three tasks seem of limited consequence whereas the fate of Vidal--and of the steel-willed housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) who has taken Ofelia to her bosom--tightens to a merciless climax. So smartly has del Toro thought his fable through and so graceful is his grasp of visual rhyme that to pick holes in it seems mean; yet ""Pans Labyrinth"" is perhaps more dazzling than involving--I was too busy reading its runes and clues as it were to be swept away. It is I suspect a film to return to like a country waiting to be explored a maze of dead ends and new life.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

But it is. Thats the secret at the center of Guillermo del Toros magnificent Spanish-language film which interweaves the girls gothic imaginings and the life shes forced to live in a remote Spanish military outpost in the 1940s when Francos troops have all but crushed the Loyalist resistance. Ofelia has an evil stepfather the outposts commander Captain Vidal. Her inner and outer worlds are populated by monsters including the fey faun of the title. Both worlds demand unquestioning obedience force her to decide on sketchy evidence who can or cant be trusted and require more courage than she may possess. ENLARGE Last week I put ""Pans Labyrinth"" on my list of the years 10 best films and marveled albeit briefly at its dark enchantments. Now its time to marvel in some detail at the wizardry of Mr. del Toro and at the somber beauty of his new film in which Ofelia is played by a remarkable young Spanish actress named Ivana Baquero. (I loved one scene among many good ones in which she takes on a monstrous toad that in the fashion of Francos forces draining life from the nation is draining all energy from a giant fig tree.) The director who is known for such stylish horror flicks as ""Cronos"" ""Mimic"" and ""Hellboy"" is part of a triumvirate of brilliant Mexican filmmakers that includes Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu and Alfonso Cuaron. In ""Pans Labyrinth"" Mr. del Toro returns to a theme he first addressed five years ago with ""The Devils Backbone."" In that film which pretty much followed the rules of the horror genre echoes of the Spanish civil war resonate within the walled confines of an orphanage. This time however the fantasy elements -- enhanced by the judicious yet spectacular use of digital effects -- transcend conventional horror though as children discover and adults forget horror is a basic ingredient of classic fairy tales. By doing so they amplify the evil conveyed by Sergi Lopezs stunning performance as the fascist commander. The result of the intricate interplay is a fairy tale for adults that is violent sometimes shocking yet utterly engrossing. And eerily instructive; it deepens our emotional understanding of fascism and of rigid ideologys dire consequences. ENLARGE Ivana Baquero plays a girl forced to live in a remote military outpost in Pans Labyrinth Theres a sense of all elements coming together here for Guillermo del Toro and his colleagues the splendid Mexican cinematographer Guillermo Navarro who has worked with him before; the production designer Eugenio Caballero; the sound designer Martin Hernandez; Doug Jones another veteran of del Toro films who plays both the faun and the Pale Man; and Javier Navarette who wrote the original music. Ofelias only human confidante a servant named Mercedes is played by Maribel Verdu who was the lovely mercurial Luisa in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien."" Once again her beauty is touching but Luisas mercury has been replaced by Mercedess tempered steel. Notes on a Scandal"" The two London teachers played with glorious gusto by Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett in ""Notes on a Scandal"" are lonelier than life which can get very lonely. Theyre also bigger than life and lots more vivid in their obsessions. Dame Judi is Barbara Covett a stern soul in a frumpy body and a closet lesbian whose closest companion is Portia her cat until her secondary school hires a new art teacher Ms. Blanchetts Sheba Hart. The unhappily married Sheba is a troubled soul in a preposterously gorgeous body which shes soon baring and eagerly giving to a fifteen-year-old student named Steven. (Hes played by Andrew Simpson and wears a callow smirk.) Parallel obsessions then Shebas heedless passion for her student and Barbaras mad fixation on Sheba which grows ever madder after Barbara discovers Shebas criminal dalliance with an under-age partner. The question posed by the movie with ever greater shrillness is whose behavior is more predatory. ENLARGE Ben Wishaw and Karoline Herfurth in Perfume ""Notes on a Scandal"" was directed by Richard Eyre a man of the theater who obviously adores actors and acting and adapted by the playwright Patrick Marber from Zoe Hellers celebrated novel. I was resistant to the broadband misanthropy of Mr. Marbers ""Closer"" and hes at it again; taken at face value these two women are simply despicable. But the screenplay has a bracing tincture of Grand Guignol and nothing is simple when the two women are played by a couple of superlative actresses who clearly delight in one another. Cate Blanchett shot like a visiting angel by the masterful cinematographer Chris Menges lights Shebas transgressions with a flame-throwers fire while Judi Dench takes Barbara beyond ""Fatal Attraction"" into new realms of crinkle-eyed cruelty. And makes her solitude convincingly toxic in the bargain. Perfume The Story of a Murderer ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer"" weaves a sensual spell of extraordinary delicacy then sustains it -- up to a point. Tom Tykwers elaborate film version of the Patrick Suskind novel concerns an orphan Jean-Baptiste Grenouille who is born in the streets of 18th Century Paris with a singular gift -- a preternaturally acute sense of smell. When Grenouille grows up and discovers the wonders of perfume he becomes a serial killer -- a sort of Jack the Sniffer -- who murders women not out of any overt sexual urge but because he seeks to capture their essence in a literal eau de femme. Mr. Tykwer is a director of distinction -- his films include ""Run Lola Run"" ""The Princess and the Warrior"" and ""Heaven"" (which was distinguished by Cate Blanchetts formidable performance.) His work in ""Perfume"" is audacious often elegant and the films strong cast includes Alan Rickman Rachel Hurd-Wood Dustin Hoffman doing an amusing turn as a Parisian perfumer and Ben Wishaw as Grenouille whose spectacular rise and epic fall suggest the trajectory of an anti-Christ. Once youve seen ""Perfume"" youre unlikely to forget it. But once the movie broke its spell and the story turned silly -- ""Perfume"" is very long -- I found myself thinking not of elixirs or even pheromones but of Jimmy Durante who would point to his fabled schnozzola and say gleefully ""The nose knows."" Children of Men ENLARGE Clive Owen in Children of Men Seldom does a film convey as stark and riveting a vision as the one that unfolds in ""Children of Men"" a dystopian drama starring Clive Owen and directed by Alfonso Cuaron. (The cinematographer was Emmanuel Lubezki and the production was designed brilliantly by Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland.) And seldom are the director his actors and their audience sandbagged by a script of such ineptitude. The time is 2027 and the place is England but an England that has become an armed camp of terrorist bands and unrelieved bleakness where fascist police hold hordes of illegal immigrants in giant cages. ""The world has collapsed"" a voice intones on TV. ""Only Britain soldiers on."" The cause of the collapse is clear and apparently intractable -- world-wide infertility and loss of hope; no baby has been born for 18 years. Then almost miraculously a pregnant young woman appears and its the task of Clive Owens Theo a former radical turned morose bureaucrat to shepherd her to the sanctuary of a waiting ship owned by a shadowy -- but good-shadowy -- group called The Human Project. Well never know if their mythic quest might have made an accessible movie for this one offers characters as bleak as its setting -- the sole exception being Michael Caine in a role one size larger than a cameo -- and makes a murky cipher of the plot. What is going on in all those shadows? Whats supposed to happen once Theo and his fertile charge reach the ship? The bloated adaptation of P.D. Jamess thoughtful compact novel is credited if you can call it that to five writers. They were too many or too few. DVD TIP In ""An Affair of Love"" (1999) a French-language film that identifies its lovers only as Him and Her Sergi Lopezs charming young Spaniard answers a personals ad placed by an older French woman played by Nathalie Baye who proposes ""une affaire pornographique"" (which was the original title). Please jump to no conclusions. The affair is anything but pornographic and the movie directed by Frederic Fonteyne from a script by Philippe Blasband is an unexpected delight.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures) Photo Universal Pictures Protect that pregnant woman -- shes the future of humanity 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Children of Men Science-fiction drama. Starring Clive Owen Michael Caine Julianne Moore and Claire-Hope Ashitey. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) You get the feeling watching Alfonso Cuarons previous big budget efforts -- ""Great Expectations"" and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" -- that he directed the movies while chained to one of his executive producers. Flashes of his vision were allowed to come through as long as he embraced Hollywood conventions enough to ensure the studio made its money back. ""Children of Men"" is Cuarons run for freedom with a riveting story fantastic action scenes and acting so universally solid that even the dogs perform masterfully under his direction. But technique is what makes the film exceptional and a dark horse candidate for best movie of the year. Cuaron aims his not-so-steady cam for marathon stretches so it seems as if the movie takes place on one big tracking shot. In the beginning the audience experience is like being on a theme park ride until the novelty is gone and you become a bystander to the fate of mankind. ""Children of Men"" also comes in under the wire to give the Asimov and Philip K. Dick crowd three consecutive years with an outstanding science-fiction film offering. When you throw in ""Primer"" (2004) and ""Serenity"" (2005) the genre hasnt been this strong since Ridley Scott was still fascinated with aliens and replicants. ""Blade Runner"" is one knee-jerk comparison for ""Children of Men"" but the movie has a tone thats closer to ""1984"" with a pace thats reminiscent of the best moments in ""The Road Warrior"" (or if you play video games Half Life 2). The story begins with Theo (Clive Owen) a white-collar drone in 2027 London. The film quickly establishes that no children have been born in more than 18 years that the rest of the world is worse off than Britain and that the governments anti-immigration stance has the country on the edge of civil war. Theo was an activist once but has little time for anything except his pain -- until he gets pulled into an attempt to usher the only pregnant woman on the planet to safety. Michael Caine is both fun and dignified as Jasper a hippie type who listens to the oldies (including Radiohead) but still has the activist fire that Theo hasnt summoned for years. Julianne Moore is a rebel leader and Claire-Hope Ashitey stands out as Kee the future of humanity in her third trimester. While its best to know as little as possible about this movie going into the theater the story is so fast-paced that you wont be thinking about this review or any other. What Cuaron has done with the action in ""Children of Men"" cant be overstated. After a relatively calm first half hour the movie goes from zero to 80 with an escape-the-mob sequence that is every bit as tense and exciting as the T. rex scene in ""Jurassic Park."" Except Cuaron has the element of surprise and a voyeuristic filmmaking technique that makes each moment more gripping than the last. Five screenwriters (including Cuaron) and original ""Children of Men"" author P.D. James put a lot of thought into this future with constant reference to the ramifications of current events. But the special effects are kept in the background serving the story rather than distracting from it. ""Children of Men"" morphs into a movie with epic scale but its never showy or excessive. Ask yourself at the end ""How many of the good guys even carried a gun?"" Only at the finish line when the audience has a chance to take a breath and evaluate the final hour of constant movement are questions raised with the plot. Repeated viewings will be needed to figure out if all the pieces fit -- which should determine whether the film becomes a cult favorite or full-blown classic. Either way its the work of a director striving for his creative peak and a movie that will not be forgotten any time soon. -- Advisory This movie contains profanity violence drug use a few gory scenes and Michael Caine doing the ""pull my finger"" joke.

In the spellbinding Children of Men his best film to date Cuaron 45 fills every frame with his passion and intellect. Heres a movie that grabs you hard pops your eyes provokes your mind and ultimately lifts your spirits. As director and co-writer Cuaron takes on a 1992 novel by P.D. James set in 2027 in battle-battered England the only country left to soldier on in the face of massive terrorism immigrant invasion and global infertility (no child has been born since 2009). The death of Baby Diego at eighteen the youngest living person has caused a period of national mourning. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> Hope is the first casualty among survivors who include Theo (Clive Owen) a former activist playing out his days as a bureaucrat for the Ministry of Energy. Owens powerfully implosive performance lets us see past the barriers Theo has erected around his emotions. Theo is a shell of a man until his former lover Julian (Julianne Moore) begs him to help the Fishes underground rebels dedicated to aiding refugees called fugees who are regularly captured tortured and kept in cages. Since he and Julian share the sorrow of having had a son who died Theo agrees to slip a fugee named Kee (the remarkable newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey) past the police to find safety with the utopian Human Project. But when Kees secret is revealed -- shes eight months pregnant -- she and everyone who dares to side with her become targets for special-interest groups of conflicting and sometimes lethal motives. Those motives can be maddeningly unclear at times. But a second viewing which Children of Men richly rewards deepens our understanding. Cuaron invoking shattered landscapes from Beirut to Baghdad is dedicated to locating shards of humanity among the ruins. That he does not just in the person of Jasper (a hilarious and heartbreaking Michael Caine) a former political cartoonist now devoted to weed rap music and sticking it to the system but in the small details that measure what our planet has lost. Is it possible to capture the terrible absence of a world without children? Cuaron does it. His chief collaborator is director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki a weaver of visual miracles. No movie in the last year is more redolent of sorrowful beauty and exhilarating action. You dont just watch the scene (shot with a hand-held camera) in which Theo Kee and other passengers jammed in a car are attacked from all sides -- you live inside it ducking each fresh ferocious assault. The technique disappears to envelop you in the moment. Thats Cuarons magic and its exhilarating. Im not usually one for political fables that include symbols such as a ship called Tomorrow. But Cuaron has a gift only the greatest filmmakers share He makes you believe. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

"Rad Tidings Cuarons Daring Children of Men washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Rad Tidings Cuarons Daring Children of Men Clive Owen and Julianne Moore deliver accomplished performances in ""Children of Men"" set in 2027 London. (By Jaap Buitendijk -- Universal Studios) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Monday December 25 2006 Its altogether appropriate that ""Children of Men"" an audacious exhilarating futuristic thriller by Alfonso Cuaron should open Christmas Day. A bleak portrait of a dystopian future set against a backdrop of infertility totalitarian politics and death it plays like a nativity story for our age a spirited humanistic message as well as a welcome ray of hope for the future of cinema itself. ""Im sure when people walk out of the theater if you ask if they liked the movie they wont know what to tell you"" Cuaron said during a recent visit to Washington. ""Probably theyll say Oh I dont think so. "" Thats fine by the filmmaker -- who came to international attention with his 2001 film ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and later with ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" -- as long as theyre thinking about it the next morning. ""The only films that matter now"" he said ""are the movies that begin when the lights come on."" A loose adaptation of a P.D. James novel ""Children of Men"" stars Clive Owen as Theo a former political activist turned bureaucrat in 2027 London a city that is the last outpost of the closest thing to civilization in a world gripped by pandemics environmental destruction and a worldwide immigration crisis. True to his British roots Theo is leading a life of quiet desperation receiving occasional nostalgic jolts of idealistic fervor during visits to his old lefty friend Jasper (a marvelous Michael Caine) when he is suddenly paid a visit by Julian (Julianne Moore) his former lover. Working with an underground organization that tries to help immigrants avoid the prison camps that the tight little island has set up Julian has a job for Theo involving the transport of a young woman named Kee (newcomer Clare-Hope Ashitey). Theo refuses until money is discussed and soon he has embarked on a countrywide chase in which the goal is nothing less than the survival of the human race. If this all sounds like ""Blade Runner"" by way of Margaret Atwood think again. ""Children of Men"" presents such a masterly use of cinematic grammar such a nuanced use of present-day tropes and such a subversive recasting of the conventional action hero (Owen wears flip-flops through most of the movie) that it feels altogether new. Working with his longtime cinematographer Emmanuel ""Chivo"" Lubezki Cuaron creates the most deeply imagined and fully realized world to be seen on screen this year not to mention bravura sequences that bring to mind names like Orson Welles and Stanley Kubrick. Together Cuaron and Lubezki decided on a radical visual design for ""Children of Men"" one that eschews close-ups (you wont find one in the movie) and instead creates a series of detail-packed tableaux in which figure and ground share equal weight. The result is a frame-by-frame essay not on the future but on the past and present with a dizzying array of references from Goya to Pink Floyd to Abu Ghraib. ""Chivo used to say all the time We cannot afford one single frame without a comment on the state of things "" Cuaron explained. ""The story of this movie is just the coat hanger. Whats important is the fabric that youre going to hang."" The approach he said was the same one the team used in ""Y Tu Mama"" wherein ""the social environment is as important as character."" Aside from its chilling familiarity (""I told the art department Stop imagining. Its not about make-believe its about referencing "") what will leave filmgoers slack-jawed in ""Children of Men"" are two scenes one a 12-minute car ride that looks as if it was shot in one take (and involves an amazing stunt involving Owen Moore and a ping-pong ball) and a chase scene through an embattled refugee camp that was shot in a 10-minute uninterrupted tracking shot. So seamlessly are they woven into the narrative of the film that it may take viewers a moment to realize just what they are witnessing. Cuaron credits the triumph of that final scene to Owen who had to respond to unexpected accidents in the background and time himself accordingly. ""It was the wisdom of Clive to be aware of Okay should I pause here? How long should I pause before everybody starts getting completely bored? Or Wow that cue didnt happen -- what should I do? "" All the while Owen -- who along with the rest of the cast delivers a performance every bit as accomplished as the film theyre in -- keeps the audience with him upping the emotional stakes with each step. ""If things go right"" Cuaron said referring to the scenes mix of choreography and spontaneity ""thats what youre praying for."" Its hard to describe ""Children of Men"" as a feel-good movie. Its setting is too demoralized its palette too denuded and its conclusion too mournful for that. Still Cuaron doesnt let despair win the day and if some people walk out of the theater not knowing quite what to think others -- those who care deeply about filmmaking in all its technical and expressive potential -- will be walking on air. Children of Men (106 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong violence profanity some drug use and brief nudity.

James dystopian novel may be the bleakest movie youll ever want to see twice. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News ""Children of Men"" takes place in 2027 in the grayest London imaginable in a world where humans have lost the ability to reproduce. (The youngest person alive is 18.) The streets are plastered with literature entreating native Britons to smoke out and turn in illegal immigrants In a world thats gone to hell no country can afford generosity to outsiders. Terrorism and war have destroyed whole nations. Britain soldiers on but for those who just cant take it anymore suicide is encouraged Theres even a special government-sanctioned drug with its own Lunesta-style commercial presenting death as a dream state you can just drift into a vast improvement on the suffocating present. ""Children of Men"" directed by Alfonso Cuaron and based on P.D. James 1992 dystopian novel is the bleakest movie Ive ever wanted to see twice. Coming nearly 15 years after James novel it takes into account world events that she could never have dreamed of. Yet the picture doesnt so much build dread as smolder with it as if wed landed on a scorched broken world still desperately trying to throw off some warmth. And that right there is the Cuaron touch The director of movies like ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" pictures that radiate joy (even if in places they harbor their share of darkness) Cuaron at first seems like an odd choice to direct a pessimistic meditation on a world without children. But Cuaron is really the perfect choice A filmmaker so responsive to joy and pleasure is our best guide to a world in which those essentials have gone missing. (If the picture had been made by say Lars von Trier a filmmaker who fears for humankind but doesnt care much for people a dystopia would just be business as usual.) ""Children of Men"" is a solemn haunting picture but its also a thrilling one partly because of the sheer bravado with which its made. It left me feeling more fortified than drained. Cuaron the most openhearted of directors prefers to give rather than take away. Clive Owen plays Theo a former activist who for reasons that become clear as the story moves forward has given up on the idea of change. With his weary eyes and stubborn perpetual 5 oclock shadow Theo has the look of a man who has just been pulled through a keyhole. In the movies first half-hour were given bits of his past to piece together for ourselves. We meet his close friend and confidant a raffish perennial hippie named Jasper (Michael Caine) who seems to know more about him than anyone. Jasper lives in seclusion with his wife a former journalist who has been in a catatonic state for years after having been tortured by MI5. (We pick up that information as the camera scans on old newspaper clippings an example of the subtlety with which Cuaron works here and of the movies point of view In this world its a given that democratic governments torture citizens who dissent.) Suddenly and not accidentally Theo becomes reunited with Julian (Julianne Moore) his one-time estranged lover who hasnt given up on this despairing world as he has. A radical whos fighting for a nearly hopeless cause she forces Theo to help her. The other players in this serpentine drama include Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor in an elegant unsettling performance) an aggressive comrade of Julians; Miriam (the wonderful Pam Ferris) a watchful wary presence whose job becomes clear as the story unfolds; and a sullen (at least at first) young girl named Kee (the vibrant Claire-Hope Ashitey) whose very name suggests how important she might be to humankinds future. The plot of ""Children of Men"" is worked out intelligently and the writers wisely avoid overt doomy futuristic slogans. (Theres no population crisis when it comes to this movies screenwriting credits They list a total of five writers including Cuaron and his writing partner Timothy J. Sexton.) Cuaron draws some mild present-day political parallels The buses used to haul immigrants off to crowded refugee camps have ""Homeland Security"" emblazoned across the side (although in this story theres enough blame for the mess the world is in to go around). Cuaron has structured the movie beautifully and its craftsmanship is evident in thousands of small touches -- as well as in the very things Cuaron doesnt do. Each scene is cut at precisely the right point not a hairline too soon or too late. (Caine in particular gives a deeply resonant performance and the movies editing serves him beautifully in several crucial scenes; we see all we need to see and yet Cuaron always allows his characters their privacy and their dignity.) The action sequences are tense and distinctive worked out to the smallest most precise detail. Their clarity is jolting particularly in the context of the noisy messes we so often see in contemporary action movies; that distinctness helps build the pictures mood of muted terror. You Might Also Like The Cuaron touch is everywhere in ""Children of Men."" This is a world without children but not without animals People treat their pet dogs and cats not necessarily as child substitutes but as loyal companions in this cheerless environment. In this upside-down inside-out London country life has blurred with city life At one point Theo enters a deserted school and startles when he hears a rustling noise -- only to see a deer stumbling in that specifically deerlike crazy-graceful way across a hallway. Sheep cruise the city streets as simultaneously confused and oblivious in the city as they are in the country; hens cluck-cluck through war zones. The animals in ""Children of Men"" represent the one note of stability in the world -- apparently theyre still able to reproduce as if in their innocence theyve escaped the cruel fate assigned to humans by the gods. Its a measure of Cuarons innate decency that he doesnt milk pathos by making bad things happen to animals; the subtext is that the humans here are suffering enough for everyone. The suffering of humans is everywhere although the actors are so in tune with Cuarons mood and approach that they never overstate the case. They make us feel the weight theyre carrying without grinding us down. Moore gives a performance thats almost medievally grave Her delicate beauty notwithstanding shes unnervingly tenacious like a fearless warrior saint you might see depicted in an ancient stained-glass window. And Owen gives what may be the finest performance of his career (among many terrific ones) His Theo so beaten down and disillusioned when we first meet him evolves into a man of action -- but his transformation doesnt have the sentimental gleam of say Bogarts in ""Casablanca."" This performance is rawhide-tough but nuanced too. (And its one of the movies strange charming fillips that nearly all the animals in ""Children of Men"" even the grouchiest guard dogs gravitate toward Theo; his somber demeanor seems to attract and calm them.) Even in a picture where the smallest gears all work perfectly and harmoniously Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography is a unifying and galvanizing force. Lubezkis credits include ""The New World"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"" as well as several of Cuarons pictures (including the unfairly overlooked ""Great Expectations"" and the wondrous ""A Little Princess""). Hes one of the finest cinematographers working and ""Children of Men"" may surpass even the astonishing work he has already done. Its something of a trend now for filmmakers to use grayed-out desaturated colors and it can be an effective technique. But Lubezkis color tones are something else again Here even though hes working in a muted sober palette the colors still look vital and not simply tired. Even his graphite and smoke-silver futuristic London certainly not a place where youd want to take a vacation has a wary beaten-down beauty as if the city itself were haunted by memories of what it used to be. In ""Children of Men"" nature and civilization never comfortable bedmates have completely stopped speaking to each other. And if doing ""the natural thing to do"" no longer results in babies then what is there left to do? Lubezkis camera often in long unbroken takes shows us crumbling city buildings where people cluster together clinging to whatever life they have left. But at one point he also aims his camera up toward the sky through a stand of tall trees their branches creaking in the indecisive wind. Is this an image of pure desolation or a wordless invocation? ""Children of Men"" shows us a world where angels fear to tread and babies have stopped coming too. But theres always the hope that the right lullaby could bring them back.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer Opens today ""Children of Men"" with Clive Owen Julianne Moore and Michael Caine. Directed by Alfonso Cuarn based on the novel by P.D. James. Rated R for strong violence language some drug use and brief nudity. 109 minutes. Several theaters. Imagine a country where the government rounds up and cages immigrants who desperately want in terrorists bomb the joint where you get your morning coffee and activists are as ruthless as the oppressive government they fight. Also its been nearly 20 years since any babies were born on Earth. Thats the ultra-bleak world of Alfonso Cuarons ""Children of Men"" which looks a lot like here and now but takes place in 2027 England. I dont know what I expected from the director of ""Y tu mama tambien"" and the third Harry Potter kiddie flick but this dystopian masterpiece of misery kept me wound up for hours after the credits rolled. Its got a controversial and thought-provoking premise action scenes that equal anything in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and a ragged performance from Clive Owen thatll make you glad he didnt squander his talents on the James Bond series. Owen plays Theo Faron a former activist turned utter burnout government bureaucrat. He numbs himself to the palpable hopelessness of humanitys imminent extinction with a healthy dose of hooch in his morning java and trips to the secluded country house of his old hippie pal Jasper (Michael Caine) -- a lovable fascist-hater who grows primo weed and tends to his catatonic wife. The world turns another shade bleaker after news reports of the death of the worlds youngest person -- a 19-year-old. And then Theo gets jogged out of his stupor by contact from an ex (Julianne Moore). Unlike Theo she went from activist to extremist and offers to pay him a good-size lump of cash to get transit papers for a young woman (Clare-Hope Ashitey) important to the radicals. Hes reluctant bitter sardonic. But a sight forces Theo to pick up his jaw come out of his stupor and risk everything to get the girl to safety her bulging belly. Like the best science fiction -- or speculative fiction or whatever you prefer -- ""Children"" comments on current events and in a way that would make Rod Serling need a cigarette. Cuaron keeps everything realistic so that no hokey ""Logans Run"" nonsense can pull you out of the story for an instant. Its a near-future where the cars look just a little different and a young man at the dinner table is zombified by the impenetrable 2027 version of what must be a GameBoy. Cuarons so deft with pacing that even such intentionally slow spots as chill time at Jaspers hideaway seem perfectly natural. The film also boasts some jaw-dropping camera work in astonishingly planned long set-pieces. In one Theo and company are driving along a country road when enemies on foot attack from a hillside and give chase. In another Theo makes his way through a bombed-out besieged building filled with squatters and fighters dropping all around him from stray lead. Cuaron and his four other screenwriters depart from P.D. James more contemplative 1992 novel -- he has freely admitted that he didnt even read it -- for the better. Whats both bold and frustrating are the ambiguities that hang like the huge Pink-Floydesque pig floating in the industrial background of one scene. Theres no explanation for the worlds infertility crisis. And although I was fully in fight-or-flight mode by the end I had to wonder what all that trauma really added up to.

"Children of Men | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; children-of-men ) Children of Men (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Children of Men Alfonso CuarA3ns adaptation of the P.D. James novel takes a look at England in an apocalyptic near-future when standards of law and order have broken down and the country is ruled by a fascist dictator. The movie is set in 2027 - a mere 21 years in the future - but theres a simple explanation for how the world got from where it is today to where it is in the film the human race has become sterile. Beginning around 2009 women became unable to have babies. Now the species is aging and dying. In less than 100 years there will be no trace of man left on the planet. Children of Men isnt interested in dissecting the reasons for the situation but in exploring the societal ramifications of it. The movie could be classified as science fiction but its real interest is in examining how different people react to the impending end of everything and how one ray of hope becomes a tool used for a power-grab. Although the premise character names and some of the plot points remain the same the movie Children of Men is radically different from the novel upon which it is based. The script underwent several revisions and each one took it further from the source material. This isnt necessarily a bad thing. P.D. James is among todays elite mystery writers; The Children of Men which falls outside of her usual genre may be her weakest book. It contains evocative passages and some interesting and powerful ideas but it often reads too much like an erudite potboiler. In developing the story for the screen CuarA3n has changed things around to make it more cinematic. Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is at the center of a maelstrom that is about to erupt between government forces and a loosely organized group of rebels. He is recruited by an ex-lover Julian (Julianne Moore) with whom he split 20 years ago after the death of their child. Theo is a broken-down loser but his perspective on life changes when he meets Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) a pregnant young woman. Julians goal is to hide Kee until she can be spirited out of England to a place of safety run by a mysterious group called ""The Human Project."" (Agurably the silliest and most contrived conceit in the movie.) Others have different ideas viewing Kees baby as a crucial tool for establishing power (the rebels) or maintaining it (the government). Julians idealism has no place in their worldview. Ultimately the responsibility to protect Kee falls to Theo and he has a persistent and dangerous adversary in Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofore) the rebel leader. His lone allies are a midwife Miriam (Pam Ferris) and an aging hippie (Michael Caine). Some will see Children of Men as an allegory but I view it more as a cautionary tale. Points are made about assisted suicide and the dangers of immigration control but these are tangential to the main story. The strength of CuarA3ns vision is the way he represents the rebels as being equally as rapacious and amoral as the government. They may be fighting a totalitarian regime but they are in no way depicted as being ""the good guys."" Their goal seems to be less freedom for the masses than power for themselves. Theres an ethical quagmire here that CuarA3n forces many of the characters to navigate. The tone of the movie is bleak - perhaps even bleaker than that of the book. (The novel contains a love story to lighten things that is absent from the movie.) 2027 England is a depressing crumbling place. Man in his last years is shown to be reverting to animal form as anarchy spreads. How much longer before the concept of government will have no meaning? How much longer before basic services such as electricity and running water will no longer be possible? Children of Men provides us with a glimpse of the possible beginning of the collapse. Its a unique view of the end of the world - one that comes not through war famine or disease but from the human races inability to reproduce. (Note CuarA3n like James does not assign blame for the sterility. Its scientifically inexplicable - an act of fate or God.) The camerawork by Emmanuel Lubezki is remarkable long unbroken shots and images that make London look as it did in the years after World War II. The film is the anti-MTV with edits used sparingly. Theres an amazing scene in a car that lasts nearly five minutes without a cut and its one of several with similar lengths. The color palette is desaturated with the result favoring grays over other hues. This is a bleak future and CuarA3n intends to emphasize that. Children of Men is uncompromising in the way it paints a world that none of us would want to live in. A deliberately low-key cast was chosen - actors picked more for their ability to inhabit characters than appear attractive on the marquee. Clive Owen who can be a chameleon portrays Theo as a flawed reluctant hero. Part of him is searching for solace from the two decades-old death of his toddler son and he finds it in becoming Kees protector. (This theme makes more sense in the book in which Theo was inadvertently responsible for the childs death. In the movie the cause was influenza.) Michael Caine and Julianne Moore dont have large roles but they add energy to the proceedings. (Theo is not the most lively of protagonists.) The underrated Chiwetel Ejiofore plays the conflicted rebel leader. Peter Mullan has a scene-stealing performance as an unbalanced military man. And Claire-Hope Ashitey in her first major role exhibits strength and determination - two qualities necessary from the possible mother of a new human race. Often with movies that are adapted from books its easy to assess whether the cinematic version is superior or inferior to the written one. In the case of Children of Men the divergence of material is so great that such a simple determination cannot be made. CuarA3ns interpretation inspired more than based on James novel takes on a life of its own. Stripped bare this is essentially a chase movie (with Theo spending more than half of the movie with Kee keeping her out of the hands of one group or another) but the setting context and thematic backbone make it compelling. Although I reject the allegory label in this case Children of Men has a few things to say about the human condition. Although imperfect its engaging thought-provoking stuff.

Updated July 30 2016  454 am Full Forecast Opinion Obits Sports Wine Buy amp; Sell Homes Bleak Children of Men offers ray of hope amid humanitys undoing By DAVID GERMAINAP Movie Writer Dec 28 2006 0 On the surface Christmas Day seems a foolish time to release a somber tale of humanity about to reach its expiration date from a plague of infertility that leaves the planet childless and hopeless. Yet harsh as Alfonso Cuarons ""Children of Men"" is the tiny glimmer of salvation the film presents surprisingly makes it the perfect release date if you can get beyond the bleak near-future the filmmaker constructs. Its definitely worth setting aside your urge for lightweight escapism and diving into this heavy provocative tale set so closely to our times and so recognizably an extension of our world that it offers an intriguing chance for reflection on how we treat one another and what we take for granted. ""Children of Men"" is a movie of ideas disguised as a thriller whose action can be fitful at times. Yet Cuaron maintains a steady momentum and the story is carried by a sturdy if chilly performance from Clive Owen and spirited support from Michael Caine Julianne Moore and newcomer Clare-Hope Ashitey. Adapted from P.D. James novel ""Children of Men"" opens on communal mourning in the year 2027 as whats left of civilization weeps over the slaying of an 18-year-old who was the worlds youngest person. After a flu pandemic in 2008 complete infertility struck women worldwide a year later. Rather than rallying together to find a solution society fell apart the worst of human nature asserting itself as racism runs wild borders close immigrants seeking better lives are penned in like livestock and the gap between privileged and poor grows to a colossal chasm. Great Britain alone has maintained a semblance of cruel order soldiering on despite the pervading doom. Through this miserable landscape plods Theo (Owen) whose pre-plague idealism has given way to casual fatalism leaving him a man whos just trying to get through the day unnoticed and run out the clock in peace and quiet. Theos activist past catches up with him when old flame Julian (Moore) leader of a terrorist group battling inequities of the isolationist government enlists him to help smuggle young Fuji immigrant Kee (Ashitey) out of the country. Turns out Kee may prove to be humanitys last hope for survival but Julian and her gang dont trust the government to do right by her. The film follows the journey from apathy to reluctant action and ultimately heroism for Theo who becomes Kees protector against a heartless government and factions that want to exploit her. Caine provides a nice contrast for Owens dour Theo. As an old pal living in a secret countryside haven Caines Jasper remains wily fun-loving and even a bit idealistic despite the chaos all around. The cast is rounded out by small but lively turns from Chiwetel Ejiofor Charlie Hunnam and Danny Huston with Peter Mullan especially effective as an opportunistic cop with an idiosyncratic way of referring to himself in the third person. Director Cuaron one of five credited screenwriters on ""Children of Men"" injects a sense of urgency into the film with long continuous segments using handheld cameras. Much of the action unfolds with the energy of TV footage following breaking news in a war zone. Design of clothes sets cars and other trappings are subtle tweaks of the here and now appropriate for a world just two decades ahead where the finer points of fashion comfort and consumer progress have taken a backseat to the coming end of the species. Even more reflective of today are the films social and political trappings. Images of immigrants rounded-up in cages are frightening extremes of the xenophobic reaction the global migration of the last decade has provoked among some people. Its stark stuff for the man who made ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and the road-trip romp ""Y Tu Mama Tambien."" Yet Cuarons simple powerful closing image is a beacon of hope at just the right moment in this desolate but thoughtful study of humankinds resilience. ""Children of Men"" a Universal release is rated R for strong violence language some drug use and brief nudity. Running time 109 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. x Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment x Report Cancel Report Abuse x Watch this discussion.

Very very good. Children of Men Alfonso Cuarons vision of an infertile war-torn future is a grim masterpiece In 2027 London Theo (Clive Owen) helps the pregnant Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) to safety. (jaap buitendijk/double negative/universal pictures) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 25 2006 The end of the world is upon us in the grim and grimy future-London of Alfonso Cuarons ""Children of Men."" Illegal immigrants are locked in big cages that sit on sidewalks. The streets are war zones (it looks as if the Blitz came back). And even more urgent women not too long ago lost the capacity to reproduce naturally. A child hasnt been born in 19 years and in the films harrowing opening minutes its reported that Earths last-born son has died in a terrorist bombing. The world might go on but it appears that we will not.This is an extraordinary artistic breakthrough from a Mexican director who was already fearlessly good to begin with. His contribution to the ""Harry Potter"" franchise dared to mix an element of real-world wickedness into J.K. Rowlings fantasy. ""Children of Men"" uses science-fiction to show us what we stand to become if not how we actually are.Cuaron suggests that a planet mired in apocalypse is even more doomed without hope of children. Its dumber too Violence and hostility rage on as if mankind is in a rush to finish itself off. Taken from a 14-year-old P.D. James book and brilliantly refashioned by the director and four other screenwriters (when have so many scribes ever produced a movie this good?) ""Children of Men"" pushes yesterdays and todays moral quagmires and human atrocities into the not-too-distant future. (The film is set in 2027 and thats closer than you think.)In Cuarons visionary refraction of now this London is Camp X-Ray Abu Ghraib  Baghdad Beirut Detroit the seething id of a paranoid polluted Western dystopia. In Cuarons allegory this is the sort of fascist nightmare that world leaders say theyre trying to protect us from.People still go to work ride the bus and throw away money at the dog tracks. Amid this bleak normalcy there may be a glimmer of hope. One afternoon a gang of masked thugs plucks Theo (Clive Owen) off the streets and takes him to their leader an imposing woman with pellucid skin and an opaque agenda. Her name is Julian she is played by Julianne Moore and she used to be Theos girlfriend and partner in leftist crime. They were part of an activist human-rights organization called the Fishes and they havent seen each other in the two decades since their baby died in a flu pandemic. Now she needs his help. It seems a young black refugee named Kee ( Clare-Hope Ashitey) needs travel permits that Theo can help get her.Owen plays his character as a gathering headwind of disbelief and determination. The films fraught atmosphere intensifies as Theo finds himself drawn into a grand Fish cabal that includes the ever sturdy Chiwetel Ejiofor. And in one divine sequence we discover why. Kee summons Theo into a barn and reveals her pregnant belly. Emmanuel Lubezkis camera dotes on the image and well it should. Cuaron has given us a live Renaissance painting by way of the Saatchi Gallery Black Madonna with Child. Suddenly the audience and Theo know whats at stake. A boat called the Tomorrow is arriving to take her to a group thats planning a new society and it falls to Theo to get her there. Before the breathtaking hell of that journey theres a restorative layover at the woodland cottage of Theos jaundice-haired stoner friend Jasper whos played by Michael Caine in a splendid Richard Harris impersonation. Jasper is a New Age crackpot but Cuaron is on his side letting us see him care for his wife who was left catatonic after being tortured by the police. ""Shanti shanti"" he exclaims at one point invoking the Hindu word for peace.Naturally thats nowhere to be found. Theos cousin (Danny Huston) has managed to get his hands on an assortment of art treasures. In a downright Kubrickian joke Michelangelos David stands in his foyer with a prosthetic leg and outside his window floats Pink Floyds flying pig but the piece-de-resistance is Picassos enormous war-epic ""Guernica"" which hovers in the background of a few shots. In the pictures last act Cuaron builds his own version of Picassos masterpiece in a bravura sequence set at a refugee camp thats as big and lethally harsh as some Third World countries. The place erupts into combat once the Fishes break in and ignite a revolt.Throughout ""Children of Men"" Cuaron offers affectionate moments the house pets that cling to Theo Ashiteys inextinguishable jocularity and the superb Peter Mullan as a friendly guard at that camp. But in that battle sequence the violence grinds mercilessly on so hard in fact that during an extended sequence dots of blood remain splattered on the camera lens. Its not simply Cuarons ideas that make this movie great -- other filmmakers have been similarly dismayed by these times. Its the audaciousness of his execution.""Children of Men"" has a blistering immediacy thats singular in this age of rapid cutting. Along with Alex Rodriguez Cuaron cut the picture himself and while he uses digital effects as enrichment he builds scenes within the cameras frame rather than just in an editing room. So the film is as theatrical as it is cinematic.Filmed almost entirely with handheld cameras and desaturated of bright color the movie looks and feels like something that was made decades ago a gloomy rock opera or ""A Clockwork Orange."" For the occasion Cuaron has even acquired Kubricks appetite for dark materials -- up to a point. The film feels like a tribute to the late directors ruthlessness and delight in visual surprise. But Cuaron isnt the nihilist Kubrick was. Despite all the destruction in ""Children of Men"" he manages to say something Kubrick never had the heart to Shanti shantiWesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Bound and hooded by a group of activists-turned-terrorists-trying-to-turn-activists-again a kidnapped Clive Owen sits in a shelter papered in a decades worth of tabloid headlines. They scream of war nuclear mishaps and ecological disaster. Its real end-of-the-world stuff presented in the form of everyday material much like the film around it. Children Of Men directed and co-written by Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) is set in 2027 but each strand of its dystopian vision comes tethered to 2006. Its all chillingly disgustingly plausible and the familiarity only amplifies its power to shock. Theres much more to Cuarons film adapted from a P.D. James novel than a tour of a world gone terribly wrong but the story comes tightly bound to its intricately realized setting a fascist Britain thats also apparently the last nightmarish refuge of civilization. The parts of humanity that havent already been destroyed wither away due to the mysterious onset of widespread infertility which has prevented anyone from giving birth for 18 years. The British government rounds up all non-native residents for the good of the state shipping them off to refugee camps and beyond doubt even worse fates. Animal corpses litter the countryside and people with agendas are always blowing up something or other. As a former radical now whiling away his time drinking scotch and manning a desk in a low-level bureaucratic office Owen seems content to watch the world go to hell until his ex-wife (Julianne Moore) a leader of the pro-immigrant Fishes presses him into retrieving a pair of illegal travel passes in the hopes of reaching a group of much-rumored never-confirmed benevolent off-shore scientists called The Human Project. Their motives tied to the well-being of a young immigrant (Claire-Hope Ashitey) will soon become clear but only after the cost of failure has been made equally clear. Cuaron directs Children Of Men with remarkable long takes and indelible images but it isnt the kind of craft that immediately calls attention to itself; Cuaron moves the story along with an intensity that makes it hard to pay attention to anything else. Its a film of astonishing immediacy with all the urgency of a late-night phone call but the human element drives it. Owen begins a broken man with little to sustain him beyond his relationship with a paternal Michael Caine whose activism has devolved into a vague hopefulness and a routine of smoking pot listening to music and caring for his semi-comatose wife. By the films end Owen has been transformed and the possibility raised that the world might change with him. Cuaron has created a dire warning of the world that could be but hes also made a film about faith love sacrifice and all the other hard-won virtues that keep the world alive. Its a heartbreaking bullet-strewn valentine to what keeps us human.

Running time 114 minutes. Rated R (strong violence profanity brief nudity drug use). Opens Monday at the Empire the Lincoln Square the Village East. THE report from 2027 delivered by ""Children of Men"" is mixed. On the plus side Flat-screen TVs for every one Also alcohol is plentiful and the dog track is still operating. On the minus side The world has turned to smoldering ruins and its been 18 years since any woman has given birth. Also the leading consumer product - the Coca-Cola of Dystopia - is a suicide drug called ""Quietus."" Motto ""You decide when."" Playing Theo the shell of an alcoholic whose son has died Clive Owen is just the man to pick his way through the wreckage of what used to be London He reportedly turned down the chance to be James Bond because to him it aint acting if light banter is involved. He is an outstanding performer but only suffering is on Clives menu. Not that he plays Jesus in this movie. Nope. Hes merely Joseph. After a surprise visit from his ex (Julianne Moore) who now leads a group fighting to protect immigrants from being caged and deported he stumbles onto a woman (she jokes that shes a virgin) who is pregnant with the only baby on the planet. They spend the movie dashing from safe house to safe house one of which is the home of a chuckling old stoner played by Michael Caine who appears to be wearing Emmylou Harris hair. The goal is to save the child. And humanity. Everyone around them is a terrorist and most are wearing government insignia. Between the marching Muslim extremists snarling immigrant-haters gun-toting immigrant-protectors and a police force determined to crack skulls first and ask questions never London has turned into a bombed-out ashtray. Director Alfonso Cuaron has a vision so mesmerizingly terrible that it alone - at least for those who enjoy a gorgeous nightmare - is reason enough to see the film. His color palette runs from soot gray to corpse gray as he hurls his camera over the festering landscape. Nothing is presented with the slightest degree of ""Road Warrior"" fun either This is humanitys garbage time in both senses. The story based on P.D. James novel grabs you at first but its grip slackens as the unanswered questions and murky plot developments add up. In addition to saving the girl you want Theo to solve several mysteries Is this really the only pregnancy? If so what is different about this woman? Why did all women become sterile back in 2009? Who exactly can he trust? Instead Theo seems content to dodge bullets get increasingly grimy and try to get mother and fetus to a mysterious organization called ""The Human Project."" As moving as it is to see one father figure one innocent mother and one swaddled infant trying to emerge from hell one baby isnt going to save humanity so their journey by itself seems pointless. The film wants to be political; if it aspired merely to entertain it would have a bit more of the wit Theo shows when he casually pauses in mid-Armageddon to say ""What a day."" But it completely misses the point about what is happening today to the same farcical degree that ""V for Vendetta"" did Who seriously has an equal fear of Londons bobbies and radical Islam? In the past five years the movie industry has virtually blacklisted any mention of Muslim terror - even documentarians are more worried about Wal-Marts health insurance - but ""Children of Men"" makes sure its buses which are filled with political prisoners are labeled ""Homeland Security.""

Though this adaptation of P.D. James novel about impending human extinction leaves some plot points dangling and details unexplained the mood created by director Alfonso Cuaron is bleakly compelling. VIDEO  See the trailer from Children of Men The setting is England and the time is only 20 years from now. But despair pervades as the human race has somehow become infertile. Civilization has grown chaotic and decayed. There are ruined buildings and fires raging on every corner despite the omnipresence of armed guards. Waves of immigrants have descended on Britain. Once there they are rounded up and caged in camps conjuring up images of Nazi Germany. There is an underground effort to improve things but even that is fraught with power struggles and internal corruption. The wealthy cultural elites have retreated into seclusion. Picassos seminal Guernica hanging in the background of one key scene creates a potent symbol of a world where art no longer matters and the most educated people sequester themselves rather than seek answers or challenge the status quo. Clive Owen plays a former political activist who becomes a reluctant hero when he agrees to ferry a miraculously pregnant immigrant (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to a safe haven. Once there her newborn can be studied by scientists looking to save the future of mankind. Leading the resistance movement is Owens ex-wife (Julianne Moore). The film features two of the most visually charged edge-of-the-seat chase sequences of recent memory. Owen and Ashiteys escape from the compound of the resistance movement is tensely drawn out and a shockingly sudden attack during a roadway chase makes a lasting impression. Handheld photography heightens the tension. Narrative pitfalls are obscured by Cuarons technical wizardry. From 1995s A Little Princess to 2001s Y Tu Mama Tambien to 2004s Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and now this fierce dystopian adventure the Mexican filmmaker continues to grow creatively and expand his technical virtuosity. The film falters somewhat when it comes to emotionally engaging characters despite the presence of a talented ensemble cast that includes Chiwetel Ejiofor Michael Caine and Danny Huston. Moores brief turn as a freedom fighter is disappointing. Usually a multifaceted actress she is a cipher here. Owen is excellent with a world-weariness tempered by occasional flashes of dark humor. Children of Men has a provocative message offering a cautious but palpable sense of hope in the midst of misery.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 22 2006 1253AM EST Last updated Tuesday Apr. 07 2009 346AM EDT Comments AA Children of Men Directed by Alfonso Cuaron Written by Alfonso Cuaron Timothy Sexton David Arata Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby Starring Clive Owen Michael Caine and Julianne Moore Classification 14A Rating  ""Very odd what happens to the world without the sound of childrens voices."" Instantly up to speed and powered by that rarest of cinematic fuels - intelligent action - Children of Men is a nativity story for the ages this or any other. A dazzling pre-credit sequence sets both the fast pace and the dark tone. London November 2027 where the skies are grey and the denizens are nervous and terrorist bombs are exploding in Fleet Street shops. Yes its a near future that bears an uncanny resemblance to the present save for the hot story that has the media buzzing ""The youngest person on the planet has just died."" The deceased was 18. For nearly two decades our species has failed to reproduce itself; humankind has become infertile. But this premise like all the exposition that follows is never allowed to slap us in the face. Rather it sneaks up with eerie stealth growing organically from casual asides embedded in the dialogue or from subtle images planted at the edges of the frame. That adroitness shouldnt be surprising. Whether its a road movie ( Y Tu Mama Tambien) or a literary adaptation ( Great Expectations) or a franchise picture ( Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) director Alfonso Cuaron has made a habit of giving conventional genres his own unconventional twist. However working from a P.D. James novel hes never before twisted so much and to such unique effect. For example this is a dystopian tale with the protective distance removed with tomorrow simultaneously hinged to today and rooted in yesterday. This is an action film that spurns the usual blizzard of fast edits for single long gorgeously fluid takes. And this is sci-fi that looks and sounds like a documentary report filed from a London that could be Baghdad. Or Warsaw. Or Nazareth. Our guide is apathetic Theo and Clive Owen plays him with Bogartian world-weariness - an erstwhile rebel whos abandoned his faith in any cause a resigned croupier with no love left for lifes crapshoot. An early scene sees him as motley as his surroundings quitting the rubble of the city for a trip to the country where he heads way off-road to share some civilized talk and lots of home-grown weed with Jasper the aged hippie (Michael Caine delightfully bewigged and just plain delightful). Listen closely here and note how the expository info flows so naturally from their conversation - hinting at the causes of the infertility crisis; flicking at the way a militaristic government has traded off liberty for homeland security; pointing out how illegal immigrants fleeing their even more devastated countries are ""hunted down like cockroaches"" and herded into ghettoes for deportation. Cue the smart action. Back in hectic London an armed group calling themselves the Fishes (the Christian symbols here are present and accounted for but not overdone) is battling the state to protest its mistreatment of the immigrants. Led by Julian (Julianne Moore) the Fishes are legitimate freedom-fighters and they are unabashed terrorists quite capable of kidnapping Theo at gunpoint then bribing him to wangle a rare ""transit pass"" from his rich cousin. The ensuing scene which unfolds within the barricaded luxury of the citys equivalent to the Green Zone is the films only blatant venture into sci-fi territory and you may find it off-putting. I thought it bizarre yet fascinating especially the sight of a looted Picasso Guernica no less mounted proudly on the mansions wall - one war redeemed by art only to become the booty of one more war. The stolen papers permit the arrival of a young African woman named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) whose appearance sets the stage for Cuarons most memorable display of virtuoso camera-work five passengers crammed into a small car that comes under attack the mood shifting like quicksilver from playful joviality to fearsome violence with the entire sequence unravelling in a single extraordinarily busy but butter-smooth shot. In the melee theres a death and it comes as a shocking surprise. The rest is essentially an extended chase movie but again one that is often stopping to think and always offering up peripheral little nuggets of intrigue - like the billboard ad with the proud pharmaceutical boast ""Quietus You Decide When""; or the religious fanatics milling at a street-corner and chanting ""Infertility is Gods punishment."" Drugs that offer the solace of euthanasia zealots who morally stigmatize a sexual pandemic - have I already argued that the future has an awfully contemporary ring? Its not a spoiler to reveal the inevitable Kee who after all harkens from the cradle of homo sapiens is toting a precious bundle. Of course shes pregnant carrying the hope of the worlds first birth in two decades. ""Its a miracle"" someone says but neither Kee nor the film is having any of that. Shes just a village girl with a healthy libido and a host of willing partners a combination that gives our latter-day Mary the perfect chance to toss off a line as funny as it is profane ""Fuck knows who the father is"" Inevitably too (the best yarns have a knack for mixing inevitability with surprise) Theo drops the anti- from his hero to assume the role of Kees saviour. Together they elude the many pursuers who would use her for their various political designs racing towards a sanctuary that may be real or could be mythic but does have a wonderfully hopeful name - its called simply the Human Project. Their flight takes them to the walled ghetto where the nativity scene occurs in a concrete manger among the poor and huddled masses. The infant is born into violence into a Warsaw uprising that brings fierce fighting and then a true miracle The baby cries and hearing the wondrous sound of a childs voice the combatants on both sides stop to marvel. For a few suspended seconds all is calm all is peace until the moment for marvelling ends and the eternity for fighting starts up anew. Children of Men reaches its own ambiguous end on the polluted waters of the Thames where a boat christened Tomorrow rocks steadily in a fog that refuses to lift. Its a lovely and fitting tableau that so typical of Cuarons delicate mastery leaves the preaching to others and the decision to us - sink or swim.

"Children of Men | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Children of Men Print Page Email Page Search Children of Men (2006; Rated ) B "" I probably didnt give this film enough credit when it was released."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Children of Men(2006; R)In theaters Monday 25 December 2006 Summary In 2027 in a chaotic world in which humans can no longer procreate a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea where her childs birth may help scientists save the future of humankind. Genre Adventure Mystery Science Fiction ThrillerDirector Alfonso CuaronCast Clive Owen ""The world has collapsed; only Britain soldiers on."" -- British TV announcer in Children of Men. Just about every movie set in the future paints the bleakest picture imaginable. Cities are in ruins chaos rules the streets oppressive governments watch your every move -- and its usually raining. Not to mention the fashion. Why are muted greys and trench coats always the wave of the future? Does the Bible foretell of a worldwide ban on pastels in the 21st century? These movies could be viewed as cautionary tales warning us that if we dont get our act together the world will crumble under the weight of terrorism and disease and corruption and hate. They could also be taken as evidence of our overwhelming lack of faith in our children and our childrens children. Guess we dont believe theyll have the hearts and minds to right our wrongs and create a better world. Children of Men is a dark and violent near-future sci-fi thriller set in Britain in 2027 which isnt all that far off. (I mean Dakota Fanning will only be in her early 30s.) But if you think things are rough now wait until you get a load of this era. Every civilization except Britain is in total ruins -- and Britain itself is teetering on the brink of anarchy. All refugees are rounded up caged and deported to distant outposts. London is dirty and dangerous and is plagued by random bombings. Government troops are at war with a rebel group known as the Fishes. And for reasons never explained no child has been born anywhere on the planet since 2009. There is no next generation. The world is dying. The always-excellent Clive Owen (the ruddy-faced tough guy who might have been the only better James Bond than Daniel Craig) plays Theo Faron a former activist who is yanked back into the game by his former lover Julian (Julianne Moore) who pulled away from him years ago after the death of their child. Knowing Theo is nearly broke and living from whisky bottle to whisky bottle Julian and her cohorts kidnap Theo and ""ask"" him to help them transport a young refugee named Kee out of the country and to the near-mythical (and never-seen) Human Project a sanctuary where scientists and doctors are working furiously to solve the infertility question. Why is this girl so important to the Fishes and their fight for freedom and equality? Why are they willing to risk their lives before they would let the government get its controlling hands on her? Heres a hint Shes taken to wearing baggy blouses and shes not always feeling so great. Clive Owen is an actor who looks most comfortable onscreen when hes wiping blood off his lip and ignoring the fact that hes been wearing the same clothes for three straight days. Hes perfectly cast as the me-first reluctant anti-hero who will talk a tough game but will do the right thing when push comes to gunshots. Julianne Moore is an actors actor but she seems disconnected from her role as a tough-talking freedom-fighting rebel leader. Her character might not be as pivotal to the story as the ads and trailers indicate and thats not necessarily a bad thing. Directed with gritty style by Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) Children of Men is crammed with big ideas but isnt particularly interested in exploring those ideas. Why exactly did every country except Britain collapse? What did they do here that wasnt done elsewhere? Why is every woman in the entire world infertile? What happened? Maybe any attempt to explain these things would mire the story in expositional quicksand and give the film a veneer of pretentious silliness. Were just expected to accept this world and to root for Theo and Kee. This is probably the feel-not-so-great movie of the new year. But if youre in the proper semi-dark mood its a gritty gem.

"Gravity movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Gravity a breathtaking space adventure  1/2 Video Gravity will be talked about for weeks Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and Tasha Robinson of The Dissolve discuss the ""experience"" of seeing ""Gravity."" (Posted on October 3 2013) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and Tasha Robinson of The Dissolve discuss the ""experience"" of seeing ""Gravity."" (Posted on October 3 2013) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""Gravity"" defies itself. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney play astronauts -- a newbie scientist and a veteran cowboy -- who dodge space debris and the usual narrative expectations while coping with a highly compressed series of crises 372 miles above the Earths surface. Its a nerve-wracking visual experience of unusual and paradoxical delicacy. And if your stomach can take it its truly something to see.Director and co-writer Alfonso Cuaron who wrote the script with his son Jonas has delivered unto big screens (the best way to go with this one for sure) an hour and a half of breathtaking oxygen-depleted cinema as accomplished and crafty in its illusions as Georges Melies ""A Trip to the Moon"" was 111 years ago. Im not sure its a game-changer whatever that means in the roiling film industry of the moment. The movie hasnt much on its mind; some of the writing is pretty clunky; and theres a rather cheap aspect to the female protagonists tragic secret. But ""Gravity"" is the first movie in a long time Ive been eager to see again and quickly just to re-experience the size and flow of its images and appreciate the howd-they-do-that? of it all.The movie begins with a killer 13-minute single take building on Cuarons most elegant sustained camera movement in his previous feature the undervalued ""Children of Men"" (2006). Bullock and Clooney are medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone and astronaut Matt Kowalski respectively and essentially theyre starring in a two-character off-Broadway play in space with an 80 million scenic budget. The film interweaves an array of digital effects with intricately choreographed live action paying close attention to both human interplay and human/camera relationships.Stone and Kowalski along with their colleagues are wrapping up a space shuttle mission involving an add-on to the Hubble telescope. A few minutes into the picture disaster strikes in the form of flying satellite debris scattered by an explosion.The rest of ""Gravity"" finds Stones and Kowalskis oxygen levels heading toward the red zone while their communications with NASA mission control are lost. (Ed Harris who apparently never left NASA after ""Apollo 13"" is heard as the voice of mission control.) Stones attempts to reach the nearby international space station then a Chinese space station as she scrambles as fast as slow-motion gravitational circumstances allow occupy much of the rest of the story.Bullocks character is burdened by a grievous loss intended as the emotional underpinning of ""Gravity."" The movie conspires to put Stone through various degrees of physical and psychological hell. Its the slickest-ever serial installment of ""The Perils of Pauline"" with a more capable female protagonist. You never can tell with these things but Im very curious to find out how a global audience will respond to Cuarons stripped-down exposition-lite storyline. Whats remarkable about the film has nothing to do with anything anyone actually says out loud. The characters represent coping mechanism strategies Clooneys nattering veteran contrasting sharply (and somewhat self-consciously) with Bullocks determined if queasy first-timer.Whats remarkable about ""Gravity"" is all the silence coupled with the clarity and detail of the images of space walks and space panic and the view from up there. One second were seeing the Earth through Stones astonished eyes from inside her helmet; the next the camera appears to have drifted outside that helmet and were regarding her from a new angle. Then something comes drifting (or whizzing) into view from miles away.Much of ""Gravity"" has been photographed or assembled to appear to be happening in real time in a single take. Cuaron loves a flowing sequence but as co-editor of the picture hes also a wizard at knowing precisely when to cut for emphasis. The film reminds us of two things. One the pleasure of being in the company of a first-rate director who knows how to move a camera around. Two the pleasure of seeing a popcorn picture showcasing a genuine leap forward in cinematic and digital technology. The 3-D was added in postproduction but its a valuable add-on indeed.Clooney could scarcely be more relaxed and ingratiating in a role originally earmarked for Robert Downey Jr.; the characters banter may not be daisy-fresh but Clooney finesses it like a pro. Bullock remains front center and in a coolly controlled sweat throughout ""Gravity.""She and Clooney shot much of their footage in a 9-by-9-foot cube in costume calibrating their movements and dialogue rhythms to effects-based footage Cuaron shot with the films inspired cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki a longtime Cuaron collaborator. Actors usually are required to hit their marks but the rigorous spatial and timing specifics of the ""Gravity"" shoot daunted Downey who bailed and made way for Clooney.To say this sort of assignment requires a highly technical acting approach is to understate things. Yet one of the reasons audiences like both Clooney and Bullock has nothing to do with their technical facility and everything to do with their grace under fictional pressure.Way back in ""Speed"" there was Bullock getting truthful laughs out of the dumbest thriller premise ever. ""Gravity"" may not have much more on its mind than ""Speed"" but its a relief to see an unconventional big-budget studio movie that doesnt hew to the same old pounding action beats or person-to-person physical violence.""Gravity"" proceeds to an action beat all its own. Its relentless and theres a miniclimax tacked onto the maxiclimax thats like enough already. Yet even that belongs to a long proud moviemaking tradition of beautifully executed excess.mjphillipstribune.com""Gravity"" -- 3 1/2 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense perilous sequences some disturbing images and brief strong language)Running time 131 Opens 10 p.m. Thursday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Action (Movie Genre) Science Entertainment Movies Gravity (movie) George Clooney Alfonso Cuaron Alfonso Cuaron discusses Gravity ahead of the films Friday release Latest movie reviews Gravity -- 3 1/2 stars Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1001-gravity-20131004-column.html#page=1,200,childrenofmen29,childrenofmen,chicagotribune

Comments (1) Children of Men Recommended Adapted from P.D. Jamess dystopian novel this SF feature by Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) takes place in England in 2027 when the human race has mysteriously become infertile and faces extinction. A onetime revolutionary (Clive Owen) is asked by an old flame (Julianne Moore) to take part in her underground movement defending illegal aliens who are trucked off to concentration camps; assisted by an older hippie pal (Michael Caine in an Oscar-worthy performance) he agrees to smuggle a young woman (Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of the country. The film gradually devolves into action-adventure then the equivalent of a war movie. But the filmmaking is pungent throughout and the first half hour is so jaw-dropping in its fleshed-out extrapolation that Cuaron earns the right to coast a bit. R 108 min.

"Too close at hand - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEWS Too close at handThe intense `Children of Men is set in a near future to give us pause today.December 22 2006|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer THE best science fiction talks about the future to talk about the now and ""Children of Men"" very much belongs in that class. Made with palpable energy intensity and excitement it compellingly creates a world gone mad that is uncomfortably close to the one we live in. It is a ""Blade Runner"" for the 21st century a worthy successor to that epic of dystopian decay.Like that earlier film ""Children of Men"" is based on a novel (P.D. James this time not Philip K. Dick) and deals with the question of the future of human life. It brings so much urgency to the possibility of the world ending that we feel the kind of terror we would if the scenario were taking place tomorrow instead of 20 years in the future.Also in Alfonso Cuaron ""Children of Men"" has a strong director with a powerhouse visual sense who is at home with both action sequences and philosophical concerns. Cuaron with such widely diverse films as ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" behind him demonstrates once again that no genre is beyond his mastery.The plot hook of ""Children of Men"" is simple but devastating the infertility of the entire human race. The date is 2027 and its been 18 years since the Earths last human child was born. James whose novel has been altered considerably by the films five credited screenwriters says she wrote it to answer the question ""If there were no future how would we behave?"" The answer in a word is horribly.For what ""Children of Men"" shows us is a world coming apart at the seams. Britain where the story is set has survived by becoming a chaotic police state in which rioters fueled by pure fury attack whatever moves and heavily armed police and savage dogs keep a close eye on ever-present refugees stuffed into sidewalk holding tanks. ""Renouncers"" flog themselves for the forgiveness of humanity public service ads insist ""The world has collapsed only Britain soldiers on"" and an underground group called the Fishes fights for equal rights for that flood of immigrants.This again like ""Blade Runner"" is an undeniably pulpy premise but two things elevate ""Children of Men"" One is the sheer forcefulness of the storytelling the other the films brilliant visual look and style.The story line here is again quite simple. A disheartened bureaucrat named Theo (Clive Owen master of the disillusioned look) has cut himself off from most human contact except for an old friend and hippie drug dealer named Jasper (Michael Caine in a way weve not seen him before).This all changes when Theo comes face to face with Julian (Julianne Moore) his old flame who turns out to be part of the leadership of the Fishes. She and her lieutenant Chiwetel Ejiofors Luke want his help in procuring exit visas for a young refugee woman named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey). It will surprise no one who has noticed ""Children of Men"" is opening on Christmas Day that astonishingly Kee is with child.Theo reluctantly agrees to help and all kinds of unexpected complications follow in the wake of that decision. Everyone has agendas within agendas and even simple notions like the importance of getting Kee to safety turn out to mean different things to different people. And because of Kees urgent condition every decision is taken under the ever-higher pressure of increasingly dire time constraints.The critical factor in helping keep that tension at a high pitch critical in getting us to take seriously what could be a lurid premise is Cuarons skill in not only motivating his actors but also in creating such a ferocious sense of forward momentum that everything feels more real -- and more terrifying -- than would seem possible.Essential here is exceptional work by production designers Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland who create a world of garbage and decay that looks both contemporary and futuristic. Most remarkable of all is what Cuarons longtime director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki has accomplished by shooting entirely hand-held with few lights greatly increasing the films verisimilitude. Although everyone will notice the bravura work of camera operator George Richmond during one continuous seven-minute-plus battle scene the skill of the cinematography team carries the film from the beginning to the end.Perhaps most delicate of all is the way director Cuaron has made ""Children of Men"" comment on the problems society faces today crises involving racism terrorism decaying infrastructure threatened environment government-inspired paranoia and more.This is a world of rubble fear and hopelessness whose connections to our own are never forced; Cuaron is such a fluid director with such a powerful imagination they dont have to be. This could well be our future and we know it.kenneth.turanlatimes.com""Children of Men."" MPAA rating R for strong violence language some drug use and brief nudity. Running time 1 hour 48 minutes.

"Alfonso Cuarons fantastic Children of Men. Slate Sign In Sign Up Alfonso Cuarons fantastic Children of Men. Alfonso Cuarons fantastic Children of Men. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 21 2006 620 PM The Movie of the Millennium Alfonso Cuarons fantastic Children of Men. By Dana Stevens Clive Owen and Julianne Moore in Children of Men Though Ill be coming out with a 10-best list in this space next week Ive never been much of one for the year-end obsession with sorting and ranking cultural products in neat rows. But Ill go out on a limb and say this Children of Men (Universal) Alfonso Cuarons dense dark and layered meditation on fertility technology immigration war love and life itself may be the movie of the still-young millennium. And I dont just mean its one of the best movies of the past six years. Children of Men based on the 1992 novel by P.D. James is the movie of the millennium because its about our millennium with its fractured fearful politics and random bursts of violence and terror. Though its set in the London of 2027 Cuarons film isnt some high-tech futuristic fantasy. It takes place in a grimly familiar location the hell we are currently making for ourselves. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The particular conditions of that hell sketched with a deft indirectness in the bravura opening sequence are these Since a fertility crisis of unknown origin struck in 2009 no new people have been born on earth. The human race is dying out slowly as the planet falls into political chaos. As a propagandistic slogan on a TV screen early in the film boasts ""The world has collapsed. Only Britain soldiers on""--mainly by means of a strict anti-immigration policy that rounds up refugees in cages to be sent to camps. When the worlds youngest living citizen an 18-year-old still known as ""Baby Diego"" dies in a bar brawl the whole planet mourns egged on by sentimental tabloid media that are only the barest exaggeration of our own. Advertisement Theo (Clive Owen) a former activist whos now a burned-out bureaucrat in the Ministry of Energy hardly reacts to the death of Baby Diego.""He was a wanker"" he tells his friend Jasper (Michael Caine) an ex-political cartoonist who makes a living selling pot in the countryside near London. ""Yeah but he was the worlds youngest wanker"" Jasper counters. On his way back to the city Theo is kidnapped by the Fishes a rebel group responsible for several recent bombings. As it happens the Fishes leader Julian (Julianne Moore) is Theos ex-wife with whom he had and lost a child 20 years before. Now all business Julian bribes Theo into using his connections to secure transit papers for a member of their group a young African immigrant named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey). As it turns out Kee is mysteriously pregnant only a month away from delivery. Soon the half-unwilling Theo is helping to smuggle Kee to the coast aided by a new-agey midwife (Pam Ferris) and hunted both by terrorist factions and government troops. When I said above that Children of Men is a ""layered"" film it wasnt a metaphor. Nearly every frame is a palimpsest of visual information from TV screens to graffiti-covered walls to the newspaper headlines and propaganda posters plastered everywhere in the gray and squalid London of Cuarons imagination. His vision of the future comes to us in details that are as precise as they are terrifying. ""Its Day 1000 of the Siege of Seattle"" burbles a radio voice as the movie opens and we dont need to hear any more than that to picture the United States as a distant war-torn police state like ... well a few others I could name.  The sound and production design lay the groundwork for a convincing dystopia but its Cuarons daring fluid camera that brings this terrible world to life. Without being showy about it he creates two of the most virtuoso single-shot chase sequences Ive ever seen. So virtuoso in fact that as the scenes are unfolding all you can think is sweet Jesus please let the good guys get away Its only later that you realize the technique that went into crafting that sickening suspense. In the first of the two sequences a car chase the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki helped create a special rig that allowed the camera to swivel 360 degrees around the interior of the car. The second sequence a siege on a building in a war zone provides the movies shattering climax; by the end of the nearly 10-minute shot the camera lens is spattered with dirt and (fake I hope) blood. Advertisement As reluctant hero Theo Owen has the weary gravity of a Mitchum or a Bogart. He seems like an adult a rare thing in action heroes these days and Moore is a perfect match as the rebel leader who gave up long ago on the luxury of personal happiness. Michael Caine plays Jasper as John Lennon if he really had lived to be 64 a loopy irreverent sage with a taste for strawberry-flavored pot. The scenes in Jaspers cozy hideout in the woods provide the only warmth in Theos uncompromisingly chilly world until he opens himself to the fragile hope growing inside the body of the decidedly unfragile Kee (played by 19-year-old Ashitey with great freshness and verve). I have almost nothing negative to say about Children of Men. A couple of scenes including one expository monologue by the midwife hit their emotional marks a little too neatly and one might argue that the particulars of the films political world are too vaguely sketched (though to me this obliqueness was one of the films strengths--it never condescends to its viewers with a pat history lesson). Cuaron whos no newcomer to evoking magical worlds onscreen (A Little Princess Y Tu Mama Tambien Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) feels like hes just hitting his stride. A movie about the last days of humanity that opens on Christmas Day may seem like a bleak choice for holiday viewing. But Children of Men is a modern-day nativity story thats far more moving and even in its way reverent than the current film by that name. Its also the herald of another blessed event the arrival of a great director by the name of Alfonso Cuaron. Correction Jan. 10 2007 The article originally misquoted the radio voice that opens the movie as saying ""Day 100"" instead of ""Day 1000."" (Return  to the corrected sentence.)

(Double Negative/Universal Pictures) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In the year 2027 the planet has plunged into war-torn chaos and the human race has been plagued by 20 years of female infertility. On the streets of London -- supposedly the worlds last center of relative calm -- illegal immigrants or ""fugees"" are herded into Guantanamo-style holding pens by officers from a department of ""Homeland Security."" Terror cells -- or possibly government itself propagating the fear of terror -- blow Fleet Street coffeehouses to smithereens. Trafalgar Square spills over with self-flagellating fanatics begging God for forgiveness. And those who can afford it still live in exclusive enclaves literally and figuratively walled off from reality. Unlike so many directors making movies about the future Alfonso Cuaron (together with the immeasurable aid of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and production designers Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland) doesnt offer us a radically new vision but rather one distinctly rooted in the present and he doesnt go out of his way to explain how we got there from here. Indeed the most terrifying thing about the coming dystopia proffered by Cuarons Children of Men is how familiar it seems.Through this landscape trudges a man named Theo (an excellent Clive Owen) whose life as a midlevel government bureaucrat belies his radical past. Once upon a time Theo had ideals -- he believed he could change the world -- until a flu pandemic wiped them out along with the life of his young son. Then Theos past comes rushing back to him Kidnapped off the street by the underground radicals known as the Fishes hes asked by his revolutionary ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) to help with an important mission. Theres this fugee an African girl called Kee (luminous newcomer Clare-Hope Ashitey) who needs urgent passage to the coast and Theo has family connections that can help get Kee the transit papers she needs. Plus theres 5000 pounds in it for him for his troubles.So he says yes and soon finds himself not only going along for the ride but reconnecting with that part of himself that he turned off long ago. (Its one of Cuarons most delicate touches that in the midst of all this Theo finds himself falling back in love with Julian.) But in the world of Children of Men idealism comes with a heavy price tag. En route to the coast Theo Julian and the Fishes are ambushed by an angry mob their windshield smashed and Julian mortally wounded. After which and for the rest of its running time Children of Men evolves into a breathless chase with Theo and Kee fleeing from one supposed safe house to another narrowly staying one step ahead of those who would prevent their rendezvous with a boat called the Tomorrow -- the supposed home of a progressive think tank called The Human Project -- that may be but a mythical Shangri-la. And why all the fuss about Kee? Well you see she just so happens to be eight months pregnant and a newborn baby could do a lot to further the revolutionaries cause.Children of Men which was loosely adapted by Cuaron and four other writers from the 1992 novel by British mystery writer P.D. James is the least heavily publicized of the major studio releases opening in Los Angeles this holiday season and maybe the least salable to audiences who get their dystopia fix from watching the evening news. But its also one of the years most imaginative and uniquely exciting pieces of cinema. Cuaron whose interests as a filmmaker seem to know no boundaries -- his previous credits include Y Tu Mama Tambien the lyrical childrens picture A Little Princess and the best of the Harry Potter movies -- has made that rarest of cinematic hybrids a brilliant genre entertainment that channels the spirit of a 1960s protest picture (the influence of the British faux-documentarian Peter Watkins is keenly felt); a political thriller in which the politics are never permitted to overwhelm the narrative; and a human drama that is about nothing less than the survival of the species. It suggests what that other recent vision of neofuturistic London V for Vendetta might have been had it actually grappled with the issues it raised rather than devolving into a glittering recruitment poster for terrorist martyrdom.

Sep. 13 600pm None of which is adequate preparation for the visceral grip of Cuarons direction which favors minutes-long uninterrupted camera takes -- some of them complex enough to make the opening shot of Touch of Evil look like amateur hour -- and the kind of elaborate sound recording associated with directors like Altman and Godard. (The echoes and resonances of the dialogue and the effects change noticeably as the characters surroundings change and Cuaron loves to home in on little eccentric details like the smacking made by the pair of dime-store sandals Theo dons for much of the film.) During the Wagnerian climax as London finally succumbs to the revolutionary tumult simmering in its streets Children of Men immerses into the thick of a war zone with the nerve-shattering hyperrealism of The Battle of Algiers or Paul Greengrass Bloody Sunday or the opening scenes of Saving Private Ryan. That sequence alone is assured a place in film-school classrooms for generations to come not because of Cuarons technical mastery (which is considerable) but because the scale of his visual derring-do is matched by the force of his humanism. Only the promise of new life it would seem can bring peace to this land though it may be Cuarons boldest and most resonant gesture that when a babys cry is finally heard the cease-fire proves fatally short-lived.CHILDREN OF MEN | Directed by ALFONSO CUARON | Written by CUARON TIMOTHY J.

The movie pitches us into the midst of a barbaric civil war in Sierra Leone in 1999 in which the profits from illegal or ""conflict"" diamonds sold on the black market to reputable European companies (a tiny splinter of the diamond trade) are used to fund arms on both sides of the war.A rare pink diamond coveted by all is the ""MacGuffin"" that sets the plot in motion. Its found and secretly buried by Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) a Men-de fisherman rounded up by marauding rebel forces and forced to work in their mines. They have also kidnapped his 14-year-old son to join their legions of brainwashed doped-up child soldiers and Solomon is counting on the money his diamond will bring to save his boy. The gem is equally coveted by diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) a tough amoral ex-mercenary from Zimbabwe for whom the diamond represents his ticket out of war-torn Africa. He promises to help Solomon rescue his family for a cut of the profits but he in turn needs the help of American journalist Maddy Brown (Jennifer Connelly). What she wants is Archers help in exposing the complicity of the Western diamond trade in the exploitation of the Third World. Their quest to retrieve the prize fuels the movies non-stop action.Fast-moving and brutally entertaining Zwicks movie from a Charles Leavitt screenplay is undeniably gripping but the by-the-book Hollywood melodrama (Will the cynical Archer discover a conscience? Will the aggressive journalist fall for his bad-boy charm?) doesnt always sit comfortably with the hellish images of hacked-off limbs machine-gun-toting child soldiers and teeming refugee camps. Theres something disturbingly formulaic about the ferociously well-staged outbursts of violence which arrive with a metronomic regularity that can seem more opportunistic than organic. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week But there is much to admire here. Zwick (""Legends of the Fall"" ""The Last Samurai"") who can err on the stolid side seems energized and engaged by the African milieu hes in peak form. DiCaprio transformed by his pitch-perfect South African accent is utterly convincing as a tough driven adventurer he exudes the masculine charisma he hadnt grown into in ""Gangs of New York."" Hounsou as always cuts an imposing sympathetic figure but it would be nice if for once he didnt have to play a noble moral paragon. ""Blood Diamond"" only skims the surface of many important subjects--the script doesnt begin to explain what the civil war was about. But if it opens a few eyes it will have done its job.London 2027. while the rest of the world has collapsed into chaos the United Kingdom conjured up in Alfonso Cuarons gripping but problematic dystopian thriller is hanging on by a militaristic thread. Terrorist bombs explode near Piccadilly. Immigrants and refugees are rounded up and held in pens awaiting deportation. The world is plagued by infertility its been 19 years since a baby was born. How do you live with no hope of a future for the species?The former activist Theo (Clive Owen) has succumbed to whisky-fueled numbness--until hes called upon by his ex-lover (Julianne Moore) now a radical leader fighting for refugee rights to get transit papers for Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) a young African woman who desperately needs to flee the country. Theres good reason for the urgency Kee is pregnant.Cuaron and his phenomenal cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki bring this bleak terrifying near-future to life in astonishingly tactile images. Cuaron (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" ) is one of the most exciting filmmakers around. He stages breathtaking action sequences one in which marauding thugs attack a car in the countryside is unlike anything youve seen.The filmmaking is so accomplished you wish it were matched by the script which was adapted from a P. D. James novel by Cuaron and four other credited writers. (That many scribes is never a good sign.) ""Children of Men"" is clearly more than a thrilling chase movie its meant to hold a barely distorted mirror to the world were living in now. But the characters are too sketchy for the political metaphors to resonate. (The exception is Theos old hippie mentor and friend beautifully played by Michael Caine a pot-smoking cartoonist whos retreated to his hidden home in the woods.) The infertility theme isnt explored in any depth. What exactly will it accomplish to get Kee out of the country? Since the future of mankind rests on this pregnant girl we want details. ""Children of Men"" leaves too many questions unanswered yet it has a stunning visceral impact. You can forgive a lot in the face of filmmaking this dazzling.If youve never seen a movie by the ghoulishly inventive Mexican director Guillermo del Toro you are in for a unique treat. Del Toro alternates between personal Spanish-language films such as ""Cronos"" and ""The Devils Backbone"" and American horror movies such as ""Mimic"" and ""Hellboy."" He also likes to mix high and low genres fantasy and reality in unexpected ways. Theyve never merged as hauntingly as they do in ""Pans Labyrinth"" which blends a fantastical fairy tale into the harsh reality of Francos Spain just after the civil war.The tale is told through the eyes of young Ofelia (played by 13-year-old Ivana Baquero) who is uprooted to a rural military compound when her sickly pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) marries a Fascist captain (Sergi Lopez) a harsh authoritarian cleansing the countryside of the last remnants of the Republican opposition. Her only friend is the housekeeper (Maribel Verdu from ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") who is secretly aiding the rebels. Lonely and frightened Ofelia retreats into a world of fantasy. In a maze in the woods she meets the ancient satyr Pan (Doug Jones) himself who challenges her to assume her true regal identity by undergoing a series of tests. Ofelia enters an underground kingdom of ogres monsters and spells; we see how this magical universe echoes her real life and how in this fable of innocence courage and evil the lessons of her fairy tale have to be applied in the real savage world.Suspended between the brutally graphic and flights of lyrical fancy ""Pans Labyrinth"" unfolds with the confidence of a classical fable one that paradoxically feels both timeless and startlingly new.The Third man."" ""Casablanca."" ""Notorious."" These great 1940s movies and many more will come to mind while youre watching ""The Good German"" and for good reason. Steven Soderberghs black-and-white melodrama may be brand new but it is a 40s movie right down to the typography used in the credits and the big Thomas Newman score. Set in partitioned Berlin just after the end of World War II it has an urbane war-correspondent hero (George Clooney) sent to Germany to cover the Potsdam conference a femme fatale who reeks ofDietrich-like doomed glamour (Cate Blanchett as Clooneys old flame now reduced to prosti-tution) a callow young American corporal (Tobey Maguire) milking the ruined city for black-market profits and international skullduggery involving Nazi scientists coveted by both the Soviets and the Americans.It sounds delicious what movie lover doesnt want to take this nourishing trip down memory lane? But the siren call of Old Hollywood can be as treacherous as this woman of mystery. Attempting a frame-by-frame duplication of Warner Bros. 40s filmmaking--even the extroverted acting style apes the period--Soderbergh has produced a movie so self-conscious that its drained of all life. ""The Good German"" written by Paul Attanasio from a Joseph Kanon novel promises a seduction but it plays like an academic exercise. Soderberghs skill intelligence and love for the genre are never in doubt. But as it turns out you cant play it again Sam.Clint Eastwood tells the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese side in ""Letters From Iwo Jima."" You can view it as a bookend to his recent ""Flags of Our Fathers"" or on its own. Either way its unprecedented a sorrowful and savagely beautiful elegy that can stand in the company of the greatest antiwar movies.Written in English which was then translated into Japanese by the young Japanese-American Iris Yamashita (who shares story credit with Paul Haggis) the screenplay brings to life four indelible characters all of whom know there is little chance theyll leave the island alive. General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) is the untraditional officer in charge who devised the 18 miles of tunnels that enabled the Japanese to withstand the American invasion for almost 40 days. He fights with the irony that having spent time in the United States before the war he reveres Americans. Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) is an irreverent young baker who just wants to stay alive to see his newborn daughter. The aristocratic Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) is a famous equestrian who competed in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. Private Shimizu (Ryo Kase) was trained in the elite military police but shipped off to Iwo Jima for disobeying orders to kill a dog. We see as well the old-guard officers who would shoot any soldier who tries to surrender and who when defeat seems inevitable order their men to die with honor by blowing themselves up with grenades. Eastwoods depiction of the horrors of war--and the atrocities committed on both sides--has a shocking intimacy.If ""Flags"" is more complex in its ambitions and structure the leaner simpler ""Letters"" is even more emotionally devastating. Superbly acted unblinking and unhysterical it looks beyond politics into the hearts and minds of the men we needed to call ""the enemy"" and lets us see ourselves.Movie trailers as we all know can be deceptive as anyone who went to ""Man of the Year"" expecting a knee-slapping Robin Williams satire can attest. The early glimpses of ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" starring Will Smith and his 7-year-old son Jaden had me fearing a tear-jerking blast of Hallmark card ""uplift."" The actual movie written by Steve Conrad and directed by the Italian Gabriele Muccino (""The Last Kiss"") is something quite different theres an inspirational hang-on-to-your-dreams message but it comes only at the very end of a long grim painful journey. Holiday cheer is not what this movie is offering.The movie is a fictionalized version of a true story about Chris Gardner (Smith) a smart struggling medical-supplies salesman in San Francisco in 1981 who dreams of becoming a stockbroker. In the film he takes an unpaid internship at Dean Witter--a huge and some might think irresponsible risk because only one intern will be chosen for a position at the firm. In debt with a fed-up wife (Than-die Newton) who walks out on him he ultimately loses his apartment and is thrown onto the streets with his son. They sleep in subway bathrooms and homeless shelters while during the day Gardner dons suit and tie and charms customers into investing with Dean Witter.Chris can be a fast-talking charmer but Smith is not coasting on his usual bouncy bravado here. He digs deep tapping into a ragged desperation and an urgent paternal protectiveness thats a far cry from ""Men in Black."" Newton doesnt stick around long but she makes a powerful impression as a woman knotted up with anger. And young Jaden Christopher Syre Smith is a natural. Muccino to his credit resists milking his million-dollar eyes for undue pathos.I respect the movies tact its honest exploration of homelessness its surprising refusal to exult in the rags-to-riches aspects of Gardners story but I cant say I was transported. Theres a repetitious one-note quality to the storytelling--the bone-density machine Chris sells gets stolen one too many times--that adds to the sense of oppression. I didnt see the ""20/20"" show about the real Chris Gardner that inspired the movie. But I suspect I would have come away more amazed and moved than I was by this honorable but dogged effort.Director Robert De Niro and screenwriter Eric Roths ""The Good Shepherd"" is nothing if not ambitious. In two hours and 40 minutes of grave hushed shadowy images it attempts to tell the story of the formation and transformation of the CIA. It begins with the agencys failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 loops back to the late 1930s when the Office of Strategic Services (the CIAs predecessor) was created and then takes us on a globe-hopping trip through the cold war.All this is filtered through the fictional story of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) a young Yale student plucked from the secret Skull and Bones society in 1939 to serve his country by spying on a suspected Nazi-sympathizing professor (Michael Gambon). The bright well-bred Wilson is an idealist but even as a young man theres something shut off about him he says little hides his emotions and is strangely passive in the presence of women even one as seductive as Clover (Angelina Jolie) whom he dutifully marries when she gets pregnant. Soon after he joins the OSS and whisks off to London and later Berlin not to return until his son is nearly 7. ""The Good Shepherd"" charts Wilsons devolution--and the agencys--from patriotic idealism to paranoid isolated ruthlessness. The cost of secrecy is his soul and his family.For the films mesmerizing first 50 minutes I thought De Niro might pull off the ""Godfather"" of spy movies. The tradecraft fascinates the sociology is astute the tense chess match between Wilson and his KGB counterpart ""Ulysses"" (Oleg Stefan) has an intricacy worthy of le Carre. But the unvaryingly solemn tone begins to wear and the elaborate flashback structure becomes confusing in the last act. Roths script is great on the cat-and-mouse games weak on the destruction of Wilsons marriage. Jolies character is barely coherent. And Roths choice to build an epic around a character as hooded as Wilson is risky its a testament to Damons skill and charisma that we care at all about this clenched careerist.Still even if the movies vast reach exceeds its grasp its a spellbinding history lesson. ""The Good Shepherd"" demands you watch it like a spy alert paranoid never knowing whom you can trust or who will stab you in the back.Shes vile beyond belief"" moans Ian (84-year-old Leslie Phillips) complaining to his friend and fellow veteran actor Maurice (74-year-old Peter OToole) about the young mulish working-class girl (Jodie Whittaker) belligerently ensconced in his flat as his ""nurse."" Maurice however whos always had an eye for the ladies takes one look at the sulky Jessie in her pink track suit and is enchanted.So begins the unlikeliest of May-December romances--his interest in her is sexual though he can no longer perform; her interest in him is strictly platonic--and so begins ""Venus"" a heartbreaking comedy that is simultaneously funny and sad raunchy and sweet funky and elegiac. These fresh unexpected juxtapositions are a specialty of the writer Hanif Kureishi (""My Beautiful Laundrette"") a sworn enemy of cliche.The once beautiful Maurice an elegant but blasphemous old thespian who still gets work playing deathbed cases on TV is a dream part for OToole. The lyricism and grace he had as Lawrence of Arabia have never left him--nor have the superb comic instincts of ""My Favorite Year."" Hes not playing himself here but his performance is haunted by our memory of the younger OToole. When his ex-wife played by Vanessa Redgrave spots Maurice in an old movie on TV and says ""Oh God how handsome you were"" we know exactly how she feels.Phillips is a delight as the prissy self-dramatizing Ian and Whittaker is a real find she makes Jessies ""Pygmalion"" -like blossoming utterly convincing. Under Roger (""Persuasion"") Michells brisk tender direction ""Venus"" works on every level. Its a bittersweet meditation on mortality a lovely valentine to the acting profession and a fine romance with no kisses.The aptly named Barbara Covett a stern resentful and lonely teacher at a shabby London secondary school is a master of both deception and self-deception which makes her a very dangerous woman and a pathetic one. Played with acid-tongued relish by Judi Dench in a radical departure from her roles as royalty shes a deliciously nasty piece of work.Barbara whose closest companion is her cat has fallen in love though she would never put it that way. The focus of her obsession is Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett) the new art teacher. Attractive young happily married with two children and a ""bourgeois bohemian"" sense of privilege Sheba is everything Barbara isnt--and everything Barbara wants to be.Imagine her shock when she discovers Sheba in the arms of her ardent 15-year-old student Steven (Andrew Simpson). But Barbara quickly gets over her horror when she realizes the glorious opportunity this presents. Now their fates will be forever interlocked. It will be our little secret she tells the shaken Sheba as long as you give up the affair.""Notes on a Scandal"" is a wicked delight. Adapted by playwright Patrick Marber from Zoe Hellers acclaimed novel its at once a comedy of cluelessness and class a melodrama of two women in the grips of wildly inappropriate obsessions and a ""Fatal Attraction""-style thriller. Its not easy to pull off the tales delicate mix of tones but Richard (""Iris"") Eyres zesty direction gets it just right. (Philip Glasss throbbing score however gets it wrong.) Blanchett whos played her share of queens has never been more intriguingly life-size. The restless willful Sheba is a wonderfully complex role a devoted mother married to a loving much older husband (Bill Nighy) she falls into her passionate affair with the cocky schoolboy having no real idea what shes doing or why. Hes just a callow average kid with raging hormones which makes the folly of her misplaced emotions all the more poignant--and funny. What happens when the scandal gets out Ill leave for you to discover. Even if you know the novel youll hang on every twist and turn.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Set in Britain in 2027 its a sort of sci-fi movie but its the films nervous and energetic verite style and creepy familiarity - not any wild vision of the future - that make it so involving. It helps too that Cuaron doesnt allow the writing or the performances most notably from Clive Owen and Michael Caine to sink amid the films futuristic detail and pointed ideological concerns.Children of Men is a clever and credible vision of London in the near future - a violent paranoid claustrophobic time when Britain is the only surviving nation and a fertility crisis means that no babies have been born for 18 years. The Department of Homeland Security has ordered a militarised police to arrest all illegal immigrants and dispatch them to a fortified compound at Bexhill-on-Sea. Meanwhile a rebel outfit of guerilla refugees (or fugees) known as The Fish loom threateningly in the background fighting for the rights of illegal immigrants and determined to cause major unrest. Cuarons smart trick is not to explain too much. Instead he leaps straight in to his story which is a good old-fashioned chase yarn thats gilded with some unobtrusive and cheeky social commentary. Its civil servant Theo (Owen) - hapless innocent reluctant hero and middling everyman - versus a miserable world in which his activist ex Julian (Julianne Moore) continues to take a political stand that hes long since abandoned. It helps that Cuarons prognosis of the future is gripping from the off. Theo (wearing a faded London 2012 sweater) is buying a coffee on Fleet Street when he notices a news report on TV. The newsreader (a voice recognisable from television today) announces that the worlds youngest person 18-year-old Diego has died in a street brawl. Its major news. The public weep. Theo takes a day off. And its no leap of the imagination to connect the reaction to Diegos death with the death of Diana in 1997. Its a moment thats symbolic of Cuarons film the future is not another planet but a familiar version of our own.The focus on migrancy and terrorism has an uneasy potency (not least when a bomb blows up Starbucks) and signals Cuarons determination to avoid distancing sci-fi tropes. Its a film that could have been ridiculous. When Theo finds himself unwitting guardian to the only pregnant woman on earth (Claire-Hope Ashitey) a Messianic tone threatens to infect the film but Cuaron backs off from stressing the Biblical overtones of Jamess tale; at one point he pointedly pulls the needle off a solemn John Tavener number and returns to the din of conflict as immigrants battle it out amid Bexhills ruins.In Cuarons hands this film emerges as quite an achievement both technically (look out for the impressive one-shot take that graces a battle scene late on; Cuaron resists the cut throughout) and dramatically (even Caine is amusing as Theos old mate Jasper a cardigan-wearing pot-smoking old sage). Its the directors boldness that makes it work. He doesnt bother with easy explanations choosing instead to plunge straight into the action shooting in a frenzied documentary style (always handheld) and employing only the most necessary of special effects. His London is ours. The same red buses crawl the streets only theyre older and more tatty. It rains incessantly and though the citys grey buildings are now adorned with moving-image advertising the majority of our cityscape endures from Brick Lane to the gloomy fly-overs of the East End. Theres fun to be had from all this - zebras roam St Jamess Park and Picassos Guernica now hangs in a (finally) refurbished Battersea Power Station. But this is no joke this is as real and as provocative as the future gets on screen.

The fact that the movie leaves you questioning at the end makes is so interesting. Ive read the book and that I will admit was pretty boring and felt very detached. The movie on the other hand is poignant and brutally beautiful. It brings up important questions about society and its values. The film may not be easy to understand for some.. so dont watch if your intellect doesnt surpass rom-coms and family filmsHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 6 2008MJHFeaturedThis was a truly awful film what a waste of nearly 2 hours. The film ended as abruptly as it started and left so many things unanswered it made me wonder what the point was in sitting through such doom and gloom. There is no genius in this film at all despite what others may say.

An often grippingly realized portrait of a not-so-futuristic Blighty in which fascism and infertility have become uneasy bed partners Alfonso Cuarons ""Children of Men"" is a fine but flawed exercise in dystopia. Much more effective when its a down-and-dirty actioner than when trying to grapple with the multitude of personal and political issues raised pic suffers from Clive Owens cold lead playing but gains some heart and soul from a kudosworthy wonderfully eccentric perf by Michael Caine. Skedded for a fall rollout in Europe and a December release in the U.S. this film looks likely to reap comfortable mid-range business. Set only 21 years in the future in November 2027 pic -- based on the 1993 novel by British writer P.D. James better known for her murder mysteries -- posits a world racked by infertility and social chaos in which terrorism is the norm. The U.K. however is a relative haven of peace -- ""The world has collapsed; only Britain soldiers on"" trumpets Brit TV propaganda -- and as a consequence immigration is out of control. Cuaron clearly got to know Blighty when shooting ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."" He portrays a grungy Orwellian country of perpetual security announcements prowling armed police garbage in the streets and illegal immigrants in cages -- not so different from the U.K. today and far more believable in every respect than in the feeble ""V for Vendetta."" Main difference from the present is that due to a sudden outbreak of female infertility there have been no births in the world since 2009. In a surprising demo of whats to come on the action front the opening sequence sees activist-turned-bureaucrat Theo Faron (Owen) almost blown to pieces by a terrorist bomb in central London. Using that as an excuse to take time off from his boring ministry job he travels out of town -- in a riot-protected train -- to visit his old friend onetime political cartoonist Jasper (Caine) who grows his own pot in the forest in which he lives. As soon as Theo gets back to London he is kidnapped by the terrorist group Fishes which campaigns for equal rights for all immigrants. Its leader turns out to be Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore) with whom Theo was a student activist 20 years ago and had a kid that died. She offers the broke and heavy-drinking Theo a sizable sum to get transit papers for an illegal refugee Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) whom theyre smuggling out of the country. Before he knows it Theo is on the run with Kee -- from both the authorities and renegade members of Fish -- as Kee turns out to be eight months pregnant with the first child on Earth in 18 years. Its finally left to him to smuggle Kee to shadowy offshore organization the Human Project a group of scientists dedicated to finding a cure for global infertility. Scripters Cuaron and Timothy J. Sexton dont seem very interested in filling in background. The outbreak of infertility is never explained the Human Project remains extremely lacking in detail and the global collapse of society is vaguely attributed to Islamic terrorism in newscasts caught. Indeed why so many immigrants would seek out the neo-fascistic U.K. is never made clear. On the personal side Theo and Julians backstory emerges only gradually and doesnt do much to warm up the rather icy chemistry between thesps Owen and Moore in their relatively few scenes together. In fact its the promising young Ashitey (from ""Shooting Dogs"") who effectively becomes pics femme lead as the relationship between Theo and Kee blooms on the run. Aside from the two sequences in which Theo visits Jasper pics dialogue hardly grapples with any of the broader issues thrown up by the script. Caines beatific perf in hippie spectacles and shoulder-length hair is treasurable and provides the two shafts of sunlight in the otherwise gray and wintry movie. Other cameos by well-known names are more hit and miss Peter Mullans turn as a pragmatic security guard adds extra spice to the socko final reels whereas Danny Hustons as a government minister seems to have been imported from a different movie. Pic more than delivers however on the action front -- not in bang-for-your-buck spectacle but in the kind of gritty doculike sequences that haul viewers out of their seats and alongside the main protags. Along with camera operator George Richmond who shot the entire movie handheld in 16 weeks Cuaron orchestrates several lengthy single takes that have a front-line feel. These include an attack in a car (a single take that required a special rig for the camera to get inside and around the car) and the movies showpiece climax. Latter single take recalls ""Full Metal Jacket"" in its landscape and ""Black Hawk Down"" in its intensity. Production and costume design have the utterly believable look of the near future like the present day but with a few tweaks. And Cuarons decision not to shoot in widescreen actually accentuates the movies gritty power. U.K. locations are all well used including some right in the heart of London.
