Clever premise and some chemistry between De Niro and Billy Crystal pushed the 1999 ""Analyze This"" into the winners circle and the novelty value is gone the second time around. The week after Tony Soprano fires his longtime psychiatrist on TV Robert De Niros mobster Paul Vitti makes an ill-advised return visit to his bigscreen shrink in ""Analyze That."" Clever premise and some antic comic chemistry between De Niro and Billy Crystal pushed the 1999 ""Analyze This"" into the winners circle and while the promise of more of the same will be enough for Warner Bros. to score another hit the novelty value is completely gone the second time around. Mercenary motives permeate every aspect of this lame affair which strains to come up with an excuse for gangland kingpin Vitti to be released from prison and get stuck once again with Crystals milquetoasty Dr. Ben Sobel. Easy-to-please viewers will derive a few light laughs from the twosomes new escapades but the yocks are a far cry from what auds expect from these actors or from helmer/co-writer Harold Ramis. Afraid of being whacked before his imminent release from Sing Sing Vitti fakes a complete nervous breakdown that includes the New York tough guy singing a medley of tunes from ""West Side Story"" surrounded by dozens of cons in the prison cafeteria. Whether the actor is just pretending not to be able to sing or De Niros voice really is this bad what emanates from his pipes is so ghastly that you dont blame the authorities for wanting to get him out of earshot at the earliest possible opportunity. In perhaps the most unconvincing scene of the year the FBI places Vitti in the custody of Sobel who is assigned to keep the hoodlum ""sane sober and gainfully employed"" for a month and whose house thus becomes a ""temporary federal institution."" On second thought perhaps more unconvincing are the jobs Vitti gets including those as a Manhattan Audi dealer a greeter at a swank Gotham eatery and a jewelry salesman. When these fail Vitti is hired as an ""expert"" consultant on a Mafia TV series ""Little Caesar"" that he finds patently phony. As Vitti weighs in on the authenticity of the shows dialogue (he cuts it all) and proceeds to bring in some of his old ""associates"" to lend a little reality to the background players pic veers precariously into the same territory so insipidly covered earlier this year in Warner Bros. ""Showtime"" in which De Niro played a cop drafted into service on a reality cop show. (Both films run 95 minutes and present evidence via extensive end-credits crackups that the stars had a lot more fun making the pics than auds can extract viewing them.) Providing what passes for dramatic conflict is a rivalry between mob families run by Patty LoPresti (Cathy Moriarty-Gentile) whos taken over Vittis operation since he went to prison and the threatening Lou ""The Wrench"" Rigazzi (Frank Gio). The anxiety Vitti suffered in the first outing is transferred here to the long-suffering Sobel who has just lost his father is harangued by his wife (Lisa Kudrow back to diminished returns) for returning Vitti to their lives and constantly pops pills that cause muscle-control problems prompting a sloppy eating scene in a sushi restaurant that early adolescents would find funny if they could get into this R-rated feature. All in all the hijinx in the movie are just as contrived and silly as those in the TV show-within-the-film. No one can hide the fact that theyre basically punching a very lucrative clock which makes for a fairly dispiriting experience. Performances are all broad and tech contributions average.

Directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by Peter Steinfeld Ramis and Peter Tolan 95 minutes. Rated R for language and some sexual content. Several theaters. OK lets take a quick little survey here Who among us was clamoring for a sequel to ""Analyze This"" the pleasant but not especially notable 1999 comedy featuring Robert De Niro as a neurotic mobster and Billy Crystal as his timid shrink? Anyone? Most of us I think enjoyed our 100 minutes or so with Paul Vitti and Ben Sobel but could have lived out our lives quite happily without ever seeing these characters again. Nonetheless here comes ""Analyze That"" for the holidays like those Christmas cards that keep arriving from people you barely remember and while the movies not dreadful its predictable and mostly listless. And it wastes the talents of many people who deserve better. Director Harold Ramis let us remember made one of the great American comedies of recent decades with ""Groundhog Day."" Here he gives us Robert De Niro grabbing his crotch or warbling selections from ""West Side Story."" Not that this is without charm (the songs that is not the crotch) but it feels random and flat -- its humor stemming from desperation rather than character and situation. Ramis cant seem to find a rhythm that works in ""Analyze That""; the movie veers from ultra-black comedy (were supposed to laugh when someone gets hurt or killed) to gentle realism to tired shtick never feeling quite comfortable anywhere. Crystal is likable as always as Sobel the shrink whos given custody of Vitti after the mobsters been sprung from jail but hes not doing anything new. (Hearing him sing though brought back pleasant memories of his Oscar-night medleys. Billy please come back to the Oscars and dont make any more sequels. If youre thinking at all of catching up with Harry and Sally in middle age -- stop now before its too late.) De Niro twists up his face and mugs for the back rows doing his best to make us forget what a brilliant actor he can be when hes fully engaged. And poor Lisa Kudrow whos got comic timing to rival anyone on screen today is given absolutely nothing to do but express wifely exasperation and she soon disappears from the movie entirely. Off negotiating with her agent I hope. Much of the zip in ""Analyze That"" comes from its supporting players moon-faced Joe Viterelli as the hulking mobster Jelly; Cathy Moriarty-Gentile as a Mafia mama bellowing in a voice that suggests crumpled sandpaper; and an unbilled Anthony LaPaglia playing a suave Australian actor playing a TV mobster (and turning in a nifty little imitation of De Niro). But they cant quite save the movies fundamental lack of energy -- its a cash cow (the original ""Analyze This"" took in more than 100 million domestically) rather than a labor of love and it just feels unnecessary. To keep alert during the slower bits of ""Analyze That"" (and there are many particularly in the second half) imagine the movie that this cast and director could have made. And then hope that someday they make it. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Alfred Sauchelli Jr. left and Joe Viterelli turn Billy Crystals world upside down in ""Analyze That. OVERANALYZED / Mobster/therapist formula is beyond help in tired sequel 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ANALYZE THAT Comedy. Starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Analyze That"" arrives in theaters today on a cloud of good will with the memory of ""Analyze This"" still fairly new. The original with Robert De Niro as a mob boss and Billy Crystal as his analyst was one of the best comedies of 1999. But the sequel does everything wrong with bad slapstick and schmaltz in place of character-based humor and genuine sentiment. Its a big disappointment a sure thing that turned out not to be. On the surface it would seem to have everything De Niro and Crystal ideally cast in tried and true roles; and Lisa Kudrow with her engaging comic timing as Crystals wife. Instead we get the spectacle of actors working with weak material and straining to imitate the sense and spontaneity of the original. Its less a bad copy than a replicant a soulless version of a living entity. In retrospect that might have been inevitable. The end of ""Analyze This"" didnt leave much room for a sequel. When last seen mob boss Paul Vitti (De Niro) cured of his inner demons was a reformed man on his way to jail while his analyst Ben Sobel (Crystal) was returning to his normal placid life. ""That"" begins three years later. Vitti in prison realizes that someone inside is trying to kill him. So he fakes a mental breakdown in order to be moved into the psychiatric ward. His feigned mental illness consists of stretches of catatonia interrupted by lively episodes in which he sings the soundtrack to ""West Side Story."" The sight of De Niro prancing around a rubber room singing show tunes is amusing but its also an early warning. The screenwriters desperate for any laugh they can get are willing to turn the movie and the characters into travesties. When Vitti is released from prison into Sobels custody our heroes are reunited and the clash of their personalities and backgrounds results in some funny situations. Vitti moves into Sobels house and next thing hes entertaining a call girl and keeping everyone awake half the night. SO MUCH FOR BEING SENSITIVE But what happened to Vittis wife and kids whom we met in ""Analyze This""? Theyre nowhere in ""Analyze That"" because the movies one trick is to get comic mileage out of Vittis vulgarity. So we get a cheap laugh when Vitti in a bathrobe carelessly flashes a staid luncheon party at Sobels house. And we get another set piece in which Vitti -- working as a car salesman -- becomes hostile when he cant close a sale. Despite life-changing psychotherapy in the first movie which unlocked his sensitivity Vitti in ""That"" is more of a lout than he ever was. The comic vignettes arent much and yet theyre all the movie has since the plot -- about rival gangsters conspiring to murder Vitti -- is without interest. One scene reunites De Niro with his ""Raging Bull"" co-star Cathy Moriarty-Gentile (she plays the head of a crime family) but even hard-core movie fans will have to force themselves to care. Three years later the main thing people remember about ""Analyze This"" is De Niros famous line ""You -- you -- you got a gift my friend"" which the new movie reprises several times. Whats harder to remember is that for all the laughs the earlier movie added up as a journey for the two leads The mobster came into his humanity while the analyst came into his manhood. The new movie lacks that extra dimension but maybe what it really lacks is a particular writer. ""Analyze This"" was co-written by playwright Kenneth Lonergan who has since gone on to write and direct the warm and charming ""You Can Count on Me."" Lonergan chose not to work on ""Analyze That"" and his absence is felt. The new movie could have used his gift for grounding absurd situations in the heartfelt motivations of his characters and for taking comic moments into the zone of pain and revelation. SNIPPETS OF FALSE SENTIMENT Director Harold Ramis tries to compensate for the missing emotional current in ""Analyze That"" by inserting moments of false sentiment. He tries to make a virtue of scenes that end flat without needed punch lines by having the actors play up drama that isnt there. But playing up nothing still leaves them with nothing. Audiences who loved ""Analyze This"" may have to see the new movie to believe just how empty it is. What theyll find is a profound difference between ""This"" and ""That."" . This film contains sexual situations violence and harsh and crude language.

"Analyze That Loses Touch With Its Inner Child washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Analyze That Loses Touch With Its Inner Child Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 6 2002 Heres all the analysis you need for ""Analyze That."" Fish out of water Funny. Forever funny. Fish in water Never funny. What would be funny about it? Its just a fish in er water. ""Analyze That"" begins with a blast of comic energy as it pursues the classic fish flubbing around on terra firma and then squanders all that laughter and goodwill for a dreary fish-in-H2O thing wasting Robert De Niro and Billy Crystals talent and too much of our time. At least they got paid. It begins where ""Analyze This"" left off in prison. De Niros gangster Paul Vitti is in Sing Sing where big guys with tattoos resembling cave art keep trying to perforate his liver with sharpened toothbrushes. Crystals Dr. Ben Sobel may be in a worse joint his own brain where the anger he feels at his now-dead father is suffocating him - while outside in apparently pleasant reality his shrewish wife (played at full-bitch pitch by Lisa Kudrow) is busy acting as warder. Shes so hostile you think maybe shes got a sharpened toothbrush somewhere. Dr. Sobel why dont you get your smile back by going on a cattle drive? Oh right you already made that movie. In any event ""Analyze That"" lurches into its highest comic gear when by feeble pretext the feds contrive to have the endangered mobster who is feigning insanity paroled into the care of the self-doubting eminently mild shrink who lives in a pleasant New Jersey neighborhood. O sole mio the laughs De Niros Vitti is fish Ubermensch Italian-style as deposited in the tepid burbs of Jersey. Hes so far out of water its a wonder his gills dont explode. He curses he threatens he punches he samples the purchased pleasures of the flesh (with a vulgar sleazy prostitute) he eats he stomps he smokes. He never moderates. He represents one tribe of man the utterly spontaneous. He does says thinks eats without a thought without reflection without hesitation. You can imagine the chaos such a monster of an id unleashes on any house run by Lisa Kudrow. When he kicks his ho out of the bedroom while Dr. Sobel downstairs is conducting a memorial get-together for his undearly departed dad the results are hysterical. Imagine the enraged Sonny Corleone kicking his way out of a dinner party in a Woody Allen movie. On the other hand Dr. Sobel is our friend the empathetic man. He never feels his own pain only everybody elses. He can rationalize any behavior except his own. His eyes leak the tears of human kindness. Hes been overeducated to the point of profound uselessness. He has lost touch with his physical self with his hungers with his strength and his aggression. He needs permission to breathe. Underneath the shenanigans of a plot that runs out of energy quickly you can see the psycho-emotional crossed trajectory the movie means to set up but doesnt really deliver. Paul of course must learn to moderate somewhat while Ben must learn to assert somewhat. Each must become a little more like the other guy. Thats interesting and quickly forgotten in a mess of subplots. One involves Pauls engagement in a gang war - talk about putting the fish back in the water - and one faction is led by De Niros old pal from ""Raging Bull"" Cathy Moriarty (who has added a hyphen and evidently married a Protestant so that the name now reads ""Cathy Moriarty-Gentile""). She still has the same gritty edge as she did in that great American movie and I wish the film had done more with her. But the whole Mafia thing - the other gang leader does a lame imitation of Brandos muted phlegmy Godfather voice - is pretty stale. Another subplot makes what I take to be a jab at ""The Sopranos"" which shares the gangster-shrink dynamic. Dr. Sobel gets Paul a gig as an adviser to a Mafia-based television show called ""Little Caesar"" The authentic gangster attempts to mold the performance of the inauthentic one played by Australian Anthony LaPaglia. De Niro and LaPaglia have almost no comic rapport and the script cannot come up with any gags for them except the obvious and unfunny. Theres also a florid producer named Raoul Berman (Reg Rogers) who may be a version of ""Sopranos"" creator David Chase. But he may not be. Hes clearly somebody but nobody outside of two screening rooms and one agency on either coast will know who. The movie just goes nowhere. Its stuck in that no mans land between comedy and banal movie mob action and it delivers on neither of these impulses with any force. The filmmakers also make a serious tactical error in separating Crystal and De Niro through most of the second half. Alone neither is half as funny as they are together. For gangsters with funny problems and a whiny shrink Ill take the great Tony S. any day of the week. ANALYZE THAT (R 95 minutes) - Contains profanity and mild violence. At area theaters.

"Analyze That In Need of Therapy washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Analyze That In Need of Therapy Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 6 2002 THE BEST thing about ""Analyze That"" is the title. Its the obvious and amusing choice for any movie to follow ""Analyze This"" the funny charming comedy of 1999 that starred Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. Beyond that theres nothing positive to say. ""That"" is so dull and awful you actually wonder if this is some kind of Andy Kaufmanesque in-joke a deliberate attempt to douse the spark that made the original film so enjoyable. Sadly the truth is far less interesting and far more familiar. This is a business-as-usual slump a corporate venture devoid of excitement and simply put into production for its recognition factor and I assume the video rental grosses. Ben Sobel (Crystal) a shrink is grieving because he just lost his father. At the service Bens cell phone rings. (Right in the middle of the funeral. Couldnt you just die?) Its his old pal Paul Vitti (De Niro) the mobster who came to him for all that therapy and gangster action in the last movie. Pauls in the slammer these days freaking out because someones trying to kill him. When Ben doesnt take the call Paul goes to Plan B. He fakes a psychotic attack so he can lure Ben. Paul wants out before hes iced. Seems theres a free-for-all out there in mobsterland with several players maneuvering for top-dog spot. Everyones got a reason to get rid of Paul. As far as the plot goes thats about as understandable and coherent as things get. From here on the patchwork script (by three credited writers and who knows how many uncredited re-writers) seems to have been made up each morning - maybe an hour before the actors came on set. The movies idea of hilarious is for Ben to repeat ""Im grieving its a process"" throughout the movie. Its not funny the first time or the second third or fourth. The one who should be grieving is Lisa Kudrow who plays Bens wife Laura. A great comedian - one little twitch of that expressive face can reduce anyone to hysterics - shes third fiddle in a bad comedy. No wonder her character seems exceptionally distressed. Without much of a narrative the movie simply follows the central element the wacky (or would-be wacky) relationship between Paul and Ben as the shrink tries to get legitimate work for Paul (including being a consultant for a gangster TV series) then helps him fight off the gangsters trying to kill him. One of those gangsters is played by Cathy Moriarty who some may remember starred with De Niro in the 1988 ""Raging Bull."" In that Martin Scorsese classic De Niro played heavyweight boxer Jake LaMotta. Moriarty played his long-suffering wife Vickie. There was stunning electricity between them then. Which makes it all the more depressing to watch those two performers limp and struggle their way through scenes together like blinded aging bears. Well that was then. Its too bad the filmmakers thought ""That"" was now. ANALYZE THAT (R 95 minutes) - Contains sexual content violence and obscenity. Area theaters.

It doesnt take much analysis to realize that the films lead Robert De Niro is no longer a very ""dangerous"" actor. How many surprises can he really offer when That is a by-the-numbers extension of 1999s Analyze This? Credit the professionalism of De Niro and Billy Crystal -- still an inspired comic teaming -- for generating chuckles of varying intensities in the scenes they share. Movie review Analyze That ( out of four) Stars Robert De Niro Billy Crystal Lisa Kudrow Cathy Moriarty-Gentile Director Harold Ramis Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for language a scene of sexuality and some violence Opens Friday nationwide We begin with Mob slob De Niro managing to spring himself from prison by faking mental instability breaking into a medley of West Side Story standards. Authorities agree to release him to therapist Crystals care which extends to living in the home of the therapist and his wife (Lisa Kudrow). Soon a boisterous hooker joins De Niro in a spare bedroom. Later in a flappy bathrobe he accidentally exposes himself to houseguests. The rest is a scattershot assemblage of situational gags that are at least preferable to the spiritless armored-truck robbery that sinks the movies climax. De Niro tries to become a car salesman; he insults the customers. Then hes a restaurant greeter insulting the patrons. Amazingly he ends up as a technical adviser on a crime-based TV show. Say isnt this just what the actor did only last March in Showtime another comedy from Warner Bros. that teamed him with another comedian (Eddie Murphy)? Even if you end up laughing at parts of the movie -- and several members of my audience did -- its staleness may nag. Though the picture falls apart whenever the two leads arent on screen together you can argue that That isnt that inferior to its predecessor. But in 1999 The Sopranos had only begun to become part of the entertainment vernacular. Three years later even a better Mob farce would seem like just another glob of mold on De Niros resume of late City by the Sea Showtime The Score 15 Minutes. De Niro Crystal Kudrow hoods hijacks and limited hilarity. You pay your money and know just what youll get a calculated commercial comedy to pay those Christmas multiplex rents when other screens must play less popular movies destined to win all the awards. In other words it doesnt take a second to analyze this projects reason for being.

Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com Reviews archive  EW.com Movie reviews (CNN) -- The old saying that sequels rarely live up to the originals has become a cliche. But theres often a lot of truth to cliches. There are more egregious examples than ""Analyze That"" the sequel to ""Analyze This"" but ultimately the premise is too thin to support two films. In the original Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro were hilarious as a neurotic psychotherapist and the insecure mob boss seeking treatments for panic attacks. Everyone involved in that first project -- from the two stars to the writer Peter Tolan and writer-director Harold Ramis -- all swore they wouldnt do a sequel just for the sake of doing it. Well the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Stir crazy The films in trouble right from the get-go due to a decidedly half-baked setup. Paul Vitti (De Niro) is serving time in Sing Sing where hes on the verge of a nervous breakdown due to threats against his life. Meanwhile on the outside his former shrink Dr. Ben Sobol (Crystal) is having an identity crisis brought on by the death of his overbearing father. But when Vitti suddenly begins to burst into songs from ""West Side Story"" -- De Niro singing ""I Feel Pretty"" while in solitary confinement sounds a whole lot funnier than it really is -- Sobol is forced ( Why? Who knows?) to intervene. For reasons beyond the power of logic the FBI and the prison authorities decide the only solution is to release Vitti into Sobols custody. Lisa Kudrow playing the Crystal characters wife is underutilized says Paul Clinton. Of course Vitti is faking his mental collapse. Unfortunately once credibility has been stretched to the limits by this bogus mind-blowing release from the slammer the storyline hits a brick wall. Its as if the filmmakers expended so much energy on the ridiculous first 20 minutes of the film they ran out of ideas what to do with the main characters once they head back to Sobols house where they meet with the good doctors less-than-welcoming wife Laura once again played by an underutilized Lisa Kudrow. The first piece of business is finding Vitti gainful employment. His initial effort is mildly amusing as a used-car salesman who tries to close a deal by pointing out that the trunk of a particular car is big enough to fit three bodies comfortably. This minor yuck is followed by a series of increasingly non-funny scenes as a hapless maitre d. He finally finds work as a consultant on a TV series about -- what else -- a mobster. At this point Anthony LaPaglia makes a mildly amusing non-credited appearance as the shows leading character. Things look up for a moment when Cathy Moriarty-Gentile makes her appearance as Patty LoPresti a mob widow who has taken over as the new head of the Vitti crime family while Paul was in the big house. This is the first time De Niro and Moriarty have been on screen together since ""Raging Bull"" 22 years ago but dont get your hopes up. Their scenes together are as flat as last nights champagne. Caught in the muddle De Niro is teamed with Cathy Moriarty for the first time since 1980s ""Raging Bull."" A rival gang is now trying to take over the Vitti familys turf LoPresti is trying to protect her territory the Feds are all over everybody Crystals character is running around in circles with his wife in close pursuit and somehow in the middle of all this Paul is planning a bank job. If youre still paying attention -- or even still in your seat -- things are so muddled by this time that the only thing that you can possibly hope for is a gigantic St. Valentines massacre. Unfortunately it doesnt happen and the film continues to limp along toward its lackluster conclusion. De Niro once again seems to be having a grand old time sending up his tough-guy image and Crystal looks like hes having a ball mugging along with the master. Unfortunately the result is just a bunch of one-liners strung together of which some work and some dont. The actual story never gets off the ground. De Niro and Crystal are capable of being a great comedic team but just like any other actors theyre only as good as the script -- and this one is decidedly underwelming. ""Analyze That"" opens nationwide on Friday and is rated R.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr C- Analyze That Genre Comedy; Starring Billy Crystal Robert De Niro Lisa Kudrow Anthony LaPaglia Cathy Moriarty; Director Harold Ramis; Author Harold Ramis Peter Steinfeld; Release Date Wide 12/06/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted December 4 2002 -- 1200 AM EST Theres a sequence in Analyze That that was born to be a laugh riot and the fact that its not tells you how used-up the filmmakers must feel. Paul Vitti the high-anxiety Mob boss played by Robert De Niro (who grimaces so much that hes starting to look like the mask of tragedy) has just been released from Sing Sing into the custody of his psychotherapist Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal). The shrink tries to get him to go legit and the movie presents Vitti in a series of ordinary and therefore demeaning jobs. Theres a good bit in which hes a luxury-car salesman abusing picky customers who demand to see the boss (""Heres the boss"" he yells grabbing his crotch). Then hes a maitre d giving special attention to his Mob pals (not funny) then a jewelry salesman who lies about a diamond (really not funny). The whole Vitti-goes-straight gag goes straight into the toilet. Watching ""Analyze That"" it doesnt take long to get the sinking sensation that youre seeing a shadow of a former joke. The De Niro-Crystal comedy team is no longer even tethered to the notion that Vitti needs therapy. The two are just stereotyped buddy oddballs - the movie might as well have been called ""The Goombah and the Jewish Guy."" ""Analyze That"" has little of the snap and verve of ""Analyze This"" yet I think I have a clue as to why Harold Ramis directed this comedy of violence as if he were in traction. When the first film came out its conceptual overlap with ""The Sopranos"" could be passed off as a coincidence. But four seasons of the visionary HBO Mafia psychodrama have made Paul Vitti look like even more of an old-school linguini-with-blood-sauce cliche. When hes hired to ""advise"" a TV show about a mobster the flat-witted setup with its unfortunate echo of the De Niro-Eddie Murphy ""Showtime"" expresses nothing so much as fear and envy of ""The Sopranos."" Its not just that Tony Soprano is richer darker cooler and scarier. The dude gets more laughs.

"Analyze That | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; analyze-that ) Analyze That (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Analyze That delivers its share of amusing moments but when it comes to inventive or inspired comedy it is lacking. The movie is funnier than a lot of whats available in multiplexes but thats more a condemnation of the sad state of big screen humor than it is a rousing endorsement of this motion picture. Theres nothing horribly wrong with Analyze That but theres nothing remarkable about it and in terms of its overall enjoyability quotient it falls short of the mark set by its predecessor Analyze This. Its ironic that one of the best comedic performances given this year comes not from noted funnymen Robin Williams Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler (all of whom are spending time exploring serious acting) but from dramatic actor Robert De Niro. As was the case in Analyze This the primary reason to see the movie is De Niro whose deadpan lampoon of his gangster image is Analyze Thats high point. However while De Niro is great and the rest of the cast including Billy Crystal Lisa Kudrow and Joe Viterelli delivers solid support the material has a lukewarm lackluster feel. Instead of frequent belly-laughs I experienced occasional amused chuckles. I expect more from director Harold Ramis who has been responsible amongst other projects for Ghostbusters (which he co-wrote) and Groundhog Day (which he co-wrote and directed). The film picks up several years after the original Analyze This. Mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is in prison and fearing that someone is trying to whack him he pretends to have a nervous breakdown. This results in his alternately singing showtunes and falling into a catatonic state. Psychiatrist Ben Solol (Billy Crystal) his ex-therapist whose father has just died is summoned to Sing Sing to examine Paul. When he pronounces the prisoner to be genuinely ill the Feds decide to release Paul but on one condition a Ben has custody. Of course once the two of them are on the way back to Bens New Jersey home Paul reverts to form. For a while he tries to go straight experimenting with getting a real job (working at a car dealership tying his hand at being a maitre d). Ultimately however the pressure to get back into the business of organized crime is too great and hes soon using his new position as a cable TV show consultant as a front for illegal activity. When Analyze This was released a number of critics noted similarities between the movies central premise (a mob bigwig going to a shrink to stop panic attacks) and that of a new HBO series called ""The Sopranos."" Analyze That openly lampoons the successful television drama by having Paul earn his legitimate bread and butter by providing a sense of authenticity to the Sopranos-like ""Little Caesar"" which stars Anthony LaPaglia in the James Gandolfini part. Some of the best laughs come on and around the ""Little Caesar"" set. Others successfully humorous moments include De Niro belting out tunes from West Side Story and Bens rigorous examination to determine whether Paul is faking catatonia. (This scene also provides the best outtakes which are shown over the end credits.) Analyze That is at its weakest when it wanders into dramatic territory as when circumstances force Ben to come to grips with the powerful influence his dead father had upon his life. This part of the movie doesnt work and serves largely to pad out the running length. For the most part Analyze That is a genial and unremarkable comedy with its share of tepid laughs. Its a significantly weaker offering than its edgier livelier older brother and carries the scent of something produced exclusively because there was money to be made.
