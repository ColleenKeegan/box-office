Starring Alex Pettyfer Timothy Olyphant Teresa Palmer Dianna Agron Callan McAuliffe Kevin Durand Director D.J. Caruso Running time 144 Release Opened Feb 18 2011  Editorial Review Movie review I Am Number Four By Sean OConnell Thursday February 17 2011 Sorry ""I Am Number Four"" but I Am Not Impressed. Let me give you four reasons why  The mythology adapted from Pittacus Lores young-adult science-fiction novel comes across as scatterbrained and silly on screen.  Outside of a combative finale set in and around a high school the computer-generated special effects are generic and disappointing.  The tattooed and fanged villains resemble rejects from the critically acclaimed but long-deceased ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" television series.  The young ""Four"" cast appears to have been plucked from an Abercrombie amp; Fitch catalogue - which isnt an issue until you realize that the characters theyre playing are about as thin as the pages in that Gen-Y fashion Bible. Still want to try it moviegoer? Let me help dissuade you. Unoriginal and woefully half-baked ""Number Four"" plays out as such. Number Four (Alex Pettyfer) is a ruggedly handsome alien whose home planet Lorien was destroyed by the Mogadorians an evil race of extraterrestrial hit men sporting ankle-length trench coats and jet-black tattoos on their shaved heads. Picture the offspring of Count Dracula and Neo from ""The Matrix"" and youre halfway there. Four is one of nine Legacy children Lorien natives who were sent to Earth to escape their planets destruction (even though legend claims that the nine possess enough power to you know vanquish the Mogadorians). Hoping to kill before they get killed the Mogadorians have traveled to our planet successfully subtracting Numbers One through Three from the equation. Four knows hes next so his Lorien guardian Henri (a paycheck-collecting Timothy Olyphant) orders him to disappear until his latent powers fully manifest. Hes told to avoid contact with humans remain in hiding and above all else stay off the Internet. Because we must assume the Mogadorians love Facebook and Twitter. And how does Four choose to stay invisible? By enrolling in his neighborhood high school of course Nothing says ""stay off the grid"" quite like romancing the towns cutest babe (Dianna Agron) or sticking up for the schools nerdiest student (Callan McAuliffe) when hes bullied by the arrogant varsity quarterback (Jake Abel). ""Number Four"" suffers from multiple-personality disorder. Sometimes it wants to be ""Dawsons Creek."" Other times it aspires to be ""The X-Files"" or ""Fringe."" Director D.J. Caruso married film noir with teen angst in 2007s ""Disturbia"" so you can understand why Dreamworks studio execs would gamble on the filmmaker combining a credible teen-sensitive drama with a far-fetched science-fiction premise. But he cant. ""Number Four"" samples heavily from John Hughes and Ray Bradbury but all attempts at bridging their vastly different worlds fail miserably. The screenplay credited to three writers does Caruso no favors. The convoluted science-fiction soap opera makes up new rules as it stumbles along (largely to explain away plot holes) then ignores the rules it previously established (largely to cover up even bigger plot holes). Details are revealed then overlooked. Henri carries around a box that were told houses a secret handed down by Fours deceased father. But the box is never opened and nothing comes of whats inside. ""Number Four"" also never bothers to answer why on earth (or on Lorien for that matter) Four needs to take classes if hes on the run. Is he planning to get his degree? Enter the workforce? Even if ""Four"" solved those riddles theres still no getting around the fact that its hero is pretty lame. His glowing hands have the power to light up a dark room. Wow. In one pivotal scene hes able to jump-start a dead car battery by pointing his palm at the dashboard. Are you excited yet? Number Fours really more of a battery than a super-charged savior. If you really want to see proper treatment of similar material save your cash until Matthew Vaughns anticipated prequel ""X-Men First Class"" opens in June. Because Im willing to wager the price of admission that its 10 times better than ""Number Four."" Contains intense sequences of violence and action as well as objectionable language.

Forgettable pretty-boy Alex Pettyfer plays John the high-school tearaway who just happens to be one of the last members of a benevolent alien race which has been all but wiped out by the evil Mogadorians. These scar-faced psychos have hunted down and killed three of Johns fellow survivors and guess whos next... Crammed with daft names kooky chicks self-regarding hunks and flashy CG effects I Am Number Four is pure by-the-numbers teen gratification. DJ Carusos direction is overkeen and annoying the bland script sets up painfully obvious character conflicts and follows them to their predictable conclusions and only an enjoyably bonkers whizz-bang finale packed with monsters ray guns and slo-mo flying saves the film from total tedium. The door is left wide open for a sequel but its hard to imagine therell be much call for it.

Personally I dont think all things supernatural need to be compared to Twilight just because it has been so successful...there was a world of sci-fi prior to that believe it or not. My thoughts on the film? Well I enjoyed it for what it was but if I were to be very critical I would say it was lacking any character depth and there was no real chemistry going on between the characters either. I do recommend it though but mainly to who it is aimed at - KIDSFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 15 20113012FeaturedIts for kids so lighten up on the serious reviews anyone older than that.

I way preferred this to the slow and dreary Twlight series. Alex Pettyfer would be better served by villainous roles as opposed to smarmy leads like this (see Tormented). I enjoyed the ""motive-less"" intergalactic baddies childish sense of humour (Kevin Durand) and the fianl showdown.

I thoroughly enjoyed it my son is 12 and loved it. It is full of action from start to finish with a nice storyline will like to see a sequel to it in the near future. My son asked if we could buy the video as soon as it comes out. Great entertainment and cannot understand some of the reviews maybe the person who walked out after 40 minutes should have sat through it and lighten up a little it is for a teen or younger audience and is an entertaining film which I think was the aim of making it a 12A. As adults of kids this age we dont want extreme violence and too heavy a storyline anyway at least then the kids know what is going on and not getting bored.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 26 2011ZoeFeaturedI completely disagree with this review. Whilst Twilight was about soppy love and nothing else this film was fast paced and had great action scenes. Yes it may be for a specific young adult audience but it was definitely entertaining. There is no comparison with this film to Twilight if you see it as a completely unrelated film which it is. It is also told from the guys point of view and you dont really see much of Sarah in it. Also John is only just realising his powers so he isnt so egotistic and scary like Edward Cullen. Sorry but it is not fair to put it in the same category as Twilight because people would judge it straight away and not want to watch it if they dislike Twilight.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89533/i-am-number-four.html,200,iamnumberfour1,iamnumberfour,timeout

Caruso; Author Alfred Gough Miles Millar Marti Noxon; Release Date Wide 02/18/2011; Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Posted February 22 2011 -- 1200 AM EST The sci-fi-teen romance I Am Number Four is witless insultingly derivative muddy-looking and edited in the hammering epileptic style that marks so many films produced as this one is by Michael Bay. And for all that the movie is just you know ordinary harmless -- a wiki-built movie engineered to unspool and vanish from memory even before you check your smartphone. Indeed it?s a wiki-built movie adapted from a wiki-built young-adult novel written by the pseudonymous Pittacus Lore nom-de-fiction-factory of compromised memoirist James Frey and his hired wordsmith Jobie Hughes. Google deep enough and you may find that the whole enterprise is the programmed work of Watson the Jeopardy-winning computer. Who is Number Four? The numerically-named fellow (every single character might as well take a number so blandly interchangeable are they) is a Cute New Guy (former model Alex Pettyfer) who pulls into Smallville Forks Paradise Ohio with his father-substitute/guardian (Timothy Olyphant) and enrolls in the local high school. There it becomes clear that the CNG is Superman a vampire an endangered stranger with special powers from another planet. Four -- his street handle is John Smith -- falls in love with Lois Lane Bella Swan the school?s good girl/artsy photographer (Glee?s Dianna Agron). But that?s a problem because he?s being hunted by CGI monsters aliens with bad teeth and the school?s bullying quarterback. So Four runs a lot and fights and uses his special powers and so forth. At the end Four is on the road again leaving open the possibility of another installment. Press the Empty Trash button now.

Alex Pettyfer and Teresa Palmer star in ""I Am Number Four."" Photo John Bramley AP I Am Number Four 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In I Am Number Four the title character is a tousle-haired alien teen (Alex Pettyfer) from the planet Lorien . Hes on the run from Bad Bald Aliens with Gills from the planet Mogador whove already whacked the Cute Alien Teens numbered One through Three and are working their way to Nine. Four up next flees to Ohio where he makes googly eyes with a pretty earthling (Dianna Agron) and pretends to be just your average hunky American kid with superpowers. Now this isnt exactly Oscar bait unless the Academy starts handing out statues for Best Use of a Multiple of Two in a Movie Title. And honestly why not because why should the Coen brothers get all the love? With that in mind Ive decided to hand out a few awards of my own devising. Such as Best Beginning and Ending in a Movie with a Really Boring Midsection Directed by D. J. Caruso I Am Number Four is based on the best-selling youth novel (the first in a series supposedly) by James Frey and Jobie Hughes. It opens well closes with a bang -- theres some awesomely destructive computer-generated imagery - and has lots of soppy adenoidal dialogue in between. Too many googly eyes. Not enough energy or imagination. Snore. Best Juxtaposition of a Hot Angry Australian with an Exploding Fireball Shes a mystery woman played by Teresa Palmer and shes one of the reasons for the previous award. Never have I seen long blond curls bounce more angrily than hers near the start. When she appears again later on youll wonder What movie is she from? Can I watch that instead? Best-looking rip-off ofTwilightandSmallville Ah to be young handsome and able to run really fast without crashing into trees. Best Performance by an Actor fromJustified That would be Timothy Olyphant who brings something resembling gravitas to the role of Number Fours determined warrior guardian Henri. Best Performance by an Especially Large Actor fromLost Kevin Durand shows up hilariously as one of the Bad Bald Aliens with Gills outfitted with nasty little piranha teeth and Keanu Reeves trench coat from The Matrix. Best Example of Flashlights for Hands One of Fours powers used to vanquish a jerky football player. Best Performance by Alien Flying Squirrels Theyre huge theyre lizardlike and they nosh on frozen turkeys - and Cute Alien Teens (when available). Best Manifestation of O.C.D. in an Extraterrestrial Im pleased to present this to the Bad Bald Aliens with Gills who insist on picking off the Cute Alien Teens in strict sequential order. Why they do this I dont know. Best Fight to the Death in a High School Shower To say too much would spoil the fun but an Alien Flying Squirrel is involved. And finally ... Best Reason to Stay Home and RentDisturbia Granted I Am NumberFour is a little better and makes loads more sense than Eagle Eye Carusos most recent vehicle for comely young actors in peril. But neither one has the sass and pluck of Disturbia.

"I Am Number Four review A dull film about a teen alien in love |       NJ.com comments I Am Number Four review A dull film about a teen alien in love Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 18 2011 at 715 AM View/Post Comments DREAMWORKSJohn played by Alex Pettyfer studies his newfound abilities in ""I Am Number Four."" Some movies are popcorn pictures. ""I Am Number Four"" is an Excedrin Extra Strength movie. Really I could feel the migraine coming within the first five minutes as a jungle hut is invaded by characters we cant see fighting strangers we dont care about and the entire screen explodes in blue light red fireballs and eardrum-punishing noise. Sure its exciting. So would be having two guys burst into your bedroom with an air horn and a couple of highway flares. But I dont know that youd like it and I doubt youd want to pay 12 for the privilege. Some will though particularly in the Young Adult set. ""I Am Number Four"" is the movie of a popular novel about an exiled alien teen being chased by invading alien men. He stays on the move with his pretend father regularly changing names and high schools to elude his enemies. But then he meets a ""normal"" girl. And since his race mates for life he falls hard. If it sounds familiar it should -- its basically ""Twilight"" with ray guns. The crucial difference is that like the best popular authors Stephenie Meyer never condescended to her audience or her material; she believed what she wrote. You get the feeling though that the people behind this project believed only in its marketing potential. And why not? One of the original novels co-authors was James Frey the desperate disgraced auto-faux-ographer of ""A Million Little Pieces."" The nasty aliens are fun -- they have long black coats wild Maori-style tattoos and a withering contempt for the soft sweet sickness that is American society. If it werent for their crimson gills youd almost think they were grad students. But Alex Pettyfer -- a child actor turned model turned self-satisfied hunk -- isnt much except blond hair and good cheekbones as our hero. He takes his shirt off a lot but Taylor Lautner has nothing to worry about -- except what hes going to do after those ""Twilight"" movies end. Meanwhile the rest of the cast -- particularly Dianna Agron of ""Glee"" as Pettyfers new sweetheart -- is even blander. The few actors who are better than that make their exits early or appear too late -- like Teresa Palmer another alien but one with a broad Aussie accent and a taste for motorcycles and tight leather. Palmers a welcome addition but shes too tough for this movie -- the effects are grade-school silly (Pettyfer shoots blue light from his hands like hes clutching a fistful of glow sticks) and theres no real threat. Stab one of the evil aliens with a special knife and he just turns to ashes. Its too bad. Director D.J. Caruso did one wonderfully strange movie (""The Salton Sea"") one successful one (""Disturbia"") and one stupid one (""Eagle Eye""). He never has done one that was this dull before. Or this needlessly loud. Give it two stars. And if you do go be sure to give yourself two aspirin. Ratings note The film contains violence and some strong language. I Am Number Four (PG-13) Disney (110 min.) Directed by D. J. Caruso. With Alex Pettyfer Dianna Agron. Now playing in New Jersey.

Caruso Genre Sci-Fi Action Running Time 110 minutes PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and for language. With Alex Pettyfer Timothy Olyphant Teresa Palmer Dianna Agron Watch Clips Blending In Blending In Credit Buena Vista Pictures Pack Your Stuff Pack Your Stuff Credit Buena Vista Pictures Number Six Number Six Credit Buena Vista Pictures Lets nip this one in the bud shall we? D.J. Carusos cynical new teen flick I Am Number Four is adapted from the first volume of a young-adult fiction series -- Lorien Legacies -- and has been conceived by producer Michael Bay and his buddies at DreamWorks as the start of a blockbuster movie franchise. From all appearances this first installment cost them dozens of dollars to make so if fewer than say 25 people go this weekend maybe theyll decide not to make a sequel. It wants to be a sort of extraterrestrial-high-school-superhero-at-Twilight series with pretty-boy Alex Pettyfer as Edwa ... um John Smith otherwise known as Number Four. (Of nine Lord help us.) Number Four is a slender blond teen hunk whos hiding out in Paradise Ohio because there are snarling tattooed Mogadors (dont ask) tracking and killing ""his kind."" While waiting for these Mogadors to show up Number Four spends his time romancing a plucky local (Glees Dianna Agron) who already has a hot-tempered all-American boyfriend (Jake Abel). Think of it as Twilight-lite except that in this one the vampires have gills. OK technically the Mogadors arent vampires but they wear black trench coats have pointy teeth and only seem to do their dirty work at night -- the cover of darkness presumably being as useful for special-effects digitizers as it is for aliens. Oddly though theyre otherwise pretty sloppy both in personal hygiene and in work habits the Mogadors are intent on killing off Numbers One through Nine in strict numerical order. Number Three gets dispatched during the credits. (Numbers One and Two are long gone presumably to be dealt with in prequels.) And now the trench-coated dudes are hot on the trail of our hero though Australian-accented Number Six (Teresa Palmer) seems a more convenient target; shes shadowing them even as theyre shadowing him. I Am Number Four is adapted from The Lorien Legacies the sci-fi young adult series from the James Frey fiction factory. John Bramley/Buena Vista Pictures hide caption toggle caption John Bramley/Buena Vista Pictures Dunno where Number Five is. Dont much care either. Along for the ride is dweeby underclassman Sam (Callan McAuliffe) because well what teen series doesnt need a nerd? Sam settles in quickly as Number Fours number two a sidekick whose chief function seems to be to smile and mutter ""Coooool"" when hes allowed to use alien hardware. And the Mogadors use lots of hardware -- big plastic-looking guns that blast buildings and cars to kingdom come but never seem to do much to our numbered heroes (who favor long knives for some reason). Then again the writers have conferred superpowers on the Numbered Number Three could hurtle like a rocket through jungly underbrush Six can throw lightning bolts in school hallways and Fours palms have recently started glowing when he gets excited. Its helpful in power outages though a trifle embarrassing in class. He can also start cars by concentrating really hard but only after his failure to do so has doomed a guardian (a woefully wasted Timothy Olyphant) whose own powers include intense caution but not a lot of common sense. I Am Number Fours CGI sequences are murky and dark its performances negligible its script genuinely inept. There is I should note a puppy which arguably keeps the film this side of completely unbearable but just barely. Heres hoping its days are numbered.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 18 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 17 2011 229PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Say this for I Am Number Four Its blessedly free of any original sins. Instead theyre all copied. Here a little Superman there a bit of Spider-Man now its Twilight with aliens then its a spaghetti western with trucks - this thing borrows more heavily than an investment bank in an unregulated market. Or maybe I should put a more positive spin on the proceedings. Think of the movie as a cinematic mattress and for those of you who take comfort from the familiar enjoy the slumber. Once again a gifted child descends from a great intergalactic distance to make his home on Mother Earth. Actually in this arithmetic there are nine such children escapees from the planet Lorien and on the lam from their arch-enemies a band of extraterrestrial baddies known as Mogadorians. Being baddies they wear Sergio Leone duster coats and sport tattoos on their heads that would be the envy of Mike Tyson. Anyway the focus here is on but one of the youthful Loriens who in case you hadnt guessed ranks Number Four on the hit-list and in his new earthly digs chooses to go by the name of John Smith. Apparently imagination is not one of his superpowers. We first spot the now teenage John (Alex Pettyfer) and his anxious guardian Henry (Timothy Olyphant) on the sandy beaches of Florida at least until the ""Mogs"" pick up their scent prompting a hasty retreat to yet another hideout. This time its to the Midwestern blandness of Ohio where our lad does what teen aliens typically do in these circumstances - enroll in high school. Once there he continues to follow form to the letter falling in love with Sarah the sensitive girl (Dianna Agron) befriending Sam the science nerd and taking advantage of the class bullies to hone his inchoate powers. These latter include the standard trope of leaping tall buildings in a single bound plus something that appears to involve corralling lightning in the palm of his hand and then getting all telekinetic on us. But dont quote me on that - Im woefully undereducated in matters telekinetic. To this point director D.J. Caruso manages to ascend to the level of competence striking a nice balance between the competing genres keeping the high-school angst almost real and the special effects credibly muted. Competent too are Pettyfer and Agron as the loving principals - they dont exactly redeem the cliches but do combine to dust them off a little. Meanwhile a pair of tiny mysteries have sprouted and are doing their best to confound us. Somewhere out on the interstate highways those pursuing Mogs have turned into tattooed teamsters driving a transport truck the contents of which remain invisible but not inaudible. Cue the deep growls and the deeper question What manner of rough beast lurks therein? And who is that hot blonde Caruso keeps cutting to the gal with the pre-Raphaelite tresses and the tight motorcycle leathers and the kick-ass attitude? Well if hes Number Four she must be ... oh do the math yourself. But now the climax approaches and with it the noisy destruction of any balance or moderation (did I mention that Michael Bay is the producer?). So expect that rough beast its hour come round at last to slouch toward more camera time. And expect a promise to be broken the one made early on that insists ""We are the last of our kind."" Not bloody likely. In Hotel Hollywood the rule is clear The more familiar the mattress the more procreative the behaviour upon it. Sequels will be born. Sleep will follow.

Photo For all of its homicidal aliens and toothy beasts ""I Am Number Four"" did contain one element that genuinely unsettled me the line ""produced by Michael Bay."" Nooooooo Number Four (the bland Alex Pettyfer) is a lonely superpowered teen who is one of the only survivors who made it to Earth from the late planet Ripoff. In an attempt to sucker ""Twilight"" fans the story makes Four and his father-figure mentor Henri (Timothy Olyphant) the town newbies in Paradise Ohio a burg whose 15-year-olds wish they had fangs or at least capes. Four is one of a few kids who made it to this planet from a distant solar system. Three has just been killed meaning he is now due for extermination by the evil (I cant type the word without laughing) Mogadorians a clan of aliens who are so weak and inept they should have their intergalactic supervillainy license revoked. How dumb are these ""Mogs""? To find Number Four they hire a gaggle of nerds who run a Web site modeled on ""The X-Files"" that logs evidence of alien life. When the nerds succeed and capture Henri only one Mog is around when Four shows up to rescue him even though it appears a whole day has gone by in between. What could be important enough to keep the Mogs away from their enemy? ""Buy one get one free"" night at Applebees? The nerds have no trouble finding Four because upon moving to Paradise he immediately enrolls in high school as ""John Smith"" -- nothing suspicious about that -- and in hours is showing off his superpowers. He can throw a football hard enough to knock over an athlete; his palms light up much like E.T.s finger-flashlight and he can throw things around without touching them. He allows himself to be photographed and his pictures posted online even though Number Three was tracked down and murdered while taking much more care to hide. Adapted from a young-adult book that wasnt so much written as assembled by the fabulist author James Frey and a co-writer the movie doesnt even belong in the same category as the melodramatic ""Twilight"" mediocrities. Those films come from the heart in some way. The heart of an idiot yes but they seem to matter to the storyteller. ""I Am Number Four"" throws in shape-shifting dinosaurs that come out of nowhere and disappear again when the effects budget is used up laser guns that look like theyre from the star system Hasbro an ass-kickin chick in leather and even a scene in which someone coolly saunters away from a fireball in slo-mo. The bad guys wear long black ""Matrix"" coats. The first kids Four meets in high school are a nerd a jock and a sweet artsy girl. Characters say things like ""I cant do this without you."" A cute dog comes in. At some point you begin to suspect that maybe not a lot of soul and anguish went into this script. For all its borrowing though the movie betrays an utter cluelessness about why its role models worked. Where is Fours weak spot? What is keeping him from his ladylove? Why should we care about a prop as dismal as the intergalactic lunchbox that supposedly contains magical secrets about Fours past? And why are the Mogs so easy to kill so featureless? They flail around with swords while the valiant ones turn invisible and slice them to bits. Theyre so disposable they dont even get names The highest-billed one is listed as ""Mogadorian Commander"" in the credits. But maybe Im being too harsh. Maybe once youve come up with a name as stellar as ""John Smith"" you just dont have any creative juices left.

(John Bramley) Joe Neumaier Friday February 18 2011 400 AM Title I Am Number Four With Alex Pettyfer Timothy Olyphant. A teen from another planet battles space enemies and bullies. Director D.J. Caruso (150). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.Just because a movie is about juveniles doesnt mean it has to be juvenile. ""American Graffiti"" wasnt a juvenile coming-of-age movie nor was ""The Breakfast Club"" juvenile in its depiction of high school bonding. ""Clueless"" was a deft social satire and ""Adventureland"" a rather mature teen romance.Ah but the teenage alien genre -- surely that allows for immature cliches. Except this is a time that future pop-culture-ologists will carbon-date as after ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Heroes"" departed but before ""X-Men First Class"" opened and ""Twilight"" concluded.""I Am Number Four"" with its gangly title seems like a dimwitted cousin to those hipper properties -- a Superman-come-lately tale of puppy love extraordinary powers and puberty thats duller than a chalkboard and less powerful than an extraneous Jonas brother.As ""Four"" opens a malevolent space squadron is descending to Earth to find and exterminate nine aliens all masquerading as humans and under the legal drinking age. The baddies known as Mogadorians are not a winemaking family but a vampiric-looking race that decimated the good citizens of the planet Lorien. The nine targets are genius Lorien kids who escaped to Earth and scattered. The Mogadorians have turned three of them into dust.Number Four is a teen (a dull Alex Pettyfer) who senses that his planet-mates have died because he gets glowing circular tattoos on his calf. Hitting the road with his warrior-guardian (a bored-looking Timothy Olyphant) the kid changes his name to John Smith and goes to tiny Paradise Ohio where he attends yet another school.In Paradise he meets the photography-obsessed Sarah (""Glees"" Dianna Agron) tussles with senior high bullies and befriends a geek (Callan McAuliffe). Yet Paradise seems to be the center of some weird UFO activities and you know what that means more Mogadorians. Good thing John is just learning how to use his telekinesis light-shining hands and mega-jumping ability.Adapted from a gummed-together young-adult fantasy novel by James Frey and Jobie Hughes -- writing as Pitticus Lore -- Carusos movie assumes the mere appearance of tough Aussie chick Number Six (Teresa Palmer) will make it cool.Actually the only cool part is the appearance of huge monsters the Mogadorians unleash which helps since the Mogadorians themselves look like rejects with bad makeup from ""Star Trek Deep Space Nine."" Or whichever show got transmitted to Lorien in the early 1990s. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

DreamWorks Dianna Agron and Alex Pettyfer in I Am Number Four (DreamWorks) Film Frame Alex Pettyfer in ""I Am Number Four"" (DreamWorks Pictures) Successful movie franchises have been created about teen vampires and teen werewolves and teen wizards so why not teen aliens?Well to do it right would be expensive. Its not as easy as putting rubber fangs or a pointy hat on a hunky young actor. While Ed Wood directed ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" for less than the cost of an Edsel todays teen audiences expect spaceships without visible wires attached.The cheap indifferent teen-alien thriller ""I Am Number Four"" delivers none of the spectacle of a competent sci-fi film none of the emotion of an effective teen romance and none of the giggles of a kitsch fiasco. The premise is that a dreamboat blond who calls himself John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) is actually one of the last survivors of a decimated planet. He and his cautious adult handler who calls himself Henri (Timothy Olyphant) travel from one small American town to another evading a hit squad from their home planet.We know that the sadistic bad guys are aliens because they have tiny teeth on their ferret faces and occasionally speak in their own language yet for some reason John doesnt have those handicaps. So in the idyllic burg of Paradise Ohio he is treated like any other new kid at a high school He is befriended by the science nerd (Callan McAuliffe) bullied by the star quarterback (Jake Abel) and invited into the darkroom of the quarterbacks artsy ex-girlfriend (Dianna Agron). The quarterback and the assassins launch a two-prong attack but luckily the science nerd has hard-won expertise in battling aliens and John has telekinetic powers that (inexplicably) he wasnt aware of until now. So we get bolts of blue light flying out of Johns hands and foes flung against walls. But director D.J. Caruso (""Eagle Eye"") doesnt really tap into his effects budget until the last 10 minutes of the movie when a loyal beagle finally springs into action and a late-arriving kick-butt beauty (Teresa Palmer) bids to star in a sequel.If the overlords unleash ""I Am Number Five"" beam me up Scotty.One and a half stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 150  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi action and some strong language Entertainment If you go I Am Number Four Feb 14 2011 (...)

EnlargeClose By John Bramley DreamWorks Pictures John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) practices his newfound abilities which could draw unwanted attention as he hides out in Ohio from some ruthless aliens. Audiences tucked the tykes from Kick-Ass in bed before they could put their ninja stars away. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World couldnt save its bottom line let alone the planet. And now come the brooding youngsters from I Am Number Four (  out of four) a cookie-cutter action film that hopes to stand on the shoulders of Twilight and Spider-Man but plays like Spider-lite. That may be fine for teen girls looking for some high school eye candy. In the place of Twilights Robert Pattinson is the tussled and dimpled Alex Pettyfer who plays an alien who must save the planet from uglier aliens. But its hard to get wrapped up in D.J. Carusos latest tale when the cliches include the football captain bully the nerd whos really pretty cool and town children who literally skip down the street hand in hand. Its a strange stew for Caruso who has shown hes adept at drama (The Salton Sea) and turning young actors into millionaires (Shia LaBeouf via Disturbia and Eagle Eye). About the movie I Am Number Four   out of fourStars Alex Pettyfer Timothy Olyphant Dianna Agron Teresa Palmer Director D.J. Caruso Distributor Disney Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and for brief language. Running time 1 hour 44 minutes Opens nationwide Friday. Here though the blend of computer-generated monsters and ham-handed dialogue (""Ill have that for you in a jiffy"") does no service to the source material last years popular sci-fi novel from Pittacus Lore the pen name of James Frey and Jobie Hughes. Four follows John Smith the fourth of nine aliens from the planet Lorien who are being hunted -- in consecutive order for some reason -- by the evil Mogadorians. How do we know theyre evil? They look like Harry Potters Lord Voldemort bald and in need of tartar-control toothpaste. They dress in trench coats wear scalp tattoos and favor those high Goth boots kids like so much. Our heroes are a comelier lot. The boys are ripped and the girls are stunning and ride sport bikes. Smith (Pettyfer) tries to blend into the student body of an Ohio high school to avoid being the latest outer-space casualty. Though hes misunderstood by everyone except the nerd the blond and his beagle buddy Smith thinks he may have found a home in the town of Paradise. Before long though hes whaling on bullies and advertising his existence to the Mogadorians who have descended on the town and are zapping first taunting later. There are some effective fight scenes. And Pettyfer has some nice moments too when hes discovering his power much like Peter Parker did in Spider-Man. The Mogadorians are serviceably villainous though youve seen them in any fantasy film. That ultimately is the movies shortcoming. Four is so cobbled with bits of other sci-fi and comic-book movies theres little to distinguish it. And thats not nearly enough to save a peach-fuzzed superhero. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

First your parents were killed and your planet devastated by the Mogadorians -- hideous creatures with tiny teeth and gills and the fashion sense of skinheads -- then you are sent to live on Earth with some grumpy guardian who watches over you until you can develop your secret superpowers and take care of yourself. Every time you get close to making friends or hooking up with some attractive human you have to move onto the next small town because the Mogadorians are totally tracking you. If they find you theyll kill you and take away your special symbolic necklace (the purpose of which is never made clear). Thats already been the sad fate of Numbers One through Three. I Am Number Four a movie adaptation of the best selling young adult sci-fi novel concerns the plight of Number Four (the chiseled but unexciting Alex Pettyfer) the Mogadorians next numeric target. There are gaping holes in logic throughout this sloppy cheap-looking mess from Disturbia director D.J. Caruso but at least the Mogadorians do things in an orderly fashion. The action begins as Fours guardian Henri (a glowering Timothy Olyphant) relocates him from a fun life on the Florida coast to the ironically named Paradise Ohio. As if leaving the beach wasnt a big enough drag Four now also has to go by the incredibly boring name of John Smith. You try telling the prettiest girl in your new high school your name is John Smith. ""Fine"" says a stung skeptical Sarah (Dianna Agron blissfully free of her Glee cheerleading costume) backing away from John. ""You dont want to tell me your real name."" Like John Sarah is an outsider in Paradise in that she takes arty photographs and wears a beret. He stares at her attracted and yet agonized. He only goes to school because just sitting around waiting for the Mogadorians to come kill him is even more boring than Calculus. But taskmaster Henri has made it clear he should avoid being noticed. This is hard when you walk the corridors smoldering like an Abercrombie amp; Fitch model. Sarah turns on her heel and walks away. But Cupids arrow has already struck; when a Lorien loves he or she loves forever. ""We arent like humans"" Henri says. Ouch. Way to insult your whole audience. (I must point out that when it comes to obnoxious cell phone use Loriens are as bad as human teenagers or worse. With its distinctive trills and chirps Johns iPhone is so thoroughly incorporated into the movie that I started to feel my first ever waves of dislike for my own device.) It is true that humans dont have embarrassing beams of light coming out of their palms the way John does or a newfound ability to turn cars on with their minds or burning scars that suddenly appear on their shins. This is the kind of disconcerting supernatural stuff that raises a lot of questions questions you might put to Henri if you were John. Televisions Buffy the Vampire Slayer for instance -- another super strong alienated teen in high school -- regularly demanded answers from her watcher Giles. But I Am Number Four is not big on exposition even though Marti Noxon a Buffy veteran is one of its three credited screenwriters. The attitude seems to be Well get to your silly questions in the sequel. In the meantime lets blow stuff up. Or in the most priceless lapse of logic in the movie lets have our hero and his babe pause to develop and print a roll of soul-revealing photographs while menacing aliens surround the building. Then blow things up. The special effects look about as cheesy as those on Buffy where the character development and emotional depth were so good and deep that it hardly mattered when the effects were lame. Whatever happened to building an audience beyond fans of the book? The movie version of I Am Number Four is a blatant cynical pitch for an unearned franchise made by people who seem to think the words ""bestseller"" and ""young adult"" are enough to guarantee a Harry Potter-like box office payout. Its not. Look at Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lighting Thief the first of Rick Riordans highly successful YA series which was turned into a movie that came out early last year. There are no indications yet that there will be another. The trials and tribulations of the Earth-bound Loriens -- sold incidentally as a movie treatment first and only later as a novel -- are also intended to be a series but the second book hasnt even come out yet. Titled The Power of Six its due in August and will be published under the same pen name Pittacus Lore -- and presumably will have been cowritten by the same duo Jobie Hughes and A Million Little Pieces author James Frey. Frey doesnt publicly admit to penning the first book in the series; its probably wise to let Pittacus take the rap for the movie as well.

"Movie review I Am Number Four - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-RefugeesMovie review I Am Number FourA refugee from a decimated planet lives an anonymous existence as a teen in small-town Ohio until another alien race tries to hunt down him and other refugees. Its an appealing boy-meets-girl movie with intergalactic complications.February 18 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic John (Alex Pettyfer) uses all his strength as he and Number Six (Teresa Palmer)... (DreamWorks DreamWorks )""I Am Number Four"" the appealing new kid-on-the-teen-angst block reverberates with much of the same dark combustible mix of action and romance thats been fueling the ""Twilight"" vampire mega-franchise for a while now. The issues of the heart have shifted from the undead to the otherworldly and the battles have been amped up considerably but its fate still rests on the basic boy-meets-girls story which frankly could use a bit more bite. Alex Pettyfer another lean and comely Brit with moody charisma in the Robert Pattinson vein and sugary soft Dianna Agron (""Glees"" head Cheerio) are our star-crossed high school sweethearts John and Sarah. Shes grown up in the small town of Paradise Ohio and poses the films burning question ""Who are you?"" Well my pretty hes a stranger from another planet and already at the mercy of destiny and when destiny is on your dance card love doesnt amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. For all the crazy anyone could ask for there are the deadly aliens of planet Mogadore. Pettyfers John and his guardian-warrior-pretend dad Henri (Timothy Olyphant) are refugees here. They and a handful of others are all thats left after the Mogadorians decimated planet Lorien which is just like Earth except everyone looks hot. Johns one of nine survivors all coming of age now all with super powers surfacing all with a protector like Henri all being systematically picked off by those alien bad boys. If that werent trouble enough John has to contend with the local football bullies who have targeted him and another outsider and soon-to-be ally Sam (Callan McAuliffe). When the film opens Number Three is in jeopardy somewhere in the tropics which means Johns number is up next. Henri hopes they can stay under the radar John just wants to be high school normal. But if battle they must (and they must) help is at hand. In addition to Johns smart new sidekick Sam theres a mysterious stray mutt a box from his dad that Henri wont let him open just yet and his first super power a hands that do this whole laser light thing which through director of photography Guillermo Navarros lens looks a whole lot cooler than it sounds. Amid friction at home problems at school the budding romance with Sarah the gathering Mogadorians and a whole lot more the filmmakers keep a brisk pace that will almost make you miss the movies soft spots. Alfred Gough Miles Millar and Marti Noxons smarter-than-average script doesnt veer much from its source the young adult bestseller by Pittacus Lore a nom de plume for Jobie Hughes and James Frey. (Frey you may remember got that public tongue lashing from Oprah Winfrey after his addiction autobiography ""A Million Little Pieces"" which she had championed turned out to be more fiction than fact.) With Michael ""Boom Boom"" Bay producing its not surprising that ""Number Four"" comes fully loaded with some of the best action any high school kids have gotten since Shia LaBeouf in ""Transformers."" In ""Disturbia"" director D.J. Carusos more emotionally sensitive hands the relationships start to take shape in ways that would make a future life for ""Number Four"" actually appealing. Meanwhile Navarro who brought such ethereal beauty to ""Pans Labyrinth"" and such gritty action to ""From Dusk to Dawn"" uses both of those strengths in creating a richly textured world for John to try to save. The filmmakers have a mixed bag in the ensemble surrounding Pettyfer who is by far their strongest asset. McAuliffe one of the best things to come out of the Rob Reiner flop ""Flipped"" has the looks and acting chops to suggest he might at some point become leading-man material. Olyphant is steady as Henri but feels like an untapped resource the sexy-comic irony thats made his ""Justified"" marshal on FX so much fun to watch is completely dialed down. Much of the canned heat of the repressed sexual sort so necessary to these films is provided by the leather-clad hottie Number Six played with butt-kicking verve by Teresa Palmer. Which makes the John-and-Sarah crises only worse. Its not a matter of whether theyll fall in love a that gets dispensed with right away a but absolutely no sparks fly between them. In fairness the filmmakers havent given Agron much to work with. No inner demons no teenage doubts no rebellious edge she even gets along with her parents a the basic recipe for bland and boring. That could have been the kiss of death for ""Number Four"" if not for the Mogadorians. Wearing old-style western dusters and slinging guns and monsters theyre led by the very villainous Kevin Durand an action movie staple (""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" ""Legion"") finally in charge. We dont really get much about their motivations for all the mayhem though honestly the unsightly gills on either side of their noses would put anyone in a bad mood. Evil as they are youre grateful when they show up because sparks dont just fly they ignite an inferno. John wasnt the only one waiting for the good bad fun of that. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie Review Green LanternJune 17 2011Number Fours dynamic duoFebruary 17 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTRefugeesPlanetAlex PettyferCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-i-am-number-four-20110218,0,1255594.story",200,iamnumberfour13,iamnumberfour,latimes

Beware the Mogadorians.  |  out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune February 17 2011 -- 240pm Disney Star Tribune Alex Pettyfer and Teresa Palmer in ""I Am Number Four"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Here are the Cliffs Notes on ""I Am Number Four"" ""Twilight"" with aliens. Since space creatures dont arrive with the traditional back stories of vampires and werewolves the story of extraterrestrial conflict and teenage longing requires a little setup. John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) a new transfer student to the high school in Paradise Ohio arrives with more than the usual adolescent baggage. He is one of a handful of children surviving a space war. His ancestors the people of Lorien were all but exterminated by the evil Mogadorians. The remaining nine fled to Earth where their Abercrombie amp; Fitch looks make them stand out while trying to blend in. The Mogadorians a black-trench-coat Mafia with bald heads and tribal tattoos are on their trail out to finish the genocide. They already have killed Numbers One Two and Three. Which means John is up next. The film is based on the young-adult novel of the same name which is based on Superman comics ""Terminator"" the old ""alien high"" WB TV series ""Roswell"" ""Harry Potter"" and a certain bestselling series about folks with fangs in Forks Wash. The result is a lot less mediocre than you might expect. Director D.J. Caruso (""Disturbia"") aims for flashy fun and hits the target. The tone here is lighter than the heavy-breathing angst of the ""Twilight"" films. When John and his new earthling love move in for a long goodnight kiss outside her front door her off-screen parents flick the porch lights on and off impatiently. ""I Am Number Four"" bristles with nice touches like that while nimbly handling its storytelling chores. It manages to balance the telling of the tale with fierce attacks from the dastardly Mogadorians equipped with plasma rifles and giant jaw-snapping beasts. John and his mentor/bodyguard Henri (Timothy Olyphant) defend themselves with gymnastic evasive maneuvers and glowing blades that suggest junior varsity light sabers. With the aid of a loyal mutt that proves surprisingly adaptable an earthling sidekick with plenty of experience in E.T. lore and a mysterious newcomer who looks great in tight motorcycle leathers John is well positioned to keep dodging Mogadorians for another half-dozen episodes. Ill be pleased to see ""I Am Number Four 2.""

Maybe theres a clique of vampires in the cafeteria but if there is theyre keeping to themselves.In D.J. Carusos silly adaptation of the young-adult novel by (the pen-named) Pittacus Lore an alien with telekinetic powers and the ability to project light from his hands moves to Paradise Ohio (the name is ironic judging by the look of things) where he tumbles for the varsity quarterbacks girlfriend.""We dont love like the humans"" John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) explains to Sarah (Dianna Agron from Glee). ""For us its forever.""Uh-oh commitment issues.Of course theres a band of evil aliens in pursuit of John who has been running from town to town trying to stay incognito but he somehow ends up with his picture and his special powers all over YouTube and the Internet. His interplanetary guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant) cautions him and lectures him like any self-respecting fake dad would do and then theyre off to the next town and the next pretty girl to fall for the strapping dude with the abs from another planet.As for the bad guys they wear long black coats sport Maori-style tattoos on their bald noggins have serious dental issues and carry heavy-duty hardware - and a semi truck full of raging alien beasts. These lugs are called Mogadorians and they speak a language that requires subtitles. I Am Number Four - its just like watching Godard.With clunky dialogue along the lines of ""you have no idea what I am capable of"" and ""a place is only as good as the people you know"" and ""this is the part I hate the most - the running"" I Am Number Four puts the burden on its special effects (passable) and the chemistry between Pettyfer and Agron.Alas these two are no Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart - although Stewarts glammed-up doppelganger Australian Teresa Palmer (soon to be found opposite Topher Grace in the truly dreadful Take Me Home Tonight) shows up as Number Six. Originally there had been nine altogether - extraterrestrial expats from the destroyed planet Lorien - and theyre being hunted down on Earth by those cretinous Mogadorians. But the catch is they can only be killed in sequential order. As I Am Number Four begins we see Number Three being turned to toast.Followers of the Westminster Kennel Club competition which ended this week (for the record a Scottish deerhound claimed best in show) will be heartened by the key role accorded a beagle in I Am Number Four. Named Bernie Kosar (yes after the Cleveland Browns star) this is no ordinary pooch to be sure but it takes a big fracas in Paradise Highs boys room to find out what exactly is up with this especially watchful critter.And youll have to wait until the very end when heart-crushing goodbyes are said and Number Six in motorcycle leather and supercool shades impatiently revs up her Ducati to find out how this Bernie Kosar fared in his all-important playoff against a Mogadorian monster.Here comes the sequel I Am Number Four-Legged.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + I Am Number Four is a well-made reasonably diverting night at the multiplex that will seem overly familiar to everyone except teenage girls. Itll be a retread to them too but thats why theyll like it -- a sci-fi/fantasy drama thats moody and broody to the point of occasional near-coma ""Number Four represents an acceptable holding action until the next installment of ""Twilight rolls around. The twist Instead of a misunderstood bloodsucker the adolescent hero is an alienated alien. His skin doesnt glitter but at several points his palms do glow and shoot out laser beams. So maybe the priests were right about masturbation.As played by the chiseled young Alex Pettyfer ""Number Four is an extraterrestrial princeling stranded on Earth where he and eight others have fled after their planet was invaded by the Mogadorians a sort of interstellar biker gang with piranha teeth and a fashion sense derived from obsessive viewings of ""The Matrix. Raised separately each castaway has a mentor; Number Fours is Henri (pronounced um ""Henry and played by Timothy Olyphant his temples grayed so well know hes like old) who functions as a combination father figure/bodyguard/Yoda.As the film opens Number Three and his companion are bloodily dispatched leaving our hero next on the Mogadorians sequential to-do list. Henri moves Number Four to a small Ohio town dyes his hair dubs him ""John Smith and sends him off to high school with orders to remain invisible. Which everyone knows is impossible in the age of Facebook even if you dont fall in love with a free-spirited photographer.This is Sarah (Dianna Agron the pregnant cheerleader of TVs ""Glee) whos so old-school that she shoots on film instead of digital. Theres also an elitist bully (Jake Abel) who torments the class nerd Sam (Callan McAuliffe) until John/Number Four intervenes and turns the villains wrath on himself. While everyone under 30 will look at the heros woozy hushed scenes with his new love and think "" Twilight told from Edwards POV audiences over 50 will look at the friendship of hunky bad boy misunderstood good girl and class misfit and think ""Rebel Without a Cause. (John and Sarah even meet in a fashion visually similar to James Dean and Natalie Wood in ""Rebel the glass of the principals office simultaneously dividing and revealing them.)Anyone who saw D.J. Carusos ""Disturbia knows the director knows his oldies (to the point of infringement according to the copyright holders of ""Rear Window) but here he skates across the sur face of the storys implausibilities and holds off the action sequences until the final half-hour. ""I Am Number Four is a Michael Bay production but youd never know it until the Mogadorians arrive at the end with two rampaging ""pets they keep in a tractor trailer and a leader (Kevin Durand) with a hilarious superiority complex toward Earths hapless ape-men.At this point the movie comes alive -- at last -- in a satisfying eruption of mindless but expertly choreographed PG-13 violence. A high school is destroyed the true nature of the heros pet beagle is revealed and we at last learn the identity of the Tuff Babe (Teresa Palmer) who has been tracking Number Four since the beginning. Unless youve seen the promotional ads since they stupidly give away the movies best surprise.Mostly ""I Am Number Four is a pokey pretty predictable romance in which the boy is a shy extraterrestrial with secret powers and a royal lineage -- your classic study-hall daydream -- and the girl is a gentle alt-goddess. Pettyfer has the looks and just enough charisma to hold the camera and Agron has a sleepy-eyed way of delivering her dialogue one beat behind that makes you pay attention. For all that the films only poignant scene comes when Sarah brings her new beau home to a family dinner and John gets a rare glimpse of what its like to be unalienated.""I Am Number Four is based on a best-selling book supposedly written by an alien named Pittacus Lore; we should be so lucky since the authors behind the pseudonym are actually Jobie Hughes and the disgraced autobiographer/Oprah Winfrey punching bag James Frey. A follow-up novel is due this year but dont hold your breath waiting for a movie sequel. Nor should we expect a prequel since it would doubtless have to be called ""I Am Number Two.

The villainous E.T.s are hunting the children in numerical order (the reason  made clear in the book is never given in the adaptation) and John is next on their list.Upon the death of Number Three John and his guardian (Timothy Olyphant) ditch their cover identities in the Florida Keys and relocate to the small town of Paradise Ohio where John enrolls in a high school straight out of an 80s movie complete with bullying jocks a misunderstood geek (Callan McAuliffe) and a sweet equally misunderstood cheerleader (Glees Dianna Agron).John tries to stay of f the local radar but romantic entanglements and the sudden manifestation of his special abilities (a clunky metaphor for puberty) make that difficult. It isnt long before things start going kerblooey which is of course par for the course with anything involving producer Michael Bay. (Even Bays TV commercials feature more pyrotechnics than a 70s-era KISS concert.)Fortunately director D.J. Caruso has honed his drama and suspense skills to some degree with the likes of Disturbia Eagle Eye and The Salton Sea; hes able to add a little depth to an otherwise shallow story. Still hes hamstrung by stiff by-the-book acting from the younger leads stale dialogue and too much reliance on special effects. Olyphant and an e njoyably over-the-top Kevin Durand are the lone standouts.The climax is classic Bay with extended explosions shootouts and superpowered battles royal. Throw in a couple of slobbering beasts and the timely yet poorly explained arrival of one of Johns fellow aliens and it all slides into incoherence.Ultimately its a missed opportunity to explore teen angst and identity confusion through the fantasy elements that appeal so much to that audience. The result is a mishmash of genres that feels bland and impersonal.PG-13 (intense sequences of violence and action and for language). Starring Alex Pettyfer Timothy Olyphant Dianna Agron Teresa Palmer Callan McAuliffe and Kevin Durand. Directed by D.J. Caruso. 104 mins.

Share Tweet The story behind I Am Number Four is far more interesting than its actual storyline. It was the first property sold by Full Fathom Five the ""fiction factory"" of disgraced A Million Little Pieces author James Frey; as chronicled in a scathing New York article Frey offers young writers a few hundred dollars plus a profit share to ghost-write market-minded books he can shop around as multimedia properties. The film rights to I Am Number Four sold before the book did and Frey has used that success to entice dozens more writers into his sweatshop. In interviews Frey has openly admitted his desire to create the next Harry Potter series by monkeying slightly with proven formulas; he also acknowledges adding distinctive weapons and jewelry into I Am Number Four entirely to produce marketable spin-off items. The films plot feels just as nakedly calculated for profit It concerns an alien teenager (Alex Pettyfer) with developing superpowers running from a race of alien warriors who want him dead for some cursorily explained hes-a-Chosen-One reason. The important part is that hes hunted which gives him plenty of chances for flashy special-effects combat teen angst over his life on the run and pathos when he falls for an appropriately soulful Earth girl. There are no vampires in I Am Number Four but the emotional palette is ripped from Twilight (mope yearn glower) and the character dynamics from The Lost Boys As the new kid in town Pettyfer falls for Glees Dianna Agron; deals with her alpha-male ex and his coterie who either want to embrace Pettyfer or beat him down; and gets some help from a cringing-but-knowledgeable little-brother figure. D.J. Caruso (Disturbia Eagle Eye) directs all this with a solid eye for thrilling battle scenes but with little interest in escaping the cheesy overemotiveness of the script written by Smallville co-creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar and frequent Joss Whedon collaborator Marti Noxon. If anything Caruso embraces the eye-rolling excess with characters walking away from explosions in slo-mo and a pack of hissing grinning baddies who seem to be channeling the Kurgan from Highlander. Really everything in I Am Number Four is recognizable from many past films. Frey didnt really need a ghostwriter for this story he just needed an archivist with a Xerox machine and a mercenary streak.

Comments (1) click to enlarge I Am Number Four Video Rated PG-13  104 minutes  2011 This sci-fi thriller may be adapted from a young adult novel but it feels like a big-screen version of Smallville the TV series created by screenwriters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. An orphaned teen (Alex Pettyfer) and his guardian (Timothy Olyphant) both refugees from another planet flee when the brutal invaders from their world arrive on earth looking for them; the teen decides to quit running after he meets a pretty student (Diana Agron) in a small Ohio town and he sublimates his emerging sex drive by mastering his nascent super powers. Producers Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg deploy an arsenal of noisy special effects to demonstrate the invaders high-tech superiority which makes Olyphants inability to breach an Internet firewall look pretty silly.

"Transformers plus Twilight equals Four - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Transformers plus Twilight equals FourI Am Number Four a 2 starsFebruary 17 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic""I Am Number Four"" has more than a whiff of number two about it but this bombastic combination of ""Twilight"" romance and ""Transformers"" destruction and decibel levels may very well connect with its target PG-13 audience. Its a little of everything. And its sold by weight and volume.Like the young-adult book whence it came it hammers together a lonely-teen fantasy involving interplanetary monsters sociopathic small-town bullies and a variety of circumstances preventing the fated sweethearts -- one human one with beams of light coming out of his hands -- from getting too familiar. Just when even the most rabid ""Twilight"" fanatics were starting to think ""Are these two ever gonna do it?"" along comes ""I Am Number Four"" the first screen adaptation of a series of books known as ""The Lorien Legacies"" to keep the supercharged celibacy going.Director D.J. Carusos film takes place in a burg halfway in spirit between Supermans Smallville and the good vampires of Forks Wash. On the run from vicious Mogadorians who wiped out their beloved planet of Lorien two surviving Loriens have taken the form of a teenage boy and his ""father"" the new guys in town. Alex Pettyfer plays the student John Smith. Timothy Olyphant is his guardian and protector Henri. If ""The Courtship of Eddies Father"" had tons and tons of computer-generated effects it would be ""I Am Number Four.""The object for the humanoid aliens is to stay alive keep moving and never mix too closely with the earthlings who -- silly things -- dont realize a takeover of their planet is Job One for the Mogadorians. In a nasty prologue set somewhere in the African jungle two other Loriens are killed by flying slashing enemy monsters. When the Mogadorians die they dont bleed; instead they die the PG-13-friendly death of turning instantly into gray ash and scattering to the four winds.I found the mythology of ""I Am Number Four"" vague and sloppy. The book was co-written by disgraced ""A Million Little Pieces"" memoirist James Frey and the much younger Jobie Hughes working together under the pseudonym Pittacus Lore. The screenwriters have endless fodder with which to work. But the spirit of the movie is heavy and calculating in the ""Transformers"" vein. Only ""Glees"" Dianna Agron as the shutterbug sweetheart of Pettyfers hunkanoid alien brings a touch of class to the proceedings which are likely to proceed directly to the first sequel.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action and for brief language)Cast Alex Pettyfer (John Smith); Timothy Olyphant (Henri); Teresa Palmer (Number 6); Dianna Agron (Sarah); Callan McAuliffe (Sam); Kevin Durand (Mogadorian Commander)Credits Directed by D.J.

D.J. Carusos generic adventure co-written by Frey under a pseudonym concerns John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) a hunky blond teen who is actually an alien living life on the run--along with protector Henri (a wasted Timothy Olyphant)--from sharp-teethed gill-nosed assassins intent on destroying him and his eight extraterrestrial brethren. In forested Paradise Ohio lonely John combats jock bullies befriends a UFO-obsessed nerd (Callan McAuliffe) and finds everlasting love with Sarah (Glees Dianna Agron)--a beautiful outsider whos the angsty Bella to his brooding Edward--all while discovering how to harness the ill-defined powers that emanate from his glowstick hands. The film is constructed with the blatant intent of wooing multiple demographics comic-book moping and murky CGI-addled combat for him; star-crossed romance (and a sequel-ready love triangle) for her; and a cute puppy for animal lovers too. Schematically amalgamating pop-culture tropes I Am Number Four is a transparent mass-market product that with its incessant close-ups of the iPhone also doubles as an advertisement for others.

I Am Number Four Good Director D.J. Caruso. Cast Alex Pettyfer Dianna Agron Timothy Olyphant. Rating PG-13 for violence action and language. Guide to this weeks new releases >> Guide to this weeks new releases The film focuses on a blandly hunky teenager aptly named John Smith (Alex Pettyfer). In reality John is among a group of aliens from the planet Lorien who were sent to Earth as infants to avoid the Mogadorians a menacing species that destroyed Johns home planet and now are hunting down the refugees. John moves into small Paradise Ohio with his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant). John tries to fit in at high school tough to do when you are discovering you have superhuman strength and your hands glow like flashlights whenever you get anxious. In movies like ""Disturbia"" and ""Eagle Eye"" director D.J. Caruso displayed a knack for taking lightweight material and polishing it up with a frantic paranoid sheen. He does the same here. The characters may be thin and some situations obvious but the movie zips along at a breathless pace juiced by exciting action sequences and some spectacular visual effects. Especially intriguing are the evil Mogadorians. Played by actors made up with bald pates head tattoos and fishlike gills on their faces they travel the country pursuing John. They are genuinely creepy yet also good for a laugh A scene in which the aliens visit a grocery store to stock up on frozen turkeys is delightfully absurd. There are other nice touches throughout. John has an adorable pet dog that figures in a neat plot twist and a budding romance between John and a classmate (Dianna Agron from TVs ""Glee"") is sweetly underplayed. By the time the film reaches its exciting over-the-top finale you may find yourself involved in the fates of the characters. Well as involved as you can get in a movie that uses the word ""Mogadorian"" on a regular basis. The film is an adaptation of a young-adult novel written by Jobie Hughes and James Frey (""A Million Little Pieces"") and published under the pen name Pittacus Lore. At times it harks back to the kind of science-fiction movies that Disney used to make; think ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" with older better-looking kids in the lead roles. Its no surprise that the DreamWorks film is released through the Disney company. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

""I Am Number Four"" is a flashy lunkheaded sci-fi extravaganza sure to appeal to teenagers who like their interplanetary warfare bloodless their high-school soaps squeaky-clean and their numbers countable on one hand. Blandly but passably adapted from Pittacus Lores popular 2010 novel this Earth-set saga about a race of benign alien refugees fleeing from genocidal pursuers has been outfitted with the fresh young faces and furious f/x one would expect from producer Michael Bay. As such healthy if not out-of-this-world biz seems likely for a franchise launcher that wont dislodge ""Roswell"" or ""Smallville"" from the small-town space-invader annals. Those TV series arent the only forebears discernible in ""I Am Number Fours"" highly derivative DNA. Drawn from the first installment of a proposed six-book cycle by Lore (the pen name of James Frey and Jobie Hughes) the pic also contains traces of ""X-Men"" ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" and ""The X-Files."" The latter is actually referenced at one point by a side character Sam whose long-lost dad seems to have been beamed up to the mothership. That thread will no doubt be picked up in the sequel. Pic opens with a tense jungle-set prologue that climaxes with the ambush and murder of a young man -- the third in a sequentially linked chain of nine survivors from the destroyed planet Lorien. Now theyre being hunted down one by one by the Mogadorians an evil heavily tattooed race of leather fetishists who look more hellbent on getting into a death-metal concert than achieving universal domination. As decreed by ancient charms of yore the Mogadorians can kill the Loric survivors in numerical order only and Number Four a Florida-based beach bum who goes by John Smith (British thesp Alex Pettyfer) knows theyll be gunning for him next. By now accustomed to living like nomads John and his guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant) head for the rural burg of Paradise Ohio where Henri sternly warns the young teen to lie low and blend in at the local high school. But John can no more blend in than Ferris Bueller and on his first day he manages to run afoul of resident bully Mark (Jake Abel); befriend the scrawny UFO-obsessed Sam (Callan McAuliffe); and make googly-eyes at the very hot Sarah (Dianna Agron) whose passion for photography marks her as a sensitive (but still very hot) alterna-chick type. Pics target audience will recognize Agron as head cheerleader Quinn Fabray from ""Glee"" and its telling that her material here doesnt rep much of a stretch; ""I Am Number Four"" is a movie that posits the existence of amazing extraterrestrial life and plays out with all the gravity of a ""Dawsons Creek"" episode. That blend of intergalactic stakes and everyday tweener angst might have worked if the screenplay had fleshed out Johns warring impulses his desire to lead a normal adolescence but also his excitement over his rapidly developing alien powers as he goes through the Loric equivalent of puberty. But Pettyfer a former model being groomed for Stateside stardom (he stars in next months ""Beastly"") never registers as more than dully likable here and theres no visceral or hormonal kick to the scenes in which he tests out his superhuman abilities. Shots of John learning to leap off cliffs and wring guys necks from afar should leave us pumped and exhilarated rather than miffed that such gifts were bequeathed to some kid with a crummy dye job. Indeed the pics stumbling block is its inability to convince us were watching someone extraordinary -- admittedly a difficult thing to pull off in a movie marketplace crowded with teenage aliens/wizards/vampires/superheroes who supposedly walk among us undetected. Its possible that future franchise installments will flesh out the mythology of Lorien and explain for one why its inhabitants so closely resemble the moody youth of planet Earth but the script perhaps wisely economizing provides little context beyond Johns banal opening and closing voiceovers. Impersonally helmed by D.J. Caruso (""Eagle Eye"" ""Disturbia"") pic does afford its share of diversions. Olyphant brings some of his usual edge to the role of Johns tough-loving mentor. Theres a really cute beagle who comes to Johns rescue more than once and is clearly the brains of the whole operation. And for better or worse ""I Am Number Four"" becomes a real Bay movie in its climactic blowout replete with mammoth CGI monsters football-field-sized explosions and a smokin display of marksmanship by arresting Aussie actress Teresa Palmer. She plays Number Six and she stomps through the movie with the furious impatience of someone convinced that better things lie ahead. Lets hope shes right.

Sign up for our Newsletters. Daily Edition Login to download I Am Number Four Review 632 AM PST 2/16/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A high-school movie with a sci-fi twist ultimately fumbles away a golden opportunity to give youth conflicts an added dimension. TWITTER D.J. Carusoas action thriller features a one-dimensional lead in Alex Pettyfer but co-stars Dianna Agron and Teresa Palmer are more eye-catching in the drama department. I Am Number Four follows the Twilight series playbook in casting a high school outsider as an otherworldly character. In this case hes an alien from outer space who changes schools the way normal kids change T-shirts because other aliens are out to destroy him. The movie is a mixed bag with many of the elements fun and intriguing but since this is also a Michael Bay-produced movie CG monsters and cartoon bad guys gum up a third act that cries out for a more sophisticated climax rather than another tedious battle royal taking place mostly in the digital realm. Young English actor Alex Pettyfer the hunk of the moment for teen girls stars as the misunderstood alien (chalk one up for savvy casting). Pettyfer has two more youth-targeted movies on tap this year Beastly and Now but in this performance he fails to justify the female shrieks he elicits. Yes his body is well chiseled but his acting -- moodiness relieved only by flashes of anger -- leaves a hole in the movie. The rest of the cast is more eye-catching in the drama department especially Glees Dianna Agron as a teen absorbed in photography Callan McAuliffe as a geeky guy into UFO lore and fellow Australian Teresa Palmer who adds plenty of sex appeal and athleticism to the role of another much more self-confident alien. A brief action sequence that opens the movie establishes the fact that a handful of good aliens from the doomed planet of Lorien are being hunted on Earth by villainous ones called Mogadorians. These baddies are eliminating nine good Loriens in numerical order; Number Three meets his fate in the opening thus letting the target fall to Number Four (Pettyfer). The film gives no clue as to who or what established this pecking order. Number Four and his protector (Timothy Olyphant) masquerading as his father flee their identities in the Florida Keys for brand-new ones in the small town of Paradise Ohio. (The movie was actually filmed in and around Pittsburgh.) As ""John Smith"" Number Four enters a high school that even one character is forced to admit consists of cliches run amok A male clique surrounding the schools star quarterback (Jake Abel) bullies a geek who believes in UFOs; and a beautiful cheerleader only wants to escape the gravitational pull of these thick-headed jocks. Number Four is ordered to keep a low profile by his protector which is hard to do when your hands glow like lightbulbs and you can toss around football players and police cars like matchsticks. So Number Four has a very hard time staying off YouTube which is why the Mogadorians lead by a hammy Kevin Durand are hot on his trail. Number Four falls for Sarah (Agron) former girlfriend to the star quarterback which creates all sorts of conflicts. He also befriends the geek (McAuliffe) with an interest in ""ancient astronauts"" and often comes between him and his bullies. So the stage is well set in Alfred Gough Miles Millar and Marti Noxons screenplay (based on the novel by Pittacus Lore) for a high school story with a twist. But Bay and his handpicked director D.J. Caruso fall back on their own geekdom by turning the movie over to CGI and VFX mavens rather than taking advantage of a considerable investment in character and story. Shape-shifting X-ray gun battles and telekinetic high jinks turn the school into rubble which violates the spirit of this close encounter grounded in a kind of reality. The villains and their monster kept in a trailer they lug around the country while feeding it frozen turkeys are poorly designed coming off as something out of the lame comic books the head villain has the temerity to mock. Even the ending as it relates to the teenagers in love feels weird. Perhaps the filmmakers are setting up a sequel but this films final note is most unsatisfying. I Am Number Four is mostly a missed opportunity. The film plugs into some genuine teen angst and identity confusion that might have dovetailed nicely with its sci-fi elements. Instead these two realities a high school with its many melodramas and aliens chasing each other around the country operate on parallel tracks. At times it feels like the reels from two very different movies got mixed up in the projection booth. The idea here is nifty; the execution mostly pedestrian.

"Movie Review ""I Am Number Four"" | Movie Nation Movie Nation Filmgoing movie loving and a good argument. On a good day. Skip to content - Movie Review ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" Movie Review ""Gnomeo amp; Juliet"" - Movie Review ""I Am Number Four"" Posted on January 29 2013      by rogerinorlando Theyre young theyre darned attractive and their hands glow an eerie neon blue when theyre in trouble. And theyre in trouble a lot because theyre being hunted. They have superhuman strength great hair and lips and wardrobes to die for. And in ""I Am Number Four"" theyre not vampires. Thank heavens. Brit hunk Alex Pettyfer took an earlier shot at a franchise (""Alex Rider Stormbreaker"" didnt work out) but hes grown into a solid and quite interesting lead to build this potential sci-fi movie series around. He plays John who is named Daniel when we first meet him. Hes one of the nine ""gifted"" children rescued from their planet which was overrun by the same beastly boys who are hunting him to this day. The nine were hidden away on Earth with protectors. Daniels is named Henry (Timothy Olyphant quite good). When their cover is blown in sunny surfside Florida they hit flee. ""This is the part of my life I hate the most"" Daniel narrates. ""The running."" They slip into Paradise Ohio where Daniel becomes ""John Smith."" Despite Henrys protests John refuses to lay low. He goes to high school. He falls for the hot photographer Sarah (Diana Agron of TVs ""Glee""). He runs afoul of her bully-jock ex-boyfriend (Jake Abel). And John finds a kindred spirit the kid everybody teasingly calls ""Spock"" but whose real name is Sam (Callan McAuliffe of ""Flipped""). Sam thinks his dad was abducted by aliens so he and John have a lot to talk about. ""My entire childhood was an episode of The X-Files."" Director D.J. Caruso (""Disturbia"") knows his action beats and he stages some fierce fights in the third act. There are ray guns alien torture balls and reptilian tracking dogs beasties that the Mogadorian assassination squad has at its disposal. The Lorian kids are armed with neon-tipped daggers.  Caruso gives the Jobie Hughes/James Frey source novel as many flashy whistles and bells as he can in bringing this tale to the screen. But what works best are the high school moments -- kids enforcing or trying to escape the social order ""puppy love"" rearing its head. Olyphant gives his father figure a wild-eyed edge. And I loved the way Teresa Palmer is br0ught in as a super-cool super-deadly Aussie blonde who is on Johns trail too. As action films aimed at this audience go ""Number 4 falls midway between ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians"" and ""Twilight"" -- edgier than ""Jackson""  mockingly self-aware but without the white-hot sexual tension of the vampire movies.  And the subtext that you shouldnt waste your teen years on stupid risks because youre needed ""for a higher purpose"" makes this a franchise I wont mind seeing progress to a second movie. See for Yourself ""I Am Number Four"" Cast Alex Pettyfer Diana Agron Timothy Olyphant Teresa Palmer Callan McAuliffe Director D.J. Caruso Running time  1 hour 48 minutes Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and for language. Share thisTwitterFacebookLike thisLike Loading...
