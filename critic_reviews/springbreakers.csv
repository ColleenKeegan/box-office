Next Out of Africa Millennium Films Facebook Twitter Print Movies Olympus Games Plus a Tina Fey fizzle and the pervy ugly Spring Breakers by Wesley Morris on March 22 2013 Sometimes no matter how many right notes an action movie hits -- no matter how thoroughly say the White House is sacked; how comically the secretary of Defense is dragged down a hall while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance; or how satisfying it is to watch one ex-soldier and former Secret Service agent take down dozens of North Korean lunatics to save the president of the United States -- it can still feel like the filmmakers just tore open a pouch labeled ""blockbuster"" poured its powder into a bowl and opened the microwave. Olympus Has Fallen is made from action-movie mix. Just add sweat. The music (horns strings swiftly beaten drums) is too much like what you hear in video-game home screens and military recruitment ads. The story in which North Korean terrorists hold hostage the president (Aaron Eckhart) and some of his Cabinet is political the way army fatigues on Rihanna are political. And the star (Gerard Butler) feels like the producers third or fourth backup even though one of the producers is the star himself. Despite the professionalism put into downing American helicopters arranging corpses on the White House lawn and making sure every Beltway-disaster-movie cliche is checked off all Olympus Has Fallen has going for it is that generic professionalism. Butler plays Mike a detective who used to guard the First Family until a terrible accident forced his pal the president to demote him. Mike sees his old buddies and gets wistful for his old job. When the North Koreans hatch their absurdly effective hostage plot Mike gets armed to the teeth and prowls through the Oval Office and Lincoln Bedroom with the amusing seriousness of a Mattel toy starring in Platoon. The store-brand quality that courses through this movie also has to do with Butlers being surrounded by Eckhart Melissa Leo Angela Bassett Ashley Judd Radha Mitchell and Morgan Freeman without really ever giving them an occasion to rise to. Well after about 85 minutes of sitting tied up next to Eckhart it is Leo who gets to defiantly recite that Pledge of Allegiance. But its hard to watch anything that so badly misuses its four leading women. Mitchell spends most of her time nursing it up at a nearby hospital in crisis mode. Like First Lady Judd shes here (however expendably) to remind us that when Mike and POTUS lock eyes and eventually arms its just two dudes being in love ... with like um standing up to terrorism and saving America. But we also need the movie to throw us better more original curveballs than casting a hot guy (Rick Yune) as the terrorist mastermind or finding new ways to cross off Beltway-disaster-movie cliche no. 1 making Freeman commander-in-chief. Yes because Eckhart and the vice-president are holed up Speaker of the House Freeman takes over and reminds you that as ferocious and intense an actor as Eckhart is nothing about him says ""presidential."" Antoine Fuqua ( Training Day Shooter) directs with the dutiful anonymity of whoever made Iron Eagle II or Delta Force 3. Without the showmans insanity of a Michael Bay the flagrance of a Jerry Bruckheimer the boundless cash of a Joel Silver or the hawkish ideology of a Tom Clancy adaptation youre left with an accidental parody of what happens when crazies attack. You want gusto. You want evil. You want charisma. You get a lot of cardboard heroism and self-defensive machismo. Butler is more than serviceable even though his American accent is like water in a dirty glass. (All you can taste is the residue of whatever was in it before.) In one flavorless film after the next he has always seemed like a cut-rate Russell Crowe or discount Mel Gibson -- the fire in him is Duraflame. But this movie is a shrewd choice. I could hear the audience falling in love with him the night I saw it. With the old icons virtually obsolete we might be ready for a newer loosely younger indestructible paragon of pseudo-military awesomeness. This is why were coming back around to Dwayne Johnson whos more convincing at this kind of bravado. But in a pinch Butlers forced charisma will do. Tina Feys starred in only four movies in the past 10 years -- Mean Girls Baby Mama and Date Night were the first; the fourth an aggravating romantic comedy called Admission opens this weekend. And in each you leave convinced that theres a more damaged side of herself than even what shes shown as Liz Lemon. On television the emotional complexity you suspect her of having was insulated by farce. At the movies there are too many opportunities for the camera and editing to catch her surprised by her vulnerability. When Alec Baldwin put her down on 30 Rock Fey was able to bob on the currents of his loving bile. In the rare moments when Admission is at its best the bile leaves a burn. She plays Portia Nathan a drably scrupulous Princeton admissions officer who gets a call to visit an experimental school in New Hampshire run by an old Dartmouth classmate of hers named John (Paul Rudd). When the kids give her grief about the oppressive corporate bogusness of the Ivy League system she snaps back at them. But when her uptight long-term condescending British professor boyfriend (Michael Sheen) leaves her for an undermining colleague she slumps. The movie isnt about the breakup. And even though I actually dont know what Admission is about theres ache enough in Fey to wish shed find material that allows her to explore it. Karen Croner adapted the film from a 2009 novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz. You can feel the script and director Paul Weitz trying to smooth a lot of activity into a single movie. But larded with a lot of physical comedy (cue Portia delivering a baby calf) it never ever coheres. At work Portia is vying to become the new dean of admission. She winds up in and out of the home of her estranged mom (Lily Tomlin) an ice queen earth mother and best-selling emasculator. John keeps pushing one of his students on her an oddball and screwup named Jeremiah (Nat Wolff) and after the first time its uncomfortable. Meanwhile the movie keeps pushing her in front of John. Each of these developments proceeds in a tone that has nothing to do with the other. Very few of the actors bring anything out of anyone else. And sexually Fey and Rudd have nothing to offer. When their bodies touch it feels scholarly like watching a pencil trying to kiss a pen. At the heart of the problem with this movie are matters of logic and cogency. As Jeremiah becomes a Princeton applicant John tells Portia that the kid whos been adopted by a couple is the son she gave up years ago at Dartmouth. How a woman as procedure-oriented as Portia would allow herself to get mixed up in a potential scandal doesnt wash. Neither does the ""you didnt love me enough"" melodrama with her mother. The character shuttlecocks from one implausible scenario to the next. In order for her sense of maternity to resonantly corrupt her professional integrity we have to believe in the kid and as delightfully unusual as Wolff is as a screen presence we dont see enough of Jeremiah to care when she sticks her neck out for him. But Fey makes a case that the real romance here is entirely parental. If were aligned with Portia at all its because the woman playing her is too. In movies Fey hasnt come close to reaching her flashpoint. The pratfalls and humiliations are getting in the way of what she could do with the maternal angst that she clearly drawn to. Between her old TV show and her movies I think shes been playing that mommy angst so long that its no longer funny to her. Its real. Right now her comedy blunts the sharpness of whatevers fostering that angst. If she dared to let the anesthesia wear off what she might do with the pain could be seismic. Its always fair to hope that Harmony Korines movies -- Gummo Julien Donkey-Boy Mister Lonely Trash Humpers the new Spring Breakers which is spreading around the country like an STD -- are on to something. You want to believe that theres some perception behind his grimy druggy vision for the movies that his carnivalesque attraction to freaks and creeps and the shocking stuff he has them do makes him a kind of Diane Arbus that he can sense truth in ugliness. Korine seems to be absorbing the same culture as the rest of us -- watching the same television listening to the same music getting the same greasy fingers we all do from gossip glossies. But Korines movies are like a toxic reaction to it all like he keeps missing the warning that says ""Packed in a facility that also handles nuts."" With his celebrity-impersonator romance Mister Lonely the toxicity achieved sweetness. The low-definition pranksterism of Trash Humpers was like watching homemade horror. For about a 20-minute stretch the definition in Spring Breakers is exhilaratingly high. Korine has swapped out the fuzz and grain and blur of his other movies for lasered digital crispness and microsecond montages. These are the minutes after which three college girls (Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Korines wife Rachel) have held up a diner to realize the spring break dreams of another friend -- a dull Christian played by Selena Gomez. They arrive in St. Petersburg Florida fully bikinied hungry for fun and open to exploitation. But theyre not what brings Korine to the beaches and cheap motels. Its the opportunity to marry jiggling flesh and hypnotically fruity color to the squealing bleating pump of the music of Skrillex. What Korine does with the beer-soaked skin face-devouring makeouts and piles and piles of barely dressed people is intensify the college-party atmosphere in a way that feels simultaneously orgasmic and repulsive. The moral squalor is so thick you can practically smell the police investigation. But in going for stylized personification Korine loses the social principle. Diane Arbus warps into Nan Goldin. The degradation the girls face at the hands of horny young men is supposed to be tolerable because a couple of the girls seem to invite and instigate it (and perhaps because one of the girls is married to the director). You dont sense that Korine has gone into any scene with an agenda for what he hopes to achieve a scene later. When the college foursome winds up in the care and the bed of a rapping drug-dealing cornrowed sleaze played by James Franco the movie seems to flee from what ideas it has in a hurry like a plastic bottle speeding down a river. Everything Franco does here calls attention to itself if for no other reason than hes the only person in front of the camera with any discernible skill. Hudgens and Gomez appear to be here for the credibility-boosting stunt work. But Gomez seems afraid for her life and Hudgens whos really going for it cant yet act to save hers. As a team the quartet weaves into and out of embarrassment. When the girls gang up on Franco and force him to give head to a gun Spring Breakers scrambles the obviousness of the metaphor and turns strangely erotic. Still as committed as Franco is to doing everything Korine asks of him he instantly removes all the danger menace and atmosphere from the movie. His fame purifies the air. The risk is all on the women and Korine appears to have no capacity to redeem them. All the better to shock you I guess. But the movie is too calculated to shock. Korine just wants to be the danger hes warning us about.

Korines last full-length film was the scuzzy experimental Trash Humpers and he often keeps things unpolished in look and spiky in tone. But this absurd brightly glowing tale of three girls (Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine) who rob a restaurant to fund a booze-and-sex holiday in Florida with a fourth friend (Selena Gomez) is surprisingly good-looking dreamy and soft-centred. Which is odd because on the surface Korines story overflows with nastiness guns drugs dirty cash and endless sins of the flesh. Once our bikinid quartet arrive in Florida their hard-partying lands them in jail  until theyre bailed out by Alien (James Franco) a gangster in a sports car whos all cornrows gold teeth and loud shirts. At first it seems like Alien is a joke but it soon turns out hes a gangster for real - although he still comes across as a complete clown. Its a bizarre and upending performance; Franco gives it all hes got and is forever spinning guns and fondling cash (when hes not playing Britney Spears on a white poolside piano). What threatens to be a down n dirty tits n ass fest in the style of Larry Clark or even a kids-in-peril thriller actually turns into a warped fairytale of the American teen dream of hedonism and crime one that takes itself just seriously enough not to be dismissed as trashy exploitation. It flirts with the mainstream - from which it borrows its style music and actresses - but the films true intent is never fully clear. Its campy and comic at times but Korine also gives the film a downbeat melancholic edge with voiceovers pointed repetition of dialogue and images and hallucinatory camera work sound and editing. All this helps to prevent Spring Breakers from becoming a full-on flesh fest and tips it more towards the surreal. Theres no judgment here nor is Korine simply celebrating the good-bad life into which Alien leads these teens. Hes mostly determined just to show us a good time and he does that in full-on bass-thumping flesh-panning style even if his lack of commitment to character and clear ideas is frustrating at times.

If youre not a white teenage boy then dont bother watching this movie This movies supposed to be about 4 teenage girls and a ""hardcore"" drug dealer/rapper going on a crime spree but this movies about as gangster as... well about as gangster as Franco Hudgens and Selena Gomez The funniest part is when the hardcore drug dealer is playing piano and singing a slow ass Britney Spears song smh The most unbelievable part is when 4 young girls spend the day in jail and even appear b4 the judge in skimpy bikinis Seriously like the county jail/magistrate doesnt own orange jumpsuits?

From James Francos urban gangster stereotype that was easily bordering on tedious; to the surprisingly career changing turns by the girls including Hudgens and Gomez. The soundtrack by Cliff Martinez amp; Skrillex carried the movie; from the opening madness of the summer beach party to the ambient pathos of the girls predicament in trying to release themselves from the radicalisation of their Alien (James Franco) influenced lifestyle.

It kills the family images that Hudgens and Gomez had to nasty downright awful people who would go for this tedious movie that would be a great advert for teen smoking.

I fall into the latter category. It just strikes me as an exploitative and deeply nasty film where the girls are always in bikinis or naked and in either situation possessions to be used . Im not sure if the intention was for Gomez to leave part way through but it is a decision that may save her career and the Disney future. For Hudgens it may be too late after the disaster that was Sucker Punch this is a second disaster in a row.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 29 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 29 2013 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Harmony Korine Written by Harmony Korine Starring Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens Rachel Korine and James Franco Classification 18A Genre thriller Year 2012 Country USA Language English Neon bright and all raw energy Spring Breakers is a pulsating paradox of a movie both a tangerine dream and a cultural reality check a pop artifact that simultaneously exploits and explores the shallowness of pop artifacts. It wants to be deeply superficial profoundly silly and flings us around in the eddies of that oxymoron like a shipwrecked sailor on a roiling sea. There tossed about and trying to decide if this is meaningful or meaningless were nothing if not engaged and that engagement may by the ultimate mark of the pictures success. Whether the film is uniquely brilliant or dismissively dumb is not the issue here. Either choice can (and will) be offered - its the choosing that counts. Multimedia Spring Breakers The official trailer Quick to make good on the title the first shot is an electronically scored montage of the beach movies signature troika - bikinis breasts booze - displayed in bacchanalian splendour on the Florida sands. Courtesy of writer/director Harmony Korine the aging enfant terrible whose imagination usually runs to the darker and dingier corners of youth cult (Gummo the script for Kids) such a DayGlo opener seems a big change a headlong march right into the mainstream. Once again it is and it isnt. Because the montage is shot by Benoit Debie the favourite cinematographer of that other enfant terrible Gaspar Noe (Irreversible Enter the Void) the sequence possesses an eerily hallucinatory quality at odds with the genres fun-in-the-sun norm. Yes its the same and its different.Cut northward to a quartet of co-eds on a near-deserted campus. True to her name Faith is a practising Christian; true to their party animal nature the other three look-alike blondes are of the pagan persuasion. Despite that theyre all fast friends - female bonding has never been tighter - with a shared need to leave a place where ""Everything is the same and everything is just sad."" Confirmation of that assessment comes with a haunting shot of a darkened classroom where grey laptops line the desks like glowing tombstones.So Florida beckons but money is short at least until the blondes steal a car and armed with a toy gun rob a Chicken Delight eatery. We see the hold-up only as the getaway driver does from the outside constantly circling a detached perspective that neatly echoes the girls defiant vow of detachment ""Just pretend its a fucking video game.""Which brings us to the players. Along with his wife Rachel Korine has cast Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson in the lead quartet all three hitherto best known for their work in squeaky clean projects. Here dropping F-bombs and bikini tops with like alacrity theyre clearly Disney Girls Gone Wild. And so thanks to the casting alone one brand of pop culture the titillating yet conservative kind cuts loose from its hypocritical moorings to morph into another brand the nakedly liberal sort. Its as if Uncle Walt back in the Beach Blanket Bingo days reached out a dirty paw to pull the drawstrings on busty Annette.Yet not one of the girls should be confused with anything remotely resembling an actual credible character. Instead theyre just nubile figures in the movies own video game which when the setting shifts to Florida simply repeats the opening montage and adds their breasts to the bouncing multitudes. Not surprisingly the dialogue is as scant as their attire and like Debies cinematography takes the hypnotic form of repeated mantras ""Its so great to get a break from reality"" or ""Its like paradise here."" But when the four get jailed after a coke fest paradise dims and the serpent appears.That would be Alien who sports a head of tight cornrows a mouth with more grill-work than a silver Cadillac a languid Southern drawl and a lascivious smile - a look that entirely complements his day job as dope dealer/gun runner/wannabe rapper. He bails out the girls then lures them to his den whereupon the light/bright tone downshifts into palpable menace. ""I just have a bad feeling"" whispers Faith before slipping away and so do we. The big bad gangsta is the predator the three remaining girls are the prey. Convention demands it.Except that Korine stands convention smack on its cornrowed head. Graduating with ease from toy guns to real the blondes proceed to teach the serpent a few hard lessons in garden-variety manners. ""Do you think you can just own us?"" one shouts wedging the gun barrel between his grillwork. For his part Alien proves a surprisingly good student. In the only piece of acting in the entire picture James Franco plays him with an underbelly of vulnerability a near-naivete beneath his macho swagger. And this injects a semblance of method into the apparent madness of the films most bizarre sequence Gathered outside around a white piano the girls stand armed for battle in bikinis topped with pink ski masks while Alien sits at the keyboard crooning a heartfelt rendition of Britney Spears Everytime.Some will see that moment and the movie that enshrines it as a shining example of female empowerment of young women exploiting their sexuality without being exploited by it. In that sense the gals want exactly what the film wants - to have it both ways to flaunt even while flouting to parade even while provoking to be a Playboy bunny with a Rottweilers bite.Obviously others will regard that same moment as just another in a long line of ludicrous ""breaks from reality."" And theyll be right too. Enlightened dream or empty nightmare you choose. For my part this much is certain When Spring Breakers was over the onrushing dream/nightmare ended I awoke with a keen desire to replay the whole tape again to watch it anew in the clear light of a northern day the better to do what our modern culture is ever asking us to do - sift the sense from the nonsense.

"Spring Breakers a dark ride in the sun review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSpring Breakers a dark ride in the sun reviewSpring Breakers written and directed by Harmony Korine is a dark dream-like tale of amorality and violence.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. March 28 2013Spring BreakersStarring James Franco Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine. Written and directed by Harmony Korine. 94 minutes. Opens March 29 at major theatres. As gulls screech overhead hot young bodies gyrate on the beach to the high-energy thrum of music. While young males quaff alcohol and cheer wildly girls run wild simulating fellatio with popsicles and letting their bare breasts bounce freely.""Spring break forever"" indeed.Article Continued BelowWriter/director Harmony Korine has taken us to some dark places with his youth-centred films such as Kids and Gummo. Spring Breakers set mostly in sunny Florida brings us into similar territory a land bereft of moral signposts.At a northern U.S. Christian college -- almost deserted because the student body has already decamped for warmer climes -- four friends bemoan that a shortage of funds prevents them from joining the annual spring exodus southward.""Are you jacked up on Jesus?"" thunders a youth pastor as Brit and Candy (Ashley Benson and Vanessa Hudgens) roll their eyes and make crude jokes about male genitalia.With Cotty (Rachel Korine wife of writer/director Korine) at the wheel of a car stolen from one of their instructors (and later torched) Brit and Candy rob a restaurant and menace its patrons with fake guns. Problem solved.""Just f----ing pretend its a videogame"" says Candy prior to the shakedown.The former star of Disneys High School Musical series Hudgens is obviously trying to break out of the teen queen mold and this role could not be more diametrically inimical to the shy brainy Gabriella Montez. A well-meaning coed warns Faith (former Justin Bieber squeeze and Disney Channel star Selena Gomez) to stay away from Brit and Candy warning they have ""demon blood."" But Faith the closest the film has to a character with a moral compass doesnt hesitate to go along for the ride.The foursomes well-funded Florida romp comes to a screeching halt when theyre busted while trashing a hotel room. Riding to the rescue is Alien (James Franco) a drug dealer and rapper wannabe replete with gold-capped teeth tattoos and dreadlocks who unexpectedly posts their bail.Franco is virtually unrecognizable as he immerses himself in the role. With his semi-literate southern twang he delivers a surprisingly textured performance a combination of bravado and naivete.Not so for the quartet of women including Faith the wet blanket of the group. Shes whiny and unsympathetic and when -- with a heavy sense of foreboding -- she decides to depart early she isnt missed.Cotty is distinguishable only by the pink highlights in her hair and the script barely allows her to register. Her premature departure again has no dramatic impact.The final two Brit and Candy are two interchangeable bleached-blonde sociopaths but are so similar physically and in character that they are hard to tell apart. (This may well be what director Korine intended.)""You girls is different from the rest"" an awestruck Alien notes.Korines story is a searing indictment of todays hedonistic nihilistic youth and his script is loaded with sharp telling dialogue that exposes the rotten moral cores of its characters. Its hard to root for any of them shallow and devoid of empathy as they all are. We are left to morbidly voyeuristically observe their odyssey of excess.Korine brings an auteurs sensibility to the film using repetitive phrases and hypnotic slo-mo visuals that makes us pause to consider the utter moral decay of the characters. But it also slows down the narrative in some ways and in the case of the violent climax draws attention to its implausibility.That said Spring Breakers is a deeply unsettling and memorable cinematic experience with a potent message about the relentless pursuit of pleasure at the cost of ones soul.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Its a bore. Starring Selena Gomez James Franco Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson Heather Morris Rachel Korine Ashley Lendzion Gucci Mane Director Harmony Korine Running time 134 Release Opened Mar 15 2013  Editorial Review Bikinis and so little to see hereBy Michael OSullivanFriday March 22 2013Based solely on ""Gummo"" I had high hopes for Harmony Korines latest film. That 1997 directorial debut of the controversial enfant terrible -- who had burst onto the scene at 19 with his script for Larry Clarks ""Kids"" -- has been variously compared to the art photography of Diane Arbus and to a gorgeous girl in a bikini whos been dragged through broken glass. I actually liked ""Gummo"" which is set in the freakshow underbelly of Xenia Ohio. Keep in mind that when I say ""liked"" I mean ""stared at with a mix of fascination and horror."" The films antihero is a glue-sniffer who kills cats to sell to a local restaurant supplier. Now subtract 95 percent of the fascination and all the horror -- and replace them with soul-crushing boredom -- and youve pretty much got my reaction to ""Spring Breakers"" Korines tedious St. Petersburg Fla.-set exercise in crime drama. What little fascination there is comes courtesy of James Franco who plays a corn-rowed dental-grill wearing drug dealer named Alien. The actor whose deep-fried performance consists mainly of waving automatic weapons while intoning the phrase ""spring break"" over and over and over again like some redneck war cry is at least mesmerizingly awful if repetitive. The plot to the extent that there is one revolves around Aliens attempt to recruit four nubile female coeds on spring break to a life of crime sex booze and drugs in no particular order. Its a 15-minute script padded out to 1 1 / 2 hours with scenes of degrading ""Girls Gone Wild""-style toplessness underage drinking and drug use and culminating in an absurd slow-motion shootout featuring bikini-clad gunmen in pink ski masks. How on earth is it possible for one film to be so tiresome? ""Spring Breakers"" isnt deadly dull despite all the nudity and violence but because of it. Korine quickly runs out of ideas -- if he ever had one -- and starts recycling almost immediately. The sound effect of a pistols slide being racked is utilized so frequently that it starts to lose all power. Besides Aliens chant-like mantra other lines of dialogue are repeated with slight variations in what appears to be an attempt to create a kaleidoscopic aural collage. Oh who am I kidding? Its simply bad filmmaking. A scene of Alien sitting at a white piano crooning the Britney Spears ballad ""Everytime"" will go down in history as one of the most unintentionally laughable scenes in the annals of cinema. And good luck distinguishing any one of the four female leads from any other. Aside from Selena Gomez who plays a semi-devout Christian named Faith there is no discernible difference between the characters portrayed by Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson or Rachel Korine (the directors wife). Korines treatment of women as interchangeable sex objects suitable only for leering at or snorting cocaine off of is honestly less offensive than his unwillingness -- or more likely his inability -- to give them roles that even remotely resemble human beings. If Korine thinks hes somehow being ironic detached or artistic forget it. Once a year St. Petersburg is awash with thoughtless unpleasant people making poor decisions. This spring Korine is one of them. Contains violence obscenity sex nudity and substance abuse.

Fast-forward nearly two decades. Korine now 40 is no longer the enfant terrible. Hes married a father and perhaps starting to chafe against the marginalization that comes with such willfully independent ventures as ""Gummo"" ""Julian Donkey-Boy"" and ""Mister Lonely."" His last film ""Trash Humpers"" was a fake found-footage romp about the exploits of senior citizens hooligans who roamed the slums at night causing mayhem. It appeared on several critics best and worst films of the year lists but scarcely caused a blip on the mainstream cultural radar. Korines new film ""Spring Breakers"" has already made a bigger splash and represents a rare potential intersection between the experimental art film and the multiplex. But it remains to be seen if fans of former Disney Channel starlets Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson will be thrilled or scandalized by what they see. Like ""Kids"" ""Spring Breakers"" suggests that young people behave very differently among their peers than they do with adults. Although the Christian goody two-shoes Faith (Gomez) eventually demurs her college classmates Candy (Hudgens) Brit (Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine Harmonys wife) just say yes to any proposition that comes their way no matter how sleazy. Time and again Harmony Korine cuts between the saccharine platitudes Faith feeds to her grandmother over the phone about how spring break in Florida has proved a positive and empowering experience and rather less salubrious footage of the rampant hedonism drug and alcohol abuse and orgiastic all-night parties the friends indulge in (some of which appears to be reality footage).JUST WATCHEDSelena Gomez annoyed by media scrutinyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSelena Gomez annoyed by media scrutiny 0147Even before taking off for Florida the girls stick up a restaurant to bankroll the trip. Hard to imagine Connie Francis putting on a latex face mask and yanking out an imitation automatic weapon back in her day. Part cautionary tale part leering lascivious walk on the wild side ""Spring Breakers"" doesnt quite fit into a conservative ""crime does not pay"" mold but when Faith resists the sweet advances dripped into her ear by James Francos tattooed gold-toothed corn-rowed drug dealer a silver-tongued Lucifer who calls himself Alien there is a palpable sense that virtue is its own reward.Alien is a grotesque creation a white rapper Tony Montana who bails the girls out of jail when he learns they have nothing more than the bikinis theyre standing in. But in Korines imagination these bored college kids are more debauched and dangerous than Alien dreams.Shot in hot lurid pinks and greens by Benoit Debie (""Enter the Void"") ""Spring Breakers"" has the quality of a fever dream a narcotic nightmare in which voices loop and echo into a mantra or a dirge and weird stunted self-contained scenes slip in and out of focus. Its a bad trip but a trip with moments of blitzed out bliss -- like the odd happy/sad communal moment around a grand piano one of Aliens unexpected toys when the dealer and his new entourage break into Britney Spears ""Baby One More Time.""The scene perfectly encapsulates the perverse mixture of childish innocence and excess that interests Korine and which makes ""Spring Breakers"" something more than a subversive stunt -- an authentically cracked expression of the crazy conflicting signals bombarding todays teenagers.

This lively exploitation flick follows four college cuties (Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine the filmmakers wife) as they pull off a masked hold-up of a diner and cash in hand go roaring off to Florida for the title bacchanal; upon their arrival they get mixed up with drug dealer James Franco (wearing cornrows and grills and channeling Eric Roberts). Korine gestures toward social criticism but essentially this is just an hour and a half of bongs beers tits and ass thinly dressed as Natural Born Killers. By J.R.

"Spring Breakers (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Spring Breakers (R) Mayhem under the sun. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/22/2013 Editor rating 3 ""Spring break forever"" is the mantra constantly spouted by Alien (James Franco) a drug-dealing thug whose goal in life is to be bad always do the wrong thing and make money. Alien sports grill in his mouth his hair dangles in ugly cornrows and his body is covered with tattoos (including a giant dollar sign on his neck). Above his bed hangs an arsenal of shotguns pistols swords and nunchuks. He keeps Scarface playing on a perpetual loop on his TV. And when he sees four college girls (Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine) being sent to jail after getting arrested in a raid he pays their bail and takes them under his evil wings. He becomes their Svengali figure -- a Peter Pan for these lost girls overcome by the craziness of St. Petersburg during spring break. Some of them wont be able to keep up with him though. Spring Breakers is the best and most accessible movie to date by writer-director Harmony Korine whose brash defiant attitude displayed in his earlier films (Gummo Julien Donkey-Boy) has matured into an earnest precise artistry (hes 40 now). Part of the subversive genius of Spring Breakers is the casting of actresses mostly known for Disney channel appearances suddenly thrust into a milieu of debauchery drugs and crime. The actresses fans most of them teenagers are in for a shock if they go in expecting a simple beach comedy. The movie is wild but not in the ways that you expect and its also surprisingly chaste -- you think you see a lot more than you actually do. Still High School Musical this is not. Korine is more interested in whats happening away from the corporate-sponsored wet T-shirt contests and pool parties. Hes drawn to the criminal undertow that rests below invisible to tourists but well known to the locals. Despite his frightening appearance and obvious insanity Franco is strangely charming and seductive You realize fairly soon that he means these girls no harm. He just wants to lure them into his own personal Neverland -- turn them into reflections of himself a pack of honeys for him to run with. Francos performance is so larger-than-life that the four heroines become blanks Only Gomez who plays a Catholic girl bluntly named Faith makes any kind of impression. By the time the girls have donned pink ski masks Franco is singing a lovely version of Britney Spears Everytime and the bullets are flying Spring Breakers has left behind all the kegs and bongs and entered far stranger surreal territory. This was a critical movie for Korine -- he needed to prove he could make a popular film without compromising his artistic sensibilities -- and he succeeds beyond expectations. Having fun has rarely felt this dangerous. Cast Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson Rachel Korine James Franco. Writer-director Harmony Korine.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 913pm on Thursday Mar. 21 2013 Thursday Mar. 21 2013 Thursday Mar. 21 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Spring Breakers will separate moviegoers into warring camps.On the one side are the multiplex multitudes who may be attracted by the teen-romp title and the presence of Vanessa Hudgens and North Texas sweetheart Selena Gomez thinking that this is going to be just some mildly salacious breezily disposable date-night fodder.On the other side are the cult-film connoisseurs familiar with the work of director/writer Harmony Korine screenwriter for Larry Clarks controversial 1995 film Kids and director of such oddly titled works as Trash Humpers (about a group of very strange elderly people) and Gummo (about a group of very strange small-town folk).While Korine defenders may be ready for his subversion even they may not be entirely prepared for the pop-culture brilliance that is Spring Breakers a manic mash-up of last years teensploitation housetrashing opus Project X Pulp Fiction Natural Born Killers and a Girls Gone Wild video. Only Spring Breakers has the added bonus of a transcendent performance from James Franco who makes up for his recent cinematic sins like Oz the Great and Powerful and Your Highness. If all that sounds horrifying then stay far far away.Candy (Hudgens) Cotty (Rachel Korine Harmonys wife) and Brit (Ashley Benson) are three bored college women at some nameless university who dont have enough money to take the spring-break vacation of their dreams. Raised in a world where delayed gratification is as foreign a concept as Euclidean geometry they decide to hold up a fast-food joint.Flush with cash they head for Floridas St. Petersburg Beach with their more straight-laced but equally bored friend Faith (Gomez) in tow. Once there they make it rain in a cloudburst of alcohol pot cocaine and drunken shirtless dudes pumpin their fists to an endless loop of dubstep and hip-hop.Its all fun and games -- until it isnt. This is when the film which Harmony Korine begins in a leisurely style that sometimes feels more like an R-rated music video takes a turn to the dark side.The girls are arrested and then bailed out by a man they dont know who goes by the name of Alien (Franco). With his hair in cornrows and grills on his teeth Franco disappears into the role of a small-time hustler and gun-toting gangster who preys on naive spring breakers. He displays a loose-limbed intensity that is both frightening and ferociously funny.But Candy Cotty and Brit dont play the victims to his predator. They know exactly what hes up to and dont care as they get sucked into his world of beatdowns and braggadocio becoming his ride-or-die accomplices.Harmony Korine displays a playful visual eye as the many party scenes become a beachfront Hieronymus Bosch orgy of sex and skin. He also possesses a good ear with Skrillexs dubstep mainstay Scary Monters and Nice Sprites part of a booming soundtrack of beer-soaked seduction and wanton criminality.Rachel Korine Benson and Hudgens (who already stepped out of the High School Musical shadow with the ambitious but failed Sucker Punch) show off a compelling sense of their growing thuggish empowerment. As for Gomez she doesnt have much to do but cry and wish to go home; shes gone from the movie once things start to get really nasty so her clean image isnt sullied too much.Yet its Francos performance swollen with chest-pumping swagger and street-corner ambition that you remember.Thats something people on both sides of the Spring Breakers divide can agree upon.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune March 23 2013 -- 346pm Video (3300)  ""Spring Breakers"" Harmony Korines R-rated tale of four college girls on a debauched party trip starring James Franco and Selena Gomez. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Having been an enfant terrible for half his life indie provocateur Harmony Korine knows his way around a youth-in-crisis movie. The 40-year-old filmmaker broke out in 1995 with his controversial screenplay for ""Kids"" an amoral crudely sensational account of underage sex and drug abuse by teenage New York City gangs. After multiple microscopic art-house experiments hes back in your face and at your throat with a juvenile-delinquent story that can stand alongside ""Pixote"" ""Rivers Edge"" and ""13."" Korines ""Spring Breakers"" is ""Girls Gone Wild"" meets ""Natural Born Killers"" with a chaser of social satire. This time the kids are a little older (college students who should know better) the body count budget and star power are higher. Grinning villain James Franco trowels sleaze across Disney Channel sweethearts Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens ABC Familys Ashley Benson and Korines young wife Rachel. It turns Tampa into a diseased theme park of the imagination. The actresses play prayerful brunette Faith and her wild child blonde BFFs Candy Brit and Cotty. They dont seem to be learning much at their nameless alma mater (a darkened lecture hall where every face is lit by its own glowing laptop suggests a catacomb for deceased minds). The girls do know that they need deserve must have a debauched March getaway. The three blondes stick up a Chicken Shack with a squirt gun a sledgehammer and a lot of nerve. Faith doesnt participate in the heist but she goes along for the giddy excessive ride from Nowheresville to Florida ingesting every mood-altering substance known to the Sunshine State. The girls defiant quest for independence and adventure quickly sours. The montage of bangin young bodies rivers of booze and bricks of dope might look like Nirvana for a minute but Korine firmly pushes our noses in the scenes squalid stupidity. Arrested on drug charges the coeds are bailed out by small-time drug thug Alien (Franco). Faith flees for the safety of her hometown prayer circle while Alien spins his web around the remaining three. He tries to impress them with his gangsta tattoos cornrows tacky Camaro convertible and gun collection inviting them into his cracked vision of the American dream. Annapurna Pictures Rachel Korine Selena Gomez Ashley Benson James Franco and Vanessa Hudgens in ""Spring Breakers."" But hes underestimated these ambitious girls. They know something about using their sexuality for power turning the tables and making him simulate oral sex on handguns. ""I think I just fell in love"" he gasps recruiting his dream girls for a showdown with a much better-armed dealer Archie (rapper Gucci Mane). Candy and Britt slip into lime bikinis and pink ski masks grab machine pistols and invade the enemy fortress alongside Alien. ""Pretend like its a video game"" the girls tell each other. ""Act like youre in a movie."" The violence when it comes shocks and awes because the beauty of the earlier scenes held you with such hypnotic power. Apt students Candy and Britt ultimately surpass Alien tooling back to school in a tangerine Lamborghini. Dont mistake this for an ad pushing the gangster lifestyle. ""Spring Breakers"" traffics in visceral thrills but doesnt side with its pretty young nihilists. When the girls fire bullets into human flesh as if they were playing ""Call of Duty"" we dont feel the same visceral thrill the girls evidently do. If you do get off on those exploitive images I hope you are reading this from inside something that has a good strong lock. Still the craft brought to bear on this fever dream is undeniable. Belgian cinematographer Benoit Debie gives us exquisitely composed shots impressionistic plays of shadow and orchestrated hues of brake-light reds marine blues and arsenic greens. The sonic pulse is beat-heavy dance floor noise from Skrillex. By turns gonzo and ghastly this youth culture nightmare is deliberately structured to feel like a party thats gone on too long. You may enjoy parts of the ride but youre grateful for the exits. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

A24 hide caption toggle caption A24 Spring Breakers Director Harmony Korine Genre Comedy Drama Running Time 94 minutes Rated R for strong sexual content language nudity drug use and violence With Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens James Franco Gucci Mane In the 70s and even into the 80s exploitation movies used to come to us naked and innocent rarely pretending to be anything more than what they were. Now pictures intent on delivering cheap thrills tend to arrive dressed in art-house costumes much like the ones Harmony Korines killer college girls wear in his arch little sociological study Spring Breakers. On the night they commit their deadliest deeds these girls-gone-wild slip pastel ski masks over their beachy-blond heads. Only the girls eyes and their Crest Strip-white teeth show through the little holes They look like pink ninja chipmunks. Spring Breakers is half action comedy half moral meditation on the sorry state of youth today which is maybe what youd expect from writer-director Korine the guy who first sounded the youth-in-danger alarm nearly 20 years ago with his screenplay for Kids. Although parts of Spring Breakers are very funny theres also something tsk-tsking and superior about it as if Korine had thought a lot about young middle Americas idea of midsemester fun and decided he doesnt like it one tiny bit. But that doesnt mean he eschews the scenery. As Spring Breakers opens four young women bored to tears while stuck at some dreadfully landlocked college yearn to cut loose and run semi-naked and free on the Florida coast. Problem is Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine the directors wife) dont have enough money to make the trip. Even though theyve taken a fourth (rather innocent) little chick under their wings -- Selena Gomezs aptly named Faith -- they just cant scrape together the necessary dough. So the three of them unbeknownst to Faith hold up a local restaurant -- with fake guns though they also employ some noisy hammers as a scare tactic -- and thanks to the wonders of quick time-defying cutting its barely a matter of minutes before theyre prancing around in the Florida sun wearing nothing but bikinis and sneakers. Compared with some of the other nubile young hotties who drift past Korines lens -- he favors color-drenched pans and just-out-of-film-school slow-motion effects -- these four seem relatively innocent. (Others are doffing their bikini tops joyfully; just about everyone male and female is clearly overdoing it on the beer.) After a few days though our four comely cuties go off with some local bad guys snort some cocaine and run afoul of the law landing themselves in jail. A local operator known as Alien (played by James Franco with cornrows and a glittery platinum grill) bails them out and makes off with them ostensibly just waiting for the moment when he can do really bad things with -- or to -- them. i Wanna-be gangsta rapper and drug lord Alien (James Franco) takes the vacationing college students under his wing after they get arrested during their spring break. A24 hide caption toggle caption A24 Wanna-be gangsta rapper and drug lord Alien (James Franco) takes the vacationing college students under his wing after they get arrested during their spring break. A24 Yet thats not exactly how Spring Breakers unfolds and however exasperating Korine may be as a filmmaker he still pulls off some surprises. The picture is filled with phony experimentalism -- its not nearly as daring or as compelling as Korine thinks it is. Bits of the story are told out of sequence; now and then one girl or another will recite in moony voice-over a letter home vaguely referencing the ""good time"" shes having or expressing eagerness real or feigned to get back and settle down to what really matters. Its hard to know exactly whats happening when which is part of the plan. Korine is making a statement here. At one point Alien -- who makes a handsome living as a drug and arms dealer and runs Scarface on a loop as a constant source of inspiration -- sits down at the keys of a white outdoor piano tinkling along sensitively to the strains of Britney Spears ""Everytime"" as the girls twirl about like music-box ballerinas in those aforementioned pink balaclavas. The moment is so avant-garde its square. That sums up the whole movie come to think of it. Korine is tap-dancing so fast that its never really clear exactly what hes up to but none of it adds up to much in the end. Franco turns his performance into one massive look-at-me stunt and admittedly its hard to take your eyes off him Those shiny metallic teeth are mesmerizing -- theyre reminiscent of an older cozier symbol of American success the grill of a Cadillac. Alien likes his money and he loves what it can buy. (He delivers a hilarious monologue detailing his favorite things which decidedly do not include raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens.) Franco is amusing until his shtick wears thin. And the spring breakers themselves -- even the effervescent charmer Hudgens -- are basically interchangeable right up through the movies final tastefully violent spree. Only Gomez as the churchgoing sweetheart Faith distinguishes herself. The actress plays a character not just a state of being -- she manages to put some thought and discernment behind Faiths innocence. Its little wonder Faith is Aliens favorite. Shes the one character in the movie that not even Korine the mastermind behind this feverish shockeroo exercise can fully control.

"Movie review Spring Breakers - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Spring Breakers is mesmerizing Share Tweet Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 03.21.13 | 451 PM I derive no small pleasure from the thought of Americas youth flocking to see ""Spring Breakers"" expecting -- well what youd expect a film called ""Spring Breakers"" to be -- and finding instead a savage assault on every empty thought they hold dear. At first glimpse the movie is frat-comedy business as usual images of half-clad college kids reveling in slow motion on the beaches of St. Petersburg Fla. But the shots are held too long and the faces are dull-eyed and grotesque; the beer tubes and bong hits and naked breasts shade from bacchanalian to robotic. We seem to have left MTVs spring break and entered David Lynchs. Related Links Find showtimes and theaters Check out scenes from spring break Actually this universe belongs to Harmony Korine the brat provocateur whose previous movies -- including 1995s ""Kids"" (which he only wrote but everyone gives him credit for anyway) 1997s ""Gummo"" and 2009s ""Trash Humpers"" -- have enraged proper-thinking audiences and critics while building a small devoted base of cult followers. With the nominally mainstream ""Spring Breakers"" count me in. Korine wants to give us a portrait of our nations children -- the girls especially -- as beautifully depraved sharks pleasure-seeking killers oblivious to the comedy and horror of their existence. And damned if he doesnt pull it off or come close enough. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The cheapest subversion in ""Spring Breakers"" -- although its still pretty effective -- is the casting of a handful of our leading TV innocents in lead roles. Selena Gomez of Disney Channels ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" plays Faith an evangelical good girl dreaming of going bad while Ashley Benson of ABC Familys ""Pretty Little Liars"" and Vanessa Hudgens of Disneys ""High School Musical"" franchise are respectively Brit and Candy the soulless collegiate party rats with whom Faith hooks up. (The directors wife Rachel plays Cotty the most slatternly member of the crew.) Whats shocking isnt the sight of Hudgens -- whose Disney persona was rigidly virginal -- sucking on bongs and drawing penii on her class notes. Rather its the dreamy candy-colored ferocity of the filmmaking. Every moment in ""Spring Breakers"" feels like an eternal Now that never satisfies; the only moving force is toward the next druggy thrill. Faiths musings on freedom and happiness -- half-baked adolescent poetry -- echo on the soundtrack like banal Facebook posts. Short of money to get to St. Pete the girls steal a car and rob a restaurant (Korines camera peers through the windows from outside Its the getaway-car angle). Assault with a deadly weapon and grand theft auto? OMG After a few days of sybaritic partying -- during which Faith thinks shes found a new Eden and Cotty comes close enough to getting raped to make you shrink from the screen -- the cops bust a motel party and the four spend a night in jail. Theyre bailed out by Alien a local drug dealer/wannabe rapper with greasy cornrows and really bad grills. It may take you a few minutes to realize youre watching James Franco. Yes Im pretty sick of him too but not after this; the role isnt a comeback so much as a doubling down. He plays Alien like a street-corner snake charmer -- Oz the small and sleazy -- oozing bravado as he seduces the girls into his orbit. Yet the brilliance of the performance is that the characters barely up to his own badass myth. At first I thought this might have been a better role for Matthew McConaughey until I realized Franco is playing Alien as if he were McConaugheys kid brother. Hes dangerous but he also wants to be dangerous and its that puppyish need that weakens him. The girls particularly Brit and Candy dont want to be dangerous. They just are and ""Spring Breakers"" evolves into a sort of over-the-top staring contest in which the first person to break concentration ends up on the bus back home. (The mid-movie standoff between Alien and Faith is a nervy high point and may be the best acting Gomez will ever do.) Korine likes the poetics of transgression and he trowels on the bad behavior with a heavy but mesmerizing hand. ""Spring Breakers"" is pregnant with imminent violence; characters wallow in cash and guns; cocaine gets snorted off every surface imaginable and a few unimaginable. Its Too Much and often just too much. Korine has seen an awful lot of Jean-Luc Godards 60s movies (I dont think you can see too many) and his borrowed Pop Art devices -- repetitive voice-overs gunshots and barrel clicks as aural counterpoint mechanistic nods to 1983s ""Scarface"" -- turn wearyingly familiar before the end. Hes still going where few American filmmakers dare right into Americas hedonistic heart of darkness. ""Spring Breakers"" is the horror movie glimpsed behind ""Superbad"" and ""21 and Over"" and all those other celebrations of the right to party yourself into a coma. The movie says that if this is what your culture sells you these are the kids youll end up with. Yet its anything but a lecture or even a cautionary tale and it stands to infuriate parents and other moral guardians as much as it discombobulates their children. Korine loves his pretty little animals the way a renegade zoologist loves the lemmings he studies as they mate and chew pieces off each other and eventually jump straight off the cliff. At a certain point after Alien has entered into a street war with a rival gangbanger (rapper Gucci Mane) and before Brit and Candy don pink unicorn-emblazoned ski masks and pick up assault rifles the film spirals off the page into possible fantasy. Is any of this really happening? Or is it all a college girls daydream as she sits doodling in a lecture hall? Neither or both -- it doesnt really matter not when Korine is having Alien and the girls sing Britney Spearss ""Everytime"" (to them its an oldie) at an outdoor grand piano before engaging in a swimming pool orgy that feels surreal to the point of anatomical impossibility. Theres much more (and less) than Tarantino-style cleverness going on here; Korine delivers a teenage apocalypse thats shocking and stupid and exhilarating and tender in equal measure. ""Spring Breakers"" fuses our worst nightmares and most reckless dreams of freedom until the two become indistinguishable. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Ashley Benson (left) Vanessa Hudgens Rachel Korine and Selena Gomez star in ""Spring Breakers"" a film thats easy to hate at first but has much more going for it than you might expect. Photo Annapurna Pictures Spring Breakers review brilliantly twisted 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Spring Breakers Drama. Starring James Franco Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Selena Gomez. Directed by Harmony Korine. (R. 96 minutes.) Where to start with ""Spring Breakers"" one of the most audacious and polarizing sexual journeys to reach the multiplex since what? ""Eyes Wide Shut""? ""Wild Things""? No this is new ground being tread by Harmony Korine the ""Kids"" and ""Gummo"" writer who seems as allergic to traditional narrative format as he is addicted to soulless characters and violence-hued debauchery. As a director he challenges audiences to reject his film as pure exploitation only to fish them back in when theyre on the brink of walking out of the theater. Its not enough to make a piece of pulp art. Korine adds a degree of difficulty asking audiences to hate his film before realizing what theyve seen has cinematic merit. ""Spring Breakers"" examines four female college students on a rabbit hole of a vacation to St. Petersburg Fla. The Florida tourism bureau will not be pleased. What follows is a high-wire act for film critics who must simultaneously warn audiences about the content try to explain its fever-dream presentation defend their appreciation of the often depraved material and (perhaps most difficult) describe James Francos performance. Franco as the drug dealer Alien is almost unrecognizable in silver-capped teeth cornrows and an accent that borrows equally from Lil Jon and Matthew McConaughey. Not just difficult to recognize from Francos previous movie roles. Unrecognizable from humanity. Francos antagonist boasts about his board shorts collection does (disarmingly touching) Britney Spears covers on a white grand piano and pilots an orange sherbet Camaro with the license plate ""BALLR."" All while transforming the most vile character in the movie into something approaching sympathetic. Its a brilliant turn - that Academy Awards hosting bomb is forgiven along with the next two films that Franco decides to sleepwalk through. The first few minutes of ""Spring Breakers"" is little more than slow-motion bare breasts beer bonging and suggestive popsicle sucking impossible to distinguish from a ""Girls Gone Wild"" cassette except for the dreamy Terrence Malick vibe set by cinematographer Benoit Debie. (Korine must be a Malick fan - he borrows that directors ethereal narration as well.) The actresses playing the college girls include former teen darlings Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens executing a two-middle-fingers-in-the-air scorched earth attack on their Disney reputations. Desperate to experience spring break the girls execute an armed robbery - the startling getaway driver-view footage of the crime is the first major sign that this might be a real movie - and use the money to get to Florida. After a bacchanalian frenzy and a predatory rescue by Alien things get disturbingly weird gloriously weird and then semi-coherent for a few minutes before a Peckinpah-inspired acid trip of a finale. All the while Korine screws with time and space like a 3-year-old fiddling with the rewind key on his dads stereo. The wheels on the bus go round and round. The wheels on the bus ... The wheels ... What should be infuriating makes sense in the context of the directors twisted cinematic rulebook. The female actors particularly Hudgens and Ashley Benson are game for the ride. And Franco is indispensable bringing humor and pathos to one of the more repulsive cinematic creations in recent memory. It would be easy to blow holes in the logic of the movie (no one spent time teaching the actresses how to hold a gun convincingly) if Korine was attempting realism. You dont walk away from ""Spring Breakers"" learning a single thing about spring break the criminal mind or even sex. It wouldnt be surprising to learn that Korine has never been to Florida. Ultimately it doesnt matter. Theres nothing going on in St. Petersburg thats more interesting than the twisted inspiration that ricochets around this writer/directors head.

"Spring Breakers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; spring-breakers ) Spring Breakers (United States 2013) March 21 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli When one considers the phenomenon of ""Spring Break"" images of bikini-clad young women bronzed guys and inhibition-shedding parties fill the minds eye. In general Hollywood has used Spring Break as a jumping-off point for comedies - some romantic some raunchy and some a little of both - but most of those movies emphasize the ""fun"" in the situation. The equation of ""drugs+booze+sex=happy ending"" applies. Then along comes Harmony Korine with Spring Breakers and subverts an entire genre. By design Spring Breakers looks like its going to be just another fun-in-the-sun outing. Korine starts out with beach shots that more often than not look like commercials for Girls Gone Wild color-rich images of sunsets and scenes of a 24/7 party lifestyle. Its the kind of advertising campaign that will get college students out of their dorms and onto buses and planes. But Korine isnt making a feather-light comedy. In fact he isnt making a comedy at all. Nor is Spring Breakers and exploitation flick despite the high Tamp;A quotient. This is a serious ""message movie."" In fact its so serious that at times it stumbles under the weight of its own self-importance. Distilled to its bitter essence Spring Breakers is a condemnation of the shallowness of todays youth. Its not a denunciation of partying in general but of a lifestyle that becomes defined by partying. It shows that all the pretty shots and sexually-charged images can hide something decayed and ugly. Korine also manages to transform what might be considered a happy ending in another movie into a moment of sadness. In fact its not hard to see how this story in the hands of another director with a different agenda could in fact be just another raunchy Spring Break comedy. One of the knocks against Korine over the years has been his predilection for pretentiousness and although its toned down in Spring Breakers it remains in evidence. There are times when he cant get out of his own way. He has a tendency toward showing off visually as if to prove that hes a serious artist. This is most evident it the way he varies the way scenes are presented - natural color desaturated to nearly black-and-white and so forth. Its more distracting than effective. Theres not much of a narrative to speak of. Four college girls - Faith (Selena Gomez) Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Korines wife Rachel) - head down to Florida for a few days of partying. They fall under the spell of a low-level rapper and drug-dealer Alien (James Franco) and join up with him - except Faith who breaks from the group and heads home. None of the characters are deeply drawn. We feel the most strongly for Faith because shes the most relatable of them the good Christian girl experiencing her moment of rebellion and discovering it takes her too far outside her comfort zone. Everyone else pretty much goes with the flow no matter how dark and bumpy it becomes. Korines key stylistic element and the one that works the most successfully is a penchant for repetition. Many lines are spoken more than once and some are repeated four five or six times. To understand where Korine is coming from combine this with dialogue in which Faith states that the reason everyone is bored and depressed is that they live every day seeing and experiencing the same things. Faith has a soul but the other three - Candy Brit and Cotty - are rotten inside. Theyre in it for the experience of the moment. They have no understanding of consequences. Its frightening. They commit a robbery because it seems like a good quick way to get some cash. When theyre playing around with loaded weapons it doesnt matter whether one goes off. These arent three good girls who have shed their inhibitions for a week of hedonism; this is something much much darker. This is the territory where sociopathy meets normalcy where the desensitization of conscience opens up terrifying possibilities. In another movie these girls would be sex objects. In Spring Breakers were all too aware of what lurks under the pretty packaging. Much of the publicity surrounding Spring Breakers has related to the participation of three former teenage stars Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson. (The fourth girl Rachel Korine has little experience outside of acting in a few indie films.) Like many who have developed under the ""family entertainment"" banner they are seeking to broaden their horizons and be seen as serious performers. Its the Anne Hathaway approach start out clean then make the break by trying something gritty. Gomez arguably the best actress in the group stretches the least. She never takes her clothing off doesnt swear and departs before things get really out-of-control. Shes completely believable as the good girl out of her depth. Hudgens and Benson swear like truckers engage in all sorts of drinking and drug use and have a peek-a-boo threeway with James Franco in a pool. Their performances are unsettling which is precisely whats intended. Rachel Korine is right up there with them the only difference being that her nudity is more blatant. Then theres Franco whos giving one of the most off-the-wall portrayals of his career. I was a little reminded of Matthew McConaughey in Killer Joe although perhaps the fellatio imagery has something to do with it. Spring Breakers isnt for the crowd looking to be titillated and entertained in a light breezy manner. The titillation is a hook; the material itself is dark and uncompromising. This isnt mainstream fare although its probably the most straightforward material Korine has been involved in since Kids (which he wrote for director Larry Clark). The strengths more than counterbalance the weaknesses and help Spring Breakers to deliver a more disturbing and substantive experience than one might expect from an exploitation-tinged title.

Devilishly testing the boundaries of good taste and good sense ""Spring Breakers"" is like the love child of ""Scarface"" and ""Girls Gone Wild.""There are valid reasons to send it to detention from a director with a checkered history to the crass casting of some ex-Disney moppets to the racially provocative presence of James Franco as a rappin crack dealer.But its so flashy and hyperactive it demands attention -- and then rewards it with a cookie of caustic insight. Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine play stir-crazy coeds in Small Town USA but even before the latter three characters steal a professors car don ski masks and rob a diner for bus fare the smell of impending trouble is as strong as suntan lotion and stale beer.In the opening credit sequence director Harmony Korine (who debuted as a teenage screenwriter with the quasi-documentary shocker ""Kids"") sets the scene at the beach destination with slo-mo shots of bare-breasted bunnies getting soaked with suds and other fluids by hard-bodied horndogs. Gomezs character not so subtly named Faith is a churchgoer who tries to behave herself in St. Pete but the other girls are not only willing participants in the debauchery they are foul-mouthed instigators. When a night snorting coke at a crash pad lands the girls in jail they are bailed out by local rapper Alien (Franco) a dreadlocked gold-toothed doofus who thinks hes da bomb because hes got a convertible Camaro two different Calvin Klein fragrances and a beach house full of firearms. But the girls are just as idiotic as he is and soon he seduces them into riding shotgun as he goes to war against a rival drug dealer.With a greater emphasis on sex than violence ""Spring Breakers"" is a more enjoyable guilty pleasure than ""Natural Born Killers"" and just as acute about our cultural devolution.

"Spring Breakers movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Spring Breakers Trouble where the bad girls are  Spring Breakers Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune No animals were harmed in the making of ""Spring Breakers."" But plenty of impressionable young and older minds will assuredly experience feelings of disorientation watching writer-director Harmony Korines candy-colored clown of a movie which starts out like a salacious rump-centric and blithely bare-breasted hip-hop video and ends up in the realm of scary and inspired trash.Thats not meant negatively. Korine is a resolute sleaze monger whose nightmarish daydreams include ""Trash Humpers"" along with the script of Larry Clarks specious ""Kids."" He cares little for directorial impulse control. Half the time he doesnt know if and when hes kidding and when hes serious. All this helps ""Spring Breakers"" however in which not-so-innocent debauchery turns sociopathic on a dime. Its about four teenage Southern college girls three nasty one nice. The nice one a good Christian believer is played by Selena Gomez. The others her spring break traveling companions are played by Ashley Benson Vanessa Hudgens and Rachel Korine the directors wife. Determined to have a memorable vacation the girls lack hotel and booze money (also cocaine money and marijuana money) and in a beautiful glide-by tracking sequence were shown how they obtain the needed cash. Its a restaurant robbery and from the cameras exterior perspective the girls fake-pistol-waving attacks on the customers look felonious but not vicious. Later however ""Spring Breakers"" returns to the same sequence this time inside the diner with the customers. And its not the same story.Director Korine plays this entire lark right down the middle. Its the old story in Korines script The girls tell themselves theyre acting as if theyre in a movie and like natural-born killers theyre simply playing the roles of the hell-raisers on parade amid a Florida packed with gleaming flesh. Sprung from a night in jail for crimes unrelated to the robbery Brit Faith Candy and Cotty owe their bailout to the predatory goodwill of a gangsta rappa named Alien. He is played by James Franco currently on a very different set of movie screens in ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Those who write off Franco as a limited one-note actor need to see ""Spring Breakers."" Hes smooth funny sinister and alive every second in this strange riff on ""Where the Boys Are."" The film is worth seeing simply for the montage in which this self-made playa displays to his latest prey all the great stuff he owns from nunchucks to pistols to cunning home furnishings.As he has in past works Korine pushes and pulls the episodes of his films this way and that repeating incidents foreshadowing others. The character Alien appears to have been weaned on a steady viewing diet of ""Wild Things""; he lives his tricked-out life like a perverted Gulf Coast version of Puck.Korine has become a very interesting filmmaker with ""Spring Breakers."" He samples every sort of music-video trick and change-up yet the referencing works. The Gomez character provides the necessary outsiders shock and awe; most everything else about Korines inversion of an entire genre risks excess and then a surfeit of excess followed by an excessive surfeit of excess. Its a beach-party movie that morphs into a ""Scarface"" remake this time without Pacino. And with an even less reliable moral compass.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for violence language and sexual content)Running time 134Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Spring Breakers (movie) Theft Larry Clark Ashley Benson Oz the Great and Powerful (movie) Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

Spring Breakers Mordant Satire of Our Sexed-Up Culture? Or Exploitative Garbage? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 20 2013 750 PM Spring Breakers Dead-on satire of our sexed-up culture or dull piece of exploitative garbage? By Dana Stevens Spring Breakers Photo courtesy of Muse Productions There seem to be two critical perspectives on Spring Breakers. Is the veteran provocateur Harmony Korines most mainstream movie yet--the story of four college girls who go a little too wild on a party trip to Florida--a dead-on formalist send-up of our of cultures sick obsession with guns drugs and the sexual exploitation of young women? Or is it a stultifyingly dull piece of exploitative garbage? This false binary misapprehends the central Harmony Korine stratagem which is to ensure that the viewer can have it both ways. The director of Gummo Mister Lonely Julien Donkey-Boy and Trash Humpers creates objects that are somewhere between movies and performance-art projects. Often deliberately crude in their construction Korines affectless spectacles comment on debauchery alienation and sexism by unironically even lecherously wallowing in them. You could attend a matinee screening of Spring Breakers with an eye toward either writing your masters thesis or masturbating. Im fairly sure there were attendees at the daytime showing I caught with both aims in mind. One guy actually brought a raincoat. The nubile female bodies you will be watching bounce around in slow motion (at least in the foreground; there are a lot of others behind them) belong to Vanessa Hudgens Selena Gomez Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine. The last of those is the directors wife; the first three are TV and/or pop stars known for their participation in wholesome Disney entertainments like High School Musical and Pretty Little Liars. So theres a lot of symbolic reputation-sullying to get through as the ingenues strive to rebrand themselves as game-for-anything postmodern starlets. Spring Breakers doesnt show much in the way of graphic sex acts though theres one dont-try-this-at-home scene of man-on-gun fellatio. But it does contain lots and lots of gyrating bikini-clad T-and-A including one slo-mo shot of a beach full of booty-shaking teens that recurs at several points throughout the movie. Advertisement Theres a lot of shot-for-shot repetition in Spring Breakers as the movie vamps to fill its 93 minutes of screen time. Like the flatness of the barely distinguishable female characters this redundancy is probably meant as a deliberate strategy of depersonalization but it depersonalized this viewer to such a degree all she could think about was where to go after for a good Vietnamese lunch. The central quartet of coeds bear the names Brit Candy Cotty and Faith--I have no idea which one is which except that Selena Gomez must be Faith because shes a brunette and believes in God. Her three faithless blonde friends convince her to come with them on a spring-break blowout that theyve financed by holding up a diner at gunpoint (the crime is filmed in a single long take as seen from the moving getaway car in one of the few scenes that deploys not coy artlessness but actual art). Youd think nothing could go wrong on a vacation financed by an armed robbery but once the girls get down to Florida things start to go even further south. After a few nights of paradisiacal partying (cue the B-roll of topless chicks funneling down beer in slo-mo) theyre apprehended on possession charges and put in jail for the night deprived even of the basic civil right of cover-ups for their bikinis. In the morning theyre released their bail paid by a local gangster and party DJ known as Alien (James Franco in a metal grill and cornrows with a Southern accent that splits the difference between Honey Boo Boo and Foghorn Leghorn). The last quarter of the movie takes an unexpected swerve into Natural Born Killers crime-spree territory. Alien offers the girls shelter at his gun- cash- and drug-filled hideout and attempts to recruit them as his personal armed harem only to find they have a few tricks up their thongs. When the girls clad in DTF sweatpants bikini tops and neon-pink ski masks gather around Aliens white grand piano to sing his favorite Britney Spears song the image has a lurid beauty as does a black-lit upside-down shot of two of the girls running at full speed into what looks like a suicidal showdown. But by that point its too late to invest in either Spring Breakers aesthetics or its story. To evaluate the performances in Spring Breakers makes little sense since the actors (the female ones especially) are barely playing characters at all. Selena Gomezs polished emotionally straightforward performance as the nice pious girl gone bad--she could easily be acting in a Lifetime TV drama--makes as much sense in this context as James Francos campy swanning one. Vanessa Hudgens expectations-defying turn as the most hardcore of all the spring-breakers has flashes of nasty wit. But any distinctions among the four main girls are flattened out by Korines studiedly affectless dialogue. Any irregularity in tone becomes a part of the movies intentionally rough imperfect surface--a formal strategy I might find interesting if I could make head or tail of what the movie thats using it is trying to say. But Im probably falling into Spring Breakers trap by expecting it to say mean or be anything other than what it is. This movies whole project is to linger for as long as possible on the surface of our ugly misogynist death-worshipping pop culture yes but also on the surface of female bodies offered up freely for our (and quite obviously the directors) delectation. Is Korines intent to confront viewers with their own voyeuristic complicity in the spiritually empty world the movie forces us to inhabit? Or just to get that guy in the back row off? Neither answer will keep me from eyeing the exits. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Spring Breakers 3.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Spring Breakers 3.5 stars James Franco in a scene from ""Spring Breakers.""Michael Muller/A24 Films SHARE URL EMAIL FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Spring Breakers Fair to good 3.5 stars Director Harmony Korine.Cast Vanessa Hudgens Selena Gomez James Franco.Rating R for strong sexual content language nudity drug use and violence throughout. RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Selena Gomez breaks out with Spring Breakers By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Mar 20 2013 1018 AM There are probably as many reasons not to watch ""Spring Breakers"" are there are to watch it. But you need to see it because one reason outweighs all the competing others. You could watch to see former Disney good girls go bad. Or you could skip that because you didnt really catch ""The Wizards of Waverly Place"" or the ""High School Musical"" movies anyway so the transformation would be meaningless. You could watch to see writer and director Harmony Korines dismantling of spring-break culture the bare-breasted beer-and-booze-basted bacchanalia that attracts college students every year and gives newspaper websites a gold mine of hits with picture slideshows. Or you could skip it by arguing that putting his actresses in skimpy bikinis and not skimping on the skin and party-all-the-time atmosphere Korine is simply playing into the culture. Discuss debate. But there is no doubt about this James Francos performance alone is worth the price of admission. Sporting cornrows and grillz and a hilarious cornpone accent he plays a drug-dealing would-be rapper who calls himself Alien because ""Im from another planet yall."" (Naturally.) Franco manages to be disturbing charming dangerous and oddly enough kind of sweet in a really really misguided sort of way. Its nuts. After some introductory shots of what we all associate with spring break (see bare breasts beer etc.) Korine takes us to an unnamed college where friends Brit (Ashley Benson) Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) and Cotty (Rachel Korine Harmonys wife) lament that they dont have the money to go to spring break. What to do? Rob a restaurant with water pistols and a sledgehammer. What else? Armed with cash they and their more religious-minded friend Faith (Selena Gomez) head for Florida. Once there they fall into predictable behavior (though Faith is a little wary and calls her grandmother to check in). Then they get arrested. The sight of them standing before the judge in bikinis handcuffs and sneakers is notable and noted by Alien who bails them out and takes them to his lavish spread. His money his drugs his guns and everything else hes accumulated makes a favorable impression on everyone but Faith whose discomfort around Alien mirrors our own. That said its hard not to get sucked in when Alien jumps up and down on his bed bouncing among his drugs his money his guns yelling again and again ""Look at my (stuff)"" Its hilarious and kind of horrifying. The same might be said of Alien playing Britney Spears ""Everytime"" while the girls dance in bikinis and ski masks while caressing automatic weapons. He certainly knows how to make an impression. Korine will go to darker places as an old feud is settled. That lends some action however oddly placed in a film that despite all the sex and drugs and whatever else is also ponderous (go figure). Korine replays scenes and lines of dialogue over and over either as an artistic statement or just for the hell of it. Either option seems equally likely. The shock value of seeing Hudgens and Gomez breaking out of the Disney mold wears thin pretty quickly. And Korine seems determined to test his audience with his repetition. But what stays with you is Franco one of the more enigmatic actors around going way over the top yet grounding his performance in ... something. Whatever it is its more interesting than all the wet T-shirt contests in the world and it makes ""Spring Breakers"" worth watching. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

By David Edelstein Starring Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez this beach-party pic is a giant middle finger in Disneys direction. 413 Shares Share 371 Tweet 40 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo Michael Muller Teens tweens and middle-aged men are drooling with anticipation over Harmony Korines Spring Breakers a hard-R-rated beach-party picture starring three starlets from the Disney entertainment megaverse Vanessa Hudgens (High School Musical) Ashley Benson (ABC Familys Pretty Little Liars) and former Justin Bieber squeeze Selena Gomez (Wizards of Waverly Place) -- plus Korines wife Rachel whos way out of her league in the sullied-teen-dream department. I dont know how the Mouse feels about the attendant hullaballoo -- maybe hes ripping mad maybe hes rubbing his white gloves together in glee at the prospect of a ratings boost for Pretty Little Liars and the coming The Wizards Return Alex vs. Alex. But Spring Breakers strikes me as another of Korines calculated punk outrages a sploog in Disneys direction. Its also among the perviest movies ever made -- although by spelling out why I fear Ill only make some people want to see it more. Spring Breakers opens with a montage of bouncing bare boobs and buttocks barely squeezed into bikini bottoms the camera gliding up the lengths of young girls thighs -- see what I mean? That skeevy guy down the street just grabbed his raincoat and headed for the multiplex. The point is that Korine isnt a passive voyeur. He moves in-in-in on those hot bods -- up down all around the town. A friend whispered ""The camera is like a giant tongue."" You can almost hear the slurping. But wait Korine is the festival darling who wrote Kids (they do drugs they get AIDS) and directed Julien Donkey-Boy featuring arthouse cinemas answer to Jar Jar Binks. Is Spring Breakers deliberately stupid and asinine a transgressive parody of Where the Boys Are that brazenly acknowledges what Korines admirers in the academy call the ""commodification of the female body""? Does he mean to have his cheesecake and deconstruct it too? Either way I think the movie is swill -- but I wouldnt be shocked if a whole crop of cinema studies papers affirms the case for its genius. After the wet-dreamy Girls Gone Wild prologue two college coeds ignore a history professors lecture on the struggle of African-Americans to exercise their liberty to focus on their own crusade for freedom -- succinctly expressed as ""I want penis."" But they must fight for their right to party -- or rather their funds to party. How can they take a bus to Florida and stay in a motel and buy booze and drugs when theyre broke? Easy peasy rob a diner. This they do in ski masks and short-shorts holding real-looking squirt guns. Satisfaction beckons ""All this money makes my pussy wet."" One of the four girls Faith (Gomez) does seem cut from a holier cloth. Shes first seen in a church group an ingenuous young Bible-clutching thing whos shot to show the stained-glass window above her. Korine flashes back to that image much later when shes throwing back vodkas amid writhing semi-naked teens. He wants to remind you of her higher self -- or to parody the Afterschool Specials that would remind you of her higher self. Or both. Its hard to tell. Outside her Sodom-like motel room Faith tells her grandmom on the phone that Florida is ""the most spiritual place Ive ever been"" and she means it She really is blissed out -- ""free as if the world is perfect."" Then theres a shot of the protagonists giggling in a pool during which the camera sinks below the water line for a good shot of their bottom halves. Spring Breakers switches gears midway through with the arrest of these bacchanalians (bikinis behind bars) and the arrival of James Franco as a flamboyant meth dealer with silver teeth and red-tinted cornrows. He watches them go before a judge and enraptured bails them out. ""Sprang break ... Sprang break ... "" he intones attempting to lull us with his sexy outlaw incantations. In his lavish manse he shows off his arsenal invokes Scarface and says ""This is the fuckin American dream yall."" Every one of Francos lines could be the prelude to a rap song too moronic for airplay. ""Sprang break ... Sprang break ... "" I wanted to spring-break his silver teeth but at least hes more committed here than in his other movie on screens now Oz the Great and Powerful -- a Disney production. By the time the movie segues into a bloody shoot-em-up with girls in bikinis firing automatic weapons it has lost its visceral kick -- its outright (and flaccid) camp. But even then the stars dont throw in the (beach) towel. Theyre pros. Ive suffered through enough Wizards of Waverly Place episodes with my daughters (along with a Wizards movie that is surprisingly not bad) to know that Gomez never condescends to her cartoon material. Benson has moments of bedraggled grace and Hudgens plays the dirtiest-minded girl with infectious glee. Still theres something overpoweringly creepy about the ways in which Korine goes about debasing his three leads all of whom are obviously there as a gesture of defiance -- an attempt to free themselves from their Mouse patriarch overlord and the shackles of corporate teen celebrity. Korine must have told them if they did Spring Breakers theyd be sticking it to the Man. Do they fully understand that the Man is now him and that for 90 minutes he and his protruding camera are sticking it to them?

Photo The four cuffed cuties in ""Spring Breakers"" are headed to jail for drugs. James Franco all is forgiven. He failed miserably (except at the box office last week) in the title role of ""Oz the Great and Powerful. But hes a hoot as a cornrowed rapper/drug dealer with metal teeth who bails out a quartet of high school girls from jail for his own nefarious reasons in ""Spring Breakers. If only whats misleadingly being marketed as the first mainstream film from aging enfant terrible Harmony Korine were half as entertaining as watching Franco channel his inner Matthew McConaughey. Yes there are four young women (including erstwhile Disney stars Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens) cavorting in Day-Glo bikinis for almost the entire 92-minute running time of this mock cautionary tale. Which feels like practically forever in whats basically a ""Girls Gone Wild short artily padded out to feature-length by endlessly repeating the same scenes and lines of dialogue often three or more times. ""Spring Breakers promises all sorts of titillation like girl-on-girl action but in truth youre not going to get much more action than youll find in the brilliantly cut trailer. Far more transgressive exploitation can be had by renting ""The Real Cancun a salacious documentary that went into wide release 10 years ago. But enough of the consumer warnings. Besides Franco the only actual acting going on here comes from Justin Biebers ex-girlfriend Gomez (""Wizards of Waverly Place). She plays Faith a religiously devout college student who begs off when the other three girls don ski masks to rob a convenience store with squirt guns to finance their spring-break trip. But Faith has no qualms about joining her slutty and fairly interchangeable friends Candy (Hudgens of the ""High School Musical franchise) Brit (Ashley Benson of ABCs ""Pretty Little Liars) and Cotty (Rachel Korine the writer-directors wife) for the trip to St. Petersburg Fla. The quartets hard partying in the sun-kissed land of beer bongs and topless women -- photographed to a fare-thee-well by French cinematographer Benoit Debie -- predictably lands the whiny foursome in jail on a drug rap. Theyre bailed out by Francos leering character -- he calls himself ""Alien -- who loads them into his convertible and installs the foursome in his sleazy beachfront crib replete with lots of guns cash and Scarface on an endless loop. Franco has a lot of fun with this character which he claims was inspired by a rapper named Dangeruss. One moment hes fellating a revolver as a form of (unconsummated) foreplay. Then he serenades the girls with Britney Spears ""Everytime while tinkling a piano on his outdoor terrace. But when Faith decides to take a bus home shortly afterward I was more than ready to join her. And even more so when Cotty decides to abruptly depart St. Pete after being accidentally wounded during an argument between Alien and one of his business rivals. The other two (Hudgens and Benson) are made of sterner stuff -- or more likely theyre just dumber. So theyre totally up for it when Alien invites them to don pink ski masks and pick up AK-47s while wearing bikinis (of course) to pay a little visit to the aforementioned business rival. ""Spring Breakers has been absurdly compared in some quarters to last springs Florida-set hit Steven Soderberghs ""Magic Mike. But Korine still disdains Soderberghs old-school interest in such niceties as developing characters you care about and a narrative that carries you along. Admittedly Im far from a fan of Korines ""Gummo ""Julien Donkey-Boy and the absymal ""Trash Humpers. But that he is proud of making intentionally sloppy and tedious movies doesnt make them any easier to watch. Or all that much fun for that matter.

But if thats your idea of fun -- party on Just be warned that along with all the tiny girls in tinier bikinis white lunkheads in cornrows and inevitable violence comes something else -- a migraine-inducing load of bad Art full of poetry pretense and blurry photography. Its like a Girls Gone Wild DVD -- shot by some failing freshman film student. Actually the film was made by Harmony Korine the wunderkind who wrote ""Kids"" at 22 and then quickly turned into the blunderkind of such unbearable experiments as ""Gummo"" and ""Julien Donkey-Boy."" By ""Trash Humpers"" there were probably more people making his films than watching them. But Korines 40 now and its time to sell out while somebodys still buying. So here comes ""Spring Breakers"" a movie which brings together two former Disney products as a couple of bored college students who along with two friends take a trip down to Florida and jump into a world of drug-fueled gun-toting criminals. Selena Gomez plays the nominal nice girl a born-again babyface named Im afraid Faith. At least she gets to show off her acting chops a little in one good emotional scene and -- smartly -- doesnt descend to some of the more embarrassing levels her co-stars do. Vanessa Hudgens however -- who currently has less of a career and more to prove -- pushes it further as the bad girl with peek-a-boo nudity and sexual threesomes. She definitely shows off a sly sleazy side although its hard to consider that any kind of breakthrough. Of course the path to adult roles is a tricky one and hardest on young actresses who have to navigate suddenly creepily precocious roles. If youre very lucky like Jodie Foster its in a great movie like ""Taxi Driver."" If youre moderately lucky like Anne Hathaway its in a bad movie nobody really sees like ""Havoc."" If youre unlucky -- well its this. The movie does get an unexpected jolt of life from James Franco always at his best playing slightly stupid lowlifes. Here hes Alien a trashy Southern gangsta rapper turning rapping gangster. Hes bizarre but at least hes watchable -- and much more believable than in things like ""Oz"" or the Oscars where hes trying to be charming. Korines movie though is completely charmless and mostly pointless -- mixing up film stocks needlessly repeating scenes and dialogue reversing time sequences and often padding out its paltry running time with leering shots of girls in scanty panties girls going topless girls on girls. Its the auteur as ogler. ""Bikinis and big booties yall"" Alien shouts at one point. ""Thats what life is about"" For some perhaps. But ""Spring Breakers"" is so over-the-top so-overdone so extreme itd turn even a hedonist off sex. And any sensible filmgoer off Harmony Korine whos gone from snotty young punk to dirty old man without ever growing up. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and constant nudity sexual situations and substance mostly by minors. Spring Breakers (R) A24 (94 min.) Directed by Harmony Korine. With Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens James Franco. Now playing in New York.",http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/03/spring_breakers_review_disney.html,200,springbreakers26,springbreakers,nj

Things perk up when James Franco appears about halfway through the movie sporting cornrows gold teeth and a dollar-sign neck tattoo.But when the focus is on various permutations of wild partying its a monotonous blur of beer bongs and bare breasts. Spring Breakers (  out of four; rated R; opening Friday in select cities) mucks about on the dark side of youthful revelry. But with director Harmony Korines visual overload and somnolent voice-overs -- the same sentences are repeated ad nauseum -- it manages to be both mind-numbingly dull and off-putting.The story skirts around a plot but what there is of it centers on a quartet of friends Faith (Selena Gomez) Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) will do almost anything to get to Florida and indulge in hedonistic rowdiness. They dont have the necessary funds so three of the girls (sans Faith) don ski masks and rob a diner. Wielding hammers and water pistols they terrorize employees and patrons and make off with a wad of cash. Though there was no visible hesitation on their parts one is heard exhorting her cohorts ""Just act like its a video game. Pretend youre in a movie.""MORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYDirector Korine whose divisive films include Kids might have given his actors the same counsel if they questioned his leering superficial and self-indulgent directorial style. Sure theres very little script non-existent character development and a host of shots simply trained on backsides and crotches but hey just pretend this is actually a movie. With a story. And characters anyone might remotely care about.The four girls are arrested for drug possession in the midst of their hearty partying. They spend a night in jail then are bailed out by the creepy Alien (Franco) who tells them ""Im made of money. Look at my teeth.""Hes an odd blend of gangsta and beach bum. ""Some people want to do the right thing"" he explains. ""I wanna do the wrong thing.""Three of the four girls are entranced. Faith -- whose name alludes to her religious inclinations -- gets a bad vibe and hops a bus for home. Her friends bid her a distracted farewell and go off to Aliens beachfront digs. At his house he shows off his extensive collection of firearms. He brags about all his possessions with the same zeal -- his collection of shorts his dark tanning oil and his hefty piles of cash.Its all enough to make you queasy -- equal parts disturbing and inanely incoherent -- but Franco digs into the role with an enthusiasm not evident in his portrayal of the title character in Oz the Great and Powerful. The films only moments of humor are courtesy of Franco and his distinctively loopy characterization. His violent tendencies match up with Candy and Cottys in a way that seems to bring him more ecstasy than their threesomes. .As it turns out the two girls are just as bad -- if not worse -- than Alien in a way that conjures up Natural Born Killers. Or maybe Bonnies and Clyde.What started out as an aimless portrait of debauchery shifts gears and becomes unremittingly amoral and bullet-riddled but only a jot less aimless. Its salacious but never provocative.Spring Breakers is aimed at fans of such cinematic virtuosity as Girls Gone Wild and the most violent video games. Girls in tiny bikinis carrying big guns.

"Review Spring Breakers revels in artful sleaze - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Spring Breakers revels in artful sleazeTV trio Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Benson are far from family fare as criminal college girls in Harmony Korines lewd and lush new film.March 14 2013|By Robert Abele James Franco stars in ""Spring Breakers."" (Michael Muller A24 )Florida in March is the vacation destination your mother warned you about. Which is one of the reasons Disney Channel sweethearts Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens were drawn to the candy-colored sleaze that is Harmony Korines ""Spring Breakers."" Its their chance with ABC Familys Ashley Benson (""Pretty Little Liars"") to break free of the parental-guidance considerations that have ruled their careers.Lewd lush and mind-emptying ""Spring Breakers"" mixes the commercial lure of its bikini-clad good girls turned bad with Korines brand of subculture excavation (""Gummo"" ""Trash Humpers""). The movie is an arty lark of ambiguous entertainment value pulsing with melancholy. Its rarely less than interesting visually or tonally thanks in large part to Korines prurient sense of humor and the rich location textures and Crayola sweep provided by gifted cinematographer Benoit Debie (""Enter the Void"").The threadbare story a rumbling like a bass line between the ambient images of bongs breasts and beat-driven boredom a involves money-strapped college girls (including Korines wife Rachel) who rob a diner with ski masks water pistols and mallets to fund their spring break road trip.PHOTOS SXSW 13 must-see filmsAfter landing in jail the quartet are bailed out by Alien a cornrowed multi-hyphenate (rapper/pusher/arms dealer) played with amusing Cheshire Cat skeeviness by the ubiquitous James Franco. He croons a Britney Spears song at his poolside baby grand while the group a minus Gomezs God-fearing character who wisely bails a plan further criminal adventures in the milky glow of youthful hedonism. This time with pink ski masks and real firepower.Is any of it sexy? Not especially. Is it violent? Plenty of TV shows are worse. Is it truthful? Well yes and no. Korine does manage the nifty respiratory trick of breathing in the intoxicating perfume of debauchery while exhaling a self-satisfied soullessness about it all. In the end its the strip club leer that hardens into a catatonic stare which in its way is commentary enough for a pop-exploitation riff like ""Spring Breakers.""calendarlatimes.com---Spring BreakersMPAA rating R for violence language and sexual contentRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesPlaying At the ArcLight Hollywood PHOTOS AND MORE TIMELINE Violence in movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOz to Spring Breakers James Franco says he likes to...March 26 2013Spring Breakers posts biggest limited-release debut of...March 17 2013Spring Breakers has virtues in its vices critics sayMarch 15 2013Young starlets take edgy trip with Spring BreakersSeptember 8 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentVanessa HudgensCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-spring-breakers-20130315,0,2525989.story",200,springbreakers28,springbreakers,latimes

So they come up with this fake concept of seeming to be dangerous when every move they make is the result of market research and a corporate master plan."" I found myself thinking a lot about MTV in ""Spring Breakers"" Harmony Korines laceration of American youth and its annual rites. The cable network probably went further than anyone to corporatize the age-old trek to the Florida coastline and as presented by Korine this bacchanal has become codified conformist and utterly repetitive. Are we having fun yet? A quartet of college girls (played by Disney Channel alums Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens ""Pretty Little Liars"" star Ashley Benson and directors wife Rachel Korine) are bored with their southern university its droning history lectures and its Christian fellowship meetings guided by bleached-blond biker clones. So the way kids do three of them hold up a restaurant (with squirt guns rubber mallets and ski masks) and use the proceeds to send all of them to Florida for spring break. Upon their arrival Korine gives us the shots we expect to see in a teensploitation movie on this subject bikini girls popping their tops and flipping off the camera Neanderthal thugs funneling booze a line of boys holding beer cans at crotch level and pouring the liquid into the mouths of reclining women. The tip-off that this isnt going to be an adolescent frolic is that these sequences are presented over and over again throughout the film turning these snapshots of wild partying into numbing abstract images. The more you watch the fun the less fun anyone seems to be having. But hey maybe ""Girls Gone Wild"" will be filming us One hotel party gets a little too wild and features a little too much cocaine and our heroines get sent to jail where they are soon bailed out by Alien (Franco) a white guy with dreadlocks a garish grill of metal teeth and a fixation on gangsta culture. (While showing the girls his many belongings -- future acting students will refer to this as the ""Look at my s--t"" monologue -- he boasts that he has ""Scarface On repeat"") Aliens mantra of ""Spring break ... spring break forever"" shows that brainless hedonism and behaving without consideration of consequence isnt limited to college kids and his lifestyle -- equally dangerous and ludicrous -- feels like the logical conclusion of the road the girls are on They preen and grind on each other for a leering camera that isnt there while he constantly acts like hes on an episode of either ""Cribs"" (MTV again) or ""Cops."" This stands among Francos finest work; his Alien is a character whos going to be imitated and quoted a great deal in years to come but he invests in this ludicrous creation riding a fine line between a lost soul and a caricature. The actresses also commit to their roles although Hudgens attempts to be a grown-up sexpot (both here and in the regrettable ""Sucker Punch"") pale next to her little-seen turn as a hilariously deadpan Daria type in ""Bandslam."" As for Korine -- this is a filmmaker whose work Ive found profoundly annoying over the years. (Yes I didnt see ""Trash Humpers"" but after enduring ""Gummo"" ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" and ""Mr. Lonely"" I gave myself a break.) His tendency to turn his subjects into freaks doesnt feel as irritating here mainly because spring break itself is already such a freakshow that theres little he can do but document it. He overdoes the ironic counterpoints (scenes of mayhem are narrated by innocuous phone calls home or by Britney Spears tunes) and foreshadowing (Hudgens spends way too much of the early part of the film shooting imaginary guns) but ""Spring Breakers"" is a tone poem of excess that can be read as blistering satire cautionary tale or even lament over the commodification of wildness. This aint ""Where the Boys Are"" but this wild and occasionally wearying road trip has other destinations in mind. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Spring Breakers beach-party fluff done as an art film by the reliably bizarre Harmony Korine is a return to form for Franco. As Alien a gun-crazy Florida drug dealer with tats beaded cornrows and a grill any rapper would envy Franco is a bug-fuck blast. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Too bad the movie itself is rarely as outrageous as he is. The promise of nudity and girl-on-girl action among Disney hotties Vanessa Hudgens (High School Musical) Selena Gomez (Wizards of Waverly Place) and Ashley Benson (Pretty Little Liars) is just a porny tease. Candy (Hudgens) Brit (Benson) Faith (Gomez) and Cotty (Rachel Korine the directors wife) are merely college BFFs yearning for a spring break. Everyone but Faith (shes into Christian studies) agrees to rob a local chicken shack to finance a Tampa getaway. Heres your chance to hear the chirpy Hudgens say ""Give me your motherfucking money or Im going to shoot your fucking brains out."" And theyre off. Alien laps them right up. At his crib where bongs and blow are plentiful and Al Pacinos Scarface plays on a continuous loop the coeds live the dream. Violence looms in the form of Archie (Gucci Mane) Aliens gangsta enemy. No sweat. When Alien isnt going down on a gun barrel in a homoerotic domination game he sits at his poolside piano and croons Britney Spears ballads to the girls who wear pink ski masks and dance around waving AK-47s. Faith is the first one to take the bus home. You may want to follow before the exasperating Korine of Gummo Julien Donkey-Boy and Trash Humpers starts letting dialogue repeat itself across a throbbing soundscape from Cliff Martinez (Drive) and Skrillex. If the reverb doesnt get you the images will especially a bloody climactic gun battle. Benoit Debie the camera master who shot Irreversible washes the screen with lurid color that turns your eyes into pinwheels. The actors cant compete with the kinky trippy visuals - except Franco who surfs Korines wavelength and doesnt wipe out. No small feat given Korines masturbatory self-regard. Francos sleazoid tour de force is no match for 127 Hours or even Pineapple Express. But this dude can hold the screen.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 14 2013 159 PM Title Spring Breakers Film Info R Violence nudity sexuality language. Empire 25 Union Square. Theres appeal to movies about innocence being lost as long as we discover something new along the way. So what do we find out in ""Spring Breakers"" a film that wants to blur together young Americas appetite for sex violence and abandoning all hope? Not much. But that doesnt mean this Day-Glo bacchanalia has nothing to say. In fact for its first hour through a not-very-subtle sense of slow-motion self-destruction the film pinpoints the aggression behind its vapid characters embrace of stripper psyche and trash culture. These are not people youd want to meet in a dark alley so dont be fooled just because theyre pretty young things in bikinis. Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) are bored collegiates at an unnamed vaguely Christian Southern college. They hear the siren song of spring break and they bring along the slightly reluctant Faith (Selena Gomez) whose brunette-framed baby face belies her hunger for adventure. Faith is warned Candy and Cotty are trouble but thats part of their appeal. The girls have a fraction of the money they need to head down to Floridas beaches -- and the promise they hold of bodies booze and boys -- so they randomly decide to don masks and rob a restaurant using hammers and water pistols. The fury they exhibit captured in a hypnotic sequence from the viewpoint of the girl in the getaway car (the three blond actresses are deliberately indistinct often moving as one hugging cooing mass) is an omen of what awaits them in St. Petersburg. Not long after arriving theyre jailed on a drug charge and bailed out by a creepy criminal-rapper called Alien (James Franco). Like an evil genie released from a dirty bong the silver-toothed dreadlocked Alien takes the girls to the dark side. Two girls eventually hop a bus home but the others happily become Aliens lovers and molls for an attack on a rival. James Franco plays a criminal-rapper named Alien in Spring Breakers. (Michael Muller) That onslaught which has an interminable buildup yet no punch turns ""Spring Breakers"" common. But  writer-director Harmony Korine (""Gummo"") an acquired taste manages to make much of the film into a ""Natural Born Killers""-style pop patchwork with a ""Grand Theft Auto"" lack of morality. Never fully with its heroines but far from scolding theres social commentary here almost in spite of Korines brash efforts to resist it. The actresses are never more than hot bodies with guns though Gomez gives Faiths journey resonance. The others are overshadowed not only by the movies attitude and gritty-gorgeous cinematography but by Franco. So often not in his element -- his turn in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is evidence of that -- Franco is in freako mode here and walks a line between spaced-out caricature and just plain Out There. With Aliens drawling ""Yalls"" and his hair-trigger sensitivity Francos the biggest gamble in the eager-to-shock ""Spring Breakers"" helping to make the trip pay off.

Share Tweet The diabolical genius of Harmony Korine is that his films are so cloistered by self-consciousness and movie-movie artifice that all criticisms leveled against them are subject to the Pee-wee Herman Effect ""I meant to do that."" Think Gummo is an unseemly mix of poetry and exploitation? ""I meant to do that."" Balk at Trash Humpers total disregard for composition depth and meaningful connection between one scene and the next? ""I meant to do that."" Find Korines new film Spring Breakers a vacuous repetitive hyperbolically stupid fusion of Girls Gone Wild Scarface and that lesson-filled after-school special where Helen Hunt snorts crank and jumps out a window? Of course Thats what so great about it Surrendering to the Korine paradox has never been more tempting than it is with Spring Breakers which is lush and exuberant and gives his admittedly brilliant eye its fullest expression to date. And yet the inanity of it lingers when the sensation starts to dull. True to the Korine spirit of calculated scandal Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens molt the remainder of their squeaky-clean Disney image as two in a quartet of friends (Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine are the others) determined to head from Nowheresville U.S.A. to Florida for spring break. Lacking the necessary funds three of them cajole good girl Gomez into knocking off a diner with squirt guns and sledgehammers and they hightail it down the freeway with their ill-gotten cash. Florida turns out to be every bit the end-of-the-world bacchanal they dreamed it would be but the cops inevitably round them up and throw them in jail. They find a surprise benefactor in James Franco a blinged-out gangsta who bails them out and proceeds to get them into deeper trouble. Resembling a cross between Kevin Federline and Willem Dafoes sinister cretin in Wild At Heart Franco masters the weird semi-improvisational babble that constitutes dialogue in a Harmony Korine film projecting colorful idiocy and seductive menace in equal measure. (Cinema historians will want to file his ""Look at my shit"" monologue in the pantheon alongside Henry Fondas ""Ill be there"" speech in The Grapes Of Wrath.) The sensual overload of Korines Day-Glo images of bodies in motion underlined by the sonic assault of Skrillexs score makes Spring Breakers seem transcendent in five-minute bursts. But the overall effect is enervating like a party that grinds on after most of the attendees have either left or passed out. And much like Kids the enfant terribles breakthrough screenplay Korines film has an unintended moral hysteria like a warning to parents of what their good girls are doing when they arent looking. The message Keep them locked up. In their bikinis if necessary.

(In this reading Nick Carraway the narrator-observer-survivor character in ""Gatsby"" is played by a quartet of bikini babes.) In case you think Im making this up ""Spring Breakers"" even features an illuminated dock extending into Tampa Bay that represents the fulfillment of the Franco characters desires in this case not a reunion with an old flame but the murder of an old friend.Where my theory falls apart perhaps is on the presumption that ""Spring Breakers"" writer-director Harmony Korine has actually read ""The Great Gatsby"" or is capable of and/or interested in emulating a literary model. Still Fitzgeralds influence could have crept in there by osmosis and whatever other charges you want to level against ""Spring Breakers"" - such as incoherence plotlessness salaciousness and mind-numbing monotony - it has no lack of high concept. Its partly a softcore ""Girls Gone Wild"" spring-break special featuring formerly wholesome teen-oriented stars Selena Gomez Ashley Benson and Vanessa Hudgens; partly an early-2000s episode of ""Cops""; partly a deranged expressionistic crime fantasy; partly a near-abstract study in Florida beachfront light shot by ace French cinematographer Benoit Debie; and partly a work of James Franco performance art.Does all this colorful and ecstatic mess add up to a movie? I mean tastes vary and all that but basically the answer is no. There are beautiful things hilarious things and terrifying things in ""Spring Breakers"" and sometimes all three at once. Theres no question that Korine - once the wunderkind screenwriter of Larry Clarks ""Kids"" and then the director of much-debated film-festival faves like ""Gummo"" ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" and ""Trash Humpers"" - is reaching for an unusual art-trash fusion here. Theres a moment of consummation late in the film when I felt hed gotten there An idiotic but mystical union of sex and death; the writhing naked beer-bonging bodies of spring break on St. Pete Beach as damned souls in an American reworking of Hieronymus Bosch.Maybe the picturesque repetitious and largely non-narrative tedium that constitutes most of ""Spring Breakers"" gets us to that moment through some kind of hypnosis. And maybe Korine is just throwing ideas and images at the wall to see what sticks or maybe he keeps repeating shots and snippets of dialogue over and over (and over) again because he and Debie didnt shoot enough footage to tell a story with any semblance of forward momentum. ""Spring Breakers"" raises once again the problem found in all of Korines movies but most especially in ""Trash Humpers"" which purported to be a found-footage VHS tape documenting the misadventures of back-alley Nashville degenerates. Is making something that is pointless and incoherent as an aesthetic choice somehow superior to doing so because you dont know better? In practice is there any difference?Anyway So theres this quartet of bored college girls somewhere in America played by ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" star Gomez ""Pretty Little Liars"" star Benson ""High School Musical"" star Hudgens and Rachel Korine who is the directors wife. Confusingly these young ladies appear to already be in Florida or not far away just going by the palm trees and flat sandy ground of their campus - but maybe thats a ""postmodern utterance"" as the theory-damaged types who are already proclaiming this movie a masterpiece might say. Theyre all archetypes rather than characters and other than Gomezs religious good girl Faith - who doesnt stay in the story all that long - none is readily distinguishable from the others. Which may be the point I guess yada yada. You Might Also Like Lacking the scratch to make it to Florida for spring break the girls stage a vicious diner robbery - urging each other to ""pretend its a video game"" - and then hop a bus for St. Petersburg where they have a series of highly predictable sex drug and booze adventures before ending up in jail. Korine filmed these episodes documentary-style amid the banal anonymous debauchery of a real spring-break week contrasting the pornographic frat-party atmosphere with the girls repeated phone calls home which are full of assurances that theyre finding themselves and finding kindred spirits in a transformational paradise.I dont so much mind Korine making the point that these American everygirls live in such a constricted imaginative universe that their ideas of personal liberation are fundamentally moronic and that they respond to rapper-hustler Alien (Franco) with his beach house guns bling and framed ""Scarface"" photos as a manifestation of the American dream. But I do mind the Pounding Hammer of Obviousness heard throughout the film as with the cracka-chacka sound of a handgun being loaded and cocked which is used between every single scene. Hedonism comes with a price and the party lifestyle comes with a dark side. We get it Harmony Enough with the hipster after-school special mode.As for James Franco he very nearly makes up for his dull and uneasy leading role in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" with Alien (real name Al ""but Im from another planet yall"") a thoroughly offensive and outrageous character who is so ridiculous hes almost believable. Reportedly based on a real-life Florida rapper named Dangeruss Alien is like a human embodiment of everything thats toxic about American pop culture - up to and including those silly shorts that are almost but not quite as long as pants - and as such is also charming and irresistible. Im not sure which of Francos scenes is most disgusting and great The one where the girls force him to fellate his own guns and he likes it or the beachfront piano rendition of Britney Spears ""Everytime"" complete with an interpretive dance number involving pink unicorn ski masks. But heres the thing With all this effusive description Im making it sound as if watching ""Spring Breakers"" is actually an enjoyable experience when the actual movie - which may involve 25 minutes of actual footage endlessly reiterated until it reaches feature length - will bore and frustrate a lot more viewers than it delights. I cant resist quoting an enthusiastic Swedish commentator on IMDB who has described ""Spring Breakers"" as ""radical poetic hyper-cinema"" that lies ""beyond the postmodern dichotomy of good/bad or high/low"" and as a ""hyper-simulacrum that reflects contemporary culture in an extremely complex manner."" Honestly thats about 38 percent true. But it doesnt sound super-fun right? Its an elaborate way of saying that if youre too uncool to dig the intentionally trashy and heavy-handed emptiness of this movie youre even dumber than its characters.""Spring Breakers"" opens this week at the Regal Union Square in New York and the ArcLight Hollywood in Los Angeles with wider national release to begin March 22.

Slideshow 18 Spring Break Movies to Watch If Youre Not Going on Spring Break All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun"" goes Jean-Luc Godards quip. Add to that a few more girls and their bikinis and you have the rough formula for Harmony Korines Spring Breakers which looks like the most expensive Girls Gone Wild video ever made and feels like a grindhouse version of a 1950s beach-party movie Where the Boys Are Pimps and Gangstas. Or Gidget Goes to Hell. As in the best work by Korine--the agile agent provocateur whose credits include the screenplay for Kids and most recently the shot-on-VHS vagabond vaudeville Trash Humpers--it is impossible to say where exploitation ends and deconstruction begins. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The setting of Spring Breakers is the Florida coast where several centuries of explorers--from Ponce de Leon to 2 Live Crew--have come seeking the fount of eternal youth and where huddled masses of frostbitten coeds migrate at the end of each winter in pursuit of sun sex and their own quasi-immortality. Korine shows from the start that hes fully plugged into spring breaks mythic dimension opening the film with a long slo-mo montage of crotch grabbing ass shaking beer-soaked boob jiggling and lips doing the most indecent things to Popsicles all framed against the glittering Gulf of Mexico. Its shot in anamorphic widescreen and retina-burning fluorescent colors courtesy of the French cinematographer Benoit Debie a veteran collaborator of Gaspar Noe. Korine turns the sequence into a Boschian invitation to decadence a sun-soaked postcard from Caligulas Rome.What were seeing may be the fantasy of four undergraduate friends--Brit Faith Candy and Cotty--jonesing for a primal escape. In a casting coup the girls are played by Disney and Teen People princesses--erstwhile Zac Efron and Justin Bieber paramours Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez along with Pretty Little Liars star Ashley Benson--who dont so much toy with their good-girl images as set them ablaze. (Theyre joined by Korines real-life wife Rachel who has no such reputation to implode.) Never mind who plays whom loss of identity among the gyrating spring-break mass being one of the movies dominant themes. These Cinderellas all dream of the Florida ball (or given the lewd drawings we see two of them making in their history-class notebooks balls) but a cash-flow problem threatens to leave them stranded on campus. So with little compunction they decide to hold up a local diner with squirt guns and ski masks and a Godardian resolve to transform life into cinema ""Just fuckin pretend its a video game. Act like youre in a movie or something."" What follows is nothing if not bravura moviemaking--a robbery filmed in one continuous take from the p.o.v. of the getaway car as it circles the outside of the building.Film Details Spring Breakers RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time94 More Info Trailer The newly flush quartet then hightail it to St. Petersburg Beach where they meet-cute the aptly named Alien a corn-rowed elaborately tattooed hip-hop star with a sideline in drug and arms dealing and a mouth full of silver teeth that glisten like a werewolfs. Alien is played by James Franco who is at first unrecognizable. Franco is said to have modeled his portrayal on the real underground Florida rapper Dangeruss (a/k/a Russ Curry) and while one doubts Spring Breakers will provoke any Argo-like debates over how accurately art imitates life theres no question that Alien represents the apotheosis of Francos hydra-headed career as matinee idol doctoral candidate soap star and gallery artist. Its a full-blown Method performance (with an emphasis on ""meth"") that can also be seen as a knowing lampoon of Method acting. In any case its a consistent astonishment. Franco and Korine are so suited to collaboration its amazing it didnt happen sooner--two prankster artists whose straight-faced self-parody can skirt the sublime. You leave the theater with Aliens growling mantra ""spring break forevah"" echoing in your head like a cantata.Heralded as Korines most conventional accessible film (mainly because of its cast) Spring Breakers may in fact be his most experimental. Particularly in the final third working with the editor Douglas Crise (Babel) he achieves something close to a sustained psychotropic state. Time splinters into a subjective chronology of flashbacks and foreshadowing all set to a driving electronic-dance-music soundtrack by composer Cliff Martinez (who previously created the retro-electronica score for Drive) and EDM guru Skrillex. Punctuating the trance are vignettes that could have sprung from no other artistic consciousness a pool-hall of perdition where Korine mingles his cast with some of St. Petes real Bukowskian locals; the girls falling-down-drunk parking-lot rendition of Britney Spearss "". . . Baby One More Time""; and the piece de resistance Francos piano-ballad cover of Spearss ""Everytime"" delivered with startling sincerity. At such moments Spring Breakers seems to be holding a funhouse mirror up to the face of youth-driven pop culture leaving us uncertain whether to laugh recoil in horror or marvel at its strange beauty. All I knew is I couldnt wait to see it a second time.Slideshow 18 Spring Break Movies to Watch If Youre Not Going on Spring BreakFollow VoiceFilmClub 2 Slideshow 18 Spring Break Movies to Watch If Youre Not Going on Spring Break Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Scott Foundas Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

If you favor your sleaze with a fillip of arty self-awareness these might be the best of times. Never one to be outdone in such things Harmony Korine hoists his bong and beer funnel high in Spring Breakers a full-bodied (and bare-bodied) paean to lurid debauchery. The former enfant terrible still most famous for scripting Kids (1995) at age 18 and moving on to Gummo (1997) says he never went south to experience a spring break personally. The good news is hes made up for it in spectacular fashion Right from the start were immersed in slo-mo beach jiggle and the pounding squelch-dance of Skrillex (the soundtrack also by frequent Soderbergh collaborator Cliff Martinez creates a humidity of its own). So fully does Spring Breakers mount an atmosphere of swirling arms blithe female availability and lubricated torsos you can almost smell the sex stink. All of this should equal a gold mine for a certain kind of audience but Korine--like his onetime mentor Larry Clark--has a brass-ring-grabbing instinct that pushes his salaciousness into capital letters. Hes going for a tongue-in-cheek Statement About Our Lost Youth and the pretension is so obvious you want to hug him for it. First were in a near-parody of a mediocre college where Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) Brit (Ashley Benson) Cotty (Rachel Korine the directors game wife) and goody-two-shoes Faith (Selena Gomez never required to shed her squareness) take to their dorm hallways in flouncing displays of bare-legged gymnastics. Korine lays the bored young women out on a disgusting bathroom floor counting their cash and dreaming of escape. The more lawless of the quartet get high and rob a chicken shack (Korine ever the professor emphasizes the line ""Act like youre in a video game or something""). Already swollen with girl-on-girl flirtation criminal fantasy and naive dreaminess the movie explodes into Tampa Bay-set skankitude where our leads are never out of bikinis even when flung in jail for trashing a hotel room. Theyre bailed out by Alien (James Franco more alive than ever in the films only actual performance) a cornrowed heavily armed wanksta rapper who nakedly desires them for his posse. It all plays out in a final flourish of DayGlo Scarface wish fulfillment and you cant really believe what youre watching. Alien--and Korine--tell us its the American dream come true and even if you resist going there with them the have-your-cake-and-fling-it-too stupidity is breathtaking. It takes some kind of cracked artistry to put coeds in hot-pink ski masks and have them twirl around to a Britney Spears ballad toting machine guns. Spring Breakers is either an inspired satire of the youth movie or the most irresponsible comedy mainstream Hollywood will never make. The bros in your crowd will call it rad--and radical it is.

TWITTER James Franco Selena Gomez Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Benson and Rachel Korine hit the beach and the bong in Florida in eternal maverick Harmony Korines latest. VENICE - Even by the elastic measure of James Francos unpredictable career the actor gives one of his more bizarre performances in Harmony Korines Spring Breakers. Playing a Florida white-trash gangsta with beaded cornrows and a gleaming mouthful of metal hes a cross between Bo Derek in 10 and Richard Kiel in Moonraker. At one point he sits poolside at a cheesy white grand piano and sings a Britney Spears ballad while three co-eds in DTF pants and pink ski masks do an impromptu dance routine with AK-47s. Sounds good? Well like the film as a whole Francos borderline parodistic performance is interesting only up to a point. It may be one of Korines more conventional narratives but this is basically a porn-pulp snort of derision at the American Dream and the youthful search for self packaged as Beach Blanket Bingo on acid. It has hypnotic visual style and a dense driving soundscape. But its also too monotonous and thematically empty to be seriously provocative. PHOTOS Venice Film Festival Days 4 Through 6 The Master Love Is All You Need Premiere Gallery More than by Franco the films profile will be boosted by the presence of former Disney Channel cuties Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens among all the bong-hitting boozing coke-snorting breast-baring grinding bodies. ""Poetry in motion"" is how Francos drug-dealing rapper Alien describes the crowd at a beach beer blast. ""Bikinis and big booties yall. Thats what life is about."" Gomez plays the pointedly named Faith a Christian youth group member who has somehow remained close to three reprobate skanks she has known since kindergarten Candy (Hudgens) Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine the writer-directors wife). Cotty has pink highlights and a sullen streak while interchangeable Candy and Brit are defined only by their slutty blondeness. Desperate to get out of their dull college town but short on cash the bad girls wield fake guns and hammers to hold up a Chicken Shack terrorizing the customers and later torching the stolen car they used. The adrenaline rush they get from this taste of violent crime hints at whats to come. Even before they hit Florida the action time-shuffles Girls Gone Wild/MTV-style montages of hard-partying college kids in various stages of inebriation and undress. Faith seems unsettled when her pals re-enact the robbery for her but she nonetheless partakes of the proceeds as the four girls cruise around town on rented scooters. Here and throughout voiceover is featured heavily much of it vapid stuff about wanting all this to last forever. Korine and editor Douglas Crise use repetition in the images and dialogue to obsessive effect. Cinematographer Benoit Debies visuals with their sun-blasted exteriors pink skies neon splashes and candy color washes have a cool allure. And the electronic score by Cliff Martinez and dubstep musician Skrillex that saturates every scene (along with a sprinkling of chart hits) is no less propulsive than Martinezs music was in Drive or Contagion. But theres a nagging sense that a sliver of substance has been pumped full of growth hormones in post. When the girls are arrested during a bust at a druggy party they are hauled in their bikini tops and cutoffs before a judge who orders them to pay a fine or spend another night in the lockup. ""This wasnt supposed to happen"" says Faith in whispery voiceover. ""This cant be the end of the dream."" In fact its the beginning of the dream as Korine steers things in a more hallucinogenic direction. Alien covers the babes bail and while they question his motives they climb aboard his pimped-out sports car with BALL-R plates and dollar-sign hubcaps. A dim bulb with lots of swagger he paints a self-glorifying picture of himself flashing wads of cash and an arsenal of weaponry. In one of many instances of Korine having fun with metatextual cine-references Aliens flat screen plays Scarface on a loop. Faith becomes uncomfortable at his sleazy crib. After a tense exchange in which he comes on strong - nicely played by Gomez - she extricates herself from the situation and takes the bus home. Alien insists on the other girls remaining which signals their endangerment. But it turns out they can more than hold their own. Like ducks to water they slip into his crime crew provide girl-on-girl entertainment and flip sexual domination roles with the receptive Alien. It soon becomes apparent that he has nothing on these girls in terms of their appetite for excess and amorality. Cotty takes off after being wounded by a bullet from Aliens turf rival Archie (Gucci Mane) and Candy and Brit lead the charge as they strike back. That they do this in matching fluoro-yellow bikinis underlines that the bacchanal is primarily a pop-art exercise - a sour lollipop that loses its flavor. However its intended the attitudinal posing curbs any capacity to shock. From the minute Alien steps in the film becomes like a more extreme version of one of those Saturday Night Live video sketches with Justin Timberlake and Andy Samberg flaunting exaggerated hip-hop style. And while Hudgens and Benson evince a persuasive embrace of bad-assery these psychosexual bunnies have little to do beyond look hot and occasionally fellate a popsicle. Gomezs character is given a tad more dimension before she exits and is promptly forgotten but all the characters are thinner than an Olsen twin. The setting and aspects of the aesthetic will attract comparison to this summers Magic Mike. But while Korine douses the air with dreamy melancholia Steven Soderberghs film came by its underlying sense of emptiness and restless longing far more naturally. That said Spring Breakers seems bound to acquire at least minor cult status.

""A girl should be two things who and what she wants."" - Coco Chanel ""Btches aint sht but hoes and tricks."" - Dr. Dre. Years ago I saw a cartoon in an alt weekly thats stuck with me. A performance artist is doing something absurd. Someone shouts something to the tune of ""you cant hide your lack of creativity by intentionally acting dumb."" The artist cheerfully fires back ""all response is valid"" Its a cant-lose proposition and thats what Harmony Korine has on his hands with his brilliant/putrid satire/pornography. Its shallow its boring its poignant its clever its poorly acted its intentionally poorly acted it has no story it has marvelous scenes it is artful it is hallucinatory it is shoddily put together. All response is valid. ""Spring Breakers"" is the story of four nearly nude nubile girls bored with their deadbeat college so they rob a diner to pay for a trip to Florida. Once there they get high and get laid (which is kinda what they were doing up at school) but now they do it on the beach. The cheap hedonism is an epiphany for them and it gives them a purpose in life. It would be easy to dismiss ""Spring Breakers."" Lord Id like to. Anything that exploits women this ruthlessly begs to be dismissed. (And sorry Disney Girls Selena Gomez Ashley Benson and Vanessa Hudgens you may think this is your ticket to an adult career but this isnt ""Ruby in Paradise"" and none of you are Ashley Judd.) Unfortunately there are moments somewhere in the cannabis haze of day-glo bikini buttocks and cocaine-topped nipples where an abstract expressionism starts to seep off the screen. The swirl of horny jocks skanky girls and inadvisable behavior mixed with booze bongs bling and ridiculous signifiers like wiggers and bronys all starts to become. . .beautiful. Luckily for Korines sake nothing in this tale of three bad girls and their one wayward Christian friend on a crime and promiscuity bender is meant to be taken literally or all that seriously. At times the jokes are obvious - like an appearance before the bench in quite skimpy bikinis. How youll take some of the other flourishes like the fact that most of the girls dialogue simply describes the action that just happened or the endlessly repeating vague platitudes (a technique also seen in Korines ""Trash Humpers"" and ""The Fourth Dimension"") will be entirely up to the viewer. Also Check Out Stars Take the Red Carpet at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival ""Spring Breakers"" is the type of movie where you wonder when its actually going to kick in and start then you check your watch and see it is nearly over. The first third of the movie is just a curvy rear-end of bad behavior shaken in your face. Then the girls get busted. (They spend a lot of time with dozens of hot young boys and girls writhing and destroying hotel rooms.) They are bailed out by James Franco an absurdly cornrowed gangsta with platinum teeth. ""Look at my sht"" is his mantra as he excites the girls with his conspicuous consumption. It is a wonderful dreamy monologue the inner voice of a grunting illiterate barbarian. Twice on the soundtrack we hear Gomezs call home to her grandmother. ""We found ourselves here. Its so beautiful."" The juxtaposed images the first time are of lewd prurience and it is up to you to decide if this is to be tskked or accepted as just ""kids having fun."" The second time however the adventures have turned more dark more surreal and more violent. By the end our spring breakers are wearing pink ski masks and gunning down drug kingpins in a blood ballet. The big question is if this is art or if this is b.s. I guess Im an easy mark cause Im inclined to call it art. Some of the sequences with evocative music by Cliff Martinez and Skrillex really work. Other times however it fails and fails hard. The acting is quite poor. Korine may be nuts but I dont think he intentionally asked for bad performances. Also the shtick of repetitive dialogue sometimes feels like he only shot a few lines from different angles and decided he needed to use all of them to pad this flick out to 90 minutes. Gomez character just up-and-disappears and I swear to you I would not be surprised if it was because the actress only had a few days for ""Spring Breakers"" and had a prior commitment. The films scenario (I wont even call it a script) is so free-form that changes like this dont really matter. ""Act like you are in a movie or something"" the girls tell one another. The odd thing is for a picture like this one whose purpose I believe is to be critical of our consumptive culture a film thats eating itself is kinda perfect. All response is valid.

""Thats what life is about."" At least during the months-long rite of passion known as spring break. Needing little urging from the gentlemen on Floridas Gulf Coast young women booze on the beach merrily expose their siliconed breasts and fellate red-white-and-blue lollipops all to fulfill the hedonistic edicts of Girls Gone Wild videos and MTV. They act silly; you can watch. Three college girls stuck at school and short on cash simply must be in Tampa so they don ski masks and rap-master gestures and rob the patrons of a Chicken Shack. ""Dont be scared"" the girls tell themselves before the big heist. ""Pretend its a f--in video game. Pretend youre in a movie."" (MORE TIMEs Cannes review of Kids) Harmony Korines Spring Breakers operates under two pretenses that its a more extreme version of spring-break movies that stretch back at least a half-century to the sedate dating of the 1960 Where the Boys Are; and that its a satire of the whole genre -- indeed of the American dream of sex drugs rock n roll and eternal nubility. But the movie the most accessible in the oeuvre of the 39-year-old who really was an enfant terrible when he wrote the script for Larry Clarks teen-AIDS outrage Kids back in the early 90s has too much fun exploiting the milieu it may mean to be mocking. Its a canny mixture of satire and sell-out if theres even any difference between the two in a movie age where excess and irony have become incestuous twins. Selena Gomez plays the pointedly named Faith part of a Christian sect and friend of the girls who pulled the robbery. Shes known them for years she tells her skeptical evangelical cohorts; theyre good people. The Christians were right these girls are the demon spawn ready to party their way into jail once they get to Tampa. There they are bailed out by Alien who takes them on as his posse in a turf battle with archrival Archie (rapper Gucci Mane). Faith sees the light and heads for home; another girl takes a bullet; and the remaining pair turn out to be gunslingers of the most violent order. Say this for the writer-director he scored three artistic coups none of them having much to do with whats on screen. He signed Franco the workaholic Oscar nominee and (catastrophic) Oscar host to play the gangsta drugsta Alien. He corralled three young graduates of well-scrubbed TV shows -- Selena Gomez from the Disney Channels Wizards of Waverly Place Vanessa Hudgens of Disneys High School Musical films and Ashley Benson of the ABC Family Channels Pretty Little Liars -- to dance around in skimpies and two of them to mime smoking dope and lesbonic kissing. And he persuaded the programmers of the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals to play Spring Breakers alongside new films by Terrence Malick and Paul Thomas Anderson. (READ Richard Corlisss review of The Iceman with James Franco) Why would that be? Could it be that august institution the international film festival will take any movie if its cast includes a teen-dream star? At Cannes this year High School Musicals Zac Efron and The Twilight Sagas Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson (separately) showed up to promote their films in the competition. Efron was at Venice with At Any Price. And on Wednesday Gomez sporting neither her purity ring nor her sometime beau Justin Bieber was seen taking a water-taxi speedboat across the waters that separate Venice from the Lido where the festival takes place. The paparazzi took shots sent round the world and the question of selling out became larger and murkier. Not that a pop-art junk movie like Spring Breakers shouldnt get some festival exposure as an aid to securing theatrical release. The movie does reveal an actual artist at work French cinematographer Benoit Debie who filmed Gaspar Noes truly transgressive Irreversible and Enter the Void. Saturating the images with a neon tinge and supervising a sensational reverse-crane shot of revelers by the hundreds at a pool party Debie gives Spring Breakers a great look even if the movies mind is pretty much wasted. Destructive kids with wasted minds was the subject of Korines last effort the suicidal-career movie Trash Humpers which The Village Voices J. Hoberman described as ""a spectacle to be watched in a wino stupor"" (and he meant that as a compliment). This 2009 movie showed young renegades in old-people masks doing rude things including purporting to have sex with trash bin to live out their motto to ""Make it make it dont fake it."" Trash Humpers at least had the artistic courage of its own lunatic convictions but Spring Breakers is all surface and sham; its trash about humpers. (Venice Film Festival Follow TIMEs Complete 2012 Coverage) The gangster and humpster-in-chief here is Franco bringing an insane intoxicating level of commitment to the role of Alien (real name Al). Sporting elaborate cornrows and front teeth studded with more grillwork than a 58 Plymouth Franco is a man in love with his stuff his gun-bedecked walls his bed ""thats an art-piece"" his constantly running loop of the 1983 Florida crime classic Scarface. (Maybe he never got to the end of the movie.) When Alien sits at his grand piano and plays Britney Spears ""Everytime"" as the girls cavort in pink ski masks Spring Breakers nearly achieves the sense of delirium it wants to instill in its gawkers. This pretense of a movie finally becomes one.
