When married commuter Charles (Clive Owen) embarks on an illicit affair with the mysterious Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston) trouble follows in the shape of violent thief Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel) who uses his knowledge of their union to blackmail Charles. Naturally Charles has a sickly child who needs a costly live-saving operation guess where his savings are going?Until the action kicks in this is vaguely engaging the couples flirtation involves and the character of Lucinda intrigues. But the increasingly preposterous plot starts to take on a life of its own morphing into the sort of twist-addled trash usually reserved for cheap TV thrillers. While Aniston and Owen retain a surprising amount of dignity Cassel lays on the dastardly villain act a bit thick (much as he did in Oceans Twelve). There are some dark laughs as foolish Charles gets in way over his head but like the glaring twist signals its hard to tell how intentional they are.

I did not guess the twist although many say it was obvious. I expected a feel good Saturday morning film which does not requiring little or no thought. I usually enjoy AnistonaEUR(tm)s genius comedic timing and dismay at what appears to be an endless supply of films well below the ability and talent she clearly has. I can understand why she is repeatedly cast in comedies as stated previously her comedic timing is an asset to any film. She also has an undoubted appeal to the public but I often question WHY does she not pick better scripts? Perhaps she is not offered them if that is the case her agent needs to put some work in and earn his/her commission. Derailed was a definite deviation from the norm for her and I found certain scenes shocking and violent evoking genuine sympathy for the characters who. Due to this I was initially able to pass off as bland the clichA(c)d life OwensaEUR(tm) character led. I found the speed of both characters demise dubious but initially assumed this was due to them both being forced to dive into a world that could not have been further from the lives the world thought they were leading. It may have been an editorial time saving tool but the choices of Clive Owens character in particular were possibly supposed to be the actions of a desperate man but they were unbelievable even accounting for the lengths some will go to cover up lies and deception. Its my belief that he would not have resorted to such unlawful ways to escape his nightmare situation. Even a man desperate to protect his wife and sick child from the reality of his stupid mistake I find it unlikely a successful professional would not have acted to prevent the situation descending to the life changing depths it did so rapidly even allowing for poetic licence we would expect an attempt to take charge of the situation. Perhaps this a deliberate tool to demonstrate the power and lure of Anistons character and his willingness to protect her forsaking the manner he would normally acted in. The end was almost unbearable as I was struck by what I can only assume was a poor/weak attempt to wind the film up ensuring there were no loose ends. Id have preferred a few questions left unanswered than the amateur almost audible checklist we were subjected to with the absolute worst and totally unbelievable few lines regarding the contents of the hotelaEUR(tm)s safe I shall not spoil the surprise for anyone who has not seen the film. Despite the flaws I have perhaps been a bit harsh in highlighting I thought Aniston in particular played a fantastic part and it was an inspired piece of casting. It may well have been because it was so far removed from her normal rolls that the shocking nature of the crimes the couple were subjected to was accentuated I would recommend this film but in what I think may be a career first for Aniston this should be regarded as a main event film rather than the B movie/ feel good chick flick we are accustomed to seeing her in. I would urge the viewer to pay attention to the classification and I feel although it has been placed in the aEUR~15aEUR(tm) category I suspect it was very close to attracting an aEUR~18aEUR(tm) certificate. Obviously I donaEUR(tm)t have a list of the criteria used to classify films so this is simply my opinion I just know that I was shocked and a bit distressed by at least one scene. As well as the general malevolent feeling throughout the film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 28 2008Sean EllisFeaturedThis is one of those weak Hollywood films where characters are reduced to little more than plot elements who behave not according to human nature but merely to propel the action towards the next outlandish plot-point. Best suited to watching during a saturday morning hangover when brain-lag may be sufficient to compensate for all of the signposting.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 20 2008TechnoguyFeaturedA good well-plotted film which doesnt lay on the violence too thick but when it occurs can be shocking. The two leads are not George Clooney and Michelle Feiffer and there is little or no chemistrybut given the double-cross story that seems appropriate. What really caught me off guard was Jennifer Anistan as the bad girl with a respectable front.Clive Owen does these kind of films like sleep walking but this suits him better than ShootEm Up or Sin City where hes in danger of becoming stereotyped.Liked this film.

"Derailed | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; derailed ) Derailed (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoilers a sort of Although this is not a spoiler-heavy review there are implied spoilers. While specifics are not revealed anyone good at reading between lines may learn more about the movie than they want to. Those in search of a ""virgin"" movie experience are hereby warned. Derailed is yet another in the seemingly endless line of stupid generic thrillers that Hollywood foists upon the movie-going public. Tedious and predictable it employs obvious situations and clichA(c)s instead of genuine suspense-building elements. Those who havent figured out the movies ""twist"" long before its explicitly revealed are either thriller newbies or arent paying attention - a characteristic that is understandable considering the poor quality of whats on screen. A nap would be a better way to spend 105 minutes. Any dream that occurred during such a sleep period would offer a stronger narrative and more impressive character development than Derailed. Derailed doesnt begin off-track. The first twenty minutes are decent as the film examines some of the impulses that can lead to infidelity and the conflicting emotions that go along with a new affair. Once the movie enters thriller territory however it comes apart at the seams. Character development stops cold. Red herring subplots abound. And the main storyline plods along in such a pedestrian and unsurprising fashion that were always at least two steps ahead of the protagonist. This makes him seem slow and stupid. And theres neither energy nor atmosphere. Charles Schine (Clive Owen) is a faithful husband to his young-ish bride Deanna (Melissa George) and a dutiful father to his ill daughter Amy (Addison Timlin). He has no thoughts of straying until a chance encounter on a morning train with the ravishing Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) tempts him to temporarily put aside his vows. She like Charles is married although her union isnt as harmonious as his. Her husband is absent 24/7 but at least she has a darling three-year old daughter to keep her happy. Sparks fly between the two and they find themselves in a seedy hotel room about to consummate the relationship when they are interrupted. A Chicago thief with a French accent Philippe Laroche (Vincent Cassel) breaks in on them robs them beats up Charles and rapes Lucinda. That ordeal ends the not-really-begun affair but not the terror. Philippe begins blackmailing Charles and at Lucindas urging he decides not to go to the police opting instead to handle matters on his own. Clive Owen is one of the best actors working today but this may be the worst performance of his career. Perhaps understandably he looks bored by the material and the limited challenge of the role. Hes a void and his co-star doesnt help. Jennifer Aniston is miscast as the semi-femme fatale. The part requires more than she is able to give and we never believe her as Lucinda. The only one with any juice is Vincent Cassel but he can play a psychotic thug in his sleep. Its hard to know whether to blame Swedish-born director Mikael HAY=fstrAPm screenwriter Stuart Beattie or the guy who wrote the book James Siegel. Being a generous reviewer Ill spread the blame around. Derailed adds nothing to the genre and is an insult even to someone just on the lookout for a mindless thrill. (It delivers on the ""mindless"" part but not the ""thrill."") It makes the messy Where the Truth Lies seem like a model of coherence and intelligence. As for the dialoguea| the less said the better. Some of the lines in Derailed are cheesy enough that they may threaten to bring on a bout of giggles. Plus just to make sure the film doesnt clock in with too short a running length we get the obligatory ""fake ending."" Of course it will be obvious to anyone that another ""shock"" is on the way when everything has apparently been wrapped up and the movie is still chugging along. More apt names than Derailed dont come along often. At least The Weinstein Company amp; Miramax cant be accused with falseness in advertising where the title is concerned.

Starring Clive Owen Jennifer Aniston and Vincent Cassel. Directed by Mikael Hafstrom. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Derailed"" a decent guy puts himself and his family in peril all because of a sirens irresistible call. To register at such a high decibel an actress either must exude a natural sensuality the way Lana Turner did in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" or be a chameleon who makes a credible temptress even when sex appeal isnt her stock-in-trade. For paradigms of the latter see Barbara Stanwyck in ""Double Indemnity"" and Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction."" Dont bother to see Jennifer Anistons pallid imitation of a femme fatale in ""Derailed."" Aniston lacks the confidence on the big screen to extend her range beyond what comes easy like cute and perky. You never buy her as Lucinda a modern-day Eve who charms a married adman Charles (Clive Owen) into straying for the first time. Such a calamitous casting error alone would have derailed the movie. But its compounded by a ludicrous script whose twists and turns are laughably obvious or just plain laughable -- such as creating con artists so stupid that after pulling off one scam they immediately return to the crime scene and attempt it again. Not even Angelina Jolie could have saved this wannabe thriller although at least you would understand Charles compulsion to cheat. As it is its left almost entirely to the costume department to conjure up a seductress. Charles first view of Lucinda is from the side. He cranes his neck a few rows ahead on a commuter train and takes in a strangers shapely legs shown to their best advantage in dark hose and high heels. Approaching Lucinda he cant help but notice -- nor can the audience -- that her blouse is unbuttoned far enough to reveal cleavage. Later shes shown wearing a sheer top over a lace camisole to her high-powered job at a Chicago financial institution. The attire was chosen because the day is to culminate in her first tryst with Charles. They catch a cab in the rain to search for a suitable hotel. Lucinda rejects one because her husband takes clients there. Although theyre clearly in an upscale part of town suddenly the Bates Motel comes into view. All right thats not really its name. But the spooky ambience and lack of other customers evokes ""Psycho."" Sure enough evil lurks in those deserted halls. A violent criminal (Frances Vincent Cassel giving an overwrought performance in which even his French accent sounds phony) breaks into the lovers room robs them beats Charles until hes practically unconscious and repeatedly rapes Lucinda. The studio releasing ""Derailed"" has pressured critics not to spoil the surprise by revealing what happens next -- although most of the audience is sure to figure it out quicker than Charles whos awfully dense for someone who makes a living with his mind. The real surprise is that Owen so obviously a movie star if he could only find the right vehicle thought this might be it. Charles transformation from gentle homebody to vigilante pushing a car with a stiff behind the wheel into a river is preposterous. Still Owen does his best to be credible even while panting over Rachel Green from ""Friends"" and walks away from this train wreck relatively unscathed. The other surprise is that the talented Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom whose film ""Ondskan"" was Oscar nominated agreed to helm such a pile of nonsense. Perhaps the script was kept from him until the last minute so he wouldnt know its secrets and realize how inane they are. -- Advisory This film contains scenes of violence and disturbing sexual situations.

And not in a good way. We expect a lot from the Weinstein brothers first venture after they disbanded the original legendary Miramax studio. And we squirm when they cant deliver. We hope Jennifer Aniston can shed the relentless good nature of ""Friends"" and Rachel to lead us somewhere more interesting. And we have to shrug when she cant pull it off here. Were pretty sure the onscreen rape scene is part of an elaborate hoax but it still looks like a brutal assault. And we feel cheap for watching. For all those reasons and more ""Derailed"" is a most frustrating thriller. Shot without visual style sharp dialogue or discernible logic the movie seems to be riding entirely on the star power of Aniston Clive Owen and the boastful Weinsteins. Its not nearly enough. ""Derailed"" starts with a straw man and doesnt get much brainier from there. A man in prison - we dont see his face - begins writing a story. Clive Owen narrates the tale but it may not be him in that cell. Anyway. Owen plays Charles a decent family man and harried advertising executive trying to earn enough money for ongoing diabetic treatments of his ill teenage daughter. One day on the commuter train he meets Lucinda (Aniston) an equally harried family woman and financial adviser. They take the express track to an illicit romance. The problem is we dont trust Anistons character from the start. If everything was as it seemed there would be no movie plot right? So there must be a scam or a major twist or something. Our certainty about that eliminates most of the potential suspense. Director Mikael Hafstrom in his first feature outside Sweden does little to heighten the tension. A straight-ahead visual approach makes the story seem pedestrian and Stuart Beatties script offers up stock detectives brilliant criminals who talk too much and any other number of cliches. When a lieutenant says to Owen ""Youre a hard man to track down"" we stop expecting that Weinstein magic. Owen wakes up to his peril amid a ridiculous climactic gun battle that turns him from doughy executive to blazing sharpshooter in a Windy City second. Then were asked to swallow a half-dozen inconsistencies and police oversights to reach a second head-slapping climax. Anistons next movie is a romantic comedy which will likely suit her better than lying awkwardly in a stagey puddle of blood.  1/2 | ""Derailed"" R for sexual situations profanity graphic violence | 1 hour 45 minutes | THRILLER | Directed by Mikael Hafstrom written by Stuart Beattie; starring Clive Owen Jennifer Aniston Vincent Cassel RZA and Melissa George | Opens today at area theaters.

FACT BOXDerailed Starring Jennifer Aniston Clive Owen Vincent Cassel Giancarlo Esposito Directed by Mikael Hafstrom Written by Stuart Beattie Studio The Weinstein Co. YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Clive Owen Jennifer Aniston or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- You know this much from thrillers Bad things happen to good people. You can be at the right place at the wrong time. Changing a set schedule yields terrible results.All of these time-honored plot points come into play in ""Derailed"" with nail-biting consequences. The climax isnt much -- even the most mundane episode of ""Law amp; Order"" would have concluded more realistically -- but if you suspend a bit of logic and get on the ride its one heck of a good time with some surprising twists and turns.Charles Schine (Clive Owen) is a brooding husband. Hes drifted apart from his wife Deanna (Melissa George) though they maintain a united front for their daughter Amy (Addison Timlin) who is suffering from kidney failure and awaiting a transplant.One day Charlie who works at an ad agency misses his usual train into Chicago. On the train he meets a beautiful stranger Lucinda Harris played by Jennifer Aniston. She too is trapped in a dull marriage. Soon the two find themselves having lunch together which escalates into dinner and finally to a seedy hotel room.Then an armed man bursts into the room demanding their wallets and money and proceeds to pistol-whip Charles and rape Lucinda. After this horrendous ordeal they both decide not to go to the police in order to keep their affair a secret from their respective spouses. And as terrible as the event was both think it will end there.Of course theyre wrong.Making a caseThe armed robber Laroche (Vincent Cassel) begins to blackmail Charles. Laroche it appears is not a common mugger but a sophisticated criminal. As Laroches demands for money escalate so do his threats to do physical harm to Charles family. He even comes to Charles home posing as a client.Charles pleads with Lucinda to go to the police. She refuses. Without her testimony Charles lawyer tells Charles he has no case.Charles decides to take the situation into his own hands and now the film really gets twisted -- and entertaining. The lightning pace is maintained with excellent skill by Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom -- making his first English-language film -- as Charles enters a world way over his head.Look for hip-hop artists RZA and Xzibit in small but pivotal roles and Giancarlo Esposito as the Chicago detective looking into the mounting pile of bodies resulting from Charles vengefulness.Owen delivers a solid performance and Aniston is excellent in a demanding role that requires her to switch gears at some pivotal moments in the plot. The sexual chemistry between the two while not overwhelming is believable; overall they make a solid pair.Cassel isnt quite as good. His teeth-gnashing exertions diminish the otherwise natural relationships established by Aniston and Owen.Given that were now entering Oscar season ""Derailed"" -- a pure popcorn thriller -- may find it hard to make a dent at the box office. But it is worth seeing. Just stay on the ride.

Derailed Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2005) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/derailed-2005,200,derailed11,derailed,rogerebert
"Pulpy Derailed takes a predictable track - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Pulpy Derailed takes a predictable track By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 11 2005 Derailed"" is a tawdry predictable hunk of movie headcheese and I still had a pretty good time with it. As I walked out of the movie theater though I reminded myself that critics see these things for free and that if Id paid 9 plus Goobers and Coke like everybody else Id doubtless feel rooked. The issue here is return on investment and the ROI on this businesslike but not very bright little thriller starring Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston is minimal if not in the red. If you stumble across it at Blockbuster though or better yet if you turn on pay cable and its just starting power down your brain cells get a bowl of Chubby Hubby and settle in.The plot is as pulpy as the airport novel from whence it came. Frazzled suburban family man Charles Schine (Owen) a Chicago ad exec with a distant wife (Melissa George) and diabetic teen daughter (Addison Timlin) flirts with a fellow commuter on the train. Shes a financial adviser named Lucinda Harris (Aniston) and she has legs a middle-age man might focus on while pretending to read The Wall Street Journal. She also has a cool exterior that hints at a softer core; this constitutes the one lonely nuance of Anistons performance in Derailed"" and thespic duties thus dispatched the actress is free to look dazed while contemplating visions of Angelina Jolie in a wood chipper.Charles and Lucindas coy banter leads to lunches which lead to a dinner which leads to an erotically charged cab ride which leads to a hotel . . . and now I have to leave you at the doorstep because there are surprises afoot. To quote Charles as he helps his daughter with her book report in the films opening scene The author seduces the reader by twisting the narrative so you never know whats coming next."" (Yes its the first movie script written in yellow Hi-liter.) If youre willing to play as dumb as the characters though you stand to be shocked when Derailed"" takes a sudden turn for the ugly.The rest of us are just glad Vincent Cassel has turned up dripping merry French psychosis. The bad-boy actor (Irreversible"" Oceans Twelve"") plays Philippe Laroche an amoral street thug set on terrorizing Lucinda and blackmailing Charles into emptying his bank account. The neat trick of any Cassel performance is that its perched on the knife edge of gentility and homicide and so it is here Philippe can beat Charles until his ears bleed in one scene and in the next be sitting in Charless home in a trim suit charming his victims wife and daughter with naughty Gallic wit. When Charles comes home the two women look at him like hes the plumber.Owen walks through the film like a very good-looking two-by-four and I guess thats a sensible approach; he knows hell outclass the material if hes not careful. So the juice in Derailed"" is in the supporting roles including RZA as Winston the office mailboy and former jailbird who becomes Charless unlikely protector on the mean streets of Chicago. The rapper/producer/composer gives his character a sweet smile and dead eyes.After enough implausibilities and plot twists have piled up Derailed"" backs itself into a nifty little scene where everyones gun points at everyone else and you wait for the first shot to start the pinballs flying. If director Mikael Hafstrom had given the whole movie the stupid unrepentant energy of that scene we might have had a fine piece of B-movie sleaze. As it is Derailed"" suggests classic film noirs like 1945s Scarlet Street"" (just out on DVD and talk about return on investment) stripped down to pure functionality. Sometimes thats enough but only on TV and only when no one else is awake.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

But any similarities to Alfred Hitchcock end there for this clumsy miscast thriller. Clive Owen and Jennifer Anistons characters have a seemingly chance affair and things quickly turn dangerous. Weinstein Company Clive Owen playing a character who is slow on the uptake is a married Chicago ad agency pro who has lost his professional touch just as his daughter who has type 1 diabetes needs expensive cutting-edge treatment. Life is complicated and it gets more so when finding himself without cash at the train station he allows a dressed-for-success good-looking business executive to pay for his ticket from the suburbs into the city. Shes played by Jennifer Aniston an actress about as born to femme fatale roles as fellow Friends alum Matthew Perry would be to play Winston Churchill. Still Anistons Lucinda Harris is flashy enough and Owens characters wife (Melissa George) is fed up just enough at home for this husbands eye to roam. One thing leads to you-know-what and the two end up at a seedy hotel. About the movie Derailed  1/2 (out of four) Stars Clive Owen Jennifer Aniston Vincent Cassel Melissa George Giancarlo Esposito Xzibit RZA Director Mikael Hafstrom Distributor The Weinstein Company Rating R for strong disturbing violence language and some sexuality Running time 1 hour 46 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Owens Charles Schine fails to latch the rooms door an assailant enters knocks him cold rapes Lucinda and makes off with IDs and credit cards setting up a blackmail scheme. There goes the dialysis savings. The movie depends on the kind of coincidences and strokes of bad fortune that audiences will accept when a filmmaker is more adept than Swedens Mikael Hafstrom who is directing his first Hollywood production. What he gives is drawn-out clunky and uneasily acted as well as exasperating. Without getting specific its tough to imagine anyone being unable to predict the key plot twist here including a high school classmate of mine who once famously asked whether the years homecoming game was going to be played at home or away. In Derailed we share characters pain but not in the ways intended.

With Jennifer Aniston Clive Owen. (100 min.)""Derailed"" is a penny dreadful with A-list stars. Clive Owen who really should have tried harder to be cast as the next James Bond plays a Chicago ad executive who meets a magnetically friendly commuter played by Jennifer Aniston on the morning train to work. Though both are married with children they soon find themselves booking a seedy hotel room. Enter Vincent Cassel who one might think had his fill of this kind of thing after starring in ""Irreversible."" What happens next shall remain a secret but heres a hint Retribution awaits. Heres another Stay home. Grade C- Peter RainerGet Rich or Die Tryin (R)Director Jim Sheridan. With 50 Cent Joy Bryant Terrence Howard. (134 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Lightning didnt strike twice. Eminem made an improbably strong movie debut in ""8 Mile"" but now theres ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" which stars his rapper protege Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson. I had high hopes - its director is Jim Sheridan (""My Left Foot"" ""In America""); and Terence Howard whos on a roll has a meaty part in it. But this thinly autobiographical gangsta odyssey never achieves liftoff and Jackson is unconvincing. Even if you are playing (essentially) yourself it helps if youre an actor first. Grade C-- P.R. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Sex/Nudity 11 scenes including nudity and sex Violence 19 scenes including torture. Profanity 295 harsh expressions. Drugs 5 scenes with drinking 7 scenes with smoking and 11 scenes with drug use or selling.Zathura A Space Adventure (PG)Director Jon Favreau. With Tim Robbins Frank Oz Jonah Bobo. (113 min.)Two squabbling brothers home alone for a few minutes find an old board game in the basement with mysterious not to mention dangerous properties. Once the duo sets the game in motion they not only find their home adrift in outer space but also have to learn teamwork to cope with a demented robot and attacks by Zorgons (meat-eating pyromaniac lizard-men). Here appropriately retro effects and family values outweigh an episodic script. After the screening a preteen next to this critic asked his mom ""Why did you think I wouldnt like this?"" Theres your endorsement. Grade B-- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity 1 instance of mild innuendo. Violence 15 scenes. Profanity 5 mild expressions. Drugs None.Still in ReleaseThe Legend of Zorro (PG)Director Martin Campbell. With Antonio Banderas Catherine Zeta-Jones. (100 min.)""The Legend of Zorro"" starring Antonio Banderas as the masked one made me long to re-watch ""Zorro the Gay Blade"" the great spoof starring George Hamilton. In that film the Spanish accents were meant to sound deliberately fake. (Zorro kept referring to ""the people"" as ""the pipple."" ) Here even Banderas sounds like hes having a hard time sounding authentic. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Zorros swashbuckling wife Elena looks fetching but doesnt have much to do otherwise. Zorros nemesis a French aristocrat played by Rufus Sewell sports heavy eyeliner and has plans to blow up America. He seems to be under the misapprehension that Zorro is James Bond. Grade C-- Peter RainerParadise Now (PG-13)Director Hany Abu-Assad. With Kais Nashef Ali Suliman. (90 min.)Said (Nashef) and his friend Khaled (Suliman) are recruited as human bombs by an underground Palestinian terrorist organization in the West Bank in the intermittently powerful ""Paradise Now"" which was directed and co-written by Hany Abu-Assad. He attempts with mixed results to get inside the psyches of men who would blow themselves up for the cause. The film is better than the recent ""The War Within"" which tried for the same things but ultimately and perhaps unavoidably we are left face to face with the unknowable. Grade B+- P.R.Domino (R)Director Tony Scott. With Keira Knightley Mickey Rourke Lucy Liu. (127 min.)The real-life Domino a Bounty Hunter who died in June of an apparent overdose was the daughter of actor Laurence Harvey and supermodel socialite Pauline Stone. Clearly what lured director Tony Scott who knew Domino is the massive contradiction of her life Born into the glamour of London and Beverly Hills she ended up a female Rambo. Whatever reality the actual Domino may have possessed has been sliced and diced by Scotts usual barrage of whiplash camera work and rat-a-tat editing complete with flashbacks flash forwards and flash in-betweens. Grade C-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 8 scenes including nudity and implied sex Violence 20 brutal scenes. Profanity 186 harsh expressions. Drugs 30 scenes with drinking and 28 scenes with smoking.Dreamer Inspired by a True Story (PG)Director John Gatins. With Kurt Russell Dakota Fanning. (102 min.)When racehorse Sonador breaks a leg trainer Ben Crane (Russell) sees a potential brood mare if he can at least get her well enough to walk. Weve seen it all before but this one is so well made its a sure crowd pleaser. Grade B- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity None. Violence 2 mild scenes. Profanity 4 mild expressions. Drugs None.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (R)Director Shane Black. With Val Kilmer Robert Downey Jr. (102 min.)As a petty thief turned aspiring actor and detective in Shane Blacks raucously entertaining ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" Robert Downey Jr. is on screen almost all the time which is good news since few performers can hold the screen as well. His live-wire physicality is capable of just about anything. In his new film he uses it for comic effect; at times he is as jumpy and jerky as a cartoon character (Bugs Bunny to be exact). Black who wrote ""Lethal Weapon"" makes his directorial debut and he puts a fresh spin not only on that film but also on a whole slew of films noirs. Grade B+- Peter RainerSex/Nudity 13 scenes including nudity. Violence 20 gory scenes. Profanity 130 harsh expressions. Drugs 9 scenes with drinking. 8 scenes with smoking.North Country (R)Director Niki Caro. With Charlize Theron Woody Harrelson. (126 min.)Theron plays a battered wife who fights sexual harassment at her job in the iron mines. She has her best role since ""Monster"" but overall ""North Country"" is too self-consciously scaled as an anthem for the human spirit. Grade B-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 16 scenes of innuendo and sexual harassment. Violence 8 scenes including one of rape. Profanity 76 harsh expressions. Drugs 11 scenes with smoking. 10 scenes with drinking.The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio. (pg-13)Director Jane Anderson. With Julianne Moore Woody Harrelson Laura Dern. (99 min.)Evelyn Ryan rewrote the definition of resilience in the 50s and 60s supporting ten children and an alcoholic husband by composing jingles and 25-word essays to win hundreds of contests. Moore makes a perfect Evelyn always upbeat and Harrelson as her ineffectual husband is borderline tragic. The film veers from tongue-in-cheek documentary to gritty drama to sitcom but its true to the spirit of daughter Terrys book and of Evelyns life - lumpy but filled with expectancy of good and utterly charming. Grade B - M.K.T.Sex/Nudity None. Violence 4 scenes. Profanity 25 expressions. Drugs 8 scenes with drinking.Shopgirl (R)Director Anand Tucker. With Steve Martin Claire Danes. (104 min.)Martin plays a dotcom millionaire who successfully woos Mirabelle (Danes) a salesgirl at Saks. Whether intentionally or not Martin has given us something truly spooky A full-fledged portrait of a hollow man. Grade B- P.R.Sex/Nudity 13 frank scenes of innuendo and sex. Violence None. Profanity 9 fairly mild expressions. Drugs 3 scenes with smoking. 11 scenes with drinking.Ushpizin (PG)Director Giddi Dar. With Shuli Rand Michal Bat-Sheva Rand Shaul Mizrahi. (90 min.)On the eve of the Succoth holiday in Israel Moshe and his wifes prayers are answered when the destitute couple finds the money they need to buy the required palm myrtle willow and citron for the festival - with enough left over for groceries and rent. They also get a ""blessing"" they didnt pray for ushpizin (holiday guests) in the form of two convicts from Moshes criminal past. Compassion reverence and subtle humor help this collaboration between ultra-Orthodox Israeli actors and secular filmmakers to rise above its modest budget. Grade B- M.K.T.Sex/Nudity None. Violence 4 mild scenes. Profanity 3 mild expressions. Drugs 5 scenes with alcohol and 10 scenes with smoking.

"Derailed On the Right Track washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Derailed On the Right Track Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston have a rendezvous that goes horribly awry in ""Derailed."" (Weinstein Co.) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday November 11 2005 ""Derailed"" takes the A train all the way to the end of the line. Its fast slick stupid violent fun and despite the cynically high body count without serious intention in this world. Derived from a thriller by James Siegel a sort of ""Brief Encounter"" with guns Swedish director Mikael Hafstroms film is set in motion when Charlie (Clive Owen) has an affair with Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston) whom he has met on a train. Shes a smart chic woman and like Charlie somewhat worn down by life oppressed by circumstances and has a mate who no longer lights her fires and she no longer lights his. So theyre trysting the night away having set up an elaborate ruse to fool their spouses when suddenly the world goes out of whack Feral man enters stage right through an unchained no-tell hotel door in the form of Philippe Laroche (Vincent Cassel who does feral beautifully) with an automatic pistol and a sense of cruel Hobbesian domination. He pistol-whips Charlie rapes Lucinda takes money credit cards cell phones dignity and any sense of the universe as rational. Charlie is ashamed that he could do nothing to overcome his adversary yet now hes caught in a mesh of lies; Lucinda insists that he not go to the police. Then Philippe calls him He wants money. What can Charlie do? He is trapped. Eventually the movie waltzes toward the absurd the unbelievable daring you to break faith then veering back toward some sort of just-marginal believability. Your connection to it is likely to be determined by your ability to suspend disbelief. Most people can; about one in five simply cant. Its as Jacobean revenge theater that ""Derailed"" is on its best footing documenting how the tired dispirited joyless suburban dad finds his inner psycho and takes no prisoners. -- Stephen Hunter Derailed R 120 minutes Contains extreme violence and sexual scenes.

Basically ""Unfaithful"" for men ""Derailed"" is a nightmarish cautionary tale about a husband who strays from the marriage bed and ends up paying for it throughout the rest of the movie. Predicated on the novel but unrewarding spectacle of Clive Owen getting smacked around for nearly two hours this murky psychological suspenser manages the tricky feat of being as predictable as it is finally preposterous. One can only hope it will be mostly uphill from here artistically and commercially for the fledgling Weinstein Co. whose first release this is. Pic reps a fascinating intersection of cultures both in front of and behind the camera Directed by Swedish helmer Mikael Hafstrom here making his Hollywood debut the cast features two Euro thesps (Owen and Vincent Cassel) two hip-hop artists (RZA and Xzibit) and one all-American sweetheart (Jennifer Aniston). Result is a perplexing stew that in its insoluble blend of tones temperaments and hackneyed genre standards at times plays like a high-toned exploitation picture. Charles Schine (Owen) is on the verge of a mid-life crisis underappreciated by his wife Deanna (Melissa George) their sickly daughter Amy (Addison Timlin) and the swanky Chicago advertising firm where he works. A missed train hurls him into the path of the lovely sassy Lucinda Harris (Aniston) who turns out to have an unhappy marriage and a daughter of her own. After some initial flirting that somewhat ill-advisedly references Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saints naughty transcontinental banter in ""North by Northwest"" Charles and Lucinda begin to date and confide in one another. Just as they are about to consummate their relationship however a Gallic gunman named LaRoche (Cassel) bursts into their motel room beats Charles to a pulp steals his wallet and in a hideous leering scene forces himself on Lucinda while her would-be lover lies helpless in the corner. Terrified that the truth about their affair will come out Lucinda and Charles opt not to file a police report. Soon however LaRoche begins threatening Charles by phone demanding first 20000 then 100000 in cash. Protags subsequent actions serve as a textbook example of what not to do if youre ever blackmailed by a violent psycho rapist with the screw-loose LaRoche and his henchman Dexter (Xzibit in an effective showboating turn) decisively maintaining the upper hand. Charles decision not to go to the police comes back to haunt him while his pitiful efforts to fight back at one point involving his ex-con co-worker Winston (RZA) lead to terrible repercussions. Repeatedly emphasizing Charles inability to protect Lucinda his family or himself ""Derailed"" derives most of its juice from a sort of free-floating castration anxiety -- a threat made literal in one scene when LaRoche grabs Charles by the nether-regions and throws him against the wall of his own home. Owen has always been at his best playing smooth British badasses in films like ""Croupier"" and ""Gosford Park"" and its simply no fun seeing him as a dumb schmuck. Despite a lingering hint of an English accent that lends the role a somewhat rarefied cosmopolitan air thesp cant help but tamp down his own natural charisma. After years of indifferent rom-com typecasting Aniston in her first thriller role since 1993s cult classic ""Leprechaun"" delivers a damsel-in-distress performance that convinces scene by scene though her relatively brief screen time precludes the possibility of desperately needed character development. Overall chemistry between the two leads is wan at best. For his part Cassel has fun with an outrageously over-the-top turn as his characters villainous role reversals require him to switch between French and thuggish American accents with almost Meryl Streep-like aplomb. Still hes been more magnetic and convincingly volatile in his European body of work. Working from James Siegels novel screenwriter Stuart Beattie (""Collateral"") demonstrates an ear for literate dialogue and plays scrupulously fair with the clues -- perhaps too scrupulously as the inevitable plot twists likely will surprise no one whos been paying attention. Everything from the storys bookend structure (the opening and closing scenes are set in prison) to the abundant references to other crime movies -- Charles finds himself in a succession of Hitchcockian wrong-man scenarios and in addition at one point even sports a ""Chinatown""-style nose bandage -- suggests a vain attempt to bring coherence and wit to frankly implausible material. Stylistically Hafstrom is all over the map veering from the scuzziest back alleys of Chicago to the cool urban menace of Charles workplace yet never really developing the race and class tensions that fitfully puncture the narrative. Rap-heavy soundtrack makes for an interesting fit with Edward Shearmurs trance-inflected score.
