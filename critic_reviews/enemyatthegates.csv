Comments (3) Enemy at the Gates Another prowar movie to go with Saving Private Ryan (which it visibly imitates) safely set during World War II--specifically at the battle of Stalingrad--though it seems perfectly willing to make us feel better about killing Arabs in the present. (Maybe to show that it has its heart in the right place it ends like Reds in a hospital.) Jude Law is a Soviet sharpshooter English actors plays most of the other Russians (including Bob Hoskins camping like crazy as Nikita Khrushchev) and Ed Harris is a Nazi sharpshooter. Theres never much risk of reality intruding--just a lot of histrionic James Horner music (fortunately only semiaudible under the gunfire) and plenty of designer stubble on the soldiers faces. The director delivering these time-tested goods is Jean-Jacques Annaud who with Alain Godard adapted William Craigs book. The actors--who also include Joseph Fiennes Rachel Weisz and Ron Perlman outfitted with a jaw full of fillings--do a pretty good job though not good enough to sustain 133 minutes.

"USATODAY.com - Epic showdown Gates is its own worst enemy Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/16/2001 - Updated 1042 AM ET Epic showdown Gates is its own worst enemy By Mike Clark USA TODAY Enemy at the Gates out of four Stars Jude Law Ed Harris Joseph Fiennes Rachel Weisz Ron Perlman Director Jean-Jacques Annaud Distributor Paramount Rating R for strong graphic war violence and some sexuality Fought in meat-grinder fashion for 180 days in 1942-43 the Battle of Stalingrad became a make-or-break showdown between Russia and Germany in World War II. So maybe its appropriate that Enemy at the Gates builds to a High Noon kind of duel between two celebrated snipers prowling dockside rubble as far as the eye can see. ""Build"" however is a flattering word; the story hits and misses for more than two hours following its opening artillery bloodbath. Yet in these event-starved moviegoing days theres something to be said for giving a massive historical backdrop A-list production design and scoring (by Braveheart/Titanics James Horner). For the many who still equate ""real movies"" with ambition plus visual heft Gates stands out from the underfed studio pack now in theaters. Jude Law plays real-life sharpshooter Vassili Zaitsev a Russian farm kid whose skill at eliminating Nazis wins him lots of propaganda ink in morale-starved Stalingrad. The information officer crafting the image that Law reluctantly acknowledges is played by Shakespeare in Loves Joseph Fiennes the perpetually not-so-fine Fiennes whos the brother of Ralph. When the two gradually lock horns over a woman (Rachel Weisz) the rudely uneven acting matchup cant generate much tension. Fortunately Law has a compelling adversary in German counterpart Ed Harris whos so skilled at underplaying with his eyes that casting such a notably American actor works. Gates in fact recalls those international co-productions of the 60s in which actors of all nationalities played World War II combatants of all nationalities. Video USA TODAYs Mike Clark reviews Enemy at the Gates Another surprise is seeing Bob Hoskins (who once played Josef Stalin) as Nikita Khrushchev. Assigned to oversee the citys defense Hoskins Khrushchev barks orders to Fiennes scribe with the actors typical zeal. Zeal is what the movie is missing in its later scenes when the love story starts becoming a distracting appendage. Indeed one might even make the case that director Jean-Jacques Annauds epic might have worked better dramatically as a smaller more focused picture. The best scenes simply involve Law and Harris playing sneaky professional games (less cat-and-mouse than cat-and-cat) with each other. But a scaled-down rendering wouldnt have needed the spectacularly grungy canvas of mud flames busted pipes and expansive flophouses. And in the end that canvas is what impresses most.

Handout Photo History Diminished / Epic combat scenes in ""Enemy at the Gates dwindle into personal vendetta 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ENEMY AT THE GATES Drama. Starring Jude Law Rachel Weisz Joseph Fiennes and Ed Harris. Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It was about time Stalingrad got the big-screen treatment. D-Day -- everyones favorite World War II battle -- was pure hell but after one long day it was clear whod won. Stalingrad lasted six months was a slaughter on all sides and shaped the course of not only the war but also the postwar world. Perhaps the lineup of combatants has kept this monumental event in human history from proper cinematic attention. In a battle between Hitler and Stalin the audience may know whom to root for but its hard to get out the pom-poms and megaphones for Uncle Joe. Yet its precisely the moral mess that was Stalingrad -- in addition to all the carnage and confusion -- that makes the battle compelling. For a while ""Enemy at the Gates"" seems like the messy epic this conflict deserves. The picture shows the direct influence of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with war scenes of uncompromising horror and pandemonium. After a brief prologue that establishes country boy Vassili (Jude Law) as a marksman we see him as a young soldier heading to the front. Jammed onto a boat with other soldiers he experiences a terrifying crossing of the Volga River as Nazi planes fire killing and wounding men before they have a chance to fight. Director Jean-Jacques Annaud (""The Bear"" ""Seven Years in Tibet"") presents Stalingrad as a demolished city of smoking ruins where battles are fought in the streets. Without enough rifles to go around the army gives one gun to every other man. (When the rifle-carrying soldier is killed the other soldiers job is to pick up the gun.) The skirmishes are brutal and the retreats are worse. The Soviets kill any of their own seen running away from the enemy. This kind of thing is called ""friendly fire"" when its an accident. Here its no accident. With ""Enemy at the Gates"" going along so powerfully it almost seems too bad that a plot should intrude on this fascinating historical re-creation. It happens when Joseph Fiennes as Danilov of the propaganda office witnesses an amazing feat of shooting by Vassili and decides to promote him as a hero. Vassili a sniper who picks off a series of German officers becomes a symbol of hope. Yet just as ""Enemy at the Gates"" seems as if its about to expand in scope -- using the exploits of Vassili a true historical figure to tell the story of the Soviet peoples struggle -- the movie begins to contract. It keeps contracting until the battle of Stalingrad is reduced to the story of two snipers out to shoot each other. Ed Harris is the other sniper an icy German major named Konig who comes to Stalingrad to kill Vassili and break the heart of all good Russians everywhere. Much of the rest of the film amounts to a cat-and-mouse game between Konig and Vassili with each man taking turns being the cat. These scenes are not without interest but they pale in comparison to the street fights that went before. ""Enemy at the Gates"" also concerns itself with a love triangle between Vassili Danilov and Tania a Jewish student played by Rachel Weisz. Tania and Vassili love each other but Danilov is jealous -- and when Fiennes looks jealous he starts looking a lot like F. Murray Abraham. Weisz a versatile actress with a lot of fire makes a sympathetic heroine and her romantic interlude with Law will raise a few pulses. But Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"" was right. With the world coming to an end the problems of three little people really dont amount to a hill of beans. After ""Enemy at the Gates"" teases us with the promise of something big its hard to be happy with a small-scale story. Aside from Harris all the actors speak with English accents. At times the sight of reserved English actors slapping hugging and acting all Russian looks bizarre though one casting choice is prime Bob Hoskins has the ideal air of impish menace in the featured role of Khrushchev.

The story takes place during the Battle of Stalingrad a theater of unspeakable carnage that left thousands of German and Russian soldiers dead from bullets bombs freezing cold and starvation. Writer-director Jean-Jacques Annaud orchestrates a couple of ambitious confrontations that will undoubtedly be compared to the staggering battle scenes in Steven Spielbergs ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998). Unfortunately Annauds technical virtuosity far outweighs his ability to draw pathos from the brutality. Meanwhile the story suffers from a romance that seems more than a little bit out of place given that the lovers are continually covered in mud and praying that they wont be shot dead. Annaud who co-wrote the script with Alain Godard based his screenplay on a true story but you have to figure that he took more than a little bit of poetic license with the facts. Introduction to warfare Jude Law plays Vassili Zaitsev a quiet soldier who quickly becomes the most feared sniper in the Russian Army. Vassilis introduction to warfare is one of the opening scenes and its a high point that the rest of the movie cant live up to Scores of raw recruits climb out of jam-packed boats while dense enemy fire sends flesh and blood flying and dead bodies lie everywhere. The Russians running out of weapons fight in pairs. As one person gets killed his partner is supposed to pick up his rifle and start firing. At first Vassili runs helplessly behind one shooter holding a handful of ammunition and dodging bullets. When the Germans start winning the skirmish hes forced to play dead among a pile of his departed comrades -- among whom he finds a Soviet political officer named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) whos also playing possum. Danilov a not particularly able shot hands off his rifle to Vassili who proceeds to pick off several unsuspecting Germans with pinpoint shots to the head. Danilov recognizes the propagandistic potential of Vassilis skills. He approaches his commander Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins ... and yes hes that Nikita Khrushchev) about playing up Vassilis accomplishments in the newspapers. The somewhat trumped-up press turns Vassili into a poster boy for Russian resistance. The Nazis recognize that they have to get rid of him so they bring in a sharpshooter of their own an elegant warrior named Major Konig (Ed Harris). From that point on out Annaud tries rather ineffectively to convert one of the bloodiest battles of the 20th century into a series of confrontations between two obsessed men. Haphazard sketches Still if he had stopped there this would have been a solid visually arresting action movie. But Rachel Weisz is also on hand as Tania a beautiful Russian foot soldier.

Enemy At The Gates Movie Review (2001) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/enemy-at-the-gates-2001,200,enemyatthegates8,enemyatthegates,rogerebert

(Paramount) I dont want this to come out the wrong way but Ed Harris makes an excellent Nazi. In ""Enemy at the Gates"" set during the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942 hes the immaculately dressed Major Koenig a German patrician who proudly wears his Iron Cross speaks only when its essential and smokes his gold-tipped cigarettes with the clipped savoir-faire of any great James Bond villain. He holds his cigarette at a stiff 90 degree angle savoring the smoke that he has just inhaled his thoughts tenaciously focused on his mission to kill a certain persistent Russian sniper. Koenig is a sniper himself the best in Germany. This is going to be quite a matchup. This Russian sniper (Jude Law) a peasant named Vassily Zaitsev has been hiding in the ruins of Stalingrad plugging Germans by the dozen. His kills have become a sort of celebrated score sheet for Stalins public relations mill; Vassily is an instant celebrity the savior of his people a hero for all time. Hope like that can change the outcome of a battle. Naturally the Germans need such a figure dead. In ""Enemy"" it comes down to this a single bullet in either snipers brain is going to settle the Battle of Stalingrad and World War II once and for all. Does it get more riveting than this? There are other people involved in this chess game a Russian apparatchik named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) and his communist boss (Bob Hoskins) who are using Vassilys success for the peoples dailies; Tania (Rachel Weisz) a Jewish sniper who wants to shoot the Germans who just executed her parents and whos falling in love with Vassily; and the teenaged Sasha (Gabriel Thomson) whose fickle impulses (hes an informant for both sides) could be Vassilys undoing. An ambitious war epic (many scenes of massive slaughter and the destruction of Stalingrad) featuring a quintessentially American actor (Harris) as a Nazi major a trio of People magazine cover-Brits (Jude Law Joseph Fiennes Rachel Weisz) as Russian soldiers and all of this directed by the Frenchman (Jean-Jacques Annaud) who made ""The Name of the Rose"" well it gives you pause doesnt it monsieur mein Freund mate dude or comrade? But as long as you focus on the central sniper-versus-sniper story - and not the dreadful mishmash of jarring accents or the films unconvincing romantic subplot or any of the personal relationships - youll enjoy it. Sure thats a lot of things to ignore but theres ample enough left to enjoy. The movie based on the real exploits of a Russian sniper during World War II certainly keeps your attention locked and loaded. Thats because most of the time we are watching Vassily and Major Koenig in deep perpetual concentration. They are after one thing the perfect shot. And theyre using the massively broken and destroyed Stalingrad as their battle ground. A downed Luftwaffe plane kilometers of old rusty factory pipes broken walls a cast-iron stove the littered bodies of soldiers - these are things to hide behind. These are the milestones along that painful crawl to the perfect vantage point. This movie may seem to some like little more than boys war games. But director Annaud who wrote this with Alain Godard knows how to milk the suspense. Its clear that Annaud has seen and appropriated some of the gruesome battle details used by Steven Spielberg in ""Saving Private Ryan."" If nothing else you really understand the impact of a bullet in this movie. And you appreciate the compelling excitement of shooting to kill before the other guy gets you first. ""Enemy at the Gates"" (R 131 minutes) - Contains graphic war violence nudity and sexual scenes.

Its not audience friendly of course to pin Greatest Generation medals on the lapels of soldiers who fought for the triumph of Nazis and its iffy to cheer for Russians whose status changed from allies to Commies. But the American story has been pretty thoroughly co-opted in recent years by Spielberg Hanks Tom Brokaw et al. so whats a showman with an eye towards the international market to do? French filmmaker Jean Jacques Annaud who most recently skirted pesky fascism in ""Seven Years in Tibet"" hit on an interesting solution His ""Enemy at the Gates"" cowritten with Alain Godard is a war movie in which the Nazidom of the Germans and the Commiedom of the Russians is barely noted - a World War II movie deracinated from history and politics. (Not enough apparently for local residents who sat glumly through this picture when it was the inexplicable selection to open last months Berlin Film Festival.) ""Enemy"" acknowledges the cinematic importance of hideous bullet wounds smashed bodies and graphic images of death - ""Ryan"" has forever raised the stakes on depicting the suffering of grunts - but at its dumbly effective romantic heart the movie is a simplified ""happy"" heros story based on the fame of a real Russian army recruit Vassili Zaitsev and immeasurably amped by the grubby beauty of Jude Law in the role. Zaitsev was indeed an actual national hero a shepherd from the Urals whose hunting skills were put to patriotic use during the cataclysmic Battle of Stalingrad. In 1942 and 1943 his bulls eye aim helped rally the desperate decimated Red Army and demoralize the Nazis who had until then been unstoppable. And Zaitsev is indeed alleged to have faced a showdown with an equally talented Nazi shooter here turned into German nobleman Major Konig (Ed Harris playing the part with precisely the kind of modulated rectitude he had no use for in portraying Jackson Pollock). For that matter Zaitsev is said to have had a love affair with a female soldier here named Tania and played by Rachel Weisz. But surely not so schmaltzily. Not backed by an unrelentingly swelling score meted out by ""Titanic"" music composer James Horner; not with battles invoking ""Gladiator""; ""Gone With the Wind"" and paintings by J.M.W. Turner; and not with such panoply staged for the sake of filling the frame. The entire Battle of Stalingrad in which some 800000 Axis troops and over a million Soviet soldiers died ultimately comes down to a class struggle between two handsome men with rifles? Annaud and cinematographer Robert Fraisse (who also shot ""Tibet"") take great pains with their panoramic meticulously plotted combat scenes including an opening sequence with a familiar feel in which terrified Red conscripts are mowed down as they enter Stalingrad. But the greatest pains are taken over lighting the gold flecked eyes of Law the burning blue peepers of Harris and for good measure the chocolatey brown orbs of Joseph Fiennes cast in the prop role of Danilov a political officer in unheroic wire rimmed glasses. Without Danilov thered be no movie style competition for Tanias affections. Without him thered also be no efficient way to establish Zaitsevs reputation. ""What we need are heroes"" Danilov tells then general Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins with nifty prosthetic makeup) then goes about promoting the modest country boy through the newspaper articles he writes. (The intellectually snobby politically active schemer and Khrushchev yes man who the script quite randomly and quite specifically points out as Jewish may not handle a big gun but hes got a mighty pen.) Fiennes is done no great service by being handed such an all purpose mop of a character with which to clean up such inconvenient odds and ends as say politics and religion and he acquits himself almost as well as his brother Ralph did spanning the history of Nazism and Communism last year in ""Sunshine."" Harris is handed no prize in Major Konig either since most of his evil involves sitting gracefully silent in a wardrobe of precisely cut jackets waiting for his prey to appear. (As for Weisz her big reward is a sex scene cunningly obscured by grime and raggedy blankets.) The one valuable prize for audiences in this war pic Cracker Jack box is Jude Law. Once again the talented Mr. Law makes more of a role than most movies know what to do with. (""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" rose to his occasion.) And in that regard at least the financiers of Enemy at the Gates are right International audiences may not want to hear too much about Nazis but nobody is above the Law.

Proving again that war is hell and some war films are too Jean-Jacques Annauds ""Enemy at the Gates"" takes a great setting some resonant themes a turning point in 20th-century history -- and bleeds them of all power with bad dialogue and uninspired direction. Though visually impressive the reputedly 95 million production -- mostly financed by Teuton companies and shot entirely within Germany -- shows a consistent inability to generate any kind of drama when characters open their mouths as well as suffering from some spectacular miscasting in its higher reaches. Decidedly European in look narrative and tempo and with little for American audiences to empathize with pic looks likely to be an early casualty in wide release Stateside due March 16; outside the U.S. business looks likely to be spotty with weakest legs in territories where auds can actually understand the bad English dialogue. Though not credited on screen title comes from William Craigs book ""Enemy at the Gates"" about a duel between a Russian shepherd and a German nobleman during the Battle of Stalingrad (1942-43) one of the great turning points of World War II in which the Germans finally were defeated in their march eastward by stubborn resistance from the Russians. Annaud and co-scripter Alain Godard (""Quest for Fire"" ""The Name of the Rose"") were given access to the original files of the Russian -- Vassili Zaitsev -- but found a conflicting series of legends and stories that they fashioned into a screenplay. On paper the pics blueprint is promising A duel to the death in a bombed-to-hell city between a German nobleman and a Russian peasant; a love triangle among a woman the peasant and his friend in charge of Soviet propaganda; a background of Germanys most disastrous military defeat and the unimaginable suffering and slaughter of the citys Russian population; and the feel of being on a cusp of history -- the winter of 1942-43 -- which Nazi Germany entered at the height of its powers but exited on the decline. However on almost every level Annaud as both director and co-writer drops his main cards. Pic has no sense of history even less of the citys physical geography or everyday life of its population (unlike Joseph Vilsmaiers 1993 ""Stalingrad"") and features three massively miscast Brits in leading roles notably bright-eyed pretty-as-a-picture Jude Law as Vassili from the Urals. The only real human drama on screen lies in Ed Harris interpretation of the German marksman Koenig a perf in which dialogue is -- wisely -- mostly dispensed with and the actor is left to create a character from looks brief exchanges and mostly notably real screen charisma. In a nod to the otherwise Euro casting Harris also flattens out his American accent. After a brief pre-credits sequence that we only later realize is Vassili as a child hunter-marksman back home in the countryside pic proper opens on Sept. 20 1942 with a 10-minute sequence clearly inspired by ""Saving Private Ryan"" in which Vassili (Law) is transported to Stalingrad by train and shipped into the bombarded city across the River Volga (town is present-day Volgograd). While lacking the sheer visceral clout of its equivalent in ""Ryan"" its an undeniably impressive opening with good f/x for the shattered Russian burg and a realistic feeling of shooting fish in a barrel as Russian relief troops are shipped across the River Volga and then battle their way up the exposed banks into the citys heart. On the way Vassili picks off five Germans when he bumps into Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) a young Russian who lends him his rifle. Danilov who is attached to the Soviet war efforts political unit is impressed by the young peasants marksmanship and elevates him to the status of a hero to inspire the local population in their seemingly hopeless struggle against superior forces. On one sniper expedition Vassili is befriended by Sasha (Gabriel Marshall-Thomson) a kid whose mother (German thesp Eva Mattes revoiced with an unsuitably posh English accent) introduces Vassili to her neighbor Tanya (Rachel Weisz). Unfortunately Danilov also develops the hots for Tanya whose Jewish parents were carted away by the Germans. With the arrival of Koenig (Harris) 35 minutes in the picture immediately ratchets up several dramatic notches with a character who is both believable and played by an actor who can hold the screen. A one-on-one private war begins between the two sharpshooters each setting traps for the other -- Koenig to kill the ""myth"" of Vassili and Vassili more and more nervous about living up to the legend created by Danilov. The four sniper sequences that pepper the balance of the running time contain the best of the movie with dialogue reduced to a minimum and cutting and camerawork creating miniatures of drama and suspense with a particularly good standoff in a bombed factory in which Vassili is cornered. Beyond those however Annaud shows yet again in his career that hes a landscape rather than an actors director (viz. ""Seven Years in Tibet""). Dialogue is generally pedestrian and often bathetic with Law totally out of his depth in a role that requires peasant cunning vs. Harris aristocratic poise and coolness; Weisz an actress especially in need of a strong director largely at sea as a token Jewess who functions as little more than a plot point; and Fiennes simply looking wrong as a political propagandist caught up in a poorly drawn love triangle. Ron Perlman appears all too briefly as a veteran Russian sniper. An extended cameo by Bob Hoskins as a foul-mouthed Nikita Krushchev sent by Stalin to lead the defense of Stalingrad further adds to the pictures uncertain dramatic tone. Apart from a lazy uninspired score by James Horner tech credits are genuinely impressive with production design by Wolf Kroeger that convincingly creates a wintry Beirut-like landscape of hollow bombed-out buildings lived-in costume design by Janty Yates (""Gladiator"") muted widescreen lensing by Robert Fraisse that cuts easily between claustrophobic closeups and large exteriors and makeup that is convincingly under-the-fingernails in its dirt and grime. A brief animated sequence after the main titles in which the location is described like a hectoring WWII newsreel (""Europe lies crushed beneath the German jackboot ... one last obstacle remains ... Stalingrad"") would be best eliminated in non-U.S. prints especially in Europe.
