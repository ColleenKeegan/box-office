The relentless snark cynicism and satire of MAD added up to something larger -- a way of standing outside the frame of positioning yourself as cheekily superior to whatever was in front of you. But if you were a little kid before you even got to MAD there were the cartoons of Jay Ward Rocky amp; His Friends and its offshoots Fractured Fairy Tales and Peabodys Improbable History. These were the first childrens cartoons maybe ever that had the media-age cleverness to lampoon their own storytelling their own connect-the-dots whimsicality and cut-rate animation technique and bad puns. When a Peabody cartoon set during say the American Revolution ended with Mr. Peabody saying something like ""Whats the matter Sherman? Havent you ever heard of chicken?catch a Tory?"" it was as much a postmodern rim shot as anything that ever came out of the mouth of Conan OBrien. Characters like Rocky and Bullwinkle and Mr. Peabody were more than just fun ""friends."" They taught a whole generation how to look at the world through a glass ironically. Now of course thats how more people than not look at the world and a great deal of kiddie cartoon culture is one big detached ironic snarkfest. Which means that a movie like Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman even when its genuinely trying to be true to the spirit of the original may have a tricky time recapturing what it was that was so special about the casually insane tossed-off fizziness of Peabody and Shermans four-minute adventures in the WABAC machine. The characters can still climb into that time machine of course but theres simply no going back to an age when Mr. Peabodys brainy quizzicality was novel. Ty Burrell voicing Peabody in the movie gets the characters speedy super-logical rhythms without quite nailing his dry delight. He needed a touch more savoir faire a dash of Tim Gunn. That said over the years there have been a lot of famous kids shows turned into brightly colored dumbed-down movies and Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman by contrast is an agreeably brisk and word-happy entertainment for little ones. If you grew up with Mr. Peabody it doesnt totally recapture the magic of the original but it doesnt leave you feeling cheated either. The movie fills in a lot of stuff that was implicit before -- like for instance Peabodys whole status as a ""genius."" Now hes not just a hyper-articulate dog in a bowtie and round spectacles. Hes a formidable achiever who speaks every language and plays every instrument and is also a world-class chef an Olympic Gold Medalist a licensed chiropractor a state-of-the-art mixologist (favorite drink Einstein on the Beach) and a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who advises heads of state. In addition hes the doting father of an adoptive human son the orange-haired and ordinary Sherman (voiced by Max Charles). The attempt to give their relationship a backstory (complete with a montage accompanied by John Lennons ""Beautiful Boy"") and a core of ""feeling"" may have been necessary to sustain a feature-length film but I cringed just a bit at hearing Sherman say ""I love you Mr. Peabody"" because the whole camaraderie of these two -- a smart-mouth geek of a dog as father to an earnest geek of a boy? Sure -- is better when its left completely deadpan and unexplained. The plot has Mr. Peabody Sherman and Shermans mean-girl antagonist at school Penny (Ariel Winter) skipping around in time and landing in three major historical epochs ancient Egypt where Penny becomes the beau of King Tut; the Italian Renaissance where our gang helps Leonardo Da Vinci put the smile on the Mona Lisa and then takes a perilous action ride in Da Vincis fabulous flying machine (Sherman ""grows"" out of his youthful anxiety when hes persuaded to take the controls); and the Trojan War with burly goofy soldiers who might have stepped out of a standard DreamWorks cartoon. Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman has a zesty time mixing and matching historical figures from Marie Antoinette to George Washington. Yet the movie never to my mind conjured quite the quirky effervescence of such brainiac animated features as the Jimmy Neutron or SpongeBob SquarePants movies. Back in his day Mr. Peabody was a dog whose over-civility had bite. Now hes a genius you want to cuddle with.

All Rights Reserved. First the pleasant surprises. In puffing up the slight absurd Mr. Peabody and Sherman shorts from Jay Wards The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show into an 82-minute 3D save-the-timestream child-distractor director Rob Minkoff and his many writers have preserved a few of the hallmarks distinguishing the Dada deadpan almost primitive original a toon so flat it was almost less than 2D. The structure remains episodic visiting the French Revolution Renaissance Italy and ancient Egypt; genius beagle Mr. Peabody still caps each escapade in history with a proudly terrible pun; and the whole thing has an amiable gag-to-gag vibe for most of the first hour. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Many of those gags are godawful Sherman Mr. Peabodys human boy companion points out that ""King Tut"" rhymes with ""butt"" and that ""booby-trap""has the word ""booby"" in it. Some dont even seem to be gags exactly but vague notes toward punch lines the writers maybe meant to add later Shermans new bully/galpal/adventure buddy Penny heading off to marry a pharaoh proclaims ""I want a big fat Egyptian wedding."" And a handful are killer as when Peabody as the god Ra addresses the people in the Valley of the Kings telling them that wedding is off and they wont get their deposits back on the catering. (Ty Burrell who voices Peabody finds some glory in the rote.) That Egypt sequence boasts a trapped-tomb adventure better than anything in the last Indiana Jones picture and before that theres an oddly moving montage detailing the title duos relationship set to John Lennons ""Beautiful Boy."" (No word on why they dont Wayback to Central Park West 1980 and divert Mark David Chapman.) But the movie labors hammily to get us worried about problems in that relationship and its more committed to chasing the now than to finding laughs in the past -- in the first two minutes distinguished Peabody makes cracks about Zumba planking yoga poses and methane cow farts and then throws in silly dancing the imperturbable authority figure from TV cartoons coming on as desperate as Al Jolson to win love in the movies. Its the first time Ive seen flop sweat on a dog. By the end dog and boy are zipping about interminably trying to stop yet another pixels-in-the-sky doomsday with the usual shouted-on-the-fly movie science -- all as they learn to love and trust each other again. More puns less story please.

Remember the big-screen versions of ""Boris and Natasha"" with Sally Kellerman and Dave Thomas? Brendan Fraser as ""Dudley Do-Right"" and ""George of the Jungle""? Robert DeNiro as Fearless Leader in ""Rocky amp; Bullwinkle""? Yes I know. Ive been trying to forget too. Which is why ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" -- based on Wards deliciously silly cartoon about a coolly intellectual talking dog his geeky boy and their time-machine trips through history -- is such a pleasant mostly faithful surprise. Its been given the full modern treatment by DreamWorks Animation and thats not quite an endorsement. The 3D the softened computer images the occasional bathroom jokes the well-worn pop song in the middle -- all feel like their trademarked style by now. But the film also has the original shows spirit and some of its old-fashioned charm. The set-up for the old cartoon was that the superior Mr. Peabody and nerdy Sherman would take a trip back to some crucial historical moment; things would inevitably go wrong Mr. Peabody would save the day and it would all end with a groan-worthy pun. The movie replicates that only now having several separate trips -- to Troy the French Revolution ancient Egypt and the Renaissance -- strung together with a linking story which has Sherman trying to make friends at school and a social worker challenging Mr. Peabodys parental custody. Its a lot of material and although Sherman and Mr. Peabody are fine the rendering of the supporting characters falls back on some computer-animation cliches -- spindly limbs big flat feet and for the bad guys chins like battering rams. But Ty Burrell who voices Mr. Peabody does a truly wonderful job. There was always something a little foppish about that beagle with his little red tie and bachelor pad; Burrell gives him just the right amount of cosmopolitan snide somewhere between Tony Randall and Clifton Webb. And although a few other guest voices show up briefly -- including Allison Janney and Stephen Colbert -- the movie doesnt go overboard with celebrity drop-bys. In fact most of the rest of the heavy lifting is done by 10-year-old Max Charles who does an excellent job of making Sherman sound like a real somewhat overexcited boy. The script to its credit also avoids the usual DreamWorks fallback of shoveling in pop-culture jokes whenever possible; although theres a brief ""Spartacus"" gag much of the humor comes from Mr. Peabodys painful puns and a fractured view of history. And director Rob Minkoff -- who also helmed ""The Lion King"" and ""Stuart Little"" -- moves things along briskly. Actually too briskly for my taste; whatever the period whatever the crisis every segment ends with an all-out Spielberg-esque chase with breakneck turns hairbreadth escapes and always-soaring music. Its a little exhausting. Fifty years ago animated entertainment was a lot quieter. But that was my ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman."" This is someone elses. And it should give them and even a few open-minded parents almost just as much giggly fun. Ratings note The film contains some mildly rude humor. Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman (PG) Fox (92 min.) Directed by Rob Minkoff. With the voices of Ty Burrell Max Charles Stephen Colbert Allison Janney.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 07 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Mar. 07 2014 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Rob Minkoff Written by Craig Wright Starring The voices of Ty Burrell and Max Charles Classification G Country USA Language English Theres a font of smart-alecky pop culture silliness that originated from Jay Ward Productions animation studios in the late 1950s and early sixties including the characters of Rocky and Bullwinkle Boris and Natasha George of the Jungle and Dudley Do-Right. One of these featured on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show was a series of five-minute cartoons Peabodys Improbable History featuring the genius beagle Mr. Peabody and his adopted human son Sherman who travel through time in their WABAC machine make bad puns and learn history lessons from famous people. As well as reinventing the story in 3-D the creators have attempted to do the same for the characters adding emotional depth and a redeeming message in a story of a canine father (voiced by Modern Familys Ty Burrell) learning to love his son better while society learns tolerance for different kinds of blended families. Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman is the first completely animated feature from director Rob Minkoff (Stuart Little) since The Lion King though apart from a theme of paternity and high vantage points the films have little in common. Visually this is strictly DreamWorks The Manhattan setting looks like a sixties version of the future with bright-coloured rubber-toy characters and clean geometric backdrops. Mr. Peabody is fast-paced and jammed with rib-poking historical references but it couldnt be called witty even on the broadly winking level of the original cartoon.The movie begins with a shot of the New York skyline featuring Mr. Peabodys own glass-box-in-the-sky modernist home as he expounds his accomplishments as inventor master chef fencing expert and Harvard ""valedogtorian."" Fussy and self-important hes borderline insufferable though its a saving grace that when provoked he loses his sang-froid and reverts to his canine nature growling and even biting. And he has a soft spot for the kid he adopted as we learn in a mawkish montage scored to John Lennons Beautiful Boy outlining the story of how he found and adopted the orphan Sherman.On Shermans first day of school his know-it-all behaviour earns him the enmity of the cute but mean Penny (Ariel Winter also from Modern Family). After the two have a scrap the authorities are called in and the large booming-voiced social worker Miss Grunion (Allison Janney) is disgusted with the idea that a dog can be a parent and is determined to investigate. Mr. Peabody anxious to resolve the issue invites both Grunion and Penny and her parents (Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann) to his condo for some gourmet hospitality cocktails and free chiropractic treatment.Meanwhile Sherman tries to impress Penny by showing her the WABAC machine They zoom off to Egypt where she decides shed like to marry the boy King Tut. Sherman rushes back to get Mr. Peabodys help and the dog hypnotizes his dinner guests and races back in time. In the convoluted plot one trip leads to another from the Renaissance with Leonardo Da Vinci (Stanley Tucci) to the siege of Troy where the dog and boy find themselves in the Trojan horse with King Agamemnon (Patrick Warburton) getting his Greek team pumped for the big game.What is initially just convoluted becomes wildly manic in the final third after Sherman breaks the rule of travelling back in his own lifetime The space-time continuum has been ripped and something resembling the climax of Ghostbusters seems to have been unleashed as things explode lights flash and historical characters wander the streets of New York. Parents will get the historical jokes but are unlikely to be amused; kids wont get them but might laugh anyway.

Daily Edition Login to download Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman Film Review 1000 AM PST 2/2/2014 by Leslie Felperin FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Hardly a dog of a movie but DreamWorks latest 3D cartoon is mawkish even for a kids film and takes its time to get going. TWITTER Rob Minkoff director of the ""Stuart Little"" films and co-helmer for ""The Lion King"" casts Ty Burrell and Ariel Winter in this reboot of characters first introduced over 60 years ago. Featuring a hyperintelligent talking time-traveling dog and his boy 3D cartoon Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman represents a pleasant polished but somewhat by-the-numbers effort a throat-clearing exercise to kick off 2014 for DreamWorks Animation before they blitzkrieg the box office with How to Train Your Dragon 2 in June. The studio must surely be hoping to claw back some market share after such disappointing performers as Rise of the Guardians and Turbo but this is effectively a gamble on an unknown brand given it reprises characters largely unfamiliar to viewers outside of North America. Even in that territory only middle-aged parents grandparents and die-hard animation geeks will remember the four-and-a-half minute Peabodys Improbable History skits that were bundled together with segments featuring the more-famous eponymous heroes of The Rocky amp; Bullwinkle Show first broadcast in 1959. Here screenwriter Craig Wright (Six Feet Under) and director Rob Minkoff (Stuart Little The Lion King The Haunted Mansion) pay homage to the spirit of the original Saturday-morning shorts with puns a plenty and history-based high jinks. Unfortunately somebody somewhere decided they needed to pile the sentimentality on thick as birthday cupcake frosting even if its pro-adoption pro-unconventional-family message is laudable. VIDEO 5 Top Animators on the Good and Bad of Celebrity Voices and Creative Input From Their Own Kids It was probably inevitable that given the demands of feature length and modern expectations for family entertainment the decision would be taken to flesh out the literally sketchy characters created by Ted Key for producer Jay Wards cartoon variety show and graft on a homiletic emotional arc. Although a cursory rifle through YouTube will prove that Wright and Minkoff have been largely faithful to the origin story of how clever canine Mr. Peabody came to adopt orphan Sherman this 2014 iteration makes a much bigger meal out of the whole thing. Spinning out plot that took all of three minutes on TV the first 15 minutes of the feature ploddingly explains how after polymath pooch Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell with more deliberation than the rat-a-tat delivery of original voice actor Bill Scott) becomes a father to orphan Sherman (Max Charles). Although the opening montage shows how Peabody set a judicial precedent with the cross-species adoption and makes every effort to promote Shermans education -- especially with the help of the WABAC their time-travel machine -- he remains a formal emotionally reserved parent responding to Shermans profession of love with a clipped ""I have a deep regard for you as well."" No prizes for guessing that teaching Peabody about good parenting will be a major theme but its a move that sacrifices the whimsy that so charmed in the original series. Back in the old days Peabody and Sherman went off to meet the likes of the Marquis of Queensbury or Galileo in a spirit of larky adventurousness saved them from making foolish mistakes and always got home in time for the final punning-punchline. Borrowing from the classic time-travel movie playbook the feature motivates action almost entirely through contrived dangers posed by meddlesome outside forces. The first and foremost threat to their happiness is social worker Miss Grunion (voiced by Allison Janney) a battle-ax busybody who believes that a dog ""could never be a suitable parent for a little boy."" Perhaps her prejudice is meant to be taken simply on face value but its not hard to read an occluded homophobia into her disgust with Shermans adoption by Peabody especially since the fussy bow-tied bachelor beagle has a slightly effeminate air about him reminiscent of old-fashioned gay stereotypes. This subtextual reading is bolstered further in the films climactic emotional moment when Sherman appropriates an insult hurled at him earlier (someone calls him a dog) and turns it into a badge of pride recalling the jujitsu rebranding of the word ""queer."" That insult the instigating action which serves as the crux of the story comes first from Penny Peterson (Ariel Winter who plays Burrells daughter in Modern Family) a hyper-competitive classmate of Shermans who manages to rile the boy so badly with verbal bullying he bites her bringing down the wrath of both Miss Grunion and Pennys parents (Leslie Mann and Stephen Colbert). When the Paterson family comes over to Peabody and Shermans house for dinner to try make peace Sherman disobeys his dad and uses the WABAC to prove to Penny how he knows that George Washington never chopped down a cherry tree. And so begins an adventure through history that starts in ancient Egypt with Penny getting betrothed to 9-year-old tyrant King Tut (Zach Callison) and carries on through encounters with Leonardo Da Vinci (Stanley Tucci) and Agamemnon (Patrick Warburton) on the eve of the sacking of Troy amongst others. (Rather sweetly Mel Brooks whose 2000-year-old man character tapped the same zeitgeist as the original Peabody sketches has a cameo as Albert Einstein.) The action climax involving that old favorite a rupture in the space-time continuum ties things up with a noisy enough amount of action to satisfy less critical younger viewers but some might find the denouement a bit too perfunctory. More troubling still is the thinness of some of the characterizations especially the Aryan-featured Penny who starts out as a stone-cold mean girl is barely given backstory to make her sympathetic causes nothing but trouble and then too-abruptly becomes Shermans love interest and friend. More cynical observers might postulate that shes there mostly to add a female presence to the marketing materials lest the film appear too male-skewed. The films saving grace is its character design and use of 3D techniques to speed things up in every sense when the plot starts to flag. Minkoff and his animating team have struck a judicious balance between honoring the simplified features of the huge-headed original characters and updating with added dimensionality lighting and a much richer supersaturated color palette. Just by cleverly tweaking the position of eyebrows and mouths theyve coaxed a great deal of expressiveness from the figures who of course move with much more smoothness and plasticity than the limited animation figures of the early 60s a style that modern audiences just wont swallow any more. All in all a nice humming tension is maintained here between retro design elements child-friendly antics and contemporary references aimed at grownups gags that go from autocue to Zumba. Thankfully there arent so many that they become a distraction as they did in the later installments of the Shrek franchise. Whether it will sell to kids especially in trickier offshore territories will all be down to word of mouth in the school yards although timing the release in Europe to coincide with the half-term breaks most kids have in February is a canny move especially since by now most parents couldnt face seeing Disneys Frozen many more times.

It was Samuel Butler who wrote of dogs that ""you may make a fool of yourself with him and not only will he not scold you but he will make a fool of himself too."" He did not reckon with the prissy annoyingly infallible canine hero of ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman."" Swift peppy and defiantly unendearing DreamWorks latest toon updates the zany adventures of the time-traveling dog-and-his-boy sideshow from Jay Wards 1960s TV series ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" -- an arcane starting point for contempo kiddie fare and not one that adapts entirely comfortably to the studios blend of state-of-the-art imagery and touchy-feely personal issues. Though the pic is sufficiently bright and gag-laden to lure families in a release frame short on comparable distractions its commercial legs will depend on how readily tots accept its bizarre premise. The films release in Blighty on Feb. 7 precedes its U.S. opening by a month -- a surprising strategy considering how many of its elements from the source material to the lead vocal presence of ""Modern Family"" star Ty Burrell are identifiable principally to American audiences. The ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" characters may seem dated even to accompanying parents though the film cleverly addresses the problem by locating the modern-day narrative in a New York nonetheless laden with 60s retro styling -- from Mr. Peabodys Jetsons-meets-Philip Johnson dream house to the pairs natty Coke-bottle spectacles -- that cannily evokes the rubberized chic of Pixars ""The Incredibles."" The design will reassure any nostalgia-chasing fans of the original series that theyre in an equivalent universe as will the scripts fondness for the knowingly lame punnery that was Wards comic stock-in-trade; the pre-credit sequence alone exhausts the verbal possibilities of the word ""dog."" (The revelation that our canine genius graduated ""valedogtorian"" is as witty as it gets.) In most other respects however the rules of this story world have been rather dramatically altered. Wards creation treated as a jaunty absurdity the concept of a talking dog with an adopted human son and a time machine named the WABAC With the freakishly intelligent Mr. Peabody treating doltish schoolboy Sherman more like a pet than a son (like the power play between Charlie Brown and Snoopy taken to surreal extremes) it wasnt a setup played for emotional truth. Written by playwright and TV stalwart Craig Wright (""Six Feet Under"" ""Dirty Sexy Money"") ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" offers a slicker sweeter take on the idea adding a wholesome dose of family values to the central relationship -- complete with syrupy montage scored to John Lennons ""Beautiful Boy"" detailing just how this strange adoption came to pass. Peabody (Burrell) a beagle-like pooch whose precocious humanoid behavior left him unclaimed at the puppy farm finds the infant Sherman (Max Charles) abandoned in an alleyway takes him in and raises him as his own. ""If a boy can adopt a dog"" a judge reasons ""I see no reason why a dog cant adopt a boy."" Very young viewers may take a similarly diplomatic view of the situation. Others may find it all a bit disconcerting particularly as the film launches full-throttle into the era-hopping action -- with the aforementioned backstory saved for later the opening setpiece sees Peabody whiz Sherman off to 18th-century Versailles for a firsthand history lesson with Marie Antoinette before weve ascertained the exact relationship between these oddly matched principals. ""Just Go With It"" would have been a suitable alternate title for the film but even those who take these outlandish goings-on at face value may be thrown when were invited to invest in the psychological reality of this father-son bond. When Sherman starts elementary school the skepticism of his fellow students -- notably Penny (Ariel Winter) a classroom bully on whom the boy nurses a poorly disguised crush -- arouses enough conflict to draw the villainous attention of gorgon-like social worker Miss Grunion (Allison Janney). The films underlying themes of accepting difference and familial belonging run obviously counter to Grunions fast-held conviction that a dog is no suitable parent for a human boy -- though its hard not to wonder if she has a point and what the real-world equivalency is for the films opposing stance. Its probably best not to think about these things too hard -- which is just as well since the narratives time-travel element allows for plenty of fluffy fleet-footed action particularly when contrived circumstances lead to Sherman and Penny taking the WABAC out for an unsupervised spin. There was presumably a learning-while-playing intent behind the films irreverent whistle-stop tour of assorted historical eras from Ancient Egypt (where Penny is briefly betrothed to King Tut) to Renaissance Italy (where Peabodys pratfalls serve as the inspiration for Mona Lisas smile) though its doubtful young auds will leave the theater with much academic insight -- beyond the knowledge that George Washington is a useful man to have around in the middle of a space-time continuum crisis. Its worth noting that this is director Rob Minkoffs first fully animated feature since ""The Lion King"" though he hasnt carried much old-school Disney texture over to the familiar DreamWorks house style. With Oscar-winning cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (""Pans Labyrinth"") on board as a visual consultant the animation retains the wonky proportions and elastic movement of the original cartoons though with a lushly expanded palette and a now-requisite airbrushed finish that hampers expressivity in the case of certain characters. (The 3D is sleek and with the exception of a few thrusting swords in more historically heated interludes entirely dispensable.) Danny Elfmans score like much else here is zippy in the moment but not especially distinctive. Film Review Mr. Peabody amp; ShermanReviewed at Vue West End London Feb. 1 2014. MPAA Rating PG.

DREAMWORKS ANIMATION BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Mr. Peabody amp; ShermanStarring (the voices of) Ty Burrell Max Charles Ariel Winter Leslie Mann Stephen Colbert Allison Janney Directed by Rob Minkoff Rated PG for some mild action and brief rude humor Running time 1 hour 32 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times for the 3D version and the standard version)The quick hitThe canine genius and his avid adopted son have plenty of wry moments in this 3D feature version of the Ted Key TV shorts ""Peabodys Improbable History"" but the film is overloaded with soap opera and spectacle. Grade B- Did you know that Mr. Peabody the genius pooch and trailblazing time traveler from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon series was once known as ""The Woof of Wall Street?"" That moniker was invented for the opening segment of ""Peabodys Improbable History."" And that would have been a timely pun for the initial scenes of ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" which trots through the first chapters of this billionaire canines life. But the movie isnt nimble enough to include much topical humor and it isnt relaxed enough for casual visual riffs. The movie feels as if its spontaneity has been test-screened out. Peabodys original exploits available on disc and streaming video are composed entirely of comic throwaways. They churn with bits of verbal slapstick like ""Surely youve heard of the Amos and Andes mountains?"" Wild-man sight gags abound. In one segment Columbus ships do nearly tumble off the earth because his wicked navigator steers him toward Victoria Falls. And offhand anachronisms add to their absurdist charm Johannes Gutenberg gets a tip about a fire over an old-fashioned wall phone as he tries to print the worlds first newspaper. But ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" centers wrongheadedly on the hyper-literate hounds soaring love for his adopted son Sherman. The films maudlin climaxes squelch director Rob (""Lion King"") Minkoffs bloated efforts to reproduce the vintage recipes. Minkoff and his main writer Craig Wright stay true to Mr. Peabodys drollery and Shermans piping eagerness. They indulge in a barrage of wordplay (mixing ""mais oui"" and ""may we"" ""the Nile"" and ""Denial""). And they do come up with one magical shot The barge of the Egyptian sun god Ra shoots out from the tail end of the Sphinx. Their destinations for Mr. Peabodys ""WABAC"" machine would fit nicely into ""Peabodys Improbable History"" Versailles on the eve of the French Revolution Troy about to open the gates to a certain man-made horse Leonardo da Vincis studio when hes trying to get a female subject to smile and King Tuts Egypt on the verge of a royal child wedding. Too often though the jokes dont mesh with the mechanical spectacle. Worse the gravity of Mr. Peabodys doggie-daddy issues and Shermans own puppy love for a female frenemy named Penny defang what should be anything-goes humor. ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" frames its picaresque saga with the crusade of a child-services tyrant to cancel Mr. Peabodys right to parent Sherman after the boy bites a goading jealous girl for calling him a dog. (That bite victim is Penny who - incredibly - becomes his boon companion.) After Mr. Peabody wins over Pennys parents with anecdotes and songs and his famous ""Einstein on the Beach"" cocktail he decides that hes been wrong to maintain his distance as a dad. He must say the words fans never thought hed utter ""I love you Sherman"" Gag me with a chew toy. Why do moviemakers presume that every 90-minute entertainment calls for emotional depth? As a child I loved the way ""Peabodys Improbable History"" avoided any mushy stuff even within its offbeat family unit. The up-front silliness of a polymath dog expanding a boys horizons with his WABAC machine does not call for insight into motives or character. Mr. Peabody cut from the same quasi-albino beagle strain as Snoopy in the TV show is a light frolicsome figure drawn in an urbane Sunday-funnies style. The digital 3D animation makes him more ungainly - his leathery black nose the texture of a catchers mitt is always in your face. Characters like Mr. Peabody and Sherman demand something more flexible and airy a genuine hand-drawn comic artists line. Todays other cartoon-feature opening ""Ernest amp; Celestine"" proves how charming and expressive old-fashioned rendering can be. The set pieces establish Mr. Peabody as an unflappable Sherlock Hound-like paragon of deduction and daring. Most of the vocal performers are promising from Ty Burrell and Max Charles as Mr. Peabody and Sherman to Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann as Pennys parents. Colbert gets off a characteristic idiotic quip when he refers to a double image of Sherman as ""Dos Shermanos."" I say ""promising"" because we hold out hope for a sequel that will shed the weightiness and schmaltz. To borrow this movies best pun ""If at first you dont succeed Troy Troy again.""

"Review Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman may be too smart for its own good - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman may be too smart for its own good Peabody and Sherman DreamWorks Animation Sherman asks a skeptical Mr. Peabody if he can take control of the WABAC in the animated ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman."" Sherman asks a skeptical Mr. Peabody if he can take control of the WABAC in the animated ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman."" (DreamWorks Animation) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic In that ever-expanding world of kid/grown-up movies ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" reveals a case of conflicted allegiances.While the characters from the beloved Rocky and Bullwinkle shows of the 1960s mixed arch intelligence with kid confusion to the delight of the Saturday-morning cartoon crowd a generation ago the big-screen adventure is more Adult Swim than Saturday morning. Those are treacherous waters to tread. The film is 3-D but you barely notice that extra D. Its filled with the sort of erudite discourse that befits Mr. Peabody the genius dog with a genius choice for a voice in ""Modern Familys"" Ty Burrell whose delivery is dry to the bone.The story is ""Modern Family""-friendly in other ways. Mr. Peabody is reimagined as an actual rather than implied father to the young boy Sherman (Max Charles). Its an adoption situation one that is suddenly in jeopardy a theme that drives the film. The explanation of why a canine could adopt a boy in the first place is none too subtle in suggesting contemporary dilemmas. BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenWe get the back story of Sherman found as an abandoned baby by the brilliant beagle along with a laundry list of Mr. Peabodys many accomplishments Harvard degree inventor business titan mixologist... Though maybe that last talent is saved for later. It serves as a setup for anyone unfamiliar with the basic conceit -- the dog is the superior being -- and a mechanism to explain the changes made in moving from short TV segment to main big-screen attraction.The unwieldy opening also exemplifies the films central difficulty in finding the right balance between riffing on the cultural zeitgeist for adults and seeding in enough silliness for kids. Its a problem that increasingly seems to be systemic to DreamWorks animated films as the studio struggles to take the formula that made ""Shrek"" such a success in 2001 and play it forward.Director Rob Minkoff who was behind the mildly amusing animation/live-action mix of ""Stuart Little"" and screenwriter Craig Wright whose credits include the very smart HBO series ""Six Feet Under"" have captured the characters fundamental je ne sais quoi in sometimes delightful ways. And they clearly understand the need to reach the kid quotient. Theres a smattering of harmless scatological sight gags likely to make everyone giggle. The Trojan horse is the funniest helped by Patrick Warburtons odoriferous Agamemnon.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013The animation style mirrors the original which is simple in an appealing way. It is particularly effective in the action sequences which make the most of animations ability to create a playful reality. But the multi-layered historical references designed to be adroitly wry are a trickier gambit.Rarely do I feel inclined to say this but the film may actually be too smart for its own good. Many of Mr. Peabodys ""teaching moments"" will sail right over the heads of kids while requiring adults to pay attention. Shermans frequent reaction --""Huh? I dont get it"" -- will likely be echoed by many youngsters in the audience.As it happens being ""too smart"" is Shermans problem at school too. After all the pre-school educating Mr. Peabody has been doing Sherman is in the unfortunate position of knowing too much. By outsmarting the smartest girl in class on the first day the boy makes a formidable enemy.Voiced by another ""Modern Family"" member Ariel Winter Pennys lunchroom taunting leads to Sherman acting out and before you know it an officious female from Family Services named Miss Grunion (Allison Janney) is threatening to take the boy away.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVThe rest of the film follows the misadventures that begin when Mr. Peabody invites Penny and her parents (Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann) over for dinner in hopes the youngsters can work through their issues.Instead they take their competing egos along with them in the WABAC machine Mr. Peabodys time-traveling invention. Finally the film gets its footing. Time travel allows the kids with Mr. Peabodys assistance to have clever fun at historys expense Smile Mona Lisa smile.But the underlying 21st century issues -- what makes a good parent what makes a family how can a friendship between feuding kids be forged -- seem relatively rote. For all the ways the film reflects its earlier TV incarnation the shadings have been softened.

The film starts very much like the cartoons did In a luxurious penthouse apartment high above New York City Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell) a dog in glasses interrupts his yoga session to introduce himself to us. Hes a Harvard graduate a Nobel laureate a captain of industry and an inventor of some repute. (Peabodys inventions are a bit more up-to-date this time around He gave us the fist-bump Auto-Tune tearaway pants and Zumba.) Then he introduces us to his son Sherman (Max Charles) an ordinary-seeming boy whom Peabody adopted after finding him abandoned in a dark alley. Peabody is unwilling to show base emotions -- when the boy says he loves him the dog replies ""I have a high regard for you as well"" -- but he is fond of his son and ""to prepare him for all the wonders of the world present and past"" hes built them a time machine called the WABAC machine (appropriately pronounced as ""wayback"") which they use to travel throughout time and learn about history. This was the basic plot of Peabodys Improbably History which ran back in the day as part of the generally surreal (and stoner-friendly) Rocky amp; Bullwinkle Show. And so Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman while updating the basic concept with CG animation and occasionally more topical humor (""Dont tase me bro"" King Agamemnon pleads with modern-day cops after they zap Robespierre down to the ground) sticks to that basic outline. Even the wordplay and puns are back. (""You cant have your cake and edict too"" said about the likelihood of Marie Antoinette redistributing wealth is one of the better ones.) The plot feels not unlike something out of Bill amp; Teds Excellent Adventure Sherman uses the WABAC to go back in time to impress a girl they travel through the ages and get in trouble and before we know it theres a rip in the space-time continuum and history starts literally raining down from the skies of New York. Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman is slight but its exceedingly charming making good use of a talented voice cast that includes Stephen Colbert Leslie Mann Mel Brooks as Freud and Stanley Tucci as Leonardo Da Vinci. (And Im always happy to hear Patrick Warburton whose Kronk in The Emperors New Groove is still the greatest vocal performance ever in an animated film.) Even the obligatory emotional stuff works reasonably well One montage goes progressively further back in time as Peabody flashes back to Shermans early years part of the joke being that hes also flashing back through history as he does so; at one point we see Baby Sherman and Baby Moses together in the waters of the Nile.A But at times its hard not to wonder who this movie is for. Kids today are pretty sharp but you have to ask yourself how far a film can go with high-level pun-based humor (see the edict example above) and jokes about Agamemnon and Oedipus or even time-space continuum gags until the young ones are squirming in their seats. The films finale heavy on the effects and the anachronistic gags seems to partly acknowledge this by not trying too hard to make all the time-travel jokes make sense Its all mostly gobbledygook; but again it takes being a certain age to understand that it is gobbledygook and not to get confused. Most kids movies today have to appeal to adults to some degree as well in order to become genuine hits. And so they toss adults a bone here and there an edgy joke or two above the kids heads or hidden emotional subtexts that resonate with parents. The best ones of course manage to give us lenticular gags that work one way for kids and another way for adults; The LEGO Movie is supernaturally good at this. Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman feels at times like the opposite of other animated films As I chuckled and grinned my way through it I started to wonder when it was going to throw the kids a bone.A Tagsmoviesmr. peabody and shermanmovie review Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Winona Ryder and the Power of Meta-Casting 8 Essential PokA(c)mon Go Tips Youall Want to Know Mike Birbigliaas Quest to Create Comedy of Communion Most Viewed Stories Constance Wu Slams Matt Damonas Great Wall Film for Perpetuating a aRacist Mytha 40k Shares Share Tweet LeBron James Reportedly Stopped Justin Bieber From Performing at the RNC 93 Shares Share Tweet John C.

"Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman a fun blast through the past Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMr. Peabody amp; Sherman a fun blast through the past ReviewMr. Peabody and Sherman successfully resurrects a 60s animated classic with great visuals including 3-D with a lighthearted story. Sherman voiced by Max Charles right and Mr. Peabody voiced by Ty Burell in a scene from DreamWorks latest movie.  (Dreamworks)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. March 6 2014Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman Starring the voices of Ty Burrell Max Charles and Ariel Winter. Directed by Rob Minkoff. 92 minutes. Opens March 7 at major theatres. G.Its a tale about a dog and his boy.Derived from a segment called Peabodys Improbable History on the old Rocky and Bullwinkle Show which ran from 1959 to 1964 the people at DreamWorks Animation hope to strike box office gold by plumbing the past.Article Continued BelowPrevious efforts including the Dudley Do-Right movie in 1999 as well as The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle in 2000 -- which featured live actors alongside the animated title characters -- were not particularly successful from a critical or audience perspective.This one is likely to be a different story for a number of reasons.The film takes much from the original including the fact that the much accomplished know-it-all canine -- Nobel prize laureate etc. -- is a little emotionally detached.He prefers his young charge Sherman to rather formally call him Mr. Peabody rather than Dad and has a hard time saying the L word preferring instead to express his ""deep regard"" for his adopted son.The Sherman of the present is much preferable to the one of yesteryear who was a bit of witless cipher. This one is far better fleshed out as a 7-year-old boy with genuine emotions and a childs propensity to not necessarily do everything theyre told. The story also includes most critically the WABAC time machine which creates the impetus for the pairs high-camp adventures through the ages. Not surprisingly the animation by DreamWorks is light years ahead of the original rudimentary cartoon. With its 3-D effects the film is a visual delight from start to finish. The characters are rendered in an exaggerated way that is both playful and amusing. Shermans big brown eyes and slightly rounded front teeth are downright endearing and Mr. Peabodys bright green eyes glint with intelligence.The plot is clean and simple involving a naughty classmate of Shermans named Penny whose troublemaking leads to the intervention of Mrs. Grunion a maniacal social worker named who threatens to separate the two main characters. When Sherman tries to turn her into a friend he breaks the taboo of using the time machine without Mr. Peabody present resulting in a riotous ride through history including stops in ancient Troy and Egypt and the Renaissance and some unexpected mayhem.Craig Wrights screenplay has a number of off-colour bodily function-related jokes for the youngsters but more than enough wit to appeal to adults. Theres some fine voice work by Ty Burrell as Mr. Peabody Max Charles as Sherman and Patrick Warburton as Agamemnon among others.Youngsters arent going to get much in the way of an education since the historical sequences -- like the original cartoon -- are played for laughs not accuracy.Still kids of all ages are sure to enjoy this visually splendid fast-paced blast through the past.

Photo Credit DreamWorks Animation advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The adventures of a time-traveling dog and his faithful boy. Rated PG (rude humor). BOTTOM LINE More for kids than adults unlike the cheeky 1960s cartoons but the movie offers enough sly humor and tender moments to please everyone. CAST Voices of Ty Burrell Max Charles Ariel Winter LENGTH 122 For decades fans of the late animator Jay Ward have watched Hollywood transform his roughly drawn but sly-humored television cartoons into duds. From 1997s barely passable ""George of the Jungle"" starring Brendan Fraser to 2000s disastrous ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" featuring Robert De Niro the movies have generally been so dumbed down that they resemble Wards witty creations in name only. The computer-animated ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" is a major improvement. Like the original cartoon segments (created by Ted Key for Wards ""The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show"") the feature-length movie centers on a brilliant inventor Peabody (a vaguely beagle-ish dog) and his adopted human son Sherman. As they travel through time using Peabodys WABAC machine -- no longer a room-sized mess of dials and gauges but a sleek red orb -- the movie has trouble stitching together disjointed episodes into a coherent narrative. Thanks to a strong voice cast however the characters retain their charm throughout. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Ty Burrell of ABCs ""Modern Family"" is an aural ringer for original voice actor Bill Scott as Peabody a finicky genius with a fondness for tortured puns (""You cant have your cake and edict too"" he says after visiting Marie Antoinette). In this telling Sherman voiced by 10-year-old Max Charles invites his bored classmate Penny (Ariel Winter also from ""Modern Family"") into the WABAC resulting in a series of misadventures. Theyll encounter a slap-happy Leonardo da Vinci (Stanley Tucci) a knuckle-headed Agamemnon (Patrick Warburton) and other historical persons. Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann play Pennys present-day parents. Director Rob Minkoff (""The Lion King"") and writer Craig Wright rely a bit too much on body-function humor but they also show us the tender bond between dog and boy. Theres something timely about this nontraditional family made legal in an amusing scene by an activist judge (Dennis Haysbert). Allison Janney as the school principal Miss Grunion provides the voice of societal disapproval. The movies most Ward-worthy sequence unfolds in ancient Egypt when Peabody must stop Pennys wedding to King Tut. The jokes sound like vintage Mad magazine (""But we already paid for the catering"") and the whole high-energy episode ends with one of Peabodys dependable groaners. ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" cant sustain that pace throughout but the movie admirably -- even doggedly -- tries. 230 MoviesMr. Peabody and Sherman trailer PLOT The adventures of a time-traveling dog and his faithful boy. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (rude humor) CAST Voices of Ty Burrell Max Charles Ariel Winter LENGTH 122 BOTTOM LINE More for kids than adults unlike the cheeky 1960s cartoons but the movie offers enough sly humor and tender moments to please everyone. MoviesThe best animated films ever made ----- Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff ROCKY FLICKS SQUIRRELED AWAY THE LAUGHS Lets set the WABAC machine to 1959 when Mr. Peabody and Sherman debuted on ""Rocky and His Friends"" Jay Wards animated Cold War spoof about Rocky the flying squirrel his dimwitted moose pal Bullwinkle and Eastern European spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. Lets hope the new ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" movie fares better than earlier big-screen efforts with ""Rocky"" characters. BORIS AND NATASHA (1992) -- Dave Thomas (""SCTV"") and Sally Kellerman starred as the bunglers who defected to America to capture a time-reverse microchip. Missing in this pot of borscht were Rocky and Bullwinkle because the production company could not secure the rights to those characters. Lucky them. DUDLEY DO-RIGHT (1999) -- Another popular ""Rocky"" segment revolved around inept Mountie Dudley (here played by Brendan Fraser) his sweetheart Nell and mustache-twirling villain Snidely Whiplash. Blame Canada for the weak attempts at humor (""Scientists discover that Canadian bacon is ordinary ham""). More like Dudley Done Wrong. Movies26 movies we cant stop watching THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY amp; BULLWINKLE (2002) -- Joe Pesci Danny DeVito Cher and Meryl Streep were considered for Boris and Natasha but Jason Alexander and Rene Russo got the parts. Even with Robert De Niro as Fearless Leader and June Foray again voicing Rocky the film was a bigger fumble than a dropped ball at the Wossamotta U. game. advertisement | advertise on newsday -- Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Michael OSullivan March 6 2014 Its possible I suppose that some children may find things to like about ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman."" The animated feature about a time-traveling dog with a genius IQ and his human companion has even more than the recommended daily allowance of scatological humor and B.O. jokes for the average 8-year-old. Anyone much older than that -- and certainly anyone who remembers the cartoons on which the film is based which ran as segments accompanying Jay Wards Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons -- is in for a big disappointment. Despite an updated CGI animation style the movie has all the superficial attributes of the 1959-64 series but none of the charm. Both revolve around a boy named Sherman; his canine master Peabody; a time machine; and bad puns. Yet by visual standards alone the characters rendered in eye-popping 3-D resemble nothing so much as Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade floats. Theyre just as lifeless and inexpressive too. This is especially odd considering that writer Craig Wright and director Rob Minkoff go to great lengths to flesh out the characters back stories and devote inordinate attention and energy to what is presented in the film as the father-son relationship between talking beagle Peabody (voice of Ty Burrell) and Sherman (Max Charles) the human child he lives with. While its true that in the original series Peabody legally ""adopted"" Sherman anyone who has seen the old show can tell you that the relationship between the two was closer to pet ownership than paternal custody. Portraying Sherman as Peabodys legal dependent instead of as his slightly dimwitted best friend not only violates the spirit of the original series but also is just plain weird. ""Peabodys Improbable History"" as the television segments were called was an irreverent even subversively educational romp through famous moments in history. The new film is a sappy comedy about the difficulties of contemporary parenting. Sure the plot superficially hops around in time -- from the French Revolution to ancient Egypt to the Italian Renaissance to the Trojan War -- but its main narrative has less to do with history than with the headaches of single fatherhood when your child is an idiot. Sherman sets the story in motion by letting his classmate Penny (voiced by Burrells ""Modern Family"" castmate Ariel Winter) use the time machine known as the WABAC despite Peabodys express instructions not to. In short order Penny gets stuck in Egypt where she is betrothed to the boy king Tutankhamun (Zach Callison) forcing Peabody and Sherman to rescue her. A subplot about the dangers of disrupting the space-time continuum only muddies the narrative and will upset even the most open-minded aficionado of cinematic time-travel conventions. The question then is Who is this movie for? Certainly not baby boomers who grew up with the series and who probably only came to fully grasp its wordplay and wit when they were adults. Their teeth will likely be set on edge by the aggressively lowbrow nature of the script. But what strange child cares about jokes referencing the 1999 film ""Runaway Bride"" or Bill Clintons dalliance with Monica Lewinsky? Thats right Mom and Dad the 42nd president pops up here to remind your child about that 1990s sex scandal. The off-color allusion is the only time the film goes quite this far but its emblematic of the films inability to strike the right tone. Good luck explaining it on the way home. Then again you might not have to. If there are as few laughs as there were at the screening I sat through that nasty little innuendo might fly right over Juniors head. In that sense at least ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" does resemble the original cartoon which always packed more gags into it than any child could be expected to understand. The difference is that with ""Peabodys Improbable History"" you had to grow up to get all of the humor which ran from silly puns to more slyly sophisticated -- if family-friendly -- double entendres. With ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" youll need not only your own WABAC machine but also a shower.  PG. At area theaters. Contains mild action and rude humor. 82 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Area theaters. Considering the low standard Hollywood sets for kid flicks any animated film that can fairly be described as ""not bad"" is likely to get interest from desperate parents. Move up to ""pretty good"" and suddenly the whole familys got reason to celebrate. Somewhere between those poles is the passably clever distraction of ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman."" Director Rob Minkoff and writer Craig Wright were inspired by ""Peabodys Improbable History"" the 1960s TV cartoons packaged with ""The Rocky amp; Bullwinkle Show."" Created by Ted Key they offered dry wit some loosely historical adventures and a couple of groan-inducing puns. Sherman and Mr. Peabody at the controls of the WABAC machine which takes them way back in time. As you may remember Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell) is a brilliant beagle who has adopted a kid named Sherman (Max Charles). Mr. Peabody believes every dog should have a boy but this unusual arrangement outrages child welfare worker Ms. Grunion (Allison Janney). When Sherman gets into a nasty fight with fellow first-grader Penny (Ariel Winter) Ms. Grunion threatens to take him away from Mr. Peabody permanently. Sherman (Max Charles) Penny (Ariel Winter) and Mr. Peabody (Ty Burrell) visit exotic locales in ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman."" In a highly misguided attempt to fix things Sherman and Penny sneak away from the adults (Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann) for a secret ride in Mr. Peabodys WABAC time machine. Naturally the two kids get into plenty of trouble. Penny finds herself engaged to the future King Tut Sherman winds up fighting alongside Agamemnon (Patrick Warburton). Eventually Albert Einstein (Mel Brooks) and Leonardo da Vinci (Stanley Tucci) have to help them repair the inevitable tear in the time-space continuum. Sherman rides through Manhattan in the sidecar with Mr. Peabody. Burrell doesnt quite capture the wry deadpan of the original but then neither does the movie. Thats okay. The adventures are amusing enough to hold everyones attention while simultaneously delivering some valuable lessons about family loyalty and curiosity. (Dont waste money on an unnecessary 3-D ticket though.) Best of all perhaps is the motivation the film presents to send viewers back to the 60s. Seven-year-olds may not be ready to steer a time machine but they can surely navigate YouTube well enough to meet the original Mr. Peabody himself. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The prospect of a feature-length ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" made me nervous since the Sahara-dry humor that made the old Jay Ward cartoon unique is all but absent from todays animated efforts. The story of the ultra-smart time-traveling dog and his pet boy was introduced as a segment of Wards brilliant ""Rocky amp; Bullwinkle Show"" in the 1960s. And the attempt to turn that show into a live-action movie (co-starring Robert De Niro no less) was a catastrophe. Ditto the live-action reboots of Wards ""Dudley Do-Right"" and ""George of the Jungle."" What a relief to see that while ""Mr. Peabodys"" visuals are enhanced to sleek 21st-century standards the essential charm of the series survives more or less intact. In this telling sophisticated sarcastic Peabody an outcast brainiac in his youth adopts human foundling Sherman to give him the family he never had as a pup. A Nobel Prize winner inventor business tycoon and all-around whiz Peabody finds his greatest challenge in raising a child. When Sherman and bratty schoolmate Penny take the WABAC Machine for a joyride they create a rift in the space-time continuum. Peabody takes command as they zip from the French Revolution to ancient Egypt Renaissance Florence and the Trojan War to repair the damage. Theres a romantic triangle involving the children and Egypts boy king Tutankhamen a zoom in Leonardos flying machine and some finger-painting with Vincent Van Gogh before time is put back in joint. These mini-adventures re-create the format of the old cartoons dropping into a bygone epoch to learn a thing or two amid a barrage of sight gags and groan-worthy puns. Some of the archaic jokes are absolute crack-ups. The choice of the actor who voices Albert Einstein is a hoot in itself. Theres a highbrow opera joke so offhand they tell it twice. And you have to love a movie with an ancient Hebrew Egyptian kvetching ""Oy again with the plagues. Why did I ever move here?"" Ty Burrell as Peabody leads a vocal cast including Stephen Colbert Allison Janney Stanley Tucci and Patrick Warburton. Director Rob Minkoff (""The Lion King"") and writer Craig Wright are well aware theyre pitching a lot of jokes over the heads of the littlest viewers. Sherman himself offers a blank-faced ""I dont get it"" after some of Peabodys abstruse witticisms. But theres enough butt-related humor to keep the grade-schoolers in stitches. DreamWorks Animation Sherman (voiced by Max Charles) and Mr. Peabody (Ty Burrell) embark on historical adventures via the WABAC Machine. In the TV show the beagle kept the boy as a pet. That relationship has been revised to introduce a bit of sentimentality. Those with a nose for subtext will also find a thread of innuendo in the notion of prissy confirmed bachelor Peabody winning the courts approval of his unconventional custody arrangement and the efforts of the bigoted social worker trying to take Sherman away. Ultimately Peabodys grandest adventure isnt rescuing Earth from a time-wormhole but easing back on his fatherly perfectionism and letting Sherman find his own way. When the hyper-intelligent dog finally relaxes and wags his tail youll want to tell the filmmakers ""Good boy"" ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Photo DreamWorks Animation Twentieth Century Fox Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman movie review Worthwhile trip back in time 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Ty Burrell Leslie Mann Mel Brooks and Stephen Colbert. Directed by Rob Minkoff. (PG. 92 minutes.) You might need the assistance of a time machine to find a child who is clamoring for a ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" feature film remake. More than many of Jay Wards animation productions the early 1960s cartoons present a high degree of difficulty to stretch into a full-length movie. They were just five minutes long. The wordplay-heavy humor was geared toward adults. And although the cartoons are revered by aging animation fans they havent received the rerun love they deserve in recent years. A series of sound decisions and a few unfortunate ones result in an entertaining but forgettable diversion from DreamWorks Animation. Fans of the original ""Peabodys Improbable History"" shorts that ran on ""The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show"" wont be horribly offended. Parents will appreciate that the bodily functions jokes are kept to a minimum. Little kids will enjoy the movie but they like pretty much everything. (See ""The Smurfs 2"") Although the time travel core is intact there are few retro touches in the remake. Genius dog Mr. Peabody and his adopted son Sherman live in a modern architecture penthouse that you would expect from a tech billionaire. The WABAC machine is no longer a charming series of dials and lights and vacuum tubes - its now a spaceship with a high tech hangar that looks like a collaboration between Tony Stark and Batman. Worst of all Peabody and Sherman are strapped with a first act full of 21st century problems. Needing to fill an extra 85 minutes the filmmakers clumsily explore the characters therapeutic needs. Sherman is bullied at school. Both characters say things they regret in the heat of passion. Peabody has trouble saying ""I love you."" ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" gets much better when the pair go back to the basics Traveling in time and offering a helping hand with history. Leonardo da Vinci King Tut Marie Antoinette and George Washington all make enjoyable cameos. Scenes in the bowels of a Trojan horse with King Agamemnon provide the most comic value. (Thanks once again to Patrick Warburton a first ballot inductee should anyone ever build an Animated Voice Actor Hall of Fame.) Technically ""Peabody"" looks great with plenty of bright and soaring visuals. The ending is a bit of a letdown - yet another ""The Avengers""-esque colorful space vacuum threatening to destroy a big city. But director Rob Minkoff who helped make ""The Lion King"" ably juggles various characters and conflicts to the tidy finish. The late Bill Scott seems irreplaceable as the original voice of Peabody but ""Modern Family"" star Ty Burrell is a sound choice. He conveys intelligence self-satisfaction and just a hint of warmth and gets the cadence of Peabodys swashbuckling linguistics right. Other than a few swordfights the majority of the crises throughout the film are solved by intelligence. One more benefit of ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" The movie is a good excuse to go back and watch the old cartoons created by Ted Key and produced by Ward - many of which are available on YouTube. The shorts hold up well and humor that whooshed right over your tiny head will suddenly make sense. Key and Ward were clearly making these cartoons to entertain themselves.

"Mr. Peabody and Sherman movie review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs REVIEW Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman Contrived family drama drains the fun from the originals premiseMarch 06 2014|Michael PhillipsScene from ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman."" (DreamWorks Animation)We bring to the movies whatever childhoods we had and whatever television we watched to keep real life at bay one half-hour at a time.The frantic occasionally funny new animated feature ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" is a 3-D big-screen version of a defiantly 2-D (if that) and utterly fantastic early 1960s artifact endlessly replayed on television throughout the 70s and beyond. If you want this movie reviewed by somebody with less love for the original try a different review.I was mad for the ""Peabodys Improbable History"" vignettes on ""Rocky amp; His Friends"" later known as ""The Bullwinkle Show."" The multitalented genius beagle Mr. Peabody his boy Sherman their forays into history via the WABAC machine (pronounced ""Way-Back"") the miserable puns the merry swift-paced Stan Freberg-esque treatment of characters ranging from Mata Hari to Genghis Khan -- love love love.Anythings possible. The film written by stage and television regular Craig Wright with additional material (probably the jokes) credited to Michael McCullers may inspire the same kind of love among todays youngfolk. But to perma-fans of the original the movies more a matter of eh eh eh.Director Rob Minkoff who co-directed ""The Lion King"" clearly responded to the sentimental streak in Wrights script which isnt above shameless pathos utterly alien to the original. The rejiggered premise here casts a cold cruel light on the central dog/boy relationship. Sherman is bullied mercilessly by a mean girl on the first day of school who humiliates him for having a dog for a father. Then a child protection services official threatens to separate Sherman from Mr. Peabody forever. This is the supposed glue the ""heart"" of the story propping up the wacky trips in time made by Sherman and his frenemy Penny.These two and our bow-tied canine hero visit a variety of locales and times among them Revolutionary France; ancient Egypt; ancient Troy just in time for the Trojan horse bit; and the Renaissance with Leonardo da Vinci and his flying apparatus. Some of this is amusing. But the films animation design is strictly generic in its rounded edges and dutiful 3-D IN YOUR FACE gimmicks. And the story gets off to such a sour start it takes a long time for the comedy to recover.Ty Burrell of ""Modern Family"" voices Peabody perhaps a little too close to the originals cadences; Max Charles does Sherman; first-rate supporting talents help out where they can ranging from Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann (as the bullys parents) to Patrick Warburton (Agamemnon) to Mel Brooks (in a bit role as Einstein). The epilogue contains more decent and fleet-footed setups and payoffs than the whole of the previous 80-odd minutes and therefore may well send audiences out with a warm feeling. ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" manages to stay out of the dumpster inhabited by the eerily unfunny ""Adventures of Rocky amp; Bullwinkle"" (2000) which blended live action with animation to no avail. Minkoffs film has its moments one of them near the end when Peabody wags his tail that will score with anybody who lives with or near a dog.

Photo DreamWorks Animation/AP MOVIE REVIEW Mr. Peabody and Sherman Running time 80 minutes. Rated PG (cartoon violence rude humor) At the E-Walk Lincoln Square Union Square others. Perhaps no other TV property has inspired as many bad movies as the clever eponymous half-hour cartoon series originally known as ""Rocky and His Friends (1959-1964) -- ""Boris and Natasha (1992) ""Dudley Do-Right (1999) and worst of all the part-animated ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle starring Robert De Niro as Fearless Leader. Against all odds DreamWorks Animation has created a smart funny and beautifully designed feature called ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman out of the ""Rocky segment ""Peabodys Improbable History in which a hyperintelligent beagle and his adopted human son travel through time and meet famous personages. Rob Minkoff (who co-directed ""The Lion King) and his team offer a pleasingly retro-style contemporary Manhattan and historical settings which put the crude original animation to shame. But they remain remarkably faithful to the original dog-and-his-boy concept (complete with puns) while adding contemporary resonance that doesnt feel forced. During his first day at school 7-year-old Sherman (Max Charles) is teased for having a dog as a father. ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" features the voice talents of (from left) Max Charles Ariel Winter and Ty Burrell.Photo DreamWorks Animation/AP When the geeky orange-haired Sherman bites the teaser classmate Penny (Ariel Winter) a social worker (Allison Janney) tries to take the lad away from the prissy Mr. Peabody (Ty Burrell of ""Modern Family channeling David Hyde-Pierce). Mr. Peabody tries to smooth everything over by inviting Penny and her parents (Leslie Mann and Stephen Colbert) over to the penthouse he shares with Sherman. But while hes showing off his skills as a mixologist musician and chiropractor Sherman unwisely decides to take Penny for a spin in Mr. Peabodys WABAC machine. The film makes stops during the French Revolution ancient Egypt and the Trojan wars -- and Renaissance Florence where Mr. Peabody gets Mona Lisa to smile so Leonardo da Vinci (Stanley Tucci) can help with repairs to the WABAC machine. Our oddly matched heroes eventually have to deal with a rupture in the space-time continuum -- good thing they can consult with Albert Einstein (Mel Brooks). Loaded with improbable cultural references (Sherman totes a Stephen Hawking lunchbox and uses words like ""eponymous"") I fear ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman may be a bit too brainy to fully connect with contemporary movie audiences. But it certainly gets points for championing nontraditional families in ways the creators of ""Rocky and His Friends could never have imagined.

"Review Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman 2.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Interview Ty Burrell By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Mar 6 2014 751 AM One of the most-beloved bits in ""The Rocky amp; Bullwinkle Show"" was ""Peabodys Improbable History"" a series of short cartoon segments starring Mr. Peabody a genius dog and Sherman his adopted son. Thanks to the WABAC (or Wayback) machine one of Mr. Peabodys inventions the two could travel back in time so that Sherman could witness history in person. Like everything in ""Rocky amp; Bullwinkle"" it had a nice little subversive edge of insanity making it just weird enough to appeal to parents as well as the kids at which the show was ostensibly aimed. Plus it featured some really great -- which is to say awful -- puns. ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" the big-screen feature-length version of the duos adventures retains the main characters the WABAC machine the trips through history -- but not the sense of nuttiness that made the TV cartoon so delightful. Instead Rob Minkoffs film has the generic feel of a kids movie thats trying to please everyone. Its not horrible. In fact its agreeable enough. But nothing more. The delightful Ty Burrell (""Modern Family"") puts his own idiosyncratic spin on Mr. Peabodys voice. (He has a distinctive way of speaking thats instantly recognizable.) And Max Charles is suitably cute as Sherman. But as a whole the film falls flat. Naturally screenwriter Craig Wright had to stretch things out to make a whole movie. The story centers on Sherman going for the first time to school. Naturally there are interesting discussions in history class. Hes seen most of what theyre studying in person after all (though he keeps his WABAC visits a secret). This doesnt sit well with Penny Peterson (Ariel Winter) who teases Sherman until he um bites her. (Like father like son.) To ward off the evil social worker Ms. Grunion (Allison Janney) Mr. Peabody invites Penny and her parents (Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann) to dinner and despite Pennys apparent dislike for Sherman things go swimmingly. Until the kids get into the forbidden WABAC machine. It isnt Shermans fault not really. Hes so desperate to impress Penny that he crosses the line. Next thing you know theyre in ancient Egypt and Penny is about to become the child bride of the child ruler King Tut (Zach Callison). And so it goes with other trips to and from history with the associated problems to solve. Given the nature of the story Minkoff is locked into working together set pieces involving different visits into the past. Eventually however a mishap creates a rift in the ever-popular space-time continuum. So more drama. The film pushes the father-son relationship between Mr. Peabody and Sherman far more than the shorts did. And although its tempting to say ugh its a dog and a kid this is after all a story about a genius dog and the boy he adopts. So that parts OK. Its just that it works hard to smooth out the rough edges which is a big part of what made the original so charming. As ""Rocky amp; Bullwinkle"" fans know -- and surely everyone must be one -- the ragged animation was part and parcel of the shaggy genius of the show. ""Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman"" looks great in the way any TV insurance commercial or web video might. But that misses the point. As to some extent does the movie. Its OK. But unlike the TV bits it isnt really memorable. Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman Director Rob Minkoff. Cast Ty Burrell Max Charles Stephen Colbert.

Share Tweet The Peabodys Improbable History shorts which aired alongside the adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle plainly stated their approach to actual historical events right there in the title. The super-intelligent beagle and his boy Sherman once rescued Ludwig Van Beethoven from the middle of a busy intersection filled with cars--in 19th-century Vienna Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman continues that fast and loose relationship with history. Agamemnon jokes to his Greek soldiers about Achilles hurting his heel from inside the Trojan horse despite the fact that the infamous injury doesnt occur until the end of the Trojan War. And Marie Antoinette giggles like a buffoon while stuffing her face with various fancy cakes. But unlike the whimsical slapstick-driven shorts on which its based this feature-length adaptation adds an obligatory emotional arc that feels at odds with the zany spirit of historical time-travel tales.In a reversal of ""boy adopts dog"" narratives Mr. Peabody (Modern Familys Ty Burrell) discovers the infant Sherman (Max Charles) abandoned in a cardboard box--a rewrite of the Improbable History backstory which had Peabody rescuing a much older Sherman from bullies. As a successful inventor scholar and business icon Peabody smugly presumes it should be easy for a multitalented creature to raise a child. On Shermans first day of school hes bullied by Penny (Burrells Family co-star Ariel Winter) prompting an intervention from a child-protection official (Allison Janney) looking to place Sherman in a home with human parents. That leads to an awkward reconciliation dinner with Penny and her parents at the Peabody residence which quickly devolves into Sherman and Penny gallivanting through time eventually requiring Peabodys rescue.Shermans historical excursions with Peabody are framed as an overly involved parent attempting to broaden the mind of his young charge. They use the WABAC machine to investigate famous events but unlike the original cartoon theres no clarification that theyre traveling in a ""should have been"" machine that justifies the kooky bent of the historical figures from Leonardo Da Vinci (Stanley Tucci) to George Washington (Animaniacs Jess Harnell). Sherman even informs his classmates about apocryphal stories simultaneously debunking perpetuated historical myths while roving through wildly inaccurate scenarios.Peabodys air of superiority and stuffy ingenuity permeate much of the films humor which relies on constant punning and Shermans blank stares of misunderstanding. But Peabody amp; Sherman also tries to link the two characters together in a heartfelt father-son tale a dog unadoptable for his quirks attempting to provide a loving home for a child of similar circumstances. Penny--seemingly thrown into the story to provide a main female character--begins as a bully jealous of the knowledge Sherman has accrued from his father but once along for the adventure she morphs into both the object of Shermans affection and the ""bad influence"" who coaxes him out of his shell and drives a wedge between him and a protective Peabody. Its a balancing act that never quite feels natural. In trying to attach a moral arc to the story the filmmakers pull focus from the whimsical disregard for actual events.The animators resist employing Dreamworks signature smirk but many characters have oversized heads and rail-thin limbs their eyes gigantic and their expressions over-emoted. Thankfully when the 3-D action sequences get going--in ancient Egypt Renaissance Florence and Troy in particular--most of the problems momentarily melt away. Director Rob Minkoff has both The Lion King and the Stuart Little films on his resume which helps explain why Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman nails its big set pieces while getting dragged down by cloying sentimentality.For the first two acts the wacky humor keeps the ancillary emotional plot at bay. But after a twist forces Sherman to break Peabodys one cardinal rule of time-travel--used to prevent paradoxical self-encounters--the wheels come off. Peabody resorts to characters shouting incoherent technobabble at the problem as the film rises to an explosive finale. (One example The final action sequence grossly misuses the phrase ""terminal velocity."") This wont matter to kids occupied by bright colors and whooshing action. But the astutely droll tone of the original shorts only shows up here in fragments.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 845 a.m. EST March 7 2014Pedantic pooch pops off with some clever bon mots but the movie is overall too predictable and forced.Sherman (Max Charles left) Penny (Ariel Winter) and Mr. Peabody (Ty Burrell) get in trouble in ancient Egypt and have to flee back to the WABAC in Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman.(Photo DreamWorks Animation)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourVoices Ty Burrell Max Charles Ariel Winter Stephen Colbert Leslie Mann Allison JanneyRuntime 1 hour 32 minutes; Rated PG; opens Friday nationwidePuns plus potty humor equals Peabody. Still its hard to resist the bespectacled brainiac dog and his beloved boy.Based on the series of 1960s cartoon shorts about a hyper-intelligent hound and his genially mischievous boy Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman (1/2 out of four; rated PG; opening Friday nationwide) is lively educational and intermittently amusing. The fun however grows strained and formulaic as the movie goes on.Most of Peabodys witticisms involve clever wordplay aimed at adults. The bathroom humor though not egregious seems shoehorned in for the kiddies.Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell) is a pedantic patrician beagle whose accomplishments are vast. Hes an inventor a Nobel laureate a captain of industry an Olympic athlete an accomplished linguist a master chef and a virtuoso on every known instrument. The only area in which he falters slightly is parenting.STORY Ty Burrells Family expansion includes big moviesSNEAK PEEK A new time for Mr. Peabody amp; ShermanMORE Colbert s Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman casting bumpREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersHis adopted boy Sherman (Max Charles) is an eager learner a 7-year-old who takes well to his cultured fathers teachings.Shermans lessons are decidedly up close and personal. His genius four-legged father has fashioned a time machine and Sherman has spent his childhood dropping in on luminaries such as Mahatma Gandhi and George Washington absorbing information firsthand.Burrell voices Peabody with geeky affability and razor-sharp comic timing. Charles lends Sherman an appealing vulnerability.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Mr. Peabody ""the most amazing dog of all time"" must travel back in time to save mankind from the mess made by little Sherman and Penny. Where the movie falters is in a plot construct about a mean schoolmate of Shermans Penny (Ariel Winter) a spoiled bully of a girl on whom Sherman develops a crush. What kind of lesson does this send children? That they should get all moony-eyed over those who mistreat them?When Penny and her parents (Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann) are invited to the Peabody household to smooth over the kids differences Penny and Sherman sneak off for a joyride in the time machine. Mr. Peabody must fetch them. Zany time-travel adventures ensue including a fissure in the space-time continuum that must be repaired.While it seems churlish to nitpick about a movie that offers young viewers light but engaging history lessons on ancient Egypt the Renaissance the Trojan War and the French Revolution some of these escapades feel forced contrived and overly eager like a dog performing for treats. Leonardo da Vinci has the stereotypical Italian accent associated with commercials about spicy meatballs and the Trojan warriors bear an uncanny resemblance to frat brothers.Lessons abound in family films and the intended one here is simple For all the education Sherman receives from Mr. Peabody the brainy dog also learns something important from his son -- how to be more relaxed and trusting.When Sherman tells his canine pop that he loves him the stiff Mr. Peabody responds with ""I have a deep regard for you as well.""A larger message is one weve heard often in animated films Families come in many varieties and permutations. The point might bear repeating but the line ""Its an adoptive relationship"" quickly grows stale with reiteration.A subplot involving an overbearing child-services official (Allison Janney) intent on separating boy and dog provides needless conflict. If audiences can suspend their disbelief to accept a talking dog who went to Harvard and established a legal precedent in cross-species adoption why throw in additional real-world bureaucracy to blandly muck things up?While the animation is richly colorful the 3-D adds little value.The sprightly humor in this good-natured film about fathers and sons will appeal to parents and grandparents. While harder to predict if kids will love this time-traveling saga nostalgic adults are likely to have a deep regard for it. 49 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1iaHGMc",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/03/05/mr-peabody-and-sherman-review/5807851/,200,mr.peabody&sherman23,mr.peabody&sherman,usatoday
