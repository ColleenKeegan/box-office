Only Rudolph with his nose so bright could hope to spotlight every last inanity in ""Reindeer Games"" a breathlessly paced potboiler thats a ""thriller"" in name only. With a far-fetched script that might barely have passed muster at the B units in the old studio days this Dimension release will command a certain up-front attention due to cast topliners Ben Affleck Gary Sinise and Charlize Theron and vet director John Frankenheimer in his follow-up to ""Ronin."" But pic will have to pull off a quick B.O. heist as the alarms signaling a botched job will go off immediately. One can almost envision the picture as it might have been done as a low-budget film noir a half-century ago Dennis OKeefe Sterling Hayden or if we were lucky Robert Mitchum getting out of prison and impersonating his recently deceased cellmate in order to take up with the girl (Lizabeth Scott Peggy Cummins or if he were lucky Jane Greer) with whom the latter had fallen in love via correspondence. Little does he know of course that shes not the sweet romantic creature of her letters and that this liaison will ensnare him in a lethal plot to knock over a casino on Christmas Eve. The one nod Frankenheimer makes in the direction of the terse hard-boiled gritty noir style in which such a yarn virtually demands to be made is to shoot it in such a high-contrast color-desaturated manner that it comes close to looking like a black-and-white film. It also barrels along at a fast clip but rather in the manner of a train ignoring all semaphores and warning lights on its way to a calamitous arrival at its destination. Looking far more like a college frat boy than a hardened con finishing out a five-year stretch for grand theft auto Affleck shuffles in as the affable Rudy whose roomie Nick (James Frain) has plastered the walls with pictures of the luminous Ashley (Theron) who has promised to be waiting for him when he gets out in two days. But Nick doesnt survive that long so when Rudy upon his release spots a lovely gal shivering in the Northern Michigan snow waiting for a man he knows wont be coming out he approaches her and introduces himself as ... Nick. After the briefest of preliminaries the sex-starved souls jump each others bones in a nearby motel. But just as Rudy throws out his drivers license with the intention of playing out the Nick hand as long as he can in bursts a bunch of thugs led by Gabriel (Sinise in full Charles Manson regalia) who says hes Ashleys brother and in between persuasive threats and thwacks demands his help in robbing the nearby Indian casino of millions. The real Nick it turns out used to work in security at the casino and thus could have provided invaluable assistance. Rudy quickly realizing that hell be dead meat if Gabriel believes his initial protests that hes not really Nick is forced to improvise and come up with at least faintly plausible answers to Gabriels many questions all the while looking for a way out of his jam. Tales mid-section generates some engagement and even momentary tension as Rudy twice manages to escape only to be thwarted and tortured (once by darts tossed by Gabriel) and the true relationships and intentions of the characters are weighed and at least partially revealed. Rudy remains extremely pissed at Ashleys treachery (""I had better sex in prison"" he insults her in one of scripter Ehren Krugers few potent lines) but still retains the slight hope that in a final reckoning she might side with him against her evil brother. This is one of those movies in which an otherwise ruthless villain repeatedly spares the life of the hero for no reason other than that the picture would have to end if he whacked him. Time and again the crazed Gabriel is on the verge of finishing Rudy off only to reconsider in uncertainty over his actual identity. Once his cover is blown after a reconnaissance visit to the casino Gabriel keeps swallowing Rudys b.s. about how Nick told him crucial info about casino operations. Its Gabriels notion that the gang will raid the nearly empty casino wearing Santa Claus suits. But in the ensuing mayhem the Christmas booty doesnt get distributed very fairly and the final reel has more twists dissension and betrayals than ""The Asphalt Jungle"" ""The Killing"" and ""Odds Against Tomorrow"" combined or at least seems to given how theyre piled one on top of another to ludicrous effect within minutes of each other. (Dimensions presskit begs critics not to reveal ""unexpected plot developments so that the audience can enjoy them for the first time"" as if this were ""The Crying Game"" all over again but no such luck.) Too much the everyday good guy to lend weight or sardonic irony to a role that needs something in the way of an attitude Affleck isnt the most convincing bluffer in the world in his crucial scenes opposite Sinise; in a contemporary context one could imagine such a role best played either by a tough customer such as Bruce Willis or a slithery chameleon on the order of Edward Norton. Sinise who won an Emmy playing George Wallace for Frankenheimer is pumped up and mean as a mother as a lifelong trucker looking for his one big haul while Theron is plenty foxy but it would seem too classy to be hanging around all these lowlifes. Little effort is made to sketch in the other members of Gabriels gang other than by differentiated looks. Shot in British Columbia under forbidding looking conditions that only make one hope that there were plenty of hot drinks and warm blankets on hand pic has the mostly slapdash inelegant look and sound of a programmer of yore. For Frankenheimer among his recent features this is unfortunately closer to ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" than to last years gritty and solid ""Ronin.""

Starring Ben Affleck Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise. Directed by John Frankenheimer. (VHS and DVD. R. 110 minutes.) ""Reindeer Games"" is one of the smartest action thrillers to come along in the past few years. The picture feels like the beginning of something -- a post- Tarantino era in movie action. Directed by John Frankenheimer and written by San Franciscos Ehren Kruger the film has some of the outrageousness of a Tarantino effort without the smirky nihilism and heartlessness. Its made by people who know the action genre inside-out and yet dont feel the need to comment on the genre every two minutes. The tone is playful without being cute. Ben Affleck plays Rudy an imprisoned car thief and familiar film noir hero -- a robust everyman just smart enough to get himself into trouble and too dumb to get himself out. His path to trouble is a time- honored one. It arrives thanks to a woman who seems so nice so pretty -- at first. Charlize Theron plays Ashley who strikes up a pen-pal relationship with Rudys cell mate Nick (James Frain). When Nick is killed on the day he is supposed to be released from prison Rudy also released that day pretends to be Nick and he and Ashley go off to a motel. The evolution of the Ashley character one of the delights of the film can only be alluded to here. Frankenheimer and Theron present her at first as almost a parody of wholesomeness. Next thing we know our hero has descended into film noir hell. ""Reindeer Games"" is a twisted caper film. Gary Sinise plays Ashleys brother Gabriel a violent criminal who kidnaps Rudy and forces him to take part in a casino robbery. Moments of comedy pop up throughout without ever tilting the picture into satire or parody. As Gabriel Sinise is dim-witted but too scary to be completely laughable. ""Reindeer Games"" is an extremely violent film and not all of its plot turns make sense under scrutiny. But Frankenheimer drives the action in such a way that there is no such thing as stopping to consider whether it all makes sense. ..

Hitchcock could always get you laughing at his life-or-death felicity and such disparate modern suspense films as Jaws Mad Max Die Hard and Pulp Fiction have recognized that theres no contradiction in making an audience feel gripped and tickled at the same time. On the other hand theres Reindeer Games. Set in Michigan during a cold and slushy Christmas its full of machine-gun shoot-outs and vehicle-over-the-cliff climaxes; it has a hero a genially duplicitous car thief named Rudy Duncan (Ben Affleck) who endures endless sadistic pummelings only to emerge with little more than a bloody nose; and it goes out of its way to showcase a casino heist in which a couple of gang members disguise themselves as Santa Claus. Reindeer Games in other words displays no ambition to be anything more than a synthetic sense-jolt conveyor of the week. Yet the veteran director John Frankenheimer coming off his ""Look I can still stage a great car chase"" comeback Ronin treats this trashy disreputable material with a brute squareness so leaden and dour its practically Teutonic; he doesnt seem to realize that hes making Con Air and not French Connection III. Frankenheimer fills the movie with looming portentous close-ups (you can practically count Afflecks pearly whites not to mention Gary Sinises not-so-pearly ones) and he treats characters that appear to have been conceived as boorish violent morons as if they were memorable rotters on the low-criminal ladder. Just out of prison Afflecks Rudy improvises a half-baked scheme to pass himself off as his former cell mate Nick (James Frain). Its all so that Rudy can hook up with Ashley (Charlize Theron) the adoring cutie who had become involved with Nick through a series of lonely hearts prison letters. (The two never actually met.) Rudy has little trouble -- and apparently no scruples -- assuming the identity of his convict buddy who disappears from the film early on after being critically stabbed. Theres a hitch though -- a greasy-haired petty crook named Gabriel (Sinise) who has used Ashleys letters to lure Nick into helping him rob a casino. Nick who used to work at the casino is supposed to know its layout the location of the secret safe and so on. But Rudy doesnt know any of this. Are his attempts at deception clever? Funny? Suspenseful? Actually none of the above; the characters see through him nearly as quickly as the audience does. Gabriel however in an act of stupido convenience keeps convincing himself that Rudy is Nick. Sure he needs the guy for his robbery but more than that Reindeer Games needs to sustain its gapingly slipshod identity charade. Otherwise thered be no movie. Thats a shame too since Affleck has just what it takes to play a nice-guy con artist. Hes ingenuous even baby-faced but he gathers force as an actor when he has to steamroll someone or talk his way out of a jam. Unfortunately the script by Ehren Kruger (Arlington Road Scream 3) offers the star little in the way of fast and loose verbal play. Sinise hams tastefully though his rabid small-time scoundrel comes off as more mingy than menacing and Theron wears her characters shifting sympathies about as rotely as she does her orange dye job. The performance that really should have counted was Frankenheimers. He keeps this joyless machine moving but most of the time he seems stranded between eras investing ""conviction"" in a movie that was never meant to be more than a glib quasi-parody. Wheres Simon West or Michael Bay when you need them? In Reindeer Games Frankenheimer is a craftsman trying to do a hacks job.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; reindeer-games ) Reindeer Games (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli With the possible exception of the talent involved everything about Reindeer Games smacks of a B movie the kind of film that with a lesser cast would have been shipped directly to Cinemax or Showtime. Reindeer Games suffers from a poorly written screenplay that coupled with static and uninspired direction lends the production a cheap and cheesy feel. And the big ""twist"" at the end which will undoubtedly become one of the films prime selling hooks comes from so far afield that its impossible to logically predict. (However if you take the tactic of guessing what the least likely and most contrived occurrence will be you have a fair chance of figuring out this secret.) Anyone mentioning the name Hitchcock in association with Reindeer Games should be flogged for blasphemy. Contrary to popular opinion not all of Hitchcocks movies were great examples of cinema but even in his less successful efforts the Master of Suspense always managed to persuade the audience to engage their suspension of disbelief. Thats a crucial element to the success of any thriller but Reindeer Games is saddled with such a blatantly preposterous plot that it defies attempts by the sincere movie-goer to become immersed in the story. The director is John Frankenheimer a filmmaker with what could charitably be called an uneven reputation. Frankenheimer who did a lot of work for TV during the 90s began his motion picture career in the 60s helming such classics as The Manchurian Candidate Seven Days in May and The Iceman Cometh. But he is also responsible for drek like The Holocroft Covenant and the 1996 remake of The Island of Dr. Moreau. In 1998 Frankenheimer appeared to be making a rebound with Ronin a tight taut thriller about double-crossing mercenaries. Unfortunately Reindeer Games has knocked him right back down again. Reindeer Games opens in Michigans Iron Mountain Prision a maximum security institution where cellmates Rudy (Ben Affleck) and Nick (James Frain) are days away from their release. Each has different goals for his upcoming freedom. Its almost Christmas and Rudy wants to go home for a mug of hot chocolate and a piece of pecan pie. Nick on the other hand is looking forward to a hot holiday spent in a motel room with a beautiful girl named Ashley (Charlize Theron). The two met as part of a convict pen-pal program and a hundred letters later theyre ready to consummate their relationship. But Nick never gets the chance to walk through the prison gates; he is killed in a cafeteria skirmish. On the day of his release Rudy sees Ashley waiting for Nick looking exactly like she did in the pictures she sent him. Knowing that she is oblivious to her correspondents appearance Rudy does the kind of thing that only a movie character would do and passes himself off as Nick. This turns out to be a mistake because Ashley has a psychopathic brother named Gabriel (Gary Sinise) who has decided that the ex-con is going to help him pull a casino robbery - or else. However since the success of the crime depends largely on Nicks knowledge of the establishment from his days as a security guard there and since Rudy has never set foot in the place there are some significant problems to overcome. Whatever flaws it may have at least Reindeer Games can boast solid performances from Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise. Theron who has shown herself to be a talented actress in movies like The Devils Advocate and The Cider House Rules manages somehow to be convincing throughout this sloppy production despite some of the ripe lines of dialogue she is forced to utter. Sinise a performer with great range and ability is in danger of becoming typecast as a villain. Hes as scary as anyone else playing this kind of role yet he never chews on the scenery with the unrestrained gusto of a Dennis Hopper or a Christopher Walken. Meanwhile Ben Affleck does not deliver one of his better performances. None of the charisma or energy evident in Afflecks Boiler Room work is on display here. The real problem is the storyline these actors find themselves trapped in. Written by Scream 3 scribe Ehren Kruger Reindeer Games is an inept blend of routine action sequences howlingly bad dialogue and standard thriller plot elements. Contrivances abound - not since TVs MacGyver has anyone been as handy as Rudy with a dart a knife and a squirt gun. With the exception of the big twist everything in this film is disappointingly predictable. And in the end Kruger is forced to rely on one of the most tired plot twists of them all - the bad guy who holds the good guy at gunpoint while explaining the entire vile plan to him. In spite of the films inherent badness or perhaps because of it it is possible to derive a certain level of masochistic pleasure from watching Reindeer Games. The film shows little or no inventiveness. Visually its uninteresting with an over-reliance upon close-ups and static shots and theres a special effects scene that is shockingly unconvincing. But for those who go into this film with expectations of a B movie (something encouraged by the recognition that Miramax is releasing the picture under their Dimension imprint) disappointment will be curtailed. Theres a little gratuitous nudity and quite a bit of violence - enough that Reindeer Games probably wont look half-bad when it finally makes it to cable TV where it belongs in the first place.
