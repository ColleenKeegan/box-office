They go on to say that this ""bright light"" phenomenon is merely the symptom of a faltering brain and that it shouldnt be used as proof of heaven or of some greater power. What the hell? This is what science has been working on? Taking away the last vestige of hope from potentially dying people? Yeeps. Science needs a new job. Thats atrocious work science. Do better next time. Into this sad little world steps the movie Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass doesnt care what you think of it doesnt care what you make of the ultra-violence doesnt even want to hear about your social concerns with the overarching message. Kick-Ass simply wants to kick your ass. Then it will wait for you to get up and dust yourself off where ideally it will commence kicking your ass a bit more. So yeah its pretty big fun. Lets break it down What would happen if you raised a little girl to be a sociopathic lunatic? Im talking about a full-on mayhemic level of parenting here the sort where you taught her to use her smallish frame to inflict massive and mortal damage on unsuspecting goons. You then equipped her with knives guns and bazookas. It would be awesome right? But also a bit worrisome no? I mean society cant just have little preteen ninjas running around killing people can it? Thats storyline one Nicolas Cage and his baby girl played by Chloe Moretz. They are for lack of a better word completely excellent. Her costumed name is ""Hit Girl"" while he goes by the moniker ""Big Daddy."" Again awesome. The second storyline is of a high school student who decides to take matters into his own hands. Hes a comic book geek but as the movie rightly points out comic book geeks seem to be the least likely folk on the planet to transform themselves into superheroes to fight crime. When did laziness co-opt the comic book movement? But not this guy. The character is played by Aaron Johnson and he intends to fight crime all by his lonesome. Because who wants to live in a world where people idly watch evil every day? Along the way he hopes to have a girlfriend. He calls himself ""Kick-Ass"" and he pokes at the edges of our communal apathy. Hes a one-man counterargument to the ""we all watched but no one helped"" psychology of the moment. He is without a doubt hopelessly outgunned. Enter Mark Strong the baddie from Sherlock Holmes as the baddie here. Both Kick-Ass and the father-daughter duo of Big Daddy and Hit Girl will have dealings with him. But thats wandering too far down the plot highway and not at all the point of this review. But know that this film is funnier than youd think more violent than youd guess and more effective than the trailers indicate. That said Kick-Ass is certainly offensive. And stepping back from the art itself you could make a compelling argument that the mixed messages of condemning ""bad guys"" while espousing a radical and reactionary counter-offensive is both logically and morally bankrupt. As for me? I cant find the distance to step back from the work and as such I really enjoyed myself. Theres a scene in Kick-Ass one I dont dare ruin filled with strobe lights and fire punctuated by first-person shooter camera work bodies dropping all over the place. Light and sound fused mixed and brewed with a coiled action a scene that cant help but emotionally draw you in. Its those scenes I keep going back to when Im thinking about Kick-Ass that moment of being up against the wall but knowing youre in the right. Most of the lessons in Kick-Ass are juvenile but Lordy are they stylishly told. Even more than that you feel something while watching Kick-Ass and that something is worth more than all the judgment and intellect in the world. Do you remember feeling something when you watched movies? It was just a moment ago just out of reach just the slow dying whisper of a tiny little girl.

Save for later Saved Adapted from a comic book Chloe Moretz and a bunch of wannabe young superheroes in Kick-Ass dont shy from expletive-filled hard-core violence. By Peter Rainer Film critic April 16 2010 Save for later Saved Actors (l.-r.) Christopher Mintz-Plasse Chloe Moretz and Aaron Johnson pose for a portrait during a media day promoting the film Kick-Ass in New York April 8. Lucas Jackson/Reuters          View Caption About video ads View Caption of What can you say about a movie in which an 11-year-old girl slices and dices hordes of hoodlums while mouthing choice obscenities that might give even a truck driver pause? Welcome to ""Kick-Ass"" the latest and most egregious example of a comic book series-turned-movie. If we keep upping - or to be accurate lowering - the ante like this pretty soon well be watching toddlers toting Uzis. Or havent I already seen that? The perfervid imagination of comic book author Mark Millar was also the basis for the Angelina Jolie splatterfest ""Wanted."" As a special service he and director and co-writer Matthew Vaughn and Vaughns co-screenwriter Jane Goldman have thoughtfully reached out to preteens by providing them with their very own superhero - though the films R rating rather puts a damper on that bit of generosity no?The premise to ""Kick-Ass"" which plays like a Disney family film hijacked by Quentin Tarantino is not unpromising though like everything else in the movie it pays homage to - i.e. rips off - a million other comic book actioners. Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a geeky New York high-schooler who decides he wants to be a superhero. Calling himself Kick-Ass he mail orders an unflattering costume confronts the local bullies and gets himself so banged up that he ends up with metal plates in his back. This turns out to be a good thing because his dulled nerve endings mean he can fight again and not feel pain. Alas we in the audience are not so lucky. I found it mighty painful sitting through all the bone crushing and blood-letting. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Kick-Ass is nothing compared to the films crime-fighting father-and-daughter duo Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage). Vowing to revenge himself on Mafia honcho Frank DAmico (Mark Strong) for making him a widower ex-cop Big Daddy has been training Hit Girl (real name Mindy Macready) for mortal combat. Their first scene together is a touching example of paternal guidance In order to get her ready for prime time he repeatedly fires bullets into her bullet-proof-vest protected chest. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Chloe Moretz in Kick-Ass -- are toddlers toting Uzis next? It gets better. Their first crime intervention is so gory that even Tarantino might be envious. On the other hand hes probably flattered - the double-blade wielding Hit Girl in her purple Clara Bow wig and pleated skirt is like a ""Mini-Me"" version of Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill."" And like that film we are encouraged to see the violence here as strictly cartoon stuff.But why should we especially when the chief perpetrator is an 11-year-old girl? The sheer exuberance of blowing things up of kicking ass can be liberating to watch but too often the most dubious cinematic representations of violence are given a free pass because after all its only a movie. But its not only a movie. If its OK to show preteens slicing the opposition while mouthing unprintables then where exactly is one supposed to draw the line?I reject the argument that because this is a fantasy no line need be drawn. Thats just an excuse a commercial convenience. When a preteen Natalie Portman costarred in the sadistic action film ""The Professional"" her presence had a smarmy-porny quality that was much remarked upon and which one can only hope the director Luc Besson did not intend. This is a far cry from say Jodie Fosters preteen hooker in Scorseses ""Taxi Driver"" a role and a performance that was entirely justified because it dealt with the consequences of exploitation rather than being a piece of exploitation in itself - which essentially is what ""Kick-Ass"" is. Having as its centerpiece the pint-size Hit Girl will probably be enough to make it a hit. (Clips from the film have already gone viral in the comic-geek world.) Maybe in the sequel she can spawn a brood of Hit-ettes.Critics who come out against ""Kick-Ass"" are leaving themselves open to that worst of contemporary accusations a failure to be cool. But pretending that ""Kick-Ass"" is just another good-time comic book blowout is the greater failure.

By Anthony Lane Chloe Moretz Aaron Johnson Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Nicolas Cage.   Credit Illustration by Thierry Guitard To point out that Matthew Vaughns ""Kick-Ass"" is based on a comic book is not saying much. A glance through the schedule suggests that every film released this year is based on a comic book or else devoutly wishes that it were with the possible exception of that documentary on sheep pasturing. Producers reach for the Marvel shelf as instinctively as they once grazed the Book-of-the-Month Club and for similar reasons homing in on the sweet spot of popular taste. ""Kick-Ass"" began publication only two years ago but the cover line of its second issue (""Sickening Violence Just the Way You Like It"") bore the exact tinge of lip-smacking irony that now passes for worldly sophistication. This rage to provoke is transferred to Vaughns film which he co-wrote with Jane Goldman. Our hero is a high-school zero named Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) who has a yearning for status and substance--or in laymans terms love. Since none is available he compensates first by pretending to be a masked crime-fighter called Kick-Ass and second by resorting to frantic self-abuse although I would bracket those two as a single impulse. Kick-Ass wears a cheap wetsuit and gets nowhere until one of his pathetic attempts at justice is posted on YouTube at which point he becomes a star. It is hard to see where the plot can go from here so Goldman and Vaughn come to its aid by introducing a pair of real crime-fighters Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz). The twist is that they are father and daughter perhaps the closest duo since Oedipus and Antigone though unless you have a particularly corrupt text you will not find Antigone greeting a roomful of evil men with the words ""O.K. you cunts lets see what you can do now."" This line has already plunged the film into a froth of infamy and if you really think that Vaughn and Goldman (both of whom are British) planned it any other way you are behind the times. A film casts its bait and we bite. Vaughn knows that the vulnerability of the young is a more tremulous issue than ever so he switches things around leaving grownups vulnerable to their juniors. Hit Girl is eleven years old and schooled by her father to slaughter and maim while displaying no emotion other than fizzy glee. Her first mass murder of a drug dealer and his posse is a flurry of cartwheels and gougings backed by the theme tune from ""The Banana Splits."" Many viewers no question will be jazzed up by the sensory sugar rush of this but its worth asking once the movie has calmed down whether we have witnessed a silly mismatch of innocence and experience to be relished for its gross-out verve or a formidable exercise in cynicism. ""Kick-Ass"" is violences answer to kiddie porn. You can see it in Hit Girls outfit when she cons her way past security guards--white blouse hair in pigtails short tartan skirt--and in the winsome way that she pleads to be inculcated into grownup excess. That pleading is the dream of every pedophile and I wonder if Goldman paused to examine her contribution to the myth. (Note what the script does with mothers Daves expires at the breakfast table causing no blip in the rhythm of his life and Hit Girls was dead before she was born. Thus is any trace of tenderness expunged before our tale begins.) Goldman would presumably say that it is violence not sex that our pre-teen heroine learns but that is a cowardly distinction--although to be fair it is a cowardice shared by everyone from the M.P.A.A. down. ""Kick-Ass"" is rated R which means that adults are free to take children to watch a child hurting adults a neatly wrapped package like ""Home Alone"" on growth hormones. The standard defense of such material is that we are watching ""cartoon violence"" but when filmmakers nudge a child into viewing savagery as slapstick are we not allowing them to do what we condemn in the pornographer--that is to coarsen and inflame? If you find your enjoyment of ""Kick-Ass"" unclouded by such issues good luck to you. The rest of the movie feels pretty secondhand anyway as a heavily British cast tries teeth-grindingly hard to be American. Aaron Johnson in the title role is the only one who doesnt show the strain and its a pity that his early goofiness is cut short; by the end as Kick-Ass pilots a jet pack armed with Gatling guns around the New York skyline any claim that the film could be spoofing or lightly humanizing the usual overkill of the comic book has long since been wiped away. Back to fantasy then just the way we like it. Who made ""Exit Through the Gift Shop""? No writer or director is credited but it describes itself as ""A Banksy Film."" To those of you who keep up with developments in street art less eagerly than you should it must be explained that Banksy is not a derogatory adjective but the alias of an unspecified British artist who has indeed put art on the streets. His paintings and stencillings have won him a fan base of fashionable ardor unceasingly piqued by his anonymity. As if in tribute to that eel-like elusiveness only a portion of ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is about the man himself. We see a cowled and low-lit figure who speaks with a West Country burr. (This is the most derided of English accents associated in the public ear with a rustic slowness and splendidly out of kilter with the braying of the art world.) Banksy tells us about a guy who was trying to make a documentary about him whereupon--hey presto--the rest of the movie turns around and follows that guy. He is Thierry Guetta though he pronounces his first name ""Terry"" thus becoming one of the few Frenchmen in history to prefer his Anglicized self. Even his mustache betrays a Victorian luxuriance; ""He looked like something out of the eighteen-sixties"" as Banksy says. Guetta explains that living in Los Angeles with his wife and children he became interested in then addicted to the hit-and-run world of street art. He made friends with a number of artists whether they wanted befriending or not and filmed them with a handheld video camera as they worked. Eventually the road led to Banksy for whom Guetta became a partner in crime--accompanying him to Disneyland where Banksy placed an inflatable doll resembling a hooded inmate at Guantanamo next to a ride causing Guetta to endure hours of unamused questioning by the authorities. Even this failed to sate him and the latter half of the movie shows him deciding to cross over and become an artist himself like a war reporter picking up a gun. The joke is that he has no discernible gift save a knack for self-advertisement; the more depressing joke is that this crumb of talent turns out to be enough. He calls himself Mr. Brainwash and fills an abandoned television studio with sub-Warholian dreck of his own devising. Art scavengers lured by the smell of publicity line up open the jaws of their wallets and feast. ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" could and should have been an excoriating work. It isnt often that I wish a high-minded Marxist had been in charge of a motion picture but who else would you trust with the spectacle of subversive activity being commandeered and fetishized by the capitalist machinery that it was meant to undermine? This doesnt apply just to Guetta who still believes bless him that rehashed images of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis retain the power to mock and shock and who long before the movie is done dwindles from a doting eccentric into a tiring bore; it also applies to Banksy himself or at any rate to the moment when his paintings found their way onto the walls of Sothebys. To forge a million pounds worth of fake British banknotes with the Queens head replaced by that of Diana Princess of Wales is a definable feat of guerrilla art. But to have your print of Kate Moss sold by a London auction house for ninety-six thousand pounds of real money whatever you choose to do with it means that you have been press-ganged from the street where you roamed free. As a study in prankhood this Banksy film cant touch ""F for Fake"" Orson Welless 1974 movie about an art forger. Welles both conspired with his untrustworthy subject and held him at arms length like a conjurer with his rabbit and you came out dazzled by the sleight whereas ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" feels dangerously close to the promotion of a cult--almost dare one say it of a brand. Nothing by Banksy or his acolytes would have been remotely alarming to Marcel Duchamp or to Tristan Tzara; what would have struck them was the means by which a Banksy image can be reproduced--the sudden velocity at which its impact can travel whether online or through the eyes of a hundred cell phones. That is what binds ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" unexpectedly to ""Kick-Ass"" the sense both arousing and disconcerting that whatever you want to be whether its an artist a superhero or a mystery man all you need is the nerve to exhibit that desire.

Aaron Johnson and Chloe Moretz in Kick-Ass. Kick-Ass Its Hit Girl who packs the real punch Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 16 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Kick-Ass Directed by Matthew Vaughn Written by Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman Starring Aaron Johnson Chloe Grace Moretz Nicolas Cage Classification 18A Kick-Ass is some kind of twisted fun. Fun because this is a comic-book movie with loads of octane and enough smarts to parody the genre even while exploiting it. Twisted because the real star its scene-stealer supreme is a force of good charged with shooting and stabbing and beating and otherwise obliterating scores of bad guys not unusual in itself except that our virtuous agent happens to be a prepubescent 11-year old who does her lethal handiwork while swearing like a drunken sailor. Say hello if you dare to ""Hit Girl"" and prepare to be mildly disturbed in the name of zippy entertainment. Welcome to Kiddies Kill Bill. Twisted too is the genesis of the project. The creator of the comic is Mark Millar the Scot who wrote Wanted; the director is Matthew Vaughn the Brit who made Layer Cake and these two along with a largely British cast are all intent on out-Americaning the Americans at the Yanks own game. So the setting is New York where we meet a familiar figure in Dave the high-school nerd (Aaron Johnson) a Brillo-haired lad ""whose only superpower is being invisible to girls."" Actually thats a bit immodest - his onanistic prowess in front of a computer screen one hand on the mouse and the other strategically lower is quite extraordinary even by lonely teen standards. Otherwise though Dave is just your classic loser who accepts his daily muggings as lifes due course. That is until he doffs his specs dons a green wetsuit with yellow piping and transforms himself into Kick-Ass the superhero striding manfully down the mean streets whereupon oops Kick-Ass promptly gets his ass kicked by the mugger du jour. He awakens in the hospital body bruised but ego intact. His next outing is similar in execution yet superior in result Watching this wacko a cellphone videographer posts him and his costume on YouTube the clip goes viral and instantly Kick-Ass is that most modern of celebrities - the all-fame-and-no-talent variety. Hes even caught the attention of Frank the mob boss the evildoer whos convinced this evil-fighter is a threat to his dirty business. Better yet buoyed by the attention a more confident Dave is rising in the eyes of Katie the hottest babe in school. She used to think him invisible; now she thinks hes gay and anoints him her new BFF. Hey its a promotion - our boy is happy in that closet. This is the fun part sending up the comic-book conventions and slicing in a little social satire too. Then comes something else entirely. Turns out theres a pair of real superheroes out there not wannabes like Kick-Ass but the genuine and genuinely disturbed article. Meet the Macreadys father Damon (Nicolas Cage) and diminutive daughter Mindy (Chloe Grace Moretz). By day the doting papa instructs his beloved charge on the workings of every weapon in his mighty arsenal. By night armed to the teeth the twosome metamorphose into Big Daddy and yes Hit Girl he in his Batmanesque getup and she with her short skirt Clara Bow wig and that oh-so-potty-mouth. Facing them wicked heads roll like gutter balls down a packed alley. Cage plays the devoted dad with demented tenderness but its the tiny Moretz who steals the picture if not our hearts. Usually killer children are confined to horror flicks and presented as bad seeds or the progeny of the damned. Not here. This child is goodness without mercy at once sacred and profane a vigilante Barbie who has grown righteous before she has grown breasts. Sociologists will have a field day with Hit Girl. Meanwhile back in the wannabe camp Dave finds a competing nerd in the mobsters son Chris who can afford a spiffier costume and much flashier wheels. Suddenly the movie switches back to the fun side of the tracks briefly until the two halves merge in a bloody and surprisingly dark climax. There when the smoke clears another chapter beckons and for once the promise of a sequel doesnt feel like a threat.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Just because ""Kick-Ass"" has a winning 11- year-old girl as one of its most unforgettable characters doesnt mean Matthew Vaughns crazed ride of a flick is for kids. It so isnt. Its potty-mouthed and dementedly violent in the way that films based on comics so often are. R-rated the movie is best for adults whose inner teen still aches to right wrongs but doesnt have the skill set to wreak havoc on the bad guys. Co-written by Vaughn and Jane Goldman the movie is based on Mark Millar and John S. Romita Jr.s comic about a teen named Dave Lizewski who wonders ""Why dont real people try to be superheroes?"" Then he becomes one. Then he learns why. ""Meanwhile. . . ."" The playful Vaughn employs titles that bespeak his films pop-literary roots. ""Meanwhile. . . ."" A father trains his young daughter in the lethal art of payback and disguise. The three characters cross paths and find a common foe in New York mobster Frank DAmico (Mark Strong). Christopher Mintz-Plasse so funny as McLovin in ""Superbad"" portrays Chris DAmico the whiny mob scion out to prove himself to his lethal dad. Each time a new big-screen adaptation of a comic book (or graphic novel) arrives we return to ponder the appeal of comic books and their masked crime fighters. Remember last years ""Watchmen""? So the return here might seem merely cyclical. But its got more oomph than that. Self-reinvention might be considered part of the American dream or fantasy. If a personality reboot takes the form of a kind of self-evasion -- whats with the masks the rubber suits the superhero drag? -- thats all the more interesting. But ""super"" is relative when it comes to Daves fresh identity. Hes got no powers to speak of unless you consider a mix of optimism and naivete a gift. Hes not buff. He just thinks he might want to do something when bad things unfold. Pouty-lipped Aaron Johnson portrays the endearingly average high-schooler with an nice mix of open-hearted and randy desires. His crush Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) hardly knows hes there. When she finally notices him she deems him her new best ""gay"" friend. Nicolas Cage is a hoot a hollar and a fright as Damon Mac ready a.k.a. Big Daddy. How can he be otherwise? Hes a good cop gone mad. The movie offers another reason people dont don capes and crusade through their own Gotham Cities You need a deeply personal reason to take the hits but also to mete out the punishment that comes with the territory. Theres a lot of ouch here. What Macready does to daughter Mindy (Chloe Grace Moretz) is nothing short of indoctrination. In our world Hit Girl would be the double-X version of a child soldier. She loves her butterfly knife. She digs her dads arsenal. Director Vaughn has a fine feel for the cultural moment. Social media smartphones and obsessive info-munching take Daves wet-suit-wearing baton-wielding good guy viral. He earns the name Kick-Ass. In motion-picture pitch- speak Vaughn has described this adrenalized rush as ""Superbad"" meets ""Kill Bill."" Thanks to a scene of magnificently choreographed mayhem wed toss ""The Silence of the Lambs"" into the whirling Mixmaster of pop-cult nods. Vaughns movie is a homage. Its a send-up. No its an exquisite cocktail of appreciation and originality. Its . . . well the title gets it right. ""KICK-ASS.""

Then along comes Kick-Ass a comic-book adaptation that is more intelligent than its title suggests.Nerdy dude with no powers decides he wants to dress up and fight crime Thats actually been done not very well in the Damon Wayans misfire Blankman. Kick-Ass has more up its sleeve. It plays with teen comedy conventions. It flaunts its adrenaline addiction. Most important it proves adept at juggling tones Ultraviolent and funny Kick-Ass can get as sordid as the Knight is dark but it never strays far from its pulpy wiseacre core.Our hero (Aaron Johnson) a sex-starved teenage comics geek wonders why a regular guy cant put on some colorful duds and go do some good. Hes a Clark Kent whose Lois Lane (Lyndsy Fonseca) thinks hes gay. He gets beaten within an inch of his life in his first crime-fighting foray. He chugs along anyway builds a cult following via cellphone videographers and ends up face-to-face with a far more lethal do-it-yourself vigilante. Movie Information Kick-AssRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Matthew VaughnActors Aaron Johnson Nicolas Cage Chloe Grace Moretz Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Frank DAmicoRun time 117 minutesMPAA rating R (strong violence language sexual content)Synopsis What happens when you take the super out of superhero? Normal teen Dave Lizewski has the answer It hurts. This movies based on the graphic novel of the same name.More movies from GuideLive.comEnter Nicolas Cage not as gleefully unhinged as his recent Bad Lieutenant but still refreshingly vanity-free and loopy. Cage plays Big Daddy a former clean cop hellbent on destroying the mobsters who set him up and brought him down. His mustache needs help his costume is a nod toward Batman and his daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) is a pint-size mayhem machine trained by Papa to kill at will. She also swears like a sailor a trait that has some people fretting about the end of Western civilization. Not sure how the comic incongruity of a potty-mouthed movie kid spells our imminent doom but hey different strokes for different folks. Lets just say its not for kids.Directed by Matthew Vaughn (whose Layer Cake remains one of the unsung crime films of the last decade) and based on the comic book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. Kick-Ass has shameless fun swaggering across a tricky tightrope. It understands the basics of comic-book mythology - the broadly stroked back stories the looming shadow of family the eternal need for heroes and villains. More important it uses the film medium to accentuate the very qualities that nose-in-the-air comics haters have sniffed at for decades. It relishes its carnage. Its fast and its primal.Kick-Ass is also very modern; it knows exactly which buttons its pushing and it doesnt care who might object. The film has the courage of its genre convictions. It doesnt have even a whiff of market testing. It does everything on its own terms and in this age of McMansion movies thats a super accomplishment. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(Dan Smith) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 16 2010 Summer has arrived early with ""Kick-Ass"" a profane ultra-violent surprisingly winning adaptation of Mark Millars comic-book series. Directed by Matthew Vaughnwith verve and a crisp color-saturated visual sense ""Kick-Ass"" should delight fans of the original comics and garden-variety action junkies as well. Suggested subtitle ""Iron Man You Just Got Served."" This StoryKick-Ass This isnt your ordinary justice leagueCo-screenwriter talks Hit-GirlFind Kick-Ass showtimesWatch the trailerView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Omnipresent newcomer Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski a bespectacled mild-mannered high school student who after being mugged for the umpteenth time wonders why more everyday people dont dress up like superheroes and become vigilantes. Soon thereafter Dave is dressing up in a green wet suit yellow rubber gloves and work boots appropriating the title of the movie as his superhero alter ego and . . . pretty much getting his tushie whipped. When Dave is joined by two mysterious cohorts named Big Daddy and Hit-Girl however his success rate begins to spike. In real life (or at least the movies version of it) Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are Damon Macready and his 11-year-old daughter Mindy who share a passion for knives guns and heavy-duty ordnance. When we meet them Damon is shooting Mindy in the chest (with blanks) to teach her how to take a blow. Although Chloe Grace Moretzs foul-mouthed portrayal of the plucky Mindy has already drawn fire in the blogosphere Mindys self-reliance and confidence result in a weirdly reassuring portrait of a young girl whos able to defend herself. Whats more her relationship with her father isnt cynical but genuinely touching (and Nicolas Cage in his Big Daddy persona delivers a pretty funny Adam West imitation as the caped Big Daddy). Too often movies as besotted with violence as ""Kick-Ass"" simply ratchet up the action at the expense of everything else. To his credit Vaughn (best known for the graphic novel adaptation ""Stardust"") makes sure that the stylized progressively more fantastical set pieces here are leavened with compensatory humor a gratifyingly playful tone and characters blessed with smarts and lovability. Whats more he stages ""Kick-Ass"" with the fluidity and flutter of a comic book itself The films penultimate shootout filmed in flashes of darkness and strobe-lit mayhem looks like a series of pen-and-ink panels brought to outrageous outsize life.

The most amazing superpower youll encounter in ""Kick-Ass"" isnt that it enlivens one of the dullest movie genres or that it scores laughs out of children plummeting to their deaths getting shot in the chest and using language that would make a drill sergeant blush. No prepare for amazement This thing makes Nicolas Cage cool again. Far from falling into the same category as the Spider- and X-Men movies (all of them as predictable as a trip to the grocery store) ""Kick-Ass"" is a brutally funny deconstruction a hybrid of ""Watchmen"" and ""Superbad"" filtered through John Woo. Its a boisterously original piece of entertainment . . . that isnt for everyone. Note the rating which should be triple-R as in Really Remarkably R. A nerdy high school kid (Aaron Johnson about whom you will be hearing much more) tires of being mugged orders himself a scuba suit online and styles himself a crime fighting warrior named Kick-Ass. Almost immediately he finds himself getting stabbed and run over by a car. MORE Hit-Girl talks with PopWrap That sequence is played as serious drama though other episodes of bloodiness are surreal black comedy. ""Kick-Ass"" never leaves you in much doubt about what your reaction should be but as fun as it is you can sense the lurch from gear to gear as it shifts tone. One minute for instance Kick-Ass and another fake kid superhero called Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse who will introduce a boot to your posterior if you ever call him McLovin again) are singing Gnarls Barkley; the next theyre in serious danger. The movie also suffers from the bland villainy of a snarling drug dealer played by Mark Strong who was also a bore in ""Sherlock Holmes."" Ah but what wonders hes up against not just Kick-Ass (whose shtick becomes kind of a bore in the middle of the movie especially when he is mewling around an insipid would-be girlfriend) but two more ingeniously imagined homebrewed heroes. I hesitate to spoil the details since discovering who they really are is one of the movies central pleasures -- but all of this comes up early on and its impossible to talk about the movies main story otherwise. Suffice it to say that the drug dealer is a target of revenge from an ex-cop (a very funny Nicolas Cage) who is pretending to be a Batman-style masked avenger named Big Daddy and his sweet 11-year-old daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz). Real name Mindy. Superhero identity Hit Girl. Hit Girl may be the coolest assassin since Jules in ""Pulp Fiction."" If you get a chance to wager on this years hot Halloween costume bet the farm on her. Shes the baddest funniest killingest and coolest female superhero ever. (Sorry Elektra.) Shes so beyond awesome that once weve seen what she can do she hijacks the whole movie. Director Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake"") plays coy with her but eventually delivers with three of the most brilliantly executed (and I do mean executed) attack scenes of recent years. Vaughn the former protege of the formerly promising ""Sherlock Holmes"" director Guy Ritchie may turn out to be one of the most vivid and original action movie makers. His visuals as in ""Layer Cake"" are punctuated with moments of startling beauty (note the scene where Hit Girl looms in the darkness blinding her enemies with blades of light) and his flair for picking a soundtrack is up there with Quentin Tarantino. (I particularly enjoyed his demented use of a punk cover of the la-la-la theme to the 60s kid show ""The Banana Splits."") Vaughn will go anywhere for a joke and comedy is like an explorer If it isnt staking out new territory it isnt doing its job. A tiny murderess in a fuchsia wig using the one swear word that is still a bit shocking (at least to Americans)? Youll experience a sharp intake of breath then expel it with a whoop.

"Kick-Ass A violent five-alarm four-star fantasy | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesKick-Ass A violent five-alarm four-star fantasyKick-Ass is an assault on the senses with bullets firing blades slashing and bodies thudding bleeding and burning at every turn.A scene from Kick-Ass a superhero film in which no one actually acquires any supernatural abilities.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 15 2010Kick-Ass (out of 4)Starring Nicolas Cage Mark Strong Aaron Johnson Chloe Grace Moretz and Clark Duke. Directed by Matthew Vaughn. At theatres throughout the GTA.Kick-Ass is a five-alarm fire that deserves a four-star rating.It also requires a warning. Despite its comic-book origins and socko entertainment values this is not a movie for children or the easily offended.Article Continued BelowKick-Ass is an assault on the senses with bullets firing blades slashing and bodies thudding bleeding and burning at every turn. The violence is most graphically seen and felt in the turbulence of Chloe Grace Moretz just 11 when she made this who plays a sociopathic pre-teen vigilante aptly named Hit Girl.The film by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) succeeds as a violent fantasy about our perilous and fretful times where regular citizens feel compelled to take action against a social order rotting from within. Its by no means a novel concept as the recent Canadian film Defendor (just out on DVD) and other movies have amply demonstrated.I rate Kick-Ass so highly because it has more to say than these other vigilante movies although its a very cynical message - the implications of Hit Girl alone could keep a platoon of psychiatrists and sociologists talking for days.The film is post-modern surgery into the superhero myth driving a scalpel into the warped logic of misanthropic killers who masquerade as civic do-gooders.Yet at the same time it celebrates these dark impulses urging us to cheer the notion that two wrongs can make one right. The action scenes bounce between the style of Tarantino to the stupidity of Looney Tunes and some of them verge on torture porn.Feel guilty for watching Kick-Ass but pass the popcorn anyway.Screenwriter Jane Goldman (who penned Vaughns earlier Stardust) twists genre convention as did the source comic by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. that she draws from.Unlike most other superhero sagas no one actually acquires any supernatural abilities in Kick-Ass. There are no exploding planets radioactive spiders or careless gamma rays turning dorks into dynamos. Dorks remain dorks and they dont even acquire the self-awareness that make all those other freaks in tights so tediously pious.""With no power comes no responsibility"" shouts self-anointed teen hero Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) who plays the character Kick-Ass of the title. Hes a ninja wannabe in a green ski mask and matching mail-order costume.Dave doesnt understand why people dont simply become superheroes the way they do in comic books and hes out to change that despite lacking any semblance of brawn.Hes not completely nutso ""My only super power was being invisible to girls"" he tells us via voiceover. His one hope of getting close to the girl of his affections a hottie named Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) is to pretend hes gay.Yet Dave wades into battle with the scum of the Earth without thinking of the consequences and consequently gets his ass kicked to within an inch of his life.Fortunately for Dave there are two other vigilantes on the streets of New York (or rather Toronto beneath the mask) who are even more deluded than he is but also more capable. Theyre a father-daughter team a Batman clone known as Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and his hell-raising ""honey bunny"" an 11-year-old stone cold killer called Hit Girl (Moretz).Sporting a purple wig and a black mask and waving knives and guns with abandon shes as cute as a kitten and as dangerous as a scorpion. Shes also got a mouth that could shock a longshoreman or give a censor (or parent) the cold sweats.Dave may be working a fantasy but Big Daddy is nursing a grudge. Hes a former NYPD cop who really has it in for local drug lord Frank DAmico (Mark Strong). The two actually have child-rearing issues in common DAmicos closeted son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has his own superhero delusions which he expresses in the flamboyant garb of a character he calls Red Mist.Were never quite sure what to make of Kick-Ass since Vaughn keeps us guessing about how grounded in reality the movie is supposed to be. Even as Big Daddy plots his next vigilante attack from deep within his weapon-filled lair hes drawing comic-book panels that explain his previous life as a Manhattan copper.Theres a curious and disturbing lack of conscience in all these characters. One of them looks upon a scene of mayhem and wonders if it will disrupt his planned viewing of the final episode of TVs Lost.What also do we think of a soundtrack that veers from the gospel reverence of Elvis Presley to the manic theme song from The Banana Splits like an iPod shuffle programmed by a maniac?The blurring between whats real and whats sketched between thick white lines hasnt been this woozy since Terry Zwigoff shuffled his sad-sack characters through Ghost World in 2001. Vaughn has made a comic-book movie both for fanboys and philosophers.Kick-Ass also deftly satirizes societys increasingly obsession with and dependence on the online world over the real world. Dave isnt taken seriously as a vigilante until a cell-phone video of him getting whupped is launched to YouTube. Then he becomes famous simply for being famous just like so many of todays so-called celebrities and people suddenly want to be just as big a loser as he is.Its just another reason why I get such a kick out of Kick-Ass although your mileage may well vary.

(Dan Smith) Joe Neumaier Thursday April 15 2010 341 PM Title Kick-Ass In ""Kick-Ass"" an action-comedy about real-world superheroes with no powers but plenty of attitude Nicolas Cage uses the same halting pompous intonations Adam West did to intimidate bad guys in the 1960s ""Batman"" TV show. While thats not the geekiest thing in this thuddingly awful movie it is the funniest. And thats ... not ... good chum.The films calling card is that its toughest most foul-mouthed vigilante is Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) an 11-year-old tomboy trained by her father Big Daddy (Cage) for a life of fighting crime. She curses takes a bullet and cuts up villains and ""Kick-Ass"" - based on a graphic novel - thinks its so brave and bold. But its more like the title character a dweeb who just thinks hes tough.Nerdy New York high-schooler Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a comics boy wondering why no one actually puts on a costume to battle criminals. So he creates an alter ego called Kick-Ass your friendly neighborhood cat-saver carjack-stopper and hero at large. A MySpace page is his Bat-signal.Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are already around though making life miserable for a powerful mobster (Mark Strong). Their origin story is linked with the mobsters rise to power so Big Daddy vows revenge. When Kick-Ass - who after being run over by a car becomes (slightly) impervious to pain - gets mixed up in their vengeance the mobsters son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) becomes Red Mist the nemesis of Kick-Ass.It all feels like ""Watchmen Jr."" yet director Matthew Vaughn avoids that movies serious tone in favor of geek-universe chic. As a result ""Kick-Ass"" will appeal most to those who know Jack Nicholsons Joker catch phrases writers from Marvel Comics silver age and the musical marches of Danny Elfman.Genre fans may say the uninitiated have no business even walking in. Except a movie like this shouldnt merely piggyback on pop-cultural references especially when its constant voice-over and leads - Cage Mintz-Plasse and the pimply-voiced Johnson - are so arch and irritating. Still for nonbelievers there are a few punchy fistfights and a feisty performance from 13-year-old Moretz.Shes the breakout here but her characters vocabulary and viciousness have caused some to worry whether her role is appropriate for a kid and whether the R-rated flick will draw kids only to batter them with violence. Parents should know that despite its marketing this isnt a ""Spy Kids""-like spoof but Hit-Girl putting her own spin on the hit-man profession at least does what the movies title promises.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

If youre ready to be offended ""Kick-Ass"" is ready to oblige. Its villains are the usual Italian-American stereotypes. Its heroine is an 11-year-old girl who is either cursing someone shooting someone or getting beaten up by someone. The violence is unending. But any movie called ""Kick-Ass""  is not particularly worried about  giving offense. Kick-Ass (R) Lionsgate (117 min.) Directed by Matthew Vaughn. With Aaron Johnson Christopher Mintz-Plasse Chloe Grace Moretz Nicolas Cage. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Two stars Ratings note The film contains gory violence strong language and substance abuse. Actually movies like this yearn to do just that. The impulse crosses all genres -- comedies slasher films action pictures -- but remains the same. Set the audience up to wonder ""Theyre not going to really do that are they?"" Then do it. ""Kick-Ass"" tries to follow that strategy from the start as it details the onanistic life of a standard-issue dweeb Dave. He loves comic books and dreams of being a superhero. So one day he puts on a costume and goes out to save his city. Manhattan? Meet Kick-Ass. But then Kick-Ass meets some caped crusaders -- the father/daughter team of Big Daddy and Hit Girl. And then they all meet up with a gang of lowlifes who try to put an end to their crimefighting via switchblade machine gun and bazooka. There are however two problems with the can-you-top-this school of outrageous filmmaking and ""Kick-Ass"" never quite figures out the answer to either. The first is to be really outrageous you have to go way over-the-top -- so far that as in ""Kill Bill"" (or Asian horror films) the surreal excess actually tempers the offense. ""Kick-Ass"" remains merely gory. The second if youre going to play this game you have to keep doubling down. ""Kick-Ass"" cant. The fights never grow in complexity; halfway through the director has nothing to add. There are some pleasures. Nicolas Cage who always has a good time no matter what anyone else is doing channels Adam West and William Shatner as Big Daddy; young Chloe Grace Moretz has a great look (and a tiresomely foul mouth) as Hit Girl. But Aaron Johnson is bland as Kick-Ass (and his costume is neither bad enough to be funny nor good enough to be cool). Christopher Mintz-Plasse fails to escape his McLovin image and the villain is the sort of idiot whod never have survived Season 1 of ""The Sopranos."" But director Matthew Vaughn doesnt seem to care about that. Any more than he minds that his New York heroes are quite obviously driving down Torontos Yonge Street. Or that Big Daddy is a nearly actionable rip-off of Batman or that no one but Quentin Tarantino should be allowed to reuse Ennio Morricone scores. There are a few mildly amusing jokes here and plenty of slow-motion violence; the very undemanding will have their demands met. Yet ultimately ""Kick-Ass"" tries to outrage and only annoys; attempts to excite and only disgusts. Like its hero its a wannabe.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Kick-Ass Action comedy. Starring Aaron Johnson Christopher Mintz-Plasse Nicolas Cage Mark Strong and Chloe Moretz. Directed by Matthew Vaughn. (R. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Kick-Ass"" lives up to the promise of its title but its better than its title too. Its not an innocuous comedy. It doesnt talk down to audiences. It brings together several popular strains of contemporary moviemaking and combines them into one big shameless audacious compulsively watchable irresistibly likable piece of pure entertainment. Its a comic book action movie but its not just that. Its also a teen comedy with the honest outrageousness of an ""American Pie"" or a ""Superbad."" At the same time somebody has been watching Tarantino movies because ""Kick-Ass"" has the crazy outsize cartoonlike violence of a Tarantino film plus the knowing sense of humor. Theres a serious intelligence behind this picture and thats especially welcome in a genre usually exploited to attract people either too young to know better or too dumb to care. Intelligence equals risk. It means playing with lucrative formulas in pursuit of an actual vision. ""Kick-Ass"" takes chances and succeeds. The story - or rather the jumping-off point for the story - concerns an average high school kid Dave (Aaron Johnson) who aspires to be a superhero even though he cant fight has no super powers and no disposable income with which to outfit a bat cave. Uh-oh you might think this sounds like the recipe for something corny a gentle comedy about a boy and his dream. Forget it. Five minutes into his superhero career the same thing happens to Dave that would happen to any defenseless naif who shows up in a jumpsuit and tries to stop a robbery.

Photo Dan Smith Lionsgate Image 8 of 8 Review Thats Kick-Ass entertainment 1 / 8 Back to Gallery ""Kick-Ass"" is the third film from director Matthew Vaughn (""Star Dust"" ""Layer Cake"") whose movies though very different have in common a firm command of story. Starting with a high school kid who dresses like a superhero and calls himself ""Kick-Ass"" the movies world expands. The media get involved. Then the Internet. Organized crime is drawn into the story and so are Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz as a lethal father-and-daughter duo who in their superhero incarnations go by the names Big Daddy and Hit Girl. Cage who has been focusing in recent years on big-scale blockbusters finally finds one that calls forth the qualities of intensity and idiosyncratic humor that made audiences like him in the first place. As a cop who has had his life ruined by a mob boss (Mark Strong) Cage is a poignant figure. Yet hes also quite funny in his Big Daddy incarnation doing a blatant imitation of TVs Batman Adam West. The violence in ""Kick-Ass"" is off the charts but the thing that might make it sound especially appalling is in fact the thing that mitigates it Most of it is committed by a charming tiny 11-year-old girl. As Hit Girl Moretz kills at least 50 bad guys and its all so over the top and absurd that only the most sensitive souls will find it disturbing. Vaughn also speeds up the action during the violence and cranks up the soundtrack turning each episode into a comic set piece. Yet however grand and fantastic individual elements may become Vaughn and Jane Goldman who collaborated on the adaptation of Mark Millars comic book series keep the personal relationships grounded in recognizable reality. For example the ridiculous friendship that develops between Dave and the girl of his dreams because she thinks hes gay. Or the family dynamic between the suave ruthless mobster and his wonderfully nerdy son. Christopher Mintz-Plasse who achieved screen immortality as McLovin in ""Superbad"" plays the son and with his cultivated aura of goofiness and misplaced self-satisfaction hes made for the screen. Likewise though the events in ""Kick-Ass"" are extreme we can recognize the violence and ridiculousness as well the vanity and the craving of the central characters. This is our world too but a wild funhouse version of it - emphasis on the fun part. -- Advisory This movie contains nudity sexual situations extreme violence and drug use.

ABOUT THE MOVIEKick-Ass   (out of four)Stars Aaron Johnson Chloe Moretz Nicolas Cage Christopher Mintz-Plasse Mark StrongDirector Matthew VaughnDistributor LionsgateRating R for brutal violence throughout pervasive language sexual content nudity and drug use some involving childrenRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Why doesnt anyone in real life try to become a superhero? This may not be a question many of us have pondered but its one that obsesses the teenage crime fighter in Kick-Ass. Years ago Kick-Ass would have fallen squarely into the cult-movie category. But given the appetite for something new in the action-adventure genre it probably will be a hit. A brief warning to the squeamish The film is brutal and often playfully so. If you dont like laughing while blood spurts stay away. EDGY BLODY POTTY-MOUTHED Aint that a Kick-Ass film CONTROVERSY A word uttered by Chloe Moretz TRAILER Meet the superheroes of Kick-Ass Based on the comic book by Mark Millar and John S. Romita Jr. it both pays tribute to and sends up conventions of the superhero genre. Peppering an action flick with comedy is hardly original but the mocking tone and off-kilter vibe set this film apart. It even has a hearty dose of charm thanks mostly to the most outrageous performance by a child in recent memory. The titular character is Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) an ordinary high school student who is bound and determined to be a superhero despite a lack of any discernible superpowers. He dons a colorful wetsuit fashions a makeshift costume and heads for the streets of New York. His superhero tag? Kick-Ass. When he faces off against a tough street gang an onlooker records his foolhardy efforts on a cellphone and Dave/Kick-Ass becomes a YouTube sensation. Soon Kick-Ass merchandise is all over and the media outlets are abuzz with sightings. The adventures of the teenage Kick-Ass are often hilarious but its a father-daughter pair of vigilantes -- Big Daddy and Hit-Girl -- who steal the movie. Chloe Moretz (of (500) Days of Summer) is terrific as the fearless and foul-mouthed 11-year-old Hit-Girl. Her loving father Big Daddy is played by that master of offbeat roles Nicolas Cage. The daring duo who look like an old-school Batman and Robin have been dismantling the evil empire of organized-crime kingpin Frank DAmico (Mark Strong). Strong adds to his already impressive resume of roles in Sherlock Holmes RocknRolla Body of Lies and The Young Victoria. But as we learned watching the tales of Tony Soprano even cutthroat Mafiosi have issues with their kids. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad) plays Franks geeky son Chris who assumes his own superhero persona Red Mist to help his dad. But it is the plucky Moretz who dazzles. Even as she wields outlandish weaponry she comes off as adorable. Her devotion to her father adds a touching note amid the bloodletting and whacked-out mayhem. Kick-Ass isnt as subversive as it aspires to be starting out as an indictment of fanboy fantasies then submitting to them. But its irreverently entertaining.

At once superhuman and all too human they rise from meager surroundings to an Olympus of grandeur. Indeed their powers are born of their afflictions Peter Parkers spider bite Bruce Banners radiation overdose the useful mutations of the X-Men. So why wouldnt a teen inspired by heroes hes seen in comics and movies want to be one? In the first scene of Kick-Ass a guy in a cool Aztec-deity costume stands on a skyscraper ledge and majestically dives off. Alas his metallic wings dont work and he crashes -- splat -- into a parked car. (See five things you need to know before seeing Kick-Ass.) Dont try this at home kids. Kick-Ass -- the 2008 comic written by Mark Millar and drawn by John Romita Jr. and the new film directed by Matthew Vaughn with a script by Vaughn and Jane Goldman -- could have ended in a big ugly blood puddle too. Instead it soars jet-propelled on its central idea of matching a superheros exploits with the grinding reality of urban teen life and on the aerodynamic smoothness of the films style. (See the 100 best movies of all time.) To apotheosize the clichA(c)s of the genre while subverting them is a neat trick but the Kick-Ass cadre pulls it off. This is a violent R-rated drama that comments cogently on the impulses -- noble venal or twisted -- that lead people to help or hurt others. Kick-Ass kicks beaucoup dass in some of the dandiest most punishing stunt work this side of Hong Kong but it forces the grownups in the audience to acknowledge that the action is as troubling as it is gorgeous. (Preteens should definitely wait a few years before seeing this.) The result is a work that spills out of itself to raise issues about all superhero characters all action pictures. Millar isnt boasting when he writes in the making-of book that Kick-Ass could ""redefine superhero movies in the same way Pulp Fiction redefined crime movies."" (See the 10 worst video game movies.) Millar one of the most gifted writers in comics did the Wanted story that became a snazzy film in 2008. So hed already done his share -- along with Alan Moore (Watchmen) Neil Gaiman (Stardust) and Frank Miller (Sin City) -- of redefining the action-movie cosmos. Here though he addresses basic questions What is the effect of popular culture on the young who consume it? Does a kid just devour superhero stories and then void them like fast food in paper or disc form? Or does he take them to heart as a life guide? And if he does say create a costume and with no special skills confront the bad guys -- what are the consequences? See the top 10 post-Oscar busts. See the Cartoons of the Week.

And the letter A makes all the difference in the world when the hero inserts it in the middle of a one-word note temo that he has written to himself. Then I fear becomes I love you. These are clever details in a drama that transcends cleverness. This beautiful film directed with subtlety and grace by Juan Jose Campanella really is about moving from fear to love. This thriller by Argentine director Juan Jose Campanella stars Ricardo Darin as a retired criminal court investigator who decides to write a novel based on a 25-year-old unresolved rape and murder case. The story begins in contemporary Buenos Aires when Benjamin Esposito a retired criminal investigator played by Ricardo Darin decides to revisit a cold case--the brutal murder of a young woman--by writing a novel about it. In doing so he revisits his still-warm case of love for Irene Menendez Hastings (Soledad Villamil) a Cornell-educated lawyer now a judge with a husband and children who was a beautiful young prosecutor when they worked together a quarter of a century ago. If you were diagramming the script which the director and Eduardo Sacheri adapted from Mr. Sacheris novel you might divide it between these two elements an unsolved murder and unresolved love. No movie in memory though is less schematic. Elements intertwine. Feelings emerge recede resurface. Wit and humor--and remnants of hope--sustain lives burdened with regret. The movie is very much a murder mystery and very much a love story--in fact a pair of stories about obsessive love lived out by two men with ostensibly different attitudes toward the past and very different outcomes. Its also a meditation on the passage of time and the uses of memory an argument for never looking back--""Youll have a thousand pasts and no future"" the murder victims husband tells Benjamin (with what turns out to be startling irony)--and in a romantic vein an advertisement for acting on love at whatever time of life. Exceptional movies are often about many things and thats certainly the case with this one. I cant recall a more dramatic interrogation than the scene in which a suddenly ferocious Irene tries to Benjamins astonishment to break an implacable suspect. Or a more engagingly odd couple than Benjamin and his colleague Sandoval an investigator with a fondness for wry jokes and booze. Or a more poignant leave-taking when Irene and Benjamin embrace but dont kiss and fear trumps love. (All of it is enhanced by Felix Montis burnished sometimes brooding cinematography.) ENLARGE Ricardo Darin as Benjamin Esposito in The Secret in Their Eyes Sony Pictures Classics Of the two previous films Ive seen starring Ricardo Darin ""Son of the Bride"" which was also directed by Mr. Campanella is out of print on DVD--please Sony Pictures Classics reissue it--but ""Nine Queens"" remains available and Ive discussed it in more detail elsewhere on this page. A formidable actor with commanding star quality Mr. Darin who is in his sixties plays Benjamin in his thirties persuasively--the actors vitality is more important than his young-age makeup. In the present-day passages he makes the hero an aging sophisticate whose urbane demeanor conceals suppressed but far from extinguished passion. Ms. Villamils Irene is quick-witted and alluring in the past and present alike. In a film of impeccable performances three other standouts are Guillermo Francella who plays Sandoval; Pablo Rago as Morales the bereaved husband whose love was almost unfathomably pure; and Javier Godino as the prime suspect Isidoro Gomez a figure of pure malevolence at a time in the 1970s when Argentinas military dictatorship was bringing evil back into style. Kick-Ass Where are the snows of yesteryear and the splurge guns of ""Bugsy Malone""? Hyperviolence is the dominant mode of ""Kick-Ass"" Matthew Vaughns low-budget excursion into Tarantino-style chaos for teens. The film based on the comic by Mark Millar and John S. Romita Jr. is grungily stylish and often funny at least for a while though all of the caveats and contradictions that apply to Tarantino films apply here One mans--or boys--stylization is anothers profane unrelenting and tedious brutality. Watch a clip from the film ""Kick-Ass."" Video courtesy of Lionsgate. The superhero of the title played by Aaron Johnson is the creation of Dave Lizewski a dorky high school kid who desperately wants to amount to something more than his wistful self. Dave dons a turquoise and yellow wet suit that he bought on the Internet arms himself with a couple of billy sticks goes out into the world to fight crime and is promptly beaten to a bloody pulp. In the age of instant celebrity however the heedless Kick-Ass becomes a media phenomenon and his fame inspires him to feats of heroism that are certifiable in every sense of the word. The movies stand-in for Gotham City swarms with competing superheroes Big Daddy and Hit-Girl a father-and-daughter duo in the Batman and Robin mold (hes played by Nicolas Cage and she with sensational verve by Chloe Grace Moretz); and Kick-Asss teen nemesis Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). The director who wrote the screenplay with Jane Goldman doesnt do well with his cast when they arent in action mode and the basic joke grows as saggy as Dave Lizewskis suit. On another level though ""Kick-Ass"" stands as an intriguing fantasy of social networking. To achieve superhero status you simply put up your own Web site announce it on MySpace and Facebook and youre on your mythic way. Exit Through the Gift Shop Purringly narrated by Rhys Ifans ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is the directorial debut of the supersecretive--and supersuccessful--English street artist Banksy. This faux-documentary is droll aerosol-thin and ultrameta a movie about a movie that supposedly was but actually wasnt being made about Banksy by his amiably bonkers Boswell a compulsive French videographer named Thierry Guetta. ENLARGE Banksy in Exit Through the Gift Shop. Paranoid Pictures The clueless Thierry character comes on like Andy Warhol on vitamins a wannabe artist--and proprietor of a Los Angeles clothing store--who manages to be both endearingly modest and amusingly grandiose as he promises to create an epic documentary on street art. That he fails miserably is part of a witty conceit that soon gets wittier. ""It was then"" the hooded Banksy intones in an electronically-altered voice ""that I realized maybe Thierry wasnt actually a filmmaker he was maybe just someone with mental problems that happened to have a camera."" Maybe he was but Thierry moves on to making his own street art--calling himself Mr. Brainwash he turns out epic numbers of Warholesque ripoffs--and Banksys film moves on to a deft send-up of artists art critics and the commodification of contemporary art junk. Of the testimonials to Thierrys lame show which he calls ""Life Is Beautiful"" the funniest is the most halting ""The jokes on...I dont know who the jokes on really. I dont know if there is a joke."" Exactly. DVD FOCUS Nine Queens (2000) ENLARGE Theres no honor among the Buenos Aires thieves of ""Nine Queens"" an entertaining Spanish-language debut feature by Fabian Bielinsky. Its hard to tell the con man from the mark but thats what were asked to do after two swindlers join forces to sell a supposedly rare set of forged stamps. (The stamps are the nine queens of the title.) Ricardo Darin is Marcos an experienced scammer searching for a smart associate who can learn the tricks of the trade. I wasnt smart enough to see what was going on in Mr. Bielinskys Mamet-like house of mirrors until the very end. It Should Happen to You (1954) ENLARGE In the dawn of self-promotion when the Internet didnt exist and gossip was confined to gossip columns Judy Holliday starred as Gladys Glover in this comedy about a woman who having lost her modeling job seeks to make herself famous by putting her name on a billboard overlooking Columbus Circle in New York. The only one who questions her approach is Pete Sheppard a filmmaker played by Jack Lemmon. George Cukor directed from a script by Garson Kanin. With Peter Lawford Connie Gilchrist and as themselves on a TV show Constance Bennett Ilka Chase and Wendy Barrie. Style Wars (1983) ENLARGE Not faux but truly groundbreaking this documentary about graffiti artists was first broadcast by PBS in 1983. At that time New York Citys subways were awash with graffiti and its citizens were ablaze with understandable anger over what they saw as rampant defacement of public property and a defilement of civic life. The films director the late Tony Silver and his producing partner Henry Chalfant saw more and documented it well in their prescient study of the taggers their exuberant art and the roots of hip-hop culture. Among those interviewed are taggers Seen Kase 2 and Dondi and Mayor Ed Koch.

"Movie review aKick-Assa - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ViolenceMovie review aKick-AssaItas a shrewd mixture of slickly made comic-book violence unmistakable sweetness and ear-splitting profanity that is poised to be a popular culture phenomenon.April 16 2010|Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Kick-Ass"" is the movie our parents warned us about the movie you dont want your children to see. A highly seductive enterprise thats equal parts disturbing and enticing it will leave you speechless because its characters a especially a 12-year-old virtuoso of violence named Hit Girl a are anything but. This shrewd mixture of slick comic-book mayhem unmistakable sweetness and ear-splitting profanity is poised to be a popular culture phenomenon because of its exact sense of the fantasies of the young male fanboy population. Directed by Matthew Vaughn and written by Jane Goldman and Vaughn this comic-book-come-to-life was not just based on a book by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. but made at the same time the original comic was being created. ""I never understood why nobody did it before me"" says teenage protagonist Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) in the voice-over that starts things off. What ""it"" is in this case is making the decision to present yourself as a superhero even though as the young man says ""my only superpower was being invisible to girls."" So its more than the desire to ""put on a mask and help people"" that turns Dave into Kick-Ass an earnest young crime fighter in an odd-looking wetsuit. He wants to impress the opposite sex especially fetching classmate Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) who at first doesnt notice him and then comes to believe hes gay. Weve seen this kind of high school bildungsroman including the currently mandatory references to masturbation more times than anyone can count but here the scenario is helped by the genuinely likable nature of the leads and by the fact that the romance provides an appealing backdrop that the more unnerving aspects of the film play out against. Its not by accident that its rated R for among other things ""strong brutal violence throughout (and) pervasive language."" For after events conspire to make Kick-Ass an Internet phenomenon who ends up fighting all kinds of crime the bad guys take notice and strike back. Led by drug kingpin Frank DAmico (Mark Strong) and his son Chris soon to be Kick-Ass nemesis Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) the hooligans and the good guys mix it up in an ultra-violent ""Kill Bill"" kind of way. As zestily orchestrated by director Vaughn who did similar work on his earlier ""Layer Cake"" this is the kind of cartoonish violence choreographed to upbeat music thats come to define modern action movie culture. What makes ""Kick-Ass"" different is that a father-and-daughter team known as Big Daddy and Hit Girl are going the vigilante route at the same time as our hero. Theyre played by Nicolas Cage and Chloe Grace Moretz in a way that already wound people up when the film opened in Britain at the end of March. Big Daddy (real name Damon Macready) loves his daughter (real name Mindy) but for reasons of his own he has turned her into a pint-size profanity-spewing killing machine in a purple wig and pleated skirt. Her language is so astonishingly crude that it has taken peoples attention away from all the killing she does which is mind-boggling as well. Yet at the same time as were unnerved by someone so young acting this way what makes this film so intriguing is that largely due to the terrific spirit and skill of young actress Moretz if you are any kind of action film fan its difficult to deny the live-wire pulp energy that plays out on screen. Its as if all the arguments about these hyper-violent films a why they are so popular what they have done to our culture a are open for business in one convenient location. It may or may not be the end of civilization as we know it but ""Kick-Ass"" certainly is Exhibit A of the here and now. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESBig Daddy Does Parent Firm ProudJune 29 1999MORE STORIES ABOUTViolenceMovieBig DaddyCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et--kickass-20100416,0,6645662.story",200,kick-ass17,kick-ass,latimes

Tons but also enough humanity to make us love these unlikely vigilantes.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune April 16 2010 -- 726am Lionsgate Star Tribune Aaron Johnson and Chloe Moretz in ""Kick-Ass"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Turn off your cell phone and your moral compass for this one. ""Kick-Ass"" is a guilty pleasure of the highest order a guns-blazing media-savvy superhero comedy designed to thrill geeks and outrage prudes. What makes it different from ""Sin City"" or the ""Kill Bill"" movies is that it features Hit Girl a moppet who swears like Joe Pesci and turns villains into corpses by the dozen a tween Tarantino. If thats a deal breaker too bad for you fuddy duddy. Youre missing a fabulously insane piece of work -- original self-aware and so cartoonishly extravagant with bloodshed that it makes a joke of hollow Hollywood violence. If you look beyond the jokes and gore youll find a strong belief in a code of honor. Honor among vigilantes perhaps but a virtue nonetheless. Directed with racy action-packed style by Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake"") the film has so much eagerness and verve that it transforms its ingredients. We wind up feeling affectionate toward some highly unlikely people beginning with Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) a garden-variety high-school nerd who decides to become a costumed comic-book hero. His origin story Hes bored. This nice modest kid dons a green scuba suit christens himself Kick-Ass and takes to the streets of New York City like a crime-fighting Kermit the Frog. Its tougher than he expected and hes promptly sent to the emergency ward emerging with a set of new titanium bones and damage to his nervous system that leaves him unable to feel pain. A true fanboy he crows ""Im just like Wolverine"" at the very moment we think it. The movie is studded with clever in-jokes that hit the bulls-eye. Kick-Ass makes a splash on YouTube and the city has a new folk hero much to the chagrin of Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl (intensely likable Chloe Moretz delivering her zingy wisecracks with a wonderful dirty good humor). Big Daddys a doting dad gone haywire tutoring his little princess in brawling knife fighting sharpshooting and lariat work to clean up the corrupt town. As many blood-spurting kinetic action scenes demonstrate shes a natural. Kick-Ass who uses nonlethal weaponry becomes the ultraviolent duos reluctant partner. Their adversary is a volatile gentleman racketeer (Mark Strong) whose morally conflicted son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) cant decide if he wants to enter the family business or join the good guys. KICK-ASS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for strong brutal violence throughout pervasive language sexual content nudity and some drug use -- some involving children. Vaughn structures the picture as an exciting series of shootouts and brawls but he lets us recuperate too. Patricia Goldsmiths comic-melodramatic script pauses for daffy interludes with Dave and his high-school crush. The story also gives us time to consider the impact of all that violence. It doesnt waste any sympathy on the villains but when our antiheroes are worked over you cant help but whimper. In the movies overall scheme though thats like worrying about a ballet stars bunions. Vaughn stages the action scenes with manic exhibitionistic joy. He makes the bodies dance and crash and bounce back like a rowdy slapstick physics lesson. Theres much to admire here from the garish color scheme to the slick flow of the editing. But the conversation about this film will center around Moretz whose work here puts her alongside ""Taxi Drivers"" Jodie Foster and ""The Exorcists"" Linda Blair as a juvenile actress in a taboo-busting breakthrough role. All I can say is that she provides some of the best delivery of hard-boiled dialogue that ever graced an action thriller. Cage provides some cockeyed moments channeling TVs Batman Adam West but its the superlative Moretz who gives ""Kick-Ass"" its sizzle and charm.

Chloe Moretz a 13-year-old who has already amassed more than 30 credits on her IMDB page gives a performance of prodigious cool. Pushing several envelopes (extreme violence extreme profanity extreme smartaleckyness) and juggling teen angst comedy with superhero fantasy Kick-Ass has been adapted from the Mark Millar/John Romita Jr. comic book in nimble fashion by British director Matthew Vaughn. Its the story of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) a dweeby New York City high schooler who decides to become a superhero - even though he hasnt been bitten by a radioactive spider or sent here from Krypton or even put in much time at the gym. Later in the film this fact results in an astute voice-over observation from our would-be hero ""With no power comes no responsibility."" But Dave who has a pair of comic book-obsessed nerd buddies and an unrequited crush on a classmate (the pert Lyndsy Fonseca) customizes a wet suit and goes out on the crime-ridden streets anyway. Armed with a couple of batons and ""the perfect combination of optimism and naivete"" Dave dubs himself Kick-Ass. And after he gets those words reversed on him in front of a doughnut shop crowd videos of his valiant effort to save a guy from a mugging become a viral sensation. A YouTube phenom is born. As fate (and Jane Goldman and Vaughns canny screenplay) would have it Kick-Ass unites with Hit Girl and Big Daddy to do battle against gangland boss Frank DAmico (a mobbed-up Mark Strong the villain in Sherlock Holmes). Meanwhile DAmicos sheltered sourpuss son Chris (Superbads McLovin Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has dreams of being a caped dude too. Enter Red Mist looking like a Kiss tribute band reject. Kick-Ass has punk energy ace action moves and a winning sense of absurdist fun. The film wittily references Billy Wilders Sunset Boulevard Frank Millers Sin City and Ennio Morricones spaghetti western scores (among many other films TV shows music and comics). If its depiction of high school life feels cliched - lunchroom pecking orders Internet porn masturbation jokes - those cliches have everything to do with why Dave puts on a mask and a green-and-yellow costume and busts out of there. Does the spectacle of a preteen in pigtails slinging ninja stars and nasty epithets feel exploitive or inappropriate or appear to be a sign that the end of civilization is upon us? Well in Vaughns hands - and Moretzs ridiculously assured turn - the question is moot. Sure Hit Girls wild and woolly behavior shocks and startles but thats the idea. She pulls it off with impudence and impunity - and so does the movie. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Kick-Ass wants to shock your momma.The new superhero action-parody -- half a scrappy sendup of the ""Spider-Man genre half a desperate wannabe -- indulges in all sorts of bad behavior designed to appall the guardians of culture while delighting the young the jaded and the smug. Fusing teen comedy bad-boy raunch Tarantino-style gonzo mayhem and tossing in a bloodthirsty little girl vigilante who swears like Steve Buscemi in a Coen brothers movie the film has its moments of high-flying low-down style. Its also nowhere near as subversive as it thinks it is. But dont tell that to the fanboys; the more hot and bothered you get the happier theyll be.At the core of ""Kick-Ass is a terrific idea the same one that enlivened the comic book on which the movies based. (That comic written by Mark Millar and drawn by second-generation Marvel talent John Romita Jr. is as cheerfully upfront about its antisocial tendencies as the film with the second issue promising ""Sickening Violence Just the Way You Like It Unlike the movie the comic holds on to its tricky semi-satiric tone without losing its cool.) The idea is simple What would happen if a real high-school doofus sent away for a costume and tried to become a masked avenger?Short answer Hed end up in the hospital. Surprisingly this doesnt stop Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson). The new metal plates in his head and limbs have him crowing ""I look just like Wolverine so whats a little permanent nerve damage? Actually in his green and yellow wetsuit Dave -- a.k.a. Kick-Ass -- looks more like an ambulatory cucumber.During his second attempt to be a hero -- an ugly exceptionally funny brawl in a quick-stop parking lot -- Dave has the good fortune to be caught on cellphone cam by a bystander and soon hes the most-watched clip on the Internet. This makes sense As any 16-year-old will tell you it hasnt really happened until the video goes viral. (What doesnt make sense is that Kick-Ass reaches out to his followers via a MySpace page. How very 2007.)As long as ""Kick-Ass is playing with the gap between its heros fantasies and woeful reality the movie is rude witty entertainment. Keeping his superhero identity under wraps Dave allows himself to be adopted as a gay BFF by his dreamgirl Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) thus neatly taking the passive-aggressive crown from Peter Parker and Clark Kent. Director Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake) one of the nihilistic lads in the Guy Ritchie school of filmmaking keeps the tone rough but bright with comic-book intertitles and fast farcical bursts of violence that are meant to bruise.Eventually though the wit gets choked off by the rest of the movie which daubs a veneer of shock comedy on top of the same old comic book yada yada. ""Kick-Ass baits sobersided grown-ups with the appearance of a few more masked superheroes Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) a former cop with a grudge to settle against the towns major gangster Frank DAmico (Mark Strong doing a lazy ""Sopranos riff) and Daddys little darling Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) a middle-schooler with a taste for nunchucks butterfly knives and the ""C word. That last bit was highlighted in the top-secret ""Red Band trailer for ""Kick-Ass that your kids were probably streaming on their laptops last January making this R-rated movie the must-theater-hop title of 2010. Eh. An 11-year-old girl swearing is not the end of the world just one more jokey coarsening in the fabric of life in our 24/7 googolplex. Im more concerned that Moretz cant keep up with Cage whos a past master of serious wack. This time out the actor has swiped Adam Wests diction from the old ""Batman TV series as Big Daddy grudgingly accepts Kick-Ass into his and Hit-Girls gruesome revenge plot. For all the flying masonry and stuntwork Cage remains this movies most special special effect.Moretz is game but shes still playing dress-up and the sneakier parts of the character elude her. Is there an extra Fanning sister stuck at home with nothing to do? Maybe she could have taken this role into truly transgressive realms while convincing us of the characters humanity -- the power charge Hit-Girl gets from wasting bad guys and the price she pays in losing her childhood. Moretz will be seen next as the girl vampire in the remake of the Swedish horror film ""Let the Right One In and itll be interesting to see just what she can do if and when a film slows down and lets her.""Kick-Ass has no such intent. Vaughn and company keep cranking up the old ultra-violence and weaponry -- the film eventually breaks out a bazooka with a joy that can only be called orgasmic -- and at some point it becomes exactly the big boneheaded movie it was making fun of in the first place. By then Dave Lizewski has been lost in his own story trumped by the gangsters nerdy son Chris who himself suits up as Red Mist a sort of devolved Robin figure.That this character is played -- with great good humor -- by Christopher Mintz-Plasse the found-object dork of ""Superbad tips the movies hand. ""Kick-Ass breaks a few taboos but leaves the central power fantasy at the genres center untouched. Why mess with the engine that drives our adolescent entertainment culture especially when millions can be made by pretending to mock it? With ""Kick-Ass you get to have your layer-cake and eat it too and as long as you dont dare think about it everybody wins.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet How come no one has ever seriously put on a superhero costume and taken to the streets to do good? And what would happen if they did? Like the Mark Millar-scripted/John Romita Jr.-drawn comic-book series that inspired it Kick-Ass opens with these questions and lands on the same answer for both Theyre likely to get hurt. Aaron Johnson plays a comic-book-fixated high-school kid who decides to give it a go anyway putting on some modified scuba gear adopting the name ""Kick-Ass"" and heading out on patrol where he promptly earns a beating that sends him to the hospital. He gets better buys another costume then sets out again pulled by the same drive that keeps comic-book heroes going obsession. That clever idea gets away from director Matthew Vaughn the former Guy Ritchie associate behind Layer Cake and Stardust. While nobody could call the world of Millar and Romitas book realistic it at least seems like a life-and-death place where conflicts lead to real consequences. By contrast the films back-lot Toronto version of New York feels no less stylized than the worlds found in other superhero movies. Vaughn opts for comic-book bigness--big fights big laugh lines big explosions--but without a Spider-Man or Batman at the front of the action Kick-Asss heroes and villains look smaller-than-life in a larger-than-life world. It doesnt help that Johnsons performance never turns the emotions of his schlub-turned-avenger hero into ballast against the wildness around him. Few of the Taxi Driver-like undertones of Millars comic book remain in place but the film keeps some of his dark wit and fans of Nicolas Cage scenery-chewing will appreciate his turn as Big Daddy a masked avenger whos Adam West with a mean streak when wearing his costume and Ward Cleaver with a subscription to Soldier Of Fortune when out of it. Chloe Moretz is similarly memorable and disturbingly entertaining as Hit-Girl Cages foulmouthed sweet-faced bloodthirsty daughter and sidekick. Kick-Ass comes closest to inspired unsettling lunacy when it lets Moretz loose on a bunch of bad guys who arent expecting death to arrive wearing pigtails. But elsewhere Vaughn struggles to put his own stamp on some familiar action beats unless spotlighting a billboard featuring his wife Claudia Schiffer counts as a personal touch. A film about wannabes who use attitude and bluster to emulate their inspirations this ersatz blockbuster ends up seeming a little too much like its heroes.

amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Kick-Ass amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Exit Through the Gift Shop Birdemic Shock and Terror >> Kick-Ass Superhero Step One The costume. Thats easily accomplished in a montage. But then theres Step Two Fight crime. And thats when things get nasty. Matthew Vaughns bloody-bonkers action-comedy gets props for admitting that its teen geek hero Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson) cant live up to his name. On his first mission hes stabbed. Once stitched-up he never enters the fray with confidence. But three other local fighters do mobster boss Frank DAmico (Mark Strong) with his squad of goons and father-daughter tag team Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and elementary school-drop-out Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) both dedicated to bringing DAmico down. Vaughn and Jane Goldmans script based on the comic by Mark Millar doesnt shy from recognizing the gun-mad girl has been brainwashed by her dad but boy does it love watching her slice the heads off some suckas. Its a star-making role for Moretz (who Scorsese just snatched up for his latest) but everyone--even Christopher Mintz-Plasse as double-crossing wannabe Red Mist--holds their own even in the face of their biggest enemy lax pacing that makes this fun film drag and lurch. This isnt the best flick it could be--for one Id love to shave 30 seconds off of every scene-but its anchored in its own eye-popping bullet-blasting world thats grounded enough in reality to feel fresh and sadistic. Its biggest credibility stretch? When Kick-Ass legend takes off he self-promotes . . . on MySpace.

Comments (2) Kick-Ass Recommended Rated R  117 minutes  2010 Adapted from a Marvel Comics series this offbeat superhero adventure gets a lot of satirical mileage from subverting the Spider-Man fantasy of a high school loser who discovers a mighty alter ego. When the young protagonist (Aaron Johnson) dons a green wet suit and ventures into the streets of New York City as the righteous Kick-Ass hes promptly stabbed in the stomach and hit by a car. The Clark Kent/Peter Parker cliche of the hero striking out with women in his daily life gets a bitter twist as well when the kid returns to school learns that his injuries have won him the reputation of being a gay cruiser and is adopted as a politically correct platonic pal by the girl he adores (Lyndsy Fonseca). Less interesting but already more remarked upon are the movies calculated transgressions which include a foul-mouthed 11-year-old crime fighter (Chloe Moretz) and plenty of graphic violence. This is the ultimate fanboy product pitched at children rated for adults and destined for epic DVD sales. Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake Stardust) directed; with Nicolas Cage. By J.R.

"Kick-Ass reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Kick-Ass reviewed. Kick-Ass reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 15 2010 106 PM The Dubious Charms of Kick-Ass Was it a good idea to cross Tarantino with a Y.A. novel? By Dana Stevens Kick-Ass Kick-Ass (Lionsgate) the new superhero fantasy based on a series of comic books by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. comes with its own built-in buzz-generating controversy Are we scandalized by the fact that the movie features a preteen girl (Chloe Grace Moretz who was 11 at the time of filming) blowing away bad guys and cursing as if she were a made man in Goodfellas? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In a much-discussed line that appears in the films red-band trailer Moretzs character the purple-wigged tartan-skirted Hit Girl bursts into a room full of evildoers and announces her presence with ""All right you cunts lets see what you can do now."" Later she describes a Batman-style signal that the mayor flashes in the sky to summon superheroic aid ""Its in the shape of a giant cock."" The shock value of these lines made the trailer a huge hit at this years Comic-Con and at the screening I attended a significant portion of the audience (but not a majority) held their sides in mirth every time Hit Girl dispensed another nugget of age-inappropriate wisdom. In a profile of Moretz in the Sunday New York Times the director Matthew Vaughn pointed out the hypocrisy of those who criticized his movies use of profanity while ignoring its violence ""I was like Does it not bother you that she killed about 53 people in this film? ... Im like Would you rather your daughter swore or became a masked vigilante killer? Theyre going Yeah I dont know. "" Advertisement Cogently put sir. But this critic for one is going ""Yeah it does bother me that Moretzs character Hit Girl and her fellow amateur superheroes rack up a body count in the high dozens."" In the course of this zanyromp made for the high-school set human bodies are microwaved crushed in trash compactors skewered bazookaed and burned alive. And yes its comic-book violence and deliberately over the top--but since Kick-Ass whole premise is that comic-book violence when enacted in real life has real consequences it seems a strange choice to layer Tarantino-style splatter onto the Y.A.-novel setting and play the whole thing for laughs. Though Hit Girl has become the focus of the marketing campaign shes not the movies main character. That would be Kick-Ass the alter ego of a scrawny teenager named Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson). After wondering with his geek pals about why no one tries to be a superhero in real life Dave decides to order a green-and-yellow wet suit and mask over the Internet and strike out as a freelance crime fighter. Kick-Ass soon becomes a YouTube sensation for his masochistic willingness to intervene in street scuffles but he discovers he isnt the only amateur superhero on the streets of New York City. A former cop Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage) has transformed himself into a costumed vigilante called Big Daddy to take revenge on the mob boss (Mark Strong) who framed him years ago for a crime he didnt commit. Macreadys preteen daughter Mindy aka Hit Girl shares her fathers passion for guns knives and vigilante mayhem. And in a late-emerging subplot the mob boss son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) uses his fathers inexhaustible wealth to construct a super-persona of his own. Sentences I never thought Id write Nicholas Cage gives the most nuanced performance in this movie. Cage now firmly entrenched in his late-mannerist phase turns a neat vocal trick whenever he dons his Big Daddy mask and cape His speech rhythms lurch into the odd staccato delivery of Adam West TVs original Batman. As Damon McReady talking to his daughter Cage sounds completely different his voice a soothing paternal wheedle. Cages studied campy performance doesnt really fit the movies tossed-off casual tone but you have to admire the amount of thought he put into details that so few younger viewers will notice. A man who names his son Kal-El is a man who takes his comics seriously. Its probably not fair to say that Chloe Grace Moretz has struck me as a calculating performer in the two movies Ive seen her in (this and (500) Days of Summer) because both roles as written have been calculated displays of raunchy precocity. Her Mindy/Hit Girl is a projection of presexual juvenile fantasy. Nor is Dave/Kick-Ass blandness the fault of Aaron Johnson the young British actor who plays him (and who will soon be seen as John Lennon in Nowhere Boy). Its the fault of the script which never provides a reason for Daves transformation into Kick-Ass beyond his vague adolescent notion that being a superhero sounds neat. That may be enough to justify Daves embarking on the experiment but it doesnt explain why he continues to venture out in costume after being beaten stabbed and hit by a car. Late in the movie in voice-over Dave puts a glum twist on a line from Spider-Man ""With no power comes no responsibility."" If this film proposed any alternate moral vision that line might count a sly reappropriation of the original. As the prelude to a climactic orgy of bloodletting set to the punk anthem ""Bad Reputation"" the joke comes off as nihilistic and flip. What do these characters consider worthy of killing and dying for? That a protagonist lacks superpowers is no reason for him to lack motivation conviction or purpose. Thats right I just mentioned moral vision in a review of a comic-book movie. Go ahead and call me a sententious schoolmarm (you cunts). The bone Im picking here goes beyond the flaws of a minor movie like Kick-Ass Im ready to rip out the needle on the intravenous feed of comic-book superheroes that Hollywood has had us hooked up to for decades now. Some films derived from comics are excellent; some are goofy good fun; some are lousy. But why has this genre taken our popular culture hostage and what can we do to escape? Wont some filmmaker out there put on her wet suit and come to the rescue? Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

Jones The Bleader Film April 15 2010 Movies | Movie Review Tweet Pin It Reprints Share Good or Famous? Kick-Ass a timely tale about civic-mindedness in the era of reality TV and viral video. By Jonathan Joe Kick-Ass KICK-ASS Directed by Matthew Vaughn ""I really want to be famous"" reads the headline for a recent post to the message board for CosmoGirl.com. ""i just dont know how."" The writer a 14-year-old girl identifying herself as ""imdiffernt"" explains ""i really want to be an actress. i dont know how to though. its my dream to be famous i actually think i have a chance. i know this sounds crazy but i need this. i need this to feel complete. because i dont want to go through life like this. i want to feel like a somebody. i want to take acting classes for two years before auditioning for anything. i dont want to seem like a joke i want to be very good. how should i dress? what should my look be?"" As a curriculum vitae for acting work her post doesnt reveal much stunted logic sense of entitlement lack of self-awareness yearning for a received identity. But she should be able to sell her life story to Hollywood immediately. Having watched numerous childrens movies with my eight-year-old son Ive noticed that their stories often center on the pursuit of fame inexplicably presented as a virtue unto itself. In such kid pics as Alvin and the Chipmunks The Spy Next Door Diary of a Wimpy Kid and the TV movie High School Musical fame is elemental waiting to be liberated like fossil fuel in the cave of our collective consciousness by some enterprising young go-getter. Mirroring the all-or-nothing gamesmanship of Survivor Project Runway and countless other reality shows these movies present the social milieu as a funny life-positive cockfight. This odious permutation of social Darwinism invariably celebrates the savviest gamer whose every relationship and calculation are effortlessly holistically directed toward a big payoff on a big stage with an audience applause and approval. The desire for renown is at least as old as Homers Iliad in which the hero Achilles weighs the pros and cons of exchanging his life on the field of battle for kleos aphthiton (roughly ""fame everlasting""). But this Homeric ideal of individual glory was subsumed by Athenian democracy in which citizen-soldiers known as hoplites were not just entitled but obligated to participate actively in voting and warfare. In The History of the Peloponnesian War Thucydides describes the ambition for collective glory and influence that was central to the ancient Greek city-state. Bloody and imperialist as the city-state may have been its ideal of communitarian participation with the tantalizing promise of shared fame has influenced notions of democratic citizenship ever since. As a boy I learned about Paul Revere and today my son learns about Rosa Parks but the lesson is the same they may be famous now but at the time they acted for the common good with little regard for their own comfort or safety. In the new millennium though its a different story. As globalism marches onward blending or eradicating economies and cultures a new model of citizenship has emerged designed to encourage consumption and reach across every market culture on the planet. Outside the classroom Paul Revere and Rosa Parks are no match for bottle-bronzed death machines like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian famous just for being famous and inspiring nothing more than a need for the spotlight. In the age of YouTube and American Idol when social aspiration and civil discourse take the shape of TV talent contests and viral video celebrity is the de facto expression of citizenship. Talent contests are a particularly instructive example of this model with common folk submitting themselves to the judgment of celebrity panels. Were invited to anticipate the contestants fame while vicariously enjoying the role of celebrity judge and jury who will be awarded a future audience and who will be cast back into anonymity? The working stiff has the opportunity to feel a sensation of agency rare in our fading meritocracy without actually lifting a finger. In a world of ballot-rigging and billion-dollar bailouts where entertainment products are globally synergistic and capitalism is synonymous with democracy (were supposed to be ""voting"" with our dollars) why wouldnt our escapist entertainment celebrate the power grab? All this makes Matthew Vaughns superhero adventure Kick-Ass a particularly timely story about civic-mindedness and the pursuit of fame. Along with a lot of potty-mouthed ass-kicking action the film features a collection of urban white kids engaged in their own version of public service. Adapted from an ultraviolent comic book series by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. it revolves around Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) a high school student who introduces himself in voice-over by enumerating his product preferences ""I liked Scrubs Stereophonics the Goo Goo Dolls and Entourage. Snow Patrol Heroes and the movies of Ryan Reynolds."" His motivation for becoming a vigilante is muddled. On the one hand he sees it as an altruistic flavor of celebrity rhetorically asking his friends ""Why do people want to be Paris Hilton and nobody wants to be Spider-Man?"" On the other he privately reflects that ""It didnt take a trauma to make you wear a mask . . . just the perfect combination of loneliness and despair."" Maybe its both. He reinvents himself as Kick-Ass a costumed crime fighter and becomes an instant celebrity after his exploits are videotaped and posted on YouTube. Dave sets up a social networking page for his alter ego and soon hes friending thousands of admirers and processing requests for help. Hoping to upgrade his sexual status from chronic masturbator to bona-fide ex-virgin he responds to one such message from Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) his high school crush which leads him into a bloodbath involving a bunch of drug dealers. Luckily for him hes bailed out by two other vigilantes 11-year-old Mindy Macready (Chloe Moretz) aka Hit Girl and her cracked father Damon (Nicolas Cage) aka Big Daddy. When Dave gets a load of their hero act--a combination of homicidal combat and psychotic joie de vivre--he decides to hang it up. Aside from feeling outclassed hes lost the stomach for it; of all the costumed characters hes the one guy with a sense of responsibility and empathy.

"Kick-Ass review Whats a spanking compared with taking a bullet? - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 1 1/2 starsKick-Ass review Whats a spanking compared with taking a bullet?11-year-old heroines potty mouth is the least offensive partApril 15 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic (Chris Pizzello Associated Press)In a new introduction to the eight-part comic book series ""Kick-Ass"" which was created in tandem with the film version Image Comics co-founder Rob Liefeld describes the chief strength of Mark Millars superhero lark as extolling ""hyper-real super-violence"" ""so far over the top it has to be seen to be believed ... it makes you cringe and wince and ultimately leaves you with your slack-jawed mouth scraping the bottom of the floor."""");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt; A tasty image especially if you imagine the floor of your local multiplex. Deftly illustrated by John Romita Jr. Millars ""Kick-Ass"" revels in geek revenge with the novelty of teen and preteen vigilantes. High-schooler Dave Lizewski who transforms himself into the self-appointed butt-thumper of the title discovers theres a masked 10-year-old girl out on the mean streets already going by the handle ""Hit Girl."" She is the protege of her ex-cop father also a crime-fighter behind a mask operating as ""Big Daddy."" The task for director Matthew Vaughn was a tricky one. How to ""honor"" the insane gore of the print product without going too far? And how to finesse the violence directed at or perpetrated by the preteen (11 in the movie because 11 is so much less offensive than 10) portrayed by Chloe Grace Moretz? Vaughns answers to those questions hew closely to the comic book. But there is an experiential difference between hyper-real super-violence on the page and on the screen. I started hating this movie around the midpoint. And while Hit Girls single usage of a c-word more commonly heard in Britain than in America has generated some controversy the more pressing issue is how stupidly relentless the gore is from beginning to end. As Vaughn himself told one interviewer ""When my daughter gets to 11 Id far rather she had a mouth like a sewer than be a psychotic mass murderer."" Yes well if you had to choose one thatd be the one. We live in a world where people offended to their very core by the acidic humor of ""Greenberg"" wont think twice about letting their 12-year-olds lap up ""Kick-Ass"" right after they get done rewatching "" Watchmen."" Millars storyline adapted by Jane Goldman and director Vaughn proceeds as if it were selling the most original concept imaginable. What if superheroes actually existed in the real world? Fine but that was the general idea behind everything from ""The Incredibles"" to ""Hancock"" to the bit in ""The Dark Knight"" where Batman has to put up with copycat-idiots invading his turf. Nicolas Cage who plays Big Daddy nearly saves ""Kick-Ass"" in a key early scene in which he teaches his daughter how to take a bullet (shes wearing a vest but it still hurts). That scene is just about right and just about nothing else is in ""Kick-Ass"" from Aaron Johnsons colorless interpretation of Dave to the sight of an 11-year-old getting punched and kicked and then getting bloodthirsty revenge over and over and over. It may well be a hit but me Im waiting for "" Iron Man 2."" 1 1/2 stars MPAA rating R (for strong brutal violence throughout pervasive language sexual content nudity and some drug use -- some involving children)Cast Aaron Johnson (Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass); Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Chris DAmico/Red Mist); Nicolas Cage (Damon/Big Daddy); Chloe Grace Moretz (Mindy/Hit Girl); Mark Strong (Frank DAmico); Clark Duke (Marty); Lyndsy Fonseca (Katie)Credits Directed by Matthew Vaughn; written by Jane Goldman and Vaughn based on the comic book by Mark Millar and John S.

"Kick-Ass | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kick-ass ) Kick-Ass (United States/United Kingdom 2010) April 13 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli We have entered the world of post-modern superheroes where the concept of someone with special powers doing battle against the forces of evil seems quaint almost boring. Batman is The Dark Knight. Superman is on hiatus because the most interesting thing about him is the John Williams theme. And Spider-Man is in the process of being rebooted because no one could figure out where to take the character. Yet despite the trials and tribulations of some of the best-known comic book heroes the genre is insanely popular and that popularity gives rise to projects like Kick-Ass which mock and embrace the conventions with equal zeal. Kick-Ass is part hard-core action flick part parody and part comedy. Done poorly this sort of thing can be painful. Done well as is the case here its a blast. It offers a ""have your cake and eat it too"" experience - you can enjoy the exploits of a superhero while at the same time showing your hipness by laughing at some of the sillier clichA(c)s. There are so many self-referential layers in this material that its almost dizzying to contemplate them all. Kick-Ass transpires in neither the Marvel Universe nor the D.C. Universe but in a world very much like our own where superheroes are found only in comic books. The films protagonist Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is a self-admitted ""ordinary guy"" - not a geek a gamer a stoner or Mr. Popularity. Hes gangly and a little awkward but lacks the hard-core nerd DNA that afflicts many teen male protagonists. His only superpower is ""an ability to be invisible to girls."" He travels in a small pack that includes two comic-loving buddies Marty (Clark Duke) and Todd (Evan Peters). Like many high school males he has a crush on an unattainable girl - the pretty and popular Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) but Dave is realistic enough to recognize that shes out of his league and when she smiles in his direction its probably because one of her friends is standing behind him. One day it occurs to Dave how easy it would be to become a superhero- someone like Batman who doesnt have any innate special abilities. The thought eats away at Dave until he takes the plunge and buys a costume. Then after weeks of ""training"" hes ready to go into action as his rather cheesy-looking alter-ego Kick-Ass. His first foray into crime fighting doesnt go well he gets stabbed and is subsequently hit by a moving car. Recovery is a long tedious process and the accident leaves him with nerve damage. But that doesnt stop Kick-Ass from making a return appearance and on this occasion kids are there with camera phones. The video of him being beaten up while nevertheless driving off the bad guys hits the Internet and goes viral. Suddenly Kick-Ass is a national sensation. And more than that hes an inspiration. A gun-loving father-and-daughter team Damon and Mindy Macready (Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz) buy their own costumes and become Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. Shes a small nimble firecracker with purple hair and hes a virtual Batman clone (complete with Adam West voice). Unlike Kick-Ass theyre armed not with clubs but with guns and theyre not afraid to use them. And while hes just a kid playing at the vigilante game they take this very seriously. Theyre unflinching in their methods and their goal is to eliminate bad guys by any means possible. The commercials for Kick-Ass make it seem almost family-friendly which it most certainly is not. This film isnt just violent it revels in bloody mayhem. There are no taboos. Hit-Girl whos about 11 years old is shown casually blowing away bad guys and later she becomes the victim of a vicious beating. So much for not putting little girls in danger or showing them doing unseemly things. Of course in Hit-Girls case this is an opportunity for some father/daughter bonding. (Or should that be bondage?) On one occasion when she tricks Big Daddy into thinking she wants a cuddly puppy for her birthday he is crestfallen. She then reveals that what she really wants is a cool knife; he is suitably relieved. As a superhero Kick-Ass is an unmitigated failure and thats what gives the film its edge. His popularity is not the result of things he does but of an image that replicates itself millions of times on computers and television sets. Hes the ultimate paper tiger. Dave enjoys the notoriety but also feels pangs of jealousy with all the attention his alter-ego gets. Because he cant take ownership he wallows in anonymity which isnt necessarily where he wants to be. And although his motivations for becoming a superhero are genuine it doesnt hurt that it provides him with a chance to get close to Katie - even if she lets her guard down around him because she thinks hes gay. Kick-Ass is sometimes very funny but not in the cutesy way it is portrayed in the trailers and TV commercials. Those have sanitized this movie to a PG or PG-13 level when its really a hard R. The superhero genre has given birth to a fair number of wannabe satires; with the exception of the animated The Incredibles none has ascended as high as Kick-Ass which bypasses most of the pitfalls that have tripped up many others. (My Super Ex-Girlfriend and Hancock come to mind neither of which was awful but both of which could have been better.) The biggest name in a cast of character actors and relative unknowns is Nicolas Cage who mostly stays out of the spotlight in a supporting role. Its an interesting choice for Cage who was once tabbed as the next (post-Christopher Reeve) Superman before that incarnation of the hero went into turnaround. Here hes playing a Batman-type but his penchant for bloodshed makes The Dark Knight look like a pussy. Cage is clearly having fun with the role even going so far as to imitate Adam Wests voice. The other heroes are Aaron Johnson a British TV actor getting his first major big-screen exposure as the title character; Christopher Mintz-Plasse who will forever be known as McLovin as the devious Red Mist; and Chloe Moretz who will probably get the most attention because of her age. Johnsons job is challenging - he has to convince us that an ordinary guy can kind-of sort-of stumble into the superhero role without a Greatest American Hero suit - and he pulls it off. Mintz-Plasse plays Red Mist as a bit of a weirdo which fits his carefully sculpted post-Superbad personality. And Moretz is tremendous as the perfect psycho Daddys Girl. The only other notable performer in the film is Mark Strong who is playing his second consecutive bad guy (he was a villain in Sherlock Holmes). Taking a look at Strongs list of upcoming films its safe to say that hes on his way to becoming very recognizable very soon. The intelligence and irreverence of Kick-Ass recalls similar qualities in director Matthew Vaughns debut Layer Cake. And although this movie is not wall-to-wall jokes nearly every instance of humor works which is a rarity even for the most adeptly crafted comedies. More importantly care is taken by the writers (Vaughn and Jane Goldman adapting from Mark Millars comic book series) and actors to flesh out the characters into the kind of living breathing human beings viewers care about and root for. The underdog factor is in play - we get behind Kick-Ass because hes standing in for us. The best superhero movie since The Dark Knight (and far less serious in tone or approach) Kick-Ass earns its name in every way.

Cast Aaron Johnson Chloe Moretz Nicolas Cage. Rating R for brutal violence throughout pervasive language sexual content nudity and some drug use - some involving children. RELATED Chloe Moretz Strong language strong girl Superheroes are ready to kick . . . Nics (mostly) bad flicks Superheroes we love Movies based on comic books For more than 30 years its served as maybe the most appropriate superhero-movie motto. Until now that is with ""Kick-Ass"" director Matthew Vaughns hilariously profane ultra-violent take on the not-quite-so-super heroes from Mark Millars comics ""I cant fly. But I can kick your ass."" Thats about the size of it as sad sack Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) tries to realize his dream of being a masked crime fighter. While not all of the elements fit together tonally on the surface level - the level that the title suggests - ""Kick-Ass"" does exactly what its supposed to as long as youre game for the language and the gutting. Dave is your typical comic-book nerd yet he doesnt let his lack of physical strength or speed or anything else one typically looks for in a hero stop him from buying a wet suit and trying to stop a crime as Kick-Ass. This goes poorly as in land-in-the-hospital poorly. But Daves injuries do serve to help him in his crime-fighting pursuits which he quickly resumes. His limited success - basically getting beaten up but taking it well then having cellphone footage of the fight uploaded to YouTube - causes him to wildly overstep his bounds landing him in so far over his head that his death appears certain. Enter Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) as comfortable with a wide variety of weapons as she is dropping profanities like a junior-size longshoreman. And she is deadly. Not just comic-book-style deadly either. The violence in ""Kick-Ass"" is brutal and the language would make Quentin Tarantino blush. (Moretz in particular lets loose with a word you dont hear many 13-year-old girls utter.) And yet in context it makes sense. Mindy Macready Hit-Girls alter ego is being raised by her father Damon (Nicolas Cage) a former cop who ran afoul of mob boss Frank DAmico (Mark Strong) which ruined his life and career and left him a single parent. Now Damon is obsessively devoted to revenge and has indoctrinated Mindy into his plan. She has no childhood; she gets as excited at the thought of a new automatic weapon as most girls do at the notion of a new kitten. Its a twisted look at a fascinating subject the length to which parents will go to impose their own values and desires upon their children - and with those beliefs the attendant problems. (See also parents at Little League baseball games.) And yet its an odd fit with the comic-book sensibilities in the rest of ""Kick-Ass"" as well as the funny bits between Dave and his friends including the suddenly ubiquitous Clark Duke. The overall tone is in fact somewhat hit and miss. How seriously do we take the violence so outlandish that it comes back around to the absurd? Theres no question whom were rooting for here; thats not an issue. Or is it? Damon dresses as Big Daddy enough of a Batman knockoff you wonder how the film escaped a lawsuit. He leads Hit-Girl into incredibly dangerous situations - situations that he has trained her for with excruciating effort (especially for her). She loves it - its a way for her to bond with her father after all. But adults recognize how wrong and how misguided that bonding is. We want Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl to succeed certainly but at what cost? On the other hand ""Kick-Ass"" lives up to its name. The action is insanely entertaining and the comedy at times hilarious. Dave befriends Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) the mobsters son. Only not really - actually Kick-Ass befriends Red Mist the superhero identity Chris has established as part of a larger scheme. Thus their friendship is based on if not a lie then something less than the truth. The same goes for Daves relationship with his would-be girlfriend Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca); she spends a fair amount of the movie in the mistaken belief that Dave is gay - a belief fostered by Dave himself. And yet in any superhero movie questions of identity are always going to be an integral part of the story. Perhaps this is overthinking the movie and what its trying to do. While there are some interesting psychological and social things going on here - note that Kick-Ass is nobody until hes immortalized on YouTube - its also perfectly content to be an insanely violent funny take on an established genre. And in that respect ""Kick-Ass"" lives up to its name. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook; facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

When kids who read comic books imagine that they can leap tall buildings spider-surf the air or lay waste to bad guys with iron-chested daring simply by dreaming of doing those things they already share something with the pop vigilantes on the page. Theyve become the equivalent of a superheros alter ego the Bruce Wayne/Clark Kent ""ordinary guy"" side -- the side that covets and lives vicariously that has to wear a costume and an attitude to fulfill his ""real"" self. So when Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) the 17-year-old hero of Kick-Ass decides to put on a green jumpsuit with yellow piping and become a phantom crime-fighter even though he has no special abilities or physical flair we can see that he hasnt taken leave of his senses. Dave a brainy and bushy-haired geek who looks like Harry Potter crossed with the young Steven Spielberg knows all too well that hes got nothing going for him but will and desire -- nothing but the drive to be a superhero. Its as if he thought that the sheer power of suggestion could fool the bad guys and himself along with them. Kick-Ass directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) is an enjoyably supercharged and ultraviolent teen-rebel comic-book fantasy that might be described -- in spirit at least -- as reality-based. When Dave in costume gets out into the world of grungy criminals he discovers that putting a stop to evil is no picnic. A showdown with parking-lot thieves puts him in the hospital and the fact that he bleeds real blood is part of what hooks you; the movie never makes it too easy for him. But it doesnt mock him either. Standing there in his silly/noble outfit brandishing a pair of ninja batons he looks just crazy enough to be a little scary and when he chases off a pack of muggers and the exploit gets caught on video it becomes a Web sensation. The legend of Kick-Ass is born. Adapting the comic book by Mark Millar and John S. Romita Jr. Vaughn gets a lot of mileage out of the classic superhero tropes by converting them to Internet-age satire ? a media firestorm over the mystery of Kick-Ass identity; Daves one-way flirtation with the gorgeous Katie (Lyndsy Fonseca) who thinks hes her gay BFF. As for the other characters they fill in a vibrant pop patchwork of kamikaze comic-book wish fullfilment. As Chris a mobsters son who tries to uncover Kick-Ass identity by becoming a superhero himself -- the sports-car-driving Red Mist -- Christopher Mintz-Plasse proves great at playing the comedy of aggression off against his spindly mouth-breathing boyishness. And just when it looks as if Daves awkward valor is going to get him killed along comes an even unlikelier masked do-gooder Hit Girl a pint-size purple-haired martial-arts demon whos like a prepubescent version of Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill films. Hit Girls real name is Mindy Macready (Chloe Grace Moretz) and unlike Dave and Chris shes a stylized figure out of an action-thriller dream. The film becomes a dialogue between the two poles the normal-guy teens who long to be invincible and the little girl who more or less is. Hit Girl trained by a daddy (Nicolas Cage) with rubber-suited-vigilante ambitions of his own turns out to be the most ass-kicking character in the film. The reason thats a good joke is that the way she turns villains into cannon fodder is really no more preposterous than say Bruce Willis doing the same thing. Yet is it a problem that Kick-Ass is by far the most violent movie ever to feature kids as heroes? Parents should consider themselves warned though personally I just wish that the film had ended up a bit less of an over-the-top action ride. It didnt need this much slam-bang when it had us at real-life superheroics.

Tired of being mugged by high school thugs in a Manhattan thats notably scummier than the real thing our hero Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson a hot young thing given a perm-and-glasses nerd-over) wonders in a hilariously put-on and intermittent Brits New Yawk accent ""How come nobaddys eva tried to become a suppahero?""In a New York that is part past part near-future and part Canadian soundstage (street crime and graffiti are at pre-Giuliani levels but gadgetry and weaponry are cutting-edge) Dave soon learns the hard way that trying to intimidate thieves while wearing a ridiculous green wetsuit/superhero getup elicits first laughter and then a beatdown. But as soon as hes back on his feet--this time with damaged nerve endings and steel bone reinforcements thus minimizing his ability to feel pain--hes back on the streets looking to fight more crime. His bumbling attempt to battle a four-man crew attracts a cell-phone cam-wielding crowd--which in turn scares off the bad guys. ""Who are you??"" asks an amateur videographer. Ready for his close-up Dave sneers ""Im Kick-Ass"" With that phrase and Daves heroic antics catapulted into the memespace Kick-Ass is real.Vaughn approaches the teenage brain as not necessarily a function of age--adults and prepubescent girls are here equally afflicted with an identifiably adolescent lack of impulse control and concern for consequence. As Daves double life takes shape were introduced to Mindy Macready (Chloe Moretz) a pigtailed blonde pre-teen whose daddy Damon (Nicolas Cage) a wild-eyed ex-cop-turned-ex-con trains her to take a bullet and twirl knives for the inevitable day when ""some junkie asshole pulls a Glock."" The happy family sees the viral Kick-Ass video on the local news and a lightbulb goes off Theres suddenly a socially acceptable context for their hyper-violent bonding exercises--and for Damons jones for revenge against the mafia don who set him up and sent him to prison. Soon Damon/Big Daddy and Mindy/Hit Girl who unlike Kick-Ass are actually good at ass-kicking are wasting drug dealers behind the scenes while Kick-Ass gets all the media cred. Eventually theyll have to join up to wage full-on caped-crusader-on-gangster war.In a rare twist for a long-in-the-works film that strives to be current the characters reliance on technology isnt contrived. In its first half Kick-Ass offers a fairly astute if light assessment of how new media has given fresh outlets for the age-old instincts of both heroism and hero worship. In an accurate mirror of teen technocratic priorities Dave seems to be in the crime-fighting game less to save lives and more for the MySpace glory which leads to newfound confidence which gets him laid--and at that point hes ready to give up the hero racket for good. But no hero (and certainly no would-be franchise-kickstarter) gets off that easy and thus Kick-Ass launches into its second hour a mess of random source cues and progressively brutal action set pieces shot through with shaky moralism (when a child murders grown-ups Kick-Ass wants us to cheer but when an adult man pummels a little girl Kick-Ass wants us appalled). As narrative and thematic clarity falls by the wayside Kick-Ass devolves into a show reel for its own ancillary characters; expect to see a lot of slutty Hit Girls toting mock bazookas this Halloween.For all of its self-conscious edge Kick-Ass feels as if Vaughn took all of his potentially powerful material and filtered it through distancing devices. Its a teen-angst movie filtered through the comic book form (literally in the case of a number of framing techniques designed to situate Hit Girl and Big Daddy in the story) in which the characters themselves only respond to reality as filtered through comic books TV and social networking. Most offensively it takes the strain of Asian pop culture centered on uniformed (and often panty-flashing) schoolgirls coolly and competently kicking the asses of grown men which has already been filtered into American pop culture by Quentin Tarantino and reduces it to shallow shock lines. Are we really supposed to get excited about a little girl saying words like ""cock"" and ""douche""? Anything passed through this many filters would come out weak. Never as shocking as it thinks it is as funny as it should be or as engaged in cultural critique as it could be Kick-Ass is half-assed.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Banksy Tags Himself Exit Through the Gift Shop was going to be a documentary about a graffiti artist. Then he and the director swapped jobs. By David Edelstein Published Apr 11 2010 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Paranoid Pictures) The acidly funny documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop the directorial debut of the British graffiti artist Banksy (real name unknown) is the happy upshot of an unhappy accident. As he explains on-camera (in silhouette under a hood his voice distorted) Banksy decided to have a go at more than a thousand hours of video shot by an obsessive Frenchman named Thierry Guettaunprecedented footage of guerrilla street artists at their clandestine labors among them Shepard Fairey Invader and Banksy himselfafter Guettas own assemblage turned out like the work of someone with mental problems an unimaginable nightmare. To get the unemployed sad-sack Guetta out of his hair Banksy gave him a metaphorical pat on the head and told him to go back home to Los Angeles and try making his own art. This leads to the documentarys final section in which Guetta having adopted the ridiculous nom de plume Mr. Brainwash attempts to conquer L.A. with an immense exhibition. So the films original director has become its subject and its prize subject its director. Narrated by Rhys Ifans with the dryness of a dessicated toad Exit Through the Gift Shop is both an exhilarating testament to serendipity and an appalling testament to art-world inanity. See AlsoRead a response to questions concerning Guettas identity on David Edelsteins blog the Projectionist. Banksy resists making Guetta an altogether loathsome character. The Frenchmans childhood was shattered by the sudden loss of his motherwhich led to his resolve to document everything which perhaps informed his zest for capturing on video the most impermanent of art forms. He is more a classic fool somewhere between Peter Sellerss Inspector Clouseau and Chance the Gardener. Where Warhol gave us a Campbells Soup can Mr. Brainwash gives us a Campbells Soup spray-can. Elvis Presley holds a Fisher-Price toy gun. The oeuvre is derivative of the derivative. Having endured the subway eyesores of the early eighties I hold a relativist view of street art If its good it justifies the vandalism; if it isnt it warrants imprisonment and/or the forfeiture of a hand. But there is no questioning Banksys art. As shown in Guettas footage his satirical assaults on politics and culture in settings as various as the alleyways of London the barrier wall of the West Bank and a ride at Disneyland are affronts of geniusstinging with a lingering afterburn. As a director hes just as explosively succinct. May he vandalize our screens for decades to come. From the sixties to the eighties mainstream moviegoers were righteously appalled by grindhouse revenge flicks and their attendant splatter leaving us young punks to whoop it up at such haute gutbucket fare as Stuart Gordons Re-Animator and the Japanese Lone Wolf and Cub series (with its samurai hero lopping off limbs while pushing a baby in a cart). Such heady times Now a generation weaned on Quentin Tarantino has made geyserific gore both hip and common (in both senses). And here comes Kick-Ass to clean up at your neighborhood multiplex and lower the killing age. Based on a comic by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. the movie opens a bit like the 1999 comedy Mystery Men with its nerdy protagonist (Aaron Johnson) who dreams of becoming a superhero and celebrity. But when the touchingly inept teen in his green-and-yellow wetsuit gets a knife plunged into his gut (in close-up) reality kicks in with a vengeance. Vengeance kicks in with a vengeance. Beyond its high-hemorrhage quotient and recurrent F- and C-words Kick-Ass brings something more transgressive to the party. The most gleeful (and dexterous) executioner is a pixieish blonde 11-year-old (Chloe Grace Moretz) who calls herself Hit-Girl. Her ex-cop dad (Nicolas Cage) once framed by a mobster has schooled her in the art of lowlife-cleansing. Theres a disconnect when you watch Should a girl this agethe actress herself saybe allowed even to see this thing? Is whats onscreen a form of child abuse? Do we splutter in outrage or relax and dig the Grand Guignol spectacle? In schizoid fashion I both spluttered and enjoyed myself. Moretz has aplomb and when Cage underplays the monomania he reminds you what a droll comic actor he can be. Director-panderer Matthew Vaughn fetishizes the little girl and her virtuosic scissor-knife work the hyperbolic weaponry the can-you-top-this carnage. Theres even a teen-sex angle Johnsons nerd superhero pretends to be gay so he can have nonthreatening sleepovers with a luscious classmate. Kick-Ass is a compendium of all sleazy things and it sings like a siren to our inner Tarantinos. As she proved in her Sarah Palin impersonations Tina Fey has a gift for charting the continuum between vanity and insanity. On the posters for Date Night she stands beside Steve Carell in a gauzy blue party dress spattered with mud her hair splayed outbut with her right hand shes smoothing the ends in a cool sexy way. Thats what she does brilliantly the teensy neurotic (or obsessive-compulsive) gesture thats totally at odds with whats happening in the moment. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Like that story the series by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr on which Kick-Ass is based is a comic about comics presuming a substantial knowledge of the icons and conventions of the superhero genre. Its an index of how successfully that genre has established itself in the Hollywood mainstream over the past decade that such postmodern self-referential fare is now deemed apt fodder for major studio releases. Puzzled that no one has ever tried to put comic-book theory into practice Dave hits the streets in the name of righteousness overcoming early setbacks to achieve hero status with a little help from MySpace and YouTube. He also attracts the attention of father-and-daughter vigilante team Big Daddy and Hit Girl (Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz) and arouses the enmity of crime lord Frank DAmico (Mark Strong) whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) sees a chance to dabble in the hero game himself.Director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake Stardust) directs with efficiency and a good sense of action while Johnson puts in an engaging turn that maintains sympathy and helps paper over some of the plots more jerky episodic aspects. Wearing its sources on its Spandex sleeve Kick-Ass fairly bulges with references to other comic-book movies especially the Spider-Man and Batman franchises; Cages stilted delivery as the Dark Knightish Daddy is a nice touch. Theres some intriguing play around ideas of closetedness - a perennial concern of the genre - with Daves secret life leading classmates to presume hes gay. Other conventions are touched upon but left unexplored while it is constructed around three father-child pairings for instance the film leaves Daves single dad a cipher. The bond between pre-teen Hit Girl and her Big Daddy meanwhile is as intense as it is outrageously violent rooted in such affectionate larks as his shooting her at close range to familiarise her with the use of bullet-proof vests. The duo are responsible for many of the pictures numerous fatalities shown in more detail and with more gusto than in most superhero films (or most 15-rated films for that matter). The sight of Hit Girl slicing and dicing half a dozen thugs to the accompaniment of the Banana Splits theme tune locates Kick-Ass in the post-Tarantino landscape of hyperfictional ultraviolence. Any gestures at a version of realism or the pathos that might result from someone actually trying to be a superhero are lost in the wash.

""Kick-Ass"" most certainly does. Equal parts audacious dark comedy wish-fulfillment fantasy and over-the-top tongue-in-cheek action-adventure Matthew Vaughns bloody funny adaptation of a cult-fave comicbook series manages to be sufficiently faithful to its source material to please fervent fanboys while remaining easily accessible for ticketbuyers unfamiliar with the superhero storytelling conventions Vaughn (""Layer Cake"") and co-scripter Jane Goldman satirize as well as celebrate. Scenes of hilariously overstated violence perpetrated by an 11-year-old girl doubtless will discomfort many and incense quite a few. But this deservedly R-rated Lionsgate release should nonetheless score a knockout in theatrical and homevid venues. The title is both an alias and an attitude adopted by Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) an all-too-ordinary Manhattan high schooler whos neither especially nerdish despite his immersion in comicbook culture nor confidently cool. Hes so eager to transcend his anonymity -- and not incidentally impress a pretty classmate (Lyndsy Fonseca) -- that he clads himself in a DIY superhero costume (a green-and-yellow scuba outfit ordered online) and sets out to prove you dont need otherworldly origins to fight crime and do derring-do. Unfortunately Daves first attempt at superheroics as Kick-Ass end with -- well with his getting his ass kicked. But even a forced trip to the hospital is not enough to dissuade him. While Dave takes his tentative first steps toward heroism bespectacled eccentric Damon Macready (Nicolas Cage) and spunky young daughter Mindy (Chloe Grace Moretz) make bold strides forward in their preparations for purpose-driven lives as relentless vigilantes. Dad is encouraging but implacably demanding as he teaches his little girl how to survive point-blank gunfire and wield lethal weaponry. Fortunately shes a quick learner and Damon is so pleased with her progress that he buys her all the ice cream she wants -- and helpfully shoots the sole survivor of her first armed assault on felons. The latter gesture comes as a kicker to a jaw-dropping mind-frying sequence in which Mindy -- decked out in cape mask and purple wig as the aptly named Hit Girl -- violently dispatches a dozen or so bad guys to the tune of the ""Banana Splits"" theme. (Her father whose own disguise closely resembles Batmans assumes the identity of Big Daddy.) Hit Girls dramatic arrival is perfectly timed Before she shows up Dave/Kick-Ass once again is outmatched by unfazed foes. To be sure the would-be hero scores enough relatively minor triumphs to become an instant celebrity -- enough to attract millions of hits for the YouTube video of his skirmish with street thugs. But Kick-Ass simply isnt in the same league as Hit Girl and Big Daddy. (For one thing hed prefer not to actually kill anybody.) Hes not even as ruthless as another masked marvel Red Mist whos really Daves classmate Chris DAmico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Chris also is the son of a slick sadistic crime lord (Mark Strong) whos trying to smoke out the heroes who are decimating his henchmen. Here and there ""Kick-Ass"" offers some genuinely clever observations about the creation of celebrity in a world where viral video clips and latenight talkshow quips can turn attention seekers into overnight sensations (and inadvertent role models). Pic also takes a few potshots at not-so-innocent bystanders who refuse to get actively involved in anyone elses emergencies. For the most part however ""Kick-Ass"" is less concerned with social commentary than slam-bang outrageousness. Hit Girls increasingly escalating mayhem is a running joke that somehow gets funnier as the pic progresses and Moretzs deft mix of girlish sincerity and steely ferocity only increases the laugh quotient. Of course that wont be enough to keep some professional moralists from taking issue with her onscreen activity. As Dave Johnson (a young Brit soon to be seen by U.S. auds as John Lennon in ""Nowhere Boy"") makes a reasonably credible and thoroughly ingratiating transition from enthusiastic klutz to self-empowered hero while Mintz-Plasse amusingly plays Chris as a kind of darker more dangerous variation of the McLovin character he memorably essayed in ""Superbad."" Mark Strong recently a seriously menacing villain in ""Sherlock Holmes"" brings the right touch of wink-wink overplaying to this pics antagonist. And Cage earns some big laughs as he channels the smiley spirit of several 50s TV sitcom dads while teaching his daughter how best to kill miscreants. Fans of Mark Millar and John S. Romita Jr.s original comicbook series -- the sort of savvy aficionados who will catch all the inside jokes about Steve Ditko the Spirit and other graphic-novel icons -- might complain about certain liberties taken by Vaughns adaptation. (The motivation for Cages character is substantially different here and pic allows Dave more romantic success than the comicbook ever did.) According to the press notes however scripters Vaughn and Goldman began and completed their scenario before the comicbooks ever wrapped up their ongoing storyline. Production values are fine though perhaps not up to the standard one would expect of a more serious and straightforward comicbook pic.
