Why ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel""? Be cause as with ""The Godfather Part II"" so much character was left to be explored. Because as with ""The Empire Strikes Back"" a journey seemingly completed had really only just begun. But mainly because everything is funny at 10 MHz. ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel"" was the occasion of only the second-highest-pitched squeaking I have heard in a movie theater this year (the top prize still goes to the audience at ""New Moon"") and its far from the most unpleasant kiddie flick Ive sat through this year although I would be misleading you if I promised you lots of laughs. This time Alvin and Co. begin the movie as major rock stars. Alvin the frontman hogs the spotlight while brainy Simon and cheerful tubby Theodore supply his backup. Ive never seen such a ridiculously egomaniacal creature singing ""You Really Got Me"" before except for David Lee Roth. With much crying of ""Alviiiin"" the munks minder Dave (voiced by Jason Lee) gets himself injured and excused from most of the rest of the picture. He hands off to the dull actor Zachary Levi (star of an obscure NBC series called ""Chuck"") with orders to straighten the munks out by enrolling them in school. ""You have to be there by 8"" they learn. ""In the morning?"" says Alvin. Meanwhile the sleazy impresario (David Cross) who used to manage A and the Cs tries to get back on top in the musical-rodent-act-management business by finding a rival group. As he schemes a package arrives in the mail Its the Chipettes a trio of lady chipmunks that immediately gets its Destinys Child on. While Alvins band tries to save its school by winning the big prize at a concert the Chipettes threaten to . . . also save the school. The Chipettes like the Chipmunks are voiced by celebrities (if that is you consider Justin Long a celebrity. Other actors include Anna Faris Jesse McCartney and Amy Poehler) which marks a step forward in actor-worship madness. If you cant see Anna Faris and you also cant hear her (thanks to the squeakalizer or the heliumnator or the fast-forward button deployed on her voice) what exactly is she adding? Its more of an endorsement deal than a performance. The few laughs there are in the movie come from Cross who essentially does his own well-honed delicate-weirdo act without talking down much to either his 6-inch-high costars or the audience. His feverish vows of revenge (""I will. Get you. Chipmunks."") and incompetent scheming give the picture its sole source of forward momentum amid many timeouts for tumbles down stairs wedgies and Alvin scoring the big touchdown for the high school football team. ""You are Theodorable"" is about the level of the wit. Still among cutesy pop musical trios aimed at nondiscerning audiences Ill take Alvin and Co. over the Jonas Brothers any day. As one character puts it ""Fun? I guess maybe its fun-ish.""

Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel Bad Director Betty Thomas. Cast Zachary Levi Justin Long Jesse McCartney. Rating Rated PG for some mild rude humor. RELATED Zachary Levi takes on the Chipmunks Films with animal stars The reasons given vary but everyone knows its a naked grab for cash - if a team normally wears orange and purple say but decides to wear black for a few games its so it can sell more and different replica jerseys. Theres nothing new really - its the same product in slightly different packaging. More money for the same old thing. This came to mind after seeing ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel"" which as the title implies is somehow both more of and considerably less of the same. Whatever limited charms the first version had - mostly David Cross portrayal of Ian the greedy manager who exploits the furry creatures - have since soured. Jason Lee seems to have realized this; he returns only sporadically as Dave as an accident lands him in the hospital knocking him out of the story for the most part. Oddly a similar fate befalls his aunt who was to keep watch on Alvin and the gang while Dave recuperates. That leaves them in the hands of Toby (Zachary Levi) a slacker-type whose sole interest in life is playing video games. Dave has decided that the chipmunks will attend school but in the care of the constantly distracted Toby trouble is inevitable. There are the usual high-school hi-jinks meaning we get both swirlies and wedgies. Theres also competition. Alvin (voice of Justin Long) Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) appear to be shoo-ins to win a battle-of-the bands competition to raise money for their schools music program but the now-disgraced Ians treachery looms. Hes now representing the Chipettes Eleanor (Amy Poehler) Jeanette (Anna Faris) and Brittany (Christina Applegate). They dont know about the bad blood or of Ians nefarious methods. Naturally he enters them into the competition. Along the way various songs are speeded up and sung by the chipmunks boy and girl versions. Bullies are bested friendships are tested and just about everything you would guess happens happens. Even Cross seems tired this time around. Will there be another installment? The first one made more than 217 million. If this one comes anywhere close to that you know the answer game on. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook GoodyOnFilm.

Like the original big-screen Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) this new one is a slapstick pacifier the kind of movie that features gags like Simon getting three-point-shotted into a wastebasket by an angry jock. Yes griping about intentionally stupid jokes in an intentionally silly sequel seems like a churlish and rather pointless thing to do. Yet when Alvin Simon and Theodore take the stage to perform a number like ""You Really Got Me"" (sounding more like a pip-squeak Van Halen than the Kinks) or when they twirl around on top of a blender and toss off a smokin a cappella version of ""You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"" its funky charming and -- yes -- irresistible. In the age of Glee and American Idol when even little kids groove on the pop of different eras the songs in Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel are natural-born showstoppers. The trouble is there are only three or four of them in the whole movie. My hopes were raised with the appearance of the Chipettes a trio of Bambi-lashed female chipmunks who mail themselves to L.A. in a FedEx packet and sign a contract with Ian Hawk (David Cross) the evil agent-promoter from the first film. But they get to do exactly one song (its a goodie ""Single Ladies""). Mostly were stuck with a lame plastic plot that has Alvin and his boys going to high school plus Zachary Levi (from NBCs Chuck essentially taking over for Jason Lee who makes only a token appearance) doing sub-Adam Sandler routines as the chipmunks caretaker. Will kids eat up this cutely fractious claptrap? Of course they will. Theyll eat up whatever you put in front of them. But that doesnt make The Squeakquel good for them.

Share Tweet Even before it hit theaters the achingly essential follow-up to 2007s surprise blockbuster Alvin amp; The Chipmunks blessed pop culture with an infectiously idiotic subtitle (The Squeakquel) destined to join ""Electric Boogaloo"" and ""The Quickening"" in the pantheon of sequel-based pop-culture punchlines. So perhaps it would be churlish to expect anything more from the movie. Sure enough director Betty Thomas delivers pretty much the bare minimum peppy brightly colored tune-filled nonsense sure to meet the low low standards of its pre-kindergarten core audience. A film that promises to resolve all the nagging questions left at the end of Alvin And The Chipmunks yet invites questions of its own The Squeakquel finds the titular trio enrolling in high school in spite of their lack of an elementary-school education. Brash troublemaker Alvin the bad-boy Donnie Wahlberg of the bunch falls in with the jocks and joins the football team though theres a substantial risk that hell get trampled to death on his very first down. Ah but Alvin has more to worry about than getting crushed underfoot by a linebacker. As a means of destroying his former proteges revenge-mad arch-nemesis David Cross--who at one point roots around in a Dumpster in a vivid visual metaphor for his participation in these films--has become a Svengali for The Chipettes a rival trio of singing chipmunks. Jason Lee just barely reprises his role as the title characters alternately loving and apoplectic guardian. In a performance that can best be described as ""contractually obligated"" he spends nearly the entire film in a hospital bed leaving the boys in the questionable hands of his work-averse videogame-obsessed loser cousin (affable Chuck star Zachary Levi). The Squeakquel regurgitates well-worn high-school-movie cliches though the species of its title characters give the film some weird undertones like when the high-schools jocks fear romantic competition from an 8-inch-tall rodent. Militantly inoffensive and cheerfully bland the film aspires to be nothing more than a passable babysitter and it more or less succeeds. Considering that the original grossed nearly half a billion dollars in worldwide theatrical revenue and DVD sales a second ferociously adequate squeakquel appears inevitable.

Alvinnnnn  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterWed. Dec. 23 2009 Starring Zachary Levi and the voices of Justin Long Matthew Gray Gubler Jesse McCartney Amy Poehler Anna Faris and Christina Applegate. 89 minutes. At major theatres. G Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel may be just another chip off the old franchise block - and what studio wouldnt go there when the 2007 flick made some 217 million? - but at least its one that will keep little moviegoers happy without driving their parents too squirrelly.Directed by former Hill Street Blues star-turned-director Betty Thomas (The Brady Bunch Movie) the trio of CGI singing chipmunks are off to high school in The Squeakquel.Article Continued BelowThe helium-voiced munks are arena-level pop stars these days having switched their 50s varsity duds for hoodies and shades. No more warbling novelty tunes about witch doctors and Hula Hoops. Try ""You Really Got Me.""Their adoptive dad Dave Seville is laid up in a Paris hospital thanks to an accident caused by rambunctious onstage antics from chief troublemaker Alvin (voiced by Justin Long). Make that ""Alvinnnnn""Left in the care of their slacker cousin Toby (Zachary Levi) an ambitionless video gamer who has a talent for saying the wrong thing Alvin and his sibs bookish Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and adorably chubby innocent Theodore (Jesse McCartney) find fitting in at school wont be easy especially when youre eight inches tall and dont wear pants.Wiseacre Alvin knows hell be fine. ""Guys Im on pyjamas"" he reminds them. He scampers in like he owns the joint but predictable bullying follows at the hands of the football jocks. Simon gets an impromptu swimming lesson and Theodore suffers teasing about his chipmunk cheeks - both sets. And then the girls show up. The Chipettes (nobody said this was Best Screenplay material) are a trio of cutie-pie chippies with stardom on their minds. Theyre out to challenge The Chipmunks for top spot at a school singing competition.Voiced by Amy Poehler Anna Faris and Christina Applegate The Chipettes arrive a la Cleopatra in a FedEx package with serious crushes on their Chipmunk heroes. They mirror the boys - sassy smarty and cute n cuddly - and sound remarkably like them too.But theres nothing boyish about The Chipettes when they launch into a booty-swishing version of Beyonces ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" which raises questions about why the males dont saucily flip their tails and pump their striped haunches onstage.From football games to food fights the boys learn some out-of-the-classroom lessons about the importance of family friendships and how Meercat Manor can be a metaphor for life.Lightweight as the vehicle may be these munks are all desperately cute and the CGI is far superior to Alvin and the Chipmunks. You can see every hair on their furry faces. And was there ever a cuter nose twitch than adorable Theodores?While the music may grate like a buzz saw theres no doubt The Squeakquel will provide a happy holiday diversion for kids and yes theres room left for part three - let the chips fall where they may.

Its not entirely Thomass fault What are you going to do with those fat-cheeked helium-voiced singing critters but slap together enough ""awwww"" moments to make the toddlers happy and enough knowing winks to keep parental bums in the seats? Except that these days even the under-10 market has to be carved up sectioned off by gender and genre. Enter the Chipettes a rootin-tootin sassy girl group voiced by Amy Poehler Anna Faris and Christina Applegate to compete with then cozy up to rambunctious Alvin and his pals (same guys as last time). With Jason Lees Dave in the hospital and more or less out of the picture our furry lads run amok at school while under the benignly neglectful care of a shy dweeb (Zachary Levi) with a feeble subplot of his own to trudge through. The rest is a horribly loud partially comprehensible and half-assed action movie strewn with homilies about staying true to your sisters and bros which just about every studio except Pixar lazily serves up below the PG-13 cutoff.

Starring Jason Lee Zachary Levi David Cross Justin Long Director Betty Thomas Running time 128 Release Opened Dec 23 2009  Editorial Review Alvin and the Chipmunks sequel is cute enoughBy Michael OSullivanWednesday December 23 2009Call it a Christmas miracle albeit a minor one ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel"" isnt entirely awful.In fact for its young (or merely immature) target audience -- your average fourth-grader -- this sequel to the 2007 feature about an animated trio of squeaky-voiced singing rodents is a fair sight better than the original.Thats not saying a lot admittedly. The first film held essentially the same appeal as a party balloon filled with helium. Sure it makes people sound funny just like fur-ball protagonists Alvin Theodore and Simon in fact. As in the earlier film theyre voiced by Justin Long Jesse McCartney and Matthew Gray Gubler in a CGI version of the novelty musical act created by Ross Bagdasarian in 1958. But how far can you go with that one joke?Fortunately theres a bit more of an actual story here with the introduction of three female chipmunks voiced by talented comedians Christina Applegate Amy Poehler and Anna Faris (though youd never recognize them from their computer-enhanced adenoidal whines). Known as the Chipettes this distaff singing trio serves as both music-industry rivals to and love interests for the ""boys"" as Alvin and his brothers are known. Reprising his role as evil record executive Ian Hawke David Cross lends the movie a distinctly goofy edginess -- a gift for Mom and Dad presumably. At one point Crosss character takes a full-frontal hit in the groin from an errant toy motorcycle.Such is the level of humor in a movie whose biggest laugh comes from a scene in which one of the chipmunks is trapped under a blanket with his flatulent human caretaker (Zachary Levi). Levis character Toby is a last-minute fill-in for the chipmunks more familiar ward Dave (Jason Lee) whos forced to sit out much of the film in a body cast after a particularly nasty chipmunk-induced accident.Director Betty Thomas (""The Brady Bunch Movie"") manages all of this middlebrow mayhem with a suitably light touch. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" its not. But as talking animal movies go this ""Squeakquel"" just squeaks by.Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel (88 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild crude humor and slapstick violence.

Joe Neumaier Tuesday December 22 2009 555 PM Title Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel There is admittedly a low bar to be met for a sequel called ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel."" Does it have three big-tailed singing nut-storers? Check. Do they have high-pitched voices? Check. Okay so director Betty Thomas ""squeakquel"" is as advertised.However the 6- to 10-year-old audience this movie is aimed at deserved better. The movies plot is a hodgepodge of standard kid-film elements spread around a nest of fame-obsession. The visual jokes about the Chipmunks presence in the human world arent silly enough and neither is the idea of our heroes being beloved as ""rock stars.""Finally though three writers are credited with Thomas (""The Brady Bunch Movie"") followup to the 2007 smash no one can think of anything for the Chipettes -- three girl munks dreaming of the big time -- to do besides bat their brown eyes and sing a little.Still there are a few attempts at heart. After hyper Alvins (Justin Long) onstage high jinks put songwriter ""dad"" Dave (Jason Lee) in the hospital Alvin and the ""boys"" are placed in the care of their dopey cousin Toby (Zachary Levi). He sends them to high school where Alvin is recruited by the football team when he shows he has a furry little throwing arm. He soon learns that it isnt cool to abandon his brothers timid Theodore and bookish Simon.Meanwhile nasty would-be music promoter Ian Hawke (David Cross) finds Brittany Eleanor and Jeanette and promotes them as the Chipettes. When they compete with the Chipmunks at a benefit music contest Simon and Theodore must forgive Alvin if they want to win.It doesnt matter that talented funnywomen Christina Applegate Amy Poehler and Anna Faris are the voices of Brittany Eleanor and Jeanette because the speed-chirp makes them all sound the same. They too make a stand for togetherness when Ian wants to make Brittany a solo star.The movies conceit of making the people act cartoony rather than the CGI chipmunks has a leveling effect and for at least the third time Cross taps his inner child for kiddie-flick villainy. Though the slapstick required of everyone animals or not will exhaust even parents who remember the Chipmunks original hits.Speaking of that the almost-tween crowd may recognize the chipmunks song choices here but they lack spunk. Say what you will about the first movie but it still had ""The Christmas Song"" and ""Witch Doctor"" and a nod to the characters 1950s and 60s roots. Here kids get some toilet jokes and ""We Are Family."" Guess there wasnt much to burrow into after all.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Those furry free-range little stars of screen and song.When the first live-action Alvin and the Chipmunks grossed more than 200 million a couple of years ago it was inevitable we would have a sequel or rather Squeakquel.Isnt that too cute? So is the movie.The computer-generated Alvin Theodore and Simon are going to have to get by on their charm and chittering voices this time because theres not much else to recommend this follow-up.After scaling the heights of pop stardom in the preceding film the guys are marooned here in a dreary domestic setting - living in a modest bungalow with only repeats of Meerkat Manor to amuse themselves.Theyre also enrolled in high school which presents some problems of scale with the chipmunks skittering around on linoleum trying to avoid getting trampled by towering teens.Apparently Jason Lee who played Dave Seville the trios human father figure back in 2007 had better things to do. Because Daves not here man.Not for long anyway. He shows up briefly in about three scenes.Our little rodents (who lately resemble gerbils more than woodland critters) are now chaperoned by Daves klutzy cousin Toby (Zachary Levi). The star of TVs Chuck Levi is weirdly comfortable interacting with his imaginary castmates.Justin Long Jesse McCartney and Matthew Gray Gubler (of TVs Criminal Minds) return as the voices of Alvin Theodore and Simon respectively.Sadly the lead munk Alvin has been neutered in these live-action outings. Instead of being a troublemaking rascal as he was in all prior incarnations hes just a wee bit hyper.This time around romance is in the air. (Or is that the smell of cedar chips?). Meet the singing Chipettes the guys precise counterparts. Theres the frisky Brittany (voice of Christina Applegate) the bespectacled Jeanette (Anna Faris) and the chubby Eleanor (Amy Poehler).The two trios warble well-known pop songs made famous by performers like BeyoncA(c) and Corinne Bailey Rae.The music is consistently appealing as rendered by the chipmunks doctored helium-range voices.That was the crucial discovery made by Alvin creator Ross Bagdasarian back in the 1950s that high wound-up vocals had kick. And its fueled the franchise ever since.Less attractive is the suggestive way these squirrelly siblings are now shaking their booties when you can see it. The nuances of choreography are often lost when the dancers are bite-sized.There isnt much point in discussing The Squeakquels plot. Its as if director Betty Thomas (remember her on Hill Street Blues?) and the other makers of this film simply shuffled a deck of index cards containing story elements and threw them up in the air.The result is a predictable parade of musical numbers (high school singing competitions are popular now right?) a few bodily-function jokes a comic villain (David Cross once more) a touch of sweet munky love and some valuable life lessons to be learned. Sprinkle with specious sentimentality.The whole thing is rather insipid. But Thomas makes it smoother and more palatable than it deserves to be. The Squeakquel should delight the audience of aughts at which it is aimed.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel Comedy. Starring Jason Lee David Cross and the voices of Justin Long and Christina Applegate. Directed by Betty Thomas. (PG. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) First and perhaps most important it should be disclosed that my 4-year-old laughed pretty much nonstop throughout ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel."" This was his ""Citizen Kane."" But despite its success as a babysitter for preschoolers its a not a very good film. As entertainment for mature audiences this movie has four things going for it Its cute at times the song selection is decent David Cross has two or three funny scenes and its only 88 minutes long. The first ""Alvin"" headliner actor Jason Lee didnt seem to have much faith in the movie either. Taking a page from the Anthony Edwards/""Revenge of the Nerds II"" playbook his character Dave begins the movie with a serious injury so his participation is limited to a few phone calls. We hope he was paid at least 500000 for each one.

(AP ... more Photo AP Movie review Alvin and Chipmunks Squeakquel 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Alvin Simon and Theodores surrogate father may be MIA but theres no shortage of story in the latest ""Alvin."" What follows are a few of the major plot points and the superior movie that they were borrowed from. -- With no babysitter available at the last minute Daves jobless slacker cousin takes care of the Chipmunks. (""Uncle Buck."") -- The Chipmunks go to high school where Alvin becomes popular but alienates Theodore and Simon. (""Cant Buy Me Love."") -- The female Chipettes arrive causing a rivalry with the Chipmunks over who gets to sing at a fundraiser to save the schools music program. (""Glee"" ""High School Musical"" ""Breakin 2 Electric Boogaloo."") From there its ""Dreamgirls"" with rodents as the Chipettes align themselves with the Chipmunks sleazy old manager (Cross) and lead singer Brittany is thrust into center stage. Survivors of the first ""Alvin"" wont find it shocking that the movie is fueled by flatulence jokes and slapstick - including a motorcycle that drives into a characters testicles. But its still surprising when movies like this include pop culture references to ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Taxi Driver"" which are more dated than inappropriate. (One more difference between an ""Alvin"" sequel and a Pixar film Pete Docter and Brad Bird will never include a joke about pole dancing.) Your kids may keep laughing through this and the next few ""squeakquels."" But with so many great family movies out this year youll do yourself a favor by checking out ""The Princess and the Frog"" instead. -- AdvisoryChristmas Christmas time is near/Time for crude humor and time for cartoon violence ...

Credit 20th Century Fox In the final scene of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel"" Alvin and his two brothers bed down for the night just a few feet away from three singing female chipmunks. Chipmunks are not exactly known for their restraint which leads us to some depressing math.The Eastern chipmunk can produce two litters a year with up to five young each. Thus within a decade since cartoon chipmunks never die there will be thousands of talking singing chipmunks running around the animation universe far more than the ecosystem can tolerate. They will begin showing up everywhere stampeding through ""The Simpsons"" mucking up Japanese anime driving Clifford the Big Red Dog bonkers. Earplug sales will soar as they sing their electronically manipulated heads off.Anyway the latest adventures of Alvin Simon and Theodore find them pursuing the rock-star careers they began in the 2007 ""Alvin"" film (which like this one mixes live action and computer-generated imagery). Their human handler Dave ends up in traction within the first minutes of the movie which somehow results in the boys being enrolled in school which they inexplicably begin at the high school level. Or something like that.The schools music program is about to be cut so the boys enter a talent contest planning to use the 25000 prize to save the music department. Whichever of the writers credited here thinks 25000 is enough to finance a high school music program needs to go to a few more school budget meetings. In any case a girl chipmunk group the Chipettes is also in the hunt providing the plot such as it is.

"Bright-eyed bushy-tailed - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ChipmunksMOVIE REVIEWS Bright-eyed bushy-tailedIn the fun follow-up to the 2007 film the trio face competition from a girl chipmunk group.December 23 2009|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC Perhaps not since ""The Godfather Part II"" have we seen a sequel come along that more than matches the mastery of the film that came before it -- all the pathos the brio the epic sweep. . . . the cheese balls.Im referring as you no doubt have guessed to ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel"" which builds on the wit the whimsy and the shredding bass that was 2007s ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" the blockbuster hit that would turn the musical Munks into 21st century pop sensations.But if the pop world has taught us anything in recent years its just how tough it is to keep young egos in check when celebrity arrives too early in life. As the film opens Alvin (Justin Long) is out of control while Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) are turning into typical teenagers. Factor in their rock star life -- the screaming fans the limos the paparazzi -- and youve got a lot of very hairy problems.Thats pretty much the tight-wire of tension that veteran comedy director Betty Thomas has to play with as the 8-inch wonders head to high school back in the States while their songwriting guardian Dave (Jason Lee) recuperates in a Paris hospital after an unfortunate mash-up of the more literal sort during one of their concerts.Much of the fun of the film -- no matter your age -- is the way in which everyone acts as if having animated talking/singing rodents scurrying around in the real world is not unusual with Thomas doing a good job of keeping that conceit going. Thankfully talking animals are nothing new for the ""Dr. Dolittle"" director and where some might take this franchise too seriously Thomas brings a light campy touch as she did in 1995s ""The Brady Bunch Movie.""Screenwriter Jon Vitti who was involved in the 2007 Chipmunks vehicle and writing team Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger have added romance to ""The Squeakquel"" in the form of three lovelies -- Brittany (Christina Applegate) Jeanette (Anna Faris) and Eleanor (Amy Poehler). They make up the girl group the Chipettes which sets the stage for a flirtatious competition that anchors the story as fates and fortunes rise and fall.David Cross is back as sinister agent-manager Ian now hoping to resurrect his career on the back of the Chipettes who are just breaking into the biz. Once again Ians main role is to suffer public humiliation at the hands of Alvins wrecking crew which Cross does very well -- or maybe he actually does look better in a gold lame mini than anyone else.Meanwhile with Dave in traction in Paris the main man in Alvin Simon and Theodores life is video-gaming nephew Toby played by Zachary Levi probably best known as nerd-riffic spymaster Chuck in the NBC series of the same name. Hes a good addition to the cast and his chemistry with the Chipsters is touching in a bizarrely heartwarming way.With high school romance and pop music lots of it the filmmakers have a formula that has worked increasingly well particularly with young teens creating any number of entertainment phenoms including ""High School Musical"" and the Jonas Brothers and they milk it perhaps a little too much on occasion.What helps ""The Squeakquel"" when things get artistically rough around the edges is that the tunes are sung by voices that seem to be working off a huge tank of helium always a crowd pleaser as any keg party aficionado can attest.The filmmakers have picked the musical mix well with songs including Katy Perrys ""Hot N Cold"" and the Bee Gees ""Stayin Alive"" no doubt an effort to play to the generational spread they hope will fill those theater seats. And the script includes enough clever moments to help put ""The Squeakquel"" in solid family entertainment territory.The Chipmunks obsession with Animal Planets ""Meerkat Manor"" proves to be one of the best running gags particularly since the Whiskers internecine squabbles so mirror the Munks high school issues. But its the Chipettes cover of Beyonces ""Single Ladies"" you know ""If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it. . . ."" that is not to be missed.

Little kids will love it. Youll need a hazmat suit.""Squeakquel offers the same mixture as before live-action humans computer-animated Tamias striatus and junk Top 40 musical numbers sung in painful dentist-drill close harmony. This time we get six chipmunks instead of three as Simon Theodore and Alvin (respectively voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler Jesse McCartney and Justin Long) are joined by the Chipettes Brittany (Christina Applegate) Eleanor (Amy Poehler) and Jeanette (Anna Faris). Any individuality the actresses bring to their roles is obliterated by the sped-up vocals.Wheres Dave Seville? Luckily for actor Jason Lee the chief chipmunk handler has an Alvin-induced accident in the opening sequence and spends the rest of the movie in a Mexico City hospital bed literally phoning in his performance. His replacement at home is nephew Toby (Zachary Levi of ""Chuck doing his career no favors) a layabout whose job it is to get the munks to high school. Comedian David Cross again plays meanie music exec Ian Hawk with more exposed chest hair than is necessary.If theres anyone having fun here its Wendie Malick as the school principal a closet Chipmunks junkie with the tattoo to prove it. Most of ""Squeakquel though is as formulaic as they come with rote scenes of school hallway mayhem followed by sub-Nickelodeon moral lessons (stick by your family; dont be a jerk) followed by a frenetic race to the big singing contest.The target audience ages 4 through 8 will be very very happy. Older siblings and parents will wish they were elsewhere. Grouchy middle-aged movie critics may or may not be alone in considering this evidence of the near-total bankruptcy of modern pop culture.Actually it would be perfectly acceptable family product (as opposed to a movie) if not for the scripts witless co-opting of Beyonce songs and outdated hip-hop slang. When Alvin opens a cupboard and exclaims ""Holla The cheeseballs are in the hizzouse ""Squeakquel opens up a whole new field of cultural offense digital rodent blackface.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

ABOUT THE MOVIEAlvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel out of fourStars Justin Long Jesse McCartney Matthew Gray Gubler Amy Poehler Christina Applegate Jason Lee Zachary LeviDirector Betty ThomasDistributorFox 2000 PicturesRating PG for some mild rude humorRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Those who cant get enough of the trio of singing bushy-tailed rodents are in for a happy surprise There is more of their warbling kind. But for anyone over age 8 the arrival of Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel may not be the most welcome news. The sequel to 2007s Alvin and the Chipmunks introduces a threesome of sassy female chipmunks. We know theyre sassy and female because they sport ponytails and wear pink and are called the Chipettes. Not only can they sing as tunefully as Alvin Theodore and Simon they match up physically with each of the guys too. Theres even a nerdy bespectacled Chipette. Several comic actors lent their vocal chords for squeak-tweaking in the chipmunk parts. Justin Long Jesse McCartney and Matthew Gray Gubler reprise their roles as Alvin Theodore and Simon while Amy Poehler Christina Applegate and Anna Faris play Chipettes Eleanor Brittany and Jeanette. The Chipmunks ""dad"" Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is not in the picture much this time around. He took a bad fall thanks to the antics of Alvin and is holed up in a hospital in Paris where the singing chipmunks were performing. Everything is telegraphed for the very young or the very dense. The hospital sports a classic Parisian view of the Eiffel Tower. Alvin and his brothers must go home to be looked after by their Aunt Jackie (Kathryn Joosten) during Daves recuperation. But things take an unexpected turn. The singing furballs wind up in the care of distant cousin Toby a video-game-loving twentysomething slacker (Zachary Levi). Accidents -- usually involving tumbling down stairs -- are a common hazard for the humans in the movie as Dave and Aunt Jackie learn. Shortly after Dave takes his bone-breaking tumble his elderly aunt is inadvertently knocked down a long flight of stairs in her wheelchair. Falling gags are unfunny enough but the bathroom humor that follows is no improvement. A ""Dutch Oven"" gag is particularly silly and base. And the evil Ian (David Cross) is punished with an assault to his manhood for putting chipmunks in a cage and threatening to barbecue them -- or is it for his arrogance and bad dancing? The Chipmunks are sent to school for the first time where they are stepped on kicked and bullied but drooled over by the creepy rabid fan of a principal (Wendy Malick). Apparently theyre teenage chipmunks because theyre placed in high school. Who knew? Alvin even makes the football team. But little time seems to have been spent casting the humans and even less in providing essential acting guidance by director Betty Thomas. In fact it seems as if no professional actors were hired in the making of this motion picture.

Squeakquel"" picks up more or less where the 2007 ""Alvin"" left off with most of the original pics actors and vocal talents reprising their parts. Chipmunk siblings Alvin (voiced by Justin Long) Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) continue to be rock-star phenoms under the savvy management and loving guardianship of their adopted human father Dave Seville (Jason Lee). And Alvin ever the rambunctious show-off still grabs the spotlight whenever he can -- even if that means often overshadowing his brothers. Very early in the new pic Alvin inadvertently incapacitates Dave -- a plot development reportedly necessitated by actor Lees scheduling conflicts -- and the Chipmunks are forced to take a career hiatus. It takes a fair amount of contrivance on the part of scripters Jon Vitti Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger but the brothers wind up in the care of Daves younger cousin Toby (Zachary Levi of TVs ""Chuck"") a vidgame-obsessed slacker whos surprisingly diligent about making sure Alvin Simon and Theodore attend high school. Meanwhile disgraced former record exec Ian Hawk (David Cross) -- who was force-fed just desserts in the previous pic after exploiting the Chipmunks -- sees a chance to jumpstart his stalled career when hes sought out by three naive showbiz hopefuls Brittany (Christina Applegate) Eleanor (Amy Poehler) and Jeanette (Anna Faris) chipmunk sisters who can sing and dance just as dazzlingly as Alvin and Co. Under the smooth and spirited direction of Betty Thomas (""The Brady Bunch Movie"" but on the other hand ""I Spy"") one thing leads to another in a manner sufficiently zippy to engage small fry with tiny attention spans. Older viewers should be mildly amused and may enjoy the occasional pop-culture reference -- note the allusions to ""Taxi Driver"" ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and a classic 60s hit by the Kinks -- aimed over the heads of the youngsters. The singing sisters known collectively as the Chipettes are driven by Ian to compete against Alvin and his brothers for the right to represent their school in an extramural talent contest. But on the day of the big sing-off Alvin is too caught up with his own selfish pursuits to fulfill his commitment to Simon and Theodore. Naturally this leads to temporary estrangement dramatic crises -- well as dramatic as youll get in a lightweight kidpic about squeaky-voiced singing chipmunks -- and inevitably the learning of important life lessons. The latter too may please oldsters in the audience. Much like the 2007 pic ""Squeakquel"" presents its f/x wizardry so matter-of-factly its easy to undervalue the level of technical skill and kinetic flair involved in the persuasive interplay of human co-stars and CGI chipmunks. Of course it helps that most of the human stars are directed to give stylized performances that while not quite cartoonish go a long way toward bridging any gaps. Cross once again takes top acting honors with his animated portrayal of the sneaky snarky Ian. But franchise newcomer Wendie Malick steals her own share of scenes with her stylish turn as a high school principal whos surprisingly appreciative of Munk music. Levi tries a tad too hard to convey Tobys lack of social graces but he makes a sympathetic impression overall.

Unfortunately its the films only highlight - if the sight of three annoying furballs murdering You Really Got Me can be considered a highlight.Id like to think the filmmakers had a lengthy deliberation about a storyline but I suspect they simply caught an episode of The X Factor and the recently released Bandslam and thought a premise involving a self-centred Alvin a rival group of female chipmunks (The Chipettes) and a college talent contest would prove a mighty good wheeze. And indeed that might have been the case had the story any semblance of... a story. Instead what were offered is a succession of lifeless scenes punctuated by pratfalls that only a handful of kids in the audience found funny. Next.
