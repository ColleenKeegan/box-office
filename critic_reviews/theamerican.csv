An homage to everything from film noir to Alfred Hitchcock to Philip Marlowe and Mike Hammer the film plays out at such a rapid pace you will need to pay really really close attention to keep track of characters that appear and disappear (Im still not sure who some of them are supposed to be) in the blink of an eye. But thats a minor infraction in this otherwise fascinating whodunit/whatisit thriller thats sure to leave some questions unanswered. And thats not necessarily a bad thing. The story centers on a Buffalo New York private investigator (""the only one in the phone book"") Charlie Paczynski (Greg Stuhr the veteran Broadway actor familiar to Chicago audiences for his role two years ago in Bruce Norris ""The Qualms"" at Steppenwolf Theater) who makes some extra cash blackmailing married men with wandering eyes and a lust for Charlies raven-haired stripper accomplice Kat (Kelsey Siepser). Things go way wrong when Kat is murdered during one of their scams and Charlie is propelled into a mystery involving Niagara Falls energy company millionaires (well-played by Matthew Broderick and Robert Forster) and the never-realized inventions of Nikola Tesla the turn-of-the-century Serbian genius engineer who designed the power plant at Niagara Falls and who in 1942 died a pauper in a room at the New Yorker Hotel (his works are apparently still studied by contemporary scientists and engineers). The story goes that immediately after Teslas death federal agents mysteriously seized all of his belongings. Almost all according ""The American Side."" Charlie (Greg Stuhr) and Nikki (Alicja Bachleda-Curus) are caught up in the intrigue surrounding a mysterious document in ""The American Side."" | Photo by Frank Barrera Charlie trying to find those responsible for Kats murder is soon on the trail of a Tesla document -- plans for some kind of energy-harnessing mechanism capable of creating an army of killing machine-like super-soldiers who could help any rogue nation (or evil energy company magnate) take over the world. The trail leads the chain-smoking liquor-swigging PI to an array of quirky characters (thanks to well quirky cameos by Robert Vaughn Janeane Garofalo Grant Schaud and Harris Yulin) beguiling women (Camilla Belle and Alicja Bachleda-Curus) and harrowing near-death experiences (including a machine-gun-equipped prop plane a la ""North by Northwest""). All of it is such a throwback on so many levels (Charlies car his clothes his incessant use of pay phones) that you just go with it no matter how many confusing twists and turns the conspiracy theory plot takes thanks to co-writers Stuhr and Ricker. That Charlie even goes over the falls in a barrel (in one of the most darkly funny scenes you may ever come across) well lets just say its all in a days work for this gumshoe. The cinematography by Frank Barrera (""The Mindy Project"") is dark and lush the score by David Shire (""The Conversation"" ""All the Presidents Men"") the perfect scene-setter. Does Charlie put all the pieces of the puzzle together? Are the culprits revealed? Does our hero get the girl? I wont tell here. That would be like reading the last page of a murder mystery first.  The Orchard presents a film directed by Jenna Ricker and written by Ricker and Greg Stuhr. No MPAA rating; Running time 104 minutes. Opening Friday at the Wilmette Theatre. Ricker and Stuhr will participate in Qamp;As after the 7 p.m. Friday and 2 p.m. Sunday screenings.

Camilla Belle Matthew Broderick and Greg Stuhr star in ""The American Side"" a confounding tribute to film noir involving conspiracy theories Nikola Tesla and Niagara Falls. Image 2 of 2 Greg Stuhr_as_Charlie Paczynski_Alijca Bachleda_as_Nikki Meeker._ Greg Stuhr_as_Charlie Paczynski_Alijca Bachleda_as_Nikki Meeker._ American Side an homage to film noir 1 / 2 Back to Gallery When the people who made ""The American Side"" brag in promotional material about its ""twisting almost impenetrable plot"" they know what theyre talking about. Its film noir all right. ""Noir"" means black and that pretty much sums up the chances of figuring out for the next 103 minutes whats going on. The picture is an insiders tribute to things like conspiracy theories (complete with schematic drawings of suppressed inventions) and hard-bitten dialogue (""The worst trouble shes got is you Charlie"") and low-flying airplanes that chase after good guys (""North by Northwest""). As long as a filmgoer doesnt mind being as befuddled as he was watching ""The Big Sleep"" (a noir picture so confusing that star Humphrey Bogart had to send a telegram to the writer asking what was going on) it doesnt really matter. ""The American Side"" is a grand and glorious stumble through the dark. A lot of things happen and keep happening and it seems as if the plot is moving forward and thats plenty good enough. ""The American Side"" proves its possible to have a good time while scratching your head. The movie has something to do with inventor Nikola Tesla the electricity pioneer who lived alone in a New York hotel and fed pigeons for kicks. Here he is elevated to godlike status and his secret becomes the McGuffin or the thing in a Hitchcock movie that people keep chasing after. In ""The American Side"" director Jenna Ricker orchestrates the endless McGuffin chases around somewhat enchanting Buffalo and to the American side of nearby Niagara Falls which gets a lot of screen time up close and wet. If you have never been to Niagara Falls before seeing the picture you will not need to go afterward. Greg Stuhr plays a cheap detective who talks tough drives fast wears a bandage with panache and cant figure out who the good guys are either. Along the way he gets help from such unlikely film noir soul mates as Matthew Broderick who perpetually looks 16 and silver-haired Robert Vaughn the original man from U.N.C.L.E. who looks the opposite of 16 but handily swipes the one scene bestowed upon him. If only he could open Channel D and explain things to Mr. Waverly and the audience the way he did half a century ago. There are tunnels long staircases dark alleys with beautiful women in them a cheesy carnival hasty glimpses of scribbled secret inventions impenetrable conspiracies (""Most of his ideas were suppressed; its all politics"") and terrific things for actors to say to each other (""I dont mind getting paid to look for someone Im already looking for."") At the end of the movie which is when things are supposed to make sense they still dont. It doesnt matter. ""The American Side"" is a swell trip on one of those cheesy carnival rides and youll know its time to get off the roller coaster when the credits roll.

Starring Greg Stuhr as a low-rent private-eye who stumbles onto a conspiracy involving long-lost technical designs by famed scientist Nikola Tesla The American Side is a loving homage that should be of particular interest to film buffs who can play spot the references. And oh boy are there references from the jittery musical score by David Shire famed for such 70s era conspiracy thrillers as The Conversation and All the Presidents Men to the small plane bearing down on the hero that recalls North by Northwest to the cast populated by a startling array of familiar faces including such genre stalwarts as Robert Vaughn and Robert Forster. Stuhrs Polish private dick named Charlie Paczynski is the sort of tough-talking throwback who smokes incessantly uses payphones and makes such pronouncements as ""appointments are for assholes."" When a shady character compares him to Philip Marlowe he says ""I always preferred Mike Hammer."" ""Even your idols are second-rate"" is the sneering reply. Read More Natalie Portman Jennifer Connelly Honor Darren Aronofsky at Woodstock Film Festival True to form the screenplay co-written by Ricker and Stuhr is barely coherent in its explication of the convoluted plotline. But it does provide a fair share of hard-boiled frequently amusing dialogue and a plethora of colorful characters including Matthew Broderick and Camilla Belle as siblings with a secret Forster as a shady energy tycoon Janeane Garofalo as a federal agent (or is she?) and Grant Shaud (Murphy Brown) as a cuckolded client. Also making brief appearances are such veteran character actors as Harris Yulin and Joe Grifasi demonstrating that the filmmaker has an impressive Rolodex. Lead actor Stuhr doesnt really have the necessary charismatic presence to fully anchor the proceedings but the evocative locations more than make up for it. Cinematographer Frank Barrera makes excellent use of Buffalos faded grandeur with its run-down industrial structures; magnificent buildings designed by some of Americas most famed architects; and of course Niagara Falls receiving its most extensive screen exposure since 1953s Marilyn Monroe- and Joseph Cotten-starrer Niagara and providing the opportunity for one of the films more harrowing sequences.

The film concerns Charlie Paczynski (Greg Stuhr) a private investigator who becomes entangled in a mysterious suicide government conspiracies and the inventions of Nikola Tesla. Paczynskis car and outfits suggest the 1970s theres a distinct lack of cellphones and as Tesla becomes more central the story takes on a slight element of the uncanny that could have been pushed further. Director Jenna Ricker doesnt rely on special effects and ultra-fast-paced editing instead creating a compelling atmosphere through an unconventional setting The film takes place in Buffalo and the most memorable scenes involve Niagara Falls. From the dramatic sway of the Falls Ricker creates a foreboding environment with a late long shot of Paczynski being chased -- a small figure practically enveloped by deep glinting waters -- standing out as particularly well composed. Film Details The American Side RatingNR Running Time104 min. More Info EXPAND The Tesla material feels somewhat undercooked -- melding the almost sci-fi elements of Teslas legacy with the classic detective narrative is no easy task. The American Side is more successful in creating the shadowy atmosphere in which its somewhat convoluted narrative unfolds. The supporting performances are worth noting Janeane Garofalo plays a brusque government agent (who could have benefited from more screen time) and Robert Forster makes a welcome appearance as a charismatic old-school source of information for Paczynski. While The American Side may not quite achieve the classic thriller tone to which it aspires it does create an enjoyably hard-boiled world.
