Its January at the Cineplex but you didnt think you were getting off easy this month with Taken 3 and Mortdecai right? Heck no Not when were hot off the 2015 Oscar nominations announcement. As of now the clock is ticking to catch up on all the films and performances youve been putting off since Christmas break. (No judgments if you downloaded The Interview and laughed at the Kim Jong-Un buttonhole jokes instead of sitting through A Most Violent Year. Apparently youre not alone.) Start with these five newly released dramas. Oh and you might want to check out Boyhood too. PHOTOS Oscars PDA 1. American Sniper3 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)Oscar nominations Best Picture Best Actor (Bradley Cooper) Best Adapted Screenplay Best Film Editing Best Sound Mixing Best Sound Editing It grips from the very first scene when a sniper sits on a roof in Afghanistan and must decide whether to pull the trigger on a child holding a bomb. His name is Chris Kyle and hes played with brooding intensity by a never-better Bradley Cooper. The true story depicts how the taciturn and beefy Texan who served four tours of duty as a Navy SEAL became the deadliest shooter in American history. All the while he struggles to maintain a staid domestic life with his wife (Sienna Miller) and two kids. Director Clint Eastwood deftly shows the mental and physical toll of heroism in a way that will leave you gutted. PHOTOS Best dressed at the Oscars last year 2. Selma3 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)Oscar nominations Best Picture Best Original Song Films dont get more powerful than this effort from Ava DuVernay. Her civil rights drama closes in on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (a magnificent David Oyelowo whose Best Actor snub mystifies) as he leads a march from Alabamas Selma to the state capital in 1965 to peacefully protest voting inequalities. In a bold and refreshing move the iconic reverend is portrayed as both a dignified hero who can sway a room with an eloquent speech and a philandering husband who takes out the garbage. Needless to say his message has never been more relevant. David Oyelowo in Selma Atsushi Nishijima PHOTOS Oscars 2014 - Best picture nominees 3.

But the socially awkward Alan is crippled by a secret Hes gay and is so desperate to stay closeted that he proposes to a colleague (Keira Knightley). Sadly his sexuality will be his undoing in later years. Get past the biopics old-fashioned narrative and youll find a moving tribute to an extraordinary man. Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game Jack English/Weinstein Company 4. Still Alice3 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)Oscar nomination Best Actress (Julianne Moore) Theres a difference between a great performance and a Great Performance. Julianne Moores turn as a linguistics professor afflicted with early onset Alzheimers easily qualifies as the latter. Shes Alice who just after her 50th birthday gets alarmed when she starts blanking on familiar names and words. (""Its like my brain is falling out from under me"" she haltingly explains to her husband played by Alec Baldwin.) Though her family struggles to accept the diagnosis nobody is more distraught than Alice herself. Inch by inch her condition deteriorates and Moore is able to subtly convey all the panic and frustration with just a look on her face. This poignant film doesnt sugarcoat a thing yet its still beautifully done. Julianne Moore in Still Alice Linda Kallerus Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics PHOTOS Best Oscars beauty looks 5. Into the Woods3 stars (out of 4 stars)Oscar nomination Best Supporting Actress (Meryl Streep) Best Costume Design Best Production Design Anna Kendrick as Cinderella Chris Pine as Prince Charming Emily Blunt as the Bakers Wife and the inimitable Meryl Streep as the wicked witch. What a treat to watch stars take on these classic characters in this lush adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical. These familiar icons (and more) go into the woods to seek their fortunes and become pawns in the witchs spell. Streep as always stands out in a forest-chewing role -- though her onetime Devil Wears Prada underling Blunt (herself a Golden Globe nominee) does some beguiling work as well.

"The Dream Act The Powerful Profound Selma << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com The Dream Act The Powerful Profound Selma Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures Movies January 9 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Movies have become very good at assembling armies. Good software and skilled technicians are often all you need. The ensuing chaos of battle tends to resemble a cartoon of war. Whats human grows indistinguishable from whats not and making a distinction between the two sides seems beside the point. Whether the battle is any fun becomes a more pressing concern than its outcome. In Selma you see the bodies assembled on the Edmund Pettus Bridge and notice that this army is different. You notice hats glasses the fabric of coats faces -- mostly brown many handsome. You notice the strength in their expressions certainly but also the fear -- just on the other side awaits the local law enforcement and you notice that youre noticing its assembly too 60 or so strapping white uniformed men. Some of them are on horseback giving them the grim disproportionate grandeur of cavalry. Their strength differs from that of the people on the bridge. The gas masks theyve just slipped on disguise any fear. The reason you notice these accumulated details is that Ava DuVernay the director of this tense showdown has orchestrated it with the meticulousness Wes Anderson applies to his storybook dioramas and Paul Greengrass does to international frenzy. Her touch feels personal not so much because DuVernay is a black American woman making what is already the most widely seen intensely discussed of her three films but because she has an artistic stake in the clarity of the conflict. DuVernay devotes a good number of shots to the serene arrival of these 525 or so people on that bridge because she intends to shatter the serenity and wants you to be shattered too. The black bodies march silently in an orderly line through town across the street and onto the bridge blood flowing through a moral artery to some heart of justice. On the bridge there are pleas to talk one from John Lewis (Stephan James) of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. Theres no acknowledgment from the other side just an order for the officers to head toward the crowd well before the two minutes the protesters have been given to turn back are up. The police swing their barbed-wire bats and lash their bullwhips. For one longish sequence you see the weapons flashing through the fog of tear gas while the scene is narrated by a New York Times reporter into a phone booth telephone. Over his report you hear the up-tempo wail of gospel music beseeching the Lord to come on and walk with me. The siege is a re-creation of a notorious riot from March of 1965 Bloody Sunday. DuVernay gives it a kind of savage beauty. A cop for instance runs downs a young woman the way a cheetah stalks a gazelle. The film DuVernay has made is full of that kind of touch. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage One of DuVernays creative challenges is in presenting the assault against nonviolent demonstrators in a way thats appalling but doesnt leave the victims of the assault seeming passive. Shes focused on the decisive stretch of months during the civil rights era that culminated in President Lyndon Johnsons announcement of legislation that would lead to the Voting Rights Act. The business on the bridge erupts out of a planned peaceful march from Selma to the Alabama capital in Montgomery -- cities in a state where for black Americans the picayune voter-registration barriers were impenetrable. The 15th Amendment granted blacks the constitutional right to vote1 but some Southern states used discriminatory practices (2 poll taxes literacy tests) that mocked legality. Ostensibly Selma is a film about the leader of the movement Martin Luther King Jr. whom David Oyelowo plays with blazing rectitude. But that sequence on the Pettus Bridge takes place without King who stays behind in Atlanta that day. The rear of Kings perfectly round head and broad shoulders and back dominate the posters. The physical essence of King dominates the film too Its load-bearing. But really the movie is not a story about Martin Luther King per se; its a movie about strategic thinking that features Martin Luther King. I imagine one reason the movies have been unsuccessful in giving him the full biopic treatment has to do with it being impossible. Selmas approach is shrewd. King is a leader -- just not the only one. Its he whos gnawing at Johnsons pant leg to get voting legislation passed and he who prevails upon Lewis and James Forman (Trai Byers) at the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to accept the presence in Selma of Kings Southern Christian Leadership Conference. But the movie is vividly stocked with some of the movements other star tacticians Ralph Abernathy (Colman Domingo) Andrew Young (Andre Holland) Hosea Williams (Wendell Pierce) James Bevel (Common) James Orange (Omar J. Dorsey) and Bayard Rustin (Ruben Santiago-Hudson). When these men show up at the home of Richie Jean Jackson (Niecy Nash) and flirtatiously introduce themselves the swoon for anyone steeped in their accomplishments is like the one comic-book nuts feel seeing Chris Evans play Captain America. These men are captains too. The women who lead have less to do but their presence is striking nonetheless. Diane Nash (Tessa Thompson) and Amelia Boynton (Lorraine Toussaint) whos central to the Selma march and badly bruised on that bridge are on the front lines of the marches and present for most of the strategizing. DuVernay seems to understand that simply putting Toussaint in a chair or at the edge of a pew can bestow rational ballast to a roomful of bickering men. There is the mark of leadership in her handsomeness. Carmen Ejogo plays Coretta Scott King as a woman of gentle fortitude. One minute shes folding shirts the next shes daring to tell Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) to take his black militancy out of Selma. Yes this is a movie so vast yet so thematically prioritized that Malcolm X has a walk-on in which he promises Coretta to perform the role of the diverting threat so that President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) and Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) understand how much worse they could have it. The movie is so big that when King needs his own uplift he phones Mahalia Jackson (Ledisi Young) rousing her from sleep and tells her ""I need to hear Gods voice"" which prompts her to sing while her husband continues to sleep behind her. Selma is stuffed with icons who have had or deserve to have movies of their own if you go in for that sort of filmed biography. I tend not to. The facts get thorny. The engineered uplift insults. The notes become predictable. Its some actors Role of a Lifetime. Selma is part of a wave of movies committed to a moment in history like Lincoln. But its more powerfully committed to a climate around a moment.  For DuVernay working with a script credited to Paul Webb the establishment of that climate requires the collapse of a timeline and the conflation of events sometimes to imply causality and at other times to give the film a historical dreaminess. Selma opens with Martin and Coretta alone together in Oslo as he readies himself to accept the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. ""Its not right"" he keeps saying and you dont know whether he means the prize or his tie. Two scenes later four finely dressed girls are descending the staircase of a church discussing the press of Corettas hair the way you might talk today about the realness of Beyonces. Then the walls explode sending fabric and shoes and rubble and glass sailing across the screen. The bombing of that church occurred the year before in Birmingham. And Im not sure this movie needs it. But its a shocking example of the racist weather in Wallaces Alabama. In the next scene a woman named Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) fills out a voter registration card and is called over to a window at the Selma registrars office. She tells the gentleman shed like to register to vote. He proceeds to ask her to recite the preamble of the United States Constitution (she does) and tell him the number of the states county judges (she does). Name them he says his voiced tinged with evil self-satisfaction because of course she cant. Down crashes his stamp denied. These first three sequences build on one another to establish the urgency to eliminate those arbitrary and other more costly impediments to voting. They also create the mix of pride and anger the urgent sense that the march from Selma to Montgomery has to happen. The film invokes a high-pressure system whose winds are at the door of the Oval Office which Lyndon Johnson has just been reelected to keep. Johnson receives King after Oslo and showers him with praise still bewildered as to why King wont accept the administration jobs he keeps offering. King just needs Johnson to get a Voting Rights Act passed. Johnson says it will have to wait; he wants credit for his other accomplishments like the passing of the Civil Rights Act and the ongoing war on poverty. This version of the president knows he cant rest on his laurels. But he also doesnt know what to do about the moralizing nuisance he thinks King is. So before he musters the conviction to act accordingly he lets J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker) sic the FBI on the Kings in order to as Hoover says ""weaken the home."" The home-weakening scene speaks to the films sideways ambitions. In their Atlanta living room Coretta is shown listening to a threatening recording of two people making love. ""Its not me"" Martin says. She doesnt disagree. ""I know what you sound like"" she says. But she gets the point. Ejogos performance presents a woman who loves and is proud of her husband but is no longer enamored of him. Shes weary. Hes caught. But the dramatics are kept to a minimum. You sense theyve been here before. By this point theyve been together for almost a dozen years. Now the FBI is there with them. The inclusion of a scene like this compounds the films audacity. Selma isnt out to conventionally flatter or deify. The movie rejects the myth of the great man that Hollywood biographies are fond of peddling the whitewashing that occurs because its assumed that audiences cant reconcile internal complexity. DuVernay is comfortable with a saint who has sinned. She trusts that we can understand that imperfect immoral people can also achieve greatness. Kings private behavior is ultimately separate from his political agenda. But it also contributes a note of humanity. So does a scene in which he sits on a porch and lights a cigarette and another in which he jealously snipes at Coretta for meeting with Malcolm X. Still there is some sense of divinity that adheres to King and it comes at the risk of making him appear lamblike in the eyes of the flock. Seconds after law enforcement stands aside to permit a second gathering to march from the bridge into Montgomery King takes a minute to consider the weather. He turns around and wades into the sea of protesters. The leadership assembles in a church and debates what it means for King to have turned back. Its a gorgeously done scene that might be too much. King is photographed with an enormous light above him and a glowing cross behind him. But when the meetings over hes shown from a new angle headed up the aisle on a carpet whose blood-redness made me gasp. DuVernay has so elevated the stakes that even the decor portends the violent toll. Theres a strategy in that sequence of shots. We watch Selma aware that Kings assassination is looming. So in the movie is he. That shadow is what intensifies the films heaviness the responsibility King feels for the people walking with him. Thats what turns him back on the Edmund Pettus Bridge his heeding of the awareness that the limits of nonviolence are defined by the violent. Nonviolence cant stop mans uglier nature his fear of change or whatever it is that makes him shoot and whip and beat unarmed activists. In fact if nonviolence is effective it will provoke such ugly retaliation. In that moment God seemed to speak to King and say Turn back. That red carpet in the church afterward is so striking because its an acknowledgment of all the deaths for this cause and of the dying left to do. The bloodshed of his followers -- of every race -- is a source of his sadness and guilt. He cant save them from pain. He can only lead them into it into slaughter. But all there is to do about that is keep marching.  Any number of films now playing are proudly based on true stories -- American Sniper Foxcatcher The Imitation Game Unbroken The Theory of Everything -- and each saves its most interesting news for two or three screens of printed text in the final minutes explaining that so-and-so suffered greatly after the movies narrative version of events concludes that he died. You mean we just sat through a whole espionage thriller just to find out that the cold dull protagonist was actually persecuted for and suicidal over a much more interesting fraught and complex gay life that the movie was too tasteful to explore? You mean the guy in Unbroken actually did break? Selma too saves news of Kings murder for the closing credits. But its not a pulled punch. The film assumes we know hell die. It conducts itself in grim premonition. None of these people is permitted to be larger than the moment in this movie -- not even the man framed with the Christ iconography. This makes Oyelowo (its pronounced ""Oh-YELL-oh-woe"") an effective incarnation of King. Hes rescaled for proportionality. DuVernay could have leaned hard on speeches but the film uses only a small handful. Instead its seeing King rigid in a chair or curled on a bed that generates a gravitational pull. A good actor can get at Kings moral force his playfulness and solemnity. But what made him so easy to follow was the richness and butter of his baritone its ascent to the rafters then the heavens. He was the Mahalia Jackson of oration. I got chills when Oyelowos version eulogized the activist Jimmie Lee Jackson (Keith Stanfield) who was shot and died after police laid into a peaceful nighttime protest. But its not the real thing. Oyelowo is English (as are Ejogo Wilkinson and Roth) and there are times in a couple of sermons when he loses his grip on Kings cadences and comes yea close to an African dictator. The problem of reproducing King in a movie is that when he stood at a pulpit or with a microphone he was inimitable. DuVernay knows this. Presumably in part out of respect for Oyelowos work DuVernay makes sure that by the time the film has dipped into stock footage of the actual march the only King we hear is the voice of Oyelowo. Not all of DuVernays choices are sound. Throughout the film for instance a time stamp with an FBI logo pops up along with type that makes its way across the screen detailing what Martin and Coretta are up to. The idea is to remind us that these two were under constant surveillance. But the time stamps regularity and the font in which these transmissions appear cheapen the prevailing seriousness. What theyre meant to add can already be gleaned from the dialogue. But this is an independent director who like J.C. Chandor has shown steroidal growth over three movies. DuVernay has worked to help other filmmakers work -- sleeplessly it seemed. Her previous film Middle of Nowhere was a melodrama about a woman weighing her romantic options while her man does prison time. That movie really believed in its heroines existentialism. But the leap from Nowhere to Selma is major. This is a large film with a lot of parts but DuVernay controls them managing to lend even the exterior shots intimacy. (Bradford Young shot both this movie and Chandors latest.) Some of the films power transcends her control. This is a film about work the work at hand the work it takes to do the work and for an audience in 2015 the question of whether the work worked. DuVernay is never cute or explicit. No one says anything like ""If we work hard enough well have a black president"" There is no doubt that this forward momentum all of this political progress -- integration mobilization the right of blacks to vote without encumbrance enfranchisement -- has mattered. But when in a moment of doubt Abernathy tells King to keep his eye on the prize King worries that he no longer knows what the prize even is. What good is integration when inequality persists? Some of the films success amounts to a sobering reality check pride in the powerful events it portrays dismay at the break in the arc of progress toward justice today. To what has all of this momentum amounted? A black president? Even Barack Obama would hear that and think Come on now. But that was more or less the given explanation for the Supreme Courts cynically optimistic 2013 undermining of the very legislation the film shows the movement fighting for. In striking down the part of the law that pertains to ""preclearance"" which stipulates that a state with a history of discrimination like Alabama has to apply for and receive federal permission to change voting laws the court essentially argued that electing a black man to the White House or African Americans to local positions of power obviates that sort of federal protection against voter discrimination. Youre moved by the onscreen triumph and devastated by the sense that it has hit a wall. Marching meant everything in 1965 -- but it means too many different things in 2015. In the past 50 years the leadership that was so crucial to the passage of civil rights legislation has evaporated in moments of crisis. Protests persist -- but whats missing today are those moments in which the movements leaders gather to guide it. After the Selma police department and its state trooper counterpart made their brutal descent onto the Edmund Pettus Bridge there was a plan for what the marchers would do next -- a plan that worked its way through activist networks the court and the media in constant coordination. A lot has been made in the last half-year about the diffusion of leadership as opposed to its consolidation. What if when it comes to criminal justice and racial discrimination a black president and a black attorney general are only as powerful as the political thinkers and actors on the ground in communities? Black Twitter is one thing. Black leadership is something else. Some of the activism around the BlackLivesMatter movement is at best a free-for-all. It feels closer to the anarchic energy of the Occupy Wall Street movement than it does to civil-rights-era protests. At its worst its a farce -- say black protesters actually interrupting the brunches of white diners to make a point about brunch being some expression of white privilege. In both New York City and Ferguson Missouri its been striking how law enforcement has followed a code spoken a language with its bodies and agreed upon a way to comport itself. The NYPD for instance appears to be in the middle of a major work stoppage in which everyday police work has undergone a demonstrably precipitous decline. Dont have carfare? Hop the turnstile. Want to park illegally close to a fire hydrant? Go right ahead. The department is angry at a mayor it feels doesnt support it. Since the slaying of two police officers last month by a depressed chronic petty criminal the department has laid the blame at City Hall. In hospitals and at funerals one phalanx of officers after another has turned its back on the mayor a white male who has openly expressed concern for the safety of his black son. Theres been some outcry about what other cities whose forces scaled back policing have called ""the blue flu."" Officially the New York police are not on strike in that theyre still being paid with public money. But they have their collective grievance aimed at one man in a way that threatens public order. The departments tactics here under the aegis of a relentless union leader named Patrick Lynch are perversely resonant. Its not the Alabama cops you think of ominously arrayed at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Its the shrewdly organized civil rights protesters. The moral upper hand continues to elude the NYPD but walking out of Selma the optics ring a bell. The movie gets what made the civil rights movement such a seismic success clashing titans -- on the movements front lines in the White House and in the governors mansion. The stakes in Selma feel astronomical and you feel the pressure and force -- the dynamics -- exerted between participants on each side. In Richie Jean Jacksons living room the various leaders debate each other about how best to pressure the White House. John Lewis pressures King; King pressures Johnson; Wallace pressures Johnson who pressures him right back; the New York Times pressures the nation. The nonviolence philosophy is predicated upon a crazy-making calm that pressures an opposing force to violence. DuVernay makes clear the interplay among political and legal systems. She demonstrates the power of Kings organization to walk right up to the line of law and pressure institutions to change it. The faint hope this summer was that a figure with even some of Kings social and political shrewdness would emerge to connect the grassroots to the establishment. Believers in second comings might say Take a number. You would think a film this rich with contemporary resonance would have started a major national conversation about how far racial progress has come in 50 years. Well it has -- by accident. Since even before the films release theres been carping from historians and politicians who have bones to pick with everything from what the film gets wrong about the Jews in the civil rights movement (why arent they here?) to complaints that this version of King isnt more of a genius. Predictably most of the complaints have been about the films portrayal of Johnson. Hes shown here in a bind and that bind has won the condemnation of academics and politicians who believe the film mischaracterizes Johnsons relationship to King. The attackers feel that DuVernay doesnt give Johnson enough credit for wanting to pass the Voting Rights Act when really the film opens itself to doubt because Wilkinsons performance is a mess of dithering. Johnsons bluster is missing -- his bigness. You dont know how this person managed to do the legendary negotiating that got the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1964 passed. But thats not necessarily inaccuracy. Its interpretation the sort that directors and actors always traffic in. On some level the critiques are just rites of a fact-obsessed Oscar-campaign season. But the sniping also gets at the eternal modern question of whose history this is and who gets to tell it. A quick survey of film history suggests that the depiction of racial themes in America has always been the province of white directors whether its something as spectacularly diabolical as D.W. Griffiths The Birth of a Nation or the antebellum revenge of Quentin Tarantinos Django Unchained. These great-man movies tend to reflect the aspirations and identities of the people who make them which is how so many stories ostensibly about black life wind up with white interpolators. DuVernay understands the fraught imbalanced legacy a film like this pulls her into and shes been as fair as she needs to be. This is not a film that undermines or questions Johnsons ultimate contributions to the improvement of black life in this country. (It very easily could have mentioned the two decades in Congress he spent opposing civil rights legislation.) Inasmuch as there are villains they are Wallace Hoover and Selmas sheriff Jim Clark. But because this isnt Johnsons story those accustomed to seeing the president as hero (or protagonist) ultimately seem dismayed by how little of the president there is here. Johnson is ripe for a big movie in the Lincoln style. (In the 1980s Johnson was the primary subject of two TV films and in 2002 HBO gave him a sprawling treatment in Path to War.) Selma isnt it. You can imagine another film about Selma focusing on Michigan activist Viola Liuzzo (Tara Ochs) and Boston minister James Reeb (Jeremy Strong) two white people compelled like many others to come to Selma after seeing the televised melee on the Pettus Bridge. They play small but important parts in DuVernays film; both wound up being murdered by white supremacists for their involvement in the cause. But this movie is about the unified concerted effort required to give black people the vote. And it is also about telling stories about the civil rights movement that more accurately reflect its participants. I imagine if DuVernay had a made a film about slavery thered be less to complain about. Thats not something the carping historians need to argue over since the moral boundaries are clearer. But with Lyndon Johnson shes on gloried turf. What the film wants to show is that ridding racism from the countrys legal framework was hard -- for King for Johnson for those working with either of them and for those working with both. This is an industry and culture used to celebrating white people whove acted on behalf of blacks and the blacks who served them. In dramatizing the fight for a Voting Rights Act you do sense that its a necessary -- and defiant -- cultural rebalancing that has upset people. Johnsons not only the president of the United States here. Hes also the help. Black men that is. The 19th Amendment which prohibited the denial of voting rights based on sex wouldnt come for another 50 years after the 15th. Filed Under Movies selma martin luther king jr.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Vivid nuanced and yes timely director Ava DuVernays civil rights-era drama ""Selma"" opens in 1964. Martin Luther King Jr. stands in front of a mirror frustrated by an ascot wife Coretta helps him with. He is about to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. The award ceremony took place more than a year after the civil rights movements historic March on Washington. More than a year after the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham Ala. The first event has become a signature triumph of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement. The other remains a base instance of terrorism American-style. They are potently pointedly pressed up against each other in ""Selma."" That scene between husband and wife in Sweden captures an intimate moment of a known figure -- two actually. And there will be more fraught tender scenes between Martin and Coretta as the story of the 1965 efforts to enfranchise black voters in Selma Ala. unfolds. One of the many subtle feats of director Ava DuVernays film comes in delivering Martin Luther King Jr. as game-changing leader as doubting human. David Oyelowo brings exquisitely modulated force to his performance. Carmen Ejogo gives a turn both luminous and shaded as Coretta Scott King. Even before we see King we hear his voice. Yet ""Selma"" is not a film full of the powerhouse oratory so many of us know King by. The King estate keeps tight control of the slain civil rights leaders speeches. Whats been crafted here feels true to his spirit if not exactly his words and its and meted out with a finesse that reminds audiences that Kings power wasnt simply rhetorical. Indeed DuVernay exercises a great deal of quiet and admirable discipline in a film that could have been mired by nostalgia. Jason Morans score resists easy swells and makes good use of spirituals. Up-and-coming cinematographer Bradford Young offers a palette that straddles eras -- the early 6os and ours -- with grace. Not all of the action takes place in Selma. King makes a number of visits to President Lyndon B. Johnson. A tremendous Tom Wilkinson plays the oft-exasperated occasionally outplayed president. Writer Paul Webb originally wrote ""Selma"" as a drama about Johnsons efforts to pass the Voting Rights Act before DuVernay shifted the focus to MLK. And in recent days the movie has come under fire for scenes that downplaying LBJs leadership on civil rights -- some argue even villifying the president. King doesnt arrive hat in hand but with an insistence that the president address the security of all of the nations citizens. Indeed King was not in Alabama when the events dubbed ""Bloody Sunday"" took place on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Johnsons meeting with Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth plays the savvy arrogant segregationist) after that outrage is a fine and nasty bit of political theater. ""Selma"" depicts the complex dance between leaders and movements and adds to an understanding of the roiling conflicts within the movement. Tensions existed and persisted. Stephan James makes young activist John Lewis deeply sympathetic as he tries to bridge the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committees aims with those of King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. A meeting with Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) and Coretta speaks to a prevalent anxiety on the part of a number of white politicians including Johnson Deal with King or face more radical activists. Its a fear Malcolm X suggests they use to the movements advantage. The players are all here Diane Nash the Rev. Ralph Abernathy Andrew Young Amelia Boynton Bayard Rustin the Rev. C.T. Vivian. the Rev. Hosea Williams James Bevel. The list goes on. The cast is muscular. The movie begins with a scene worthy of Franz Kafka as Selma citizen Annie Lee Cooper (played by Oprah Winfrey) is rebuffed yet again in her attempts to register to vote. Even so Oyewolos King is the star. ""Selma"" does not blink in the face of violence from unnerving images of chatty girls headed down a church staircase to the beating of minister James Reeb. One of the most touching moments comes when King arrives at Selmas morgue and meets the grandfather of a young man killed by a state trooper after a nighttime protest. As recounts his grandsons life Kings eyes brim. The Sunday March 7 1965 attack by state troopers on hundreds of marchers was viscerally ugly. It was also watched by millions of television viewers. Wed miss an opportunity if we ignored the atmosphere in which ""Selma"" arrives. The litany is vexing and abridged here Ferguson. The aftermath of Eric Garners death and the killings of New York City police officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. Tuesday an incendiary device was detonated outside the Colorado Springs office of the NAACP. Wednesday morning news came from Paris of the killings at the offices of a satirical magazine that has made sport of radical Islam. Terror continues to be the theme we live with be it lone-wolf or far more organized local or global. There is a saying in French ""plus ca change plus cest la meme chose"" -- the more it changes the more its the same thing. It is an elegant quip but also demands caution especially as a rallying point. It invites cynicism. For the lazy ""Selma"" might be used as a ""see nothing really changes"" bludgeon. For the rest of us ""Selma"" should resonate but also challenge. DuVernay has made a film that is less about easy catharsis or reignited fury than it is a drama that speaks of the vision strategic discipline and political wrangling required to maintain and grow democracy.

"Selma (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Selma (PG-13) An urgent and compelling recreation of a momentous chapter in the civil rights movement. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezmiamiherald.com1/8/2015 Editor rating 3.5 Selma a stirring drama based on the 1965 civil rights marches from Selma to the Alabama capital of Montgomery to demand voting rights for African-Americans in a post-segregation South is the first Hollywood movie to put Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. front and center. Perhaps Kings accomplishments were deemed too large and important to cram into a single film or maybe studio executives who place business and profits above all decided such a large project wouldnt justify its cost (Spike Lees epic-length Malcolm X released in 1992 grossed a respectable but not-quite-stellar 48 million). Complicating matters was the fact that Kings three children one of whom has become estranged from the other two sold the rights to Kings life and speeches in 2009 for a film that never got made. Whatever the reason director Ava DuVernay (I Will Follow Middle of Nowhere) and first-time screenwriter Paul Webb have started to correct the situation. Instead of trying to encapsulate Kings entire life they focus on one of his most important achievements the way Steven Spielberg did with Lincoln Pressuring President Lyndon B. Johnson to sponsor a bill striking down voting restrictions. In the process the filmmakers also give us a portrait of the man his drive and his tactics. We first meet King played by David Oyelowo in a mesmerizing commanding performance that accentuates the man and not the icon accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. A few weeks later he would find himself in Selma reeling from the aftermath of a failed attempt at a march later referred to as ""Bloody Sunday."" Policemen armed in riot gear turned away the marchers resulting in countless injuries and the death of a 26-year-old man. Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) who used violence to stop a peaceful march is satisfied with his decision. But the incident only serves to stoke the flames within King who uses his personal access to the president (Tom Wilkinson) to push the matter of voting rights and takes to his pulpit to preach non-violence and persistence to his followers. Although the filmmakers did not have the rights to use any of Kings recorded words they came up with facsimiles that sound like the real thing. Oyelowo nails Kings oratory prowess and his ability to inspire and mobilize. But he also captures Kings political savvy his ability to read people and the manner in which he dealt with those who didnt believe in his tactics (Malcolm X played by Nigel Thatch shows up in one scene in which the two men exchange respectful differences of opinion). Unlike most biopics about heroic men who shaped our history or helped bring about change (such as 2013s Mandela Long Road to Freedom or The Butler) Selma doesnt feel like freeze-dried hagiography. DuVernay is a dramatist first a historian second and she uses supporting characters to draw us into the film as if it were a piece of fiction making it feel alive and vibrant. In one terrific scene Kings wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) confronts him about his infidelities (DuVernay trusts her audience enough not to explain what the argument is about) and through her anger you feel the profound connection and love these two people shared. The scenes inside the White House including one in which a weaselly J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker) offers to sabotage King or telephone conversations between Johnson and a seething Wallace who made no effort to disguise his racism illustrate the formidable enemies King had to navigate. The ongoing controversy over the films depiction of the relationship between Johnson and King as combative is overblown and in the end moot. Its the sort of scrutiny and nitpicking that almost every fact-based film from 12 Years a Slave to Foxcatcher falls under. The movie ultimately depicts Johnson as supportive of King which is what matters most. Instead of a history lesson Selma plays like suspenseful absorbing drama. Even a cameo by Oprah Winfrey (one of the films producers) as a woman who gets turned down when shes trying to register to vote doesnt play like a distracting stunt. The movie ends on a triumphant hopeful note but the victory is bittersweet and the racial tensions that continue to permeate our country from Trayvon Martin to Ferguson prove that Kings battle is still unfinished regardless of who currently occupies the White House. Selma looks to the past to nudge us about the present Like Dr. King did the film captures your mind and your heart as it entertains the way great movies often do.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 09 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 09 2015 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ava DuVernay Written by Paul Webb Starring David Oyelowo Carmen Ejogo and Tom Wilkinson Classification PG Country USA Language English Theres a distinction between an artistically bold film and one that is important because it takes on a weighty subject. Last years big race-relations movie 12 Years a Slave accomplished both Director Steve McQueens focus on gazing on suffering had a universality and power of implication that made it much more than as cynics suggested about how slavery was bad. Video Video Why Selma honours the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. Selma is this years big movie statement on Americas race history and by comparison its conventional an above-par docudrama chronicling the historic voting-rights marches from Selma Ala. to the state capitol in Montgomery that ultimately led to the landmark federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. What takes it out of the movie theatres and into public discourse is its timing and comparisons to the rallies that have swept the United States in recent months in protest against the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers. By unavoidable implication (not to mention the lyrics of John Legend and Common on the soundtrack) its clear the struggle for the vote in 1965 is part of the same long march that leads to the protests of 2015.Selma is about political consciousness-raising which is hard to criticize. Taken strictly as a movie though Selma is an uneven yet generally skillful effort that has probably drawn more praise and criticism than it warrants.We meet Martin Luther King (played by British actor David Oyelowo) on the night he receives the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo fussing with his wife Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) over how to tie an ascot. Moments later we witness the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham Ala. by the Ku Klux Klan an act that killed four girls. The juxtaposition feels heavy-handed (particularly given that the bombing took place more than a year before Kings award) but it sets the tone Intimate backstage moments combined with momentous historic events.But the violence is a foretaste of what is to come. While King may have been a global figure his doubts and sense of vulnerability were warranted. The humane lead performance by Oyelowo - who captures the cadences if not the majesty of Kings oratory (which is used sparingly) - focuses on the quiet turmoil behind the outward confidence and on his sense of destiny. The ""constant closeness of death"" haunts both him and his wife. Kings serial infidelities bluntly if briefly dealt with here add to the strain of the marriage.Mostly though this is a movie about strategy. The march from Selma was intended as a showdown a battle aimed at the television cameras pitting non-violent symbolism of the orderly dignified peaceful black protesters against the rabid white police goons with their guns truncheons and attack dogs. This is where King and other members of his Southern Christian Leadership Conference headed in January 1965 to force legislators hands. Simultaneously we see King lobbying the U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) who is portrayed here perhaps with some dramatic licence as a man forced into doing the right thing.King may be the prime mover but as the movies title suggests Selma is an ensemble story which crams a multitude of characters into its two-hour running time. The many players include Oprah Winfrey as hospice care-worker Annie Lee Cooper who we see in an early scene facing the absurd double standards for black voter registration. A single scene sees a visit from Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) a formerly contemptuous critic of Kings who declared himself an ally shortly before his own assassination. The casting includes an effective Cuba Gooding Jr. as civil-rights lawyer Fred Gray and Martin Sheen as federal district court judge Frank Johnson. A separate subplot concerns the conflict within the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee between James Forman (Trai Byers) who resents Kings high-profile opportunism and the future congressman John Lewis (Stephan James) who sees the bigger picture.Not all these casting choices are on the money Wilkinsons LBJ is tall ostentatiously condescending and wily but something of a caricature. Dylan Baker is an eccentric choice as FBI boss J. Edgar Hoover and Tim Roth downright improbable as Alabama Governor George Wallace. (It would have been better to cast the great Stephen Root who plays a Wallace underling in the role.) Theres a sense that the project made for a modest 20-million (U.S.) was important enough that everyone wanted to be involved and too important to fuss about strict verisimilitude.In those moments when Selma works it flies high. The initial march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma which led to a savage attack by troopers on horse back is terrifically staged. In one short scene veteran character actor Henry G. Sanders as the stricken 82-year-old father of a man killed by Selma police is heartbreaking. And as any preacher knows a rousing ending can cover any number of small flaws. Selma reaches its climax with Kings victory speech from the steps of the state capitol and Oyelowo rises beautifully to the occasion with the promise that ""Our freedom will soon be upon us."" To which the only proper response is a fervent ""Hallelujah."" Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey More Related to this Story Selma Is it civil? Is it right?

As a dramatic portrayal of recent U.S. history however Selma burns with a fierce intensity. That burn can be seen in the eyes of lead actor David Oyelowo. Unintentionally daring Academy Award voters to acknowledge greatness Oyelowo has stripped away the vestiges of his own Nigerian-British heritage. As a result he is utterly mesmerizing in his fearless yet quietly human portrayal of an American hero Martin Luther King Jr. Eyes on the prize In chronicling a few months in the life and times of the now-legendary civil rights activist in 1964-65 director Ava DuVernay does what no other filmmaker has been able to do in the 47 years since King was assassinated for his social politics and for his race. Both as the director and ghost co-writer of Selma she has made a major motion picture with King at its heart and with a Hollywood studio at her back. For mobile users click this link Kudos to her and executives at Paramount Pictures. Amazing that Selma the film is about to open wide across North America just when there is another upwelling of racially charged social unrest in the U.S. Hallelujah that if DuVernay is nominated for an Oscar as best director she will become the first woman of colour to be so honoured. The symbolic value would be enormous. Yet nothing about Selma is outwardly flashy as it takes us behind the scenes of the events leading up to the now-famous Selma to Montgomery protest march in 1965. The issue then was the systematic denial of voting rights to citizens with African heritage. DuVernay takes an exacting methodical and thoughtful approach to the topic recognizing her responsibility and the serious task at hand. Although she was refused a co-writing credit by original screenwriter Paul Webb DuVernay re-wrote Webbs draft to make Selma much less about then U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson and much more about King himself even writing the speeches Oyelowo delivers with such authentic-sounding purpose in the film (this was necessary because the King estate controls the real speeches including ""I have a dream ...""). By focusing so closely on King DuVernay allowed the story of the civil rights movement to stand on its own in a clear light freed from the yoke of looking at the civil rights movement through the prism of white America. Not that the major players from that side are denied their place in history Tom Wilkinson plays Johnson with a gruff gusto while making sense of Johnsons ambivalent yet crucial role in desegregation; Tim Roth is absolutely terrifying as George Wallace the bigoted governor of Alabama during the events depicted here; and Martin Sheen has a singular cameo as federal judge Frank Minis Johnson who was Alabama-born but worldly in his views making several historic rulings that gave civil rights a legal basis. On the other side of the racial divide which continues to haunt America Oprah Winfrey is memorable as voting protestor Annie Lee Cooper Common plays activist James Bevel with conviction Andre Holland is effective as future U.S. ambassador Andrew Young Cuba Gooding Jr. is notable as civil rights lawyer Fred Gray and Carmen Ejogo is riveting as Coretta Scott King. Some of that casting took guts In addition to Oyelowo Ejogo Wilkinson and Roth are all British. But they turned out to be the right actors for the roles they were assigned. There are a lot of right things as well as righteous things about the film Selma. But more than anything it explains America to Americans (and the world) with great care and intelligence.

"Selma the new civil rights drama resonates today review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSelma the new civil rights drama resonates today reviewIn Ava DuVernays Selma Martin Luther King Jr.s struggle for civil rights unfolds as gripping drama rather than a history lesson in a movie that speaks to these anxious days of renewed racial and cultural unrest.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 8 2015SelmaStarring David Oyelowo Tom Wilkinson Carmen Ejogo Tim Roth Dylan Baker and Oprah Winfrey. Directed by Ava DuVernay. At GTA theatres. 128 minutes. PGThe Martin Luther King Jr. we see in Ava DuVernays Selma isnt the legendary figure of commemorative holidays stamps or statues.Hes a man of flesh blood and foibles striving to do what he believes is right while shrewdly calculating the practical and political moves necessary to achieve his aims in the racially divided America of 1965.Article Continued BelowNor is this truth-based drama which deserves major attention this awards season a routine biopic of King the Baptist minister civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner felled by an assassins bullets in 1968. Selma which stars David Oyelowo fourth from left as Martin Luther King Jr. deserves awards attention.Its not a biopic at all actually since it focuses on just a few momentous months in the winter and spring of 1965 when Kings message of non-violent opposition to hatred was seriously put to the test in a southern enclave where racism ruled and lynchings were still common.Writer/director DuVernay was unable to secure the film rights to Kings most famous speeches -- including his ""I Have a Dream"" oration at the 1963 March on Washington D.C. -- so she and main scripter Paul Webb were obliged to create dialogue that captures the mans essence rather than his exact words. This benefits the work rather than limits it. We see history as it unfolds not as it has been encased in amber in a movie that needs to be seen in these anxious days of renewed racial and cultural unrest.Nothing could stop this film just as nothing could stop King who is masterfully rendered by David Oyelowo. The British actor who previously starred in DuVernays 2012 Sundance-honored family drama Middle of Nowhere utterly nails Kings measured voice cadence and gestures. Oyelowo depicts the civil rights fighter as a man aiming for the law books rather than the history texts. Hes not always sure about what steps he should take and with very good reason.The 87 kilometres of highway linking Selma Alabama with the state capitol of Montgomery today a U.S. National Historic Trail was in 1965 a path of hostility obstruction and violence for any black person who challenged white authority. Its the path King and his followers vowed to traverse that spring in a five-day March to peacefully demonstrate for the right of African-Americans to vote a right supposedly guaranteed by law but one trampled by racist police and civic officials. DuVernay depicts the three marches -- there were two early attempts -- in all their significant drama including the infamous ""Bloody Sunday"" police attack against 500 protesters on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7 1965 savagery that was televised globally to a shocked world.DuVernay has been criticized for downplaying the support of then-U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson for the Selma marchers. Played by Tom Wilkinson who gets LBJs shrewd mind and rough manner exactly right Johnson is seen urging King to get on board with his governments War on Poverty agenda and to leave voting rights until later.Is this fair to the legacy of Johnson who was instrumental in enacting civil rights and voting legislation? In my opinion the film correctly depicts LBJ as a calculating politician forever weighing pros and cons as all pols do. He wouldnt have been the first president to say one thing in private and another in public.And Selma isnt about Johnson just as it isnt about FBI boss J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker) or Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) who both did their utmost to discredit and block King.For once this isnt the white version of history but neither is it a whitewash of King and his complications. We see him struggling with fidelity issues with his wife Coretta Scott King played very well by Carmen Ejogo. At times he questions his resolve even as he carefully calibrates how best to use the media to spread his message.King also must deal with opposition within his own ranks including members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who feel they are being shut out of the Selma march planning. Some of Kings supporters wonder how long the movements credo of non-violence can be maintained when peaceable protesters are being greeted with fists truncheons and guns.DuVernay doesnt try to hide any of Kings shortcomings in her portrait of a dedicated but very human leader. And her film isnt perfect either especially in its handling of the women in this drama who include Oprah Winfrey in an affecting cameo as Annie Lee Cooper one of the early pioneers of voting justice for Alabamas black citizens.Its especially unfortunate that we dont see much of Coretta Scott King in the film especially since Ejogos portrayal of her is so strong revealing much behind a veiled comment or raised eyebrow.But its remarkable that Selma was made at all considering the low production budget -- DuVernay worked miracles with 20 million -- and the difficulties of bringing a story like this to the screen in an industry and culture still dominated by whites.Kings message still matters not only to history but also to these anxious times of racial and cultural tensions in Ferguson MO. New York Paris and everywhere that peace and justice are afterthoughts rather than objectives.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Selma | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; selma ) Selma (United States 2014) January 08 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Selma offers a warts-and-all snapshot of half-century old American history events beginning around the first of January 1965 in Selma Alabama and culminating with the triumphant third march to Montgomery and President Johnsons introduction of the Voting Rights Act to a joint session of Congress. The period in between represented one of the darkest periods of the 1960s Civil Rights movement. Not only did it feature the murder of Malcolm X on February 21 (an event only alluded to in the film) but it was highlighted by widespread acts of brutality and a tactical struggle between Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) and Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) about the best way to push forward voting equality. Most movies about the Civil Rights Movement tone down depictions of violence to obtain the MPAAs golden ""PG-13"" rating. There are good reasons for doing this but I have always felt that neutering the brutality does a disservice to viewers who may not be familiar with history. Selma is an exception; it doesnt pull punches. This is a harsh movie but perhaps as a tacit acknowledgment on the part of the MPAA of its historical importance it was accorded a PG-13. Martin Luther King Jr. is the films hero and with only occasional detours Selma presents the events of early 1965 from his perspective. In this role David Oyelowo is mesmerizing. He exudes charisma and his mimicry of Kings oratories resonate with passion (this is especially noteworthy since the filmmakers were forced to use ""alternative versions"" of speeches because another studio holds the copyrights for the actual ones). Selma offers a biographical fragment of Kings life that echoes Steven Spielbergs Lincoln revealing character by focusing on a specific incident. The most compelling moments in Selma are the intimate ones. Especially revealing are Kings bouts of self-doubt that reveal the underlying humanity of this supposed instrument of God. We also see how King and his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) live under the constant threat of death. An assassins bullet would claim Kings life in April 1968 but there was a sense even in 1965 that such an eventuality was inevitable. The film has been criticized for its historically inaccurate depiction of President Johnson; however director Ava DuVernay has no greater responsibility to being rigorously factual than any other non-documentary filmmaker. She massages history to suit her thesis without distorting it beyond recognition. The problem with Johnson to the extent there is a problem is that he is miscast. As good an actor as Tom Wilkinson is this isnt the right role for him. Not only does he fail to resemble Johnson in voice manner or appearance but we never get to the point where we lose sight of the actor. This isnt an issue with Oyelowo who is fully and transparently King from the moment the camera focuses on him. Stylistically there are some minor missteps. Occasional captions purportedly ""reports"" by the FBI are unnecessarily distracting and smack of gimmickry. On the other hand DuVernays recreation of the Jim Crow South is strong and she mutes colors to suggest the way in which the black population is being choked. The verisimilitude with which she reconstructs the three marches allows her to incorporate actual news footage late in the film without its inclusion seeming jarring or inappropriate. What Selma does so well is to bring to life the events of 1965 especially ""Bloody Sunday"" (the first march). Its one thing to read about these moments in a history book but another altogether to see them on the screen. The movie is riveting. It reminds us not only of how far we have come as a society but how far we have yet to go. Selma recollects one of the greatest recent growth pains this country has endured. In the process it tells a story whose arc passes through unimaginable tragedy to reach a point of triumph. The presentation (and subsequent passage) of the Voting Rights Act wasnt an end but it was a step forward - one of many steps begun by Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation and still going on today. Like other accomplished motion pictures Selma encourages reflection and discourse. How many movies can make that claim?

Only the hemlines and tailfins beg to differ.It may be coincidence that Selma reverberates with a particular timeliness as its coming out just as issues of voting rights have hit the media and the black-lives-matter protests have hit the streets.Still its thanks to director DuVernay and first-time features writer Paul Webb that the film has more than the luck of timing on its side. It dramatizes a pivotal moment in contemporary American history with verve heart and dramatic tension getting behind the heated headlines and magnificent oratory to reveal the politicking and maneuvering on all sides.Its 1964 and King (a phenomenal David Oyelowo Lee Daniels The Butler Interstellar) has won the Nobel Peace Prize. But he realizes his biggest challenges are in front of him. Case in point agitating for voting rights in the face of a president Lyndon Baines Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) who is shown as not wanting to anger the South anymore than he already has with the Civil Rights Act. Johnson wants to move forward but with more of a go-slow approach.On the other side is Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) who is dismissive of Kings nonviolent style and thinks its time for confrontation. King is in the middle with followers who sometimes grow restless with the course of change and a wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo The Purge Anarchy) who wants to desperately hold on to him even though she realizes she has lost him to a cause bigger than their marriage.How King juggles all these balls -- while still planning the Selma march which could turn into a deadly confrontation with Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) and his supporters -- is what gives Selma its narrative propulsion.This approach makes Selma feel less like hagiography -- a problem that afflicted Mandela Long Walk to Freedom in 2013 -- and more like intimate biography. It helps that DuVernay didnt try to squeeze an entire life into two hours but merely a slice of it.It should be noted that some have disputed the films take on history. Mark Updegrove the director of the LBJ Library in Austin has gone on record saying that the portrayal of Johnson is inaccurate. ""When racial tension is so high it does no good to suggest that the president of the U.S. himself stood in the way of progress. ... It flies in the face of history"" he said to The Associated Press last month. Johnson comes across as conflicted human and very political. Admittedly it does make for good drama.DuVernay deserves kudos for going with two relative unknowns -- Oyelowo and Ejogo -- in the lead roles. The actors are British but they inhabit their iconically American characters with authenticity.Giovanni Ribisi Common Cuba Gooding Jr. Martin Sheen and Oprah show up in smaller roles. Oprahs appearance is the only one that feels forced as if shes only in it because shes one of the producers. Most of all though DuVernay who only had done two small films previously deserves applause for being able to tackle such a major subject with such a sense of grace and -- for the big Oscar-bait type film that this is -- economy.DuVernay is definitely someone to watch.

Martin Luther Kings groundbreaking 1965 voting-rights march from Selma Ala. across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to the State Capitol in Montgomery. January 8 2015 -- 232pm Video (0225)  This is the story of a movement. The film chronicles the tumultuous three-month period in 1965 when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led a dangerous campaign to secure equal voting rights in the face of violent opposition. The epic march from Selma to Montgomery culminated in President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 one of the most significant victories for the civil rights movement.

""Selma"" an ambitious deeply moving drama about the 1960s civil rights movement has triggered a noisy quarrel just as pseudo-true-story Oscar contenders ""Zero Dark Thirty and ""Argo"" did a couple of years ago. ""Selma"" which has already received four Golden Globe nominations opens with the Rev. Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo right) and his wife Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) dressing formally to receive his Nobel Peace Prize. It shifts quickly to scenes of an ongoing war against black Americans. We observe a horrific attack on a Birmingham church then a racist registrar rejecting an application by a woman (Oprah Winfrey) whose right to vote he has repeatedly denied. Director Ava DuVernay makes every spoken scene and visual frame sharply composed. This is a film that will flesh out every facet. ""Selma"" is a stunning surface-level exploration of Kings groundbreaking 1965 voting-rights march from Selma Ala. across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to the State Capitol in Montgomery. Oyelowos piercing eyes empower a lead performance of pure gravitas. What Daniel Day-Lewis did for Lincoln Oyelowo does for King mimicking his behavior and speech uncannily. He is both completely believable and someone weve never encountered before. Oyelowo presents King at his highs a respected minister a controversial activist pulling political strings a popular hero galvanizing Southern blacks into battalions seeking reform. And we see him at his lows leading hundreds of Selma followers into riot-geared police squads that attack them as if they were pushing treason. Even when it shows King as a scapegoat adulterer and martyr ""Selma"" presents him with care that would have made its subject proud. A powerful scene in which he comforts a man who has just lost a grandson to police brutality is touching to the point of tears. ""Selmas"" missteps come only during a few brief too-deep excursions into the Oval Office. Fans of Lyndon B. Johnson are angry that ""Selma"" shows the president absorbed by the unwinnable Vietnam War less focused than King on creating federal mandates to ban every factor denying the black populations right to vote. Johnson is shown ordering the ongoing smear campaign by FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover who secretly wiretapped Kings every move. Paramount Pictures David Oyelowo center as Martin Luther King Jr. and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King in ""Selma."" ""Selma"" plays fast and loose with those facts which are at most 5 percent of its story. The authorization for Kings notorious surveillance came from Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1963. Johnson considered the Voting Rights Act of 1965 created in cordial cooperation with King his greatest legislative achievement. The film does not present itself as a documentary. It is drama inspired by history with all of a dramas need for shorthand. Johnson never literally told King ""Youve got one problem Ive got 101"" but the films use of it feels outrageous only if you havent seen the incendiary performances by Tom Wilkinson and Oyelowo. What is unquestionably true is that ""Selmas"" makers have created a work of art that speaks their conscience. While it embellishes it also presents insightful honesty. If its not perfect its far better than countless spurious films in which Hollywood has rewritten history. If we examine ""Selma"" as film using artistic license on its own terms not as propaganda or journalism it is outstandingly good. Brilliantly acted beautifully shot emotionally touching and filled with stunning action set pieces its achievements are not to be scoffed at. It sees the world in colors richer than black and white.

Carmen Ejogo below gives a strong ... more Photo Atsushi Nishijima / Associated Press ""Selma"" review Very good movie on a great subject 1 / 6 Back to Gallery There are times when watching David Oyelowo in ""Selma"" that its really easy to believe youre looking at Martin Luther King Jr. Aside from the accidents of age size and appearance Oyelowo has studied Kings gestures not only his public manner -- his dramatic use of his arms and hands -- but his more private side the weary yet determined quality he had in one-on-one interviews. In the movies more private moments Oyelowo even sounds like King. What he cant match -- probably no one could -- is Kings powerful oratorical voice. Still this is a remarkable performance remarkable not only in its force but in its strength and precision. Oyelowo is reason alone to see ""Selma"" and if you need another reason theres Carmen Ejogo as a lovely strong and haunted Coretta Scott King. No ""Selma"" is not a great movie. But its a very good movie on a great subject the events leading up to Kings 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery and to the passing of the Voting Rights Act. In the best sense its a movie about politics specifically about how things get done and much of the drama involves the maneuvering between King and President Lyndon Johnson who has his own agenda and timetable and wont move unless pushed. And Johnson was not an easy man to push. To make ""Selma"" not just function but soar this movie needed a Johnson as compelling as its King. But Tom Wilkinson as Johnson is all wrong even aside from the fact that hes 10 years too old and looks like Richard Nixon. Wilkinson flails in the role. Sometimes he has a Texas accent. Sometimes he doesnt. Worst of all Wilkinsons Johnson isnt frightening and he needed to be in order to make those scenes with King really pop. By all accounts Johnson was a terrifying figure in person huge and relentless and with a look in his eyes that was just a little bit crazy. Imagine going into the office of that man the most powerful in the world and telling him what to do. King did that and we should feel it. But we dont quite because Wilkinson plays Johnson as reasonable and fretting. You can blame the actor but when some of the best scenes in a movie dont land with the right force the director must get some of the blame. Director Ava DuVernay handles the two-person scenes between King and Coretta Scott King impeccably with a real feeling for the unstated communication between couples. But a climactic scene such as Johnsons ""We shall overcome"" speech before a joint session of Congress is tossed away. Throughout there are little inexactitudes some important some merely nagging. Tim Roth plays George Wallace but hes older than Wallace and lacks that nasty bantam rooster quality Wallace had. At one point King calls the great gospel singer Mahalia Jackson and has her sing to him. Jackson had a magnificent contralto voice. The Jackson here is a mezzo. And why is Dylan Baker playing mean old J. Edgar Hoover (albeit in a single scene)? Until they said Hoovers name I thought somehow Robert McNamara was entering the story. Still DuVernay gets most of the big things right including the most important thing all the activism scenes. The marches and street demonstrations are conveyed with a respect for historical accuracy and a you-are-there sense of the dangers faced. To see this is to remember that Kings success was by no means assured. Easily people could have been beaten up and killed without anything being changed. History has a way of seeming inevitable but only after it happens. The value of ""Selma"" is it shows how things could have gone another way. Its a testament to Martin Luther Kings vision and to the courage it took to pursue that vision. But it does something else too. It shows the awfulness of being in possession of that vision the terrible responsibility of it. Oyelowo captures two looks that King sometimes had. One look was of seeing into the absolute abyss of the human soul and history. And the other was of seeing something better in the distance that he wasnt going to get to. To see ""Selma"" is to feel and appreciate anew the burden of greatness. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com Twitter MickLaSalle Selma Drama.

Atsushi Nishijima In this image released by Paramount Pictures David Oyelowo portrays Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a scene from ""Selma."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Atsushi Nishijima) Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) is in Oslo Norway to be presented the Nobel Peace Prize when he has a bit of trouble tying an ascot he plans to wear to the ceremony. His wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) cant help but be amused. But then shes grateful for a lighter moment in a relationship that has come to have its difficulties.As a clergyman and activist King has become a symbol of the hopes and dreams of millions of black Americans and has enjoyed significant success. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 has made segregation illegal with the support of President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson). But when it comes to dismantling the legal barriers that deny blacks the right to vote LBJ and MLK seem to be at an impasse.Kings woes arent limited to the White House. Things are getting stressful at home as Coretta weighs the benefits and drawbacks of being married to one of the most powerful men in America. It all comes down to a strategy -- marching from Selma Ala. to the state capitol in Montgomery in 1965 -- that tests Kings nonviolent philosophy and gauges whether white Americans choose to be conscientious or complacent.""Selma"" offers a visceral take on a pivotal moment in American history. Working from a screenplay by Paul Webb director Ava DuVernay (""Middle of Nowhere"") captures the danger and uncertainty of the civil rights movement while portraying King as a man who isnt always comfortable with whats demanded of him. And Oyelowo who starred in ""Middle of Nowhere"" and is perhaps best known for ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" is just the right actor for the role. Oyelowo takes full advantage of his close physical resemblance to King but he wisely avoids mere impersonation delivering a performance thats as sensitive as it is spellbinding. In an era of comic-book movies ""Selma"" is an impressive reminder of the real-life struggle for human dignity.What ""Selma""  Four stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 204  Content Thematic material including violence and brief strong language Carmen Ejogo takes on a familiar role Coretta Scott King The ""Selma"" actress also played the civil rights icon in HBOs ""Boycott.""

David Oyelowo stars as Martin Luther King Jr. VPC Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com 1045 a.m. MST January 9 2015Ava DuVernays dramatization of Kings efforts to end the Jim Crow era in the South and pass the Voting Rights Act is devastatingly relevant and David Oyelowo is stunning as the civil-rights leader.The cast of ""Selma"" from left Tessa Thompson Corey Reynolds David Oyelowo and Colman Domingo.(Photo Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures)Story Highlights4.5 stars (out of 5)Director Ava DuVernay avoids hagiography and zooms in with intimate detail on Martin Luther King Jr.The film focuses on the months when he organized peaceful protest marches from Selma to Montgomery.British actor David Oyelowo is a revelation bringing grace and torment to a historical figure.On the one hand its amazing that no studio or filmmaker has had the temerity to tackle a historical figure as notable as Martin Luther King Jr. in a major motion picture until now. On the other hand perhaps its a good thing that honor was reserved for Ava DuVernay who with the help of a dream cast has made a somber and distressingly relevant tribute to King and his fellow compatriots in the civil-rights movement of the 1960s.Like Steven Spielbergs excellent 2012 film ""Lincoln"" DuVernays film smartly avoids hagiography and zooms in with intimate detail on a person who since his assassination has become more legend than human being. She also keeps the time line narrow -- the movie is called ""Selma"" and not ""King"" for a reason -- on the months in 1965 when King helped organize peaceful protest marches from Selma to Montgomery a 54-mile trek beset with peril and the opportunity to focus national attention on their cause.The film opens with King (David Oyelowo) preparing to receive the Nobel Peace Prize having a humble conversation with his wife about their mortgage. That scene of placid domesticity is shattered by the one that follows and your stomach clenches at the sight of four Black girls descending church steps in frills and lace -- anyone with a cursory knowledge of the civil-rights movement can anticipate the bomb blast that leaves four little broken bodies scattered on the wrecked churchs floor. There may be a Peace Prize on their side but that doesnt mean theres peace.Especially not in Alabama where Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) a virulent segregationist openly defies the dictates of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which declared segregation illegal. He oversees a system so corrupt that would-be voter Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey in a moving performance) is turned away from the registration office because she cant name all 60 of Alabamas county judges an arbitrary test administered by a racist clerk.King focuses his attention on Alabama teaming up with the local Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to organize peaceful protests in an attempt to strong-arm President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) into supporting legislation that would become the Voting Rights Act. The protests are anything but peaceful of course with supplications and resilient demands for equality brought to their knees by police batons. DuVernay films these pointed scenes of violence with both grace and brutality; an attack on the Edmund Pettus Bridge moves like warfare as poetry but feels no less painful for it.It is not hyperbole to say Oyelowo is a revelation. The British actor brings phenomenal humanity grace and torment to a historical figure who once seemed to loom too large a legend to make flesh on screen. ""Selma"" couldnt obtain permission from the King family to use his famous (and copyrighted) speeches which in retrospect might have been a blessing. Instead of handicapping the film the absence of Kings speeches forces the film to find more subtle and inventive ways to convey Kings oratorical skills and gift for negotiation -- ways that dont force the audience to compare Oyelowo with their newsreel memories of King.Carmen Ejogo is marvelous as Coretta Scott King who brings nuance to the ""long-suffering wife"" role in a marriage strained by infidelity and constant stress.If the film has a flaw its arguably in the overt vilification of the opposition. Not that they arent villains -- there are few politicians as historically unsympathetic as Wallace (and thats saying something) and the South was plagued by the Ku Klux Klan and racist policing. As odious as those figures are theyre also human beings ones who arent graced with the deft touch that DuVernay and Oyelowo bring to their treatment of King. But its a minor quibble; you dont get riled up by Wallace being too evil instead of just evil enough.It would be an important film in whatever year it was released. But that its being released now after weeks of televised race-related protests in modern America imbues it with a spirit of tragic necessity. If not for the bouffant hairdos and cat-eye glasses of the 60s youd almost think you were watching the news.Selma4.5 stars (out of 5)Director Ava DuVernay.Cast David Oyelowo Carmen Ejogo Tim Roth.Rating PG-13 for disturbing thematic material including violence a suggestive moment and brief strong language.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

Sure civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (portrayed with careful dignity by David Oyelowo) serves as architect engine lightning rod and general for the organization and execution of a march from Selma Alabama to the State Capitol in Montgomery seat of pro-segregation governor George Wallace. But director Ava DuVernay working from a script by first-timer Paul Webb wisely shifts the emphasis away from the person -- its hard to make a movie about a saint even a secular one -- and onto the process what had to happen to make a march like this happen? Well for one thing King had to play several rounds of political chess with President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) here portrayed as a sympathetic soul who nevertheless was not about to be bullied into adopting someone elses timeline church bombings or no church bombings. Their frank and flinty exchanges make for the most entertaining of the many ""heres what you need to understand"" conversations that fill the film; elsewhere you may find yourself surprised that the character-cum-mouthpiece isnt simply lecturing to the camera. Still the machinations do merit exposition if only to understand the enormity of the moment. And they keep the piety at bay throughout these are people figuring out how to fight a war without firing a shot straining to stand together as their opposition seeks to knock them down and drive them apart. Speaking of the opposition Tim Roth looks to be having a good time in his portrayal of the weaselly Wallace. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona Related links ""Selma + gospel at the Central Library""  June 3 2015 This movie is not currently in theaters.

The regal ""The Kings Speech"" -- about the stuttering Prince Albert -- is a recent example of a smart crowd-pleaser that made history come alive. But for Americans even that great British history lesson has neither the emotional effect nor the staying power of ""Selma"" -- not by a long shot.The timely ""Selma"" ranks as one of the best in the genre. Polished and riveting the civil rights drama is a must-see for both those who lived through the 60s and those who have only read what happened in textbooks.""Selma"" depicts the courageous actions taken by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (a stunning David Oyelowo) and his followers to end institutional voting discrimination based on race in nine states mostly in the deep South. Their efforts paid off when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson.In the assured hands of director Ava DuVernay we see the blood sweat and fear that fomented change. We learn of the FBI harassment that tried to stop it. We also get incisive portraits of a heroic but ultimately human man and a nation crippled by a racism that still festers 50 years later.Advertisement ""Selma"" has a big story to tell and does so in an ambitious and satisfying manner. Its most powerful sequences depict the landmark protest marches organized by King that took him and his followers from Selma to Montgomery Alabama home of separationist Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth). DuVernays re-creation of the first failed protest the so-called ""Bloody Sunday"" slams home the brutal way police beat demonstrators as they marched over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It is wrenching to watch. Two other protest marches came after the last one finally reaching its goal.Paul Webbs screenplay powerfully exposes the racism of the time and focuses on the personalities and the political machinations involved in the civil rights movement. We become flies on the wall in organizational meetings and boardrooms including at the White House with LBJ (Tom Wilkinson doing fine work in a part that has drawn criticism for underrepresenting the presidents commitment to the civil rights legislation). It also addresses Kings unfaithfulness to wife Coretta (an outstanding Carmen Ejogo) his own doubts and the fears he shares with his wife for their familys safety.Oyelowo a British actor is in full command at every emotional turn. And when the actor who is perhaps best known for his role in ""Lee Daniels The Butler"" stands up and orates he sets the screen afire. The film features numerous other strong performances including Oprah Winfreys as Annie Lee Cooper a protester who was denied her right to vote and refused to be silenced. Throughout the director conveys what it was like to be a black American living in the South. To do so ""Selma"" revisits tragic historic events such as the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four black children and injured other churchgoers along with the senseless deaths of many civil rights supporters.All of it serves as a painful reminder of the sacrifices made to achieve equality and justice. DuVernay wasnt able to use Kings exact words for Kings electrifying speeches due to copyright issues but her film is electricity itself as it burrows into the soul of a man a movement and a country.The film a testament to how focused effort and strong leadership can lead to change that still resonates half a century later is especially timely given the race-related outrage that has boiled over recently in Ferguson Missouri and throughout the country. Its also topical in its central theme coming on the heels of the Supreme Courts 2013 decision that has all but defanged the Voting Rights Act. For all these reasons ""Selma"" demands to be seen now and by the generations that follow.selma     Rating PG-13 (for disturbing thematic material including violence a suggestive moment and brief strong language) Cast David Oyelowo Carmen Ejogo Tom Wilkinson Oprah Winfrey Tim RothDirector Ava DuVernayRunning time 2 hours 7 minutes Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Selma Video Rated PG-13  128 minutes  2015 Martin Luther King is the central character but not the central focus of this docudrama about the historic marches King led through Alabama in 1965 which helped bring about the passage of the Voting Rights Act. The film is less concerned with him than with the operational mechanics of the civil rights movement; critic Glenn Kenny has aptly compared this to Steven Soderberghs Che with which it shares a process-oriented view of history. Shifting perspective between multiple characters screenwriter Paul Webb invites us to consider the events in the context of media culture and federal politics as well as black historical experience; by contrast director Ava DuVernay (Middle of Nowhere) avoids ""big picture"" thinking staging many principal scenes as chamber drama. This is lucid in its political analysis and sobering in its depictions of racially motivated violence though it sometimes comes off as stolid.

Richard Corliss Jan. 1 2015 SHARE In Ava DuVernays retelling of Martin Luther Kings leadership in the Selma-to-Montgomery marches and the passage of the Voting Rights Act we see how much King achieved -- and how little we have advanced + READ ARTICLE Correction appended Jan. 12 2015 ""I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy"" said Lyndon Johnson in his nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress on March 15 1965. ""At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in mans unending search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma Alabama."" The President was referring to the ""Bloody Sunday"" confrontation in Selma Ala. on March 7 when Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark and his deputies met about 600 peaceful marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge with nightsticks tear gas and charging horses. The naked brutality of this assault -- just nine days after the young unarmed black Baptist minister Jimmie Lee Jackson had died from an Alabama State Troopers gunshot -- spurred LBJ to bring the Voting Rights Act to Congress. A Texas Democrat who knew his party could lose the South for decades if he championed equal rights for blacks Johnson nonetheless boldly declared ""There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem."" His comments reverberate eerily today when police again can kill unarmed black men and face no legal punishment -- and when the Voting Rights Act which Johnson signed on August 6 1965 with Martin Luther King Jr. Rosa Parks and John Lewis by his side gets effectively defanged 48 years later by the Supreme Court. So Ava DuVernays Selma a vivid retelling of the months leading up to the three historic marches from Selma to Birmingham carries a message that has lost none of its heroic tragic relevance. If not quite in quality then certainly in import and impact this is the film of the year -- of 1965 and perhaps of 2014. The film currently playing on 19 screens in New York and Los Angeles opens in the rest of the country January 9 -- the week before the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. This solid expertly managed drama with its stark images of good men standing up to entrenched government evil has earned critical hosannahs and could be the breakout favorite among year-end contenders for the Academy Award. With Oscar night falling on February 22 just two days before the 50th anniversary of Jimmie Lee Jacksons death Selma could be propelled to a Best Picture win as much by the Academy members political consciences as by the films undeniable power. Its creepy even to speculate about this but one more unjustified police killing of an unarmed black could assure the movie of an Oscar sweep for Picture for David Oyelowo as King in the Best Actor category and for DuVernay who would become the first black woman chosen as Best Director. Dr. King would appreciate that awful conundrum that violence can be a goad to good. In Georgia he had attempted voter-registration drives that as NPR critic Bob Mondello noted ""received little media coverage because the authorities there had met nonviolent protests with nonviolence."" Alabama promised more fertile ground for telegenic confrontation. Its Governor the pint-size pit bull George Wallace had proclaimed ""Segregation now segregation tomorrow and segregation forever"" (Would Wallace be rooting this years University of Alabama top-ranked football squad dominated by black players?) And Jim Clarks rambunctious police force was a good bet to be rough on pacifist marchers with dark faces. King no less than the video newshound played by Jake Gyllenhaal in Nightcrawler knew the dictum of editors in the nations press and TV news If it bleeds it leads. King wasnt a cynic or a sadist; he was a political realist. And Selma from a cogent concise script by the British screenwriter Paul Webb is all about realpolitik in the service of social idealism. In his March 15 speech Johnson said he had summoned the Special Session of Congress in response to ""the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people."" Yet his understanding of the urgent need for a Voting Rights Act was sown in secret meetings between the President (Tom Wilkinson) and the preacher. Johnson knew from Kings August 1963 March on Washington that the Rev. Dr. was not just the eloquent voice of the civil rights movement; he was in showbiz terms its director and impresario. Selma shows Kings mastery at maneuvering and manipulating. He must woo Johnson -- whose immediate priority is his War on Poverty and who tells King ""This votin thing is gonna hafta wait"" -- even as he and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference cohort Rev. Ralph Abernathy (Colman Domingo) wage negotiations with the younger more restless leaders of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee including John Lewis (Stephan James) who had been mounting challenges to Alabamas racist restrictions on voting long before the SCLC came on the scene. DuVernay like King came late to the Selma project. Michael Mann and Stephen Frears had considered directing Webbs script. Lee Daniels (Precious) got so far as announcing his leading actors Oyelowo as King and a gaudy supporting cast of Liam Neeson as LBJ Hugh Jackman as Jim Clark and Cedric the Entertainer as Ralph Abernathy. When Daniels moved on to direct The Butler Oyelowo recommended DuVernay who had directed two low-budget films and worked on Precious as a publicity adviser for the job. She worked on the script sheared the budget to a bankable 20 million and impressively managed a huge cast with dozens of speaking roles and in the scenes shot on Edmund Pettus Bridge hundreds of extras. No less than King or the current U.S. President DuVernay proved herself a wizardly community organizer. Not exactly a hagiography of King -- whose life works oratory and death certainly deserve all reverence -- Selma tiptoes around the delicate issue of the preachers infidelities. The movie traces the monitoring of King by the FBI and its boss J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker) who calls him a ""political and moral degenerate."" But it raises the widely documented charges of adultery only as slurs concentrating instead on the symbiotic love of King and his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo). King does make one furtive late-night call to a woman gospel thrush Mahalia Jackson (Ledisi Young) whom he asks to raise his troubled spirits by singing the spiritual ""Precious Lord Take My Hand."" The fascinating chapter of Kings balancing act of his sacred mission with his sexual appetites will have to await another film -- for astonishingly this is the first King biography made for the big screen. Given that Dr. Kings quarreling children did not give DuVernay permission to quote their fathers speeches -- recall that they charged more than 800000 for Kings words to be chiseled into the monument statue on the National Mall -- Oyelowo wisely didnt try to mimic the soaring of Kings tremolo. This is a movie set not on great lawns but mostly in back rooms where a forceful whisper can have more effect than a pulpit homily. Born in Oxford England to Nigerian parents Oyelowo gives a warm not fevered performance and lends King a presence that makes everyone from LBJ to Selmas most devout parishioner (Oprah Winfrey) feel the power of his argument the singe of his soul. If King had not been assassinated in 1968 just three years after the Selma marches he would be 86 on January 16 the memorial holiday that Americans celebrate with extra shopping and skiing. What would he have to say in majestic cadences that once called America to tolerance about the wrongful deaths of young black men? In a way we know because he said it all a half-century ago. A movie like Selma should be a relic in a time capsule from 1965 a clue to how well we heeded Kings words and how far we have advanced. Instead it is a reminder that the ""American problem"" has yet to be solved. An earlier version of this story misstated the route of the march. It was from Selma to Montgomery.

"Selma review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Selma Selma Atsushi Nishijima / Paramount Pictures Scene from ""Selma."" Scene from ""Selma."" (Atsushi Nishijima / Paramount Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune David Oyelowo stars in Ava DuVernays fine stirring account of Martin Luther Kings 1965 Selma march You can scan any directors resume at your peril because their work is on the screen and in the right circumstances as with director Ava DuVernays fine full and confident ""Selma"" the work speaks for itself.DuVernays previous films include the hip-hop documentary ""This Is the Life"" and the features ""I Will Follow"" and ""The Middle of Nowhere"" but for nearly 15 years she worked in studio marketing and publicity. The great surprise and considerable relief regarding ""Selma"" is that you dont sense the director packaging her subject in an aggressive or unseemly way or presenting him as a series of 30- or 60-second awards campaign spots. Like ""Lincoln"" written by Tony Kushner and directed by Steven Spielberg DuVernays ""Selma"" ushers us into the world of the backstage back-room and back-scratching political process dramatizing how the sausage was actually made. Though ""Selma"" is a rangy ensemble piece dealing perhaps with two or three too many characters Martin Luther King Jr. remains very much at the storys center. It hardly needs stating Coming off the year 2014 when white-on-black violence dominated the news with scary regularity Kings methods results and achievements are more vital and timely than ever.This is no soup-to-nuts King biopic. The script by Paul Webb an English playwright focuses ""Selma"" on the months leading up to the three King marches one horrifically bloody from Selma to Montgomery Ala. in early 1965. DuVernay did an uncredited and reportedly substantial rewrite shifting the emphasis away from Kings dealings with President Lyndon B. Johnson. To be sure LBJ (played by the sly and exemplary Tom Wilkinson) is a major supporting player in ""Selma"" though as with just about every piece of fictionalized history to come out of Hollywood theres been some debate regarding the relationships as presented. Various historians and LBJ confidants have called foul on the movies depiction of Johnson as less than fully on board with Kings political desires.The Selma marches put the cause for African-American voting rights front and center and led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 one year after segregation was officially outlawed putting Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth in high snivel) on the wrong side of history. But that anti-segregation law held no teeth and local white-run districts had little interest in accommodating change. Selma resonates now more than ever Mark Caro The conversation came the morning after protesters rallied in the wake of the grand jury decision not to indict the police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner so the topic at hand -- a movie depicting events of almost 50 years earlier -- felt especially immediate. ""Im really... The conversation came the morning after protesters rallied in the wake of the grand jury decision not to indict the police officer involved in the chokehold death of Eric Garner so the topic at hand -- a movie depicting events of almost 50 years earlier -- felt especially immediate. ""Im really... (Mark Caro) I dont see the LBJ scenes as particularly problematic; they are however ginned up for conflicts sake and the best of ""Selma"" avoids that sort of artful contrivance. The movie culminates with the three marches but getting there ""Selma"" takes all sorts of rich and compelling detours and side roads. Thats where the human interest lies.David Oyelowo plays King as a fiercely concentrated man who is no stranger to doubts and weakness and while there are sequences designed to showcase Kings rhetorical and oratory brilliance director DuVernay didnt have the budget (roughly 20 million) to gain access to Kings actual speeches. This turned out to be good for the movie. When ""Selma"" allows King to soar before a crowd the words are elegant in character yet unfamiliar because theyre not the famous speeches were used to hearing. Oyelowos performance subtle and often very still exerts both classical control and a lived-in naturalism. Its too bad Carmen Ejogo doesnt get a little more screen time as Coretta King but she makes the most of what she has as when Coretta listens to an FBI surveillance tape of an apparent King liaison with one of his mistresses (all this is handled with extreme discretion by DuVernay) and he says its not him on the tape. She says simply at a low boil ""I know what you sound like."" Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. We get to know a lot of Kings inner circle in ""Selma"" from civil rights attorney Fred Gray (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee leader James Forman (Trai Byers). Oprah Winfrey plays Annie Lee Cooper one of a precious few black Alabama citizens who dared register to vote unsuccessfully but valiantly.The March 71965 Selma march sequence is not easy to watch. More than 500 protesters were assaulted by Alabama state troopers and local law enforcement officials and all the tear-gassed bloodied marchers hit the evening TV news with a vengeance. Kings instincts for media interest were spot-on.DuVernays instincts for keeping a dozen or more balls in the air narratively are nearly as impressive. By the time we arrive at the films postscript detailing the fates of several of the people chronicled by ""Selma"" its almost impossible not to be moved by their sacrifice and their courage. Even writing a sentence like that risks patronizing history and its many players.The movie makes a few missteps. With so many subplots rolling through ""Selma"" some of the scenes are necessarily sketchier than others. Having Roth play Wallace in the same movie as Dylan Baker oozing slime as J. Edgar Hoover puts the snivel meter well past 11. And as impressive and convincing as Oyelowo is throughout ""Selma"" there are times when we feel were about to dig more deeply into Kings emotional makeup but the film switches tracks and gets back to this or that side narrative.These are minor frustrations in a major achievement. With ""Selma"" which begins with Martin and Coretta backstage at the Nobel Peace Prize awards in a hushed and lovely exchange DuVernay proves that all she needed to make this sort of movie was the opportunity to make this sort of movie. And since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act Id say everything at stake and on screen in ""Selma"" feels as if its speaking to us directly today in a humane and urgent voice.Selma - 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for disturbing thematic material including violence a suggestive moment and brief strong language)Running time 207Opens Thursday at AMC River East and Showplace Icon theaters; opens wide Jan. 9mjphillipstribpub.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Reviews Review Winter Sleep Review Pelican Dreams Review A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-selma-review-20141231-column.html#navtype=barker&barkername=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It,200,selma19,selma,chicagotribune

One struggle ends just to go on to the next and the next."" The words are uttered by Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo) in a stem-winding sermon but they offer a clue to the underlying logic of director Ava DuVernays remarkable film Selma. The movie does not present itself as a biography of its world-renowned protagonist nor as a history of the movement he led. Rather it portrays a single brief chapter in the long ongoing struggle for civil rights and it does so with exceptional focus and intelligence.The movie begins with a bit of dramatic sleight-of-hand interspersing Kings acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize (which took place in December 1964) with a heartbreaking dramatization of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing that had killed four girls in Birmingham the previous year. DuVernay then settles her gaze on the events leading up to three planned marches from Selma to Montgomery in 1965--marches that directly led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act later that year.Related Story Qamp;A Selma Director Ava DuVernays on Saving MLK From I Have a Dream Like Lincoln another film that had the wisdom to tell its tale in microcosm Selma is the story not only of a man but of a process. In place of the internal horse-trading of the earlier picture DuVernays movie concerns itself with the application of external leverage. Unable to persuade Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to push for a voting bill King and his fellow leaders in the nonviolent movement turn to the most precious asset they have their own bodies. The political arithmetic is as precise as it is chilling If they demonstrate in Selma they will be beaten or even killed by the forces of local Sheriff Jim Clarke and the state police; those beatings will be covered in the papers and on the news; and eventually the activists hope the revulsion of everyday Americans will reach a tipping point and force Johnsons hand.DuVernays film is equally stark and clear-eyed when it comes to the mechanisms used to prevent black Americans from registering to vote across the South poll taxes civics tests the need to be ""vouched for"" by an existing voter the publication of ones name and address in the paper in the event that he or she successfully registers--an invitation to violence. So too with the political stakes in question which include not only the right to elect leaders but also to sit on juries--the same juries that having historically been all-white consistently acquitted any white man charged with anti-black violence.If this makes the movie sound like a civics lesson then I am doing it an injustice. Selma is a film of uncommon power insight and even humor. Oyelowo is superb in the central role of King capturing his famous cadences without ever descending into mimicry. This is a life-sized portrait of a larger-than-life figure and never more so than in the scenes between King and his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) their marriage strained not only by the ever-present threat of violence but also by his own serial infidelities which the movie handles with tact but does not shy away from.The supporting cast is likewise strong notably Colman Domingo (as Ralph Abernathy) Andre Holland (as Andrew Young) and Stephan James (as John Lewis) but also Lorraine Toussaint Wendell Pierce Jeremy Strong Common and Giovanni Ribisi. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Martin Sheen never quite disappear into the minor characters they play but remarkably Oprah Winfrey (who also produced) does so with utter grace and ease.King and his fellow leaders in the nonviolent movement turn to the most precious asset they have their own bodies.Which brings me to Wilkinson and Tim Roth who plays Alabama Governor George Wallace. The casting is a touch odd and both actors take some time to settle into their roles. But crucially neither is trying to do an impression of the character he plays. They allow us to accept them gradually without falling back on elaborate makeup or twitchy mannerisms like the disastrous parade of presidential caricatures that populated last years The Butler. (Ironically the director of the latter Lee Daniels was originally slated to direct Selma.)DuVernay is working on a vastly larger scale here than she has before (her previous feature Middle of Nowhere was an intimate portrait of a medical students struggles when her husband is sentenced to prison) but she does so with extraordinary self-assurance. Whether filming the easy camaraderie of King with his friends or the tense meetings between his Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee or the outright horror of the ""Bloody Sunday"" police brutality that took place on Selmas Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7 1965 she and cinematographer Bradford Young are in full control of their vision. The result is a stately sober film at times uplifting and at others agonizing. Its a snapshot of a moment in time that seems both distant from our own and yet still unbearably too close.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place.

Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

If Hollywood was waiting consciously or otherwise for a black filmmaker to come along who could handle this topic then Ava DuVernay (who spent many years working as a film publicist and has made only two previous features) was worth the wait. ""Selma"" is gripping inspiring and sometimes terrifying historical drama loaded with specific detail that brings a turning point of the civil rights movement back from black-and-white obscurity to present-tense urgency. DuVernay cannot have known that her film would be released in a season when fateful collisions between police and black citizens have made the violence on the Edmund Pettus Bridge seems especially relevant but she makes us feel both how near we are to that moment of national crisis and how far we have come.In a richly textured and finely balanced leading performance from David Oyelowo ""Selma"" also returns Martin Luther King Jr. from sainthood and martyrdom to human scale without making him seem ignoble. This King is a consummate politician and a bit of a chameleon; if we know him as one of the 20th centurys greatest orators a preacher of righteousness we see him here as a back-room strategist a shrewd operator and a mans man with a rocky personal life. It is no longer heretical to acknowledge that Kings marriage to Coretta Scott King (played by Carmen Ejogo) was not the perfect facade they presented to the world. King spent much of his time away from home clearly put the cause before his family and had several other lovers. The recently exposed letter from J. Edgar Hoover threatening King with exposure and humiliation plays a role in the plot of ""Selma"" with the bitter twist that Hoover isnt telling Coretta King anything about her husband that she doesnt already know.Although Oyelowo is both magnetic and hard to pin down in the central role this isnt a King biopic but a vertical and historical portrait of a moment. (Its often tremendous photography is by Bradford Young cinematographer of the moment who also shot J.C. Chandors forthcoming ""A Most Violent Year."") ""Selma"" probably covers too much terrain to remain fully coherent but you have to admire its sweep which encompasses scenes in the Oval Office and the Alabama governors mansion showdowns between Kings mainstream civil rights movement and the black radicals of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee old ladies trying to register to vote in flyspeck county courthouses and even a highly uncomfortable conversation between Coretta King and Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch). I briefly wanted the whole movie to be about that encounter but only because Im crazy that way. In fact Paul Webbs screenplay and DuVernays direction come close to the impossible in capturing how a historical turning point was reached by a bunch of short-sighted people all looking out for their own interests with at the center of the storm one man and one movement who (as they say) kept their eyes on the prize.If you dont know the history of the Selma marches from Selma in March of 1965 - well its almost all in the movie. You dont really need much of a primer. But heres the deal Segregation had been outlawed the previous year and the white South was still reeling. White liberals all over the country who generally supported equality for African-Americans were generally willing to let things cool down for a while despite the obvious fact that an entire set of local codes and regulations prevented the vast majority of black people from voting south of the Mason-Dixon line. King and other civil rights leaders wanted to make the point that federal action was required to secure voting rights and settled on Selma Alabama - a majority black city with an entirely white government - as the test case. After repeated failures in registering African-American voters they launched a series of efforts to march the 54 miles of highway from Selma to the state capitol in Montgomery. The first such march on March 9 was the one when 600 unarmed black citizens were viciously beaten and tear-gassed by state troopers and local deputies captured in news footage that made Selma infamous around the world. You Might Also Like DuVernay and Webb appear eager not to leave anything out or elide any behind-the-scenes complexities of the Selma story while also trying to provide snapshots of the leading characters. So while we spend most of our time near King as he plots and ponders we also see Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) stewing in his office or conferring with Hoover (Dylan Baker) or notorious Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) nursing a highball before the TV trapped between Washington ""the Negroes"" and the local yokels making his state look bad. If you notice a pattern in the casting of ""Selma"" its an odd one In this consummately American story the four biggest and most charismatic roles - the Kings Johnson and Wallace - are all filled by English actors. Coming hard on the heels of ""12 Years a Slave"" in which the principal actors were all British or Irish is it time for a little direct action on behalf of American talent? Do our actors really suck so dreadfully they cant play leading figures from their own history? I would further argue that the scenes with Johnson and Wallace although intrinsically interesting drag down the drama somewhat and that every minute were away from the firecracker atmosphere of rural Alabama detracts from the overall impact. ""Selma"" ends with the up-with-people conclusion still demanded from a studio film - well they marched and now there is obviously no more racism - and for a movie directed by a woman it seems only half-aware of its gender politics. There are essentially no female characters except Ejogos Coretta King who stands around looking beautiful and pained most of the time. That is no doubt true to the history of the civil rights movement as to the white left of the time. I suspect that the number of times we see women bustling through the background with coffeepots and plates of food is meant as commentary but if so its rather too subtle.If ""Selma"" is limited by the kind of film it needed to be and by what its studio proprietors wanted to sell its still the best and most intimate fictional portrayal of the civil rights movement by a long shot. DuVernay clearly yearns to make movies that start conversations not spectacles that sit there at the end of the year like cats on an ottoman attracting glowing reviews and hardware. Although I imagine shell make better films than ""Selma"" its best scenes are among the most memorable movie moments of 2014. As she showed in her masterful second feature ""Middle of Nowhere"" she understands the black family the black home and the internal structure of black life as almost no white person ever could and she throws open the doors to invite us in.""Selma"" is now playing in New York and Los Angeles with national release to follow in January.

Mondello notes that recent protests make the film resonate today. ROBERT SIEGEL HOST The movie ""Selma"" opens tomorrow. Its the story of the marches that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Critic Bob Mondello is not alone in noting that protests over the killing of unarmed black men make ""Selma"" especially timely. BOB MONDELLO BYLINE An African-American woman named Annie Lee Cooper approaches a white registrar near the start of ""Selma"" and he does not seem pleased to see her. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") CLAY CHAPPELL (As registrar) You work for Mr. Dunn down at the rest home aint that right? OPRAH WINFREY (As Annie Lee Cooper) Yes sir. CHAPPELL (As registrar) I wonder what old Dunn would say when I tell him one of his gals down here stirring a fuss. WINFREY (As Annie Lee Cooper) I aint stirring no fuss. Im just here trying to register to vote. MONDELLO In 1964 Selma Alabama has more black residents than white ones but the voting roles are almost entirely white. Were about to find out why. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") CHAPPELL (As registrar) Recite the Constitutions preamble. Know what a preamble is? MONDELLO She does. She has prepared. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") WINFREY (As Annie Lee Cooper) We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union... CHAPPELL (As registrar) How many county judges in Alabama? MONDELLO Her eyes widen. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") WINFREY (As Annie Lee Cooper) Sixty-seven. MONDELLO His eyes narrow. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") CHAPPELL (As registrar) Name them. MONDELLO With a satisfied smirk at her dismay he picks up a rubber stamp and does what clerks across the South have done many times - he stamps her registration form rejected. (SOUNDBITE OF STAMPING) MONDELLO It is against this background that Martin Luther King Jr. arrives in Selma. His mostly unsuccessful registration drives in Georgia had received little media coverage because the authorities there had met nonviolent protests with nonviolence. Alabama under Governor George Wallace has a less sunny reputation and when King is knocked down on his arrival in town... (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR (As character) Dr. King. MONDELLO By a white supremacists punch. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") DAVID OYELOWO (As Martin Luther King Jr.) I tell you that white boy can hit. MONDELLO He knows hes come to the right place for a confrontation. And with a country sheriff whos eager to give it to him he sets about the task of rallying supporters. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") OYELOWO (As Martin Luther King Jr.) As long as I am unable to exercise my constitutional right to vote I do not have command of my own life. MONDELLO Actor David Oyelowo mostly makes King quietly persuasive a practical planner behind the scenes but give him a crowd and hes magnetic. OYELOWO (As Martin Luther King Jr.) Those that have gone before us say no more. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE No more. OYELOWO (As Martin Luther King Jr.) No more. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE No more. OYELOWO (As Martin Luther King Jr.) That means protest. That means march. That means disturb the peace. That means jail. MONDELLO Its probably smart of director Ava DuVernay not to resort to Kings oratory too often but its certainly rousing when she does. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") OYELOWO (As Martin Luther King Jr.) Give us the votes. (APPLAUSE) MONDELLO Elsewhere the movie is mostly about Kings strategizing - what will get the feds involved how best to attract news coverage how to capitalize on it when it comes. DuVernay also lets you in on what this momentous confrontations other players were thinking. President Lyndon Johnson is annoyed at Kings pushing because hes anxious to get on to his war on poverty. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") TOM WILKINSON (As President Lyndon Johnson) Dr. King this thing is just going to have to wait. OYELOWO (As Martin Luther King Jr.) It cannot wait. WILKINSON (As President Lyndon Johnson) You got one big issue. I got a hundred and one. MONDELLO Governor Wallace is calculatingly vicious in opposition. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") TIM ROTH (As Governor Wallace) We will not tolerate agitators attempting to orchestrate a disturbance in this state. MONDELLO Coretta Scott King is concerned but pragmatic in support. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""SELMA"") CARMEN EJOGO (As Coretta Scott King) People are actually saying theyre going to kill our children. They are trying to get inside of your head. MONDELLO That all four of these very southern icons are played by British performers testifies to a skill with accents thats pretty impressive. But no more impressive than the way DuVernay has crafted the films smaller moments so that they lend power and emotion to its big set pieces - the marches. Three and all across Selmas Edmund Pettius Bridge that effectively started the clock ticking for the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In a few weeks well reach the 50th anniversary of those marches an anniversary that comes amid renewed racial friction and a year-and-a-half after the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of that very Voting Rights Act. The films timing in short could hardly be more resonant. And DuVernays most remarkable accomplishment may be that with such passion inspiring material she has made such a measured resolute and levelheaded film. Im Bob Mondello. Copyright (c) 2014 NPR.

In the year-end glut of holiday films a lot of new ones will be around to keep you entertained but The New York Observer wont. Im off to wrap some gifts ring some bells and get some sleep. Well return with our first issue of a brand new year on January 7. Meanwhile heres a rundown of whats coming in the weeks ahead. UNBROKEN Put this one at the top of your must-see list. Angelina Jolie might not in my opinion have yet reached the heights of the acting profession but with this passionate inspired technically awesome and profoundly exciting chronicle of the life of Louie Zamperini the American Olympic athlete who survived 47 days in a lifeboat and two years as a Japanese prisoner of war during World War II she rises to the top rank of first-class film directors in a male-dominated field overcrowded with hacks. Beginning with a troubled childhood as the son of Italian immigrants in California Louie was an outsider who seemed destined for a life of crime but it was the guidance of an older brother that gave him a talisman to live by ""If I can take it I can make it."" Played with enormous charisma and extraordinary physical endurance by rising U.K. newcomer and inevitable future star Jack OConnell Louie moves from the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin to the rank of pilot shot down with two comrades and left wounded and bleeding in the shark-infested waters of the Pacific. Then the capture by the Japanese Navy--plunged into an underground hole where he listened to his best friend being tortured and finally found himself the personal victim of a sadistic commandant (played unflinchingly by the Japanese singer-composer Miyavi) who subjected him to years of unflagging brutality. Angelina Jolies Unbroken tells the story of P.O.W. Louie Zamperini. Its hard to believe anyone could survive inhumanities this severe and still live but Louie earned a Purple Heart realized his dream of attending one last Olympics (in Japan of all places) and went on to tell his story in the critically acclaimed biography Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand which spent 180 weeks on the best-seller list before becoming the source material for this remarkable screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. Ms. Jolies obsession with Louie who died in July at age 97 informs every scene. The air strikes and raft and camp sequences hold equal weight the camerawork by Roger Deakins is magnificent and the vast supporting cast of unknowns including Domhnall Gleeson Garrett Hedlund Finn Wittrock and Luke Treadaway is exemplary. Although it eschews the usual P.O.W. camp cliches Unbroken is probably too grim brutal and depressing for most viewers and the decision to open it on Christmas Day is questionable. But as a tribute to one heros fortitude in refusing to give in to evil it gives off its own admirable feeling of positive spiritual energy that left me feeling good about the best qualities of mankind. One of the finest achievements of the 2014 film year. AMERICAN SNIPER Another war biopic opening on Christmas day with tight two-fisted direction by Clint Eastwood and a compelling centerpiece performance by Bradley Cooper as a Texas rodeo cowboy full of anger and rage who channels his natural-born killer instincts into a life of positive aggression fighting terrorists as Chris Kyle Americas most decorated Navy SEAL. On his first day of duty hes assigned to protect the Marines from enemy snipers killing a woman and a child carrying a grenade in the bargain. From there on his constant raids on Muslim homes grow more repetitive as the mans civilian problems lead to panic and impotence. After four tours of duty 1000 days on the battlefield and 163 kills Chris comes home for good but the psychological damage has been severe. Clint Eastwood directs American Sniper starring Bradley Cooper. With this film Mr. Eastwood seems to dedicate his hawks eye vision of ""supporting the troops"" to an unpopular continuation of the ongoing war in Iraq but his direction has none of the vigor of either of his previous war efforts Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. Bradley Cooper imbues Chris Kyle with the sensitivity charm and adrenalin lacking elsewhere in Jason Halls screenplay and Sienna Miller is very good as his long-suffering wife Taya. But theres no freshness in either the domestic scenes or the combat sequences that all look like outtakes from The Hurt Locker. The locales do at least look authentic though Iraq is played by Morocco. SELMA This somber by-the-numbers movie about Martin Luther King co-produced by Oprah Winfrey is not just about the man the speech or the holiday--but also the ideals and fight for dignity that led to the Nobel Prize. Race relations are still a dangerous and sensitive subject after all these years especially in light of recent headlines about racial profiling and the riots in Ferguson and other cities. But as vital as it is racial strife is a subject that cries out for a more volatile treatment than this. The Alabama marching sequences and resulting violence filmed in Selma where they actually happened are too understated for my taste. And the home life of King and his vacillating wife Coretta are muted. While he rallied for federal legislation guaranteeing every person in America the right to vote regardless of color he was opposed by the White House and denounced by J. Edgar Hoover and the F.B.I. as a political and moral degenerate. Yet he turned the other cheek until his own people challenged his sincerity. Words from the Bible still dont carry any more weight  today than they did against the whips Remingtons and helicopters that captivated and polarized a nation in the 1960s. Everyone is just too damn polite Still director Ava DuVernay has done a commendable job of enlightening American school kids about a chapter in history theyve both ignored and forgotten. And theres a powerfully nuanced and award-worthy performance by David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King. THE GAMBLER Another wet battery about a week in the life of a gambling addict with a jaundiced-looking Mark Wahlberg as a Los Angeles loser who owes 240000 to various and sundry mobsters illegal gambling rings and bail bondsmen who beat him to bloody hamburger and give him seven days to pay--or end up in the La Brea tar pits. By day hes a failed novelist-turned-associate professor of English Literature by night a hopeless loser who even wipes out his own mother (a hard venomous wasted Jessica Lange) to stake him to another roll of the roulette wheel. This is a remake of a 1974 bomb with James Caan based on a book by James Toback with overtones of Dostoevsy director Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) is too inert and nuance-free to detect. Richard Brooks made a tougher and much better film about the tragedy of compulsive gambling in his 1985 film Fever Pitch and in 1949s The Lady Gambles even Barbara Stanwyck made a more convincing fall from respectability into casino hell than Mark Wahlberg does here. BIG EYES Tim Burtons penchant for the bizarre well serves this odd investigation of the scandal behind the marriage of artist Margaret Keane who created a kitschy world of popular but widely reviled paintings of bereft waifs with huge myopic eyes that sold like proverbial hotcakes (but were far less appetizing) and her ambitious money-hungry and manipulative husband Walter Keane who claimed to be the actual artist using his wifes success to steal the fame and fortune for himself. She was putty in his hands a pushover who went along with his schemes even allowing him to sign his own name to her work until she finally spilled the beans and sued him for slander. Amy Adams stars as Margaret Keane in Big Eyes. After years of bickering and a fair amount of illegitimate larceny the marriage came to a screeching public halt in a courtroom battle where the judge forced the estranged parties to stand before two blank canvases and prove the legitimacy of their claims. (Its the best scene in the picture.) Walter (gregarious Christoph Waltz delightfully oozing insincere charm) died in 2000 broke but still insisting he was no phony. Margaret (Amy Adams unrecognizable in a bottle-blond wig) fled to Hawaii (a perfect place for bad art) opened a new gallery and still paints every day. More subdued than usual Tim Burton presents both a creepy view of a disastrous marriage and an indictment of the tasteless commercial 1950s art scene where goofy fads seduced ignorant collectors into clamoring for ugly ornaments to match their living room walls. Nimble off the beaten track and very entertaining its the cinematic equivalent of a lava lamp. MR. TURNER This film focuses on a different kind of artist--the Victorian radical J.M.W. Turner whose vast spreads of landscapes and sailing ships vanishing into muted mists were largely dismissed in 1845 as a big waste of oil. Queen Victoria thought they were ugly. I agree with Vicky. But this prosaic and vapid bore by long-winded critically overpraised director Mike Leigh is even worse--a vacuous endurance test about an abstract loser struggling for recognition among the Impressionists of his time although we are told he is now considered an Old Master who hangs in museums (the Met owns a few) who influenced Monet and was once defended by Thackeray. He is now defended by movie critics although the reasons are specious--mainly because he is played in this droning yawn by bulbous double-chinned character actor Timothy Spall. Timothy Spall as J.M.W. Turner. The real Turner we are told was a cruel doleful and irritating heel who frittered away his time in seedy brothels insulted the cherished artists of the day and deserted his family leaving them penniless and neglected while he occasionally indulged in bad sex with his pickle-faced hunchback housekeeper. Later he took up with a widowed landlady who rented rooms in the remote port village of Margate where he went to paint whales. With this slow-moving film as evidence--the weirdly overrated equivalent to watching a mud puddle dry--there was nothing remotely interesting about anything he did in life that is worth making a two-hour-plus movie about. Mr. Spall winner of the Cannes and New York Film Critics Circle best-actor awards does his best to bring an unpleasant character to life--grunting and snorting like a boar ready to charge spitting on his canvases and dragging around with a constant wince like a fat baby with colic. With all due respect hes too repulsive to watch for 150 minutes. INTO THE WOODS The new Disney extravaganza Rob Marshall (Chicago) has made of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical is another example of concept over coherence but the entertainment value is considerable. Mr. Sondheim explores the only terrain left to us in which optimism and magic are still possible in a world gone psychotically sour--the landscape of fairy tales. And then he turns enchanted dreams into terrifying nightmares only Freud could understand. Dont take the children. Mr. Marshall uses several interlocking tales to plunge us into the woods of our imagination--three Grimm classics about Cinderella Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk--plus a newly invented one about a childless baker and his wife (James Corden and Emily Blunt) who can lift an evil witchs curse if they can deliver to the old crone Cinderellas slipper Reds red cape and Jacks cow. The witch throws in Rapunzels golden hair too just to make the task more difficult. This first act long but engaging is nothing more than a merry scavenger hunt which also introduces a corny Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp) two handsome mixed-up princes (Chris Pine for Cinderella Billy Magnussen for Rapunzel) Cinderellas wicked stepmother (a hilarious Christine Baranski) and Meryl Streep acting all over the place as the flaky sentimental and always exhausted witch. Their stories intertwine as they trip through an enchanted forest that looks like a thicket of marzipan pretzels. Chris Pine stars as Cinderellas Prince in Into the Woods. Then in Act Two the characters get what the Sondheim-Lapine team thinks they deserve--and nobody lives happily ever after. So its back ""into the woods"" again to confront such jet-age traumas as moral disintegration deception lies betrayal disillusionment fear cowardice regrets doomed relationships failed marriages and death. The woods become such a jumble of gnarled ideas and convoluted metaphors that we quickly lose our way--and our interest. The witch loses her powers Cinderellas prince turns out to be a heel (""I was raised to be charming not sincere"") and the wife of the giant Jack returns to wreak havoc. The point of all this pseudo-intellectual gardening I suppose is to prove that fairy tales do not have happy endings and be careful what you wish for because it might make you miserable. The book is a maze in which there is no door marked ""EXIT"" the best songs like ""Children Will Listen"" and ""You Are Not Alone"" are scattered like bits of dialogue and sound derivative of songs from other Sondheim scores. Still there is much to admire here from the candyfloss costumes to the tricky special effects and the thrill of hearing everyone sing surprisingly well. (Anna Kendrick has a gorgeous soprano and Chris Pine displays wit and a musical range I never thought possible.) I left disenchanted and irritated by so many missed opportunities. Fairy tales do have happy endings despite what Mr. Sondheim might say to the contrary. And there is something wrong with any dramatized fairy tale set to music if when you go away the score is so forgettable that theres nothing to hum but the beanstalk. See you in January.

"Review Selma is a powerful telling of the MLK story - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Selma is a powerful telling of the MLK story Selma Atsushi Nishijima / Paramount Pictures Andre Holland plays Andrew Young left David Oyelowo portrays Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Colman Domingo plays Ralph Abernathy in ""Selma."" Andre Holland plays Andrew Young left David Oyelowo portrays Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Colman Domingo plays Ralph Abernathy in ""Selma."" (Atsushi Nishijima / Paramount Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Review Selma starring David Oyelowo succeeds in big and small ways but falls flat in places ""Selma"" is a necessary film even an essential one with more than its share of memorable performances and vivid compelling sequences.But welcome as it is for being the first Hollywood production to put the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his accomplishments front and center it is also inconsistent and not always as strong as its strongest moments. This may not matter in the grand scheme of things but it is hard to avoid. If there is a temptation to canonize ""Selma"" and brush aside its less successful elements thats not surprising given how good much of it is and the heroic nature of the story not to mention the decades its taken for this history to reach the screen.Oscars 2015 Full coverage Directed with passion and conviction by Ava DuVernay and starring a mesmerizing David Oyelowo as King ""Selma"" relates one of the great American dramas how events in and around a small Alabama city forced this country to live up to its democratic rhetoric and ensure the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Selma trailer Trailer for ""Selma"" directed by Ava DuVernay and starring David Oyelowo. Trailer for ""Selma"" directed by Ava DuVernay and starring David Oyelowo. See more videos Oyelowo whose recent credits include ""Interstellar"" and the forthcoming ""A Most Violent Year"" met DuVernay when he starred in her moving and accomplished ""Middle of Nowhere"" and his support was key in getting the director this job.DuVernays intimate style helps in her successful attempt to humanize King his wife Coretta Scott King (a deft Carmen Ejogo) and his circle of advisers and comrades in arms to see them not as monumental icons but rather real people with personal lives and problems. Given what they accomplished ""Selma"" cant help but mythologize this group as well but it is a low-key mythologization rather than the bombastic sort. This technique works best with King and his wife in part because of what the actors bring to the table. Oyelowo has felt driven to play the civil rights leader for years and how expertly he has captured the body language and the cadences of Kings delivery is even more remarkable when you realize that copyright issues mandated that the speeches he delivers are not word for word accurate but only reasonable facsimiles of the real thing. Ejogo especially strong in the scenes that reveal the strains and tensions in the King marriage also has a history with her role having played Scott King in the 2001 HBO movie ""Boycott"" about the Montgomery Ala. bus boycotts a decade earlier.As written by Paul Webb ""Selma"" starts with just such an intimate moment with King practicing his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in a Stockholm hotel room while his wife helps him with an unfamiliar ascot and he worries about living too high on the hog.DuVernay is equally good at conveying the sense of camaraderie the civil rights movement could not have existed without. Helped by Bradford Youngs clear-eyed cinematography and Aicha Coleys spot-on casting this is especially visible in an early scene of a warm convivial luncheon of leaders of Kings Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Its an ability to convey the black experience that brings to mind such fine Charles Burnett films as ""Nightjohn"" and the masterful ""To Sleep With Anger.""After the Nobel compelled by the near-impossibility of black people registering to vote (something we see firsthand with Oprah Winfrey as a would-be voter) King decides this is an issue that cannot wait.That puts him on a collision course with President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) who thinks the war on poverty should be more of a priority. ""This voting thing is just going to have to wait"" he tells King but presidential support or not King is not to be put off.Selma we come to understand was hardly picked at random. Not only were the statistics especially grim -- a 50% African American population who made up only 2% of voters -- but the state courthouse was an especially camera-ready target and the local county Sheriff Jim Clark was racist enough to be a tempting adversary. In fact one of the themes of ""Selma"" is how tactical so much was how geared to getting on the network news and influencing public opinion nationwide.That doesnt mean anything was easy. Far from it. As on-screen type from FBI logs indicates the bureau followed King everywhere and he and his wife were plagued by abusive anonymous phone messages. And King had to deal with rifts within the civil rights movement specifically with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) which had been organizing in Selma before his people arrived.The heart of ""Selma"" is the three separate 50-mile marches attempted by the movement from Selma across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to Alabamas capital of Montgomery. Each had a different character each is choreographed to different music. But it is the first one when the marchers were met with horrific violence that makes the most disturbing impression.Yet as well done as much of ""Selma"" is it periodically falls from grace with moments that are either emotionally flat or excessively agitprop in nature. Consistently the most ineffective scenes are those that involve powerful but obstructionist white people especially the unhelpful trio of Johnson Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker). The deftness with acting and character that can be this films strength simply deserts it here.But ""Selma"" never loses its ability to be powerful when it needs to be and the film gets frequent infusions of momentum from its big emotional scenes like the murder of activist Jimmie Lee Jackson (Fred Stanfield). Even if you cant ignore the elements that do not work on screen you can be grateful that this momentous chapter in American history has been filmed at last.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------SelmaMPAA rating PG-13 for disturbing thematic material including violence a suggestive moment and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesPlaying In limited release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Martin Luther King Jr. Selma Ava DuVernay David Oyelowo In Selma David Oyelowo digs deep to play Martin Luther King Jr. Director Ava DuVernay populates Selma with real people and events Cheat sheet Get to know the 2015 Oscar nominees Oscar Watch Selma scores with academy Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-selma-review-20141225-column.html,200,selma26,selma,latimes

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday December 23 2014 Follow AnnHornaday One of the most vexing facts of cinematic life the past 50 years is that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement he led have not been given their rightful place in the feature-film canon. Often relegated to the shadows of ancillary plots atmospheric background and blurry historical context what were arguably the most pivotal events in American life during the 20th century never found their rightful place -- front center and spotlit -- in the dominant narrative art form of that era. Until now. And it was worth the wait. With ""Selma"" director Ava DuVernay has created a stirring often thrilling uncannily timely drama that works on several levels at once. Yes its an impressive historic pageant and one that will no doubt break the ice for similar-themed movies to come. But DuVernay whose roots are in the indie world having directed the films ""I Will Follow"" and ""Middle of Nowhere"" has also rescued King from his role as a worshiped -- and sentimentalized -- secular saint. Here she presents him as a dynamic figure of human-scale contradictions flaws and supremely shrewd political skills. Indeed the most riveting passages of ""Selma"" which chronicles three marches King planned and finally led from Selma to Montgomery Ala. in 1965 arent the speeches and ground-level skirmishes that led up to the marches. Rather the most pulse-quickening material can be found in the meetings between King (David Oyelowo) and President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) as they argued the issue of voting rights. Early in ""Selma"" King travels to the White House to implore the president to pass a voting rights bill while a weary LBJ -- who had signed the Civil Rights Act just a year before -- asks King to be patient and support his War on Poverty in the meantime. Watching these redoubtable figures spar cajole strong-arm and size each other up winds up being enormously entertaining. Much like the backroom machinations that propelled Steven Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" Kings push-me-pull-you pas de deux with Johnson reveals talents as a political operator that were every bit as spectacular as his soaring oratory. 1 of 62 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Four-star movies View Photos Keep tabs on the films that received top honors from Post critics over the last year.

Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Anyone who is familiar with those speeches will realize that theyre not reproduced note-for-note in ""Selma"" which was written by Paul Webb. The filmmakers didnt have access to the rights to Kings speeches so in a brilliant work-around DuVernay approximates his words allowing viewers to focus on their meaning rather than on how literally Oyelowo reproduces them. For his part Oyelowo doesnt mimic King so much as channel him His voice devoid of Kings familiar church-bell timbre is his own and he has used it to create a bona fide character rather than a superficial impersonation. Exquisitely shot by cinematographer Bradford Young ""Selma"" plunges the audience into 1960s Alabama where we see Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey who also helped produce) try once again to register to vote. Shes prepared when the registrar demands that she recite the preamble to the U.S. Constitution and she even knows how many county judges reside in Alabama. Asked to name them however she falters. Later Cooper would figure prominently in Kings strategy of drawing attention to the fight he led against injustice and racism; among the many things ""Selma"" does brilliantly is giving the lie to nonviolence as a merely passive benign form of protest. Instead we see King using it not just as a moral force but also as a battle of images in which searing footage and photographs of protesters being brutalized by local terrorists and law enforcement officials would with luck electrify the nation in support of his cause. Like any historical drama ""Selma"" contains its share of compressions and the stiff declarative rhythms of ""important"" billboard scenes. But for the most part DuVernay makes sweeping smooth work of a challenging collection of events which spanned the murder of a young marcher named Jimmie Lee Jackson; White House huddles with King and Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth); the savage beatings of Annie Lee Cooper and a Boston clergyman named James Reeb; Kings imprisonment with fellow civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy; the arrival on the scene of Malcolm X; a tense conversation between King and his wife Coretta (beautifully played by Carmen Ejogo); arguments between King the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; a court case countermanding Wallaces order to stop the march; and finally the three demonstrations that culminated in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. DuVernay stages all of this with economy grace and skillful authoritative aplomb. ""Selma"" carries viewers along on a tide of breathtaking events so assuredly that they never drown in the details or the despair but instead are left buoyed The civil rights movement and its heroes arent artifacts from the distant past but messengers sent on an urgent mission for today. There are several reasons to see ""Selma"" -- for its virtuosity and scale scope and sheer beauty. But then there are its lessons which have to do with history but also today ""Selma"" invites viewers to heed its story meditate on its implications and allow those images once again to change our hearts and minds.

Martin Luther King Jr. in ""Selma"" based on the history-changing civil rights marches of the 60s. Photo Credit Atsushi Nishijima advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The story of the 1965 voting rights marches led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE An insightful look into the making of a historic moment; Oyelowo raises the roof as MLK. CAST David Oyelowo Carmen Ejogo Tom Wilkinson LENGTH 207 A rriving in the Alabama town that gives the movie ""Selma"" its name the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. seems uncertain whether hes picked the right place to launch a headline-grabbing campaign for black voting rights. Folks seem nice enough until a white man steps out of the crowd and greets King with a hard right to the jaw. ""This place"" King says getting to his feet ""is perfect."" advertisement | advertise on newsday The great David Oyelowo plays King in ""Selma"" but the movie is less about the leader than the movement he created and his galvanizing voting-rights marches from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. Densely packed with information and brought to life by a score of fine performances its the rare historical drama that feels urgent and relevant. The movie reminds us in a prescient scene that the marches began after local police shot and killed an unarmed black man Jimmie Lee Jackson (Keith Stanfield). ""Selma"" puts us right in the middle of Kings inner circle taking us with him everywhere he goes. We see him wrangling with President Lyndon Johnson (a terrific Tom Wilkinson) struggling to keep his marriage together (Carmen Ejogo plays Coretta Scott King) and trying to appease members of the like-minded but territorial Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. Ava DuVernay directs with great attention to detail especially during the standoffs with state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge; Paul Webbs economical script helps keeps the pace crisp. Oyelowos King can feel a little lugubrious. He is tired and a cloud of doom hangs over him. Once he gets on a platform though look out. Oyelowo theatrically trained with a background in Shakespeare captures not just Kings resonant voice but his passion and moral conviction. Youd follow this man anywhere. 232 MoviesSelma trailer Even the smallest roles in ""Selma"" are important including activist Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) intransigent Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) and a steely J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker) whose surveillance logs of Kings activities frequently appear on screen. The films yearbook ending describing the fates of real people we hardly knew speaks to the sacrifices made on behalf of an ideal. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Selma"" could well go down as one of the definitive dramas of the civil rights movement. Its a powerful reminder of what was accomplished and what remains to be done.

Rated PG-13 (violence). At the Lincoln Square the Union Square others. Brilliantly acted and directed Ava DuVernays towering ""Selma"" is Hollywoods definitive depiction of the 1960s American civil rights movement -- as well as perhaps the most timely movie youll see this year. It focuses with vivid dramatic strength on the demonstrations -- and political maneuvering between Martin Luther King Jr. and President Lyndon B. Johnson -- that led to the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act which half a century later is under attack in various states even as police killings in Ferguson and Staten Island have triggered nationwide protests. British actor David Oyelowo is superb as King who in 1964 is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize a reception that DuVernay and screenwriter Paul Webb effectively juxtapose with a church bombing by white supremacists that killed four black girls in Birmingham Ala. the year before. Johnson (a fine Tom Wilkinson) had used his political wiles to shepherd the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 through Congress and signed it into law. But his sometimes-ally King knows the president will need to be publicly shamed into tackling the Jim Crow laws that make it virtually impossible for blacks to vote in much of the South. The high-profile battleground that King chooses for his nonviolent protests is Selma Ala. where he plots a voting-rights march to the state capitol in Montgomery. Its a perilous undertaking in which Kings allies -- including many whites -- risk their lives at the hands of racists determined to stop the march by any means necessary. From left Tessa Thompson as Diane Nash Omar Dorsey as James Orange Colman Domingo as Ralph Abernathy David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King Jr.Andre Holland as Andrew Young and Corey Reynolds as Rev. C.T. Vivian.Photo Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures The movies big dramatic confrontations -- filmed at the actual location -- come during marchers attempts to cross Selmas Edmund Pettus Bridge. The first time they are violently turned back by Selma police on what becomes known as Bloody Sunday. By the successful third try the entire world is watching Alabama and Johnson has deployed troops so King can deliver one of his most famous speeches in Montgomery. Its these scenes that allow ""Selma"" to surpass the recent American film it most closely resembles Stephen Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" which kept the subjects of that earlier presidents struggle against slavery off-camera for much of its running time. DuVernay -- who will almost certainly become the first African-American woman nominated for the Best Director Oscar -- also does a better (and less long-winded) job of depicting the political process. Another valid point of comparison would be to last years ""Lee Daniels The Butler a pseudo-biopic featuring some of the same actors including Oprah Winfrey (who has producer credits on both films). Over the top in the earlier film a more effectively restrained Winfrey has a small but important role as a hospice nurse who becomes caught up in the Selma struggle. Oprah Winfrey in ""Selma""Photo Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures There are also fine performances by Carmen Ejogo as neglected wife Coretta Scott King; Nigel Thatch as Malcolm X representing the fiery alternative to Kings nonviolence; Tim Roth as Alabama Gov. George Wallace; Cuba Gooding Jr. as civil rights attorney Fred Gray; and Martin Sheen as a federal judge who makes a key ruling. Evocatively photographed by Bradford Young ""Selma"" is dominated by Oyelowo who impressed as Forest Whitakers Freedom Rider-turned-Black Panther son in ""The Butler. Here Oyelowo gets deep into the skin of the central character a brilliant strategist haunted by what he terms ""the constant closeness of death.

Theres nothing ""finished"" about the issue of American racism and fittingly Selma unlike so many great-man biopics lures us into a crucible of unsettled arguments and shifting strategies as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s landmark 1965 Alabama march becomes a reality--at a terrible cost. The film plays like a better episode of Mad Men pitch-perfect in its details yet fully lived-in a universe of rolled-up shirt sleeves sweat-laden brows and screams that dont sound canned. Meticulously researched and elegantly scripted by debuting screenwriter Paul Webb Selma toggles between moments big and small though everything feels necessary. The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963 an act of homegrown terrorism largely responsible for the drive to action isnt announced so much as eased into as four impeccably dressed girls descend a stairway chatting about hairdos. We see King (David Oyelowo) grousing about his fancy tie; attended to by a soothing wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo); and trotted out to accept his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. His work is far from done Even as his team makes its way down to Alabama to set up headquarters Kings reputation precedes him as does a punch in the face in the hotel lobby. Selma truly takes off though in its wonky instances of back-and-forth Oyelowo brings massive conviction to the rousing sermons (bound to electrify the crowd youre in) but is even better in his quieter moments insisting to worried activists on the need for ""drama."" The game plan for a 54-mile march through scary backwoods develops over scenes as does an equally riveting bit of gamesmanship between LBJ (Tom Wilkinson) and racist Alabama governor George Wallace (Tim Roth transfixing) roughing out a profane bit of compromise thats almost shocking in its pragmatism. Complex performances dominate the film playing against the emotional bombast of an Oliver Stone epic. But DuVernays main achievement is her creation of a mental and geographical state of unrest of stifling heat prison-cell doubts and spattered blood. Go now.

The killing of Michael Brown Eric Garner and Tamir Rice at the hands of police officers -- not to mention the Supreme Courts dismantling in June 2013 of the Voting Rights Act a quieter yet perhaps more insidious event -- all indicate that the Civil Rights Era is ongoing because it has to be. Selma in addition to being a meticulously detailed historical drama is the right movie for the moment In telling the story of the three marches -- from Selma to Montgomery Alabama -- led by Martin Luther King in 1965 as a protest against restrictions that prevented African Americans from registering to vote DuVernay has also opened a window of hope on the present. If change was painful then we shouldnt expect it to be easy now. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Change always costs us something and DuVernay -- working from a script by Paul Webb -- faces that truth unflinchingly. The film opens with King played by David Oyelowo fussing with the ascot hes supposed to wear to accept the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize; he complains to wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) that its just too pretentious that his friends back home would mock him for ""living high on the hog."" But his mind is really on something much more pressing than the propriety of this length of silk and at this point DuVernay dramatizes a key event that haunts the speech hes about to give a tragedy that had occurred a year earlier A cluster of little girls descend a church stairwell chattering about the best ways to get straight beautiful hair. Theyre wearing dresses with short bouffant skirts and gloves with lacy cuffs; they carry tiny Sunday purses barely big enough for a hankie and a few pennies.The explosion that kills them is in the hands of DuVernay and cinematographer Bradford Young a slow-motion swirl of dust and splinters and shards of glass. We also get a glimpse of one small airborne patent-leather shoe. The violence of the moment may be too muted for some and too heartstring-plucking for others. But what else could she do with one of the most villainous and godless acts of the last half of the 20th century the murder of four girls at the hands of white supremacists in a Birmingham church in 1963? DuVernay gets the moment as right as anyone could. If it knocks the wind out of you that means youre still breathing.Film DetailsCritics Pick Selma RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time127 min. More Info Trailer With Selma DuVernay has pulled off a tricky feat a movie based on historical events that never feels dull worthy or lifeless; it hangs together as a story and not just part of a lesson plan. The movie is at once intimate and grand in scope An early scene shows Annie Lee Cooper (played by Oprah Winfrey) who would become a voting rights activist trying to register in her home county and being turned away stymied by a blockade of absurd regulations. Another shows King in the Oval Office conferring with Lyndon B. Johnson (played by a superb Tom Wilkinson who gets even the hunch of Johnsons shoulders just right) urging the president to push forward with the Voting Rights Act. LBJ having succeeded the previous year in the gargantuan task of pushing the Civil Rights Act through Congress drags his heels. Johnson knows how much he needs King politically but hes not above using his power in devious ways In one subtle and chilling scene he gives FBI honcho J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker who manages to come off as both parched and oily) tacit permission to try to break up the King household as a way of undermining the movement.LBJ eventually ended up on the right side of history but King had to nudge him toward it. King also had to negotiate disputes between the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee two groups with similar goals but bitter differences about how to reach them. (Stephan James is marvelous as the young John Lewis the SNCC activist who would become a Georgia congressman now in office for 28 years and referred to by his colleagues as ""the conscience of Congress."")Selma lays out the challenges faced by organizers and regular citizens alike in planning and executing the marches. On their first attempt to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge theyre run down and clubbed by Sheriff Jim Clark and a phalanx of policemen on horseback; the cops descend upon the peaceful marchers many of them elderly kicking and beating them with batons. DuVernay proves both discreet and vigorous in her orchestration of violence emphasizing its horror without beating the audience up.Shes similarly judicious in depicting the shooting death of activist Jimmie Lee Jackson (Keith Stanfield) again at the hands of policemen and the beating death of James Reeb (Jeremy Strong) the minister who came down from Boston to join the march and was killed by white supremacists. Theres nothing graphic in Selma but you feel the weight of every act.DuVernay -- whose previous features include the 2012 drama Middle of Nowhere -- has put together an exceptionally fine ensembles of actors among them Common (as SCLC activist James Bevel) Tessa Thompson (as in FBI parlance ""female agitator"" Diane Nash) and Tim Roth (who makes a wheedling weaselly George Wallace). Ejogo brings fine gradient shading to the role of Coretta Scott King. More than just a put-upon wife shes a woman who looks at her husband every day -- a great man and a flawed human being -- and wonders when not if hes going to be taken away from her.As King Oyelowo is the movies grave but radiant center. DuVernay isnt afraid to tangle with some of the thornier issues of Kings legacy Though he advocated only peaceful protest he was canny enough to know that provoking his opponents into violence was the surest way to draw attention to the cause. Oyelowo plays King as a man who knew what he was risking every day -- not just his own life but the lives of others. In one of the movies quietest most piercing moments he calls a friend in the middle of the night. She rolls out of bed to answer the phone. ""I just need to hear the Lords voice"" King tells the woman who turns out to be Mahalia Jackson (played by Ledisi Young). She obliges with an impromptu version of ""Take My Hand Precious Lord."" Selma shows King in moments of weakness and triumph and though it stops well short of portraying him as saintly hes still a hero for our time. In the past year as Americans weve had too many occasions to look at ourselves and realize we dont know who we are anymore. Selma reminds us were capable of better.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Whats more depressing than the fact that it took Hollywood half a century to make a major motion picture about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.? How about that the film that finally has been made about him is being released into a new America that looks not so radically different from the old America it depicts? Long before the end credits when a song by Common and John Legend makes explicit the contemporary parallels Selma bears the burden of current events--which is to say its impossible to look at images of white lawmen coming down hard on unarmed black civilians and to think only of yesterdays struggles. The topicality would be an awful accident if what happened in Ferguson and Sanford werent symptomatic of a bigger problem in this country one that didnt end with the life of the civil rights movements most prominent leader. As cinema Selma is commendable; as cultural barometer its beyond reproach.But about the film as cinema Less an MLK biopic than a kind of procedural on the mans grassroots methods Selma benefits from seizing on a very specific historical moment. Instead of offering a summation of their subjects life and legacy director Ava DuVernay and writer Paul Webb plunk us down in the early weeks of 1965 after the march on Washington and ""I Have A Dream."" By this time King (David Oyelowo) is already a figure of great visibility and influence one who understands that his presence brings with it the eyes of the world. Per its title the film concerns Kings arrival in Selma Alabama where he mobilizes the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to assist in the voting rights movement already in progress. ""It cant wait"" he tells Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) when the president asks him to sit on the issue; as King reasons the safety of black citizens in the South is directly related to their ability to vote racist white politicians out of office.Earlier drafts of Webbs script allegedly created a equilibrium between King and Johnson even going as far as viewing many of the events through the latters eyes. Smartly and crucially Selma has been reconfigured This is Kings story or the story of his movement anyway; Johnson is depicted as a man with his own agenda forced against his will to get on the right side of history. That makes the film a corrective to portraits of LBJ as the proud benevolent architect of the Voting Rights Act. It also makes Selma the rare studio movie about black American history to not focus on (or invent) a white savior figure. The major Caucasian characters in the film are almost all forces of opposition Tim Roth plays bigoted governor George Wallace as a weak man raging pitifully against progress while Dylan Baker brings a perfect squareness to J. Edgar Hoover assigned by Johnson to spy on and possibly discredit King. (In one of the films most eccentric stylistic choices important dates are announced using the superimposed surveillance notes of the FBI--another scary echo of our current NSA-monitored age.)At its most interesting Selma gets into the nitty-gritty of organized action making audiences privy to sometimes heated backroom discussions. Dr. Kings reputation as a virtuous effective leader is so secure today that its bracing to see his ideas challenged on screen--by a young John Lewis (Stephan James) whose Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee fought for voter rights years before SCLC arrived in Selma and by Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch) weeks before he was assassinated. What emerges at center is a vision of King as a savvy strategist not a noble saint; theres a fascinating tension between his nonviolent tactics informed by his faith and his understanding that violence when perpetrated by the other side and caught on camera can be a powerful motivator.Carrying around a few extra pounds and sporting some iconic facial hair Oyelowo toes the line between embodiment and impression. The opening scene slyly foregrounds the duality of the role Dr. King delivers some passionate words straight into the camera then ""breaks character"" to complain about his attire; he is rehearsing an upcoming speech. Selma sees its subject as an ordinary level-headed man entrusted with the responsibility to make himself extraordinary as part of the ""performance"" of leadership. But Oyelowo nails only half of that equation. The lack of licensed King speeches is a blessing in disguise; in the few moments that he does take the stage the actor cant quite match the oratorical fervor of the famous leader hes playing perhaps because real footage of his fiery addresses is so readily available. Oyelowo fares better when illuminating the less public side of King as in the wrenching scene when his wife Coretta Scott (Carmen Ejogo) confronts him about his infidelities.In general Selma is much stronger when staying off the pulpit. Two-person conversations occasionally stray into speechifying which is one of a few ways that the film adheres to the conventions of the common prestige picture. DuVernay is terrific with her actors and smartly enlisted the services of cinematographer Bradford Young (Pariah Aint Them Bodies Saints) who gives the material a handsome sheen without making it look too museum-exhibit slick. Too often however do the directors visual choices shade into bombast; her use of dramatic slow-motion for scenes of violence--most notably during the films ""Bloody Sunday"" sequence--dampens the sickening power of that imagery. Wouldnt it be better to stage such material starkly to allow the audience to see it as America did on its television sets? Though an inferior film in most other respects Lee Daniels The Butler handled the horrors of the 1960s South more effectively--namely by staring the hate and ugliness right in the face.Nothing if not ambitious Selma attempts to nest a small-scale character study into a larger survey of Kings efforts in Alabama and at the White House. The balancing act isnt always successful By the end as the marches have begun in earnest Oyelowo starts to be swallowed up by the iconography of the events the film running out of room for nuances of character. But Selma never quite goes hagiographic nor does it lose its sense of urgency. Avoiding flashbacks to her subjects younger years and resisting the urge to cut ahead to his tragic death DuVernay sticks to her three-month timeline. This creates a present tense that most biographical period pieces lack--and by depicting neither the beginning nor the abrupt end of Kings crusade the film implies that his dream for the country remains a work in progress. Put another way The fight for black lives in America goes on with Dr. King still there in spirit on the frontlines.

The bombing in Birmingham? Thats mentioned here. The Montgomery bus boycott? Alluded to. Martin Luther Kings constant pressure on Washington to act? Visited again and again. But that is not obviously the real heart of ""Selma."" Instead Ava DuVernays ambitious film headquarters itself in mid-`60s Alabama where Gov. George Wallace reigns and black people are still routinely denied the right to vote. It is where King goes for his next great battle. And it is where the ugliness of the forces arrayed against him will once again be shown on the nations front pages and in brutal coast-to-coast closeup. At first Paul Webbs script skitters about a bit -- a scene at the Nobel gala a scene in Birmingham a scene as Oprah Winfrey (also one of the films producers) tries vainly to register to vote. But then King gets to Alabama and the march for justice -- first metaphorically then literally -- begins. All the leads are oddly British and accomplished as they are a number fall a bit short vocally and physically. If we werent told Tom Wilkinson was playing LBJ that Tim Roth were appearing as Wallace wed have no reason to suspect it. Theyre not right physically and their accents are mere approximations. Yet although David Oyelowo doesnt quite have Kings resonant baritone he does have the passion of the mans ideals and his great preternaturally dignified bearing. (It is still easy to forget that King had been on the national stage since he was in his mid-20s.) He is not a perfect man and the film acknowledges those flaws as he fails to keep vows to his wife (and some followers feel to them). But he is a true leader and -- unlike say the Moses of ""Exodus Gods and Kings."" He is not just the figurehead of a movement. He embodies movement itself ever forward never stopping. And Oyelowo is well partnered by Carmen Ejogo as the elegant but steel-spined Coretta Scott King and by an army of colleagues that includes supporting players Common Lorraine Toussaint and Cuba Gooding Jr. (A cameo by that old liberal Martin Sheen too who never met a progressive project he couldnt devote a day to.) There is little fancy filmmaking here. When the violence comes it is fast; the reactions are often in slow motion as people scream fall bounce off the pavement. But mostly this has the straightforward no-nonsense look of a basic-cable project. Occasionally the rough economics of the production are especially apparent as we see the same few locations photographed in the same artfully concealing angles. Yet sometimes there is a virtue to that economy. No the film does not fully restage the final dramatic march to the Alabama statehouse. But its switch to actual newsreel footage rather than coming off as a cheat is incredibly moving. This is real American history being made you think -- and regular Americans making it. But then those are the Americans who always do. Ratings note The film contains strong language and violence. Selma (PG-13) Paramount (122 min.) Directed by Ava DuVernay. With David Oyelowo Carmen Ejogo. Now playing in New York.",http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/12/selma_review_the_march_that_began_with_a_single_step.html,200,selma34,selma,nj

DuVernay working from a terrific tightly focused script by Paul Webb blows the dust off history to find its beating heart. Look at the situation facing King played magnificently by British actor David Oyelowo Black voters in the South are being intimidated beaten and disenfranchised. Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) likes it the Jim Crow way. In the White House Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) hems and haws. King had to take action. He thought a nonviolent march in Selma where bigotry was on full boil would create a media firestorm and force the presidents hand. King was right. But at considerable cost. Within the civil rights movement the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee resented his intrusion. King expected push-back from proponents of violent action. But in a meeting between Malcolm X (a splendid Nigel Thatch) and Kings wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) a more surprising strategy emerges. Political gamesmanship is at play and DuVernay shows how every hand gets dirty. There are no halos in DuVernays film and that extends to King. Selma isnt a biopic - it celebrates community action - but in seeing King through the prism of one crucial event the film offers a rousing portrait of a born preacher not without sin. Oyelowos stirring soulful performance deserves superlatives. His delivery of Kings speeches especially ""How Long Not Long"" rings with emotion. But its in quiet moments of humor heartbreak and stabbing self-doubt that we see a man in full. King and his wife discuss his infidelities with a wrenching honesty that cuts deep. Ejogos work is also ardent and award-caliber. Its ironic that Ejogo and Oyelowo are British as are Wilkinson and Roth but why grouse when acting is this artful? On March 7th ""Bloody Sunday"" black and white marchers are forced to turn back on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in the face of police billy clubs. Later a judge forces a truce and the march proceeds. DuVernay and the gifted cinematographer Bradford Young shooting in Alabama achieve visceral wonders as we watch history forged in flesh and blood. A word here about the real women behind the Selma march. Oprah Winfrey one of the films producers is deeply moving as Annie Lee Cooper a nurse who decked a white sheriff for denying her right to vote. Lorraine Toussaint excels as Amelia Boynton who is brutally pummeled on the march and so does Tessa Thompson as Diane Nash an unsung hero of the movement. Still the woman of these two blistering hours is DuVernay 42 a former publicist for the likes of Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood. Her second feature 2012s Middle of Nowhere made her the first African-American woman to win the Sundance award for directing. In Selma DuVernays talent is in full blaze. The sprawl of an event that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Bill in August 1965 is uncontainable especially in one film. But nothing is going to stop DuVernay. In ""Glory"" a song by Common and John Legend that ends the film we hear the lyric ""Thats why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up. . . ./They say Stay down and we stand up."" DuVernays momentous film is a testament to those words. The struggle continues. Topics Oprah Winfrey Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

(Photo credit Atsushi Nishijima/Atsushi Nishijima) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday December 23 2014 200 AM Title Selma Film Info With David Oyelowo Tom Wilkinson Martin Luther King Jr. fights for voting rights. Director Ava DuVernay (208) PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. Opens Thursday. Until now no feature film has been made about Martin Luther King Jr. Whether thats because the slain civil rights leaders story was too sprawling or because some his most important speeches cant be recreated because of legalities the closest Hollywood has come is a 1978 TV movie. Which is one reason ""Selma"" surprises. Heres another Director Ava DuVernay and writer Paul Webb focus on Kings 1965 battle for voting rights and his political pressure on President Lyndon Johnson to end the systemic oppression of black Americans. This is an intellectual approach to an emotional issue -- and it delivers powerfully and beautifully. The film opens with a tableau of the eras struggle horror and headlines Little girls are victims of a church bombing. Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey) is asked impossible questions before being told she cannot register to vote. And King (David Oyelowo) still just an Atlanta minister at heart is in Sweden with his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) to receive the Nobel Prize. When he returns to the U.S. King urges Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to pass voting rights a bedrock of equality. A major hurdle is Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) and his Alabama state troopers who enforce the racism Wallace embodies. That helps make Selma the perfect place to start. King encounters resistance also from Selmas Southern Christian Leadership Conference which he helped found and whose leaders have other plans. Finally King and his team -- including Andrew Young (Andre Holland) Amelia Boynton (Lorraine Toussaint) and James Bevel (Common) -- decide a march is the best means to their goal of making America wake up. That it does and Johnson is forced to take action after 1965s Bloody Sunday on March 7 when peaceful marchers are inhumanly beaten by Alabama troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. DuVernay a nuanced indie filmmaker making her first big studio film gracefully shows the strategies negotiations and meetings that made a dream possible. If were never quite inside Kings head we are absolutely right beside him as the weight of history and the hope of good people falls on him. Oyelowo embodies King with a soft-spoken urgency and sad-eyed determination. Talking to Wilkinsons growly LBJ King is never less than a leader while assuring the president that nonviolence travels with this movement. Roth Winfrey and Ejogo are all standouts in supporting roles. Cinematographer Bradford Young --  who shot ""Aint Them Bodies Saints"" and DuVernays ""Middle of Nowhere"" --  films ""Selma"" in honeyed hues that make it feel both immediate and historic. That also sums up the reality of the world surrounding this terrific movies release. The battle it documents is both a cornerstone of the past and a reflection of ongoing struggles. DuVernay infuses ""Selma"" with that dichotomy never forgetting how Selma the place was a pledge to march ahead. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

"Martin Luther King film Selma reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Selma Will Make You Sad Then Make You Mad Then Inspire You Selma Will Make You Sad Then Make You Mad Then Inspire You Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 19 2014 1203 PM Selma Ava DuVernays moving inspiring film about Martin Luther King and the struggle for the Voting Rights Act. By Dana Stevens David Oyelowo (center) as Martin Luther King in Selma. Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures via IMDB Theres a reason Ava DuVernays sober and moving account of the months between the 1963 bombing of a Birmingham church by white supremacists and Congress 1965 passage of the Voting Rights Act is titled Selma and not say Dr. King. DuVernays film which opens in limited release Christmas Day doesnt attempt to be a biopic about the towering historical figure at its center the Rev. Martin Luther King whos played with quiet authority by the magnificent British actor David Oyelowo. Selma isnt the story of a man but of a movement and of a very specific turning point within that movement. Youll see few of the famous touchstones of Kings short life here no March on Washington (and hence no ""I have a dream"" speech); no composition of the letter from the Birmingham jail; no assassination on a motel balcony in Memphis. Selma limits its scope to a few key months of protest struggle and strategy within the civil rights movement--a decision which allows DuVernay to explore the ideas (and sometimes the rancorous debates) that drove the movement forward rather than simply to re-enact its moments of greatest triumph. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The films opening scenes juxtapose Kings acceptance speech at a Nobel Peace Prize ceremony with the apparently peaceful image of four young black girls decked in their frilly Sunday best descending the staircase of a church. As they chatter about friends and hairdos the audience with the hindsight of history senses with mounting dread whats about to befall them. One deafening blast later the childrens limbs are barely visible beneath a pile of lumber and rubble as shards of debris and scraps of lacy fabric drift down in the air above them like snow. By beginning her movie with this unflinching re-enactment of a particularly vile act of racial terrorism--filmed in a style thats poetic rather than graphic but thats no less wrenching for that--DuVernay immediately lays out the stark moral stakes of the political fight to come. The battleground shifts slightly in the next scene when a working-class black woman Annie Lee Cooper (played with surprising naturalism by Oprah Winfrey one of the countrys richest and most powerful people) attempts unsuccessfully to register to vote in an Alabama courthouse where knowing the entire preamble to the Constitution by heart is somehow not enough to convince the white clerk of her qualification to cast a ballot. The protest scenes in Selma are like scenes from a war movie. Advertisement A few months before the films main action begins President Lyndon Johnson (a credibly glad-handing Tom Wilkinson) has managed to strong-arm Congress into passing the Civil Rights Act making it illegal to segregate public facilities by race. But as King points out during a visit to the president--in which their respectful but openly confrontational dialogue makes it clear these two savvy negotiators have a history of brokering deals--the right to vote is worth little without a legal infrastructure that would enable people of color to actually get anywhere near a polling booth. Johnson prefers to shift his administrations legislative focus to other issues including a nationwide war on poverty but King begs him to first push through a federal fix for the loopholes that allow racist politicians in the South to effectively disenfranchise black people en masse. The rest of the film is built around three big protest marches that set out from Selma for the capitol building in Montgomery. (Not all of them make it there for reasons Ill leave you to discover if youre not familiar with the seldom-retold backstory of this historical event.) Kings strategy--one thats occasionally challenged by his fellow activists including two hotheaded young members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee James Forman (Trai Byers) and John Lewis (Stephan James)--is to stage acts of nonviolent resistance in front of as many reporters and TV cameras as possible. Knowing that the Jim Crow government of Gov. George Wallace (a sly unctuous Tim Roth) will put up a big ugly fight King aims to make state-sanctioned police brutality the top news story every night. That way he reasons he can force LBJs hand into taking action at the federal level. All of Kings shrewd tactics give way to anguished self-doubt however when he finds himself in the streets of the capital with the safety of thousands of fellow citizens weighing on his conscience. In a demonstration where even peaceful protesters (elderly women not excluded) are at risk of being beaten by nightsticks you dont want to know what happens to the occasional marcher who loses his or her patience with the whole ""nonviolent protest"" model and starts to give the rampaging cops what-for. The protest scenes in Selma convey in a grounded and visceral way what its like to engage in collective action to put ones body and physical safety on the line for a cause. Theyre not mocked up to resemble old news footage or cut together in choppy hand-held style. Theyre more like scenes from a war movie with violent events unfolding in the moment and previously minor characters emerging into relief through unexpected acts of courage cowardice or generosity. Winfrey whose acting career is becoming a thing to reckon with gets a memorable encounter with a brutish officer on the steps of the capitol. But Selma isnt all backroom horse trading and grand-scale political action. DuVernay also drills into Kings intimate if rocky partnership with his wife Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo). The politically savvy Coretta is her husbands closest confidante and his advisor on everything from tactics to tie tacks. But shes also acutely aware that hes been cheating on her for years with a string of mistresses--a fact the movie introduces in dramatic fashion when the FBI (led by Dylan Bakers J. Edgar Hoover) sends Coretta a tape of her husband having loud vocal sex with another woman. In an emotionally grueling scene Coretta forces her husband to listen to the tape in her presence hovering above him as he sits paralyzed with fear and shame. Her chilly response to his fumbling attempt at denial is as irrefutable as it is devastating ""I know ... I know what you sound like."" Top Comment Because of Dr. Kings honorable actions the voting rights of minorities were protected in this country from 1965 all to way until 2013 when the Supreme Court overruled it.  More... -Reminiscent of a bee Join In There are elements of Selma (which was written by first-time screenwriter Paul Webb with some uncredited rewrites from DuVernay) that could have been more fully fleshed out. The films running time is a swift two hours; I wouldnt have minded an extra 30 minutes to learn more about the rest of the civil rights pioneers (all real historical figures) who march arm-in-arm on the front lines with King including Wendell Pierces Reverend Hosea Williams and Tessa Thompsons Diane Nash. And a rushed ending montage about the eventual passage of the Voting Rights Act threatens to slip into the tone of nonspecific historical uplift that the film otherwise so successfully avoids. But by focusing on the power of cannily staged collective action to turn the tide of public opinion Selma achieves a contemporary relevance that few historical dramas can--especially those built around real-life figures as encrusted in layers of hagiography as MLK. Then theres the unforeseeably prescient timing of Selmas release in a season of racially motivated unrest and renewed public outrage about the unequal distribution of justice in 21st-century America. One thing this movie reminds us is that the protests of the early 60s spearheaded by black Southern organizers and fueled by ordinary Southern blacks standing up for their rights roused many other Americans to action as well--hundreds of Northern whites traveled South to risk their lives in the fight demonstrating to the watching world that systemic racism is everyones problem. Nearly half a century after that last historic march across Selmas heavily guarded Edmund Pettus Bridge--a humble steel structure that DuVernays camera (the cinematography is by Bradford Young) gives the solid grandeur of an ancient Roman rampart--Kings practice of nonviolent (but never truly ""passive"") resistance seems less than ever like a noble historical relic and more like an urgent design for living.

Joining an already crowded field of Great Man movies about the likes of Stephen Hawking Alan Turing J.M.W. Turner and Louie Zamperini (not to mention Moses) is Ava DuVernays rousing biopic of slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Selma. It isnt just the best film of the bunch it also arrives with a raw-nerve urgency and timeliness that no one could have predicted. Rather than chronicling the full epic sweep of Kings inspirational life from his 1929 birth in Jim Crow Atlanta to his 1968 assassination in Memphis DuVernay and writer Paul Webb wisely zero in on one crucial chapter of Kings legacy the tinderbox three-month period in early 1965 when he led a campaign of civil disobedience to help speed up the passage of President Johnsons Voting Rights Act. I realize that may sound like the snoozy stuff of a high school civics lesson but as Steven Spielberg did with Lincoln DuVernay brilliantly uses a micro event as a way into a larger more compelling macro story. She makes the backroom drudgery of compromise gamesmanship and veiled threats burn with intimacy and intensity. Even though we know how the March on Selma will play out were hanging on every act of potentially deadly political theater every speech and small gesture of defiance. As King British actor David Oyelowo (who played the firebrand activist son of Forest Whitakers character in Lee Daniels The Butler) miraculously rescues the flesh-and-blood man from the myth. He reveals to us the King whos not in our history books -- his humor his human failings and his self-doubt. Just as important he nails not only Kings physical appearance and charisma but also the unique cadence of his soaring oratory. Hes magnificent. And his delivery of Kings ""We Shall Overcome"" speech toward the end of the film is guaranteed to make the hairs on your neck stand up and salute. But lets back up... As the film opens were shown the everyday humiliations suffered by African-Americans in the 60s -- the institutional disenfranchisement and hurdles that make the constitutional right to vote a farce. To draw media attention to this injustice King and his fellow leaders (including Common as James Bevel Stephan James as John Lewis and a wonderful Carmen Ejogo as Kings wife Coretta) plan a historic nonviolent march from Selma Ala. to Montgomery. In the walk-up to the protest King meets with President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) who futilely urges him to take the slow path to progress. And as LBJ Wilkinson makes you see the no-win pressure he was under. Hes a progressive whose ideals are ahead of most of white Americas and more in sync with Kings than either is willing to admit. He understands the inevitability of equality but hes also beholden to good ol boys such as Tim Roths racist Alabama governor George Wallace who helped put him in office but whose politics he cant stomach. DuVernay whose previous film was the 2012 indie Middle of Nowhere doesnt soft-pedal the violence that led up to Kings triumph. In one hauntingly staged fracas Alabama state troopers beat Kings followers with billy clubs and worse. Its sickening to watch especially when you consider just how recent this moment in American history was. DuVernay has done a great service with Selma. Not only has she made one of the most powerful films of the year shes given us a necessary reminder of what King did for this country...and how much is left to be done.

By David Denby Credit Illustration by Concepcion Studios / Photographs Hulton Archive / Getty (March); Courtesy Library of Congress (Banner) At the beginning of Ava DuVernays extraordinary ""Selma"" we hear Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) indulging a private joke with Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) about how long ago they were going to settle down in a small university town and lead a simple life as a preacher and his wife. The year is 1964 and the Kings are in a hotel room in Oslo; he is donning an ascot and a cutaway coat before receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. In his fancy duds hes self-mocking yet proud a crusader at rest. Throughout the movie we hear the voice that we remember--measured and confident and then on the podium full-blooded and exalted. In this film once King launches into any kind of utterance nothing can stop him. The British actor David Oyelowo adds something of his own to the role an extra layer of meditative richness and a touch of sexual playfulness (King is flirting with his wife in the hotel). He also underlines Kings idiosyncratic way of emphasizing the first syllable of words which injects jolts of energy into the smooth and even tones. This King is slightly contemptuous; his composure is barbed. King returns from Oslo just as the civil-rights movement is entering one of its most crucial phases. Earlier in 1964 President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) had pushed the Civil Rights Act through Congress ending legalized segregation. Now he wants to move on to the War on Poverty. But King insists on a voting-rights act to abolish the civics and literacy tests and other tactics used to prevent millions of African-Americans from participating in elections. King fights Johnson in the Oval Office on the phone and from the street. He knows that a large number of people plan to march the fifty miles from Selma to the Alabama state capitol in Montgomery where they will demand to exercise their right to vote and that when they do white racists goaded by Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) will explode in front of the newspaper reporters and the TV cameras. Johnson understands what King is up to and accuses him of reckless opportunism. The two struggle face to face as DuVernay re-creates in personal terms one of the defining moments in the life of the nation. The script in its original form was drafted by an English screenwriter Paul Webb in 2007. Then it floated for years. Oyelowo always wanted to play King and at various times such directors as Michael Mann Stephen Frears Paul Haggis Spike Lee and Lee Daniels were interested in the project which fell apart for lack of sufficient funding. During that time DuVernay now forty-two was working as a film publicist and marketer in Los Angeles. As late as 2011 even after she had directed a feature (""I Will Follow"") she was still a unit publicist (on ""The Help""). Oyelowo who had starred in her 2012 feature ""Middle of Nowhere"" kept advocating on her behalf. Pathe U.K. finally put up the money with assistance from producers including Brad Pitt and Oprah Winfrey and Paramount took over distribution. That a female African-American director was the person finally able to tackle this subject (on a budget of just twenty million dollars) is important but its secondary to the fact that DuVernay has made a very good movie. Like ""Lincoln"" it avoids the lifetime-highlights tendency of standard bio-pics and concentrates instead on a convulsive political process within a fraught period. The compression forces her to capture an entire movement--its gravity its moralism its tactical shrewdness--in three marches across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. Kings greatest mastery as DuVernay shows (she rewrote the script) lay in his resourcefulness and in the way he dominated logistical strategy sessions primarily with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. (The mens appearance in their sombre dark suits white shirts black ties and hats was as dramatically effective as any created by revolutionaries anywhere.) In several key scenes King faces down James Forman and John Lewis the young leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who were already working in Alabama and initially rejected the S.C.L.C. as interlopers. In one of the few weaknesses in the movie the actors cast as Lewis (Stephan James) and Forman (Trai Byers) come off as generic angry young men rather than as individuals. King soothes and inflames them at the same time. This is cinema more rhetorical spectacular and stirring than cable-TV drama again and again DuVernays camera (Bradford Young did the cinematography) tracks behind characters as they march or gentles toward them as they approach receiving them with a friendly hand. At one point during the first march the camera slowly rises and peers over a massive beam on the Edmund Pettus Bridge as hundreds of people advance across it. When Alabama state troopers release tear gas and charge on horseback attacking the marchers with clubs and whips the screen goes white from the gas as if shrouded in terror and the camera hurtles past marchers scrambling to get off the bridge. Many are injured including the activist Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey). The episode which took place on March 7 1965--Bloody Sunday--invokes the tumultuous crowd scenes from silent Soviet classics by Eisenstein and Pudovkin. During the clashes in the White House however DuVernay lets the words and the actors carry the meaning. The reliably impressive Tom Wilkinson recalls without the slightest exaggeration L.B.J.s looming head and neck his heavy hands his easy way with profanity. The icy confrontation between Johnson and Wallace--whom Roth plays as sarcastic and wily with a lizard smile--is a minor classic in itself. Historical irony abounds in bio-pic land our unique American heritage exists onscreen courtesy of talented British actors. DuVernays timing couldnt be more relevant. Next year marks the fiftieth anniversary of both the Selma marches and the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Meanwhile the Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the act last year and Republican legislatures across the country have been deploying new voter-I.D. laws. Faced with all that--and with the recent turmoil in Ferguson Cleveland and New York--King would have noticed how far we have yet to go shaken his head and set to work. Clint Eastwoods ""American Sniper"" is both a devastating war movie and a devastating antiwar movie a subdued celebration of a warriors skill and a sorrowful lament over his alienation and misery. The movie set during the Iraq War has the troubled ambivalence about violence that has shown up repeatedly in Eastwoods work since the famous scene midway through ""Unforgiven"" in which the act of killing anguishes the killer. Eastwood working with the screenwriter Jason Hall and with Bradley Cooper who stars in the film has adapted the 2012 best-selling autobiography by the Navy seal sharpshooter Chris Kyle (which was written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice). ""American Sniper"" is devoted to Kyles life as a son a husband a father and most of all a decorated military man--one of the most lethal snipers in U.S. military history. Kyle who made a hundred and sixty confirmed kills (and more than two hundred probable kills) is always sure that hes defending American troops--and his country--against ""savages."" Perched on a rooftop in Ramadi or in Sadr City hes methodical and imperturbable and he rarely misses even at great distance. He shoots insurgents members of Al Qaeda in Iraq and when he thinks it necessary a woman and a child. Hes haunted by the thought of the Americans he hasnt been able to save. Cooper is all beefed up--by beer as much as by iron from the looks of it (its intentionally not a movie-star body)--and he gives a performance thats vastly different from any that hes given in the past. With fellow-seals in the field hes convivial profane and funny; at home with his loving wife (Sienna Miller whos excellent) hes increasingly withdrawn and dead-eyed enraptured only by the cinema of war playing in his mind. Eastwoods command of this material makes most directors look like beginners. As Kyle and his men ride through rubble-strewn Iraqi cities smash down doors and race up and down stairways the camera records what it needs to fully dramatize a given event and nothing more. Theres no waste never a moments loss of concentration definition or speed. The general atmosphere of the cities and the scattered life of the streets gets packed into the action. The movie of course makes us uneasy and it is meant to. Like Hitchcock in ""Rear Window"" and Michael Powell in ""Peeping Tom"" Eastwood puts us inside the camera lens allowing us to watch the target in closeup as Kyle pulls the trigger. Eastwood has become tauntingly tough-minded ""Youre enjoying this arent you?"" he seems to be saying. And with the remorselessness of age he follows Chris Kyles rehabilitation and redemption back home all the way to their heartbreaking and inexplicable end.

Entertainment Ferguson And Eric Garner Have Made ""Selma"" Painfully Relevant It is set five decades in the past but Ava DuVernays film about Martin Luther King Jr. feels shockingly timely. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures ID 4418623 Selma would be a good movie in any year. It is directed with elegance and power by Ava DuVernay (Middle of Nowhere) it is dynamically acted and it was handsomely shot by cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year). It closes in on Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) during the window of the Selma to Montgomery marches which led to the passing of the 1965 Voting Rights Act showing him as a great man but a human one one with doubts and very justified fears. It depicts how difficult it is to effect change and portrays nonviolent protest as a means of forcing the hate and brutality of others into the light sometimes at a terrible cost. Itd be a good movie any year but given the events of the last few months its now an almost unbearably resonant one. I walked out of my Selma screening and into a night of demonstrations about the Eric Garner grand jury decision protests that filled the streets of New York and cities across the country. Garner and Mike Brown are only the most recent and high-profile cases of unarmed black men dying at the hands of police officers who were then cleared of any wrongdoing and theyre indicative of a deeply disturbing trend finally generating broader outrage. Were 50 years past the era of Selma which begins just months after the passing of the Civil Rights Act but race remains a stunningly divisive point in our country and the equal rights treatment and opportunity that are in theory granted to everyone continue in practice to be denied on the basis of the color of your skin. Selma is a vivid reminder of how much our national narrative about race differs from the actual experience of being a black American then and now and how endemic racism and prejudice will be left as is unless theyre exposed and brought to wider attention -- attention that must be battled for and fought to achieve. ID 4418366 Paramount Pictures Paramount Pictures ID 4420772 Here are the hardest scenes in Selma to watch The one in which young activist Jimmie Lee Jackson (Keith Stanfield) is shot at close range by an Alabama State Trooper (the shooter James Bonard Fowler would later claim self-defense even though Jackson was unarmed and a grand jury did not indict him). The one in which Annie Lee Cooper (Oprah Winfrey also one of the films producers) gets thrown to the ground by Selma Sheriff Jim Clarks (Stan Houston) men at a protest in front of the county courthouse. The one in which hundreds of marchers are gassed and beaten by troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge while stunned viewers watch on the news. The one in which Unitarian minister James Reeb (Jeremy Strong) is attacked by malicious locals targeting the outsiders whove come to support King. He dies. These sequences are painful not just because of what they depict but because of how they can echo contemporary events -- particularly in the case of Jackson in which the horror of the moment briefly slows time the quiet giving way to his mothers screams of shock and grief. There are other scenes that evoke the present day in more maddening ways like in the exchanges President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) has with King in which he treats the protests as a matter of political inconvenience rather than moral imperative and in which he suggests that the responsibility for the people who get hurt in the protests is on King rather than on the ones perpetrating the violence and the politician who refuses to send troops in to stop it. Then theres a smirking Tim Roth as Alabama governor George Wallace drawling out messages of racism to a supportive crowd as if hes only being reasonable. ID 4419990 Paramount Pictures Paramount Pictures ID 4420373 Selma is bound to attract comparisons to 12 Years a Slave given the year-end timing and its exploration of another grim chapter in Americans racial history. But the better comparison would be Lincoln which like Selma is a film that avoids the comfort of triumphalism in favor of showing the work and maneuvering King his team and his supporters do. DuVernay frequently frames King from behind the cameras gaze aimed at the back of his head and shoulders. It emphasizes his remove -- Kings aware of the kind of symbol hes become whether giving an impassioned speech or getting punched by a waiting white man when checking into a hotel. He and his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) discuss his self-consciousness about dressing in a way or owning things that would make them look above his followers. King as played with watchful subtlety by Oyelowo is engaged in a calculated high-stakes perilous war of politics and public relations and Selma shows him speaking frankly about the brokenness of a system in which white officials jurors and politicians get to mete out justice for everyone. Johnsons part of that acting only when events get too ugly to be ignored trying to co-opt King while hanging on to him as the peaceful alternative to someone more militant. ""What he needs to do is get on board with what were doing"" he barks to his advisor Lee C. White (Giovanni Ribisi) in private but King has no interest in joining a war on poverty when the people hes representing are blocked from registering to vote so cant be represented and cant be part of a jury. ID 4420391 View this image > Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures ID 4420728 King is just as up-front about how the Southern Christian Leadership Conference campaigns work -- they need press they need cameras and they need monstrous racists who will do terrible things that will be broadcast around the country and world. He freely tells James Forman (Trai Byers) that there was insufficient drama to what they did in Albany because the sheriff didnt make the kind of mistakes they required. He lauds the work Forman has been doing to ""raise black consciousness"" but notes that hes focused on ""raising white consciousness"" using the abuses inflicted upon protesters to insist attention be paid writing demands in the blood thats shed with specific goals in mind each time. DuVernay wrote the films intelligent script with Paul Webb and has brought together a tremendous cast to fill out both the major and minor roles -- Orange Is the New Blacks Lorraine Toussaint Common Cuba Gooding Jr. Niecy Nash Alessandro Nivola Wendell Pierce The Knicks Andre Holland and Dear White Peoples Tessa Thompson are among them. Ejogo has some nice business in scenes that highlight the strains Kings activism has put on his home life and his marriage. But Selma is foremost about the difficult work that was done to shake people out of complacency to make them stand up and join the fight. It doesnt have room or any need to sentimentalize and despite the difficult history yet to unfold -- recounted in text on-screen in the final sequence -- it doesnt jerk tears. Instead it raises goose bumps as that crowd finally marches over the bridge and into the future. ID 4420789 Selma opens in limited release on Dec. 25 and in more theaters on Jan. 9.

The battle for equality spearheaded by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has been touched on indirectly in such films as The Long Walk Home Mississippi Burning and Lee Daniels The Butler. Now Ava DuVernays Selma as the title suggests tackles the subject head-on -- and more importantly does it justice. The film received its world premiere at AFI Fest and although a few scenes are still receiving a technical polish and the end titles were not complete the audience gave the picture a rapturous ovation. DuVernays earlier films such as Middle of Nowhere have been intimate dramas. So this epic tale with a large cast of characters and violent confrontation scenes represents a departure for the director. Yet the strength of the film is the sense of proportion that DuVernay demonstrates. In a season of so many bloated overlong films this two-hour recounting of a few crucial months in 1965 seems just the right length. Intelligently written vividly shot tightly edited and sharply acted the film represents a rare example of craftsmanship working to produce a deeply moving piece of history. See more Martin Luther King Jr. Fights for Freedom in Selma Trailer The film written by Paul Webb makes an intriguing companion piece to Robert Schenkkans Tony-winning play All the Way which showed how Lyndon Johnson manipulated members of Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Johnson also figures prominently in Selma as King urges the reluctant president to get behind voting rights legislation a campaign that ended with Johnson introducing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The film gets off to a slightly shaky start. It opens with King receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm then cuts to the bombing of the church in Birmingham that killed four black girls. That juxtaposition seems a bit forced and on-the-nose. The film surprisingly find its tone in a short scene that follows in which a Selma resident attempts to register to vote and is turned away. The surprise is that the character is played by superstar Oprah Winfrey (one of the films producers) who does not call attention to herself but blends convincingly into the period and seems representative of the ordinary black citizen who gained a voice partly as a result of Dr. Kings crusade to extend freedom to all Americans. DuVernays experience making much smaller domestic films shows in her attention to all the faces in the backgrounds of scenes and to all the actors who have only a few minutes onscreen and yet register vividly. Nigel Thatch offers a remarkable impersonation of Malcolm X in one brief but telling scene with Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo) in which he suggests that his public conflicts with King may have actually been part of an effective good cop/bad cop strategy that worked to the movements benefit. In another fine cameo Henry G. Sanders is heartbreaking as the 82-year-old father of a man murdered in Selma. Its no accident that the film is called Selma rather than King. DuVernay and Webb want to provide a tapestry of a movement rather than a hagiography of one great leader. The film gives time to all the people who worked alongside Dr. King sometimes arguing and at other times supporting him as they struggled to refine their strategy. Those who think they know the story will have their memories jogged by bits of less familiar history like Kings initial decision to turn back from the march to Montgomery. Read more MLK Drama Selma Sets Christmas Day Limited Release DuVernay brings these backroom negotiations to life but she also demonstrates an unexpected flair for widescreen spectacle. The initial march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma which led to a savage attack on the marchers by troopers on horseback is a breathtaking sequence. Cinematographer Bradford Young and editor Spencer Averick make major contributions throughout the film. The cast also shines. Although there is a long tradition of British actors playing Southerners going back to Vivien Leigh as Scarlett OHara it does seem a bit strange that three of the key roles here are played by Brits. As LBJ Tom Wilkinson sometimes veers a little too close to caricature but he rouses himself for his final speech to Congress which is heartfelt and affecting. Tim Roth as George Wallace captures the shrewdness as well as the viciousness of the racist governor. In her comments after the AFI screening DuVernay generously acknowledged British-born actor David Oyelowo as the films prime mover. He dreamed of playing King for years and enlisted her to direct. Although Oyelowo doesnt look or sound exactly like King he gives a definitive performance. His rousing speeches are superbly done and his moments of introspection and self-doubt retrieve the humanity in a leader who has come to seem larger than life. This years race for best actor which is already packed with strong contenders may just have a new front-runner. And DuVernay may also make history by becoming the first African-American woman nominated as best director. This stirring yet always level-headed piece of history does what all the best films accomplish It opens hearts and minds.

"Selma Review Oyelowo And DuVernays Vivid MLK Bio-Pic | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Selma Scott Foundas Chief Film Critic foundasonfilm 19 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr November 12 2014 | 0904AM PT Ava DuVernays politically astute psychologically acute MLK biopic makes the civil rights movement seem like only yesterday. A half-century on from Martin Luther King Jr.s historic voting-rights march from Selma Alabama to the state capitol in Montgomery director Ava DuVernay revisits those events with startling immediacy dramatic force and filmmaking verve in ""Selma."" A far cry from the dutiful biopic or ossified history lesson it could have become in lesser hands (or the campy free-for-all the projects original director Lee Daniels might have made of it) DuVernays razor-sharp portrait of the civil rights movement -- and Dr. King himself -- at a critical crossroads is as politically astute as it is psychologically acute giving us a human-scale King whose indomitable public face belies currents of weariness and self-doubt. Bolstered by Paul Webbs literate well-researched script and David Oyelowos graceful majestic lead performance DuVernay has made the kind of movie that gives year-end ""prestige"" pics a good name which should equate to considerable box-office and awards-season gold for this Dec. 25 Paramount release. While King has figured as a peripheral character in many civil-rights-themed dramas including Spike Lees ""Malcolm X"" ""The Long Walk Home"" (about the Montgomery bus riders boycott) and the recent ""The Butler"" the only attempt at a full-fledged King biopic to date was the three-part 1978 TV miniseries ""King"" starring Paul Winfield in the title role. Probably the sheer enormity of Kings life and achievements seemed a daunting subject for any one movie to convey but its a task ""Selma"" ably tackles by focusing on a piece of Kings story that feels representative of the whole. The microcosmic approach recalls playwright Tony Kushners script for Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" a movie ""Selma"" also resembles in its fascination with the mix of politics showmanship and media manipulation by which real change gets accomplished in America. But in the end ""Selma"" may be the more impressive achievement in its effortless balance of the intimate and epic and its notable absence of great-man mythmaking. As depicted here the Selma-to-Montgomery march (or rather marches) came at a crucial juncture in the civil rights movement when the stubborn persistence of leaders like King had done much to turn the tide of race relations in America in theory if not in practice. While the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act had legally desegregated the South towns like Selma remained very dangerous places to be a black man or woman with Jim Crow discrimination still in effect especially with regard to the contentious subject of voter registration. Throughout the South majority-black voting districts showed minuscule percentages of registered blacks and disproportionately large numbers of whites (often due to the names of dead or relocated residents being left on the voting rolls) while white police and voting officials employed a wide range of arcane laws and intimidation tactics to discourage black citizens from even attempting to register. And under the leadership of the racist Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) Alabama was hardly inclined to change. That was the battleground onto which King and other members of his Southern Christian Leadership Conference ventured in January 1965 and DuVernay and Webb spend much of ""Selmas"" first half setting that stage -- literally in the sense that King is drawn to Selma in part because of its theatrical possibilities. At the time King and the SCLC were still licking their wounds from a yearlong anti-segregation campaign in Albany Ga. that had yielded relatively little media attention or measurable results in part because of the uncharacteristically civil behavior of the local white authorities who refused to counter Kings nonviolent protests with the kind of violent retaliations that had made headlines during the SCLCs 1963 Birmingham campaign. ""Is your sheriff Bull Connor or is he Laurie Pritchett?"" King asks early upon his Selma arrival trying to get a bead on where the local law enforcement falls on the Birmingham-Albany spectrum.  When the answer comes back ""Bull Connor"" he knows hes come to the right place. A former publicist who previously directed two low-budget dramatic features (including the excellent ""Middle of Nowhere"" also with Oyelowo) DuVernay has here made a panoramic choral film that juxtaposes Kings grassroots work in Selma against his White House lobbying efforts (with a combustible Tom Wilkinson as LBJ) potent glimpses of the ordinary men and women drawn into Kings orbit (like the hospice nurse Annie Lee Cooper well played by Oprah Winfrey also one of the films producers) and a smart depiction of the internal friction within the civil rights movement itself from the less confrontational likes of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to the aggressive agitation of a Malcolm X (played in one superb provocative scene by Nigel Thatch). Though the canvas of ""Selma"" is markedly larger than anything DuVernay has tackled before she makes the transition with no evident strain. Shot on location in Selma itself the movie is beautifully staged even when the events it depicts are at their ugliest -- such as the infamous ""Bloody Sunday"" confrontation between Kings marchers and Selma police on the Edmund Pettus Bridge an expert action setpiece in which every thud of a nightstick lands with a sickening force. (The cinematography is by Bradford Young one of the few cameramen who truly understands how to light black actors.) But ""Selma"" is rarely more affecting than in its quiet scenes of King alone or surrounded by a few trusted advisers at the end of a long day in the trenches plotting his next move. The British-born Oyelowo who was brilliant as Forest Whitakers Freedom Rider-turned-Black Panther son in the best scenes of ""The Butler"" is a marvelously internal actor whose piercing brown eyes fleshy cheeks and broad forehead seem to register every thought that flashes through his mind. Hes uncanny at replicating Kings fiery public orations but hes even more impressive as the pensive reflective private King a man haunted by what he calls ""the constant closeness of death"" played with none of the self-important airs that can sometimes afflict actors cast as secular saints. Oyelowos King is above all a man with a mans problems including a damaged relationship with his wife Coretta (the remarkable British actress Carmen Ejogo) who needs no surreptitious wiretaps from J. Edgar Hoover (a sniveling Dylan Baker) to know that her husband is far from a perfect man. Although Kings infidelities are a well-known part of the historical record it still comes as something of a surprise to see the sober unvarnished way ""Selma"" confronts them in a shattering scene of two loving spouses trying to salvage what remains of their marriage. As it turns its focus to the planning of the Montgomery march (which finally took place from March 21-25 after two aborted attempts earlier that month) ""Selmas"" political shrewdness rises to the fore as DuVernay and Webb detail the game of inches played by King LBJ and Wallace to curtail a second ""Bloody Sunday."" The movie has the electric feel of events unfolding in the moment even if we already know how everything turned out. That feeling extends to Kings impassioned ""How Long Not Long"" speech delivered on the Montgomery capitol steps -- a sequence DuVernay movingly stages through an assembly of re-enactments and actual newsreel footage. Its a powerful moment by any measure but one that takes on uncanny resonances as King talks about the ""vicious lie"" of racial superiority passed down from one generation to the next -- words that seem all too prescient in the age of post-Katrina Louisiana riot-torn Ferguson and the various campaigns to delegitimize the presidency of Barack Obama. So ""Selma"" ends on a note of queasy triumph with the sense that we have come so far and yet still have so far to go and the hope that the arc of the moral universe does indeed bend toward justice. The films ace ensemble casting extends to its smallest roles including Cuba Gooding Jr. (doing his best work in years) as civil rights attorney Fred Gray and Martin Sheen as federal district court judge Frank M. Johnson. DuVernays intelligent understated approach extends to the films musical choices a sparingly used original score by Jason Moran and a few choice spirituals including Sister Gertrude Morgans ""I Got the New World in My View"" and Martha Bass ""Walk with Me"" in lieu of the eras more familiar (and overused) pop protest songs.

Thomas says May 7 2015 at 600 am Touching engaging and educating its a film that should be shown in schools and which everyone even only remotely interested in this topic should have a look at. Reply John says January 14 2015 at 1045 pm Also how is trying to delegitimize Obama racist? Obama is a bad president and that has nothing to do with race. Reply John says January 14 2015 at 1042 pm Why are you the filmmakers and every other critic comparing this to Ferguson. There is no proof that Fergusons shooting was racially motivated. Im not quite sure why so many critics are praising this movie solely for being ""relevant."" I severely dislike how you compared Selma to what is currently happening today. What happened in Ferguson and New York have nothing to do with race; it was police brutality that the media turned into a race issue. Do you realize that there are many unarmed white hispanic and native people who are also murdered by officers? And do you realize that there were many protests that were not peaceful in Ferguson. Peoples businesses were looted and burned by protesters and you do not bring it up once even though Selma could be argued as a call for peaceful protesting over looting and violence. Reply Andrea Ruby says January 10 2015 at 220 pm I dont understand why this film is receiving so much attention. The movie isnt that good definitely not worth 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. I assume its difficult to make a historical film because what dont we already know? Also this film makes LBJ look like a saint. Terrible movie. This cannot beat Birdman. Reply Melvis McIlroy says December 1 2014 at 933 pm Separating aspiration from actuality this was a terrible movie. Wish it had been in more capable hands to have avoided the yawning social studies book text and the cartoonish Caucasians that populate the screen with clubs harsh lightning and camera angles and enough N words to make Quentin Tarrantino take notice. While attempting social relevance and trying to teach a history lesson for which they are not qualified the makers missed the opportunity to make a nuanced and powerful portrait about Rev King and this moment in history. The massive star cast is wasted with literal cameos worthy of Love Boat and we never get to know any of the men that shared the harrowing journey next to MLK. Add in long talky scenes that run together like a student film and you see where this whiffed. I get that everyone wants films to be important to say important things whether it be Milk or Selma but for petes sake dont forget to start with a watchable script. dontbelievethehype Reply Gregg Calumet says January 10 2015 at 346 pm I truly believe you are trolling. Have you even seen the actual film? And for a film that occurs exactly when Jim Crow was high the film did not use that many N-word references (albeit it was casually used by Southern whites so much). And definitely not at the same gratuitous level that Tarantino uses in his films. The cast did an EXCELLENT job with the material and I agree with Scott Foundas the cinematography on the film was great; especially when capturing the events of Bloody Sunday"" on Pettus Bridge. Reply Charles says January 19 2015 at 119 pm I did see the film on Friday night at the request of a friend. I am 66 not a Southerner and a History major who was familiar with the strife of the time. I found the film to be average at best the acting mediocre the story fairly accurate for a movie and the dialogue incredibly boring. How this is up for any award is beyond me. I believe all the good reviews are coming from those not wishing to be labeled racist. A much better film of the time is Mississippi Burning. Daphne says December 10 2014 at 530 am 100% right on Well cast brilliant acting no script no direction Plodding and aimless with Oprah popping up on screen every 10 minutes Reply dr Mimi sisson says November 28 2014 at 1241 am A rousing thank you for Cynthia stillwell casting for an enormous cinematic task of interviewing and choosing extras for Selma. Visual perfection. Reply Dennis Brown says November 18 2014 at 647 am At the risk of being a vocabulary bore may I point out that Foundas doesnt seem to know what ""enormity"" means. It does not mean ""hugeness""; it means ""extreme wickedness"". Reply Regular Joe says November 12 2014 at 1117 pm Had ""12 Years A Slave"" not won 2014 Id say this was a lock for 2015. Initial critics are gushing about Selma the way historians gush about MLK. Will be very interesting (and entertaining) to see how this plays out with middle America and with the Academy. Could go many ways. Reply John says November 12 2014 at 1044 pm I see Oprah attached to this and I think ""cheesy"". No thanks. Reply Ger Kennelly says November 15 2014 at 804 am she ""confronted"" james frey then she gushes over war criminal obama Reply Ashlie Atkinson says November 12 2014 at 1102 am This is a great review. However its vital to note that it wasnt the ""riots"" (which could be more correctly called ""demonstrations"") that tore Ferguson apart but the murder of Michael Brown. To call Ferguson ""riot-torn"" is hideously misleading. It is a grieving community that cannot trust its ""protectors"". Reply Michael Daniels says November 13 2014 at 434 am I agree with Ashlie Atkinson. The police attitude towards African Americans in our community of St. Louis/Ferguson is emblematic of Jim Crow combined with a state law that encourages and supports the use of deadly force. In Missouri Michael Brown must prove excessive deadly force as opposed to the cop being required to defend his action. Who represents the Michael Browns? We do and we must Reply Frida says November 12 2014 at 1041 pm Sorry. It was rioting arson and looting with some peaceful people standing around. Reply Yasmin Jeanice Mattox says November 13 2014 at 438 am So you look at what the one percent of people do to color how you represent the other ninety-nine? The vast majority of individuals demonstrated peacefully. And to clarify people need not be polite or kind in their words when demonstrating. They can yell scream use all sorts of profanities if they want. The vast majority of protestors did not riot and the record proves that. Amy Taubin says November 12 2014 at 951 am How could you have overlooked the 2001 HBO movie ""Boycott"". Jeffrey Wrights stars as King and gives one of the all-time great American movie performances. Reply Michelle says November 12 2014 at 937 am Too bad were practically right back to that same era with Police Brutality murders of unarmed men going unprosecuted and the Voter ID Acts.

Most Oscar-season end-of-year films about American history creak and groan into theaters like mannequins wrapped in grade-school civics lessons Blank in the eyes hollow on the inside handcufffed and hobbled by the kind of history that gets written by the winners. Director Ava DuVernays ""Selma"" --  screened in its entirety at the AFI Film Festival Tuesday as a last-minute change from an originally planned 30-minute preview -- is the exact opposite of the noble immobile sepia-toned biopics that usually define the Awards season. See photos Party Report at AFI Fest Mark Wahlberg John Goodman Ari Emanuel Jessica Chastain and a Mob (Photos) Instead its vital funny human and complex with British actor David Oyelowo playing King as Paul Webbs script follows the icon through the tactics and truths of a historic civil rights protest march King led from Selma Ala. to Montgomery in 1965. The march was to protest and draw attention to the systematic and deliberate disenfranchisement of black voters in the South a crime of power that happened long before Kings rise to prominence and continues as recently as Election Day 2014; its a story of the American past and the role a leader played in changing his era but this isnt the usual dry recounting of facts and soft-focused hero-building. Its far more and far better than that. DuVernays previous film ""Middle of Nowhere"" was a similar mix of the personal and the political following a couples fight to stay in love after one of them enters the prison system. Yet as excellent as ""Middle of Nowhere"" was it only hinted at the majestic wide-screen power she brings to bear in almost every frame here. Also read Ava DuVernays Martin Luther King Jr Film Selma Earns Standing Ovation at AFI Fest DuVernay creates ""Selmas"" striking visual grammar with the substantial and significant help of cinematographer Bradford Young (""A Most Violent Year"") and Youngs camerawork perfectly captures everything from the massed power of a group on the march to the quiet pain of betrayal and forgiveness between a man and a woman with equal artistry and facility. Webbs screenplay is also superb not just intelligent but emotionally wise with no small amount of very real humor even as it shows us very real horrors. Oyelowos performance would be impressive enough if it merely recreated the icon we now revere as perfectly as he does through a variety of methods -- the cadence of the speeches the gestures made to the crowd the political theater of and principled belief in fearlessness and compassion as the only counter to violence and ignorance. But Oyelowo and Webbs screenplay also give us a rich rewarding portrait of King as a man one capable of mistakes self-doubt and hurt. A scene between King and his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) where she not only confronts him about his infidelities but also puts them into aching ruined context is a masterclass in two-person scenework. Paramount ""Selma"" also makes no bones about the realities and hard work of politicking whether in Kings meetings with President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) or in his attempts to try and win over the young black activists of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee who were on the ground in Selma long before King and who worry hell overshadow their efforts. Much like ""Milk"" another great American biopic that mixed the personal the political and the present tense ""Selma"" recognizes how activists have to be keep an eye not only on their obvious enemies but also on other activists who should logically be allies. Also read Oprah Winfrey to Play Civil Rights Protester Annie Lee Cooper in MLK Movie Selma ""Selma"" does have a few loose threads poking out of its grand tapestry. Wilkinson is miscast; his Johnson is too refined too restrained. The film also could do a better job of marking its timeline how long King was in Selma the days between marches and so on.  The films final credits are also far clumsier than the skillful subtle and strong film that comes before them presenting a montage of footage weve already seen over a painfully earnest and square-cornered song by Common (who also acts in the film) both seeming as if theyre trying too hard to use their three minutes to recap and recontextualize the entire film. These are minor quibbles though in the face of so much that works so well to make ""Selma"" as good as it is. The ensemble is broad deep and uniformly excellent including Wendell Pierce (""The Wire"") Tessa Thompson (""Dear White People"") producer Oprah Winfrey a superb Tim Roth as Alabama governor George Wallace and many many more. DuVernay and Webb are unafraid to show the King that our more convenient histories also gloss over --  an advocate not just for racial equality but also economic equality someone who asked how the American government could waste millions of dollars and thousands of lives to promote democracy in Vietnam but wouldnt help its own citizens exercise their democratic right to vote in Alabama. As King asks out of doubt and despair while in jail a black man can now sit at the same lunch counter as a white man but what if he doesnt have the money to buy lunch due to poverty or if he cant even read the menu because he never got a proper education? Also read Oprah Winfrey Dedicates Syracuse s Revamped 18 Million Communications Center and D ick Clark Studios At one point Oyelowos King states that he will no longer tolerate being led astray into ""the dark corners of the halls of power."" Its a turn of phrase that speaks to our time as much as it does his. Voter suppression in 2014 may be more genteel -- in Texas new laws demand ""approved"" photo ID from voters; in Kansas voters now have to show ""proof of citizenship""; and in North Carolina early voting has been cut short even as same-day registration to vote has been eliminated -- but it is just as real and just as racist as the billyclubs and bullwhips used in Selma in the 60s. During the final march from Selma to Montgomery DuVernay cuts from her recreation of the march to archival footage of the actual march and what sounds like a disconnect brings the film truly home King wasnt some saint who lived above normal Americans; he was a man who walked alongside them and his achievements are all the more inspiring and intimidating because he was as flawed and strong as vulnerable and powerful as we are. Most American dramas about politics are made to comfort your complacency and soothe you to sleep; the best thing about ""Selma"" is how Ms. DuVernays version and vision of Dr. King dares to send you out from the theater and into the world awake and aware.

Rodman won three Razzie Awards for his performance in the film.Larry Bird One of the NBAs all-time greats appeared as himself in ""Space Jam"" wisely telling Bill Murray that he should stick with acting and give up his basketball dreams.
