The rest of the road-company cast in The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas matches Addys amiable blandness and in a way thats a relief after the 1990s glut of features badly remade from old TV shows. With no headliners to raise hopes this negligible entertainment has its own boneheaded charms. A prequel to the previous coarser film it explains how brawny Fred won over Wilma (Kristen Johnson) despite the objections of her Dynasty-gorgon of a mother (Joan Collins) and how dim Barney (Stephen Baldwin) shared stupidities with Betty (Jane Krakowski).

Its actually a prequel to the 1994 live-action feature based on the popular animated TV series. Even with splashy special effects from Rhythm amp; Hues and Jim Hensons Creature Shop ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" has the look and feel of a second-rate direct-to-video sequel in which pennies are pinched and bets are hedged. Its actually a prequel to the 1994 live-action feature based on the popular animated TV series. But whereas the first ""Flintstones"" pic -- which scored more than  300 million in worldwide grosses -- made at least a token attempt to amuse ticketbuyers old enough to recall firstrun telecasts of the 1960-66 sitcom the excruciatingly lame followup is aimed squarely at grade-schoolers. Silly script broad slapstick and overstated lead perfs by B-team cast might be acceptable to target audience. But lack of cross-generational appeal will curtail this prehistoric romps long-term theatrical prospects hastening its evolution to ancillary venues. Set a decade or so before the previous live-action opus ""Viva Rock Vegas"" focuses on the often rocky courtships of Fred Flintstone and Wilma Slaghoople -- the couple destined to become a modern Stone Age family-- and Barney Rubble and Betty OShale. This time-tripping dodge allows the producers to recast the lead roles with slightly younger -- and presumably less expensive -- leads. Mark Addy (""The Full Monty"") and Kristen Johnston (TVs ""Third Rock From the Sun"") replace John Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins as Fred and Wilma while Stephen Baldwin and Jane Krakowski sub for Rick Moranis and Rosie ODonnell as Barney and Betty. (Listen closely and youll hear ODonnell as the voice of -- no kidding -- an octopus masseuse.) The world of the Flintstones is rife with prehistoric beasts that serve as pets servants and low-tech equipment and as in the previous pic the intricately detailed puppets and computer-generated creatures are as animated and almost as charismatic as their hand-drawn equivalents in the old TV show. (Best sight gag a squawking smart-mouthed bird thats employed as a remote-control device.) But its hard to shake the impression that some of the big-ticket f/x such as the roller-coaster ride atop interlocked dinosaurs are just so much product placement for upcoming rides at Universal theme parks. Indeed even more than the previous pic ""Viva Rock Vegas"" forces you to question the whole point of making a live-action version of an animated cartoon. As you marvel at the production design and special effects you still may find yourself responding to the whole enterprise the same way you would respond to a scale-model of the Eiffel Tower constructed with Popsicle sticks. Four scribes are credited with cobbling together the tissue-thin plot. Under the direction of Brian Levant who also helmed the first ""Flintstones"" feature ""Viva Rock Vegas"" is far more frenetic and simplistic than an average episode of the relatively sophisticated 60s TV series. Wilma turns out to be a poor little rich girl the discontent daughter of the fabulously wealthy and snidely snobbish Pearl Slaghoople (Joan Collins). Pearl wants Wilma to marry Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson) the handsome scion of a respectable old-money family. But Wilma has her heart set on settling down with Fred so she brings her intended along with Barney and Betty to a lavish birthday party for her doddering father Col. Slaghoople (Harvey Korman). When Fred inadvertently ruins the celebration Chip appears to take it all in stride and graciously invites Fred Wilma Barney and Betty to the opening of his new resort hotel in Rock Vegas. Once the two couples arrive in the party-hearty city however Chip manages to make things less than pleasant for Fred. To fully insure that younger tykes will laugh at the madcap goings-on ""Viva Rock Vegas"" adds a shamelessly kid-friendly gimmick to the mix. Alan Cumming lends his face and voice to the f/x rendering of The Great Gazoo a pint-size extraterrestrial who flits in and out of the plot. (Cumming also plays to even less amusing effect a Brit rocker named Mick Jagged who briefly woos Betty.) Gazoo who can be seen only by Fred and Barney wants to study the mating habits of primitive Earthlings. His periodic observation of Fred and Wilma cues some strenuously unfunny one-liners and a lazily conceived deus-ex-machina climax. But Gazoo isnt the only telltale sign of desperation on the part of the filmmakers. Pic resorts to tired jokes about dinosaur farts pies in faces and Fred and Barney in showgirl drag. One of the few clever touches Ann-Margret who starred opposite Elvis Presley in ""Viva Las Vegas"" (1964) sings a revised version of the title song on the soundtrack here. The four leads vacillate between bland competence and charmless bluster. Addy sounds more like Ralph Kramden than Fred Flintstone but at least hes closer to the mark than Baldwin who turns Barney into a total numskull. Johnston and Krakowski are cartoonish in the worst sense of the term. Which come to think of it could be said about the pic as a whole.

This sequel to the 1994 live-action Flintstones is actually a prequel to the saga of Fred Flintstone his pal Barney Rubble and their respective wives the former Wilma Slaghoople and Betty OShale. But as directed by Brian Levant in an encore from 1994 and written by the teams of Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont and Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas stumbles at its outset by setting up an adult premise inevitably undone by the films aspirations to family entertainment. What results is a candy-colored broad comedy with noteworthy performances by Mark Addy (of The Full Monty no less) as a Jackie Gleason-like Fred; Jane Krakowski (of Ally McBeal) as Betty; and Alan Cumming (of Cabaret et al.) as the preening British rock star Mick Jagged. The young Dino the purple Flintstone pet hatched from an egg won at a carnival proves a lovable slobbering bundle of saurian energy. But the films framing device with Mr. Cumming (again) as the Great Gazoo an extraterrestrial from a species that reproduces by division who is sent to Earth to study the mating habits of humans fails to capitalize on its comic potential. Nevertheless thanks to the effects of Jim Hensons Creature Shop and the animation and visual effects of Rhythm and Hues Studios there is plenty to fill the eye and poke the ribs if little to tickle a well-evolved funny bone. As usual wordplay abounds in prehistoric automobiles like the Maserocki and in garish resort hotels like the Tardust the Saharoc and the Molten Nugget. Modern means find their counterparts in a gigantic bridge and a roller coaster along the backs and tails of brontosauruses clamshell gambling chips and an octopus that can massage two clients at once. As for plot it goes something like this Around the time that Fred and his dimwitted pal Barney (Stephen Baldwin) graduate from the Bronto Crane Academy qualifying them for work in the Bedrock quarry Gazoo arrives to study mating habits. But Fred and Barney the first earthlings whom Gazoo encounters have no mates. On an outing to the local Bronto Burger they encounter Betty one of the roller-skating waitresses and Wilma (Kristen Johnston) who has run away from the snooty castle and empty-headed social circle she was reared in. The softhearted Betty has fixed up the klutzy Wilma with a job believing her to be penniless and homeless. Betty is unaware of Wilmas high-fashion mother the overweening over-the-top Pearl Slaghoople (Joan Collins) a regular Joan Crawfish; her father the dotty Colonel Slaghoople (Harvey Korman); and the handsome hissable Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson) a supposedly wealthy Rock Vegas resort owner. Pearl Slaghoople is pushing Wilma to marry Chip and while he seems determined to win her heart his emotions are actually fixed on her money because criminal creditors are after his life. On a double date at an amusement park (Fred to Barney in preparation Barney tonight we shower) the pals realize they are with the wrong partners and after a switch Fred pairs off with Wilma and Barney with Betty. But when Fred is humiliated at a lavish party at Slaghoople Manor Chip pretends to make amends by inviting the four friends to the opening of his casino in Rock Vegas where trouble and misunderstandings await. In the guise of hospitality the rotten Chip intends to extend credit and then bankrupt Fred at the gaming tables frame him as the thief who stole Wilmas famous pearls and have Wilma for himself. And Betty who has seen Barney with Chips voluptuous playmate Roxie (Alex Meneses) will assuage her grief with Mick Jagged. But the Great Gazoo who has been absent for large stretches of this adventure is about to intervene. So after a turn with Barney dressed as a showgirl Fred will be able to yell Yabba-dabba-doo and if enough people pay enough money another Flintstones will be chiseled out of Bedrock in a few more years. The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some comic sexual suggestiveness and comic violence.

Starring Maggie Smith  Michael Gambon and Fiona Shaw . Directed by Deborah Warner . Written by John Banville . (R. 104 minutes. At the Embarcadero Shattuck in Berkeley Piedmont in Oakland and Northgate in San Rafael.) . The final hurrah of British rule in the Republic of Ireland is captured in ""The Last September"" a handsome exquisitely photographed version of the 1929 Elizabeth Bowen novel. Set in 1920 shortly before the British vacated its a multi-character drama about the pull between progress and tradition and the passions that strain beneath all that starched linen and tweed. ""The Last September"" stars Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon as Sir Richard and Lady Myra wealthy aristocrats whose country home in County Cork becomes a crossroads for social change. As the Irish war for independence heats up the unquestioned privilege theyve long enjoyed starts to disappear. Richard and Myra share their house with niece Lois (Keeley Hawes) nephew Lawrence (Jonathan Slinger) and houseguests Francie and Hugo (Jane Birkin and Lambert Wilson). Another friend (the terrific Fiona Shaw) also appears and young Lois is torn between a British army captain (David Tennant) and a Irish rebel (Gary Lydon) whos wrong for her and therefore irresistible. ""September"" marks the film debut of British theater director Deborah Warner. She has a gift for bringing out grace notes in her actors and wisely chose a master cinematographer Polands Slawomir Idziak (""The Double Life of Veronique"") for her debut. Theres nothing cinematically new in the problems of faded aristocracy in the early 20th century -- Merchant Ivory has covered this ground -- but the quality of acting in ""September"" coupled with Idziaks images warrant a visit. -- Advisory This film contains nudity and violence. Edward Guthmann ""THE FILTH AND THE FURY"" Documentary. Directed by Julien Temple. (At the Lumiere and the UC Berkeley. Rated R. 105 minutes.) Johnny Rotten has a rather bleak outlook but he manages. ""Even in your grimmest moments"" he says in the new Sex Pistols documentary ""The Filth and the Fury"" his steel eyes veering ""you laugh."" The Sex Pistols the short-lived London punk band that took rock n roll to the brink and dangled it by its ankles are subjected to historic re evaluation in Julien Temples new documentary. The movie traces all the bands lurid trials -- the pious condemnations the knife attacks the disastrous Sid Vicious. Above all it makes one thing clear This group was wickedly funny. Temple who directed the preposterous 1980 Sex Pistols eulogy ""The Great Rock n Roll Swindle"" takes a comparatively orthodox approach in this second effort. There are still plenty of annoyances -- the band members are interviewed in silhouette and manager Malcolm McLarens voice is accompanied by someone in a creepy rubber face mask. But if the Sex Pistols were put on this earth for anything at all it was to irritate. The film is pockmarked with clips of Englands most absurd television comedians; Rotten (John Lydon) considers them his forebears along with Oliviers great grotesques the Hunchback and Richard III. Fittingly the Sex Pistols were born during a months-long garbage strike. To Lydon punk was making do ""Wear the garbage bag for Gods sake"" he says. The other surviving band members dont do themselves any favors. Guitarist Steve Jones admits he was an oafish Lothario and petty thief; original bassist Glen Matlock thought the band should aspire to pop prominence like the Bay City Rollers; drummer Paul Cook was and remains a blank. The late Vicious gets plenty of screen time mostly from a disjointed 1978 interview with Temple not long before the bassists overdose. McLaren meanwhile is all but written out of the bands history as Lydon seizes credit for most of the ideas the former manager claimed for himself in ""Swindle."" Given the bands undying notoriety its music inevitably takes second billing. There are enough rare performance sequences in ""Filth"" however -- as grainy and doctored as they are -- to demand attention all over again for the bands colossal clamor. The Pistols self-immolation at San Franciscos Winterland is handled in a scant few scenes but one of them says it all. ""This is no fun"" Lydon mutters as though he were the only person in the room. For a man who laughs at everything it was clearly time to get out. -- Advisory This film contains nudity raw language and adult subject matter. James Sullivan ""THE FLINTSTONES IN VIVA ROCK VEGAS"" Comedy. Starring Mark Addy  Stephen Baldwin  Kristen Johnston  Jane Krakowski  Thomas Gibson  Alan Cumming  Joan Collins  Harvey Korman . Directed by Brian Levant . (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A wacky live-action visual style -- based on the famed Hanna-Barbera cartoon -- is half the fun of ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas."" But this comedy fast falls from interestingly loopy to tiresome. The predictable story and lame characters just dont hack it. Mark Addy (the chubby guy in ""The Full Monty"") stars as dim but good-hearted Fred Flintstone and Stephen Baldwin plays his more knuckleheaded gushy pal Barney Rubble. They team for romance with Kristen Johnston ( ""3rd Rock From the Sun"") as Wilma and Jane Krakowski (""Ally McBeal"") as Betty. Outlandish best describes the cheesy costumes and cluttered style in this ""prequel"" to ""The Flintstones"" the 1994 hit that starred John Goodman Elizabeth Perkins Rick Moranis and Rosie ODonnell. The film is loaded with dopey visual jokes and pop culture references -- a brontosaurus breaking wind a fast-food diner called Bronto King. Fred and Barney graduate from the Bronto Crane Academy as quarry equipment operators and head out to whoop it up with a hope to meet women. Wilma is a millionairess running away from awful parents (Joan Collins and Harvey Korman). She meets working-class Betty a diner carhop. The boys meet the girls and before long theyre on a wild weekend trip to a hot casino operated by villain Chip Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson of ""Dharma amp; Greg""). Hes scheming to win over Wilma and is miffed that shes hanging with Fred. Threaded through the story is an alien character named Gazoo (Alan Cumming) on a mission to study the mating habits of earthlings. Most of the jokes are adult in tone and will sail over the heads of the very young. References to homosexuality for example probably will baffle most grade-schoolers as will a satire of Mick Jagger as a hopeless rake. Peter Stack ..
