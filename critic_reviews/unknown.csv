With Mark Strong Sanaa Lathan and Luke Wilson - Director Mark Elijah Rosenberg (130) R Profanity. Playing at AMC 34th Street 14. Actor Mark Strong is regularly in an orbit of his own -- and thats certainly the case in his sci-fi drama ""Approaching the Unknown."" But it would be that much better if he got more help in this indie about a solo journey to Mars to prepare for a future colony. The Brit plays an American astronaut trying to hold his spacecraft together amid a succession of potentially life-threatening technical problems that could force him to scrub the mission. What connection he has to Earth a place he clearly doesnt seem to miss is his mission control contact played by Luke Wilson. Broadway veteran Sanaa Lathan is criminally underused in what amounts to a glorified cameo as an astronaut on a similar mission after weeks behind. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sequel provides some comic relief Space Jammed Mark Strong stars in ""Approaching the Unknown."" Rookie writer/director Mark Elijah Rosenberg a New York product makes serviceable use out of a cramped set in which virtually the entire film is set. ""Approaching the Unknown"" would be more of a solid premise if it were not touching down so close to last years ""The Martian"" with its similar themes bigger effects budget and superior script. So it falls on the velvety voice Strong himself much like his character to salvage the mission and plow through the overly philosophical dialogue. Hes not helped by a ridiculous deux ex machina resolution that should have been jettisoned into deep space.

Credit Mary Cybulski/Vertical Entertainment ""Approaching the Unknown"" cant avoid comparisons with ""The Martian"" from last fall. Both movies feature a solo astronaut (Mark Strong here Matt Damon in that Ridley Scott film) who fends off probable death with Rube Goldberg solutions. In this case the problems begin long before Mars is reached.But if the movie is often derivative -- there are also echoes of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" both adaptations of ""Solaris"" ""Moon"" ""Interstellar"" and Epcot -- the tense scenario can withstand repetition and seeing it executed on a lower budget with modest effects carries its own interest. (This is the feature directing debut of Mark Elijah Rosenberg who founded the outdoor screening series Rooftop Films.)Mr. Strong plays Capt. William D. Stanaforth who believes he has seen enough of Earth. He is stubbornly nihilistically private Before his Mars mission to perfect a device that produces water from dirt he ventures into the desert alone. (You would think his success would solve this planets water problems but word doesnt seem to have gotten around.)Stanaforths individualism at times puts him at odds with mission control (Luke Wilson plays his friend there) and colleagues (Sanaa Lathan Anders Danielsen Lie Charles Baker). If ""Approaching the Unknown"" isnt entirely satisfying Mr. Strong reaches high with his portrayal of the unraveling of a man who believes survival is a matter of engineering.BEN KENIGSBERG""Approaching the Unknown"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Language that is still milder than what death millions of miles from Earth calls for.

"Mars-bound Approaching the Unknown is a stirring journey - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Mars-bound Approaching the Unknown is a stirring journey Mark Strong Vertical Entertainment Mark Strong stars in the mission-to-Mars drama ""Approaching the Unknown."" Mark Strong stars in the mission-to-Mars drama ""Approaching the Unknown."" (Vertical Entertainment) Gary Goldstein It would be easy to dismiss the mission-to-Mars drama ""Approaching the Unknown"" as a ""The Martian""-lite except unlike last years Matt Damon hit theres little thats light about this essentially one-man show. In fact its a rather serious meditation on space exploration and such big-picture concepts as life and death. In its own compact budget-conscious way its quite a stirring if low-key journey. British actor Mark Strong (""The Imitation Game"") is excellent as the very American astronaut Capt. William Stanaforth whos on a 270-day ""one-way"" trip to colonize the Red Planet. Most of the action takes place inside Stanaforths ship the Zephyr as he maintains the spacecraft practices daily routines makes journal entries (heard in voiceover) and interacts via video chats with vigilant mission control contact Louis ""Skinny"" Skinner (Luke Wilson) and Emily Maddox (Sanaa Lathan) another solo astronaut following at least for a time in Stanaforths path. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Alls well for our confident hero until his miscalculations result in a tainted water supply prompting ""Skinny"" to demand the captains immediate return to Earth. Instead the obsessed Stanaforth cuts off communication switches into survival mode and flies hellbent toward Mars. But will he make it?Under the steady hand of writer-director Mark Elijah Rosenberg tension and pathos build slowly sweeping us along with the captains fraught yet hopeful exploration. Crisp cinematography by Adam Newport-Berra strong production design by Steven Brower and deft visual effects round out this intriguing adventure. -------------Approaching the UnknownMPAA Rating R for languageRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesPlaying Laemmle Royal Theatre West Los Angeles; also on VOD Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Luke Wilson Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mini-approaching-unknown-review-20160531-snap-story.html#nt=oft03a-1la1,200,unknown3,unknown,latimes

Photo Paramount Home Media Distribution MOVIE REVIEW APPROACHING THE UNKNOWN Running time 90 minutes. Rated R (language). Captain William D. Stanaforth (Mark Strong) is on a solo mission to Mars where hell use his patented dirt-into-water contraption to lay the groundwork for a human colony. Unfortunately his machine fails en route; way more unfortunately he comes up very short compared to Mark Watney the red planet-stranded astronaut played with such humor and energy by Matt Damon in last years ""The Martian."" Claustrophobic space films certainly dont have to be funny but writer/director Mark Elijah Rosenberg fails to convey any real psychological chills either with this portrait of an obsessive adventurer banging away at his imperfect machine. Luke Wilson as Stanaforths ground control buddy ""Skinny"" is a foil for all of us as he tries to ascertain what the hell is going on up there and why.

Trouble ensues. Strong is good but there are slow patches.Mark Strong plays an astronaut in ""Approaching the Unknown.""(Photo Prodigy Public Relations)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 out of 5 starsA man on an historic mission to Mars runs into trouble along the way when ... stop me if youve seen this before.Of course youve seen this before. You saw it last year sort of in ""The Martian"" when Matt Damon got stranded on the Red Planet and in his words scienced the (expletive) out of it. Youve seen it many times. Mars holds a great fascination for us evidently our nearest planetary neighbor full of secrets and mysteries -- yet rarely are the journeys and visits smooth in either direction.Mark Strong plays an astronaut in ""Approaching the Unknown."" (Photo Prodigy Public Relations)Thats the case with ""Approaching the Unknown."" Mark Strong plays Capt. William Stanaforth an astronaut who invented a reactor that basically turns dirt into water. This would make life on the long-distance flight to Mars possible and potentially life on the planet sustainable.RELATED The big guide to summer moviesBut theres a catch. This is not a round-trip flight. Whereas in ""The Martian"" the suspense is in trying to get Matt Damon home Stanaforth will be not be coming back and he knows it. Yet he sees this not as a death wish or a fatal mission. Instead its the greatest opportunity in the history of science.Depends on your point of view I guess. He sums it up ""Nothing lives there. Nothing has ever died there. But Im going to bring it to life.""Another astronaut will follow but we spend most of the film with Stanaforth inside the capsule. We also see and hear from ""Skinny"" (Luke Wilson) at mission control who checks in regularly to see how Stanaforth is doing. The two go way back; in flashbacks we see the headstrong Stanaforth determinedly testing out his water reactor in the desert almost dying in the process (he refused to take water insisting on generating it with his contraption). Skinny is the first person who meets him on his triumphant walk out of the desert.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your devicePart of the challenge is the trip itself the isolation the boredom. We see this played out when Stanaforth docks with a space station for supplies along the way. The two astronauts there are hollow broken. Why? The length of the trip? Are they just tired of each other? At one point one of the other astronauts tells Stanaforth he should abort his mission. What the resolute Stanaforth asks incredulous? Just kidding ha-ha. But the laughter is nervous unsure.Again there wouldnt be much of a movie if Stanaforth simply rocketed on landing safely and setting up shop. Without giving too much away there are problems.Of course there are problems.Writer and director Mark Elijah Rosenberg paces things patiently which in some cases is a polite way of saying there are boring stretches. Strong is a tremendous character actor bringing charisma strength and wit to a variety of roles -- someone who typically appears in supporting roles. Here he gets his shot at a lead role and as great an actor as he is at times its hard not to look around for someone else. (Turns out Damon is a movie star for a reason.)MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestBut the performance is strong no pun intended. It could have used more humor -- Strong can handle that too -- and some of the big metaphysical set pieces look a little like computer screen savers from the late 90s. (Fractals)""Approaching the Unknown"" (was ""Slouching Toward Mars"" taken?) is a small film ultimately basically ""The Mark Strong Show."" There are worse things. But credit Rosenberg for tackling the big ideas. If he bit off a little more than he can chew so be it.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet With his chiseled jawline hawkish looks and shaved head astronaut William Stanaforth (Mark Strong) brings to mind an intrepid 1950s spaceman depilated by decades of cryogenic sleep. He is hurtling toward Mars in a cramped spacecraft with a cargo of metaphors for futility and persistence his one-way mission part early Space Age idealism part death wish. Alone in space he keeps fit with a rowing machine even as his water purifier fails promising death by dehydration before he can set foot on the arid Red Planet. He is going there to start a base for future astronauts to be followed a few weeks later by Maddox (Sanaa Lathan). This mission--the first people on Mars sent separately never to return--doesnt make a lick of sense except as a part of a strained allegory for man the unknown and whatever else really serious sci-fi movies are supposed to be about. Set largely in Stanaforths spacecraft Approaching The Unknown sometimes feels like an ersatz The Martian though it was filmed before Ridley Scotts hit NASA-thon from a script that was already kicking around screenwriting labs when Andy Weir started serializing his novel online. But while the two films share key ingredients (Mars survival a problem-solving engineer etc.) the humorless ruminative mood of writer-director Mark Elijah Rosenbergs low-budget debut is a far cry from The Martians gung-ho paeans to teamwork and classroom science. Too high-minded to ever stoop to suspense or fun Approaching The Unknown is almost completely interiorized unspooling in voice-over narration that sounds like a writing exercise that got out of control. Initially Strongs deep voice lends it a shade of pulpy fatalism ""Mars is just a tiny dot in the sky 40 million miles away. Nothing lives there. Nothing has ever died there."" But by the end hes saying things like ""Our bodies are more space than matter. What keeps us solid? Why dont we dissolve?"" No theme or parallel is ever lost on Stanaforth a psychologically absent character who exists to comment on his own significance. As though trying to create depth via optical illusion the movie has him mostly interact with characters who are literally flat and insignificant communicating with the astronaut through little glitchy video screens. Stanaforths spacecraft is a womb where he gestates during the nine-month journey to Mars; a self-made prison where he bides his time dressed in a jumpsuit patterned with faint stripes; a primitive cave where he grows a Stone Age beard as he fashions makeshift tools to fix his failing life support system; etc. etc. Surrounded by uncertainty and defeat he keeps on because thats what symbolic figures do. At least Approaching The Unknown has the look of thoughtful sci-fi down from the tin-can interiors that suggest humanitys smallness more than the vastness of the cosmos to the practical special effects made with spaceship models and glass tanks of glycerin powder and dye. Rosenberg quotes Solaris and 2001 A Space Odyssey with misplaced confidence--the former during a stop at a space station of failed experiments the latter whenever possible. But like so many movies committed to ""seriousness"" as an aesthetic it has an innate charm factor typified by Strongs one-note performance his eyes locked in cosmic contemplation as though it were a dissociative thousand-yard stare. The final image speaks to the movies handmade appeal Stanaforth outfitted in a goofy-looking hunchbacked EVA suit plodding through a suspiciously terrestrial-looking alien landscape to the magnificent sound of tinny synth strings.

But Approaching the Unknown operates on a much smaller and more philosophical scale -- and is ultimately more satisfying. Captain William D. Stanaforth (Mark Strong) has volunteered to take a one-way trip to the angry red planet to prepare it for further colonizers but disaster strikes a few months into the flight. We never leave his point of view; there are no scenes back on Earth showing the planet banding together to bring the hunky spaceman home. His Mission Control buddy Skinny (Luke Wilson) is seen entirely via computer screen and other than occasional flashbacks as well as a stopover at a space station populated by two broken men who urge Stanaforth to abort his mission because life in space sucks the majority of the film is just Strong in a few cramped sets.
