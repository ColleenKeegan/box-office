Following the success of A Serious Man and No Country for Old Men the brothers have adapted a book which in 1969 inspired a decent but only mildly entertaining film that was in thrall to the vanity of John Wayne. Here they give back to that tale the same grit that attracts young teen Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) to the grizzled louche US Marshal Reuben Rooster Cogburn.Mattie is a pragmatic and determined young girl with a maturity way beyond her years. She arrives in a small town where her father was recently murdered and her mission is simple to hire a man to help her track down the killer. The sheriff recommends Rooster as the meanest option and thats enough. She ignores Roosters rudeness and drinking and stalks him until he agrees. Its the beginning of an oddball Platonic romance although the Coens ditch the explicit admiration of Roosters she reminds me of me line from the 1969 film. Theirs is a testy partnership that thaws until they reach a lasting bond.The opening shot of Matties father lying dead outside a tavern lit only by the light from the porch sets the scene for the Coens attractive yet no-nonsense spin on this tale. It also establishes the films look. Before Mattie and Rooster head into the wild the films colours range from oatmeal white and sackcloth brown to urine yellow. Once outdoors Roger Deakinss photography honours the barren wintry landscape but holds back from romantic longing. There are two montage sequences of journeys over land and thats enough to establish the epic nature of the story and the place.Bridges is laidback irascible and mumbling as Rooster and all the better for it. But the Coens trump card is Steinfeld. Thirteen at the time of filming shes a revelation. She plays Mattie as hard but not cold and is smart enough to show the chinks in her armour. Matt Damon takes the Glen Campbell role as LaBoeuf and plays it much less pretty as the Texas Ranger who joins Mattie and Rooster in their horseback hunt.The Coens have made a western that assumes a pleasing position  between stately and earthy. Theres plenty of black humour and the brothers dont ignore the grim realities of danger and death but this is no The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada. They scrimp on neither warmth nor wit. Theres love too for the values language and landscape of the time and as such its a fairly traditional film as stressed by Carter Burwells quietly monumental and wistful score. It could be the Coens most straightforward film but its also one of their best.

If they were wantin` to be buried proper they shudda got killed in the summer` a reference to the frozen ground of the indian territory where much of film takes place. The language of the film with its colourful nineteenth century verbosity is authentic and the Coens capture the spirit and the ethos of these dangerous time. The unpredictable shift in seasons . . . one moment winter next moment summer . . seems to reflect the shiftiness of the many of the characters . . who are impressively capable of humour at times of extreme stress . . .( probably due to the imbibing of prodigious amounts of whisky. What is also impressive is the films refusal to settle for the sentimentality of the likable music score opting for a realistic denouement which is strangely moving. The acting is committed and all involved should be congratulated on managing to become creatures of the 1870s American. where despite the harshness of the times honour and integrity were still to be found.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 15 2011Andy SFeaturedA wonderful if flawed Western with a fabulous turn from Jeff Bridges and debutant Hailee Steinfeld who puts in a stunning performance eager to avenge her fatheraEUR(tm)s murder. As usual with the Coens there are some surreal moments but overall it was pretty coherent funny and enjoyable. The flaws though include Bridges muffled dialogue (thank God for subtitles) no reference to the girlaEUR(tm)s Indian heritage and the ending was rather rushed and unsatisfying. However Barry Pepper nearly steals the entire thing with a fantastic creepy appearance as a filthy looking outlaw but Josh Brolin was wasted and Matt Damon possibly mis-cast. Why do directors think heaEUR(tm)s worth it? Get Guy Pearce instead Overall a decent 4/5.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 24 2011prettyvintagethingsFeaturedExcellent film.Superbly acted and was enjoyed with my 13 year old son.Acting and story were excellent.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 24 2011prettyvintagethingsFeaturedExcellent film.Superbly acted and was enjoyed with my 13 year old son.Acting and story were excellent.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 23 2011chris jacksonFeaturedgot bored  what was the fuss aboutFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 8 2011the nativeFeaturedAs a person who grew up in Ft. Smith and is familiar with the court records of this time period I am amused to see comments that the film is not realistic since Portis lifted most of the incidents and dialogue straight out of the court records and diaries of the US Marshalls who served the district and the film in turn follows much of the book word for word. New Mexico also does a good stand in for the Oklahoma Territory. The only thing missing is the southern drawl that characterized the speech of people who grew up in that part of Arkansas during that time period--oh and Matties frequent references to her Presbyterianism along with her subsequent career as a banker. This is not a parody folks this is very close to the real thing. Much better than the John Wayne buffoonery of the previous film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 6 2011TRUTHTELLER.FeaturedThe Coen brothers are really starting to irritate with their re-makes of excellent films. They actually had the temerity to remake The Ladykillers. The original True Grit was an excellent movie and won John Wayne an oscar. This movie is also an excellent film with a terrific performance from Jeff Bridges.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 5 2011N. KavalaFeaturedEntertaining. I was not bored. But everything stayed shallow suspended in a sort of mellow-glossy artificiality. Best aspect of the film for me was the antique American which meant I had to work to follow the dialogue. A good thing. Maybe I would have rather either realism (the film was not believable on just about any level) or out an out parody. This was very gentle parody. Of course every Hollywood movie is a parody. This is at least a classy one.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 3 2011CappybearFeaturedAfter all the ballyhoo I found this film slightly disappointing. Its as well Id read the book and seen the 1969 film otherwise I would have struggled with Jeff Bridges often inaudible delivery of his lines. Perhaps he should have had subtitles. Perhaps too the Coen Brothers should have taken fewer liberties with the book. On balance no better or worse than the John Wayne movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 2 2011BartlebyFeaturedThoroughly enjoyed this and have no complaint about the film at all. However I have found slightly troubling the way that critics and publicists have tried to diminish the earlier film. I just watched the original one a couple of weeks back and theres barely a cigarette papers width of difference between the plot and dialogue of both. Both were pretty faithful to Portis book. Of course the 2011 has grittier and grungier visual style but thats as much down to the way filmmaking fashions change as much as anything else. And Jeff Bridges is wonderful as Cogburn but dont let anyone say that John Wayne wasnt massively charismatic in the earlier one.

It was well made film everything sort of fell into place it did not feel too stylised and incredible cinematography by roger deakins that really tied the film together. But the ending where rooster rides off with mattie was kind of peculiar and took away some of the earlier gritty realism and I wonder if that was a deliberate move on the directors part from matties perspective possibly to suggest a feeling of being far-off and not quite all there as she completes her journey in a half-conscious state. I also felt that the musical score was somewhat forced for the purpose of provoking on the emotional level and was only there to make up for the lack of it in the film it did seem quite unnecessary in parts where I thought silence could have worked better but thats not to say of course that it was brilliant to listen too and the changes were spot on to suit the changes determined in the film but for a simplistic kind of story it seemed excessive. The film does kind of hint at the futility of revenge in a coens kind of way that is not too drawn out a lot is concealed from us and we are only shown the grit and the action that gives the film its direction. I would not give this film any less than a 4 and I cant put a finger on why but I just enjoy watching it it is refreshing different funny and light and just a great experience and I would not mind seeing it again.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 27 2011georgeFeaturedunusual story but simplistic and minimalistic in the sense that much was toned down to make the film as true as possible to the context laid out in the novel and essentially it remained authentic to that world; roosters character is not too drawn out to a point of exaggeration nevertheless jeff as rooster manages to engage our attention in his strong prescence on-screen. the little girl was totally convincing in her characterisation and it was interesting to observe her encounters with the different men. when the father dies the film is propelled into life unlike the 1969 version that felt the need to introduce the film with a backstory where we see the dad with mattie. in this film the father is dead right from the start and it is matties grit that keeps her grounded and firm in her principle resolution to avenge her fathers death. just to sound corny the film itself is rooted in true grit therefore the subdued emotion only seems appropriate for that were the film to have shown the father as living would have killed the impact that is made from the start and that becomes the cause of the film itselfFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 26 2011MoviegeekFeaturedI really dont understand the critical success of this film. Yes of course its very handsomely filmed but A) its all incredibly predictable both in terms of story and characters B) Most of the dialogue is pretty ludicrous (at least whatever you can understand from Jeff Bridges) C) Hailee Steinfelds character is the most annoying ever in fact they all are hence the audiences attachment to the is pretty low. D) the ending is terrible I think people are seeing something that its not there just because its a Coen Brothers film.

Shes a revelation however Matt Damon does manage to steal a few funny scenes from her. It could easily have done with another 15 minutes on the end or Matties fathers murder could have been portrayed at more length at the beginning as we dont really get a sense of the man for whom she is so driven to get justice. Theres a few irritating continuity errors but putting these little niggles aside this is an enjoyable film which Id recommendFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 24 2011SuttonFeaturedAn excellent film IaEUR(tm)m surprised by the negativity on here it does take a little while to tune in to Jeff BridgeaEUR(tm)s accent but once you have it is worth the (minimal) effort. Superb performances from all the leads great dialogue and a very humorous script. The cinematography was also excellent. IaEUR(tm)d give the film five stars but for the fact that the film is a re-make. This will be one of the films of 2011.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 24 2011trickergFeaturedAwful. I too would have walked out had I not been sitting in the middle of a row. Where did they get those actors? They sounded like they were off some Amish farm and all had some kind of speech impediment. There was no emotion conveyed to the audience at all - I felt nothing for any of the characters. There was a dreadful weather problem - how did the snow stay on the ground in the torrential rain - and the saddle not get wet? How could Maddie have dried off so quickly gettign out of the river? How did it start snowing from a startlit sky? And the story line It was about as exciting as watching paint dry. Glad I saw it half price.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 23 2011jessFeaturedCant understand all the negativity towards True Grit. Not all characters are made out to suit the audiences hearing level so tough luck if y couldnt make out Roosters dialogue. In my opinion this film was appealing and remarkably enjoyable I was taken right into that old western world people who couldnt engage with this film probably couldnt appreciate that. Coen brothers or not everything seemed to fit the atmosphere was right as were the raw and authenticity of the acting from the whole cast. it stands as a film in its own right so keep off from the comparisons with the 1969 true grit.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 23 2011blibFeaturedmoviegeekblog..Spot on I wanted to slap Hailee Steinfield. And Perchance I do believe I may or I may have not come to the conclusion but please if you would allow me to ask as indeed is my wont....Did everybody speak like they were auditioning for Twelth Night in the wild west?? Pretty sure Coen brothers could film a trip round Tesco and everybody would be wetting themselves to say how good it is.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 21 2011RussellFeaturedReverential nod at the values of the old West unusually for the Coens the film appears to be played completely straight.

I would have left earlier but was in the middle of a row...Sorry to say but this was dull and I was delighted when it finally ended. For a start Hailees character is totally unbelievable I could only make out about two thirds of what Jeff Bridges was saying I was not at all interested in the characters and frankly couldnt care less what happened to them. The only time Hailee showed some emotion was when the horse was shot and put out of its misery. Lucky horse.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 19 2011JohnSFeaturedI have to agree with the negative comments about True Grit. I felt let-down and disappointed expecting more realism from a modern re-make of a previous aEURoeclassicaEUR. I wanted it to be tenser aEURoedarkeraEUR and the characters to be more realistic and believable. For example how a rugged murderous outlaw could put his foot on MattieaEUR(tm)s neck threatening to kill her one minute and then invite her to breakfast the next left me dumbfounded. As was the way she casually walked into the outlawaEUR(tm)s camp and chatted with them like old friends. When Ned Pepper then tells Chaney not to touch the girl or else (why?) I gave up. This film is totally unconvincing. Matt Damon was miscast as the Texas Ranger. Bridges was very good apart from the mumbled lines that made the dialogue hard to follow which is a shame as the script is excellent in parts.

Today I feel as if there was consistently something essential missing and that maybe this film shows the Coen brothers limitations. There were moments when slips seemed to reach the screen; the outstanding one being Maddie reaching the far side of the river apparantly bone dry though wed seen her in the water up to her eyes. What about the montage of the trail in the middle of the film though with the constant changes of direction? Was it intended to indicate a winding route? In retropsect the impression was only of travelling through a small place in circles. The ending; the ride through the forest was a really bizarre muddle of ineptitude and cliche. We were surely meant to be moved by the final circus scene but the film is played and presented so much as a black comedy that it hasnt earned its spurs; it cant expect that were moved by it and winds up looking perfunctory. 3 stars but I dont know why quite so many.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 12 2011MikeFeaturedWhen a fortune is spent on advertising it usually means one of two things aEUR"" either the filmaEUR(tm)s excellent or a turkey. Surprisingly this is neither aEUR"" itaEUR(tm)s just mediocre. Jeff Bridges is inaudible in places and Hailee Steinfeld talks way too quickly. There are some humdinging continuity flaws my favourites being SteinfeldaEUR(tm)s gun managing to cock itself second time round in the early river scene and earlier when Matt Damon thrashes SteinfeldaEUR(tm)s behind immediately after sheaEUR(tm)s crossed the river (up to her neck in water) and SteinfeldaEUR(tm)s clothes are then mysteriously dry.

I hated Hailee Steinfeld throughout and found her totally unbelievable and not very likable. Nor did I find likable Matt Damon... I would have probably liked Jeff Bridges if I could understand what he was talking about. Between the thick accent and the fact that he was constantly mumbling I must have missed at least 1/5 of his dialogue. So without anyone to care about I was left watching the beautiful photography and listening to the nice soundtrack (however that felt like it belonged to a different movie). Sorry I was just bored bored bored right till the end when finally a couple of snakes make the tension rise for about a minute or so... After that back to old boredom (including some bad back-projection). Just because something has Jeff Bridges in it and its directed by the Coen Brothers doesnt make it good.

(See TIMEs 2010 Holiday Movie Preview.) On its publication in 1968 Portis comic Western was instantly recognized for its rare blend of popular appeal and high merit ""a lean but plucky novel"" a TIME reviewer wrote ""gilded with literary quality that can delight book lovers as well as bookkeepers."" Within a year Hollywood had adapted True Grit into a crowd-pleasing movie that plopped John Wayne into the role of U.S. Marshal Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn Matties one-eyed partner in pursuit of the murderer Tom Chaney. Playing broader than usual and investing a figure of autumnal majesty with some self-poking fun Wayne won a long-overdue Oscar for best actor. (See TIMEs 10 best movies of 2010.) Still Portis admirers rankled at the sanitizing of the many elements of the story at the demotion of Mattie to a supporting character attending Waynes cinematic coronation and at the transforming of Mattie from a girl at the portal of her teens to an elderly tomboy played by Kim Darby who turned 22 the week the film opened. In an act of literary restitution Joel and Ethan Coen have made a more faithful movie version. Rooster is now played by Jeff Bridges the star of their 1998 The Big Lebowski; the Dude replaces the Duke. Without unduly reducing the Rooster role the brothers have restored Mattie to the center of the action and cast 13-year-old Hailee Steinfeld as Portis diminutive female Ahab. To those who have fond or foul memories of the Wayne True Grit the Coens might be saying Youve seen the movie now see the book. So Mattie now relates the tale from the decades-later vantage of spinsterhood. As an Arkansas girl in the outlaw 1870s she embarked on her journey of revenge because she says ""My brother is a child and my mother is indecisive and hobbled by grief."" She chooses Cogburn for what she believes is his ""true grit"" though readers and viewers know from the start that no one possesses that virtue more than Mattie herself. ""I admire your sand"" acknowledges one of her adversaries using a word popularized by Mark Twain to refer to courage and perseverance. She is a genuine Old Testament heroine as dogged in her mission to find the killer of a family member as Waynes Ethan Edwards was in a similar fable of revenge John Fords more magnificent troubling and haunting The Searchers. Following Winters Bone and The Fighter the Coens True Grit is the latest in this years parade of films about smart decent preternaturally capable children who avenge or overcome their crazy or enfeebled mothers and outwit all the tough characters who stand in their way. Cloaked in the garb of realism these striving children are as much figures of fantasy as Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter. Taking Matties implacable resolve and improbable knowledge of legal lore at face value the Coens whip up a skillful entertainment that still leaves the viewer wondering why they spent a year of their lives on the project. The questions more often asked of the Coens are a perplexed ""Are they kidding?"" (apropos Burn After Reading) or with A Serious Man an annoyed ""Is this supposed to be funny?"" To the meager extent that one can read the minds of these delphic siblings True Grit seems to be an honest stab at transfering a beloved book as accurately as possible from page to screen. Can actors comfortably speak and audiences easily assimilate Portis ornate contraction-averse prose? The Coens present the novels dialogue more or less as written; indeed they revere it as Holy Writ. (""He is not my friend"" Mattie says at one point of Rooster. ""He has abandoned me to a congress of louts."") Its not Shakespeare but it requires in the listener a special attentiveness for full savoring; and thats a pleasure worth working for. The tense verbal comedy of Matties early negotiation with a Fort Smith merchant should win you over to this movies high linguistic wit. If not you may as well slip out of the theater and into Little Fockers. Oscar winners for the Fargo screenplay in 1997 and for best picture direction and screenplay in 2008 for No Country for Old Men the Coens found in Portis novel another parable of a stalwart soul who obsessively hunts down a murderer in a harsh climate. The brothers usual cool tone which lowers the temperature of any story they touch is appropriate to the wintry setting of the Oklahoma Indian Territory of the 1870s. Everyones bundled in heavy coats (one man wears a bearskin) as if in anticipation of a killing frost. Roger Deakins cinematography expertly evokes the chill in the hunters bones as they track their deadly quarry -- Tom Chaney who in Josh Brolins rendition turns out to be a creature as small and pitiable as his crime was grand and mean. The Coens also jettison the 1969 movies romance between Mattie and the third member of her small posse the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (pronounced la-beef) here played by Matt Damon. At first LaBoeufs interest in the girl wavers between the weirdly flirtatious (he has a mind to kiss her when he sees her in bed) and the parentally predatory (spanking her when she shows spunk by fording a river to join the pursuit). A righteous dude with jangling spurs whom Mattie initially pegs as ""a rodeo clown"" LaBoeuf eventually demonstrates his sharpshooting capabilities and his sweet respect for Mattie when in the films tenderest scene he bids her farewell. In some elements of casting the Coens stuck with actors who would evoke the 1969 version. Dakin Matthews as Col. Stonehill the merchant Mattie tangles with imparts the same wily bombast that Strother Martin brought to the first movie; and Barry Pepper as the leader of the gang Chaney has joined is a dead ringer for the 1969 films Robert Duvall. The books Mattie describes Rooster as being ""about forty years of age"" but Wayne was 63 when his True Grit was released; Bridges is 61. For most of his exemplary career he has been a vessel of nuance and agreeability not the broad strokes of a crowing Rooster. Bridges can duplicate the grandeur of personality that was Waynes birthright but its still counterfeit -- more an acting job than a proud expression of self. Only toward the end as Rooster fulfills a treacherous mission of mercy does Bridges finally earn the role; and even here hes out-acted by ""Little Blackie"" the horse hes riding. Is there an Oscar for Best Supporting Equine? In a few of her scenes Steinfeld rushes through the Portis-Coen dialogue as if it were an oration she had memorized for school. Even here though she imparts an imposing gravitas interrupted only by the half-smile she flashes as yet another tough guy underestimates her strength of spine. The Coens could have chosen a valued name brand like Dakota Fanning or Saoirse Ronan. Instead they cast a 13-year-old in her first big role. Steinfeld -- a striking smiling willowy teen who exudes a kind of naive chic -- fully resides inside the skin of a 19th century character very different from her. As Mattie shes all business possessed of a willful poise that first infuriates and then impresses all those raw men whose help she needs in fulfilling her mission. Though billed a demeaning fifth in the credits and proposed as an Oscar candidate in the supporting-actress category Steinfeld is the heart star and glory of True Grit. If some of the films laggard middle passages make you wonder why the Coens took on this enterprise you should realize by the end that they discovered the movies reason for being as a celestial showcase for Hailees comet.

The first The Ladykillers (a noisy reimagining of the understated 1955 Ealing Studios comedy) was by almost any reasonable account the brothers worst film. True Grit is also arguably the Coens second Western following 2007s No Country for Old Men--by general consensus their finest work. It is perhaps fitting then that True Grit lies squarely between these two poles of their career a fine but middling production by the duos elevated standards. The 1969 version of True Grit directed by Henry Hathaway won John Wayne his only Oscar in the role of Arkansas marshal Rooster Cogburn; the Coens remake would seem intended to do the same for Jeff Bridges if not for the fact that it comes a year too late. Indeed there are notable similarities between Cogburn and Crazy Hearts Bad Blake the role that earned Bridges his Academy seal-of-approval last year both are ornery likable drunks who were exceptionally good at their chosen professions until they decided to set up residence in a bottle. Yes Cogburn is a killer and Blake a singer but that is merely the difference between Western and Country amp; Western. MORE ON COEN BROS. Christopher Orr Noir in a Chinese Desert Zhang Yimou Remakes the Coen BrosRoss Douthat The Moral Vision of the Coen BrothersEd Koch Coen Brotherss Movie Is ""Seriously"" Good As in the earlier film and the Charles Portis novel on which it is based Cogburn is hired by a headstrong 14-year-old girl Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) to track down and punish Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) the lowlife who murdered her father and fled into Indian territory. Mattie also demands improbably but immovably that she accompany Cogburn on the mission. They are intermittently accompanied in their vengeful endeavor by an epicene Texas Ranger named La Boeuf (Matt Damon) who wishes to see Chaney hanged for an unrelated infraction. They encounter the typical obstacles along the way snappish snakes unforgiving elements and a passel of auxiliary desperadoes (including Barry Pepper whose small but excellent performance--in a role played by Robert Duvall in the original--is bested only by that of the makeup technician responsible for his terrifyingly snaggled dentition). But in classic Western tradition the tale is largely a journey from point A to point B from crime to punishment. There are heavy echoes of Unforgiven of Lonesome Dove and of the countless Westerns they were themselves echoing. After the triumph of No Country for Old Men the Coens would seem a perfect match for such material for the stark unforgiving expanses of the Old West and the laconic antiheroes who prowled it. The problem is that while the former is in gorgeous evidence the latter are nowhere to be found. Cogburn Mattie and La Boeuf are all inveterate talkers and hardly a minute goes by without the airing of some boast dispute or complaint. The precocious Mattie is a particular problem her hyperactive patter awkwardly recalling that of Nicolas Cages H.I. McDunnough in Raising Arizona and George Clooneys Ulysses Everett McGill in O Brother Where Art Thou. (In the 1969 film Mattie was played by 21-year-old Kim Darby; Steinfeld by contrast is actually 14 rendering her a more plausible child but paradoxically a less plausible protagonist.) I held out hope for the appearance of Josh Brolin who elevated taciturnity to an art in No Country but despite his above-the-title billing his role in the film is largely perfunctory. Ultimately its hard to shake the sense that the Coens opted to remake the wrong Western. True Grit is a sentimental tale at least by the standards of the genre and the Coens are not--to put it mildly--sentimentalists. They restore a few of the more somber elements of the Portis novel but this is still the story of a plucky girl and her grizzled companion and as such perhaps best suited to the ingenuous tone of the 1969 version. Thats not to say the Coens film is without its strengths a good if slightly familiar performance by Bridges; a nice customarily modest turn by Damon who may be the most versatile star working today; and of course the brothers usual technical prowess. But the real reason to see the film is the work of the Coens regular collaborators cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer Carter Burwell who supply the visual and auditory landscapes that are True Grits most notable achievement. (Burwells evocative score which consists largely of delicate variations on the hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms""--and recalls his magnificent appropriation of ""Limericks Lamentation"" in Millers Crossing--is alone worth the price of admission.) Deakins has shot every Coen brothers movie since 1991s Barton Fink (along with such beautiful films as The Shawshank Redemption The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and Revolutionary Road); Burwells fruitful collaborations with the Coens date back further still all the way to their 1984 debut Blood Simple. Neither man I am dismayed to report has ever won an Academy Award. It seems unlikely that this oversight will be corrected by as modest a vehicle as True Grit. But one can dream.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 24 2010 1201 a.m. ET The patch is on the other eye and the boot is on the other foot in the Coen brothers remake of ""True Grit"" with Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn. Its the role that won John Wayne his only Oscar four decades ago and Mr. Bridges fills it with boozy panache. Joel Coen and Ethan Coen fill the film with self-conscious good humor--hey its the Coen brothers--and the charmingly old-fashioned locutions of the Charles Portis novel. Remaking a cherished movie is not to borrow a fancy phrase from the dialogue malum in se--wrong in itself--but there are always losses along with the changes and gains. The main loss here is inevitably innocence. Mattie Ross the 14-year-old heroine originally played by Kim Darby is no longer sweet-faced and freshly scrubbed. Shes gimlet-eyed grimly purposeful and precocious in a distinctly modern youre-not-the-boss-of-me way and she delivers her lines like a train conductor with too many stations to announce. Watch a clip from ""True Grit"" starring Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Josh Brolin Barry Pepper and Hailee Steinfeld. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Mattie and her quest to avenge her fathers murder have gained new prominence from the filmmakers decision to use the structure of the book which Mattie narrated rather than to emulate the earlier film which was dominated by John Waynes stirring larger-than-life presence. Yet the heavier load of intricate language is too much for young Hailee Steinfeld. You can see and hear her struggle during a deliciously funny stretch of hard bargaining in which Mattie outwits a pompous horse trader named Stonehill. Ms. Steinfeld who is Matties age does her dogged best but the scene works as well as it does largely because the character actor Dakin Matthews who plays Stonehill brings a lifetime of skill and experience to the encounter. (Strother Martin played the role just as skillfully in the original version.) When it comes to life experience the movies star is no slouch either and he couches it in zestfully comic terms. ""Ive grown old"" this Rooster declares in a growl more gravelly than Popeyes. So he has but Mr. Bridges hasnt; hes grown for the occasion a beer belly a bibulous sneer a lecherous leer and a broader-than-life comic style thats lovely to watch whether Rooster is taking errant potshots at bottles under the influence of too much whisky or confronting four adversaries who mean to blast him off his saddle (in a showdown thats set up lazily and staged perfunctorily). Matt Damon is the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf who lets Mattie know that hes a Ranger with an amusingly vain flip of his lapel to reveal his badge. On the whole though LaBoeuf adds up to less than the sum of his sometimes fumbling and sometimes heroic parts. Josh Brolin who starred in the Coen brothers ""No Country for Old Men"" plays a minor role here as Tom Chaney the man who killed Matties father. Roger Deakins did the cinematography with mixed results. Many of the classic Western exteriors looked washed out and indifferent when I saw the film on a big screen and just as much so later on a DVD screener. But his masterful interiors with their darkly sumptuous tones give the movie a resonance that goes beyond its galloping action and cantering comedy. ENLARGE A scene from The Illusionist. Sony Pictures Classics The Illusionist Sylvain Chomets animated feature began as an act of devotion and became a thing--a fable a tone poem an elegy--of ethereal beauty. Its a movie about melancholy though much more than that and it asks for more than the usual suspension of disbelief. Savoring its singular bittersweetness--and accepting its imperfections--requires suspending customary expectations of story and narrative pace. And of dialogue since many scenes suggest a silent film. Whats left to savor then? Exquisite images poignant humor echoes of cinema history and a sense of having watched genuine magic. As the title indicates the hero is a magician an aging Frenchman called Tatischeff who is struggling to survive on the shrinking music-hall circuit of the late 1950s. (This film has no connection with the Edward Norton film of the same name.) Tatischeff was the real name of the late Jacques Tati the French actor who created the bumbling Mr. Hulot and therein lies the devotional link. Mr. Chomets astonishing debut feature ""The Triplets of Belleville"" had included by way of homage a clip from Tatis 1949 ""Jour de Fete."" Thanks to Tatis daughter Sophie the animator was able to make ""The Illusionist"" from a script that Tati had written but decided not to film in the belief that it was too personal probably because of its implicit father-and-daughter relationship. Watch a clip from the animated film ""The Illusionist."" Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. In everything but name the magician of the film is Mr. Hulot. He moves like Hulot walking in sequential teeters and bows like Hulot with courtesy tinctured by servility. Like Hulot hes an outsider but Tatischeff is also painfully a loner moving from Paris to London and then points north in search of a livelihood. He finds one for a while in Scotland where he meets Alice a young chambermaid who is innocent enough to believe that his magic tricks are the real thing. Their relationship is chaste and all but wordless the filmmaker embraces Tatis minimalist approach to dialogue and music even though their absence gives the troubling impression of dramatic emptiness. (The impression subsides when you give yourself over to the gorgeous images.) Far from prestidigitating his way out of penury the illusionist secretly takes odd demeaning jobs to provide Alice with shelter and pretty clothes. And the love between them remains unstated. Mr. Chomet expresses his story almost exclusively in hand-drawn paintings that move wonderfully nostalgic watercolors of a vanished era. When ""The Illusionist"" is funny the jokes are fragile (scattered feathers mistaken for snow Tatischeffs feral rabbit the magicians fear of rabbit stew). When its lyrical the images shimmer with inner life (Edinburgh as an enchanted city). At one point Tatischeffs deepening sadness prompts him to insist that ""magicians do not exist."" But they do. This movie proves it. Somewhere Sofia Coppolas first feature film in four years is very much about a father and daughter and here again not much at all about overt action. (Like its driver the black Ferrari in the title sequence is going around in circles.) Theres so little action for so long that ""Somewhere"" could qualify as a clinical test for attention deficit disorder; if you stay with it you dont have it. I stayed with it despite the glacial pace maybe because Bill Murrays torpor in Ms. Coppolas ""Lost in Translation"" paid off brilliantly and this hero a disconsolate movie star played by Stephen Dorff is nothing if not torpid at the outset. Whats more Im glad I did. ""Somewhere"" eventually finds humanity--a man you really care about--in the midst of its precious milieu. Mr. Dorffs Johnny Marco recently separated from his wife is holed up and contemplating his life or at least his navel and broken wrist at the famously seedy Chateau Marmont Hotel on the Sunset Strip. Nothing much happens unless youre inordinately interested in pole dancers--Johnny is not--until his daughter Cleo shows up for a visit; shes played with infectious energy and effortless grace by Elle Fanning. Its easy to speculate that the loving Cleo and the frequently absent Johnny are stand-ins for Ms. Coppola and her own famous father but ""Somewhere"" neednt be seen as a film a clef. The movie stands on its own terms as a slow-burning drama of life in a Hollywood purgatory where you can not only check out but leave. Watch a clip from ""Gullivers Travels"" starring Jack Black Jason Segel and Emily Blunt. Video courtesy of 20th Century Fox. Gullivers Travels In my travels Ive seen Roman ruins Greek ruins and Byzantine ruins but Ive never seen a ruin like this live-action version of ""Gullivers Travels."" Jack Black as a wannabe travel writer named Lemuel Gulliver hustles himself a boat trip to the Bermuda Triangle and finds himself in Lilliput. The 3-D is cheesy (2.2-D at best) the gags are gross (Gulliver urinates on an 18th-century palace to extinguish a fire) and the production abandons all hope of coherence when the hero fights a climactic battle with a giant robot out of ""Transformers."" What were they thinking? What were they smoking? What were they singing on the way to the bank? Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE The Big Lebowski (1998) Strictly speaking Joel and Ethan Coens now-classic comedy is an absurdist neonoir film about mistaken identity. But theres no reason to be strict about this big sweet teddy bear of an entertainment and no mistaking the identity of the actor who makes the whole thing so consistently likable Jeff Bridges in what might reasonably be assumed is the title role. He plays Jeff Lebowski or The Dude an amiable California stoner mistaken for Jeffrey Lebowski the Big Lebowski of the title an aging Pasadena millionaire (David Huddleston) in whose life and tortured loves The Dude is soon enmeshed. Mr. Hulots Holiday (1953) Innocent fun in a nearly silent classic that pays homage to the era of silent comedy. Jacques Tatis Mr. Hulot an eccentric stranger in his own land arrives at a seaside resort in his ancient sputtering car and carries a butterfly net at the ready. If you wanted to stretch a point you could call it social satire but this first of Tatis Hulot series--which includes ""Mon Oncle"" and ""Trafic""--is much more consistently and enduringly a succession of gently humorous sketches having to do with oddity and human frailty. The School of Rock (2003) Jack Black found his mojo in a movie that gives the lie to Norma Desmonds deathless remark about the pictures having gotten small. This joyous farce is a big deal and its star is nothing less than majestic as a scruffy irreverent rocker passing himself off as a pedagogue in a private school. Mike Whites dazzling script and Richard Linklaters ebullient direction are fully equal to the challenge of morphing Mr. Blacks Dewey Finn from a dissolute mooch into a madcap Mr. Chips who turns a bunch of rigid preteens into a rock band for the ages.

""Rooster"" Cogburn and Hailee Steinfeld is Mattie Ross in the Coen brothers new version of the Western ""True Grit."" By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED December 20 2010 at 1149 am | UPDATED May 5 2016 at 714 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Charles Portis 1968 novel ""True Grit"" is a quick and vigorous read with a heroine of surprisingly unyielding opinions. Her name is Mattie Ross. And when the near-mythic tale begins on the page -- and on-screen in Joel and Ethan Coens beautifully wrought version -- Mattie is no longer the 14-year-old girl she was when she solicited the help of a rough one-eyed U.S. marshal to avenge her fathers murder. ""True Grit"" opens with the voice of Mattie 25 years after the events setting the scene as flakes of snow drift down upon a body in a street. It is the saddest of snow globes. On a business trip her father was shot by his hired hand Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) a man of ill temper. Last year as the Coens ""A Serious Man"" headed into art houses the brothers were hopeful that their next film would be the Western ""True Grit"" with Jeff Bridges in the role of the marshal Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn. ""Charles Portis novel is a really great one"" they told The Denver Post at the time. But their film was not they emphasized going to be a redux of the 1969 movie which famously starred John Wayne as Cogburn singer Glen Campbell as a Texas Ranger and a tomboyish and impossibly aggravating Kim Darby as Mattie. The Duke won his first and only Oscar for the film. This version gets many of its loamy pleasures from Bridges performance. What a croak he gives Cogburns whiskey- and smoke-scuffed voice. Mattie gets an earful because Rooster is a chatterbox. Still it is not far-fetched to think of this adaptation as ""A Serious Girl."" With the aid of the Coen brothers spare aesthetic and righteous script newcomer Hailee Steinfeld brings a headstrong certainty to Mattie that echoes the authors portrayal of the Arkansas girl who arrives in Fort Smith to pick up her fathers body. She is a Bible-knowing Methodist. The movies opening quote ""the wicked flee when none pursueth"" is from Mattie by way of Proverbs. If 1969s Mattie was softened and secularized this one is sustained by the Good Book as well as buoyed by her class entitlement. She may be easy to say ""No"" to at first. Rooster does. And the Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf even threatens and makes good on a spanking. Matt Damon plays the prideful ranger who grudgingly joins Cogburn and Mattie in hunting Chaney. But it is Matties faith in a man of ""true grit"" that proves her own mettle. When Mattie asks the Fort Smith sheriff which U.S. marshal she should approach to track Chaney he runs through her options. Theres the gifted tracker. Theres the pitiless man. Theres the marshal who gets his quarry in the most law-abiding fashion. The Coens let the timing of Matties choice hint at her own capacity for payback. This ""True Grit"" makes the original almost unwatchable except as a curio although Coloradans may recognize the ""Indian territory"" Mattie traverses as our own Rocky Mountain West. Waynes film was shot in Colorado. In the new version Portis novel is returned to its proper locale the post-Civil War frontier where the James brothers raised such a nasty ruckus. (Jesses brother Frank makes an amusing appearance.) Its the west of the Missouri and Arkansas hollows hills and woodlands. Strikingly shot by the brothers go-to cinematographer Roger Deakins there is soft winter light and the amber hues of fires and lanterns. Most of Carter Burwells austere score is created out of the quiet strains of the church-pew beauty ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms."" During the final credits the hymn gets its twang and warble from singer-songwriter Iris DeMent. In a season of gifts her version is a sweet one.

The Coen brothers new Western True Grit with Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 22 2010 119 PM True Grit Only a wool-hatted fool would skip this movie. By Dana Stevens Also in Slate listen to the Culture Gabfest discuss True Grit. Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn inTrue Grit The Coen brothers make two kinds of movies ones that obsess over the existence of evil and ones that muse on it accept it merrily and plow on. True Grit (Paramount Pictures) is the second type which I tend to prefer. I fear this nimble seriocomic Western wont be recognized as the fine movie it is both because the Coens were so recently bathed in Oscar glory for No Country for Old Men and because critical opinion seems to prefer it when these smart Jewish boys from Minneapolis go deep and dark. A Serious Man their last film was a beautifully crafted puzzle that retold the Book of Job--or possibly Ecclesiastes--as a suburban domestic comedy. It was chilly smart bleakly hilarious and cinematically virtuosic to a near-pathological degree. But like much of their work it wasnt exactly a movie that offered itself up for the audiences love. True Grit does and some Coen brothers fans may think that makes it pandering or lightweight. I think it makes it wonderful. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The story of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) a 14-year-old girl in 19th-century Arkansas who hires a bounty hunter to avenge her fathers murder this version of True Grit hews more closely to the cult novel by Charles Portis than the 1969 adaptation starring John Wayne. Its most marked characteristic is its dialogue written in a peculiar archaic diction that for reasons I still havent fully understood never interferes with the movies emotional directness. Informed that another character has died Mattie observes gravely ""His depredations are over."" These characters none of whom seem likely to have had much education toss around words like braggadocio and remonstrate and contractions as a rule are eschewed. The effect is non-naturalistic but curiously convincing. Were not meant to believe that people in 19th-century America actually spoke this way only to accept that this is a world with its own formal (and often very funny) language and its own inscrutable moral code. Advertisement After her father is shot by the bandit Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) Mattie engages the notoriously ruthless marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to track the killer down in Choctaw territory where hes hiding out with his gang. Cogburn whom we first glimpse in a darkly comic courtroom scene is a hard-drinking one-eyed lout with an itchy trigger finger. He agrees to take Matties money for the job but she insists on riding along with him to make sure its done right. Along the way they hook up with LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) a Texas Ranger (as he proudly informs anyone who looks at him crosswise) whos also in pursuit of Chaney for a set of unrelated crimes. The three form an uneasy and unstable alliance Will Cogburn and LaBoeuf join forces to split Matties reward money? Will Mattie disappointed in Cogburns work ethic and tracking skills abandon him and ride on with LaBoeuf? The first hour and half or so of True Grit is as good as anything the Coens have ever done--a sweeping Western that like John Fords best films exposes the cracks in American myths of frontier justice and self-reliance. Roger Deakins rich earth-toned cinematography and Carter Burwells score which relies heavily on the period hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" give the film a solidly tooled feeling like a well-carved piece of wood. When Chaney and his gang show up near the end theres a momentary slackening in the narrative and I confess I found the climactic showdown a bit disappointing in its conventionality. But its followed by a gorgeously lyrical sequence that without revealing too much I can only say may mark the first time Ive ever shed tears in a Coen brothers movie. Hailee Steinfelds performance as Mattie Ross is sensational enough to deserve a whole paragraph rather than just an adjective or two. She was 13 years old when the movie was shot. (Think for a second about how together you were at 13.) Steinfeld is not only emotionally precise in her portrayal of this fierce conniving yet passionately just young girl; shes intellectually and verbally precise as well. Her line readings show both wit and a keen understanding of the scripts high-flown diction but they never sound studied or arch. Wherever the casting director dug this jewel up she should keep digging. Bridges and Damon are also in top form. Bridges looking even more grizzled and unwholesome than he did in Crazy Heart rolls his lines around in his mouth as if relishing a wad of chaw. Damon as funny as hes ever been milks a laugh from every utterance of his characters name which he pronounces ""LaBeef.""As usual the Coens pack the smaller roles--undertakers horse traders and assorted no-goodniks--with carefully chosen character actors whose faces look straight from an old tintype photograph. And as someone whos been put off by the brothers occasional sadism toward their audience I appreciated that there were only a couple of scenes featuring cover-your-eyes graphic violence. The movies only real Achilles heel may be the flash-forward coda that makes up its last few minutes ... but Im venturing into Choctaw spoiler territory here. Just saddle up and see it yourself.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Dec. 22 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Dec. 21 2010 153PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Roy Blount Jr. once wrote that Charles Portis the author of True Grit ""could be Cormac McCarthy if he wanted to but hed rather be funny."" Perhaps that might explain Joel and Ethan Coens decision to adapt Portiss best-known novel for the screen following their success three years ago with McCarthys No Country for Old Men. Though both films are westerns and have their share of sardonic humour and carnage True Grit is a much tamer offering wry rather than comic; melancholy rather than weighty. Though handsomely made and well acted the film never completely escapes the sense that its an exercise in genre excavation. The solemn edge was largely missing from director Henry Hathaways 1969 adaptation made the year after Portiss novel was published which famously gave John Wayne his only Oscar hamming it up as the one-eyed drunken marshal Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn. While the Coens arent exactly setting the record straight its easy to see why they were drawn to Portiss work with its regional setting and flavourful language blending Biblical homilies and quaint 19th-century American dialogue. An early verbal shootout takes place between 14-year-old Mattie Ross (the precociously poised Hailee Steinfeld) and a veteran horse trader (Dakin Matthews). A pigtailed hyper-articulate adolescent Mattie has come to the frontier town of Fort Smith Ark. to claim the body of her father murdered for two gold pieces and a horse by his hired hand Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). The movie is framed by her voice-over adult reminiscences and she warns us early that we are in for a lesson ""You must pay for everything in this world one way or another. There is nothing free except the grace of God."" Carter Burwells score based on 19th-century Protestant hymns underlines the theme of moral reckoning. After putting her fathers corpse on a train home to her mother Mattie collects some of his money and sets out to hire someone to bring his killer to justice. That leads her to the alcoholic notoriously trigger-happy Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) first heard growling from inside an outhouse as Mattie argues with him from outside the door. The Coen brothers are truer to the source material than the earlier movie was. Though Bridges also has outsized charisma (and a baritone rumble that seems to emerge like a series of barks from a mine shaft beneath his beard) he plays Cogburn as a muddled human being. Against his wishes Mattie insists on accompanying him on his trek from west Arkansas through the ""Indian lands"" (present-day Oklahoma) home to outlaws and outcasts. Travelling with them is a fastidious and vain Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who wants to bring Chaney back to Texas for another crime. The two men spar and jostle in masculine one-upmanship. They are not the strong silent types ""Im struck"" growls Cogburn ""that LaBoeuf has been shot brambled and near severed his tongue. Not only does he not cease to talk but he spills the banks of English."" The journey is only slightly less adventurous than Portiss sentences an episodic coming-of-age story that evokes The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in its parade of eccentric characters and grisly events. Eventually the wintry desert landscape is littered with corpses though most of the violence is swift and relatively bloodless. As usual the Coens visual elements are pristine. The contrasting colours in the fire-lit interiors are gorgeous while cinematographer Roger Deakins keeps the camera close resisting traditional panoramic views. Only in a climactic montage that depicts a ride back to civilization are we granted the classic western images -- a star-filled night and a galloping horse and rider silhouetted against the skyline. The images are conventional but liberating with an emotional momentum that too much of True Grit lacks.

Comments (2) click to enlarge True Grit Recommended Watch on Netflix Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2010 Charles Portiss wonderful comic novel True Grit (1968) had the combined fortune and misfortune of being instantly made into a John Wayne western which won the star his first Oscar and ultimately eclipsed the book. This remake by Joel and Ethan Coen is being positioned as a truer True Grit and though they take their own liberties with the plot and tone they preserve Portiss impeccably authentic dialogue which does more to conjure up the Arkansas of the 1870s than any period trappings. Theyve also returned the focus to Portiss poker-faced narrator a prim judgmental 14-year-old girl (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) who hires the drunken one-eyed U.S. marshal Rooster Cogburn to track down her fathers killer. Jeff Bridges manages to wrest Cogburn away from Wayne who made the character a repository for his own screen legend and Matt Damon is funny as Cogburns disgruntled trail partner a self-glorifying Texas Ranger.

Starring Jeff Bridges Hailee Steinfeld and Matt Damon. Directed by the Coen brothers. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The image of John Wayne riding with two guns an eye patch and his horses reins between his teeth still lives as part as Hollywood iconography. But it has been 41 long years since the original ""True Grit"" was made - time enough for another go at it. After all 1969 is to us what 1928 was to 1969 or to reverse it we are to 1969 what 2051 is to us so distant its presumptuous even to think about it. ""True Grit"" is the new Coen brothers movie for which they went back to the original source the novel of the same name by Charles Portis. This new version wallows in historically accurate filth relishes bad teeth and occasionally approaches situations with some distance and a hint of absurdity though not as much absurdity as you might expect from the Coens. For the most part ""True Grit"" is a regular Western - not a re-imagining of the genre or of the original movie but a straightforward and fairly engaging attempt to do it for real and do it right. If theres one big difference between this version and the old its in the attitude toward violence. The new version may be more graphic but it doesnt present violence as inevitable or necessary just ugly. What a far cry from the 69 version with director Henry Hathaway blasting triumphant Western music every time Wayne was about to kill somebody. Hathaways vision suggested that all this bloodletting was merely a symptom of a great nations growing pains and to him these violent men villains and heroes were part of some bigger-than-life mosaic. Hathaway respected even the bad guys while the Coens see even the good guys as messy deluded and faintly pathetic. This goes for Rooster Cogburn played by Jeff Bridges as a fat slob cunning but not too bright and definitely more than a hard drinker - more like a drunk not far from hitting bottom. Hes hired by Mattie a 14-year-old girl - here played by an actual 14-year-old girl Hailee Steinfeld - to bring the man who killed her father to justice. Of course if Rooster were to kill the guy outright she wouldnt really mind that either. Rooster sets out on the trail of the culprit joined at first by a fussy Texas Ranger played with sly humor by Matt Damon and by Mattie who has spunk. Along the way not once do the Coens pull back to show magnificent Western vistas that suggest an overarching order to the universe. The Coens are more Anthony Mann than John Ford. Their West is a great outdoors answer to film noir Los Angeles in which everything is murky and a pathway between two mountains is as discomforting as a blind alley. As in noir there are wise and quirky characters too Dakin Matthews is particularly memorable as a shady horse trader a role originally played by Strother Martin. For Rooster Bridges rolls out his ornery cuss mode and hes good at it though if hes going to play yet another countrified alcoholic in a single year I kind of wish hed sing ""Fallin amp; Flying"" again too. His achievement is not that hes better than Wayne - you cant really argue with the image of Wayne onscreen - but rather that when Bridges is up there Wayne doesnt cross the mind. For some reason the Coens eliminate most contractions from the dialogue giving it an artificial feel and the burden of this falls most strongly on young Miss Steinfeld. Still shes quite believable and appealing as a precocious and competent young lady all business and a little reminiscent in her authority and presence of the juvenile Natalie Portman in ""The Phantom Menace."" My only reservation about the movie not a serious one but a nagging one is that watching the film its hard to see why the Coens wanted to make it. Its a respectable entertaining Western but its not so radically different or innovative that their need to make it seems overpowering. I guess we should just assume that the Coens had a hankering to make a pretty good Western. So they did. -- Advisory Strong violence alcohol abuse.

Joe Neumaier Wednesday December 22 2010 400 AM Title True Grit A one-eyed marshal helps a girl find her father""s killer. With Jeff Bridges Hailee Steinfeld Matt Damon. Directors Joel and Ethan Coen (150). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.Joel and Ethan Coen are rare cinematic originals which masks how carefully distilled their films are. No matter the source -- gangster noirs cultural footnotes Homeric journeys Looney Tunes -- they bolster new ideas with classic structure and make the seasoned seem fresh.Their latest ""True Grit"" adapted religiously from Charles Portis 1968 pulp novel is a wonderfully entertaining beautiful Western drama that lets the quirks of the genre gallop freely as it keeps a tight rein throughout.John Wayne won an Oscar for his own version of quirky in the 1969 original as U.S. Marshal Reuben (Rooster) Cogburn a drunkard who called a mangy cat his relative and wore an eyepatch.In the Coens fable of 1870s retribution Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) is not a sideshow but a serious man. When 14-year-old Mattie Ross (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) hires him to find her fathers killer Cogburn heads with her from Arkansas to the Indian territory that would one day be Oklahoma. For part of the way a preening Texas Ranger named La Boeuf (Matt Damon) rides with them.Their adventure brings them to Chaney (Josh Brolin) and a scarred thug named Lucky Ned (Barry Pepper). The story builds slowly and is filled with character and the Coens and their longtime cinematographer Roger Deakins make every run-in and frontier snowfall feel haunted and poetic.Damon is sly and Steinfeld is sturdy yet the big question for most viewers -- does Bridges sit tall in Waynes saddle? -- is really like comparing a rifle and a six-shooter.The onetime Big Lebowski is always a delight and lets Rooster reveal himself to be (a bit) softer at first until he slowly pulls out the toughness. (Wayne the same age in the first movie as Bridges is now did it flinty then tender.)Bridges has moments in which Roosters croaky monologues are as full of nuance as the one eye hes left to work with. His sole peeper darts around closes in exhaustion and earns our affection while ""True Grit"" proves to be as funny and heroic as any other legend and tells an expert tale to boot. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review Coen Bros. stick to faithful retelling of True Grit | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMovie review Coen Bros. stick to faithful retelling of True Grit In choosing not to reinvent the wagon wheel with True Grit the Coen Bros. ironically seem radical by being conformists.Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie and Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn in the Coen Bros. True Grit remake.  (LOREY SEBASTIAN / PARAMOUNT PICTURES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Dec. 21 2010 True Grit (out of 4) Starring Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Josh Brolin and Hailee Steinfeld. Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 14A There is no knowing what is in a mans heart nor in the minds of Joel and Ethan Coen. When the brothers announced they were filming True Grit word was it would be different from the 1969 Henry Hathaway oater that won John Wayne his career-summing Oscar for Best Actor. ""It will be truer to the book"" is what we heard and thats partially true. The Coens are amazingly loyal to the dialogue and plot of Charles Portiss wry and wondrous source novel and they place more emphasis on 14-year-old avenger Mattie Ross than they do on flinty deputy marshal Rooster Cogburn. And its mainly to the good. The Coens deliver a film opening Wednesday of far superior technical brilliance to Hathaways and their casting choices range from smart (Jeff Bridges as the one-eyed Cogburn Matt Damon as Texas Ranger LaBoeuf) to pure genius (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie). Yet True Grit is also one of the least ""Coenesque"" of the brothers films. You look in vain for much evidence of their wicked humour. Its possible that in Portis they have found a writer whose acerbic wit exceeds their own and they have opted perhaps wisely not to tamper with it. But who really knows? Its also possible that the Coens simply love the story -- and there is much to love. Told from the memory of a grown-up but unrepentant Mattie its a Wild West payback saga with a difference an Arkansas teen who seeks to lay handcuffs or bullets on Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) the cowardly farmhand who shot her father dead for 150 a horse and two gold coins. Mattie leaves her mother and younger siblings home in Yell County to travel to the frontier town of Fort Smith which the Coens cinematographer Roger Deakins and production designer Jess Gonchor render as a study in unvarnished timber dust and despair. Winter is hard coming but not before the last men swing from nooses in the town square. She may not be much bigger than a corn nubbin as the irascible Cogburn will observe and her long pigtails accentuate her precocious youth but Mattie is not to be denied. After doing some hard trading over a horse deal her late father was saddled with she conscripts a reluctant Cogburn and allows tagalong LaBoeuf to journey with her to Indian country to track down Chaney. LaBoeuf wants to take Chaney back to Texas where hes wanted for shooting a senator. Theres big money in his Texas remittance dead or alive which Cogburn also finds appealing. But Bible-quoting and chest-thumping Mattie will settle for nothing less than the pure justice of Chaney in an Arkansas prison or grave. So sayeth Scripture ""The wicked flee when none pursueth."" The pursuit is soon afoot; the bodies rapidly pile up. The Coens are perhaps more serious about their work than they need be but its an admirable severity. They strip the story of the hammy excesses of Wayne save one eccentric note where Cogburn first encounters stubborn Mattie while hes ensconced on an outhouse throne -- could you ever imagine the Duke stooping to that? Bridges is otherwise right in tune with the mood of the remake making his eye-patched lawman more of a figure of menace than Wayne could muster. He lowers and adjusts his cadence to make every word uttered -- and there arent many of them -- really count. He ""loves to pull a cork"" almost as much as he loves to pull the trigger. Damon makes a fine LaBoeuf a welcome change from the amateur work by country singer Glen Campbell in the original. He retains LaBoeufs pompous manner yet he too really means business. Steinfelds Mattie is the real coup and the main reason for seeing this True Grit. Fourteen going on firecracker shes age appropriate for the role unlike original player Kim Darby who was 21 at the time of Hathaways filming. Steinfeld is like a young Ellen Page (how time flies) and it will be fascinating to watch how her career develops. Instructive too is Carter Burwells evocative score which works a repeating piano figure to mesmerizing affect. It radically alters the mood of True Grit a huge improvement from the rote western jangle and cornball crooning of old. Some identifiable Coens mirth would have been nice. The closest we get is a meeting by Cogburn and Mattie with a woodlands dentist/sawbones who travels while wrapped entirely in bearskin right down to the head and jaws. In choosing not to reinvent the wagon wheel with True Grit the Coens ironically seem radical by being conformists. Theres truth and beauty in their faithfulness though and a reminder never to presume too much about these sibling ciphers.

"Movie review True Grit - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review True GritThe Coen brothers clearly find a kindred spirit in Charles Portis. His novel is delivered in all of its savage beauty in this thoroughly entertaining movie.December 22 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Hailee Steinfeld plays Mattie Ross and Jeff Bridges plays Rooster Cogburn... (Lorey Sebastian Paramount...)No one is the same after encountering feisty fearless and plain-spoken Mattie Ross age 14 from near Dardanelle in Yell County Ark. Not the other characters in the Charles Portis novel she dominates and certainly not the filmmaking Coen brothers Ethan and Joel. The Coens corralled stars Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper and newcomer Hailee Steinfeld and came away with ""True Grit"" one of their most broadly entertaining films yet. Mattie has a habit of turning people around she really does. That bleak but completely delightful Portis novel in which a much older Mattie remembers the frontier West of the 1870s has been charming and disconcerting people since it was published in 1968. The key reason is the vim and vigor of Matties irrepressible narrative voice which more than one critic has compared favorably to Huck Finns. Yes its that good. The sentence that starts the book as well as the Coens superior film introduces us to both the story and that singular narrator ""People do not give it credence that a fourteen-year-old girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her fathers blood but it did not seem so strange then although I will say it did not happen every day."" That kind of a story has always attracted Hollywood and in 1969 the veteran Henry Hathaway directed a version written by Marguerite Roberts that softened the books ending. It featured Kim Darby as Mattie Robert Duvall and Dennis Hopper in villainous supporting roles and John Wayne as one-eyed Rooster Cogburn the U.S. marshal Mattie turns to in her quest for vengeance a role flamboyant enough to finally win Wayne the best actor Oscar. The Coens not known for softening anything have restored the originals bleak elegiac conclusion and as writer-directors have come up with a version that shares events with the first film but is much closer in tone to the book a think of the original crossed with Clint Eastwoods ""Unforgiven."" Clearly recognizing a kindred spirit in Portis sharing his love for eccentric characters and odd language they worked hard and successfully at serving the buoyant novel as well as being true to their own black comic brio. In this they had the help of their own formidable filmmaking skills and those of their experienced collaborators. Production designer Jess Gonchor and costume designer Mary Zophres have combined to create the sense of the West as a harsh hardscrabble place made up of wide open but unwelcoming spaces and towns without pity. If Lucien Ballard cinematographer on the John Wayne picture showed us a world that was lush and green as sharply shot by Coen regular Roger Deakins this West is visually arid an unsettling Big Empty where only bitterness and bile thrive. This setting is matched stride for stride by the cast with casting director Jo Edna Boldin nailing even the smallest speaking parts. The big names in the cast all do excellent work but the biggest surprise is all but unknown Steinfeld. Mattie is the films essential role and though Steinfeld is but 14 and without major feature experience (Kim Darby was 21 when she played in the original) she nails it handling the highly stylized language like she was born speaking it. Perhaps being 14 has helped Steinfeld helped her to intuitively connect with Matties no-nonsense stubbornness her drop-dead determination not to be pushed around when shes in the right. Introduced in Fort Smith Ark. distraught at the recent murder of her father shot in cold blood by the miscreant Tom Chaney (Brolin) this is a young person in search of true grit who discovers it among other places in herself. Determined to see Chaney dead and learning that he has fled to the Indian territories where only U.S. marshals can make arrests Mattie seeks advice on the best man for the job. When shes told that ""the meanest one"" is Rooster Cogburn someone who is ""a pitiless man double-tough and fear dont enter into his thinking"" she doesnt care that ""he loves to pull a cork."" This is the man for her. Rooster for his part doesnt know what to make of Mattie or her non-negotiable demand that she be taken along on the search for her fathers killer. As played by Bridges this is a primitive Paleolithic Cogburn shrewdness and cunning shining through his one remaining eye. He tries as the dour stockman Col. Stonehill (a wonderful Dakin Matthews) had tried earlier to out-talk Mattie but it is to no avail. Plus the cash money she offers a ""Im giving you the childrens rate"" he insists when she tries to negotiate a still lower rate a counts for a lot. A third wheel gets added to this party soon enough when a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf who is after Chaney for another crime joins their party. A bit of a bragger and more than a bit stuck on himself LaBoeuf is beautifully realized by Damon as someone whose Sharps carbine is envied but whose presence irritates all and sundry. It wouldnt be fair to recount the adventures these three experience except to say they are as thrilling as any reader of the dime novels that likely inspired Portis would expect. Carter Burwells music with its frequent referencing of the vintage hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arm"" is a key part of the experience. When Iris DeMents impeccable version of the hymn is heard on the soundtrack as the final credits roll its the perfect touch to end a film whose aim is always true. kenneth.turanlatimes.com True Grit MPAA rating PG-13 for some intense sequences of western violence including disturbing images Running time 1 hour 50 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSAG Contender Hailee Steinfeld of True GritJanuary 11 2011True Grit memories from Kim Darby and Glen CampbellJanuary 4 2011Hailee Steinfelds career saddles upDecember 21 2010Charles Portis True Grit story aims for revenge...December 19 2010The Coen brothers redo True Grit for their first westernDecember 12 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentTrue GritRooster CogburnCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-true-grit-20101222,0,7069951.story",200,truegrit13,truegrit,latimes

By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune December 23 2010 -- 242pm Lorey Sebastian Paramount Pictures An Arkansas frontier girl (Hailee Steinfeld) enlists a hard-bitten U.S. marshal (Jeff Bridges) to help avenge her fathers death in ""True Grit."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Rooster Cogburn is a red-nosed souse a bushwhacker a liar a failed businessman an unloved husband and father and a cheat willing to take money from a girl under false pretenses. And this peevish old coot is the hero of Joel and Ethan Coens rousing adventure ""True Grit."" Its a tonal mash-up no one but the Coens could deliver the finest most intelligent Western since ""Unforgiven"" with the funniest public hanging since ""Blazing Saddles."" In ""True Grit"" the Coens dial down the eccentricity and deliver their first classically made audience-pleasing genre picture. The results are masterful. Their love for traditional Wild West movies glows with a cinephiles breadth of knowledge and a fans mad crushes. With dazzling performances by Jeff Bridges and newcomer Hailee Steinfeld awe-inspiring cinematography and the Coens trademark moral paradoxes its sweet nostalgia subtly shaded with melancholy and peppered with dashes of black satire. Steinfeld plays Mattie Ross a starchy 14-year-old on a mission to avenge her slain father killed by tenant farmer Tom Chaney now a fugitive in the Choctaw Nation. To track Chaney through Indian territory she employs Cogburn a shabby U.S. marshal whose reputation for decisive though ethically questionable gunplay suits her purposes. Hard-headed Mattie expects the old lawman to obey her directives and heed her advice like any other employee. She is not one to be trifled with; an early chapter of the story shows her bartering with a canny old horse trader so skillfully she reduces the man to sputtering apoplexy. Mattie insists that Marshal Cogburn bring her along on the pursuit so she can savor their quarrys capture or death. The tracker sees her as a liability. A great part of ""True Grits"" charm is the friction between the blunt girl and unsentimental old man and the touching evolution of their mutual respect. Complicating matters is Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) a self-regarding blowhard pursuing Chaney on another matter. The two lawmen table questions of jurisdiction to ride together with Mattie in tow. Their travels take them through unsettled frontier where you might encounter a bear that turns out to be a man or a cadaver that turns out to be a vipers nesting place. Mattie takes it all in dispassionately dispensing prim moral judgments and viewing justice as an eye-for-an-eye exchange. One-eyed Cogburn with firsthand experience in such matters is more jaundiced. LaBoeuf a dandy whose buckskin fringe would be at home in a circus show is a vainglorious laughingstock. TRUE GRIT  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating PG-13 for intense violence and disturbing images. Villainous Chaney remains unseen until the end a nemesis built up by Mattie to the terrifying proportions of a Goliath. When we finally meet the man she has been hunting its one of this shrewd films best jokes. Our heroes carry the day of course but the manner in which they get their victory is carefully designed to make us feel conflicted about the whole affair. Retribution comes with a significant loss of innocence. The actors are exemplary. Bridges bring notes to his character weve never seen from him before. Hes tough as saddle leather yet comically pompous a gene-splice of grizzled Duke Wayne and W.C. Fields. You can believe he spilled a lot of blood -- hesitant men didnt survive to old age in those days -- and that a lot of hard drinking took the edge off dangers toll. Damon is a wonderful sport in a role that undercuts him at every turn. Brolins turn as the cowardly dope Chaney is delicious and Barry Pepper as a bandit leader evokes Lee van Cleef but with a touch of sound leadership and dignity. The real revelation however is Steinfeld who handles the scripts grandiloquent dialogue with ease and steals scores of scenes from her costars. She makes Mattie a force to contend with a steel-spined proto-feminist hero and a huge nuisance all at once. Her character is as rich and complex as the film surrounding her. Its one of the best performances of the year in one of the finest American films of this young century. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

ABOUT THE MOVIETrue Grit   1/2 stars out of four Stars Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Hailee Steinfeld Josh Brolin |DirectorsJoel and Ethan CoenDistributorParamount PicturesRating PG-13 for some intense sequences of violenceRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The original True Grit might have been eclipsed by John Waynes larger-than-life persona but the Coen brothers remake is an ensemble piece that feels freshly their own. Joel and Ethan Coen have pulled off an impressive feat repurposing a classic film with their idiosyncratic blend of dark deadpan humor and palpable suspense while remaining ultra-faithful to the novel. In fact their elegant version with its distinctively formal dialogue hews more closely to Charles Portis book than the 1969 film. Three stellar performances are at the epicenter of this western tale Jeff Bridges takes the Wayne role as the grizzled eye-patched U.S. Marshal Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn. Hailee Steinfeld plays spunky 14-year-old Mattie Ross who is on a quest to avenge her fathers murder. Matt Damon is the clownish Texas Ranger known only as Mr. LaBeouf ( pronounced LeBeef). The two men have a wonderfully quirky chemistry with Steinfeld a talented newcomer. Mattie and Cogburn are searching for the dastardly killer Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) and are joined by LaBeouf who hopes to nab Cheney for a host of other crimes. Its a star-making role for Steinfeld as the feisty Mattie bent on seeing her fathers killer brought to justice. Shes no ordinary girl matter-of-factly outsmarting men five times her age. The man she enlists to help her is no run-of-the-mill marshal. Cogburn is a hard-drinking cranky sort. He initially refuses the offer but resistance to Mattie is futile. Bravely she tags along on the hunt to ensure that the sloppy Cogburn delivers what she paid him for and also to face down the man who robbed her of a father. Bridges is superb the ideal contemporary actor to play Cogburn a one-eyed sot who shoots first and may or may not ask questions later. Wayne who won an Oscar for the role played him as a nasty codger with a heart of gold but Bridges Cogburn is tinged with unpredictable menace. Steinfeld communicates a blend of innocence and shrewdness ideally suited to the role. Shes the picture of restraint in her braids and serviceable hat yet deep reserves of emotion surface sadness over her fathers death a lonely sense of purpose and yes gritty determination. Damons is a comic role and the handsome actor subtly disappears into the part of a loquacious buffoon. Cinematographer Roger Deakins creates a striking portrait of the Old West with muted colors and panoramic vistas. The storys deliberate rhythms are augmented by a gorgeously moody score by Carter Burwell whose longtime collaboration with the filmmakers pays off brilliantly here. But the slow pace and evocative music never interfere with Grits morbid sense of humor and offbeat fun. Not a false note is struck. True Grit is more than a remake. Its a triumph in the long list of Coen successes. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

"True Grit review Elements of remake may be better than original but overall original classic is better |       NJ.com comments True Grit review Elements of remake may be better than original but overall original classic is better Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 22 2010 at 801 AM updated December 22 2010 at 1119 AM View/Post Comments Lorey SebastianJeff Bridges plays Rooster Cogburn and Hailee Steinfeld plays Mattie Ross in Paramount Pictures ""True Grit."" If anyone ever needed a quick lesson in the difference between being a great star and being a great actor a new ""True Grit"" arrives to give a masters class. The original 1969 film directed by the straightforward Henry Hathaway starred John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn an ornery old marshal trying to prove hes not yet over-the-hill. The remake directed by the bright and often iconoclastic Coen brothers recasts the part with Jeff Bridges. And Bridges is terrific. But the point is ""True Grit"" doesnt need a terrific actor. It needs a beloved star. The first version certainly had that in Wayne but its reputation has dimmed over the years. When they announced their version the Coens flatly said they hadnt liked the first film and were going back to the original Charles Portis novel. And indeed theyre restored one or two colorful incidents underlined the books Old Testament sense of justice bookended the script with bits of the young heroines ironic narration and brought back the original rather bittersweet epilogue. But these are mostly tweaks and anyone who thinks the original adaptation was a travesty hasnt seen it recently (unlike perhaps a few of the Coens supporting players who reproduce the line readings of the original actors almost exactly). Movie Review True Grit (PG-13) Paramount (110 min.) Directed by Ethan and Joel Coen. With Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Hailee Steinfeld. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence alcohol abuse and strong language. Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS In fact both versions are equally faithful to the ornate dialogue and sturdy story -- in which stubborn 14-year-old Mattie Ross hires the states meanest marshal to find her fathers murderer and follows him into Indian territory accompanied by a comically self-impressed Texas Ranger. All of that is as immensely entertaining now as it was the first time around although the Coens have brought a much better sense of period detail as well as photography by Roger Deakins that captures vast starry nightscapes. Theyve added some much better actors too. Hailee Steinfeld makes a terrific debut as Maddie -- a nicely sweet-and-sour change from the first films Kim Darby who was all pouty annoyance and Breck-shampooed shag. Matt Damon finds a serious side to the preening Ranger that Glen Campbell never could. Lorey SebastianHailee Steinfeld plays Mattie Ross and Barry Pepper plays Lucky Ned Pepper in Paramount Pictures ""True Grit."" And the ever-inventive Bridges doesnt merely recycle his paunchy loser from ""Crazy Heart."" His voice located somewhere down in his kidneys his center of gravity down around his knees hes a lumbering bear of a man and quite a character. But he is not John Wayne. No one but John Wayne ever was. Which is why the original picture worked so well. By 1969 movie fans had a huge emotional investment in the star -- something ""True Grit"" (and later ""The Cowboys"" and ""The Shootist"") realized and used. To see those movies was to see a great hero grown old. It was to watch your own youthful illusions under attack. Only Clint Eastwood -- perhaps -- could have played this part today and brought it the same rich layers of sentiment. And thats the irony. Bridges is a far better craftsman than Wayne. The Coen brothers are much better directors than Henry Hathaway. Hell their ""True Grit"" is even a better-made film than the old ""True Grit."" But the old one is still the better movie.

Audiences remember Wayne as Rooster Cogburn the fat one-eyed drunk of a U.S. marshal. But thats about all that sticks. By staying true to Portis -- the richness of his language runs through the film like a vein of comic gold -- the Coens have crafted a vastly entertaining Wild West show that is memorable in every particular. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Dont mind the PG-13 rating. Family fare hasnt stopped the Coens from being playfully subversive or letting darkness encroach on the characters. With due respect to Jeff Bridges who is killer good at playing the hell out of double-tough Rooster and his rusted nobility the Coens wisely put their focus where Portis put it on Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) the 14-year-old dynamo from Arkansas who hires Rooster to bring in Tom Chaney (a sly wicked Josh Brolin) the varmint who gunned down her daddy. I dont know where the Coens found Steinfeld 13 but her star-is-born performance is worth shouting about. Steinfeld excels at Matties Southern idioms backed with Presbyterian steel. Shes Huck Finn as a teen diva. Just watch her outmaneuver a horse trader or slap around Matt Damons La Boeuf (pronounced ""la beef"") the vain Texas ranger who deems her too unattractive and too young to rouse his interest. Youll go nuts over Damon. He puts everything into the role and rides it to glory. La Boeuf hates it that Mattie insists on riding with him and Rooster into Oklahoma Indian territory where Chaney is in cahoots with Lucky Ned Pepper (a terrific Barry Pepper). Cinematographer Roger Deakins outdoes himself with images of rugged beauty. Roosters two-gun reins-in-his-teeth showdown (""Fill your hand you son of a bitch"") lets the Dude do the Duke proud. What makes True Grit a new classic for the Coens is the way the brothers absorb the unfairly unsung Portis into their DNA like they did with Cormac McCarthy in No Country for Old Men. True Grit is packed with action and laughs plus a touching coda with an older Mattie but its the dialogue that really sings. Great filmmaking. Great acting. Great movie. Saddle up.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 21 2010 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Paramount Pictures Hailee Steinfeld left and Barry Pepper are shown in a scene from True Grit. Lorey Sebastian/Paramount Pictures/AP           View Caption About video ads View Caption of The Coen Brothers are notorious for the nasty nihilism of their worldview - if thats not too grand a term - and so its somewhat surprising that ""True Grit"" their latest film is relatively straightforward. Its a good solid western and coming from anybody else that might be enough. Coming from the Coens it leaves a slight pall of disappointment in the air.Whats missing is the distinctiveness that makes the Coens movies both the great ones (""No Country for Old Men"") and the not-so-great (""The Hudsucker Proxy"") identifiably theirs alone. Theyve tamped down their scabrous black humor and theyve also toned down the comic possibilities in the marvelous 1968 Charles Portis novel upon which the film is based.The original movie adaptation of ""True Grit"" which came out in 1969 starred John Wayne in his Oscar-winning role as the besotted one-eyed Deputy Marshal Rooster Cogburn. In the Coens version Jeff Bridges who is thrice the actor Wayne was plays Rooster. Unlike Wayne hes actually giving a performance and not a scenery-chewing star turn although given the films overall subdued tone more munching might have been fun. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Related Ten best movies of 2010 Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Still it seems a bit churlish of me to complain that the Coens arent doing many of the same things distinctive as they are that Ive often criticized them for in the past. Their craft and intelligence remain solid; only their imprimatur has changed.Rooster is hired by the imperiously precocious 14-year-old Mattie Ross (the wonderful newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) to track down her fathers killer in Indian country in the 1870s. Accompanying them is a Texas ranger named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who is as straight-arrow as Rooster is screw-loose.Like so many directors before them the Coens are drawn to the classical western tradition of moviemaking. With the immense help of their cinematographer Roger Deakins they render the landscape in ways that set apart its inhabitants as actors in a vast folkloric enterprise. The people who also include Josh Brolin as the killer and Barry Pepper as the scurvy gangleader Lucky Ned all seem to have stepped out of a tall tale although the Coens dampening effect keeps them all within bounds.Bridges previously worked with the Coens on ""The Big Lebowski"" which has achieved iconic status as the slacker movie par excellence. In ""True Grit"" Bridges is a lot closer to his dissolute country singer Bad Blake in ""Crazy Heart"" than to Lebowski. Hes a mercenary and a boozer and it wouldnt even be out of character for his signature black eyepatch to be a sham.But Bridges lets us know that deep down Rooster wants the same thing Hallie does - justice. And in his own slobbola way hes just as tenacious as she is. Thats what she notices about him the first time she meets up with him (while he is fittingly in the outhouse). Without trying to jerk tears from us the Coens make it clear that these two are soul mates.Matt Damon is a tad bland but at least unlike Glen Campbell in the 1969 version he isnt required to sing for us. Steinfeld however is in many ways a perfect fit for the Coens. Her dead-on no-nonsense line deliveries with their contractionless biblical cadences are resolutely unsentimental. Mattie is a highly driven character but - and this is the key to Steinfelds gifts as an actress - shes never boring. Her intensity has modulations.Great westerns almost by definition have a largeness of spirit a fullness in which the quotidian morphs inexorably into the mythic. ""True Grit"" falls short of all that perhaps because largeness of spirit requires more emotional generosity than the Coens are likely capable of. But on its own conventional terms the film succeeds - maybe not as a ""Coen Brothers"" movie but as a tall tale well told.

Each in its way the Coen brothers True Grit and Sylvain Chomets The Illusionist breathes life into a celluloid fossil--The Illusionist in lovingly animating an unproduced script by the great Jacques Tati True Grit by boldly reanimating the comic Western that secured John Wayne his Oscar 41 years ago.Opening with a strategically abbreviated Old Testament proverb (""The wicked flee when none pursueth"") True Grit is well-wrought if overly talkative and seriously ambitious returning the Coens to the all-American sagebrush and gun smoke landscape that has best nourished their wise-guy sensibility (Blood Simple The Big Lebowski No Country for Old Men). This perverse buddy tale in which an implacable 14-year-old girl (Hailee Steinfeld) bonds in vengeance with the one-eyed one-note bounty-hunting windbag marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges in the Wayne role) is one of the brothers least facetious movies--despite a prolonged meet-cute as little Mattie stubbornly attempts to roust Rooster from a rustic privy to secure his aid in tracking her fathers murderer into Indian territory.The Coens are still themselves. As one colleague remarked--unprompted--upon leaving the screening where True Grit was previewed for New York critics ""They always do something to make you hate them."" (In my case the moment happened early on with a gag based on the hanging of a--dare one say--Native American.) But True Grits most serious lapse is more aesthetic than ethical--and less Hollywood than film-school. The brothers repeatedly invoke a superior movie--not the 1969 True Grit which is Waynes built-in mythic valence aside in every way inferior to the Coen version but the 1955 classic Night of the Hunter whose recurring hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" is repeated throughout the new True Grit.For the most part the Coens is a highly enjoyable yarn stocked with pungent bushwa and a full panoply of frontier bozos. However hammily he rasps and fumfers the Dudes Rooster is more nuanced and less overbearing than the Dukes as well as more original. (Wayne lifted many of his gravel-voiced mannerisms from Hollywoods Depression-era pug-ugly Wallace Beery.) Never less than disciplined Matt Damon is a strong foil to Bridges rumbling stumbling grumbling grizzled scapegrace as the upstanding mildly pompous Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (a part originally played--for the kids--by singer Glen Campbell) who joins the magical mystery tour.Once constituted the posse makes for a mouthy self-aggrandizing trio although its relentless little Mattie who serves as the movies key gimmick; even feistier than the much-lauded heroine of Winters Bone shes self-possessed schoolmarmish full of sass and downright uncanny. ""I am puzzled--what is she doing here?"" LaBoeuf more than once wonders in the oddly formal faux-Mark Twain diction that characterizes the dialogue.The Coens manage to render Choctaw country uncanny as well--the spectacle of a corpse dangling from a tree and a bear seemingly bestride a horse are portents worthy of Jim Jarmuschs Dead Man. The brothers have always been good on scary outlaws (in this case Josh Brolin) and with its sod houses and bleak weather their West is as inhospitable as it should be.Despite or perhaps because of Waynes clownish performance True Grit I was the comfortingly ""normal"" middle-American Western of its season opening at Radio City in time for July Fourth a week after The Wild Bunch splattered screens with war-movie carnage and a few months before Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid insouciantly trashed the genres remaining moral pretensions. The Coens True Grit is considerably more faithful to Charles Portiss novel than was the 1969 movie and consequently far darker.For years now just about every credible Western--Unforgiven Dead Man Wild Bill (Walter Hills near-forgotten vehicle for a far more ferocious Bridges) The Assassination of Jesse James--has been an oddity if not a walking corpse. True Grit belongs with these ghost stories and in suggesting that were all haunted by things we cant understand it carries its own Coen-trademarked mystery. Whereas the full Biblical proverb that introduces True Grit ends with praise for the bravery of the righteous the Coens cut directly to the chase suggesting only the power of a guilty conscience.Like True Grit The Illusionist is at least in part a chaste father-daughter romance--additionally so in that animator Sylvain Chomet perpetrator of the splendid retro-toon The Triplets of Belleville was given the source material by Tatis own daughter.Chomet sets The Illusionist on the cusp of the 60s around the time Tati wrote the script as a follow-up to his hit Mon Oncle; the animator presents his title character a middle-aged itinerant stage magician not as Tatis alter ego Hulot but as Tati himself. Ungainly yet dignified--given a vaguely aristocratic mien as well as Tatis actual name Tatischeff--the illusionist is introduced with a series of mildly disastrous performances in Paris (where he is compelled to play straight man to his obstreperous rabbit) and London (sharing the bill with an obnoxious quartet of proto-Beatles mop-tops). The London fiasco is a prelude to a tour of the highlands. The magician gives his most appreciated performance in some back-of-beyond Scottish pub. When he leaves for Edinburgh the bars naive young slavey an unprepossessing slip of a girl named Alice tags along convinced that his conjuring tricks really are magic.At once recognizable and improbable sketchy and detailed Edinburgh is the illusionist aside Chomets main character. (The movie ends with the shop lights on Princes Street going out.) Tatischeff and Alice move into a hotel full of depressed circus types and separately explore a city populated by cheerful drunks. Alice longs for new grown-up clothes and as if by magic the illusionist provides them. (Unknown to her and a source of comedy for us hes been working nights in a garage and doing department-store sale demos for extra money.)Although more wistful than the hyper-energetic Triplets The Illusionist is equally comic. (As in Tati or Triplets there is far more noise than dialogue.) No less impressive than Chomets character animation is his sense of timing. For its 80 minutes the movie creates the illusion that not just Tati but his form of cerebral slapstick lives. Late in the movie M. Tatischeff leaves Alice a note explaining ""Magicians do not exist."" The Illusionist means to demonstrate that they do. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

More about True Grit >> Although True Grit Joel and Ethan Coens artfully wrought and agreeably wry western is based on Charles Portis 1968 novel the films quotations from the Old Testament literal and metaphorical are everywhere. Some of these references too hail from Portis book but after tackling the trials of Job in A Serious Man it appears that the moviemaking siblings have taken an especially keen interest in the venerable Christian and Hebrew texts. True Grit begins in fact with an epigram out of Proverbs 281 ""The wicked flee when none pursueth. . . . "" The rest of that line the Coens leave offscreen but its worth noting because it speaks to the nature of True Grits impossibly plucky heroine "" . . . but the righteous are as bold as a lion."" Mattie Ross all of 14 and played with sublime certitude by newcomer Hailee Steinfeld is that bold lioness. As True Grit begins the pigtailed girl has arrived in Fort Smith Ark. to collect the body of her dead father and to hire a bounty hunter to go after the killer. She fully intends to join in the chase and the early scenes of Mattie haggling with a stable owner questioning the bill for her fathers coffin and dogging the one-eyed gunslinger who shes got in mind for the job reveal just how composed and confident this pip-squeak is. Her acuity her gumption her way with words . . . if 2010 has been a great year for womens roles and it has then its essential to put Mattie Ross up there near the top of the list. (And shes a good three years younger than Ree Dolly the brave backwoods teenager of Winters Bone.) As folks who remember John Wayne in the original True Grit well know the name of the U.S marshal that Mattie offers to employ is Rooster Cogburn. Jeff Bridges - whose previous collaboration with the Coens produced cinemas iconic stoner Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski - plays Cogburn with eyepatch and baggy long johns and with a gruff grizzled conviction. Cogburn it can be argued is a whole lot like Bad Blake - the booze-soaked country balladeer of Crazy Heart that won Bridges his long-overdue best-actor Oscar this year. Neither Blake nor Cogburn is at the top of his game both keep a bottle (or two) close by out of necessity and redemption comes in the form of a younger woman (Maggie Gyllenhaal in Crazy Heart) who expects better of the man than hes currently able to show. (As for the Duke and his 1969 True Grit The Coens have said that they did not revisit the earlier film - which won Wayne an Oscar - and that they wrote and conceived their version based wholly on Portis prose. In a similar spirit this reviewer will not cite the previous iteration again.) And so off Mattie and Rooster go - though thats not exactly how things start. Not to spoil one of the finer of many fine scenes the Coens have orchestrated the girl and the marshals ride-up doesnt officially begin until shes done some demanding equestrian work of her own on a pony called Blackie. And Mattie and Rooster arent alone then either Theres another lawman out to catch Tom Chaney a rather comically florid Texas Ranger by the name of LaBoeuf (pronounced here as le beef). Matt Damon sporting spurs and Stetson imbues deadpan dignity to a part thats got considerable foolishness about it. His campside recollections of Ranger lore are particularly rich. Josh Brolin shows up as Chaney the coon in Mattie and Roosters ""coon hunt"" and Brolin plays the murderer as a kind of dim but dangerous thug. But even he speaks with a kind of antique eloquence - the language in True Grit is one of the films greatest pleasures. Even the crustiest of cowpokes talks in artful winding sentences with a formality and manner that do as much to take us back to the 1870s as do the period clothes and props. True Grit is probably the least ironic picture in the Coen Brothers worthy canon but that doesnt mean its devoid of their signature oddities that it doesnt take a few dark strange turns. The unexpected sight of a bear riding horseback or the fidgety manner in which a defense attorney takes to the witness stand or the offhand but lamentably truthful way in which blacks and American Indians are treated by the whites of the post-Civil War West - there are Coen-esque moments here to be sure. For some reason True Grit got me thinking about The Lord of the Rings too another tale where an unlikely and seemingly ill-equipped protagonist rides off on an epic quest aided here and there by curious men on horseback and forced to face daunting challenges in the form of evildoers serpents and dark holes in the ground. Of course there are plenty of snakes and caves in the Bible too. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

The merry pranksters of the movie world just three years removed from their Oscar-winning adaptation of McCarthys No Country for Old Men  have kept the dirt under the fingernails of Charles Portis novel and left the previous movie version in the dust. That 1969 film a clunky sentimental victory lap for John Wayne was also a last gasp from an old Hollywood system quickly giving way to the industrys young Turks. The new version based on the novel and not the first movie is an improvement in every way. Its an old-time Western for the 21st century.Jeff Bridges wraps himself in the role of crotchety U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn and turns in a performance at least the equal of his Oscar-winning turn in last years Crazy Heart. Director of photography-lighting wizard Roger Deakins conjures a series of stunning Western tableaux including an opening shot that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. True Grit puts such virtuosity at the service of a lean story and makes that story feel archetypal even biblical The sense of Old Testament retribution at the heart of No Country is alive and well here.The Coens are crafty and they know theyre dealing with a tale that crosses over from their usual art-house audience to a more family-friendly crowd. When 14-year-old Mattie Ross (excellent newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) crosses a river on her noble steed the music soars and were practically invited to cheer. Mattie is the films engine; her quest to find the outlaw (Josh Brolin) who killed her father leads her to the heavy-drinking marshal and her pluck keeps Cogburn and a comically proud Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) off-balance throughout the movie. This is no country for young women but the kid holds her own whether shes shooting a rifle or threatening everyone with her Arkansas lawyer.Bridges digs deep to flesh out Cogburn. Beneath his growling guttural speech is a rambling storyteller with sharp-edged humanity a larger-than-life figure stripped bare and made real. Like everyone else in the movie he speaks in the mannered diction on display in much Western literature (very few contractions or wasted words) which accentuates the illusion that this True Grit sprang from some long-lost collective frontier imagination. ""Ive grown old"" Cogburn croaks in one climactic scene and for a moment youd like to see Bridges take a shot at doing Shakespeares King Lear.Shot in the Austin area and in New Mexico True Grit creates a bracing synthesis of classical Hollywood storytelling and grimy Western mythology. This is no revisionist Deadwood Western; the usual Coen eccentricities are sparsely sprinkled giving them the bite of good timing. This movie has something that the Coens are usually too pleased with themselves to create grandeur.Follow movie critic Chris Vognar on Twitter chrisvognar. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"A grittier Grit Talent upgrade better matches a classic novel - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs A grittier Grit Talent upgrade better matches a classic novelTrue Grit a 3 starsDecember 21 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe new ""True Grit"" restores all the grit removed in the first version (the 1969 Henry Hathaway film starring John Wayne) of the 1968 Charles Portis novel. All of Portis sardonic wit has been retained this time and then some. The ""then some"" derives from this projects writers directors and editors all of whom are Joel and Ethan Coen who edit under a pseudonym and who have been making Westerns (of variously disguised sorts) film noir riffs and revenge tragicomedies their entire adult filmmaking lives. Though this is a wintertime story set in the 1870s were quite close visually to the world of ""No Country for Old Men"" the movie that handed the Coens their second Oscar (the first was for the ""Fargo"" script). The tale is set in Arkansas and what was then known as the Indian Territory (later Oklahoma); the Coens and their crack cinematographer Roger Deakins shot ""True Grit"" in New Mexico and West Texas where they photographed ""No Country."" The biggest change from the 69 ""True Grit"" is the best thing about this formidably well-crafted picture. Portiss narrator and heroine 14-year-old Mattie Ross runs the show this time not the one-eyed marshal. Her flinty Old Testament eye-for-an-eye search for her fathers killer guides the story every inch of the way. A droll Jeff Bridges as the Confederate Civil War veteran and U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn keeps his voice far far back in his throat back where the whiskey and gravel resides. In a distinct uptick from the 69 version Matt Damon plays the self-appointed dandy of a Texas Ranger LeBoeuf in a more confident vein (though the Coens push this character all the way into Caricature Territory) than Glen Campbell was able to manage. More importantly though Hailee Steinfeld is a real find as Mattie. When Kim Darby played her in 69 the actress was already in her early 20s; Steinfeld is still a teenager in addition to being an appealing presence and a fine stoical observer to her characters fortunes. Though third-billed Josh Brolin has little screen time as the scoundrel theyre after; Barry Pepper (as Lucky Ned) is no less scary as one of the killers compadres. The results? Good. Not great. Throughout ""True Grit"" (and this isnt the first time anyones wondered this about a Coen brothers film) youre engaged in a guessing game regarding how seriously to take what happens or how seriously the Coens are taking it. They love Portiss language that much is clear and theyve hired clever full-bodied actors who can mine that fancy 19th century verbal embroidery for all its dark comic value. Near the end I think the movie transcends its limitations when we learn of Matties fate. The tableaus and graceful mournful transitions we see taking us from the narrators childhood to middle age from one century to the next are as fine a series of images as these filmmakers have created. There is a sad undertow which the novel had as well as plenty of surface wit also from the novel. Its a better film version in all respects than the previous ""True Grit."" And it feels more like an assignment fulfilled than a passion pursued. But craft this strong -- and despite the tonal uncertainty true -- should not be taken for granted. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of western violence including disturbing images) Cast Jeff Bridges (Rooster Cogburn); Matt Damon (LaBoeuf); Hailee Steinfeld (Mattie Ross); Josh Brolin (Tom Chaney); Barry Pepper (Lucky Ned) Credits Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen based on the novel by Charles Portis; produced by Scott Rudin Ethan Coen and Joel Coen.

The surprise - or vague disappointment - is the prevailing lack of Coen-ness in the movie - the cynical bemused irony the weird little flourishes and curlicues at the edges of scenes the resigned bleakness that usually courses beneath their best films (No Country For Old Men Barton Fink Millers Crossing Blood Simple The Man Who Wasnt There). You can see what drew the Coens to remake a movie that featured John Wayne in one of his most iconic roles Charles Portis novel is so chock-full of verbose dense wordplay True Grit sounds like the Coens wrote it themselves (roughly 70 percent of the dialogue comes straight from the book though). One of the early scenes in the film in which 14-year-old Mattie (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld in a stand-up-and-take-notice debut) haggles with a horse trader over the price of her murdered fathers steeds is a breathless and hilarious exchange tinged with just a touch of surreal humor a Coen specialty. Much of True Grit however is played straight. Mattie eager to avenge her fathers murder by the treacherous Tom Chaney (John Brolin) hires the alcoholic cranky marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges taking his paunchy drunkard schtick from Crazy Heart a few yards deeper). At first Rooster whos never seen a corked bottle he didnt want to pop open patronizes the girl and sends her on her way. But when she persists and proves she can pay the promised reward the marshal agrees to the job. Also on Chaneys trail is a Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) eager to collect the bounty on the fugitives head. After much discussion - and a daring river crossing on horseback by Mattie to prove she can handle herself - the three agree to pursue their man together. The Coens give Damon a great entrance and the actor proves a natural at tangling with his two unlikely partners (""You give out very little sugar with your pronouncements"" he tells the driven Mattie. ""You do not varnish your opinion"") The heart of True Grit is the relationship between the gruff Rooster and the spunky Mattie which gradually transforms from a business deal to a paternal bond. Once again working with their longtime cinematographer Roger Deakins the Coens embrace the hallmarks of the western genre - the wide open vistas untamed terrain and the human snakes lurking throughout. The movie doesnt opt for an epic sweep The story is light on gunplay and sticks close to the three lead characters with Bridges delivering a highly entertaining turn as the irascible drunkard who is much more astute and experienced than he appears (hes so ornery he kicks kids off porch steps when they are in his way then kicks them again on his way out just for the hell of it). The Coens have always loved genre so naturally they would eventually try their hand at a straight-up oater. The movies modesty is surprising and initially feels like a bit of a letdown. But once you settle in with the film thats in front of you instead of the one you were expecting True Grit draws you in as fully as the Coens best work and culminates with a surprisingly moving epilogue that proves the directors werent just conducting a technical exercise. What True Grit lacks in eccentricity or originality it makes up for with real heart - and ear-tickling wordplay. Cast Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Hailee Steinfeld Josh Brolin Barry Pepper.

True Grit Good Directors Joel and Ethan Coen. Cast Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Hailee Steinfeld. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of Western violence including disturbing images. So with their relatively straightforward version of ""True Grit"" you might rightly say that Joel and Ethan Coen have defied expectations again. That will not be the general consensus; instead there will be complaints that the film is not idiosyncratic enough not offbeat enough not weird enough to take its place in the Coen brothers canon. >> Guide to this weeks new movies So what? ""True Grit"" is a gorgeously shot well-acted Western that resonates more the more you let it settle. Jeff Bridges is inventively dissolute as the heir to the John Wayne role in the first movie version (for which Wayne won his only Oscar) Matt Damon reliably strong as an amusingly arrogant Texas Ranger and Hailee Steinfeld in her first feature outshines them both. Like Charles Portis novel (and unlike the Wayne film) the story is told from the point of view of a grown Mattie Ross played for most of the film by Steinfeld as a 14-year-old girl seeking revenge on Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin in a much smaller role than youve been led to believe) who killed her father. She hires Rooster Cogburn (Bridges) an aging U.S. marshal because she has heard he has true grit. He also has a bad attitude a drinking problem and a lot of extra weight around the middle but Mattie is convinced Roosters the man to help her and after initially rebuffing her he succumbs to her insistence - and her money - and takes the job. Then LaBoeuf (Damon) shows up and informs Mattie that he too is looking for Chaney and plans to pursue him as well. Roosters not happy about LaBoeuf LaBoeufs not happy about Rooster and neither of them is happy about Mattie tagging along. But soon the three of them are out in the wild hunting for Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) and his gang with whom Chaney is said to be running. Theyll find him of course but its the search thats so engrossing. The Coens use Portis formal language creating the incongruity between words and actions that helped make HBOs ""Deadwood"" so entertaining though it takes some getting used to. Bridges scene in a courtroom where he is interrogated about his quick trigger finger is a marvel. And Steinfeld is amazingly good at tackling the tricky rapid-fire word puzzles required of her character. Shes amazing good at everything actually giving Mattie a steely resolve that puts her on even terms - at least - with the grizzled Rooster and the self-confident LaBoeuf. Anything less and the film wouldnt work. Meanwhile Roger Deakins cinematography is stunning giving the Old West a clarity - warts and all - that puts you into the woods out on the plains right there with Rooster and Mattie and LaBoeuf. As for how ""True Grit"" stacks up against other Coen brothers films well to the extent that it matters it will undoubtedly rank somewhere between such great films as ""Fargo"" ""A Serious Man"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""lesser"" films like ""Burn After Reading"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty."" But thats beside the point. What matters in the moment is that ""True Grit"" not only measures up - and surpasses - the original but more important it stands on its own as an entertaining expertly made movie. A great one? No but a really good one. We would expect nothing less. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Photo Wilson Webb Matt Damon gives a great performance. (Wilson Webb) When it was announced that Joel and Ethan Coen were set to remake John Waynes greatest movie ""True Grit"" it heralded a culture clash of the titans as if U2 were to hold a jam-off with Beethoven or Annie Leibovitz were a finalist against Renoir in ""Portraiture With the Stars."" It isnt much of a contest The clear winner is John Wayne because the Coens are playing his game. The Duke couldnt do the Coens sly in-jokes but theyve never been able to reach out and move the audience to heights of emotion. Before now theyve never tried. In 1880s Arkansas 14-year-old Mattie Ross hires Marshal Rooster Cogburn to lead her on a a horseback journey into lawless lands in search of the desperado who killed her father. Together with LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) the clueless Texas Ranger who wants the murderer Tom Chaney for an unrelated crime they encounter death and commotion extracting clues from outlaws and corpses as their mutual respect grows. Damon does some of the best acting of his career here Everything about LaBoeuf feels soft from his suede coat to his fluffy mustache and the jingle-bell sound of his shiny spurs. Yet this sagebrush oaf -- Mattie calls him a ""rodeo clown"" -- becomes fully human as Damon locates the professionalism and wounded pride of a man who might be able to control his self-serving prattle if only everyone would stop making fun of him. The not-even-fat Jeff Bridges take on the ""one-eyed fat man"" Cogburn though isnt so much a grizzled outlaw-hunter as a high-functioning hobo with a violent streak. If he isnt quite as odd as Marlon Brando playing Fletcher Christian as a shrill fop in the remake of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" he comes close. He and Josh Brolin (who plays the desperado Tom Chaney as an addled doofus) arent acting in the same movie as the serenely earnest newcomer Hailee Steinfeld who plays the Biblically vengeful Mattie with stark unsentimental determination. Bridges and Brolin are working for laughs whereas Wayne was just funny. If they were a little less actorly it would be easier to revel in the immense pleasures of that euphonious speech from Charles Portis novel ""The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn a pitiless man double tough fear dont enter into his thinking."" The Coens love of language runs at least as deep as their visual sense and at times the verbosity produces a rhythm to equal the Coens screwball comedy ""The Hudsucker Proxy."" Though the remake is shorter than the original several scenes of low comedy and slapstick could have been cut. Rooster has words with a dentally obsessed oddball covered entirely in a bearskin and in an unfunny scene with LaBoeuf wastes several minutes of our time using pieces of cornbread for target practice. The Coens dont do enough to maintain a Biblical thread -- the movie begins with an epigraph from Proverbs -- in a world of such cruelty and mystery that the only possible sense to be made of it must be left to divinity. Yet the purity of Steinfelds ability to convey Matties guileless sense of justice gives the film plenty of emotional ballast particularly in the last 20 minutes or so. The final act blooms with sublime photography and music (by Roger Deakins and Carter Burwell respectively) as the story settles on Rooster and Matties will to stay alive. Not coincidentally we dont hear much from Bridges down the stretch. His nightclub-comics idea of a raspy drunkards voice would break the spell if we had to listen to him as he and Mattie struggle across a cracked and bitter moonscape. This is the Coens at their finest -- as is an earlier scene in which a dying man looks forward to ""walking the streets of glory"" -- but they and Bridges find it difficult to do anything without a raised eyebrow a dash of quirk the postmodern nudge-nudge. The Dukes G-rated ""True Grit"" -- which won its star an Oscar even as the X-rated ""Midnight Cowboy"" was crowned Best Picture -- was the last shotgun blast of the old Hollywood as it expired with a defiant roar at the hippies the druggies and the ironists. Its director Henry Hathaway was born in 1898. Courage and adventure were enough for him -- straight up no chaser. Joel and Ethan Coen cant resist tossing in a superfluous twist of lemon.

Photo Credit Wilson Webb Jeff Bridges plays Rooster Cogburn in Paramount Pictures ""True Grit."" Photo credit Wilson Webb - In conventional Westerns the heroes are men of honor who let their guns do the talking. In ""True Grit"" the heroes are a trigger-happy drunk and a 14-year-old girl who could talk the birds from the trees.Casual moviegoers may regard the new remake of the 1969 film that won an Oscar for John Wayne as sacrilege. But true aficionados of both Western movies and Western literature should rejoice. Instead of deferring to the Duke co-directors Joel and Ethan Coen have staked a claim to the source novel by Charles Portis unearthing a gold mine of rich dialogue rollicking adventure and resonant ideas about the American dream.Its circa 1880 and northwest Arkansas is at the end of the rail line. Mattie Hayes (Hailee Steinfeld astonishingly assured in her film debut) travels to a half-civilized outpost to retrieve the body of her cotton-merchant father and to track the scoundrel who shot him Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). She hires the meanest marshal in the territory one-eyed Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges as gruff as a grizzly) and after he sobers up they ride off in search of the gang that Chaney may have joined. Dogging them much of the way is LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) a proud Texas Ranger who wants to hang Chaney in Waco for an unrelated shooting. The testy trio have a comic chemistry as they argue about legal jurisdiction the Civil War and their relative survival skills but theres an element of romantic yearning in LaBoeuf that neutralizes Roosters cynicism and gives the story a lingering sweetness.Its rare for the Coens to make a movie with a PG-13 rating and with its rousing score by Carter Burwell and scenic cinematography by Roger Deakins ""True Grit"" is just a couple bloody gunfights removed from an old-fashioned Disney yarn. Yet its still unmistakably a Coen brothers movie from the stray weirdness of a bearskin-clad dentist to the bulls-eye delights of the dialogue. At the edge of the frontier every utterance is a rough nugget and every conversation is a card game - with steadfast Mattie as the sharpest dealer of all. But beyond the borders the Wild West is the domain of the cruel and the stupid and when the talkings done a man of action and a gallant horse ride to the rescue in a hauntingly effective finale.In overtaking a legend this ""True Grit"" earns its spurs.

(Wilson Webb - AP) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday December 22 2010; 1247 AM The writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen follow a familiar pattern with ""True Grit"" which after last years ""A Serious Man"" hews to the teams formula of following an absurdist comedy with a stately straight-faced drama. Here they remake the 1969 western that earned John Wayne his only Oscar a pedigree that might give lesser egos pause. But anyone who saw Henry Hathaways Technicolor extravaganza and remembers being puzzled by the topographical phenomena of snowy peaks in Arkansas and Glen Campbells hair know that even the most beloved classics can sometimes use a little sprucing up. This StoryMovie review Coen brothers True Grit is polished and entertainingTrue Grit trailer and showtimesAnn Hornadays Best Films of 2010Qamp;A with Hailee Steinfeld the True Grit star who made the Coen brothers giggleView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story In this case ""True Grit"" has received the care consideration and classy retooling that Charles Portiss novel probably always deserved. As Rooster Cogburn Jeff Bridges merrily assumes the familiar eye patch and whiskey jug to grunt growl honk and bray his way through one of the great scenery-chewing roles of cinematic lore. But even at its most heroically Falstaffian his performance is continually upstaged by those of his supporting players. In Campbells role of a tenderfooted Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf Matt Damon brings preening fun to a popinjay in spurs and suede fringe; his throwaway lines and sidelong glances finally realize the comic promise the character always possessed. For her part Hailee Steinfeld makes an uncommonly assured debut as the invincible Mattie Ross whose father when ""True Grit"" opens has been shot by a man named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Mattie arrives in Fort Smith Ark. to claim her fathers body acquire cash by way of some canny horse trading and avenge her fathers death by hunting Chaney down and seeing him hang. She enlists U.S. Marshal Cogburn to go into Indian territory and bring Chaney in; LaBoeuf who seeks Chaney for a murder in Texas comes along for his own purposes. Filmed in the sere sepia tones befitting the 19th-century West ""True Grit"" has the look feel and sound of that era its characters speaking in the courtly declamatory style that can first strike the ear as mannered but soon takes on the cadence of folk poetry. Nowhere does that language reach more musical heights than in an early set piece when Mattie negotiates to sell back some ponies her father purchased from Col. Stonehill (Dakin Matthews). The pairs ensuing whos-on-first roundelay playfully establishes the governing ethos of ""True Grit"" in which Old Testament values of retribution and redemption comfortably coexist with ribbing good fun. More than anything the scene announces that although Rooster is the character to whom the title refers its his young employer goad and conscience who will emerge as the movies most primal and memorable force. ""I admire your sand"" Stonehill says wearily finally giving in to Matties superior haggling skills. And so will the viewer as this precocious courageous young woman single-mindedly pursues her course of justice (this is a movie in which lawyers are invoked more often than in a John Grisham thriller). In many ways Mattie is the spiritual great-great-grandmother of Marge Gunderson who played the same kind of ethical center in the Coens 1996 masterpiece ""Fargo."" Like that film ""True Grit"" evinces none of the snarky ironic distance that can sometimes mark and mar a Coen brothers production. Here the films considerable humor comes not from the filmmakers own superior remove but from the characters themselves. That shift in perspective it turns out makes all the difference. It will surprise none of the Coens fans that ""True Grit"" is a technically accomplished movie; by now their mastery of every cinematic element is well established from writing and casting to cinematography editing and sound design. But unlike say ""No Country for Old Men"" in which technical brilliance was put to the service of a nihilistic enterprise ""True Grit"" concerns itself with something enduring and real as a young woman grapples with the cost of so adamantly claiming the high ground. ""True Grit"" has sweep and scope and entertainment value to burn but its Mattie who invests even the grandest aesthetic elements with meaning. Given the choice between following a serial killer with a stun gun and a 14-year-old girl fired by fierce moral certitude Ill take the one with the sand. True Grit rrr (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of western violence including disturbing images. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity Most Popular Twitter Activity Follow The Post Facebook Twitter View More Activity  Movie review Coen brothers True Grit is polished and entertaining Qamp;A with Hailee Steinfeld the True Grit star who made the Coen brothers giggle True Grit trailer and showtimes Ann Hornadays Best Films of 2010",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/21/AR2010122102573.html,200,truegrit31,truegrit,washingtonpost

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Some people come of age. Others have adulthood thrust upon them. Within hours of arriving at Ft. Smith Arkansas to retrieve her murdered father 14-year-old Mattie Ross (played crisply and unsmilingly by newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) has paid the undertaker and seen three men hanged. Her troubles have barely begun. True she could simply turn around and go back home. But shes determined to see her fathers killer (Josh Brolin) brought to justice which means enlisting the help of the meanest Federal Marshal money can buy a one-eyed frontier veteran named Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) whos happy to pull a cork or a trigger happier still to say as few words as possible while doing so and prone to few gentle sentiments when he does talk. Hes the perfect guide in other words for the hard country into which her nemesis has disappeared. In this second adaptation of Charles Portis 1968 novel--the first earned John Wayne his only Oscar--Joel and Ethan Coen offer sweeping mythic images of the Old West then populate them with characters who behave heroically either by accident or in spite of tremendous flaws. Having become a lawman only after stints as a bushwhacker outlaw and restaurateur Cogburn never appears settled into his career on the right side of the law and Bridges plays him as a man in the midst of a perpetual grump when circumstances dont force him to rise to the occasion. He stands in sharp contrast to Matt Damon as LaBoeuf a vain Texas Ranger also on the killers tail. The Coens direct True Grit with a light touch but like Portis stark funny novel their adventure tale shaves off none of the rough edges. Its simultaneously rollicking and grave alternating moments of fine dark humor with startling violence as it drags Mattie into the world of adult responsibilities and the danger and lost innocence that come with them. She tries to buy revenge using the terms of trade her father taught her then discovers shes made a purchase that wont fit easily fit onto a sum-filled balance sheet. The West here is a place of blood black humor and unsparing consequences a land to test the character of even the toughest men to say nothing of a willful girl with revenge in her heart and braids still in her hair.

"Movie Review ""True Grit"" | Movie Nation Movie Nation Filmgoing movie loving and a good argument. On a good day. Skip to content - Movie Review ""Mesrine Killer Instinct"" Movie Review ""Happythankyoumoreplease"" - Movie Review ""True Grit"" Posted on January 16 2013      by rogerinorlando Jeff Bridges dons John Waynes sizable boots in ""True Grit"" a grittier Coen Brothers version of the tale that won the Duke his Oscar forty years ago. And if the fit isnt as snug and the performance not as warm and exultant as Waynes the movie still manages to be a most worthy Western remake. In that stilted period-perfect speech that characterized the Charles Portis novel and the first film the adult Mattie Ross of Yell County narrates a tale from her past back when her daddy was murdered in rural Arkansas. She was 14 back then and screen newcomer Hailee Steinfeld is a pistol in this part. The moment we meet young Mattie dressed in black shes haggling with the undertaker.  And asking her age mid-argument will just annoy her. ""That is a silly question."" She nags a poor horse trader (Dakin Matthews) threatening him with legal action from her family attorney the unseen J. Noble Daggett. She ruffles feathers even as she earns the occasional ""I admire your sand."" Heres a girl with grit. Mattie is a stubborn kid -- ""I intend to see Papas killer hanged."" Nothing will dissuade her. And as she asks who to hire for the dirty job of chasing the murderer one mans description meets her approval ""a pitiless man  fear doesnt enter into his thinking."" That would be Marshal Rooster Cogburn a man she hopes ""with true grit."" Bridges gives Rooster a lurching slack-jawed top-heavy quality. This is a one-eyed drunk who wont brook any questioning of his past or his trigger-happy methods.  This Rooster barely tolerates Mattie even after shes met his price for setting off into the Indian Territories in search of the killer Tom Chaney. Matt Damon is an interesting chatty choice to play  Laboeuf  an articulate pipe-smoker who is entirely too proud of his Texas Ranger status. He wangles his way onto their quest as does Mattie who stuffs newspaper into her daddys hat so that itll fit and will not be brushed off by these two bluff lawmen. ""I will see the thing done."" Their odyssey is every bit as epic as you remember it. Cogburn and Laboeuf re-fight the Civil War over their respective parts in it and Rooster never misses a chance to land a cheap shot such as ridiculing the Texans horse -- ""How long you boys been mounted on sheep? The sense of a time and place is as vivid here as it was in the original film. The violent encounters are more violent than those in John Waynes day (though not by much) and the story still has an ambling pace. And if the score is less heroic and the scenery less Alpine at least the cast and script are every bit as good as the much-loved original film. Josh Brolin brings a brutish humor to the thuggish Chaney and durable character actor Barry Pepper plays the outlaw leader Cheney has hooked up with Lucky Ned Pepper. Robert Duvall played Lucky Ned back in 1969. Theres pleasure in hearing Bridges deliver lines the Duke made famous -- ""I cant do nothing for you son. Your partners killed you and Ive done for him."" The funniest scene -- the horse trading (Strother Martin was in the original) is still hilarious. Its not a better film just a slightly different  slightly darker one lacking big laughs and those out-of-body moments that seeing John Wayne acting like a man who could smell that Oscar delivered in a truly larger-than-life performance. Bridges is more than Waynes match as an actor. But even in his iconic roles hes never more or less than absolutely authentic and real-life sized.  Something bigger was called for here both from him and the Coen Brothers behind the camera for this sturdy still  entertaining remake. Cast Jeff Bridges Hailee Steinfeld Matt Damon Josh Brolin Barry  Pepper Directors Joel and Ethan Coen Running time  1 hour 50 minutes Rating PG-13 for some intense sequences of western violence including disturbing images.

"True Grit | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; true-grit ) True Grit (United States 2010) December 19 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli True Grit one of the best films of 2010 is a reminder of why remakes are not always bad. The Coen Brothers interpretation of the 1968 Charles Portis novel is superior in almost every way (except one) to the 1969 Henry Hathaway edition. And while no actor could hope to eclipse the iconic performance of John Wayne as Marshall Rooster Cogburn (the role for which he won his only Oscar) Jeff Bridges makes the part his own if only for about two hours. With stronger overall acting a tighter script and better production design True Grit 2010 surpasses its predecessor as the definitive adaptation of the novel and stakes out a place in the hall of fame of American Westerns. True Grit is a tale of vengeance in the Old West (Oklahoma around the end of the 19th century to be specific) - that of 14-year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) for her murdered father. The culprit is a drifter named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin); in the wake of the crime he flees into ""Indian Territory"" and joins up with a gang fronted by Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper). Not dissuaded by the indifference of local law enforcement Mattie seeks out the one-eyed tough-as-nails drunkard Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to act as a bounty hunter. Although initially not interested Cogburn changes his mind when Mattie offers an attractive reward. Also accompanying Mattie and Cogburn is LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) a Texas Ranger hunting Chaney for the assassination of a Senator. As one might expect some bonding occurs between Mattie and Cogburn but its not the sentimental over-the-top variety one often finds in movies that throw two mismatched individuals together. Cogburn grows to admire Matties straightforward approach and ability not to flinch when things get rough. Mattie learns to see beneath the whiskey and recognize that Cogburn can be heroic when the circumstances warrant. LaBoeuf factors into the chemistry of the unusual posse but because hes a less interesting individual than either of his companions he often fades into the background. The Coen Brothers have stated with some justification that their version of True Grit is closer to the source material than Hathaways. However with the exception of the ending which was significantly reworked for the 1969 movie most of the differences are small. The tone is darker and more sardonic. An attempt is made to stick closer to Matties point-of-view (something difficult in the original due to the participation of a star of Waynes magnitude). The pacing is tightened. And the violence is more graphic - something to be expected in 2010 over 1969 although the Coens in a rare example of restraint limit the content enough to achieve a PG-13 rating. It wouldnt have taken much more to tip this to an R. True Grit is a Western but unlike many members of the genre the tone is lighthearted. Its not a comedy but like the book and the 1969 film instances of levity are sprinkled throughout. One trademark of the Coen Brothers is their ability to generate laugh-inducing moments from seemingly grim situations and thats in evidence here. Much of the humor is low-key and exists side-by-side with the drama and adventure of the story but its impossible to miss. One example is when Mattie haggles over the money shes owed by Col. Stonehill (played here by Dakin Matthews and previously by Strother Martin) - she runs circles around the older and craftier man who never expects to be bested in such a match by a 14-year old girl. The Coens have re-created the Old West in loving detail. It comes to life on screen in a way that was not the case in the 1969 True Grit. The town of Fort Smith Arkansas feels less like a clichA(c) and more like a genuine habitation. Its a bustling place evolving from the ramshackle locale popularized in many Westerns into a more modern civilized place. However as a triple hanging early in the movie indicates justice is still brutal and men like Cogburn are needed in a land that has not quite been tamed. The performances are across-the-board good with several actors - Matt Damon Josh Brolin and relative newcomer Hailee Steinfeld - easily outstripping the work of their predecessors. In fact as memorable as Kim Darby was as Mattie Steinfeld surpasses her delivering the mannered dialogue with ease and bringing a passion that Darby lacked. Damon surprisingly working for the first time with the Coens (he has collaborated with seemingly every other high profile filmmaker) settles comfortably into a supporting role representing LaBoeuf as a less confrontational figure than the one essayed by Glen Campbell. Brolin appearing in his second Coen Brothers film (following No Country for Old Men) lends Chaney more humanity and more menace than the character exuded when portrayed by Jeff Corey. Then theres Jeff Bridges whose previous outing for the Coens was as ""The Dude"" in The Big Lebowski. Here he has the unenviable job of filling John Waynes shoes. He does this in the smartest fashion possible - by paying subtle homage to the Duke (usually in little things like mannerisms) while not attempting to ape the portrayal. Its a testimony to Bridges capability as an actor as well as the decisions he made in crafting this interpretation that we accept him as Cogburn and dont spend the 110 minute running time missing Wayne. Essaying an iconic performance can be a thankless job fraught with pitfalls. Bridges finds the smoothest path between the bumps and ruts. It would be surprising if True Grit does not receive substantial Oscar attention; however the likelihood that Bridges will match Wayne in winning a Best Actor statuette for Cogburn is small especially when one considers that Waynes victory was in part a career acknowledgment. Still there are other areas in which at least the honor of a nomination is deserved. The Coens have fashioned one of the best Westerns in recent years - a modern reworking of a classic that never feels superfluous.

The 2010 version of ""True Grit"" is grimier slightly kookier trades Wayne for Jeff Bridges in a role that fits him just as well -- and perhaps most significantly also trades Henry Hathaways routine direction for the complex pastiche approach of Joel and Ethan Coen. Nevertheless the Coens have restrained themselves this time out resulting in a visually scrumptious product with little to offer beyond the acceptable ingredients of a classic western. The presence of Johnny Cashs ""Gods Gonna Cut You Down"" in the ""True Grit"" trailer suggests a fierce modern update to a genre woefully abandoned years ago. Instead the Coens have crafted a smoothly formulaic accomplishment that seems likely to go down as one of the more prominent footnotes to their greater projects. Thats not to say it doesnt work on its own terms; it does often to dazzling effect ""True Grit"" is a cinematic marvel that evokes the dreamy western iconography most commonly associated with John Ford. Photographed by Coens mainstay Roger Deakins the vast immersive vistas mesh nicely with a folksy soundtrack inspired by 19th century hymns courtesy of their other regular collaborator composer Carter Burwell. Together they recreate the welcome familiarity of a dust-caked universe. The brothers screenplay at times markedly similar to the earlier adaptation steadily tracks Mattie (impressively portrayed by newcomer Hailee Steinfeld) as she persists in joining Rooster on the trail for her revenge slowly sees beyond his rough exterior and begins to view him as a surrogate father figure. When the body count rises the Coens emphasize Matties growing disgust at the masculine violence around her turning her experience into a dark coming-of-age story. Its also a competent men-on-a-mission yarn with Matt Damon rounding out the main cast as a clumsy ranger named LeBoeuf always one step behind Roosters cautious detective work. Their progress has an erratic rhythm. After a lengthy trek through the wilderness the trio finally closes in on their murdering target the witless Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) and the climax of ""True Grit"" briefly crumbles in a clumsy shootout before winding back to a satisfying conclusion. Overall however ""True Grit"" has few memorable bits. Only specific comparisons between the two adaptations reveal the Coens sly voice beneath the surface. Known for matching physical overstatement with keen insights about human behavior their distinctive technique occasionally elevates ""True Grit"" to something beyond the boundaries of the genre. Fleeting comic violence (a pair of fingers suddenly lopped off; LeBeoeufs hysterically awkward tongue injury) and the almost Malick-like stillness of the closing shot provide glimmers of the directors stylistic flourishes. Mainly ""True Grit"" functions as an elaborate homage that results in their most conventional outing behind the camera. In recent years the Coens have been second only to Pixar with their track record of churning out widely enjoyable movies and their latest effort doesnt break that winning streak (at least not to the extent that say ""The Ladykillers"" did). Still its hard to shake the feeling that they settled for consistency over innovation. Thematically ""True Grit"" contains numerous links to their previous films from the barren landscapes of ""No Country for Old Men"" to the bumbling anti-hero of ""The Big Lebowski."" By blending into the material it suits them. But that doesnt make it any less obvious that they can do better. criticWIRE grade B+ This Article is related to Reviews and tagged In Theaters True Grit-2 More From IndieWireWe Combined All the Coen Brothers RankingsHow to Scare Yourself Shtless This Halloween A Viewers Guide (VIDEO)Exclusive Aja Naomi King Talks About Sci-Fi Thriller Reversion and the Power of Memories - Now in TheatersTwo Limited Release Films Also Opening This Weekend That You Might Be Interested in Seeing...

It sounds like you dont like them on a personal level and think they are rude and arrogant. That or you hate Charles Portis. Reply Claire Feinstein May 21 2016 949 pm Eric Way to go. It seems that some the Coen Brother fans cannot tolerate any realistic review of their films. I have enjoyed the Coen Brothers movies over the last decade. "" True Grit"" is a good film but nit a fantastic ground braking film. your review provides the appropriate balance. Reply BrandonJudell May 21 2016 949 pm Mr. Kohn has seldom been more on target than he is here in stating that ""True Grit"" boasts resplendent cinematography while being ho-hum on most every other level. So how does that rate a B+? Hopefully Mr. Kohn doesnt rate his prospective dates in a similar manner. ""Looks 10 Brains 0. Now thats a gal for me Shea B+."" Having interviewed the Coen Brothers several times and having been unable to get them to state anything even slightly insightful about their films I always thought the boys were pulling my leg with their dumb act. How could the makers of ""The Big Lebowski"" not be geniuses? After ""True Grit"" Im not so sure. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

First there are those who have read the rollicking 1968 novel by Charles Portis a beaut narrated in the unforgettable voice of Mattie Ross. Mattie tells the story of how as a 14-year-old girl on the 19th-century frontier she set out to avenge her daddys death at the hands of the coward and drifter Tom Chaney. She has considerable help from an outsize U.S. Marshal named Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn and Roosters would-be competitor a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf. Second there are those who are nostalgically fond of the defanged and more Cogburn-centric 1969 movie version for which a hammy post-cancer John Wayne won his only Oscar as the fat one-eyed drunken Rooster. Third there are those who have read the book and seen the 1969 movie and despaired at how the latter gummed up the startling and often funny tone of the former with a sweetened ending that was great for Wayne but hell for Portis. And fourth there are True Grit newbies eager to see a full Western by the brothers who made the unsweetened semi-Western No Country for Old Men. This same audience may be similarly excited about seeing Jeff Bridges -- the Coens ""Dude"" Lebowski himself -- as Rooster Cogburn Matt Damon as LaBoeuf No Countrys Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney and buzzed-about newcomer Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie. So before I assume the eyes of a newbie for the purposes of this analysis -- thats the dominant audience for whom this movie must after all make its case -- heres a word to others No this version still doesnt duplicate Portis crazy-cool literary swagger. The Coens lay their more deadpan filmmaking voice over the proceedings but at least as screenwriters theyre truer to the original story and to Matties place at the center of it all. Her grit is the headline. And yes its better than the original. The best of the new True Grit (in theaters Dec. 22) comes from the actors who bring their vivid characters to life. Its crucial for the man who plays the amoral gun-waving Cogburn to wallow without embarrassment in ornery seediness even in front of a fatherless girl. With an Oscar under his armpit for drunken dissolution in Crazy Heart Bridges is that man. Likewise the girl who plays Mattie had better have the sand to face down the Roosters of the world and grow into the steely older woman who narrates the story. With her resolute dark eyes and plainspoken poise Steinfeld holds the screen with believable adolescent fierceness. As for LaBoeuf well this isnt the first time recently that Ive delighted at how Damon has become one of Hollywoods most enjoyable versatile actors. Im happy every time I see him and hes a great costar here flavoring his LaBoeuf -- pronounced La Beef if you please -- with a piquant seasoning of Ranger vanity bounty-hunting avarice and Dudley Do-Right earnestness. What keeps us at arms length however is the almost reflexive Coen instinct to favor controlled surface style over emotional mess and to dote on weird slapshots of violence that dont leave room to feel real horror. And while No Country for Old Men and especially their stunning personal drama A Serious Man nudged these always erudite often insular filmmakers out of their comfort zone into fresh air this more climate-controlled Western retreats to safer ground despite the high body count. (The overload of home-on-the-range music from Carter Burwell doesnt help.) The slippery result Much is fine in True Grit including typically impeccable dusty-Western cinematography by Roger Deakins. Much is admirable or diverting especially when Bridges and Damons characters jostle for dominance and Mattie exerts her will. Too little though is wild like Portis can be wild despite the shoot-outs the horse gallops and Roosters inebriated sprees. Truer than the John Wayne showpiece and less gritty than the book this True Grit is just tasty enough to leave movie lovers hungry for a missing spice.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Punch Drunk Love The year-end awards bait arrives led by The Fighter True Grit and How Do You Know. By David Edelstein Published Dec 12 2010 ShareThis Bale and Wahlberg in The Fighter.  (Photo Jojo Whilden/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) Good news The Fighter is mistitled. Its not about another raging bull. Its about a whole raging family bulls cows even raging heifers. It opens in 1993 in the blue-collar section of Lowell Massachusetts where the punching doesnt stop at the ropes and the air is alive with epithets Ya junkbag ya skank ya cheap bastahd. At last the famously pugilistic filmmaker David O. Russell (George Clooney in a Playboy interview He turned on me and said You want to hit me? You want to hit me? Come on pussy hit me. Im looking at him like hes out of his mind. Then he started banging me on the head with his head) has found a set of characters more quarrelsome than he is two half-brothers Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale); Mickys bartending squeeze Charlene (Amy Adams); their boozy bottle-blonde mom Alice (Melissa Leo); and their fearsome armada of big-haired sisters. Ironically the title character Wahlbergs Micky is the movies peacemaker. He just wants everyone to get along so he can pummel people outside the family to a pulp. The Fighter takes a while to find its footing. It opens in a faux-documentary style with the emphasis on faux Once again Massachusetts accents prove to be the kryptonite of superstars. (Even Wahlberg cant nail the tricky Lowell dialect.) Bales Dicky once a boxer and the pride of Lowell is now the subject of an HBO whatever-happened-to doc he thinks is meant to herald his comeback. But its actually about how he became a crackheadwhich is bad for Dicky but good for Bale who gets a chance to do one of those overcommitted-Method-actor transformations which leaves him with bones popping out of his sallow flesh. Hes terrific but you know ick. Its the faded junior welterweight Micky now working in construction who decides to give the ring one more shot and who ends up getting the boost from HBO. In this he is assistedand prodded and sometimes browbeatenby his new girlfriend. It falls to Charlene to pry Micky loose from his druggie brother and loudmouthed mom and Amy Adamsin the past such an airy-fairy and ethereal little nunhas accomplished her own transformation. She has gained weight not much but enough to give her a cute tum and make her arms look like theyre used to heaving multiple pitchers of lager. And with her eyes like blue steel and swarm of red hair it doesnt take much to get her Irish up. The Fighter really takes off when her Charlene goes up against Mama Alice who calls her mystifyingly an MTV girl but is finally forced to respect her titanic will. You get the feeling that Leo a full-throttle scenery chewer was forced to respect Adams too Its mano-a-mano in that nutty Best Supporting Actress category. Director Russell reportedly signed on late in the game when Darren Aronofsky dropped out to punish ballerinas instead of boxers and his filmmaking is loose and spontaneous. The themes dont snap into focusId have liked a nod to the irony that HBO sells Dickys downfall as avidly as Mickys risebut the movie has so much texture that once it gets you youre good and got. The real Micky Ward was known for taking loads of punishment and the fighting is brutal. But Russell doesnt stylize the bouts or go for Raging Bullstyle slo-mo crucifixion poetry. Youre always aware of the people outside the ropes screaming at Micky who seems to feed on all that family drama to suck it in the way Popeye sucked in spinach. The Fighter suggests that a seedy nasty milieu can knock you down but also pick you up and shove you back in the ring to keep punching. Its a rousing picture. What moved Joel and Ethan Coen to adapt Charles Portiss 1968 novel True Grit for the screen anew 40-plus years after John Wayne made the one-eyed Marshall Rooster Cogburn his own? My guess is that they were turned on by Portiss voice his mixture of quasi-biblical dialect and morbidly funny modern fatalism. The novel is structured like an old-fashioned revenge saga except the villain is a hapless cretin and the hero a mean drunk who rode with the Confederate Captain Quantrill during the infamous Lawrence Kansas massacre of 1863. Director Henry Hathaway was too old-school to underline the sick jokes and Wayne had a mythical persona to uphold. The Coens signal their intentions by replacing the Duke with the Dude (Jeff Bridges) and introducing himor rather his voicefrom inside an outhouse. Behind the walls he sits churlishly refusing to engage with Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) a 14-year-old who seeks a man with true grit to help her capture her fathers killer. At that point all we can tell is that Cogburn has true shit. Next Why True Grit isnt as momentous an event as you might hope. 1 2 3 Next Share this story...

Its hard to imagine bigger boots to fill than the ones that earned John Wayne his Oscar in ""True Grit"" and yet Jeff Bridges handily reinvents the iconic role of Rooster Cogburn in the Coen brothers back-to-the-book remake. Though the sibs return things to the perspective of vengeance-bent 14-year-old Mattie Ross all eyes are definitely on Cogburn. Rather than a case of the Dude doing the Duke Bridges irascible old cuss is a genuine original who feels larger than the familiar saga that contains him. Awfully gritty for its PG-13 rating this characteristically well-crafted outing could draw a wide range of audiences ranking among the Coens more commercial pics. The story of a righteous young woman (played by unknown Hailee Steinfeld her plain-faced scowl framed by a pair of girlish braids) who enlists the help of the meanest toughest lawman she can find to track down her fathers killer (a pitiless Josh Brolin) ""True Grit"" fits the bill of properties that film purists would rather leave untouched. But in many ways Henry Hathaways film was already old-fashioned by the standards of late-60s Western storytelling (made all the more apparent when Sam Peckinpahs bloody ""The Wild Bunch"" opened one week later in June 1969) and is therefore ripe for retelling. What that original film offered was a revolutionary depiction of a frontier teen assertive enough to handle her own finances trade barbs with a pair of surly bounty hunters and avenge her fathers murder even if it meant staring down the varmint herself -- themes that reflected shifting gender roles at the time of its release. While the Coens significantly expand Matties role scrubbing away all sentimentality in the process the characters independent nature feels significantly less resonant 40 years on. No matter the Coens are strictly apolitical filmmakers whose interest in the material lies not in exploring gender-related themes; rather Charles Portis novel poses the opportunity to add another entry to their gallery of regional and period-specific portraiture a career-long obsession that spans a wide range of genres while remaining laser-focused on capturing the vernacular and mannerisms of the characters involved. Portis makes a logical target considering his ear for authentic dialogue and wry wit with ""True Grit"" offering a choice opportunity to attempt their first authentic Western (a far different beast in tone and energy from the 1980s-set ""No Country for Old Men""). The Coens show their appreciation for Portis prose by hewing close to the language of his novel evident from Matties tone-setting opening narration to the colorful barbs she trades with her two traveling companions -- the second being an indignant Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (rhymes with ""the chief"") sincerely yet self-deprecatingly played by Matt Damon. But the brothers also severely rein in the humor which the book offers in spades -- a curious call in light of the often-satirical undercurrent in their other films. What comedy does survive exists primarily between Bridges and Damon whose characters are constantly undermining one another in Matties presence. Since the broad strokes of the story are known by most the Coens are free to indulge in serious character investigation. And yet one major inescapable carryover from the 1969 film can be found in Cogburns age -- like Wayne Bridges is a good 20 years older than the 40-ish character Portis imagined. In keeping with the novel Steinfelds Mattie is a plain almost homely girl (characters frequently joke about her stern unladylike features) whose unrealistic sense of justice doesnt jibe with the untamed wilderness of the Choctaw Nation where her trek unfolds. Though the Coens tone down Matties Scripture-quoting sensibility her dispassionate view of violence matches the directors own which makes for several unflinching displays of Wild West punishment -- and a return to the books tough-luck epilogue. The films heavily styled language feels distancing at first not unlike the heightened dialogue in HBOs ""Deadwood"" with the actors drawling delivery making some of the lines virtually indecipherable. Even without catching every word the subtext of each exchange is clear as when Mattie dickers with a horse trader (Dakin Matthews) for her late fathers money demonstrating that she can hold her own in a mans world. In what surely ranks among the most peculiar introductions in screen history the Coens set Matties first encounter with Cogburn through the wooden door of an outhouse demystifying his character from the beginning only to build him back up during the rather taxing trial scene that follows. Bridges pulls off a total physical reinvention complete with whiskey-stained moustache rotting underbite and trademark eyepatch. The actor seems to have absorbed the character into his very marrow and though Cogburn seems perfectly set in his ways the great pleasure of the film is watching how his attitude toward Mattie goes from patronizing to paternal over the course of their adventure. As always the Coens support team help pull off the directors ambitions with Carter Burwell supplying a full-bodied reinterpretation of ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" (the same hymn featured in ""The Night of the Hunter"") and Roger Deakins widescreen lensing serving to de-romanticize the terrain and the characters themselves. For the most part ""True Grit"" resists the unspoiled vistas weve come to expect from Westerns favoring the craggy unkempt terrain of Cogburns face instead.

TWITTER Hailee Steinfelds exceedingly accomplished performance dominates surprisingly humorless Western. The one-eyed fat man is back but working in a very different key in the Coen Brothers take on True Grit a melancholy atmospheric Western with a 14-year-old girl at the center of it. A story of pursuit and sought-after justice that places in stark relief the main characters strengths and failings this wintery work is well played and superbly crafted but hits largely familiar notes giving it a one-dimensional feel without much dramatic or emotional resonance. The solid cast involving story and intrinsic appeal of the good guy-bad guy Western format should translate into decent mid-range business with the films ultimate box office fate heavily dependent upon how it plays for families and young audiences. Famous mostly for John Waynes enjoyably hammy Oscar-winning performance as Rooster Cogburn a growling boozing trigger-happy deputy marshal who grudgingly helps a young lady track down her fathers killer in Indian country in the 1870s the 1969 adaptation of Charles Portis wonderful novel exuded amiable relaxed charm under the direction of veteran Western director Henry Hathaway. Two obvious fixes the Coens tended to at once were restoring the proper age of the female lead (Kim Darby was 20 when the first film was shot) and casting a strong actor to play the Texas Ranger who uncomfortably accompanies Rooster and little Mattie Ross into a land filled with fugitive outlaws and no-accounts. These represent major plusses for the new film as screen newcomer Hailee Steinfeld makes an excellent Mattie and Matt Damon from the moment of his laconic boots-on-a-porch rail entrance designed to recall Henry Fonda in ""My Darling Clementine"" puts any thoughts of Glen Campbell immediately to rest. Startlingly however what the Coens have given up is humor. To readers of Portis novel which was a critical and commercial hit when published in 1968 the crackling colloquial often laugh-out-loud hilarious dialogue seemed almost ready-made for any screenwriter to more or less lift it intact. Marguerite Roberts put some perky folksy spin on it four decades ago. Joel and Ethan Coen while retaining some of Portis wordsmithing have oddly decided to drain most of the comedy from inherently funny lines and situations. Considerable character color is lost in the process particularly where Rooster is concerned; sure Wayne did a fair share of broad mugging in his day but that didnt mean Bridges and the others had to steer clear of the sort of comic timing that would only have enriched the material and made it more entertaining this time around. But the focus here is resolutely upon Mattie a remarkably poised self-confident and it must be said entirely humorless girl whose every move and decision is driven by her aim of tracking down Tom Chaney the man who shot her father. For the audience Mattie proves her mettle at the outset by completely having her way in negotiations with an experienced horse trader (fantastically well played by Dakin Matthews) thereby leaving no doubt that shell be more than able to hold her own with the imposing Rooster (whom she first confronts while hes occupied in an outhouse) the condescending LaBoeuf (Damon) and even Chaney (Josh Brolin) when she finally confronts him. Contrasting with the originals spectacular summer and early autumn Colorado mountain backdrops (the early town scenes were shot in Ridgeway near Telluride) this time the journey moves from a bleached dusty community into assorted wild stretches that eventually become inundated by the first snowy dustings of winter. At first shunned by her two companions who stand to collect rewards if they bring Chaney to justice Mattie simply wont go away. After a while its LaBoeuf who takes his leave after having proving oversensitive to Roosters bluster. It doesnt take long for Rooster to track down the baddies lairs first at a cabin where some nasty mayhem ensues then around a mountainside where the snaggletoothed Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) presides over scruffy gang that temporarily includes Chaney. Roosters one-man battle charge against four adversaries in a meadow is reproduced in almost identical fashion to the original film although the Coens end their telling on a wistful note by reincorporating the books coda set in 1903 a quarter-century after the main action. Although mostly divested of what in the book was her rigorously Christian outlook Mattie is otherwise everything shes meant to be in Steinfelds exceedingly accomplished performance. ""True grit"" may be what shes looking for in the man she selects to track down Chaney but Matties the one who has it in spades she means--and does--what she says and theres not a patronizing man in the Old West who doesnt learn the cost of misjudging her. Dark haired and clear-eyed Steinfeld convincingly conveys the characters refusal to be deterred without a trace of gamine-like coyness or girlish cuteness. Perhaps Frances McDormands performance in ""Fargo"" represented an implicit model. Bearded bellied and wearing his black eyepatch over his right eye (Wayne covered his left) Bridges eats and grumbles some of his dialogue and seems to be suppressing his sense of fun in a relatively realistic portrayal of man with a dicey past who has no problem giving flight to whatever demons might momentarily come to visit. His is an engaging but not dominant turn. Damons LaBoeuf on the other hand has far too thin a skin to be comfortable around the likes of Rooster and the actor skillfully reveals the insecurities of a man who needs to back up his badge with bravado. Brolins Chaney doesnt turn up until 80 minutes in and when he does the actor reminds forcibly of Robert Ryans memorable villain in Anthony Manns great ""The Naked Spur."" As always with the Coens the craft aspects are outstanding led by Roger Deakins superior cinematography Jess Gonchors detailed production design Mary Zophres textured costume designs and Carter Burwells often source-derived score.
