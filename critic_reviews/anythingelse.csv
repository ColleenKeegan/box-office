The anxiety-ridden New York milieu the Billie Holiday songs the shrink jokes are familiar but this time we see it all played out by a new generation. Jason Biggs takes the Woody role as a guilt-ridden pushover comedy writer besotted with a neurotic withholding Christina Ricci while Woody plays Biggss paranoid half-mad mentor who thinks the Upper East Side is crawling with Nazis. Relieved of his courting duties Allen gives his funniest performance in ages.The Rundown Directed by Peter Berg Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The Rock makes his bid to be the new Arnold in this comic bone-cruncher. (Arnold himself has a two-second cameo.) Hes sent to Brazil to bring back rich kid Seann William Scott and ends up fighting the private army of bad guy Christopher Walken while searching for ancient treasure. The twist is that the Rock refuses to use guns--until hes really really provoked. He and Scott work up some nice comic chemistry but its the dependably warped Walken who steals the most scenes. The frenetically edited fight sequences will satisfy the blood lust of the target audience.Bubba Ho-tep Directed by Don CoscarelliElvis Presley (Bruce Campbell) is alive and unwell in a nursing home in east Texas where he teams up with an old codger (Ossie Davis) who thinks hes JFK to battle soul-sucking Egyptian mummies. The always entertaining schlockmeister Coscarelli (""Phantasm"" ""The Beastmaster"") spins this nutty premise--from John R. Lansdales short story--into a one-of- a-kind horror movie hilarious a little scary and strangely poignant. Campbells cranky valiant sad-sack King is a soulfully funny creation.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

His aspiring comedy writer with woman trouble is exactly the sort of part Allen would once have played himself but the creator retains his stamp on it by insisting Biggs delivers the lines with typically Woody-ish intonation. Its no slight on the American Pie star to suggest this just isnt his thing but frankly thats the least of the misjudgements on view. You feel sorry for Christina Ricci doing everything asked of her as Biggs voluptuously maddening girlfriend yet her manipulative prick-teaser of a part comes across like Woodys hate-letter to womankind. And where does the young man go for advice on his travails? To Allen himself of course as a fellow writer who dispenses gnomic utterances (Its like anything else really?) and moral support when hes not revealing distinct psychotic tendencies. It seems were meant to think this guy is witty wise and a little edgy though the effect is truly resistible. Hes a pinched ageing misanthrope whose wisecracks about the Holocaust are screechingly inappropriate.Its a painful experience for any Allen admirer to sit through one of his movies without anything positive to say. Theres Darius Khondjis warm-toned camerawork and the soundtracks reassuring parade of jazz oldies but thats where the pleasure ends though its only fair to report a sprinkling of laughter at the screening I attended - someone somewhere was evidently getting a kick from this stuff. But really the timings gone the humours flat the insights mean-spirited. For a supposed light comedy its the years most depressing film.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Fresh Face Same Stale Story washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Fresh Face Same Stale Story Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 19 2003 DOUGLAS MACARTHUR once said old soldiers never die they just fade away. But Woody Allen one of the oldest soldiers around has gone one worse. In ""Anything Else"" he tries to extend the shelf life of his screen persona by hiring Jason Biggs as his alter ego. This Manhattan romantic comedy has the disconcerting effect of talking to someone via translator. Writer-director Allen whispers into Biggss ear and then the star of the ""American Pie"" franchise apes Allen with all the hemming hawing and one-liners weve watched and listened to since the 1972 ""Play It Again Sam."" This isnt even the first time Allens done this. He hired Kenneth Branagh as something of an alter ego in ""Celebrity"" to similarly dismal effect. Perhaps both films can help Allen realize hes the only one who can play himself. Biggs is Jerry Falk a twenty-something New Yorker with familiar Allen hallmarks. Hes a gag writer. He has regular sessions with a shrink who says nothing. Hes toying with writing a novel about a godless universe. And hes in a frustrating romantic relationship with a sexually repressed uptown girl in this case acting student Amanda (Christina Ricci). Well shes only repressed with Jerry. The thought of sex with other men now thats a turn-on. Other figures in the story include Danny DeVito as Jerrys two-bit but earnest agent and Stockard Channing as Amandas eccentric mother who moves in with the couple and tries on one occasion to get them to snort cocaine. The movie doesnt have the energy to be truly horrible. Its too muted and enervated. But its a somewhat tedious thing to sit through. Anyone watching this whos familiar with Allen films will register echo after echo of earlier better work including ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan."" It doesnt look to be satisfying activity for the actors either. Biggs seems wooden and uncomfortable. And of course why wouldnt he be? This is not him; this is so not him. Ricci has an interesting quirkiness about her but shes not especially compelling as a comic performer. Isnt there another ""Addams Family"" sequel she could play in? A relationship between these two for more than 90 minutes? Thanks anyway. Allen unable to stay away from the action plays Jerrys mentor a schoolteacher-cum-philosopher named David Dobel who inspires and poisons Jerrys mind with advice about life and relationships. Naturally he peppers all conversations with references to a wide variety of inspirations from Albert Camus to Henny Youngman. Hes so familiar its hard to concentrate on what hes saying as he leads us through another autodidactic ramble. You wonder if the story was strung together merely to deliver the vocabulary and these aphorisms punch lines and showoff parlor philosophies. Of course the story should be something of a conduit but it should stand on its own. And its title shouldnt prompt this burning question Can he do anything else? ANYTHING ELSE (R 108 minutes) -- Contains sexual situations sexual language and drug use. Area theaters.

By Moira Macdonald       Seattle Times movie critic Well at least the Billie Holiday songs are nice. If you took Woody Allens wonderful ""Annie Hall"" cast it with dull twentysomethings and added an older guy with black-rimmed glasses who wisecracks quotes Camus and at one point demolishes a car -- well youd have ""Anything Else."" But the real question is why would a great filmmaker want to do this? And why would anyone short of rabid Christina Ricci fans want to watch it? Allens latest is an oddly lifeless pastiche full of bits that you might recognize (the analyst the cocaine the paranoia the mismatched romance the pretty shots of Central Park) and adding up to precious little. Jason Biggs and Ricci play Alvy and Annie -- nope sorry Jerry and Amanda a would-be writer and a neurotic dilettante who meet fall in love and break up. Along the way flashbacks are employed Jerry addresses the camera to give us his take on things and many scenes take place on New York sidewalks. All of this worked just fine in ""Annie Hall"" a classic romantic comedy that holds up beautifully 26 years after its release. Here it just feels like desperation or perhaps boredom. Biggs and Ricci unfortunately are part of the problem; the two have no visible chemistry. Biggs best known for his boy-meets-pastry scene in ""American Pie"" is a dolefully handsome fellow but an awkward actor who seems a bit cowed by the material; the doll-eyed Ricci mostly whines and acts petulant. Movie review  ""Anything Else"" with Jason Biggs Christina Ricci Woody Allen Danny DeVito Stockard Channing. Written and directed by Woody Allen. 108 minutes. Rated R for a scene of drug use and some sexual references. Several theaters. Hes boring shes annoying -- clearly these characters dont belong together nor with anyone else. Half an hour into the movie the title seems like a taunt. Is there anything else Woody? Please? The screenplay feels like a first draft full of characters who keep getting dropped and picked up again (Stockard Channing in particular is wasted as Amandas lush of a mother) and except for one splendid bit about the Cleveland baseball team and Toys R Us (you had to be there) sadly devoid of Allens trademark one-liners. Its interesting to see Allen putting himself in the role of the older mentor rather than the romantic lead (a scene in an Army surplus store as he gives advice to Jerry feels exactly like his bookstore scene with Diane Keaton in ""Annie Hall""). But hes playing an idealized and almost sentimental character whos sort of a Greek chorus to Jerry -- an idea that was much funnier when Allen used a real Greek chorus in ""Mighty Aphrodite."" Now nearing 70 Allen still makes a movie a year; perhaps its time to slow down while his great movies are still within memory. I cant imagine what a moviegoer unfamiliar with Allens work might make of ""Anything Else""; while a disappointing Allen movie is still better than most movies out there its a shadow of what he could once do. In ""Annie Hall"" we knew Annie and Alvy werent meant for each other but we rooted for them anyway. Theres no one to root for in ""Anything Else"" except perhaps Billie Holiday whose croony laid-back rendition of ""Easy to Love"" deserves a place in a better movie.

Starring Jason Biggs Christina Ricci and Woody Allen. Directed by Woody Allen. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Woody Allen tries to pass the romantic torch to a new generation of young actors in ""Anything Else."" He takes Jason Biggs (""American Pie"") and Christina Ricci both in their 20s and stars them in the sort of relationship comedy that he might have written for himself years ago. But this seemingly good idea results in disaster. Allen has no insight into the current generation of young people and his film is just a jumbled rehash of themes and motifs that hes explored elsewhere. It has taken Allen over 30 years but he has finally made a movie thats almost unwatchable. It seems a contradiction to say it Allen has nothing to say in ""Anything Else"" and hes said it all before. That is the elements are familiar but theyre joined together here in the service of a film thats ultimately pointless. PHONY PHONY PHONY Biggs is no surrogate for Allen. When he steps away from the action and addresses the audience directly as Allen himself did in ""Annie Hall"" ""Manhattan"" and other films he looks like a student council candidate making a speech. Hes not inherently funny. Nor is he believable as a person with serious concerns about mortality and the meaning of existence. He looks like any normal healthy boring young man. He plays Jerry an up-and-coming comedy writer who is also at work on a morbid pessimistic novel. Yet despite being a hard worker and a thinker he expends most of his mental energy worrying over his relationship with Amanda (Ricci) a neurotic unfaithful and ungiving young woman whom no one with an ounce of self-esteem would tolerate for five minutes. Or at most a week. Amanda is a nightmare figure the sort of character that can get a male writer accused of misogyny. She lives with Jerry but wont sleep with him even as she cheats on him with various strangers. Yet in the scheme of ""Anything Else"" its understood -- though the audience never understands it -- that shes incredibly desirable and interesting. As for Jerry hes taken with her from their first meeting when he discovers that she likes Humphrey Bogart. Oh yes and Billie Holiday. Thats how it is with young couples today constantly bonding over cultural icons who died in the 1950s. Later they go to a New York club to hear Diana Krall sing old standards. The whole Bogart-Holiday-Krall element is phony in at least three ways 1) Its phony in the traditional way of Allen movies -- the men are supposedly attracted to women based on their cultural sensibilities when in fact the attraction is patently physical and nothing more; 2) Its phony in that 20- year-olds even if they were into Bogart or Holiday would talk about them the way they do here -- as if everyone were familiar with their work; and 3) Its phony with regard to Amandas personality. If she liked Bogart and Holiday shed be a different person. Probably a better person. So ""Anything Else"" is a time warp. EXTRA TALENT LOST Allens resume makes it possible for him to attract top talent for smallish parts and so we find Stockard Channing in the thankless role of Amandas selfish harridan of a mother who moves into Amanda and Jerrys apartment and dominates their lives. Danny DeVito plays Jerrys tightly wound agent an extraneous role that could easily have been left on the cutting-room floor. Throughout ""Anything Else"" its difficult to get a grip on the focus or intent of the story. The first lines of the film belong to Allen himself who plays a sour struggling comedy writer. He sits on a park bench talking to Jerry about the ""seminal"" jokes that define their existence an opening that calls to mind the opening monologue in ""Annie Hall."" The opening makes one expect a film about Dobel (Allen) and Jerrys efforts to work together as writers. But then the movie careens into sex farce while seeming to be about Jerrys earnest journey toward philosophical understanding. Only theres nothing to understand. The title itself -- the equivalent of ""whatever"" -- indicates a kind of throwing up of the hands on Allens part a surrender to the senselessness of the tale which he tries to fob off as the senselessness of existence. No sale. Its hard to imagine why Allen bothered to write ""Anything Else"" and having written it why he thought it was worth filming. There was the hope before this film was released that ""Anything Else"" might indicate a new direction for Allen. The French filmmaker Eric Rohmer is in his 80s and still makes romances. Why couldnt Allen do the same? But ""Anything Else"" convinces me that Allen has never been all that interested in romance after all just sex and sexual politics. And sexual politics change from generation to generation. This is not fertile ground for this 67-year-old artist. Alas it seems that Allen sooner or later is going to have to concentrate on grown-up things.-- This film contains sex talk and a scene of drug use.

Biggs grating portrayal however is like some aggressive bass player fingernail-plucking your most sensitive brain waves. Ditto for the movie overall though Id rather say anything else than this. (Related item See a clip from Anything Else) Amanda (Christina Ricci) is good at reassuring her skeptical boyfriend Jerry (Jason Biggs) in Anything Else. By Myles Aronowitz AP Set in New York and one of the very few Allen films in which the real Woody is seen driving a car this brutally overlong comedy (108 minutes) casts the two actors as comedy writers with an obvious age difference and about as much career success as the flea-bitten showbiz acts that graced Allens Broadway Danny Rose. More about the movie Anything Else   (out of four) Stars Woody Allen Jason Biggs Christina Ricci Danny DeVito Stockard Channing Director Woody Allen Distributor DreamWorks Rating R for a scene of drug use and some sexual references Opens today nationwide Having romanced Tea Leoni in last years far more chuckle-prone Hollywood Ending Allen 67 now wisely leaves the romancing to his younger co-star. In a movie in which nearly every principal is a head case Christina Ricci pulls girlfriend duty once Biggs dumps his more stable live-in (KaDee Strickland) after becoming instantly smitten with acting hopeful Ricci. Working out neuroses and frequently talking about them directly to the audience Biggs ponders his dilemmas. Does he want to keep writing comedy or gravitate toward serious books? Does he want anvil-ish Allen as his partner? Does he want to dump his longtime manager (funny Danny De-Vito) who takes 25%? Biggs problem on the last two fronts He cant say no. Thats why he also gets steamrolled by Riccis wannabe-chanteuse mother (Stockard Channing) who moves into their already cramped apartment and then compounds the felony by renting a piano. This sounds as if it ought to be funny but like so much else here intent and execution keep missing each other. The same isnt true cosmetically because Allen now adds another great cinematographer to past A-list collaborators Darius Khondji who shot Seven Evita and Bernardo Bertoluccis Stealing Beauty. Yet this only points up how much of a detrimental grind it is hearing Biggs whine and intone then intone and whine while screenwriter Allen sticks himself with what sounds like dialogue from the attic. In the old days Allens own whining was hilarious. Even Kenneth Branaghs Allen stand-in as the lead in 1998s whoppingly underrated Celebrity was softer. Its asking a lot of audiences to spend nearly two hours with characters as screen-unfriendly as the ones played by Biggs and Ricci though both actors (and especially Ricci) do what theyre asked to do. Their misery however isnt tempered by laughs. Though one can probably get excommunicated from a critics fraternity sorority or co-ed mixer for saying so the American Pie movies (gulp or more aptly burp) have more of them.

Is there anything else Allen can say more than a quarter of a century later about nebbishy hyperarticulate men and the crazy women who arouse them to connect with the moviegoing kids today? Maybe some reliable jokes about death and God and Jews and psychotherapy and Auschwitz - something for the new generation for whom phrases like ""dead shark"" mean nothing? How about if ""Anything Else"" werent marketed as a Woody Allen movie but instead as a boppy Manhattan love struggle between well-known twentysomething pop actors Jason Biggs and Christina Ricci? Would that help pull in a younger demographic? In fact with every recycled piece of business - which is to say every scene in ""Anything Else"" - the distance widens between Allen and the elusive audience he pessimistically chases. He has never seemed less in touch with his own real pulsing 21st-century city or more foppish in his references to Camus and on-the-couch psychoanalysis. I cant imagine what a stranger to ""Annie Hall"" would make of it all. Biggs may play Jerry Falk an aspiring comedy writer but the actors gestures and stuttering hysteria-prone delivery are worn borrowed 1970s Allenisms giving Falk the appearance of a young fogey whose shrink is a silent Freudian and whose tastes run to Billie Holiday and Cole Porter. (Kenneth Branagh similarly parroted Allens speech patterns in ""Celebrity."") Ricci is no Diane Keaton - her sexiness is small and tough not lanky and kooky - but her Amanda occupies a familiar time-warped position of unreliability dither and eventual sexual boredom leading to unfaithfulness. If anything women appear to frighten and disgust the filmmaker even more in the new millennium While Amanda tortures her boyfriend with an acrid combination of narcissism and self-hatred simultaneously whining about how ""fat"" she is and fancying herself a femme fatale Amandas mother played by Stockard Channing is a boozy pushy man-hungry tornado of middle-aged demands. ""Anything Else"" is about the romantic difficulties between Falk (who is always called Falk) and Amanda with commentary by Allen as Falks crotchety friend and mentor David Dobel (who is always called Dobel). Its also about the creative difficulties between Allen and the city he clearly loves - only more in memory than in reality. Shot in a style that could either be called 1970s-nostalgia-fade or imprecise-low-budget-blotchiness and filled with long static takes in which characters recite worn aphorisms (Dobel calls Falks schlemiel of a manager played by Danny DeVito a ""member of the lost tribes of Israel who should stay lost"") the movie trails malaise in its wake. A scene in which Amandas mother toots cocaine off the cover of Falks laptop is dust compared with Alvy Singers cocaine sneeze back in 1977 and I miss Alvy every time Biggs Falk turns to talk to the camera. ""Idiots who are total losers in New York go to Los Angeles and become millionaires"" Dobel tells Falk. Not with comedies like this one.

In his impressive body of work Woody Allen has repeatedly depicted the battle of the sexes with humor and insight usually playing the character buffeted by passions ebb and flow himself. In ""Anything Else"" Jason Biggs plays the guy with the sexual hang-ups who with a confident stab at the quintessential Allen screw-up proves theres more to life than ""American Pie."" The younger casting brings a freshness to the material and with Allen as the weird mentor there are plenty of laughs even if the pacings slow and the running time over-extended. A mid-range Allen pic is sharper than his latest offerings but very far from top form. B.O. prospects seem only marginally better than the recent Allen norm. Whats new in this Gotham-lensed comedy is a surprisingly dark element to the humor. Allen plays a sad-sack 60-year-old school teacher and would-be comic named David Dobel who becomes increasingly obsessive as the film proceeds. With a history of mental illness Dobel makes questionable jokes about the Holocaust and has a fetish about being an armed survivor in what he sees as perilous times. His close relationship with the 21-year-old Jerry Falk (Biggs) seems suffocating. Though Falk is at first pleased to have this wise erudite and opinionated man as his friend he eventually begins to find something a bit off-kilter about the relationship. Although Allen might have taken this shadowy side to his character to further extremes he only touches on it resulting in viewer frustration. Right from the opening credits designed in the now very familiar style and accompanied by Billie Holiday singing ""Easy to Love"" the viewer is inescapably in Allens New York. Early scenes set in Central Park establish the two main characters comedy writers who share a mournfully pessimistic attitude toward the human race. Falks hopeless agent Harvey (Danny DeVito) charges him 25% but although Harvey fails to get Falk much work Falk is too kind-hearted to give him the heave-ho. Falks also in analysis but his shrink (William Hill) is frustratingly unhelpful. In fact Falk has almost decided to quit writing comedy and is working on a gloomy-sounding novel. The one bright spot in his life he tells Dobel is his girlfriend Amanda (Christina Ricci) with whom hes been living for a year. Before they met he was living contentedly with Brooke (KaDee Strickland) but he fell for Amanda a would-be actress the moment they met. Before long Falk and Amanda were living together but passion all too soon gives way to rejection as Amanda calls a halt to sex for six months. When he arranges a romantic dinner at a tony restaurant to celebrate their first anniversary she turns up late and announces shes eaten already. Most of the film charts the ups and inevitable downs of this somewhat one-sided relationship. Matters arent helped by the arrival of Amandas mother Paula (Stockard Channing) who moves herself and her piano into their tiny apartment after the break-up of her latest relationship. Paula who fears getting old plans a new career as a night-club singer and one of the most touching moments in the film comes when in the wee small hours she insists Falk listen to her arrangement of the Peggy Lee song ""Therell Be Another Spring"" a sequence Channing performs most elegantly. When Dobel finally meets Amanda he instantly becomes convinced shes having an affair and suggests that Falk follow her when she leaves her acting class. The fears prove to be well founded. Much of ""Anything Else"" is quintessential Woody Allen; the ups and downs of love all of it served up with a wry ironic dash of humor. But the women characters are presented less sympathetically than they once were in Allens work with Amanda despite the sexiness and innate warmth Ricci brings to her character ultimately coming across as a scheming amoral two-timer and Paula a somewhat sad woman clinging desperately onto what remains of her youth. Its in the character of Dobel though that something really unsettling seems to have entered into this otherwise familiar world. Though Dobels insistence that his friend acquire a weapon and survival equipment in case the worst should happen is at first presented humorously Dobel is gradually revealed to be a violent and even murderous character. His caustic references to the Holocaust and to Jewish persecution eventually cast a bitter pall over the film as does the harsh treatment meted out to poor hopeless Harvey. One of Allens rare excursions into Scope ratio filmmaking ""Anything Else"" is very smoothly packaged and is backed by the usual wall-to-wall soundtrack of jazz and blues classics from the great composers. Allens dialogue crackles with quotable one-liners and his actors most of whom deliver their lines just like Allen himself are entirely up to their tasks with Biggs especially comfortable in the central role even in the scenes in which he steps out of character to address the audience directly.
