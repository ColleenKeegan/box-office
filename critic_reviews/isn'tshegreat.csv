The most commendable aspect of ""Isnt She Great"" Andrew Bergmans trashy biopic of bestselling novelist Jacqueline Susann is its brief running time. Bette Midler delivers one of her broadest performances as the writer whose sole motivation according to Paul Rudnicks shallow script was to become famous -- ""to be somebody"" as Susann says. Infused with a self-consciously campy sensibility Universal release may please undiscriminating moviegoevers who remember the celeb with particular appeal to gay men but rest of the audience is better off watching pics based on her pop novels (""Valley of the Dolls"" ""The Love Machine"" ""Once Is Not Enough"") than this cliched story of the woman who created them. Midway through the picture theres a scene in which Susann (Midler) and her loyal manager and hubby Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane) attend the Hollywood premiere of ""Valley of the Dolls."" ""Its not a good movie"" says the upset scribe to which her hubby says ""Dont worry itll be a huge hit."" But ""Isnt She Great"" is in no danger of becoming a hit. Veering from broad farce to sheer banality pic isnt even unintentionally funny enough to qualify as guilty pleasure a la ""Valley of the Dolls"" now a minor cult item. As he showed in his previous comedies (""The Addams Family Values"" ""Jeffrey"" ""In amp; Out"") Rudnick is a funny fellow but not a screenwriter overly concerned with plot machinations or characterization. Though based on Michael Kordas 1995 New Yorker essay Rudnicks schlocky yarn feels like an extended version of his monthly column in Premiere published under the pseudonym of Libby Gelman-Waxner. Rudnick is adept at one-liners most of which go to Stockard Channing who delivers them with great panache as Susanns bitchy self-absorbed actress friend. The rags-to-riches saga is presented as a story with a heart but whats missing is more brain. Susann began her career as an actress but with no agent and not much talent she scraped by with residuals from occasional radio jingles TV commercials and gameshow appearances. Undeterred by her failures Susann continued to seek her place in the spotlight believing -- and soon demonstrating -- that ""talent isnt everything."" Yarn is framed by Mansfields vapid unnecessary voiceover narration as if whats shown onscreen isnt clear enough. Susanns fortune changed upon meeting the manager-publicist a devoted man who knew he could fulfill her dreams. Married when they meet Susan is shocked when her husband Maury Manning (John Larroquette) leaves her. But the divorce clears the way to marriage with Mansfield who according to the script threw himself selflessly into helping her become rich and famous. With Susanns acting career going nowhere Mansfield hits upon a ""crazy"" idea Why not write a novel about what she knows well the steamy lives of drug-addicted sex-starved starlets. That Susann had never before written a word is perceived as a minor obstacle and she and Mansfield convince themselves that the public is thirsty for lurid stories about aging stars hopeful hookers and pill-popping women who wind up in the gutter. Despite rejections from the more reputable publishers Susann lands a contract with Henry Marcus (John Cleese) who assigns her manuscript to stuffy editor Michael Hastings (David Hyde Pierce). Hereon the story changes gears centering on the sobering education that Hastings gets from Susann to the point where he like everybody else becomes an admirer. The filmmakers label their tale as ""loosely based"" on Susanns life presenting her uncritically as brave bright and loyal to her friends. They focus on Susanns ambition to succeed at all costs and on her determination never to allow her personal tragedies to become public. In actuality Susanns life was marked by disaster She had an autistic child and was diagnosed with breast cancer. There are brief throwaway scenes that acknowledge these catastrophes particularly her precarious health which ended her life at the age of 53. Aspects of Susanns life and career go unaddressed here. Among other things she is credited with being the most successful novelist of her generation and for inventing a whole new way of marketing and selling books; she and Mansfield embarked on a coast-to-coast book tour paying calls to the smallest regional bookstores. What makes the movie insufferable is not only its showbiz cliches but its excessive theatrical sensibility. The material is filtered through Rudnicks campy gay humor which veers away from fact -- Susann was witty but not a ""funny"" personality and her marriage was more complex than depicted here. The theatrical tone is most awkward in the periodic trips that Susann and Mansfield take to Central Park where they talk to God whining about their lot or reporting their success. These pauses which almost call out for musical numbers suggest that the yarn is better suited to Broadway than the bigscreen. Lane is basically miscast but mercifully he underacts. Midler whos too old to be Susann in the 60s (the writer was 35 when her first book got published) plays Susann big as a charming vulgarian a modern version of ""Gypsys"" aggressive mom and ""Fiddler on the Roofs"" Yente. Bergman has never been a subtle comedy director but here his broad muddled staging accentuates the cliches. Barry Malkins editing is fast-paced but ragged making pic seem more meandering than it is and Julie Weiss tacky costumes are often more amusing than the characters wearing them.

Starring Bette Midler Nathan Lane Stockard Channing David Hyde Pierce John Cleese Amanda Peet. Directed by Andrew Bergman. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There is such a thing as depressing comedy. ""Isnt She Great"" the new biopic on schlock novelist Jacqueline Susann (""Valley of the Dolls"") starring Bette Midler as the fame-crazy author leaves an unintentional unpleasant aftertaste. Its more than just a question of who would want to see a movie about one of the worst novelists of the late 20th century. The depressing aftereffect is disconcerting because the film opening today at Bay Area theaters and co-starring Nathan Lane as Susanns manager and husband Irving Mansfield is played as a comedy of bubbly 60s glitz. Midler does the Auntie Mame bit in her often coarse jokes-by-the- numbers characterization of Susann. She paints the author of the trashy novels ""The Love Machine"" and ""Once Is Not Enough"" as more glamorous party-mad goofball than extreme neurotic with a fixation on self-aggrandizement that could by all other accounts be punishing to those around her. Ultimately ""Isnt She Great"" is so loosely based on the real woman that its fancy with a sprinkling of facts. Two issues darken the merry vulgarity of Susanns story. One is the trivialization of breast cancer (from which Susann who hid it from everybody died in 1974 at the age of 56). Another is trivializing reference to her sons autism -- the boy was institutionalized at infancy and if we are to believe this film was only sporadically visited by Susann. As a showbiz story ""Isnt She Great"" tends to work OK even if theres no display (fortunately) of the subjects talents. The showbiz feel is the films main aim inferred by the casting of klieg-light legends Midler and Lane and by delineating Susann as a wannabe who succeed ed in gaining the world fame of an entertainer. She got the worlds attention by writing trashy books and personally pushing them on her ""audience"" of everyday folks. She was the queen of lowbrow novel writing that changed the face of publishing by identifying a mass market and aggressively pursuing it. Even as a best-selling author Susann was a joke for anybody who ever cared about good writing. As an amusing look at self-invention and bravado the film (loosely based by screenwriter Paul Rudnick on a 1995 New Yorker magazine article by Michael Korda) works. Midler in kitschy clothes creates a fun portrait of a kick-ass gal. Susann failed as an actress and ran with the notion (suggested by her husband) that writing books about sex and sin among the glamorous and those yearning to be could be her ""act."" The film would be a Midler tour de force were it not for spirited performances by Stockard Channing as Susanns best friend Florence David Hyde Pierce (""Frasier"") as the editor disdainful of her amateurish writing talents and John Cleese as her market-savvy publisher. And about the missing question mark in the title . . . obviously somebody thought ahead and realized that the most likely answer would be ""no"" had that question mark been added. ..

Bette Midler as Jacqueline Susann one of the best-selling authors of the 60s and 70s flounces from one room to the next clad in outfits that look like theyve been grabbed off the lower-bourgeois rack of the swinging 60s - frilly pink dresses a skintight leopard-spotted pantsuit and so forth. The clothes unfortunately are all there is to the character. Susann who starts out as an actress announces with Napoleonic will her desire to be famous and she meets up with a fawning manager-publicist Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane) who devotes his life to making that dream come true. But what does she have that no one else does? From what we can see Susann is a minor Broadway and TV-commercial performer of no discernible talent beauty or connections. When she decides to write an epic salacious novel based on her mountain of ""inside knowledge"" about the dirty secrets of the entertainment industry its a bizarre and baffling turn of events because weve never seen her experience - or even talk about - a single party or closed-door showbiz encounter. Jacqueline Susann was nothing if not a maestro of sleaze but there isnt a whisper of good dish in ""Isnt She Great."" The movie leaves out the true juice of Susanns vulgarity; it reduces Midler the great bawd to a toothless Catskills comic. There are references to Susanns autistic son and her ongoing bout with breast cancer but as tragic as these true-life circumstances are you get the feeling that Rudnick and the director Andrew Bergman (Striptease) thought that all they had to do was glance at them once in a while to create instant drama. ""Isnt She Great"" is an oxymoron camp thats been drained of mockery. The movie would like to salute Jacqueline Susanns novels as cathartic trash but the film itself is so junky it never earns the right.
