(If Nick catches the villain his sentence will be commuted.) The director Michael Mann offers some dazzling computer graphics to conjure the electron flux on which the modern world works but then abandons them for the methodical plotting of a sprawling disconnected neutered thriller. Nick quickly morphs from a digital wizard into a standard-issue paramilitary superhero; he and Dawais sister Chen Lien (Tang Wei) fall in love and join forces in what becomes a jet-setting international caper. Though Mann stages a few striking shoot-outs shows some gore and delivers some topical references to cyber-politics he cant mask the over-all sense of a mere simulacrum of characters action and for that matter thrills.

"Blackhat - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Blackhat Posted by Christy Lemire on January 17 2015 5 Comments Universal Pictures Rated R for violence and some language. Running time 133 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. The notion of a terrible Michael Mann movie seems like an oxymoron. It doesnt make any sense coming from the man behind ""Heat"" and ""The Insider"" and ""Collateral."" But theres a reason that ""Blackhat"" a Michael Mann movie starring a major movie star in Chris Hemsworth is opening in the dead of January because it is indeed terrible. Even Manns recent minor efforts - films like 2009s ""Public Enemies"" and his big-screen version of ""Miami Vice"" in 2006 - pulsated with some sort of energy. They buzzed with some sort of tension. Hes always been a meticulous stickler for style so the imagery in these later films is usually enthralling even when the characters or the story arent. But even Manns signature vibe - a combination of sleekness and muscularity gloss and grit - cant distract from the ridiculousness of ""Blackhat"" or enliven its prevailing tedium. Lets start with the fact that Hemsworth stars as the worlds most brilliant hacker. Let that sink in for a moment. As a bad casting choice its up there with Tara Reid playing a brilliant archaeologist in Uwe Bolls 2005 video game adaptation ""Alone in the Dark"" - or Hemsworths younger brother Liam playing a brilliant tech guru in the 2013 thriller ""Paranoia."" This is not a slam on Hemsworth who has a strong film presence that extends beyond playing the blonde hulking Thor in various Marvel summer blockbusters. He showed both swagger and smarts as racecar driver James Hunt in Ron Howards ""Rush."" Hes always had a bit of a young Brad Pitt about him in his combination of spectacular good looks with a sense of humor to match. Here hes just horribly miscast. Anyone who makes his or her way in the world sitting in front of a computer screen all day is not going to look as hunky as Hemsworth. Theyre probably also going to wear shirts more frequently than he does in ""Blackhat."" And they probably wont possess the bad-assery required to dominate any fistfight/shootout/name a deadly situation the way his character Nick Hathaway does. He also dominates the prison where hes serving 13 years for hacking theft. Thats where we first meet him in ""Blackhat"" and where he first reveals his unwaveringly stoic demeanor. At the films start we watched as a mysterious faceless hacker caused an explosion at a nuclear plant in Hong Kong. Next he used his malware to send soy prices soaring at the exchange in Chicago. Mann depicts the deluge of damaging data in the form of tiny white blips traveling through cables and circuitry; they begin as a trickle but turn into a tidal wave. Its a rather cool-looking trick the first time and it kicks things off with some energetic visual imagery; from there though much of what actually drives the narrative consists of people sitting in front of laptops click-clacking away furiously with their brows furrowed as is so often the case in such high-tech capers. This one-two punch of attacks prompts the Chinese and United States governments to work together in a partnership. Viola Davis provides a rare source of substance and a human connection as a tough FBI agent while an elegant Wang Leehom plays the Chinese investigator who just happens to have been Nicks roommate at MIT. Wangs character Chen Dawai knows Nick is the only person who could possibly get to the bottom of who wrote this code because as it turns out hes the one who wrote an early version of it. Once Chen and Davis Carol Barrett arrange for Nicks release on furlough Morgan Davis Foehls script sends them on a globetrotting adventure from Los Angeles to Hong Kong to Jakarta to track down the culprit before he can strike again. (What this person ultimately is after is incredibly lame and anticlimactic but I wont spoil it for you.) Also along for the ride is Chens sister Lien played in stiff monotone fashion by Tang Wei. Chen says he wants her as part of the team because he needs someone he can trust; in truth though shes there to serve as eye candy and a laughable love interest for Nick. Attractive as they both are individually Hemsworth and Tang have zero chemistry with each other. The supposed romance that blossoms between them comes out of nowhere makes no sense and is entirely needless. More effective though are the violent set pieces Mann stages -- unsurprising given that these are his bread and butter. His use of digital video during a fistfight at a neon-bathed Koreatown restaurant makes it feel both garish and kinetic. The pop of gunfire and metal during a lengthy shootout amid giant cargo containers provides its own tense rhythm. Such startling bursts of brutal energy provide the rare thrills in a film that more often feels like an overlong slog. In theory ""Blackhat"" couldnt be more timely given that it arrives on the heels of a hack attack that shook Sony Pictures to its core. But for Mann itll end up being a blip in an otherwise massive career. Tweet Category Recovered Reviews Tags action Chris Hemsworth Collateral Heat Miami Vice Michael Mann Public Enemies Tang Wei The Insider Thor thriller Viola Davis Wang Leehom 5 Comments on ""Blackhat"" January 17 2015  by  George     Mann for me is the most interesting director to shoot night skylines. The combination of his city night-shooting with the soundtrack he puts is superb. And then...theres the screenplay. Oh boy. What can someone say? I dont want to spoil anything so Ill describe this as vaguely as I can but there is a scene in the movie showing a huge parade of Indonesian people. And among them one man points a gun to another man and the other man stabs him and kills him. And NOBODY of these Indonesian people sees anything And it happens right in front of them Logic flew out of the window in this scene As for Hemsworth sure I also found it difficult to believe that this gorgeous tall blonde guy is a hacker. But then again I thought isnt this interesting? What did you want to see again? A four eyed 30 year old virgin with pimples on his face talking with numbers and codes instead of words? Wouldnt this be TYPECASTING? So yeah believe it or not (me you and whoever) it is possible that there are some hackers in this world that are HANDSOME And about his builded body well he said it himself there are two things to do in prison reading and exercising And I think he was good in the movie. Actually I think its his best performance after ""Rush"". Hemsworth was not the problem. All actors were good in the movie (Viola Davis so good). The problem is that in almost every Mann movie some scenes defy logic and I dont understand why he does it. Hes sabotaging his own movies. But anyway I think that ""Blackhat"" was not that terrible as you and people say. Yes it was a bit long and its hard to believe that all these could happen but a) it didnt bore me b) his directing style is so attractive that makes it easier to watch. I mean if that screenplay had an indifferent director then it would be an utter bore. Reply January 18 2015  by  Carlos Daniel     I do love Manns ""Collateral"" but ""Heat"" felt exactly like you describe Blackhat an overlong boring slog which occasionally comes to life during violent set pieces. Reply January 20 2015  by  Max Yin     This review is precisely what I want to say on every point. ""Heat"" is one of my all-time favorite if not the one. But ""Blackhat"" only left with me wondering ""Why would you make this?"" Reply February 8 2015  by  Patrick B     As bad as this was it is miles better than Manns Miami Vice. That is the real blemish on his career. Reply Pingback Blackhat-We are no longer in control. | Find movies with solarmovie.xyz Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jan 16 2015 Culture The director Michael Mann has many many devoted fans and I do not particularly count myself among them. Though I consider The Insider to be among the most underappreciated films of the last 25 years Heat left me cold--yes you may stop reading now if you wish--and I thought Collateral wound up in default. All three however along with his superior The Last of The Mohicans were at least memorable big-screen expansions of the style and sensibility that he began developing on television so many years ago.Alas since those days Mann seems to have entered an era of contraction with the forgettable Public Enemies the best-forgotten Miami Vice and now the Im-forgetting-it-already Blackhat. Though his fans will find consolations scattered throughout this lumbering cyberthriller seems less like an actual Michael Mann film than like the work of an inferior imitator.Related Story 26 Movies to Look Forward to in 2015 The movie begins with a catastrophe at a Chinese power plant a malicious little worm of code has wriggled its way into the system and shut down turbines in the cooling pool leading to a reactor breach and the threat of meltdown. The young Chinese cyber-security official placed in charge of the investigation (played by Wang Leehom) requests and is granted a joint investigation with an American counter-terrorism official (Viola Davis). To round out his international action team he chooses with immaculate implausibility his younger sister Lien Chen (Tang Wei) whom he brings along because he ""needs someone he can trust""; and his former college roommate Nicholas Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth). Complicating matters Hathaway is a felon currently serving an extended sentence for stealing tens of millions of dollars from a series of banks. (Not to worry we are later reminded with simple-minded satisfaction He only stole from banks not people.)Hemsworth has evinced genuine star power over the course of two Thors an Avengers a Cabin in the Woods and the criminally underrated Rush. But he is flat-out awful as the M.I.T.-certified tech genius Hathaway. (Nothing against the erstwhile Asgardian but you dont hire him principally for his coding.) Hemsworth grunts and grumbles his way through the role in what seems to be a foreigners idea of a tough-guy American accent (the actor is himself Australian) a parody of Kurt Russell doing his longstanding parody of John Wayne.Tang is also a gifted actress (as she demonstrated in Ang Lees Lust Caution) but she fares no better in a woefully underwritten eye-candy role. Though in theory a computer expert herself we see less of her character at a keyboard than in Hathaways bed the two having fallen for one another almost immediately in one of the laziest and most chemistry-free onscreen romances in years. ""I believe you a very strong man a very smart man"" she tells him through heavily accented English in a scene that feels about 50 years out of date.The less said of the plot the better. Hathaway and Chen track their cyber-terrorist from L.A. to Hong Kong to Jakarta in a cat-and-mouse game that doesnt bother introducing the mouse until the final reel. There are foot chases and shootouts--the latter conducted with confusing geometry at intolerable volume--and noble sacrifices and perhaps the single least surprising surprise car explosion in cinematic history. And while its all given Manns customary wash of testosterone at no time does it feel as though the directors heart is in the project.And ""project"" is exactly what Blackhat feels like a film so calculated in its commercialism that it feels as though it may have been spit out of some Hollywood algorithm for profitability. A particular low point in the film is the ham-fisted product placement in which Hathaway states his specific need for an Android phone. But an ever-present and far more depressing feature is the movies naked pandering for overseas box office. There is of course nothing wrong with films that feature an international cast and Far East settings--except when those appear to be the entire economic rationale undergirding them.Mann has entered an era of contraction with the forgettable Public Enemies the best-forgotten Miami Vice and the Im-forgetting-it-already Blackhat.As we saw with the middling Pacific Rim the last as-awful-as-expected Transformers installment and the almost indescribably idiotic Lucy if theres one thing worse than appealing to the lowest common American denominator its appealing to the lowest common global denominator. The typical symptoms are all in evidence here dialogue that seems written for optimal ease in subtitling; emotions so loud flat and emphatically stated that they cannot possibly be misunderstood; the erasure of any hint of political controversy (the higher-ups in Chinese intelligence actually behave better than their American counterparts); and of course as many easy-to-translate explosions and eruptions of automatic-weapons fire as can be comfortably accommodated.There was a time when Michael Mann helped set the agenda for action filmmaking. Now it seems he merely succumbs to it.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed.

James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

"Swerve and Protect Wanting More From Blackhat Taken 3 and The Wedding Ringer << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Swerve and Protect Wanting More From Blackhat Taken 3 and The Wedding Ringer Universal Pictures Movies January 16 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Michael Manns Blackhat is a paranoia thriller that treats computer code the way most movies treat serial killers. In the opening minutes the camera surfs along cables weaves between chips pinballs amid circuitry. Its interested in everything screens of numbers blips pulses and lasers. Mann is trying to personify information to give it a point of view the way The Silence of the Lambs plunked you down in the basement lair of Buffalo Bill. The movie isnt as visually or psychologically arresting but it has a decent ludicrousness and Manns one-of-a-kind talent for using digital photography and naturalistic light to complicate and invigorate anonymous spaces. Lots of non-science fiction thrillers are ultimately about the fear of advancing technology. Theyre not sci-fi because science has already run amok. There are hackers. There is government and corporate spying. And it doesnt take much for computer networks and surveillance systems (or their anonymous human exponents) to come chasing after you. That was the sickening allure of everything from Francis Ford Coppolas The Conversation (with Gene Hackman as a genius eavesdropper) and John Badhams WarGames to Tony Scotts Enemy of the State and Laura Poitrass Citizenfour It might already be too late. For about 10 minutes Blackhat generates intrigue in part by showing us the technology doing its psychotic thing. All that fiber-optic coursing culminates in an explosion at a Chinese nuclear reactor. Then we see the blips and cables and pulses reach the claw of a chip and soy futures soar through the roof. Soon were hopscotching between a pair of FBI agents Barrett and Pollack (played by Viola Davis and John Ortiz respectively); and Chen (Wang Leehom) an MIT-educated Chinese cyber-criminologist and his old classmate Nick (Chris Hemsworth) who for reasons known only to a Hollywood movie needs to be sprung from prison to help solve this case. ""So good to see you bro"" says Chen during a long embrace with Nick that Agent Barrett and Chens hacker sister (Tang Wei) are parked outside the prison to witness. Nick had been in the middle of serving a 15-year sentence for stealing millions from four big banks. But someones using a sloppy version of code he wrote to commit seemingly unrelated acts of terrorism and sabotage. As a deal to help solve the case he wants his sentence commuted. The script is credited to Morgan Davis Foehl and at this point he had me. Wheres this going? For one thing into the land of compujargon. Theres talk of edge routers and optical overlay networks. Among the Chinese theres bad dubbing and elsewhere dull exploratory excursions. And while Barrett and Chen work angles on their side of the film Nick and the sister wind up working each others angles. (To be fair hed been in prison for a minute.) But this of course turns a film about cybercrime into a film at least partially about fucking hackers. What you realize as theyre gazing at each other and as you watch their lovemaking is that these two are terrible together. Tang is lost in her many English-speaking scenes presumably having been hired for the sex she had in Ang Lees Lust Caution. Theres often little more for her to do than stare at the top of Hemsworths head as he hacks hunkily away in a dingy flat. But you start to doubt a movie that gives this much screen time to an actress whos that in over her head when in Davis theres a star on the other side of the movie exuding cool control. And what if she and Hemsworth had switched parts? Because while the movies -- and People magazine -- believe in Hemsworths sexiness falling for it is a kind of false worship. He walks around with shirts open to the middle of his chest as though he were James Caan in 1973. But Caan had the cockiness (OK gall) to open his to his navel. Hemsworth is missing that kind of gumption. Hes got an empty smolder like a grill after youve dumped out the coals. But it turns out that when he isnt forced to be concerned with sex when the movie lets him charge ahead with the narrative he becomes sexy in a young Jan-Michael Vincent sort of way. When Hemsworth finally puts all the plot pieces together (thank you screenplay) hes standing well above sea level speaking to no one in whatever accent hes decided to give himself ""Thats what youre doing isnt it you son of a bitch?"" By this point the movie has turned into something ripe and pulpy. Nick breaks into the NSAs system. And later when he does more pivotal hacking youll never guess the color of his baseball cap. You come to appreciate the films fondness for Nicks criminality even as it baffles (if the hat fits I guess). By that point Mann has already staged one shootout at a dockyard among shipping containers and another on an empty street at night (the veteran Holt McCallany plays the U.S. Marshal on the FBIs team; hes got the sort of unfussy masculinity Manns movies thrive on). These sequences arent Heat-caliber. But Mann puts his foot in them anyway lingering with love over the face of one dead character and letting the sound guys leave you feeling as though youve been riddled with bullets too. The whole thing culminates in an excitingly done increasingly despicable nighttime showdown at a Jakarta street festival whose vastness seems meant to hide its participants from each other. We never see the faces of the marchers but when a melee inevitably erupts and the knives and guns come out the marchers are shoved in and out of the way. Theyre made disposable for our entertainment. The movie has long given up on giving technology a point of view and turns rather suddenly into another asinine occasion to bulldoze a culture that has no point of view in Hollywood.  Sam Urdank/Europacorp I guess theres no point in asking who wants another Taken sequel. By a wide margin the latest and allegedly last installment -- Taken 3 -- is no. 1 at the box office. Volume 2 set largely in Istanbul made a wishful rooftop leap into the Bourne movies but crashed through a window into a bad 24 plot. Having Liam Neesons CIA operative hell-bent on revenge Bryan Mills team up with a blonde nincompoop daughter named Kim (Maggie Grace) only enhanced the TV comparison. But oh the magical shenanigans of Taken 2 It warranted a space in the dumb action hall of fame. (Heres an incomplete transcript of a jailed Mills stealing a cell-phone call to Kim ""Take a shoelace from one of my shoes in the closet ... Draw another circle with the market in the center ... I want you to go to the parking lot with the grenade ... I want you to pull the pin on the grenade ... Now I want you to draw a circle on the map ... I want you to take one of the guns and two of the grenades and go up to the roof ... Set off another grenade ... Drop the gun down the vent Kim and run ... "") Well Kim runs into part three a movie that thinks the way to earn our knuckle-biting is to be as dull as hell for 35 minutes then send a giant shipping container hurtling along the interstate. But you yawn through that too. Its all brought to you by the same outfit that made the first two Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen on script with Olivier Megaton directing. This being a Besson production it attains some lunacy but hardly anything comparable to Taken 2 which had lost the antsy defensiveness of the ludicrous first movie a story of a divorced dad trying to reassert his fatherly primacy with karate chops swinging kicks and action doubles. After all that its honestly surprising theres anything left to take. Alas however he arrives from a jog to his Los Angeles apartment one morning only to find the dead body of his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). But she just texted him a bagel order Of course the cops think Bryan did it. Of course Bryan runs. Of course the detective on the case is Forest Whitaker who fiddles with such props as rubber bands and discarded chess pieces (its a knight and it takes nothing). Whenever Bryan gets close to Kim whos distraught over her mother worried for her father and expecting Whitaker gets a feeling and goes nuts and orders the officers hes got surveilling Kim to get after her. At this point you could stay home and fire up The Fugitive. The plot hides amid a bonanza of convenience-store trips diner scenes and lots of shots of bagels. It does so while climbing a ladder of nonsense that leads to the sort of ugly-looking Russian goon who in anticipation of a business deal actually makes time for gross hot-tub nuzzling with two ladies. Never fear -- with these movies the ladder always has another rung. But its also the kind of film that telegraphs what that rung is long before any sort of climax gets going. All the exceptional stunt work of the first movie and action orchestration of the second are an uninspired mess of visual incoherence. When Bryan and his car are run over the side of a cliff you can set your watch for the flashback that explains his escape. Neeson owns these movies and this new bad-ass phase of his career. Other middle-aged stars have followed suit with suave turns in kill-everybody action thrillers -- Kevin Costner Denzel Washington and soon Sean Penn. Neeson gives his incarnation heartache and loneliness. He performs. His intolerance for the execrable extends from the characters to the actors playing them. Dougray Scott plays Lenores husband Stuart and before getting to the Russians Bryan leaves himself no choice but to waterboard Stuart. As bad as Scott is (hes not even winking) this is excessive and as the Senate Intelligence Committees recent torture report confirmed not terribly effective. (Again so many rungs.) Neeson looks good. He just doesnt look fast. Bryans escape from the LAPD by foot and by fence-scaling constitutes satire. This is one of the most hectically edited movies Ive ever seen (I dont think theres an action shot that exceeds three seconds). But the cutting cant disguise Neesons slowness. American law enforcement has been under a lot of stress and scrutiny lately. But failing to catch a big-ass 62-year-old Irish dude running through alleyways and living rooms will only add insult to injury.  Matt Kennedy/Screen Gems A reliable authority swears to me that an algorithm didnt write the new Kevin Hart movie; humans did. But The Wedding Ringer feels spat out for people who love Katherine Heigl movies but wish that Eddie Murphy were in her role instead. Instead of mid-1980s Murphy though they get Hart who tries to do for this movie what Will Smith did for a similar matchmaking scenario in Hitch make it fizzy. Like Hitch The Wedding Ringer is all but stolen by the corpulent costar who needs a smooth black male to save him from haplessness (its Josh Gad now; then it was Kevin James). There are slabs of Wedding Crashers stabs at the painfully funny physicality of the Farrelly brothers something like the finale of The Graduate and the sort of approach to bromance that errs relentlessly -- though neither insultingly nor all that cluelessly -- on the side of gay. Harts Jimmy Callahan runs a business specializing in providing best-man services to friendless grooms. Gads character Doug calls on him 10 days before his wedding to a woman (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) who he feels is too hot for him. He has fewer friends than he has let on to her. But for 50000 (plus expenses) Jimmy pulls together a team of groomsmen and throws him a bachelor party. The short notice means the groomsmen are largely idiots and weirdos. One is a fat loser (Jorge Garcia). The Asian American one has a third testicle. Anothers a white sleazed-up ex-con (Colin Kane) who preys on women and has raped men. Doug is appalled but maybe these misfits (and criminals) are the bros hes always wanted. The number of soundtracked montages Doug and Jimmy share makes the average Heigl movie seem like Birdman. In the meantime they find themselves drawn to one other and each time they have a moment Jimmy has to redraw a professional line the way Julia Roberts kept telling Richard Gere she doesnt kiss johns on the mouth. Jeremy Garelick directed The Wedding Ringer from a script credited to him and to Jay Lavender and they seem scared of how much smarter this movie couldve been. The filmmakers unleash noisy party scenes sequences that appear to have been edited with a Vitamix and a basset hound that comes down with lockjaw while licking Gads penis. That last bit -- along with a couple of other nominally funny asides -- are intended to bring down the house. The wedding planner is an over-the-top gay queen (Ignacio Serricchio). At some point Dougs grandmother (Cloris Leachman) catches fire at a dinner table and nearly burns down the house. And Dougs coarse macho future father-in-law (Ken Howard) challenges Dougs masculinity by assembling a football team that includes Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones and a mad-dog Joe Namath. This is drive-thru comedy. The sugar grease and salt will make it a hit. But theres a far more interesting sophisticated work of cynical farce between the films two sesame-seeded buns. Olivia Thirlby plays the potential sister-in-law and the movie almost lets her do more than smell a rat in Jimmy. The same is true of Cuoco-Sweeting whose sense of comedic sharpness the film just gives up on. More than once this sham world that Jimmy inhabits keeps revealing funny new layers of fraud. The gay wedding planner pivots from one cliche to the invention of another because he surmises the clientele for his line of work demands it. The movie understands the lucrative value of stereotypes so thats all it peddles. Its all the producer Will Packer peddles too usually with Hart. The only moments that dont feel like a sham are the ones in which Hart and Gad are holding each other on the dance floor reclined in beach chairs reminiscing gently as water from a swimming pool shimmers over them or tongue-tied at the mutual intensity of their connection. I at least felt something. Harts best with a skeptical sparring partner -- like Alan Arkin or Regina Hall -- rather than on his own or with someone he can run all over. His comedy needs a speed limit and often a Kleenex. In song or in motion Gad could be a star. He and Hart are persuasively vulnerable together. This movie isnt uncomfortable with that but it interrupts the awwws -- or the ewwws if youre inclined to be that way -- with a lot of crassness. Maybe the hope is that you dont notice that the ""if you liked blank then youll like blank"" algorithm is sputtering as it attains a version of derivative untapped humanity If you liked Pretty Woman youll love when it pretends to be Bridesmaids.

By Peter Rainer Film critic January 16 2015 Save for later Saved Tang Wei as Chen Lien and Chris Hemsworth as Nicholas Hathaway star in Legendarys film Blackhat from director and producer Michael Mann. Frank Connor/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The timing of the Michael Mann cyber-thriller ""Blackhat"" could not be more fortuitous but the film itself seems ripped less from the headlines than from the perfervid imagination of Mann in full ""Miami Vice"" mode.Chris Hemsworth plays Nicholas Hathaway a cyber genius whose prison sentence for hacking violations is commuted so he can track down the perpetrator of a malware attack on a Chinese nuclear reactor - for starters. Nicholass Massachusetts Institute of Technology roommate Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang) now a Chinese military official is his cohort; his sister Lien Chen (Wei Tang) is the decorative systems engineer who of course falls for Nicholas as they scamper through Hong Kong Indonesia and Malaysia tracking the bad guys.Despite the plethora of car chases and shootouts shot in torrid colorations my favorite part of the movie was its opening sequence an expertly diagrammed five-minute animated rendering of code speeding through a network. Weve come a long way since ""Tron."" Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The human interactions are somewhat less exciting. I dont begrudge Mann and his screenwriter Morgan Davis Foehl for their overemphasis on standard-issue shootouts - its never been easy dramatizing cyber intrigue. Still given our brave new cyber world someone in Hollywood is going to have to come up with a better way to do it. Watching actors tap out code as big buzzing screens of digital data flash on the screen just doesnt cut it. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Do cyber whizzes look like Chris Hemsworth best known for playing Thor? Im sure some do although I doubt there are many who also appear to qualify as decathletes. Thats fine. Even though the filmmakers try to make us believe were witnessing a real-world dystopia this is a Hollywood movie after all. Grade C+ (Rated R for violence and some language.)

(The real-life Sony debacle was more entertaining and even dramatic because it was all about people. Here its all about more mundane things. Much more mundane.) Chris Hemsworth (Thor) plays the handsome hunk who must be retrieved from prison in order to track down the criminals who are (mis)using the very code he wrote while just a mischievous collegian. In consideration of the international box office his co-writer was a Chinese man (with a hot sister) whos now working the case for his nations government. Cue up the exotic locales and violent gun battles because nobody wants to watch a bad guy sitting in front of a laptop in his underwear. Director Michael Mann still knows how to take a pretty picture especially gently moving longshots. And golly if he doesnt do his darnedest to make hacking visually interesting zooming in on microchips to show malware working as mobilized squares of light. But his closeup work on the characters themselves is shaky perhaps in the hope that we wont notice theyre made of cardboard. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Photo Credit Legendary Pictures and Universal / Frank Connor advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A hacker is sprung from prison to help catch one of his kind. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE Another silly cyber-thriller almost saved by an intense Hemsworth and some bruising action. CAST Chris Hemsworth Tang Wei Viola Davis Wang Leehom LENGTH 204 The recent computer attacks on Sony Pictures and the U.S. Central Command might make Michael Manns cyber-thriller ""Blackhat"" seem timely even prescient. Its premise What if a master hacker set his sights on something bigger than a film studio or a military Twitter account? Something like say a nuclear power plant? Dont expect ""Blackhat"" to consider the larger social or political implications of that scenario. Its a thriller with nothing more on its mind than staging a few action sequences and sex scenes in exotic locations around the globe. That isnt necessarily a bad thing. In fact its exactly what Mann (""Thief"" ""Manhunter"" ""Heat"") does better than most. With ""Blackhat"" Mann plays to all his cinematic strengths -- moody lighting bruising violence -- but in the service of a trite story with anemic characters. advertisement | advertise on newsday Mann has always been a mans man fond of macho actors like James Caan and Robert De Niro. Hes found another in Chris Hemsworth of the ""Thor"" films who plays Nick Hathaway a brilliant hacker stewing in prison. Hemsworth a bright spot in this otherwise dim movie plays Hathaway with such thuggish rage that you forget hes supposed to have attended MIT. (You might call him an unredeemed version of Matt Damons Will Hunting). Hathaways old classmate Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom) now a high-ranking Chinese official manages to spring Hathaway and enlist his help in capturing an evil hacker -- a so-called blackhat. From there the script (by Morgan Davis Foehl) delves even deeper into cliches. Chens sister Lien (Tang Wei) falls instantly for Hathaway causing some tension. Clues to the blackhat lead from Los Angeles to Malaysia to Indonesia. Viola Davis plays a likable hard-nose from the FBI; John Ortiz is her bureaucratic boss. Every now and then ""Blackhat"" delivers. The action has a jolting almost breathtaking physicality; Mann still knows how to bring the pain. But the dialogue is flat and the characters even flatter. The story hinges on a nefarious plot straight out of a James Bond movie but the ending feels small-scale and anticlimactic. Despite its fortuitous timing with current headlines ""Blackhat"" is more trivial than topical. 242 MoviesBlackhat trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

His new cybercrime pictureA BlackhatA boasts all his signature themes and curlicues brooding nightscapes heavy synthesizer washes that give way to swift and startling violence a hero whos an odds-on favorite in the Gods Loneliest Man contest. The formula can be intoxicating even in a slack piece of storytelling like Blackhat which is good enough to make you wish it were better. I found myself urging it forward trimming scenes in my head and recasting the lead with ... almost anyone. Hes Chris Hemsworth whos far more credible as an extraterrestrial Norse god fallen to Earth from another dimension than a maverick computer genius serving a long sentence for cyberfraud. The movies feel is part Manhunter part Miami Vice but Mann got a lot more gravitas out of William Petersen Don Johnson and Colin Farrell all of whom could look like they really really wanted to be alone with their loneliness. (Dont bother me Im brooding.) Hemsworth is a blank canvas; you cant feel his soul all a-roil. When his Hathaway -- sprung from prison after an unknown ""blackhat"" sabotages both a Chinese nuclear plant and the world soybean market -- stops to stare into the shimmering heat waves at the end of an airport runway its as if Mann is parodying himself.A  What will Hathaway do next -- fall for some sleek Asian woman?Why yes. Lien (Wei Tang) is the sister of his old college chum and fellow computer freak Dawai (Leehom Wang) who first argued the case for furloughing Hathaway. The FBI doesnt like that and the NSA likes it less (partner with the Chinese government and a renowned outlaw hacker?) but it takes a thief etc. Viola Davis plays the agent assigned to glower at Hathaway and threaten Dawai (""Ill be happy to bust him back to Leavenworth and put your ass back on the first plane to China"") though you know shell come around when she sees that Hathaway can not only break into seemingly impregnable systems but also beat up bad guys like Jack Reacher (the giant in the Lee Child book series not the diminutive Tom Cruise of the movie). As for Lien it isnt long before Hathaway is contemplating her long neck and silken arm as theyre kissed by the sunset then making hungry love to her while bathed in cobalt blue. Mann does some fancy whooshing around in a computers innards in the first scene which Id have been able to watch if a woman in my row hadnt gotten up stepped on my feet come back and stepped on my feet and gotten up again and stepped on my feet. (Me Pick a goddamn seat Her Whats your problem? Its just the beginning.) Theres a lot of jumping around before the narrative gets going; the stop-and-start is constant the plot too lurching to build much momentum or suspense. But just when youre feeling especially languid therell be a brutal fight or shoot-out and youll remember how potent Manns mix of the narcotizing and the ferocious can be. The action scenes have a shot-on-video look Mann plays up. Im of two mindsA  about its effectiveness but at its best its as if hes switching to a different more ""real"" mode of existence. The violence here isnt on the near-hallucinatory level of Miami Vice but its intense emotional ugly in all the right ways.We know little about the villain except -- thanks to an early shot of his back -- that hes shaggy and stout and has reddish-blond hair. I spent a couple of hours hoping the big reveal would be Philip Seymour Hoffman in a secret last role but alas ... The climax in Jakarta has a couple of excellent hemorrhages although too many innocent anonymous Jakartans get casually mowed down for my taste. (I had the same problem with the shambolic Koreatown disco shoot-out in Collateral.) Before that Hemsworth gets to do a big Eureka number out of Manhunter ""Thats what youre doin isnt it you sonovabitch?"" Its a pale listless echo but its rousing in this context.The problem I think is that Mann hasnt reconfigured himself for his new milieu. The Neuromancer-like world of cyberspace would seem to be a natural home for Gods Loneliest Man circa 2015 but in Blackhat Hathaway does more kickboxing than hacking. Mann would rather be coasting the canals or stewing over crime scenes. The definiteness of computers seems to stymie him. For all his digital resources his existentialism is analog.

If that sounds like a good idea to you -- and there have been times when it has to plenty of jaded 007 fans -- then get a ticket. Except that while the movies pretty smart for a big-studio spy movie it seems a little dumb for a Michael Mann movie. Thats the stylish auteur in charge here and compared to his previous genre accomplishments -- not just the uber-80s ""Miami Vice"" but the almost existential ""Thief"" and ""Heat"" -- ""Blackhat"" occasionally feels like a bit of a letdown. Its got some great shots a few strong sequences -- but theres no weight to it. Its about cybercrimes but emotionally it seems to exist in its own empty imaginary space as well. The movie begins with an attack on a Chinese nuclear reactor -- engineered not by teams of terrorists but by malware thats caused the pumps to break down. When a manipulation of the Chicago futures market follows its clear theres a cybercriminal at work -- but who or why is its own bit of code. The U.S. and Chinese governments are already working together but it takes a thief to catch a thief -- so they arrange to spring Americas greatest hacker (who just happens to be not some pallid beardo weirdo but hunky Chris Hemsworth. Ah the movies.) This is a first produced script by Morgan Davis Foehl (whose previous credits were editing Adam Sandler movies of all things) and the nicest thing you can say about him is that his fondness for cliche is unashamed. The plot elements are all time-tested -- the pardoned criminal the careful assembling of the team the cranky by-the-book superiors -- and there are few surprises. Of course surprises were the one thing you used to be able to expect in a Mann film. The relationship between the hitman and the cabbie in ""Collateral."" Or the wonderful left turns ""Heat"" took as its fiercely vulnerable female characters grabbed the spotlight. Theres nothing like that here. Instead theres mostly straight-ahead action -- as our team hops from the States to Hong Kong to Macau to Malaysia their hacking and codebreaking interrupted occasionally by urban shootouts. The dueling laptop stuff isnt terribly involving but Mann still handles real-life violence with skill. There are two city shoot-em-ups which evoke the classic one in ""Heat"" right down to the percussive beat on the soundtrack; a handheld camera throws us right into the middle of a bloody barfight. Mann also has fun with actually ""following"" the code as it makes its assault on computers -- a fanciful kind of ""Fantastic Voyage"" as his camera shrinks to near microscopic size to go chasing down the long ropy veins of wires and poke among the silicon chips. And its a nice touch that rather than a high-tech battle the films climax is patterned after an ugly prison rumble -- with ex-con Hemsworth taping thick magazines to his chest for protection and slipping a sharp shiv up his sleeve for a weapon. But the Asian settings feel more like international marketing strategies than inspiration -- nothing in teeming steaming Hong Kong inspires Mann the way the nightscapes of Los Angeles used to. And although he has a number of tricks in store -- as in ""Heat"" no character is really secure -- the film still feels safe. ""Blackhat"" is enjoyable for what it is. But its not what it could be. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Blackhat (R( Universal (135 min.) Blackhat Directed by Michael Mann. With Chris Hemsworth.

Any movie that evokes Tron WarGames and a vintage Sylvester Stallone movie in its first five minutes isnt boding well for urgency.

(Dec. 29) AP Video Video Video Why Guardians of the Galaxy was the biggest film of 2014 Russell Braun is taking on the title role in the Canadian Opera Companys Don Giovanni which opens Jan. 24. COC Multimedia 48 things Globe Arts is most excited about to start 2015 Even if it hadnt already been headline-trumped by the Sony hacking scandal or so handily out-suspensed by the extraordinary Edward Snowden documentary Citizenfour Manns new movie would still seem about as thrilling and current as a first-generation Atari game system an exercise in sleek redundancy where words like ""malware"" and are supposed to generate shivers of excruciating anticipation.Written by Morgan Davis Foehl Blackhats script may unfold over several countries - the United States China etc. - and speak in several languages but the idiom it favours most is unspeakably impenetrable techno-gab cramming all of its characters mouths with impossible chunks of expositional gristle. Its like listening to a room full of hypnotized IT geeks speaking in tongues.Not that it doesnt occasionally stoop to more prosaic utterances such as when Hemsworths Hathaway - who otherwise moves through the movie like a statue on a dolly - is compelled by the comely Chinese cybercop (Tang Wei) with whom he strikes an erotic spark as intense as a fabric softener sheet to reveal his code ""I do the time. The time isnt doing me.""Invoking vintage Mann - Thief Heat The Insider - only when it stops for a good old-fashioned shootout in a claustrophobic industrial setting or on a busy urban street Blackhat is otherwise a rather desperate retread of the directors signature stylistic tics harsh light bouncing off metallic surfaces (or close enough Hemsworths chest) twinkling cityscapes viewed from swank balconies action sequences cut to disorienting splinters cameras swooping and lunging like scavenging seagulls and moody exchanges of silent glances between externally pretty but internally conflicted souls.But if the overall ambiance not to mention the focus on an uncompromising professional rebel with a code is unmistakably Michael Manns the most vexing problem with Blackhat is that its all ambiance. The style here seems less like an organic expression of the films deeper themes and concerns than a rather desperate attempt to distract from the utter absence of those depths. Like the fetchingly photogenic Nordically imposing Hemsworth who is about as inconspicuous when he goes underground in places like Jakarta as King Kong was when he took Manhattan the movie is all shell and no fish.Going all the way back to TVs era-defining Miami Vice Mann has struggled to shrug off an undeserved rap as a hollow but polished stylist a rap he impressively dodged as his movies eventually synched up their cool hard and shiny exteriors with underlying currents of psychological and emotional resonance. At his best style became substance an articulation of the inner lives of inarticulate individualists. And they were capable of knocking you out with their high-wire balance of visceral appeal and romantic existential macho think of the hyper-sexualized opening safecracking of Thief the daylight bank heist of Heat or even the night siege of the fort in Last of the Mohicans.In those movies the slickness of surfaces gave way to something far messier vulnerable and human beneath a beating heart perhaps or a soul armoured against a battering world. Blackhat reveals the extent of its internal resources with that opening fighter-pilot dive into the guts of a computer an infinite maze of pure circuitry.

Instead it is a bloody bore. For much of the movies interminable running time -- 133 minutes but it seems like forever -- we get to watch the heroes type on computer keyboards. We get to hear them spout cyber bafflegab. We get to feel their frustration because it is so challenging for these good guys -- the whitehats -- to go after the uber-villain -- the evil blackhat hacker -- when he hides his digital tracks so well. We even get to suffer through extended special effects sequences in which Mann shows the blackhats malware spreading through circuits like Clu on a joyride in Tron. Meanwhile in between the most tedious sequences we get to see hulking star Chris Hemsworth crack heads break arms stab a badass villain in the neck with a screwdriver and shoot up public places where innocent civilians are randomly killed. But even this action stuff is routine and too often edited into choppy bits. This makes it impossible to appreciate Hemsworths Thor-like physicality. For mobile users click this link In a rough-hewn way Blackhat is a modern a digital version of To Catch a Thief. In that Hitchcock classic from 1955 Cary Grant plays a now-retired and reformed jewel thief who finds himself compelled to solve a new robbery to establish his own innocence. In Blackhat Hemsworth plays a convicted thief and master hacker who is serving 13 years for cyber robbery. His former college roommate (Leehom Wang whose screen appeal is mostly wasted) is now a senior police detective in China. Working with the FBI on a super-serious hacking case involving both China and the U.S. Wang gets Hemsworth sprung from jail to help catch the criminal. This puts Hemsworth on a team that also includes Viola Davis (the best actor on-screen) and Holt McCallany (also believable as an FBI operative). For a romantic interest that piques Hemsworths interest Wangs character also has a hot and brainy sister played by Wei Tang. Cue the moody pre and post-coital moments along with Tangs hair-in-eyes thing. Aside from the ridiculous opening scenes featuring one of those malware attacks the early parts of the movie are actually interesting. Manns documentary style and use of handheld cameras gives the visuals an urgency that the plot cannot provide. Plus he does not allow Morgan Davis Foehls screenplay to burden the actors with too much dialogue Explaining too much would make the story even sillier. The movie breaks down when Mann and Foehl insert random action scenes such as Hemsworths brute force mayhem in a Korean restaurant in the States. Presumably that was included to show he could handle himself in Hong Kong Malaysia and Indonesia later in the movie but no one much cares by then. That is because when Manns movie goes to the Far East to satisfy Asian investors backing the production Blackhat has totally fallen apart. The villains turn out to be idiots. Some of the heroes die. The geopolitics are murky and the movie is even more so. The final scene is as abrupt and subtle as a beheading. In the end Michael Manns auspicious career has a big ugly black mark on it.

"High-tech Blackhat remains rooted in old-school filmmaking - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review High-tech Blackhat remains rooted in old-school filmmaking Blackhat Review Universal Pictures Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei in ""Blackhat."" Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei in ""Blackhat."" (Universal Pictures) Kenneth Turan The high-tech Blackhat cyber-thriller uses old-school filmmaking to push all the right buttons It lures us in with the promise of up-to-the-minute villainy but the satisfactions of ""Blackhat"" are surprisingly old school.Directed by the veteran Michael Mann ""Blackhats"" story of computer attacks wreaking all kinds of havoc with established institutions is timely enough to echo the cyber-intrusions that recently did so much damage at Sony. But though Morgan Davis Foehls script happily employs modern terminology like malware proxy servers and RATs (Remote Access Tools for the uninitiated) at its heart this is a traditional crime story with the good guys straining every sinew to keep evildoers from their moment of triumph.Fortunately for moviegoers seeking diversion Mann (a key player in TVs ""Miami Vice"" with a feature directing career going back to 1981s exemplary ""Thief"") is especially good at telling this kind of tale. He would have to be to deal with a ""Blackhat"" weakness which is Chris Hemsworth in the starring role. Before we get to Hemsworths character a convicted hacker serving hard time named Nicholas Hathaway we get to see in a way that takes full advantage of Manns gifts as a visual stylist ""Blackhats"" villain doing his worst. Blackhat AP Chris Hemsworth plays a convicted hacker serving hard time named Nicholas Hathaway in ""Blackhat."" Hes pictured here with Viola Davis. Chris Hemsworth plays a convicted hacker serving hard time named Nicholas Hathaway in ""Blackhat."" Hes pictured here with Viola Davis. (AP) This shadowy figure glimpsed briefly taps furiously at his keyboard (""Press enter and let slip the dogs of war"" could have been the films tagline) and courtesy of a marvelous visualization we get to go deep inside a computing system as a virus does its worst.That worst in this particular case is destroying the cooling system at a nuclear power plant in Hong Kong leading to eight dead 27 wounded and a bad international case of jitters.Then a few days later a second shoe drops. To much flashing of lights and electronic numbers a major American trade exchange is hacked with resulting wild spikes in the price of soy futures that could have made someone in the know a whole lot of money. Blackhat movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Blackhat starring Chris Hemsworth Viola Davis and Nick E. Tarabay. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Blackhat starring Chris Hemsworth Viola Davis and Nick E. Tarabay. Video by Jason H. Neubert. See more videos Similarities in both attacks mandate that the United States and China cooperate in tracking down the perpetrator but mutual mistrust means as FBI special agent Carol Barrett (the always reliable Viola Davis) knows this isnt going to be an easy collaboration.China for its part sends over Peoples Liberation Army Capt. Chen Dawai (Chinese heartthrob Wang Leehom) a rising star in Chinese cybersecurity whose impeccable English comes courtesy of time spent at MIT. He brings along his computer whiz sister Chen Lien (""Lust Cautions"" Tang Wei) largely because an attractive computer whiz is always welcome in a movie like this.When Capt. Chen gets to Washington his first request stuns the security bureaucrats. He wants to work with Hathaway his old MIT roommate now a notorious hacker whom weve already seen making things difficult for officials at the prison where hes four years into a 15-year sentence.In theory selecting the brawny Hemsworth best known for his portrayal of Thor in a long string of Marvel movies as someone who can hurt you with his keyboard as well as his knuckles is an intriguing piece of counterintuitive casting. In practice however it doesnt work as planned.While Hemsworth was excellent in the non-Thor role of racing driver James Hunt in ""Rush"" making Hawthorne convincing eludes him. Oddly reminiscent of Marlon Brandos anti-social glowering in ""The Wild One"" the sullen cast he gives to the role testifies to his lack of comfort as much as anything else.Sullen or not its no surprise that Hawthorne gets a conditional get-out-of-jail card to join his old roomie in pursuing the bad guys. And though it seems to take the participants by surprise audiences will not be shocked to discover a growing romantic attraction between Hawthorne and the captains sister culminating in an affair whose chasteness wont hurt its reception in the Asian marketplace.Given the standard nature of sections of ""Blackhats"" plot Manns skill as a director is essential in holding our attention as the Chinese-American team follows multiple lines of electronic breadcrumbs in pursuit of the malicious hacker.Always a crisp propulsive storyteller with a gift for striking images Mann and his cast and crew traveled 10000 miles to 74 locations in places like Hong Kong a remote part of Malaysia and bustling Jakarta Indonesia to bring ""Blackhat"" to life. Technology may have changed cyber-crime may be all the rage but the narrative song remains the same in films like this and its a tune this director knows by heart.------------BlackhatMPAA rating R for violence and some languageRunning time 2 hours 13 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Crime Cyber Crime China Chris Hemsworth Michael Mann obsessive but dont call him a stylist Michael Mann film finds China U.S. on same side of cyber battle Israeli soldiers battle boredom in satiric Zero Motivation Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-blackhat-review-20150116-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,blackhat13,blackhat,latimes
"Blackhat | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blackhat ) Blackhat (United States 2015) January 15 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Blackhat (a slang term used to designate a hacker) represents Michael Manns attempt to put a new spin on an old genre by adding ""cyber"" to ""crime thriller."" Blackhat uses the foggy world of hackers and cybercrime much as he might use background music as a way to enhance a story not to anchor it. For the most part Blackhat takes place in the real world with real world thriller elements like shootouts fights and explosions comprising the lions share of what transpires on screen. The motion picture industry is still looking for its first great ""cyber-thriller."" Blackhat isnt it although the film earns marks when it comes to verisimilitude (at least for its first two-thirds) an admittedly daunting hurdle. The narrative touches on how the manipulation of code and the launch of malware can have devastating real-world consequences. However Manns animated attempts to give the movie an unconventional look when it delves into the land of 1s and 0s look like outtakes from TRON. The problem with making a movie about cybercriminals is that their methods are inherently non-cinematic. Maybe theres a visionary director who can ramp up the tension focused on a person sitting in front of a computer for days or weeks but it hasnt happened yet; even Lisbeth Salander was more interesting when she was out and about. From a box office standpoint Blackhat is on fragile ground in large part because its not a playground for big-name stars. Apart from ""Sexiest Man Alive"" Chris Hemsworth who plays the lead and Viola Davis no one in Blackhat is going to be familiar to the average American movie-goer. Wei Tang and Leehom Wang do solid jobs but who outside China has heard of them? And although Hemsworth is best known as Thor its questionable how far beyond the Marvel Universe his appeal ranges. Blackhat utilizes the abilities he showed in Ron Howards Rush but while that may help Hemsworths acting credibility it likely wont do much to fill theaters. Blackhat concerns jailed hacker Nicholas Hathaway (Hemsworth) who is given a chance at freedom if he works as a consultant to collaborating U.S. and Chinese authorities investigating the activities of a global cybercriminal who has already caused a nuclear disaster and a stock market roller coaster ride. Working alongside his skeptical handler Carol Barrett (Davis); his ex-college buddy Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang); and Chens brainy sister Lien Chen (Wei Tang) Hathaway uses his training mind and brawn to follow the hackers trail across Asia. Despite being overlong Blackhat is mostly engaging. The narrative features one major change of direction and things get increasingly preposterous as the climax approaches but thats not unusual in this genre. Like a lot of Mann productions theres a stylistic emphasis to how things are presented with a mix of hand-held sequences overhead shots beautifully framed cityscapes and violence that sometimes borders on artistic. Mann also delights in playing with his viewers. Theres a scene in which we know something is going to blow up. To enhance the moment he toys with shot selection and drags things out. The film also does a good job on an emotional level by investing the audience in the romance between Hathaway and Lien Chen which is suitably tender and not overplayed. Blackhat follows the James Bond formula. It takes viewers on a global tour that includes stops in the United States Hong Kong Jakarta and Malaysia. The villain is the typical 007 megalomaniac-type whos ultimately a little disappointing when we see him up close. He has a henchman. Theres an ""M""-type (thats Viola Davis role) and a girl/love interest. Its a little ironic that for a movie that seeks to dramatize crimes cutting edge Mann has reached back to one of the most venerable action-thriller templates. In the end Blackhats biggest drawback may be that its an adult movie released into a marketplace that is increasingly hostile toward films of this sort - productions that require a degree of patience and a willingness to pay more attention to the theater screen than the cellphone that is supposed to be turned off. Blackhat is far from Manns best work (for me that remains his 1992 version of The Last of the Mohicans although Heat has its share of supporters) but its a serviceable thriller that deserves better than to be dumped into an ignominious January grave.

Then again they never said they had anything against abject boredom.A seemingly timely cyberterrorism manhunt thriller directed by Michael Mann Blackhat must have sounded enticing on paper Hollywood heartthrob (Chris Hemsworth) teams up with a gravitas actress (Viola Davis) and a fetching international co-star (Tang Wei) to bring down a nefarious hacker. Throw in Mann a master of macho action sheen (Heat The Insider Collateral) and youve got potential for a rare January gem.Or not. Blackhat is Mann at his most maddening and obtuse desperately trying to lift a tangled screenplay (by Morgan Davis Foehl) beyond its limits with an excess of gaudy style. It plods and scrambles through a maze of plot points that pile up when they should be jelling. The movie feels long. More alarming for a Mann production it also grows increasingly incoherent visually and otherwise.Hemsworth stars as Nicholas Hathaway Americas hunkiest hacker doing time in a maximum-security prison for stealing millions from banks. Striving for maximum cool a must for a Mann hero Hemsworth glowers and tries to ignore the perfect strand of hair dangling impeccably over his forehead.Nicholas former MIT roommate (Leehom Wang) is a Chinese military computer wiz. The roommates sister (Tang Wei) also knows her way through the coding jungle and she gets off one of the movies very few funny lines when her brother scares off a barroom suitor. ""That cost me a second martini"" she hisses. Family. Always getting in the way.That barbed sense of humor is nowhere else to be found in Blackhat a joyless journey that goes round and round until it decides to end. Even at his best Mann walks a line between archetype and stereotype. His heroes behave with controlled but operatic grandeur. With the right project and enough conviction his characters can seem larger than life. In Blackhat they usually feel ridiculous and even a little tired.One exception is Davis who classes up the joint as an FBI agent and has fun going toe to toe with Manns men. Her best moment when she coolly threatens a Wall Street banker who wont give up his clients info suggests a movie that might have been.It would be nice to say Blackhat at least offers a dollop of insight into geopolitical relations or Americas security state. But it all just comes off as more background noise and mechanical story movement.Great filmmakers make bad movies and you can usually see what they were trying to do but somehow couldnt (with all the moving parts and personalities involved its a small miracle good films ever get made).Im not sure if Blackhat is a sign of fatigue and boredom for Mann but hes never made a movie that seems so rote. Blackhat feels like something a computer spit out in response to a chunk of coding. It is malfare.BLACKHAT (C-)Directed by Michael Mann. R (violence and some language).133 mins.

Blackhat is an unfortunate non-thriller for the digital age review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBlackhat is an unfortunate non-thriller for the digital age review With his hacker non-thriller Blackhat Michael Mann forgets that the best software of all is people.Tang Wei and Chris Hemsworth star in Blackhat.  (Frank Connor / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 15 2015BlackhatStarring Chris Hemsworth Tang Wei Viola Davis Wang Leehom Ritchie Coster and John Ortiz. Directed by Michael Mann. Opens Friday Jan. 16 at GTA theatres. 127 minutes. 14AMichael Mann has discovered computers like an analog Rip Van Winkle roused from a long slumber to greet the digital age.And its a case of love at first byte or something like that.Article Continued BelowIn Blackhat Manns unfortunate non-thriller about conniving hackers every blinking screen transfixes him and the thought of all those zeros and ones zooming through wires across the Internet has him completely in thrall. He wants to chase each and every one of those magical digits like a virtual cat following a virtual mouse and he and his ShakyCam just about do that. Ever wonder what a keyboard looks like from the inside? Youre about to find out.All of which might be interesting if this were 1995 instead of 2015 and there were a modem squealing instead of the beeping sounds Mann lards into his cacophonous soundtrack. Or dial it back even further to WarGames in 1983 when Matthew Brodericks good-guy hacker accidentally unleashed global mayhem by illicitly tapping into a top-secret computer system.This is essentially what Chris Hemsworths good-guy hacker Hathaway does in Blackhat although in reverse and with far less entertainment value. Someone has grabbed the RAT (Remote Access Trojan) malware that he and his college roommate Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom) dreamed up for kicks while at MIT. He (or she) is using it to do despicable things by remote control such as blowing up the Chinese nuclear reactor we see at the start of the picture in one of the films few good action sequences.Hathaway cant really be blamed because hes currently doing time for other computer mischief which really wasnt his fault either. Theres no option left but to spring the big guy from the slammer so he can chase across Asia after the blackhat or blackhats doing the devils digital work with his after-school project. Viola Davis gamely plays the FBI agent tasked with keeping up with him while Chen Lien (Tang Wei) the computer savvy sister of Chen Dawai is interested in Hathaway for more than just his mainframe if you catch my drift. This latter development also gives Hemsworth taking a break from swinging his hammer as Thor a chance to remove his shirt at every opportunity.The real problem here is that the film scripted by former Adam Sandler editor Morgan Davis Foehl doesnt really go much of anywhere. Some of the so-called intrigue seems downright goofy -- one character wants to corner the market on tin of all things maybe because theres too much competition for gold and diamonds. Way too much time is devoted to Manns love affair with technology which in fairness isnt entirely a new thing for him. He was an early adopter with digital cinema putting it to good use in films like Collateral and Miami Vice where he exploited the ability of digital cameras to see better in the dark than conventional cameras and celluloid.Mann also used to have a much better feel for action in movies like Heat Collateral and Manhunter than he exhibits here.There are still flashes of the filmmaker of yore as seen in a shootout in the midst of a group of marchers carrying flaming torches.There are just not enough of them while at the same time there are too many boring machines. The film is loaded with characters but few are interesting. With Blackhat Mann forgets that the best software of all is people.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsDundas St. W.s Fugo Desserts serves up a smores coneIf you cant make it to a campfire this summer this treats for youNewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Even one that appears to come from my boss. (Maybe especially one that appears to come from my boss.) And yet this is exactly what happens at a critical moment in ""Blackhat"" when a high-ranking National Security Agency official falls for this entry-level spoofing attack inadvertently handing a hacker the keys to the NSAs legendary ""Black Widow"" supercomputer. The hacker then uses Black Widow to piece together a tangle of corrupted data that will we have been led to believe save the world though from what or from whom is unclear. ""Now we wait"" whispers the hunky Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth playing the nerd love child of Jason Bourne and Sherlock Holmes) as an explosion of pretty colors fans across his computer screen. Oh dear God. Im not sure what the biggest problem is in this unthrilling thriller about an imprisoned cyber-criminal who is let out of jail in order to track down the mastermind behind a pair of computer attacks -- one on a Chinese nuclear power plant and the other on Chicagos soybean futures market. 1 of 99 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x What not to watch View Photos A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics.

Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last.

Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Maybe its the lame dialogue ""When this is over what will you do?"" asks Hathaways love interest Lien (Wei Tang) in just one of many cliches reheated by first-time screenwriter Morgan Davis Foehl whose script is a smorgasbord of romance and action-movie leftovers smothered under a gravy of incomprehensible techno-speak. It could simply be the films pervasive preposterousness. In addition to that ridiculous NSA scene director Michael Mann stages the overlong films climactic showdown in the middle of a crowd of thousands none of whom betrays any reaction to the presence of a crazed gunman (Ritchie Coster) until he actually starts shooting. Maybe the open-carry laws are different in Jakarta. At least I think it was Jakarta. Between the United States China Malaysia and other far-flung locales the film logs some serious frequent-flyer miles. ""Blackhat"" is also one of the most visually unattractive movies Ive ever seen. Seemingly shot on a shaky smartphone Manns blurry jerkily edited digital video is hard to read especially during action sequences. Im not sure what exactly happened during a chaotic fight in a Chinese restaurant between Hathaway and some goons working for the films Dr. Evil except that Hathaway and Lien somehow manage to walk away from it. Beyond his mad computer skills Hathaway is very good at throwing things Fists tables -- even a van at one point -- go flying through the air here. Whats more the film is painfully loud between a barrage of overamplified sound effects and a booming if unmemorable score (one of whose three composers has since disavowed his work on the film). Theres actually a scene where Hathaway and Lien cant hear each other and have to move to another location just to be understood. Speaking of comprehension the film is riddled with logic holes having to do with say the dramatically convenient timing of a car bomb -- it kills a supporting actor but spares the stars -- and the fact that Hathaway despite wearing an ankle bracelet seems to have been given an absurdly long leash by his FBI handler (Viola Davis). Shes the absolute the best thing about ""Blackhat."" Other than a couple of brief CGI sequences in which Mann succeeds in visualizing our dependence on computer technology by zooming in on the vaguely ""Tron""-like microcircuits and electrical connections that increasingly control our contemporary wired society Davis is the films only pleasure. Based on her performance alone Id be willing to give ""Blackhat"" a single pity star. But because shes in the film so briefly Im going to have to take back half. 1/2 star R. At area theaters.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 637pm on Thursday Jan. 15 2015 Thursday Jan. 15 2015 Friday Jan. 16 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram January has a reputation as the tar pit of movie months where bad films go to sink and die leaving barely a ripple.Exhibit A Blackhat a dim-witted dullard of a thriller about hacking and terrorism for profit that has one saving grace timeliness. But of course thats the one thing that was beyond the filmmakers control. Being current only gets you so far when the script is techno-babble nonsense and the acting is as wooden as the Sequoia National Forest.The title refers to the term used by the cyber-sophisticated cool kids for a person who uses their hacking powers for evil. Enter Nicholas Hathaway (a woefully miscast Chris Hemsworth whom you know better as Thor) who was one of these guys and received a long prison term for it -- though he insists he was ripping off banks not the average bank customer.Now in the wake of a hack attack on a Chinese nuclear plant and the manipulation of the New York Stock Exchange the American government needs someone of Nicholas talents to help track down the global baddie behind it all. It just so happens that his old college buddy Chen (Leehom Wang) is investigating from the Chinese side and convinces the U.S. authorities -- primarily agent Carol Barrett (Viola Davis in a ""what am I doing here?"" performance) -- to let him team with his friend. Now that Nick is wearing his metaphorical white hat -- as well as his indestructible government-issued ankle bracelet -- everything will be just A-OK right?It also just so happens that Chens sister Lien (a stiff Wei Tang Lust Caution) is conveniently along for this thrill ride so that Nick can have a love interest. Almost immediately she emotionally hacks into Nicks heart -- even though theres absolutely no chemistry between them whatsoever -- resulting in one of the most clumsily staged love scenes in recent memory. Not helping matters is Hemsworth a stone carving of an actor who makes for a decent Thor but is far less convincing as a flesh-and-blood human. Dude you need your hammer -- and your Valhalla bro Loki -- back like yesterday.Now if the good guys are so wan and weak surely the bad guys bring some punch to this party? Unfortunately they are as faceless and forgettable as those who are chasing them.It wouldnt be so bad if the predictability were punctuated by some off-the-charts head-slamming face-punching leg-snapping action. Yeah not so much. One nasty ooh-thats-gotta-hurt broken arm aside its all generic. Blackhat is the first credited script from writer Morgan Davis Foehl and it seems like it. Everything feels warmed-over like this mornings oatmeal. But at an interminable 135 minutes it takes a lot longer to choke down.Not even the hand of director Michael Mann -- who oversaw Heat The Insider Ali Last of the Mohicans and Miami Vice -- can save Blackhat even though there are some typical moody Mann touches. The climax at an Indonesian festival has the potential for arresting visuals and it brings back fond memories of some of his earlier better films. After all the epic shootout in Heat remains one of the best in the business.Yet even that comes up short and its all far too little far too late reminding viewers that if they want ripped-from-the-headlines topicality theyre better off just turning on cable news. It may not be any more informative but at least it might be more entertaining.Still the worst part about Blackhat is not whats in the movie but what it portends. January is only half over.

Photo Frank Connor/Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Blackhat Running time 135 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity sexuality). Now playing. ""Blackhat"" poses some important questions. Cyber-terrorists got your nerves a bit jangled? Worried that the all-powerful Pentagon is powerless against North Korean Internet twerps or that the next time you log onto your Citibank account youll find a skull and crossbones where your life savings used to be? Never fear Thor is on the case. This is a cat-and-mouse game. Chris Hemsworth is the cat with his leonine mane and his low throaty purr. The mouse alas is attached to a computer keyboard and the structure of the film is roughly as follows MIT whiz/felon Hathaway (Hemsworth) is sprung from prison on the promise that his sentence will be commuted if he figures out what cybernerd hacked a Chinese nuclear facility. He gets on a plane and peers at a computer screen. He goes to LA to peer at another computer (and a dead guy nearby) then to a Korean restaurant where he peers at another then to Hong Kong where he peers at another. Somewhere in there is a broody love scene that has all the energy of storm clouds rolling in and a lot of stale dialogue that sounds like ancient cop shows now airing on Cozi TV. ""I did the crime Im doin the time. Time isnt doing me."" This Michael Mann-directed film is full of Michael Mann-isms many of them familiar from and done better in ""Heat."" Theres the loud assault-rifle-filled midshow gunfight (in this case a bit random and somehow boring) and an exciting conclusion that harkens back to the glory days of Pacino and De Niro creeping around the airport at night. The setups to the set pieces are where Manns screenwriter (Morgan Davis Foehl) fails him. Though the film is reasonably engrossing and has a knockout ending not a lot about it makes sense. An NSA honcho falls for one of those ""click here"" emails? You can walk into the worlds most secure hacker using the disguise known as ""a baseball cap""? And if you happened to find yourself behind a group of bad guys shooting at your friends would you simply chuckle softly at your good fortune and shoot the villains in the backs of their heads or drive around in front to give them a sporting chance to fill you with bullets? Photo Frank Connor/Legendary Pictures and Universal PicturesMoreover too much of the film seems to have been dictated by Chinese marketing needs Co-stars Wei Tang as the love interest and Leehom Wang as her brother and Hathaways MIT buddy dont create much spark. Still I kind of love Manns contrarian impulses -- where other action directors cut frantically he slows everything down goes for the long suspenseful take. When Mann men get killed it actually looks painful -- a screwdriver to the cheekbone here is especially ouchy. Mann isnt a great filmmaker but he lards his work with enough pained soul-searching and gravely portentous music that he can reasonably be mistaken for one. Its in the last half-hour that Mann really wrestles the film above mediocrity which makes you rue all the pointlessness and dawdling earlier in the film. (Did we really need to watch five minutes of pulses racing up and down cables to illustrate malware? Why doesnt our hero ask the thugs who attacked him in LA who sent them?) Those last scenes in Indonesia though tense subdued deliberately paced yet incandescently brutal. The payoff scene in which the combatants try to outflank each other during a colorful pageant involving ranks of costumed musicians and dancers is easily the most vivid and muscular in the film and typical of Mann in that the essential silliness (magazines deployed as a bulletproof vest?) is easy enough to overlook. Theres way too much cyber in this movie but at least theres some thriller too.

The fact that the cyber-thrills coursing through Blackhat come on the tail of the recent Sony hacking and reported threats from North Korea is just icing on the data cake. Break down the film and its just good hackers versus the blackhats a Western in digital drag. Put Mann on the case as director producer and co-screenwriter and youre in for high-style high-voltage gamesmanship. Short attention spans need not apply which may explain why the studio has buried the film in the box-office black hole of January.

But you dont see Peoples Sexiest Man Alive until Mann is good and ready. The sensational opening shot about five minutes long follows a RAT. Thats a Remote Access Tool a computer worm similar to the one that attacked an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010. This time the RAT infiltrates a Hong Kong computer network that controls a nuclear reactor. The globe as always is at risk unless the blackhat is blacked out. Wang Leehom plays Capt. Chen Dawai the MIT-trained Chinese military bigwig in charge of bringing down the cyber-terrorist. He cant do it alone of course. Enter Thor er Hemsworth as Hathaway the captains college roomie whose hacking exploits have put him in a federal pen for 15 years. After the Chinese make a deal with the FBI in the formidable person of Viola Davis Hathaway is sprung so the good guys can get on the case before more damage is done. The Chicago Mercantile Trade Exchange has already been hacked and raised bloody hell with soy futures. Whats next Armageddon? Could be. The plot is overloaded and no one (except maybe the fan base desirous of seeing Hemsworth shirtless) needed sexual sparks to erupt between Hathaway and a hottie network engineer (Tang Wei) who happens to be the captains sister. Acting isnt the point here. Mann and ace cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh are eager to keep the action percolating in locations that include the neon blaze of Hong Kong and the exotic sizzle of Jakarta. Best of all is the excitement of watching Mann use his kinetic powers as a filmmaker to tackle the new face of 21st-century warfare. What Blackhat tells us about the best coders - the choices they make to individualize their programs the different ways they extend their abstractions to have an effect on the real world - also applies to the best filmmakers. In Manns iconic crime stories from Manhunter and Thief to Heat Collateral Miami Vice and Public Enemies he uses color design editing music and camera movement to track a flesh-and-blood villain. They still exist. But a gun like the one wielded by Hathaway is no match against an invisible force - a code a worm a virus that can attack and even annihilate without leaving a trace. Talk about timely. The urgent provoking Blackhat is art imitating the perils of cyber-life and Mann is just the groundbreaking artist to do it.

"Blackhat review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Blackhat Blackhat Legendary Pictures Universal Pictures Chris Hemsworth in ""Blackhat."" Chris Hemsworth in ""Blackhat."" (Legendary Pictures Universal Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Chris Hemsworth plays the hunkiest hacker in Hacker Town. ""Blackhat"" is a thickly plotted disappointment yet it has three or four big sequences proving that director Michael Mann who gave us ""Thief"" ""Heat"" ""Collateral"" and others has lost none of his instincts for how to choreograph photograph and edit screen violence.My favorite moment comes in a waterfront chase taking place in Hong Kong -- the movies set variously in Hong Kong Los Angeles Malaysia and Indonesia -- when Manns hand-held digital camera runs perpendicular at high speed into our heroes themselves running. Then the camera makes a quick right turn joining the race against time and the pursuit of the bad men with guns. Its pure cinema and ""Blackhat"" has its share of it. If it had more movement and less story or if it had a story and characters that excited the imagination rather than merely showing up for work wed have a swell globe-trotting thriller. Chris Hemsworth plays Hathaway the hunkiest convicted hacker in the known universe doing hard time stateside at the start of the film. Hes sprung from prison to assist the hunt for a cyberterrorist of shadowy origin.The team includes FBI agent Barrett (Viola Davis); Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom) Hathaways old computer-genius roomie from their MIT days; and Dawais sister Chen Lien played by Tang Wei who is there to fall in love with Hathaway and vice versa. On the other hand in a Mann film the male protagonists are always a little more in love with their own sunglasses. Hathaway and Lien become lovers; the story proceeds around the globe; there are many many shots of people looking at computer screens showing all sorts of numbers and indications that someones about to be hacked or was recently hacked or is about to make an unauthorized Swiss bank withdrawal. The criminal weasel of the title threatens the worlds safety with nuke plant meltdowns stock market chicanery and strategic flooding.Mann does the best he can with the scenes not involving running or shooting. The script by Morgan Davis Foehl keeps the histrionics to a minimum but the intrigue level rarely rises above medium. Its an indication of Manns skill that when a major character dies suddenly in an airport shootout the scene makes time for a few seconds of mourning. Latest movies reviewedOpen link Well see how ""Blackhat"" does overseas; I suspect in the U.S. even among those who write code for a living it may prove a mite dull to be a hit. The extreme high-definition digital video aesthetic cant help but look cheap even in Manns hands.

(AP ... more Photo Frank Connor Associated Press Blackhat review Michael Mann movie bombs 1 / 1 Back to Gallery You ever see a garbage truck unload? It backs up slowly and stops the back door drops and a cascade of wet smelly junk comes rolling and tumbling out. Releasing a movie in January is something like that. Aside from the 2014 releases going wide following Oscar-qualifying runs in Los Angeles what makes it into theaters in January is generally pretty raw merchandise. So the January release of ""Blackhat"" the latest film from a major American director Michael Mann (""Heat"" ""The Last of the Mohicans"") was a real mystery. And it remained a mystery until about 10 or 15 minutes into the film when the mental image returned of that garbage truck backing up very slowly ... ""Blackhat"" is a film about cybercrime that is at first difficult to follow and later perfectly clear and preposterous. A hacker or a team of hackers causes a Chinese nuclear reactor to blow and China and the United States team up to stop them before they can strike again. That means springing from prison the one genius hacker smart enough to beat the hackers at their own game. Hes played by Chris Hemsworth because thats what computer geniuses look like in the movies. Mann suffocates ""Blackhat"" with style. The trouble starts in the opening scene in which he shows how the Remote Access Trojan makes its way from the hackers to the nuclear reactor. He does this by having the camera go below the floor and then zip along miles of cable and of course we have no idea what were looking at and its not particularly interesting. Throughout the camerawork is choppy full of movement and odd cuts all done in a frenzy that cant qualify as vigorous but rather is like showing off. Or maybe its just a failed attempt to add excitement where there is none. Meanwhile even as Mann is practically doing somersaults with the camera the soundtrack is doing nothing but creating distance with a steady synthesized humming and buzzing that makes you feel youre in a waiting room with the worst fluorescent lighting in history. The first half of ""Blackhat"" is numbing -- it takes an act of will to stay awake. Its just a lot of people looking at computer screens and talking about fragments of malware and IP addresses. Nicholas (Hemsworth) strikes up a romance with his friends sister (Tang Wei) and thats very nice though for them not us. If the second half is better its only in the sense that silly is less awful than boring. Consider this Here is a computer genius in whom two governments are investing their hopes. Here is this mind that must be preserved and nurtured lest all civilization spiral into chaos and darkness. Yet even so his FBI minder (Viola Davis) lets him shoot it out in the streets of Hong Kong with the cybercriminals henchmen. Chris Hemsworth is a solid leading man and is in no way to blame for this. Maybe someday hell get to play Bill Gates. And Tang Wei is charming in this English-language role. But ""Blackhat"" is pretty much nonsense which Mann directs with such misplaced energy and with such little natural instinct for the material that for most of the running time the movies problems seem entirely his fault. In a way they are but only in the sense that he chose to direct this script. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 288722381 Chris Hemsworth and Michael Mann misfire in Blackhat REVIEW Casting Chris Hemsworth as a computer hacker is one of the biggest slip-ups in the laughable cyber-espionage thriller ""Blackhat.""  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune January 15 2015 -- 229pm Universal Chris Hemsworth plays a computer hacker in ""Blackhat."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint I can see casting Chris Hemsworth as Thor. After all hes 6 feet 3 and Hollywoods physique trainers have bulked him up to Marvel superhero quality. And he was acceptable as Formula 1 racer James Hunt in ""Rush."" His male model looks explained Hunts legion of lady fans better than scenes of him driving 170 miles per hour. But casting him as a computer hacker? Thats one of the biggest slip-ups in the laughable cyber-espionage thriller ""Blackhat."" I mean just Google computer hackers. They look like nerds who got painful high school wedgies not smoldering owners of the worlds best bone structure whove just finished walking down a Gucci stage. Ten-out-of-10 good looks may make you an appealing movie actor but not a believable one. The film opens with a program-twisting computer network raid on a Chinese nuclear power plant that makes it go full Fukushima. A parallel incursion against the Chicago Board of Trades futures traders siphons off a very large amount of coin (although these days 72 million sounds like the kind of small change Dr. Evil collects). Chinese cyber defense forces and the FBI join forces to capture the anonymous mastermind behind the attacks. If it was a North Korean ticked off about ""The Interview"" the film would progress beyond screenwriter Morgan Foehls malware-infected mix of exposition chatter and exaggerated gunfights. As if. The chiseled Hemsworth stars as Hathaway an MIT graduate turned cybercriminal. Hes doing a lengthy term in federal prison where he receives supermodel-quality haircuts and has time to do very complicated pushups. Hes recruited to break into the bad guys hacking network. Of course he is -- his cheekbones could after all cut diamonds. He joins forces with MIT classmate Chen (Leehom Wang) now a chief of Chinese state security. BLACKHAT  out of 4 stars Rating R for violence some language. Also on the team is Chens comely sister Lien (Wei Tang) another ninja-deft computer hacker. Because they like to talk about Tor relays and Stuxnet attacks and type quickly on clicking QWERTY keyboards Hathaway and Lien fall into a romantic hookup despite no compelling reason for the couple to be together. Director Michael Mann is no doubt trying his best here. After all he has guided top character performances from Daniel Day-Lewis Russell Crowe Tom Cruise Johnny Depp Christian Bale Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Hemsworths best scenes involve hand-to-hand fighting and expert marksmanship not realistic skills for a computer geek. Sure the scenery is breathtaking mostly Kuala Lumpur Hong Kong and Indonesian megalopolises that seem like real-life ""Blade Runner"" cities. Its the human side of the story thats missing in action. Its all right to have a major chase or shootout in a large public gathering but to have the locals ignore the XXL foreigner in a battle royal while they walk past him in the thousands is particularly awful. While Wang and Tang play like theyre in the same movie (they have been before co-starring in Ang Lees ""Lust Caution"") Hemsworth stares blankly at almost every development including his sex scene whose vibe writing and performance simply are not cutting it. For him and even the revered Mann this is a big misfire a career steppingstone in the wrong direction. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

VPCMichael Manns film about an expert hacker (Chris Hemsworth) sprung from prison to solve a cybercrime is downright stupid with a horrible romantic subplot. But it looks pretty cool.Chris Hemsworth stars as an expert hacker recruited by the FBI to solve a deadly cybercrime in ""Blackhat.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Story Highlights2 stars (out of 5)The story could have been compelling but is instead silly.The acting is nothing special but the plot is far worse.""Blackhat"" is a mess of a movie from Michael Mann a would-be cyberthriller slowed by stupidity and sabotaged by a stunningly silly subplot.Its as if Mann and screenwriter Morgan Davis Foehl had the making of a good idea and hit it with an idiot stick. Of course this being Mann the film is visually satisfying relying almost entirely on cinematography (by Stuart Dryburgh) as a substitute for story.The film begins with Mann using a tracking shot to portray malware speeding along the Internet leading to an explosion at a Chinese nuclear power plant. Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang) an officer in the Chinese military a computer expert is called in and must work with the FBI (a similar attack was foiled in the U.S.) to try to solve the case.Upon arrival in America Chen butts heads with agent Carol Barrett (Viola Davis) particularly when he suggests the only way to find out who is behind the hacks -- the commodities market has also been manipulated -- is to spring superhacker Nicholas Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth) from prison where hes doing 13 years for hacking into banks and manipulating millions.Hathaway it turns out was Chens roommate at M.I.T. and the two of them wrote an early version of the code used in the attack as a joke when they were in school. Only Hathaway can stop further mayhem.Often movies about cybercrime rely too heavily on scenes of code scrolling down a screen like a digital downpour. ""Blackhat"" has some of this but rather than getting bogged down too much in the science of it all Hathaway is also conveniently the kind of hacker who spends little time typing on a keyboard instead busying himself with fighting like a martial artist and fashioning homemade body armor out of magazines like a low-rent high-functioning MacGyver.The case takes Hathaway Barrett and Chen all over the world including stops in LA Hong Kong Jakarta Indonesia and Malaysia. Mann makes the most of his locations with sumptuous shots from above below and in between all along the way that capture the eye if nothing else.Chen Lien (Wei Tang) and Nicholas Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth) are on the run in ""Blackhat."" (Photo Universal Pictures)Whats really disappointing is the ridiculously tone-deaf romance tacked on for no apparent reason. Chens sister Lien (Wei Tang) is helping out the team; she and Hathaway fall in love at first sight or something because soon after they meet theyre in bed and every decision for the rest of the film is at least partly predicated on their future as a couple.Plainly put it doesnt work although they do make an absurdly attractive couple which may seem beside the point except that in Manns films -- especially weaker ones like this -- appearance is key.Its tempting to say Hemsworth is miscast more accurate to say that his role was miswritten. Hes a hunky action hero here with little of the brainpower he ostensibly has on display. Wang isnt used that much and Tang suffers worst from a horribly written part.Davis and Holt McCallany (as the long-suffering federal marshal who has to babysit Hathaway) display more genuine emotion in a one-minute throwaway scene than anyone else in the rest of the film.High-profile hacks are no longer solely the stuff of science fiction. Theyre a part of everyday life; ask Sony or anyone hit by the numerous thefts of information from credit cards used at department stores. There is a terrific thriller waiting to be made out of cybercrime but ""Blackhat"" isnt it not by a long shot.Blackhat2 stars (out of 5)Director Michael Mann.Cast Chris Hemsworth Viola Davis Wei Tang.Rating R for violence and some language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(Frank Connor/Legendary Pictures) Tang Wei and Chris Hemsworth in Blackhat (Frank Connor/Legendary Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday January 15 2015 1200 PM Title Blackhat Film Info With Chris Hemsworth Viola Davis. A computer expert hunts a cybercriminal. Director Michael Mann (213). R Violence sexuality. Area theaters. Director Michael Manns best films thrum with a perceived threat that turns out to be all too real. ""Manhunter"" ""The Last of the Mohicans"" ""Heat"" ""The Insider"" and ""Collateral"" all feature characters shaking their mindsets for the sake of a job a greater good or their own survival. Unfortunately Manns newest film ""Blackhat"" fails to connect. The movie about good guys chasing a cybercriminal (or ""blackhat"" as the bad guy would be known to online law enforcement) ought to have more to it. Instead the movies smart ideas are overlaid with dull standard-issue moments of people typing on computers or pursuits through crowded streets. A mysterious computer attack causes a meltdown at a Chinese nuclear reactor. Shortly after the price of soy on the U.S. Stock market is fiddled with. A Department of Justice official (Viola Davis cooly efficient) decides to team with a Chinese cyberexpert Chen (Leehom Wang) whos out to discover the perpetrator. But the feds need Chens onetime MIT roommate Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth). Hes a genius gone bad let out of prison with a promise to commute his sentence if he finds the blackhat. So Hathaway Chen and Chens sister Lien (Tang Wei) fan out to L.A.s Koreatown Hong Kong and Jakarta tracking Android phones and analyzing reams of eyeball-glossing data always a few clicks away from getting their guy. The script from first-timer Morgan Davis Foehl is heavy on the cliches and not just the tech-y kind. Standing in a barren landscape Hathaway deduces his preys intentions then looks out at the void and wonders aloud ""Is that what youre after you sonuvabitch ...?"" This query comes after such overfamiliar trickery as visual effects that follow a keystroke through wires from one computer to another -- and not one but two shots from underneath a keyboard looking up at fingertips tapping out a message. Mann has subverted genres often brilliantly starting with his first feature ""Thief"" (1981). But the big-screen version of his TV hit ""Miami Vice"" and the listless John Dillinger gangster pic ""Public Enemies"" couldnt think their way out of narrative limitations. The same is true here. Hemsworth better known as Thor in ""The Avengers"" adds an unnecessary layer of lunkheadedness to a guy IDd as a coding genius. His cuddly moments with Wei Tang feel thrown in. Davis and Wang are more solid in less showy roles. The film picks up in the final third which includes a chewy reveal of the villain and a tense Hitchcockian chase through a candlelit parade. Theres also a genuinely creepy sense of the porous nature of the worlds infrastructures and transactions. Manns film is a reminder of how theres no safety on the net.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Michael Mann one of the most confident visual stylists to come out of the slick 80s went punk in the mid-2000s getting deep into space-smearing off-kilter digital camerawork and patchy sound mixes. Manns spent most of his career making mass-market art films but around 2006s Miami Vice the art got weird and abstract and rough. Its as though having established himself as an impeccable widescreen craftsman the director had to go in search of new stranger textures. Manns first feature in nearly six years the hacking thriller Blackhat is rough even by the standards of its directors current creative period. Its the kind of intentionally unpolished work that invites thought experiments of the ""if it were directed by anyone else..."" variety even though no one else would--or could--make a movie like Blackhat. The sound design is deliberately erratic rendering a good fifth of the dialogue unintelligible and though shot on the industry-standard Arri Alexa camera the movie has a smudgy bumpy look that brings to mind the early years of digital cinematography when people still called it video. It has a lot of raw energy and raw energy goes a long way in a movie that mostly consists of people typing and pointing at screens. Blackhats plot isnt byzantine but sometimes feels that way because its rooted in intangibles commodity futures personal codes information moving between agencies money moving between banks. It begins with the Earth rotating slowly crisscrossed by channels of data visualized as white lines that resemble the surface of Europa. Each cut reduces the scale from a hemisphere to a continent to a satellite view of a coastline to a power station and a room and then a server until the viewer is plunged into the microscopic inner architecture of a hard drive watching data move. Back-to-back cyber attacks hit a Chinese nuclear power plant and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and though seemingly unrelated they suggest the work of a single hacker. A joint Chinese-American task force is put together headed by Barrett (a no-nonsense Viola Davis) and Chen (Leehom Wang). Theres a complicating factor The remote tool used to execute the attacks is built on the foundation of a program Chen co-wrote as an MIT undergrad. In order to catch the hacker the task force furloughs Chens college roommate Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth) who is serving time in a federal penitentiary. Being the hero of a Michael Mann movie Hathaway is able to negotiate the furlough into a commuted sentence conditional on the arrest of the mystery hacker.From here the movie plunges straight into the directors established fatalistic neon universe of loner professionals doomed romances late-night coffee shops private jets speedboats and blistering urban firefights. Hemsworths performance suggests that hes internalized the Mann canon bringing to mind William Petersen in Manhunter Robert De Niro in Heat and Colin Farrell in Miami Vice at different moments. Its easily one of the pulpiest things Mann has made a chase mystery whose hero is a hacker whos handy with a gun and its paced like the flow of information across the globe. Even the title slang for ""cyber criminal"" has its roots in pulp fiction.Its also a complex and at times challenging portrayal of an effectively intangible conflict where money matters only as ""a scoreboard."" Nobody works a theme like Mann who can invest a shot of a character framed against an ocean or a white wall with real moral weight as though that endless blank space were some kind of mirror for the soul. He takes insider jargon military tech and skyline architecture and arranges them in ways that are poetic producing images and turns of phrase that transcend milieu a speedboat moving through Hong Kong Harbor at night; gunmen huddled behind concrete blocks at the end of a tunnel that resembles a Richard Serra sculpture; the most beautiful shot of a ringing cell phone ever filmed its screen framed like a monolith.Blackhat is by and large a decentered minor work full of things its director does better than anyone else but which hes also done better elsewhere. That however doesnt change the fact that Mann is working in a texture--unfamiliar chaotic so hard-boiled existentialist that it verges on mysticism--thats major on its own.

Chris Hemsworth plays brilliant hacker Nicholas Hathaway in Michael Manns Blackhat.(Photo Frank Connor Universal via AP)Blackhat is a tedious preposterous and incoherent cyberthriller that is anything but thrilling.When will filmmakers realize that watching people clicking away at their computers as their screens fill with incomprehensible code is in no way captivating? Hearing computer whizzes spout techno-babble about IP routing is even less riveting.Director Michael Manns globe-trotting drama is devoid of suspense. The story is dramatically inert with one-note characters giving lackluster performances ( 1/2 stars; rated R; opens Friday nationwide). The script is marked by awkward dialogue murky exposition and illogical narrative.Mann opens the movie with a mind-numbing tracking shot through microchips. (He later puts the camera underneath a keyboard and shoots up but its no more enthralling.) Humans dont enter the scene until about 10 minutes in.The story opens with an accident at a Chinese nuclear reactor apparently caused by hacker terrorists. We learn that the same hackers have created an international stock market spike in the price of soybean futures.USA TODAYBlackhat taps into a timely topic CybercrimeTeaming with the Chinese government U.S. officials decide that Nick Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth) a brilliant hacker whos currently incarcerated for cybercrime is the best person to solve this mess. Hes furloughed his moves traceable by an electronic ankle bracelet. It just so happens that Hathaways old MIT roommate Chen (Chinese music star Leehom Wang) is high up the ranks in the Chinese military. And he just happens to have a sister Lien (Wei Tang) who helps him solve cybercrimes and who just happens to fall madly in love with the hunky and honorable hacker Hathaway.And why not? Hathaway has more superpowers than Thor. Hes a computer nerd a buff Adonis a shrewd negotiator a chivalrous gentleman and an expert fighter. Hes the sort of brawny brainiac that exists only in the most far-fetched movies.For a film that purports to be about something as timely as cyberterrorism Blackhat lacks substance and immediacy. Mann gives it some style but theres none of the gritty intrigue and energy of his Heat or Collateral. His use of hi-def video for some shots only results in jarring amid low-resolution footage. Off-putting close-ups abound but dont make up for the lack of chemistry between Tang and Hemsworth.Tang makes odd shapes with her mouth (a tongue jutting in a cheek for instance) and the camera lingers inexplicably. It also focuses tightly on Hemsworths steely gaze. So charming in Thor Hemsworth spends most of this movie glowering sometimes staring out windows sometimes into space. Hes probably trying to figure out why he signed on for this turgid mess.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Two agencies American and Chinese combine their powers to capture a cyber criminial who is seeking to bring down the international banking network. VPCHe and Tang are meant to have a romance but mostly they lie around on unmade beds not coupling passionately but sleeping or half-sleeping when theyre not out trying to solve cyberespionage. Its hard to remember a movie in which so much time was spent on unmade beds that didnt involve actual sex.The only actor who distinguishes herself is Viola Davis as Carol Barrett a Department of Justice official. She injects some life into the story with her customary humanity and commitment to character. But her character is not central enough to make that energy translate into excitement.A thriller also needs coherence and plausibility but whole swaths of Blackhat make little sense. A climactic showdown at a street festival in Jakarta is the most ludicrous of all. Wouldnt parading locals notice a strapping blond guy walking menacingly among them toting a gun? And wouldnt they run for their lives?Its rare that a movie is so inane and mind-numbing that its nearly intolerable but Blackhat is that movie. 11 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1ILAAd5",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/01/14/blackhat-review/21758457/,200,blackhat29,blackhat,usatoday

A single glowing blip -- a bit of malicious code we soon learn -- has invaded the circuits and is proliferating. The malwares spread through the network recalls the stealthy swoop of black-clad gangsters in Manns last movie the John Dillinger thriller ""Public Enemies"" (2009) as they sinuously crossed the marble floor of a Midwestern bank.In ""Blackhat"" set in the present Mann weaves an especially timely tale of cyber terrorism but his grim fascination with the choreography of violence is still apparent whether it comes via pistols or pixels. ""Blackhat"" (theres plenty of gunplay in this film too) viscerally dramatizes a muscular techno-thriller version of digital life. And moviegoers who longed to press the ESC key to exit earlier less-gripping cyber-thrillers such as ""The Net"" will be pleased that Manns lethally steely film hums with urgency.When the poisonous code triggers the meltdown of a Hong Kong reactor and a simultaneous strike on the commodities market desperate investigators spring the convicted hacker Nicholas Hathaway (played by Chris Hemsworth) from prison to help them. (""Blackhat"" is a term for a criminal hacker; a ""whitehat"" uses the same skills to thwart the criminals.)Advertisement Though forced to wear an ankle monitor Hathaway takes command of an unlikely U.S.-China joint task force headed on the Chinese side by his former MIT roommate Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang). Carol Barrett (Viola Davis) and Henry Pollack (John Ortiz) are are also members of the U.S. team. The group is immersed in a mysterious kind of detective work -- hunting an enemy whose footprints are either invisible or artificial bounced through proxy servers. One telling shot in a film that attempts to take viewers inside the grid is from within a computer up through its translucent keyboard. This film like so many of Manns takes itself so seriously that it would be ripe for parody if it were not so handsomely styled and obsessively detailed. Stern faces with sunglasses are everywhere. One of the screenplays few emotionally tender moments is communicated over headsets on a helicopter. (No one should come to a Mann film for romance.) People die mercilessly in the hunt becoming the flesh-and-blood victims of data-driven warfare.The director has long relished exploring the cutting edge of contemporary life a corporate stranglehold in ""The Insider"" the elite drug trade in Manns big-screen version of ""Miami Vice.""Not surprisingly he was one of the first directors to embrace digital filmmaking particularly for nighttime photography. His use of high-def video with cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh in the sumptuously nocturnal ""Blackhat"" provides an operatic climax that captures a plane leaving Hong Kong at dusk.Mann is also drawn as if by tractor beam to the murky backwaters of global capitalism Hes never seen a shipping yard he didnt want to shoot. Still someone should lure him back to the woods; the lush wilderness in his ""Last of the Mohicans"" has been matched by few other filmmakers-- maybe only Terrence Malick in ""The New World."" Manns films of late have been sleekly beautiful if cold to the touch. They could use a live-wire like Al Pacino (""Heat"") to animate them.Hemsworth a hunk if ever there was one and a talented actor as well (consider ""Rush"") is convincing as the unusually dashing hacker. The side plot with his love interest Chens sister (Tang Wei) is less successful. But in terms of both its global locales and cast few movies have been as riveting in their exploration of the friend/enemy relationship between China and the U.S. By the arrival of the gorgeous nighttime showdown in Jakartas Papua Squares much of films geopolitical relevance has given way to a clumsily scripted action-film cliche. But man is that cliche something to look at.

Apparently though this hacking stuff is serious Stumbling into a timeliness thats not really his bag director Michael Mann wants us to know that we are not safe. Blackhat begins a little tediously with those tired shots that cruise along computer wires and through flashing microchips until we see a nuclear reactors cooling fans go belly-up. The resulting disaster a Chinese Chernobyl deserves its own Bond villain to chortle at the mayhem while stroking a cat. Mann though seems blissfully unaware that hes making his own Skyfall. Instead he reverts to what he does best ladling on a textbooks worth of tech talk and creating the impression of something profoundly grown-up. A ""remote-access tool"" is suspected in the wrongdoing (wouldnt it be gauche to call the hacker a ""rat""?) and were off to an American prison where criminal programmer Nicholas Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth looking more like a casual Seamless user than a guru) languishes in his cell. They need him to unravel some elegant code. And if he has to take off his shirt once in a while to flex those pecs and juice the Marvel fan base so be it. Go ahead and call this silly but thats missing the point. The movie is high-grade kid stuff loaded with frantic keyboard poundings an unlikely love affair (with Lust Cautions Wei Tang) and splattery urban shoot-outs between white people running through Asian markets that bump up against colonialism. Mann doesnt get the unhinged performances he did from Al Pacino in Heat and The Insider but at least hes back on familiar ground after the calamitous misfire of 2009s Public Enemies. Unlike most directors style is hardly a side dish with Michael Mann--its the main entree. No one captures city lights at night or luxury cars slinking down the highway like the creator of Miami Vice and his conversion to digital video continues to yield breathtaking results. Synthesizers twinkle cell phones vibrate and a certain kind of cinema is reborn.

Exhibit A Michael Manns ludicrous high-tech cat-and-mouse thriller Blackhat. Its a rare and confounding misstep from the director of such stylishly macho noirs as Thief Heat and Collateral. For starters Chris Hemsworth is all wrong as the lead. The strapping Aussie may be convincing as many things--a hammer-wielding Norse god a death-defying Formula One driver--but a brainiac MIT coding whiz isnt one of them. (Somewhere Jesse Eisenberg must be punching his Thor action figure.) Nevertheless Hemsworth in a series of rakishly unbuttoned linen shirts plays Nicholas Hathaway an imprisoned hacker whos furloughed to help the feds track down the shadowy cybercrime network behind the explosion of a Chinese nuclear reactor. Was it an act of terrorism or merely a red herring to cover up a money scheme? Hathaway teams up with Chen (Wang Leehom) an old college pal-turned-Chinese-government agent; an FBI agent (the wasted Viola Davis); and for some reason Chens sister (Tang Wei). Although Blackhat globe-trots from L.A. to Hong Kong and Jakarta the exotic locations are not only all drowned in the same cold blue light Mann popularized 30 years ago on Miami Vice theyre completely squandered. In fact everything about the snoozy procedural feels like a wasted opportunity. The plot isnt twisty enough to be surprising or satisfying the dialogue seems cribbed from an old RadioShack catalog and the performances are lifelessly flat. Occasionally Mann shows flashes of the sort of springloaded action set pieces he was once hailed for like a shoot-out during a religious parade. But mostly they just come off as warmed-over parodies from a onetime master aping his own style.

A hacker plot of spectacular malevolence propels Blackhat Michael Manns alternately heart-pounding and disappointingly dry new thriller. Drilling straight into Digital Age anxieties the filmmaker brings his affinity for outsiders and his cinematic mastery of the cityscape to the globe-hopping story of a convict who becomes a government asset and finally a fugitive. At its best the movie achieves a broody dazzle even as the narrative proves less memorable than one would have hoped. But the fluency of Manns direction and the slow-burn chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei counterbalance the more ordinary and not always involving procedural elements. See more Hollywoods 100 Favorite Films For all its headline-resonant specifics about computer forensics Blackhat -- which takes its name from the term for hackers with destructive intent -- has something of an old-school movie heart Its central couples race against the clock recalls such 60s thrillers as Stanley Donens Arabesque which pitted no less than Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren against devious masterminds using hieroglyphic messages. Here the hieroglyphics are strings of glowing numbers on screens and while Manns vision is far grittier and more muscular than Donens its no less elegant. A tinge of glamour too is an unavoidable side effect when the lead actor has just been christened Peoples Sexiest Man Alive. With far more moving parts than Manns Collateral the movie hasnt the sleek tautness of that drama. But audiences seeking a grown-up alternative to awards-season prestige pictures and those drawn by the chance to see Hemsworth without the fantasy trappings of Thor -- but with a beefcake opportunity or two -- should give the wide release a solid box-office showing. Read more  Chris Hemsworth and Charlie Day Join New Lines Vacation (Exclusive) For his first big-screen directorial effort since 2009s Public Enemies Mann orchestrates a series of bravura set pieces both stateside and in Asia. The story scripted by Morgan Davis Foehl from the directors research opens with a bolt of urgency as two very different disasters strike in quick succession both triggered by malware a nuclear plant explosion in China and a market-toppling run-up in U.S. commodities futures. Despite the reluctance of her boss (John Ortiz) FBI agent Carol Barrett (Viola Davis formidable) liaises with Chinese cyberdefense expert Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom) who insists that the man for the job is his former MIT classmate Nicholas Hathaway (Hemsworth). A coding genius who took a few wrong turns and landed in the penitentiary Hathaway is a taciturn Robin Hood of sorts -- his hacking targeted banks not people hes quick to point out. Hes also quick to parlay the feds offer of furlough for his case-solving efforts into a commutation of his 15-year sentence if he gets the culprit. His chief ally in the project turns out to be Chens ambitious network engineer sister Chen Lien (Tang) -- who given the actresss accented English apparently spent less time in the States than her brother. In many ways though shes more savvy. Not only does Lien know how to smooth over tensions with the flinty Carol but shes sensitive to Hathaways disorientation upon being released from prison. Even when they clash these two understand each other; Hemsworth and Tang (Lust Caution) imbue the characters with a melancholy intensity. Theyre old souls whose emotional connection comes to the fore across a restaurant table in L.A.s Koreatown albeit somewhat tempered by Tangs apparent struggle with the English dialogue. Tellingly their breakthrough moment gives way to a dark intrusion and the scene ends in brutal violence. With no one claiming responsibility for the disasters and Hathaway certain that ""the real hit is still to come"" the pressure is on. The search for the plots architect will take the central characters from Los Angeles to Hong Kong Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur with Stuart Dryburghs dynamic cinematography a fine match for Manns robust visual style. But the essential problem of cyber-thrillers is one that even so gifted a director hasnt quite solved particularly in the films first half Characters looking at computer screens and explaining the significance of what they see doesnt make for the most riveting viewing. Mann augments the talk of encrypted data IP addresses and remote access tools with stylized effects that represent the Internet. The camera swoops through a grid of circuitry that begins to look like an icy vista of abandoned underworld cities giving form to the shadow side of wired-world connectedness. The device recalls the opening of his first theatrical film Thief way back in analog days with its dive into the inner workings of machinery. Read more  Michael Mann on his New Cybercrime Movie Blackhat It isnt until an hour in once the hit-and-miss business of setup is out of the way that the movie hits its charged stride. In subways seaports and city centers the pulse-point cutting (by a quartet of editors) is both precise and unobtrusive whether the scene is a chase or a conversation. The music (by a trio of composers) is variously churning melodic and percussive in every case a mood-heightening match for the visuals. The ultimate scheme turns out to be a geopolitical doozy that requires a liberal suspension of disbelief undercutting the storys potential chill factor. Mann has never shied away from big gestures and if Blackhat is more effective as a visceral ride than a thought-provoking commentary its nonetheless filled with stunning images of dark beauty. The dialogue mostly crisp and sparse can lapse into corny as well and a single line of pointed backstory for Davis character feels tacked-on. But the cast is sharp down the line with Ritchie Costers baddie a menacing standout among the supporting performers. Tang and pop star Wang effortlessly convey their sibling characters privileged background while Hemsworth makes Hathaway a compelling mystery man deploying a sideways glance like a tactical weapon. Much of the movie may feel far-fetched but not Hathaways willingness to cross a certain line -- with none other than the NSA. Its a move that will set him adrift forced to run from governments as well as cybercriminals. In so doing he joins a lineage the men outside the system who populate Manns singular filmography.

In classic Westerns the heroes wore white hats while the villains wore black making it easy to tell them apart. The worlds gone blurry in Michael Manns ""Blackhat"" a surprisingly inelegant yet breathlessly up-to-the-minute thriller -- as well as a newfangled ""Eastern"" strategically set mostly in China Indonesia and Malaysia -- in which the FBI recruits an incarcerated hacker to help thwart an international cyber-terrorist. The weak link in a busy January weekend Universals export-ready offering may not look like much though powered by criminal stunts that make last months Sony breach seem amateur plus action scenes punchy enough to justify the price of admission it could hardly be called hackwork. At his best Manns work explores the thin line that separates good from bad acknowledging the moral complexities of the modern world. Thematically speaking the seemingly ripped-from-the-headlines ""Blackhat"" falls perfectly in line with the ambiguities of ""Collateral"" ""Heat"" and ""Miami Vice"" as the film enlists a dangerous mind to work alongside privacy-violating law-enforcement officials. But it lacks both the chemistry and kinetic energy of those earlier films and whats more it looks just plain awful at times owing to Manns proclivity for down-and-dirty digital lensing. In the 20 years between ""Thief"" and ""Ali"" the visually oriented helmer set a look that other directors have emulated but these days we can feel him struggling to keep up with the times. Aesthetics still matter which is obvious from the opening sequence a purely cinematic attempt to dramatize a cyber-attack starting from the macro and then plunging down to the most microscopic level. The Universal logo yields to a view of the Earth from space featuring the globe aglow with crisscrossing lines of communication; then we zoom in first to China then to the Chai Wan Nuclear Power Plant until the camera passes through a computer terminal to the network of wires motherboards and pulsing white packets of sinister code. This no-system-is-safe mood-setter suggests the modern thriller version of Charles and Ray Eames conceptual ""Powers of Ten"" short culminating in a dramatic plant-core meltdown. But the story goes instantly clumsy from there jumping between characters and across continents without giving audiences their bearings. Imprisoned American protagonist Nicholas Hathaway (Australian actor Chris Hemsworth) gets a moderately interesting introduction We see the ""Thor"" star knocked around his cell and reprimanded for using a cell phone to break into the facilitys meal-credit system. By contrast everyone elses first scenes feel clumsy and forgettable which is too bad considering the impressive multiethnic range of co-stars -- from Chinese agent Chen Dawai (Chinese music star Wang Leehom) to FBI hard-ass Carol Barrett (Viola Davis) -- cast in these supporting parts. What you want from a movie like ""Blackhat"" in which the authorities must rely on someone who could potentially be far more dangerous than the perp at large is a ""Silence of the Lambs""-style battle-of-wits dynamic. But theres never a second in which we believe that Hemsworth is anything but a Boy Scout the worlds hunkiest hacker and an all-around honorable human being -- so much so that the otherwise gritty film pretends that theres nothing odd about giving him a love interest Chen Lien (""Lust Cautions"" Tang Wei) who also happens to be the commanding agents sister. As if to justify Hathaways good-guy status it turns out the reason hes behind bars has nothing to do with his past computer-related hijinks but rather some misguided show of chivalry. While that choice serves to make the character more likable it saps whatever suspense might result from his involvement. A more satisfying screenplay would have given Hathaway some sort of hidden second agenda plotting his escape proving his innocence avenging his captivity. Apart from a trailer-ready scene in which he pretends not to care that another hacker is using his code to stage nuclear meltdowns and rig commodities markets Hathaway appears to possess an even greater sense of justice than the agents hes working for. In other words hes not only the whitest actor in a refreshingly diverse cast but the whitest hat as well. Nothing a dragon tattoo or two wouldnt fix. While the characters motives arent nearly as hazy as the premise promised Mann makes up for that through his choice of technology. Since as far back as ""Ali"" the helmer has been smitten with the look of hi-def video cameras experimenting with the various effects the format makes possible. To eyes that grew up on the rich texture of celluloid -- or are accustomed to the relative sharpness of other digital formats -- theres a certain cheapness to the result. Despite Manns meticulous color-coding of scenes this isnt the look weve come to expect from studio action pictures but rather from backyard horror movies. He still goes big in the staging marshaling sequences that feature helicopters speedboats and exploding cars but the spectacle itself is captured in slippery sometimes low-resolution footage especially apparent during ""Blackhats"" four well-choreographed but otherwise YouTube-quality standoffs. Maybe that was Manns intention. The film is a snarl of contradictions starting with the discrepancy between Manns obsessive demand for realism and the consistently implausible screenplay he developed with first-timer Morgan Davis Foehl (whose prior film credits amount to editing work on Adam Sandler movies). For example Mann insisted that both Hemsworth and the lead villain (Yorick van Wageningen) learn how to code though he hardly ever depicts their characters at computer stations. (Those seeking an edgier treatment of the subject ought to track down the hit German cyberthriller ""Who Am I"" which is due for an American remake.) For a film about hacking its downright absurd how seldom computers appear onscreen. Instead Hathaways preferred strategy in nearly every situation is to handle business ""IRL"" -- offline and in-person -- while a typically Mannian electronic score sets audiences pulses racing. Though its the entire pretext for the film there is virtually no evidence to suggest that the FBI actually needed Hathaways assistance as a hacker but at least he seems a lot more comfortable using weapons than any of the agents hes working for which comes in handy near the end. In time Hathaway manages to uncover his virtual opponents dastardly endgame -- a puzzle he and Lien would more logically have figured out hunched over a terminal several continents away. Instead standing at the would-be ground zero he turns to his sometimes-hysterical Asian counterpart and speaks of the countless ""village people and village dogs"" whose lives are in danger. (Oh dear not the village dogs) Considering these two outsiders can poke around the site uninterrupted its unclear why a terrorist wouldnt just back a fertilizer truck up to his target -- or if a hacker can make 74 million by manipulating the market just one time why hed go through all the trouble of endangering hundreds of lives to achieve the same effect. Still of all the opportunities missed the most obvious is the notion that we are all vulnerable to this brand of cybercrime today. Thats the tension such a film seems primed to exploit but the terrorist strikes depicted feel like variations on schemes hatched by yesterdays Bond villains. Its a disappointment to finally see Hathaways adversary unmasked and though Mann sets up a climactic ""IRL"" showdown between the two amid a huge parade in Jakartas Papua Square the film might have been more unsettling had its villain turned out to be a capricious kid -- or scarier yet had he remained a ghost in the machine a force with no face nor any hat to speak of.

Larry Eckard says November 21 2015 at 921 pm Excellent review by Variety. 2\5 Blackhat was sophomoric predictable and formulaic. It was often verbose using synonyms unnecessarily for emphasis yet seeming flat (eg ""fronts? proxies?"") The film is much more of a suspence/chase/violence movie than it is the high tech hacker film that its dubbed to be. Ultimately it tries to show a vast rift between exteme capitalism as shown by men who kill steel and blow up nuclear power plants for monetary gain and extreme communism as culminated at the scene in Jakarta Papua Square where the good guys chased the bad guys against the tide of ""Red Party"" marchers (in slow motion nonetheless). However it even falls flat on that as a desperate attempt to become a Hollywood blockbuster ends up leaving it in the dust. (Speaking of hokey how does a guy with an ankle monitor just go to China?)

Boy thats A++ film criticism. If thats your game you might want to just make your own movie Debruge. Reply Michelle M says January 14 2015 at 353 am Classy dig at the writer there Mr. Debruge. I suppose any artist worth anything came out of the womb penning Oscar winning screenplays? Reply Jimmy Green says January 13 2015 at 1033 pm ill see it just because mr hemsworth is in it. who wouldnt pay to see that face on the screen for two hrs? Reply V.M. Randall says January 13 2015 at 936 pm meh. sounds like i should just stick to (rewatching past episodes of) person of interest better written most likely better-acted and just as relevant to current events. Reply Matt Toomb says January 13 2015 at 849 pm Heat and The Insider were so good and everything since just so-so... Im not convinced Mann can pull off another groundbreaking action drama. Blackhat looks like Miami Vice all over again... It was good... But not Michael Mann good.

One might also catalog the terrible acting of everyone on screen not named Viola Davis or the eye-scorching cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh (""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"") which follows in the footsteps of director Michael Manns ""Public Enemies"" by making expensive digital camerawork look like a cross between Dogme 95 smudge and footage from an iPhone that fell in a toilet. See Video Chris Hemsworth is a Brainy Beefcake Hacker in First Blackhat Trailer No matter how you slice it this is one hacky hacker saga; one that hasnt cracked the code of how to make a movie about computer espionage that doesnt come down to scene after scene of people sitting at keyboards and making clackety-clack noises with their fingers. Mann to his credit tries to jazz things up with tracking shots through microchips (its like the express lane to Trons house) or even putting the camera inside a thumb-drive slot or under a keyboard thats being typed upon but to little avail. Chris Hemsworth stars as Hathaway the worlds greatest computer hacker who also happens to look like Thor. Currently locked away for cyber-crimes he gets furloughed from jail at the behest of his old MIT roommate Chen (Leehom Wang). Now a higher-up in the Chinese military Chen is working with FBI agent Carol Barrett (Davis) to track down a hacker who put the whammy on both an Asian nuclear reactor and the American commodities exchange using malware created by Hathaway in his college days. See Video Chris Hemsworth Revealed as Peoples Sexiest Man Alive on Jimmy Kimmel Live The pursuit of the villain takes our team -- which includes Chens sister Lien (Wei Tang ""Lust Caution"") who falls in love with Hathaway in one of the most arbitrary chemistry-free screen romances in recent memory -- to Los Angeles Hong Kong Malaysia and Indonesia but all the globe-trotting studio money can buy is no substitute for things like character and suspense and motivation. Hathaway barely exists as a concept and hes one of the films better-written roles; only Davis can make chicken salad out of this material turning vague exposition and clunky dialogue into gold with just one sardonic glance over her sunglasses. Also Read Viola Davis Nearing Multi-Picture Deal to Play Amanda Waller in Suicide Squad Other DC Comics Movies The screenplay demands that we not notice the bad guys inability to hit certain key characters despite constants sprays of automatic weapons fire or the fact that an FBI agent asks another a personal question based on a phone call to which he was not privy or that the blond six-and-a-half-foot Hemsworth is supposed to blend in with the crowds in Asia attracting no second glances as hes on the run in airports or sneaking into computer facilities or engaging in gun battles in the middle of crowded street festivals. Its that climactic procession that underscores the problems with the cinematography which looks its worst whenever theres a light source on screen be it a lamp or a headlight or a window facing the sun. So where does Mann stage his big finale? Amongst hundreds of people carrying torches naturally. Given Sonys recent travails the timing couldnt be better for a movie about the vulnerability of international computer networks but ""Blackhat"" is too much of an embarrassment to cash in its zeitgeist points.

I can tell you pretty much everything that happens in Manns new cyberthriller Blackhat in just one sentence. But I could easily spend 40 sentences -- probably even 100 or more -- telling you how it happens describing the splash of green and red traffic lights reflected in a windshield the purply-brown needle bruise on the tattooed skin of a heroin overdose victim the way the camera seeks out the faintly shadowed ballerina neck curve of Chinese actress Tang Wei. Mann takes the bland elements of the generic mainstream thriller -- the cop being shot the car exploding the hot girl taking notice of the taciturn musclebound hero -- and gooses them into visual overdrive. In Blackhat seeing isnt believing; its merely the process that leads to believing. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Theres visual thinking everywhere you look in Blackhat which is great until you realize that its bled into a kind of overthinking -- the movie is too much of a good thing an exercise that flattens any potential exhilaration or excitement into the sensation of grading a term paper. Its exhilarating at first to move from one aesthetic flourish to another like an excited bee. But before long all those stylistic garnishes start to pile up; you know they mean something but ""knowing"" isnt the same as ""feeling"" and processing them begins to feel like a chore. Ace criminal hacker Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth) is sprung from jail to help old pal and MIT classmate Chen (Wang Leehom) track down the ""blackhat"" or malicious hacker who has brought on a near-meltdown at a nuclear-power facility obviously a prelude to an even bigger cataclysm. FBI agent Carol Barrett (a businesslike Viola Davis) dislikes and distrusts Hathaway from the start glowering at him librarian-style over her glasses and you can see why With his prison-sculpted physique and swoop of slick blond hair hes a sun-kissed galoot a grouchy (if brilliant) slab of faux-Nordic beauty with no allegiance to anyone but himself.She turns out to be wrong of course though it takes awhile for Hathaway to really come into focus as a character. The action in Blackhat skims from Chicago and Los Angeles to Hong Kong and Jakarta with a side trip to rural Malaysia. Along the way Hathaway falls in love (and into bed) with Chens sister Lien played by Tang a network engineer whom Chen has enlisted for the cause Hathaway and Lien find their way to each other almost wordlessly even though Lien speaks excellent if strangely monotone English. Their romance evolves quietly but steadily which makes you believe in it more -- Mann is good at that sort of thing. They exchange knowing glances that render words unnecessary; they sleep curled into each other as if creating a mutual safety net in an unsafe world; they collaborate on a dangerous mission that begins with Lien dressed up in a sleek businessy sheath dress intentionally spilling coffee on a possibly important document and then letting it flap from the window of the hired car shes riding in. Where is she going? Why did she pour coffee on the paper? Why is it important for the paper to dry quickly? The answers are somewhat anticlimactic but that doesnt matter much. One good thing about Mann even in a film that doesnt quite work He enjoys teasing the questions out of you instead of just handing you the answers.Film Details Blackhat RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time133 min. More Info Trailer In fact Blackhat is so engaging in lots of little ways that its a shame the movie doesnt add up to more. Tang and especially Wang -- both of whom appeared in Ang Lees Lust Caution -- may not have as much to do as they should but Mann presents them as possible movie stars of the future sexy and appealing actors worthy of our attention. (How many Asian men especially get to be sexy in American movies? Chow Yun-fat was one of the most sensual actors of the Nineties Hong Kong movie boom but Hollywood never figured out what to do with him.)Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh in his first collaboration with Mann makes a suitable partner in crime Hes good at executing Manns seemingly simple but much-fussed-over visual ideas -- the neon decor of a Hong Kong noodle restaurant glows pink and green just so because you know Mann wouldnt have it any other way. And the movie opens with an imaginative reenactment of computer code snaking through a network presented as a stream of light wending its way along the twists and turns of various circuitry almost as if molten lava had been poured into the crevices of an ant colony. Its a clever bit of visual wizardry that teases in just the right way making you wonder just where youre headed for the next two hours or so.And yet this elaborate purposeful movie never quite connects. Mann has made some extraordinary pictures the Big Tobacco expose drama The Insider among the best of them. But that was in 1999 Since then hes had a string of films -- including Collateral and Public Enemies -- that purport to cut deep but dont amount to much more than bloodless stylistic exercises. Blackhat only makes that list longer. Its acceptably entertaining while youre watching it. But how depressing that Michael Mann should settle for being acceptably anything.Directed by Michael Mann.
