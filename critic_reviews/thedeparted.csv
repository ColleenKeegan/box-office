I want my environment to be a product of me"" Jack Nicholson intones at the beginning of The Departed. ""No one gives it to you. You have to take it."" In theory hes talking about the rise of the Irish in America generally and Boston in particular; in practice hes talking about himself offering up a ""My Way""-like tribute to his own success.And whether or not anyone intended to give it to him Nicholson does indeed take The Departed. A remake of the sleek superb 2002 Hong Kong police thriller Infernal Affairs the movie has been Nicholsonized across the board becoming fatter coarser and more self-indulgent than the original. The credit is not Jacks exclusively but is shared by Martin Scorsese--who for his troubles is a favorite to take home his first Best Director award at the Oscars this coming weekend. If he does in fact win itll be a tad ridiculous. Because not only is The Departed not among the best of Scorseses films; its not even the best version of this film. Infernal Affairs (which I reviewed here) and The Departed both tell a tale of twinned pretenders an undercover policeman who has infiltrated the mob (Tony Leung in the former; Leonardo DiCaprio in the latter) and a mobster working as a mole within the police department (Andy Lau and Matt Damon respectively). Each of them answers to an apparent boss and a secret one and these bosses are the same two men (though with roles reversed) a likable police chief (Anthony Wong Martin Sheen) and a villainous kingpin (Eric Tsang Nicholson). The symmetry of the plot is contrived but cunning and both films have the good sense to play it straight without a lot of windy philosophizing about the neatly balanced deceptions or the nature of identity.Where the films will diverge is made clear in the opening minutes. Infernal Affairs introduces its protagonists with a brisk montage that conveys how each established himself undercover. The Departed follows a similar but twistier path pausing to offer such delicacies as a scene in which Nicholson lecherously asks a teenage girl whether shes gotten her period (and then inaudibly whispers something that is presumably worse) some banter about blowjobs a vicious but comic execution an explanation of the massive tissue damage caused by hollow-point slugs and a police-fire department rugby match that serves primarily as an excuse for the opponents to call one another ""homos."" Now Im not averse to sex or brutality in cinema and I have a considerable soft spot for well-deployed profanity. But it is rather disappointing that even though The Departed is nearly an hour longer than Infernal Affairs violence and vulgarity form the bulk of what Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have added. According to the Internet Movie Database the word ""fuck"" and its derivatives are spoken 237 times in the movie or about once every 38 seconds for two and a half hours.The early suggestion that this will be a story about the rise and fall of the Irish mob in Boston--a Celtic Goodfellas--is an unfulfilled promise There are a couple of references to rivalries with the (Italian) mob in Providence and the revelation that Nicholsons criminal overlord is also an FBI informant (shades of Whitey Bulger) but neither theme is explored. Indeed the films setting seems largely an excuse to give DiCaprio that bane of narrative economy a ""backstory."" (Raised by a working-class Southie dad and a relatively upscale mom; accustomed to living in two worlds; yadda yadda yadda.)Scorseses other additions are similarly questionable. In addition to Sheens fatherly police captain hes added two more top cops (Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg) apparently to increase the opportunity for intradepartmental fisticuffs and name-calling. (I will grant this Wahlberg has a knack for obscene invective perhaps unequalled in film today; certainly no one else has ever ridden so many ""fucking faggot""s to an Oscar nomination.) Scorseses most dubious departure from Infernal Affairs is to compress two girlfriends (one for each protagonist) into one shared between the two moles a police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) who lives with Damon but sleeps with her patient DiCaprio. Farmiga is a promising newcomer in a film full of A-listers but her character is frankly ridiculous. (Her precoital admission to DiCaprio--""I have to say your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now""--is surely the worst line in the movie.) Moreover having the crisscrossing imposters both bed the same woman is one symmetry too many in a movie already groaning under the weight of coincidence.Its true that Scorseses added material does give The Departed a certain messy heft and richness of texture relative to the leaner cleaner Infernal Affairs. But it also tends to crowd out the quieter meditative elements. In particular while Scorsese faithfully recreates almost every scene in the original he omits perhaps its most touching moment when Leung the undercover cop runs into an old girlfriend and her daughter on the street and were subtly given to understand both that she left him because she believed him to be a real criminal and that the daughter is in fact his. Its a scene that better captures what his job has cost him than all the agonized brow-furrowing pill-popping and fighting with superiors in which DiCaprio indulges to convey the same idea.But the most problematic change from original to remake is the casting of Nicholson whose outsized persona infects the entire movie. Tsangs mob boss in Infernal Affairs was just that an inflated hood a bully whod risen to the top of his profession. But thats far too pedestrian a challenge for Nicholson whose career has for many years now alternated between paying homage to his own legend as a charming-but-dangerous satyr (Somethings Gotta Give Anger Management Wolf) and astonishing critics by playing its exact opposite (About Schmidt The Pledge As Good As It Gets). In The Departed he follows the former course imagining his Irish mobster as a Joker sans clownface a Kingpin of Eastwick. The ancient tropes are all there the grinning megalomania the adolescent witticisms the sexual bravado--and of course the marionette eyebrow he uses to tell us hes in on the joke and thus cant possibly be the joke. (Hes wrong.)Nicholsons overweening self-image flattens everything in its path. In his last film the atrocious romantic comedy Somethings Gotta Give his ladies man character treated us to his bare ass and simulated cunnilingus on an ice cream cone. In this one he shows up to a clandestine meeting with a large dildo and feigns masturbation. Why? Because hes Jack silly. He even persuaded Scorsese to film an explicit sex scene featuring him with two prostitutes though--merciful God--only a few seconds made the final cut. (Even those in which he pours fistfuls of cocaine on an unseen playmate seem to have been included for his benefit rather than ours; the shot is so fleeting it barely tracks at all.) Never you worry though While we may be spared the sight of Nicholsons nakedness his cinematic alter ego still inflicts upon us the knowledge that ""its always been so easy for me to get cunt that Ive never understood jacking off in a theater."" Thanks for sharing Jack. Im sure that there is something in this world more distasteful than listening to a 70-year-man boast about all the hot young tail hes getting; Im just not sure what it might be.Which is a pity. Because Nicholsons sexual theatrics aside The Departed is a highly entertaining movie--just not a great one. If it doesnt have much to add to Infernal Affairs that is in part because Infernal Affairs didnt need much added. (I suspect this is a typical instance where people will generally prefer whichever of the two films they saw first.) And if Scorseses direction draws a little deeply from his work on Goodfellas and Casino--""Gimme Shelter"" which he used on both previous soundtracks is used twice here--well those were awfully good movies.But a high-quality knockoff is still a knockoff. Whether one prefers Infernal Affairs or The Departed the latter stands on the formers shoulders. Indeed the only reason the remake could be made a scant four years after the original was that Infernal Affairs made the fundamental mistake common among foreign films of being in a foreign language. So box office success for The Departed? Yes by all means especially in a year as lean as the last. But an Oscar for picture or director? Please. Martin Scorsese is not so in need of charity.What he--and screenwriter Monahan--do seem to be in need of is a little more graciousness toward their Hong Kong predecessors. Back when The Departed was in the early stages of production a magazine asked me to write a short article about remakes set in Boston. The piece never quite panned out in part because during the course of my reporting Monahan (through an agent) explained that neither he nor ""Marty"" considered The Departed to be a remake. Its an absurd assertion The film is not only a remake but an unusually loyal one that apart from the noted alterations follows the original twist for twist. This effort to distance The Departed from its source material appears to have continued. In the films closings credits we first get an outsized ""Directed by Martin Scorsese"" followed by an equally huge ""Screenplay by William Monahan."" Then the stars and producers are credited followed by a second reminder that this was ""A Martin Scorsese Picture."" Then we see a full cast list the unit production manager second assistant director entire stunt crew et cetera. Only those willing to sit through three full minutes will finally be informed in modest type that the movie theyve just watched was ""Based on the motion picture Infernal Affairs Directed by Andrew Lau Wai Keung/Alan Mak. Screenplay by Alan Mak/Felix Chong."" Its as if the creators of The Departed were trying to conceal from the audience that their film was in fact a remake. And considering how little they had to add to the original one can hardly blame them.This post originally appeared at TNR.com.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Pictures As we do each Friday here are Bob Mondellos picks for this week Little Children Sara (Kate Winslet) who fancies herself a modern-day Madame Bovary lurches into an affair with a handsome stay-at-home dad whom everyone calls the Prom King (Patrick Wilson). Theyre overgrown children in a suburban playground that has lots of menace lurking at its fringes a bully who used to be a cop and a pedophile who terrifies the neighborhood when he moves back in with his mother. Lots of arrested development in a satire that develops into something more telling. Todd Field whose first feature film was In the Bedroom (this is his second) worked with novelist Tom Perrotta (author of Election which was also a smart satire) to make sure the film not only makes you laugh but makes you queasy about laughing. Full review on ATC tonight. Shortbus John Cameron the maker of Hedwig and the Angry Inch has crafted a pan-sexual romp designed to make that other fever dream of a film look downright tame. Sex -- unsimulated and definitely un-interruptus -- is both the story and the storytelling method of this precedent-busting comedy that focuses on the clientele of a sex club that feels like a really outre coffee bar. The film begins with a montage of wildly varied sexual acts and climaxes (pardon the expression) with the unsurprising revelation that love and sex are two different things. Most people old enough to get in (the film is rated NC-17) will already know that of course but Camerons film certainly takes a new tack in explaining it. His cast of mostly non-actors is game and attractive. You meet a sex therapist whos never had an orgasm a gay couple looking to become a threesome a whip-toting disciplinarian who is putty beneath her tough exterior and together with a half-dozen other principals and lots of attractive extras they copulate in about as many different locales combinations and styles as can reasonably be crammed into 90 minutes. The film is gentle generous sweet and a tad too strenuous to be as loose as it wants to be. The Departed With its overcrowded marquee -- Damon DiCaprio Nicholson Wahlberg Sheen -- and Martin Scorsese as the real draw for gangster flick fans anyway this crime thriller is a profane blood-drenched joy to watch. Based on a terrific Hong Kong thriller (Infernal Affairs) that felt like a riff on Scorsese films to begin with The Departed chronicles the intertwined travails of an undercover cop (DiCaprio) who infiltrates a crime boss operation even as an undercover gangster (Damon) finds a spot with the police. When their various subterfuges suddenly start coming unraveled each smells a rat and embarks on a furious struggle to unmask the other guy before getting unmasked himself. The plot may have a twist or two too many -- the frenetic last reel is a real head-spinner -- but the performances are so richly conceived the editing so sharp the tension so taut that no ones going to quibble. Scorseses best in years.

The mobsters young protege joins the police force and rises quickly through the ranks. Each man knows theres an infiltrator in the other group but neither knows who the mole is. The two double agents good and bad have to find out and finally they have to face off. Donnie Brasco meet Kim Philby. Just hearing the setup of this crime-movie storyline has audiences jittery with anticipation. Its rare that a plot gets people into theaters but this one already has and will again. Four years ago it was the scenario for Infernal Affairs a terrific Hong Kong movie directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak and written by Mak and Felix Chong which became one of the all-time top grossers in the ex-colony. Now it has been remade by Martin Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan as The Departed. Chances are that with Leonardo DiCaprio as the good cop Matt Damon as the bad one and Jack Nicholson as the crime boss this very entertaining densely layered just-short-of-fabulous melodrama will rustle up some sturdy box office business of its own. Infernal Affairs -- starring Tony Leung Chiu-wai (Hero In the Mood for Love) as the good cop and longtime dreamboat Andy Lau as the mobsters mole -- became its own cottage industry. It spawned a sequel (IA II) a prequel (IA III) and in glorious Hong Kong fashion at least two ripoffs (the burlesque Love Is a Many Stupid Thing and a femme version Infernal Mission). Nominated for 16 HK Film Awards IA won seven for picture director script lead actor (Leung) supporting actor (Anthony Wong as Leungs police boss) cinematography and editing. Casting Lau and Leung made for a superstar pairing equal in Hong Kong to DiCaprio and Damon -- or since the Hong Kong actors are about a decade older than the Americans to Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Leungs persona of restrained brooding and worldly-wise resignation has won him five Hong Kong Film Awards as Best Actor two more as Supporting Actor as well as Cannes actor prize for In the Mood. Lau whose retinue of teen fans follows him everywhere (hes also the most successful Cantopop singer of his generation) has been a lucrative movie commodity for two decades; in the early 90s Triad bosses reportedly fought to sign him for the films they financed. Long considered a lightweight presence Lau belatedly graduated from teen fave to compelling actor. The two main roles would be catnip for any actor. The roles after all are about acting the risk factors the men face the bravado required and the duplicity in their tasks and thus their personalities call for the subtlest pretense. And in IA both actors met the challenge. Lau smartly inverted his famously ingratiating disposition for in the movie he is fooling everyone but himself his mob patron -- and the audience. While the Leung character gets to agitate privately about his isolation as an undercover agent the Lau character never agonizes over the lie that is his life. Inside and out hes smooth as a cyborg. IA got a limited run in the U.S. two years ago (its available on DVD) and what people remember from it besides the tightening stress as the antagonists search for each other are some cool set pieces the 20min. scene of a drug deal monitored by the cops as Lau and Leung try to get messages to their contacts without being caught; a couple of tense rooftop meetings that end in death; Leungs pursuit of Lau outside a movie theater; and the moment when a taxicab is abruptly flattened out of the sky by the falling body of one of the main characters. The remake includes all of these scenes (though the last one loses some of its sick impact when the body simply lands on the street). Indeed this is a faithful version of IA -- just longer by about a half-film to flesh out the characters and give the actors more to play with. The Departed is the fourth Scorsese remake after New York New York (inspired by the 1945 The Man I Love) Cape Fear and The Age of Innocence (both from novels that had been filmed before). In 2004 the director said he hadnt seen Infernal Affairs and wasnt planning to but that almost doesnt matter. The Hong Kong movies headlong confidence in using all resources of cinema (smart-jerky rhythms a breathless narrative propulsion the italicizing of a moment by a few frames of close-up slo-mo) to relate a tale of male bonding and betrayal -- all this is so close to the style and substance of Scorsese movies he could practically play IA on the insides of his eyelids. Were in familiar Scorsese territory most assuredly though its been transplanted from New York to Boston and from Italian Catholics to Irish Catholics. The movies title comes from a Catholic prayer for the dead -- specifically for those stranded in Purgatory which is sort of a post-mortem car wash where the deceased have their lingering venial sins cleansed before they can get into Heaven. (The Prayer for the Souls in Purgatory parroted thousands of times by distracted altar boys goes like this ""Eternal rest grant unto them O Lord and let perpetual light shine upon them. May their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace. Amen."") To Billy and maybe Colin the title says ""Youre already dead lads. R.I.P."" Here the good cop is Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) a member of the Massachusetts State Police -- evidently state troopers do more than set speed traps -- who reports to Capt.

From Scorsese we want epics about stupid jerks. The Departed shares the same lead actor from his last two pictures but suddenly DiCaprio is perfect tapping into his silver-tongued weaselliness as a Boston cop lying his way into the Irish underworld. Youll have to go back to GoodFellas to find a Marty movie this fun this enamored of language of ethnic slurs of ""Gimme Shelter"" of explosive violence. Scorseses return to form is the years most dynamic film. Really how could it not be? Based on Infernal Affairs a finely complex Asian policier from 2002 (this is ten times better) the plotting has much the same wit as Face/Off with DiCaprios precarious dive mirrored by the spectacular rise of a clean-cut detective (Damon equally well cast) secretly compromising the force for the benefit of his decadent gangster patron (an unhinged Nicholson which is saying a lot). You know the two pretenders will eventually clash--our first taste is a silent cell-phone showdown worthy of Michael Manns Heat--but Scorsese ratchets up the tension in a two-and-a-half-hour feast of absorbing incident the pair sharing a feisty therapist and bed partner (Down to the Bones Farmiga) and getting off on their roles. Unexpectedly the prevailing mood is one of bizarre cutup comedy exploited by a supporting cast that would shame most topliners Alec Baldwin (in his unpredictable Miami Blues register) Martin Sheen Ray Winstone and the superbly rude Mark Wahlberg.

By David Denby Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) the thirtyish heroine of Todd Fields extraordinary new movie ""Little Children"" dropped out of graduate school to marry an older man--a business consultant--and moved into a neo-Colonial house near Boston that he inherited from his mother. Some years have gone by and the marriage is not in the best shape Sarahs husband communes on the Internet with a friendly person known as Slutty Kay and Sarah unwilling to hire any help feels imprisoned by their three-year-old daughter whom she (rather negligently) looks after by herself. Sarah is the latest version of the baffled Americans that Betty Friedan wrote about forty years ago in ""The Feminine Mystique""--the women supposedly living the American dream. Whats particularly embittering in this case is that Sarah knew all about the trap and still stepped into it. Her face pale with disgust she sits in a tiny suburban playground with three other young mothers who ruthlessly put down anyone whos even slightly different from themselves. These three witches--the only element of caricature in the movie--live on a rigidly controlled schedule. But theres an unaccountable element in their lives Brad (Patrick Wilson) the good-looking strongly built young man who makes them all flutter when he shows up at the playground with his little boy. Brad is married to a beautiful filmmaker (Jennifer Connelly) who works for PBS leaving him at home to take care of the baby and to study for the state bar exam which he has failed twice. A former golden-boy college jock stranded in adulthood Brad is decent not too bright irresistibly attractive--a man designed for adultery. As the children take their daily nap Sarah and Brad run to an empty corner of her house. If they leave town together where will the kids fit in? Theres an element of garden-variety suspense in ""Little Children"" but sex and possible home-wrecking are only part of what the movie is about. ""Little Children"" is based on a best-selling 2004 novel by Tom Perrotta who worked on the adaptation with Todd Field. Together the men have preserved Perrottas tone which fluctuates between slightly satirical even mischievous irony and the most generous sympathy. Perrotta and Field make you see how their characters are weak or screwed up without allowing you to despise them. Moral realists they know the world does not yield easily to desire. ""Little Children"" is a sharply intelligent and affecting view of suburban blues--a much bigger canvas than Fields previous movie ""In the Bedroom"" (2001) which was about a placid middle-aged couple thrown into turmoil when their son takes up with an older woman separated from a violent man. Field has grown in ambition but he still works on an intimate scale. He surrounds his characters with an intense stillness and then slowly introduces the ungovernable into their lives. Handsome Brad it turns out is not the only disturber of the peace. A convicted sex offender Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley) a polite childlike fellow has been released from prison and is living in the neighborhood with his mother. For parents who have moved to the suburbs to protect their children Ronnies presence is an unbearable outrage. Everyone is obsessed with him especially a troubled ex-cop (Noah Emmerich) who runs around putting up pictures of Ronnie and forming committees to guard against him. After a while one realizes that Perrotta and Field may be creating a metaphor of life under terrorism. Its not that Ronnie isnt a genuine threat but he causes people to lose all sense. At the least the filmmakers are hinting that both men and women are projecting their sexual frustrations and fears onto a pervert. What fuses Ronnies story and the rest of the movie is the charged suggestion that outright perversion and ordinary unhappiness (sexual indifference adultery porn obsession semi-psychotic rage) belong on the same spectrum of recognizable behavior. Almost everyone in town has a secret or at least an itch. Field works with such fluid grace and perception that the movie goes right to the top of the suburban-anguish genre. The picture is not as aggressively designed or as witty as ""American Beauty""; nor is it as malicious as Todd Solondzs ""Happiness."" Its smarter tougher closer to the common life. Field captures for instance the way the daily routines of child care--getting a kid into a car seat or a hat putting him down for a nap--have to be accommodated within the furious passions of adultery. The picture moves swiftly and surely; the separate shots that evoke the town are fitted together with uncanny precision and Field neatly pulls off a big set piece that another director might have ruined with overemphasis. When Ronnie jumps into the town pool on a very hot day the parents scream for their children and haul them out of the water leaving Ronnie in a mask alone under the surface. As the police expel the invader the children riotously jump back in and the mass hysteria followed by mass relief is both sinister and funny--an interruption of summer pleasure that intentionally leaves our sympathy split between the alarmed parents and the sad outcast. The sexual awakening of a disappointed wife may seem like an old movie turn but when has it been done with such candor? At the beginning of the movie Kate Winslets hair looks dead and she hides her body in denim overalls. Her Sarah is a slightly clumsy woman who has lost her confidence. When she falls in love with Brad the transformation comes slowly and painfully at first a nervous gesture a smile that turns anxious and then a golden aureole of beauty a body in movement. The sex scenes are brief naked heated startling. But Winslet never quite loses the awkwardness and uncertainty that will always be Sarahs signature. Brad is not a type either. Patrick Wilson a stage actor who appeared in the movie version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" has a slightly puzzled air his Brad is pleased by the attention of women but he doesnt think much of himself and Wilson as a performer seems quite without vanity. Looking at teen-age boys flying through the air on skateboards Brad falls into a rapt silence; his longing for lost youth is so defenseless that its impossible to dislike him however irresolute he is as an adult. At first Sarah and Brad seem prematurely defeated. Yet the filmmakers hold out the possibility of new life stirring under the domestic halter and the intellectual sloth. Adults may not be happier than overgrown children but at least they have a chance of finding out who they are. The small-time hoods in ""Mean Streets"" Martin Scorseses breakthrough movie from 1973 were not habitual users of the Queens English. Some of the conversations between Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel improvised on the spot would begin with one man saying a word or two then the other grabbing at the words turning them inside out flinging them back and so on until a full-scale brawl was under way in which the emotions were flawlessly clear but the sentences little more than fragments. The habit of building a tempest out of nothing became a Scorsese trademark widely imitated by other directors including Dito Montiel who made the new independent movie ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" in which almost every scene turns into a clamorously inarticulate fight. Scorsese meanwhile has moved on to a different mode of discourse. ""The Departed"" is not one of his greatest films; it doesnt use the camera to reveal the psychological and aesthetic dimensions of an entire world as ""Mean Streets"" ""Taxi Driver"" ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" did. But its a viciously merry violent high-wattage entertainment and speech is the most brazenly flamboyant element in it. ""The Departed"" is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs"" directed by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak and it has the speed and volatility of Hong Kong movies. But Scorsese and the screenwriter William Monahan have added weight to the cops-and-robbers plot by setting it in the Irish neighborhood of South Boston and by digging deep into urban tribal lore--the memories of loyalty and betrayal going back for decades the nasty old jokes the bullying insults and invective. The men commit obscene acts and speak in cynical taunts and the extreme violence and virtuoso cursing seem to feed off each other. Its still not the Queens English but every speech is complete in its profane eloquence. Jack Nicholsons Southie crime lord Frank Costello sets the tone. Frank who bears more than a passing resemblance to the notorious Boston thug James (Whitey) Bulger is not isolated in high-walled solemnity like the Italian grandees in ""The Godfather."" Instead hes walking the street where people can see him; or hes mapping out strategy from a grotty little bar. Nicholson wears a satanic goatee and mustache and his eyebrows flip up and down like semaphore flags; he gives the ultimate mad-Jack performance a free-ranging and spontaneous impression complete with Irish ditties of a man who relishes each filthy deal and bone-crushing blow. ""Non serviam"" he growls at a neighborhood kid an altar boy quoting James Joyce--by which he means that every man must refuse obedience to institutions like the Church (obedience to institutions like the Mob is another matter). The boy in question grows into Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) an ace detective in the Massachusetts State Police and he belongs to Frank tipping him off by cell phone when the police want to make a move on him. Colins opposite number--almost his twin--is Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) whos also a Statie but a straight one. After a number of excruciating initiations Billy working undercover penetrates Franks inner circle. This is a double-mole story in which the moles wind up hunting each other--the kind of interlocking narrative machinery that John le Carre used to construct in his spy novels. The deceptions of le Carres spooks however depended on the spacious geography of international espionage. In the cloistered neighborhood and Police Headquarters of this film each mole is constantly in danger of giving himself away to the people he sees every day. The story is highly improbable although Scorsese and Monahan keep the complicated goings on clear and taut and the entire movie is acted with spirit and conviction. DiCaprio his mouth pinched in tension his voice gravelly and low holds his own against Damon who has a charming and plausible line of patter as the calculating Colin. Scorsese also gets terrific work from Mark Wahlberg as a combustible but honest Special Investigations Unit cop and Vera Farmiga as a police psychiatrist who is drawn to neurotic and violent men. All the characters are unusually intelligent and the fast scurrilous talk binds the tightly edited short sequences together. Scorsese however is trying to do with words what he used to accomplish with the camera and he doesnt produce the kind of emotional involvement that once made his movies so exhausting and also so satisfying. At the end he seems eager to dispose of his characters in order to fill out a pattern one after another gets shot at point-blank range (theres hardly an actor who retains the back of his head) and shock gives way to disbelief and even laughter. ""The Departed"" is murderous fun but its too shallow to be the kind of movie that haunts your sleep.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News In the same way that the Beatles cover of Buck Owens ""Act Naturally"" or the Stones version of ""Route 66 cut to the soul of American music without being American Hong Kong cop and gangster movies have often seemed more quintessentially American than American ones are. Sometimes when deeply familiar conventions are borrowed and remade as directors like John Woo Johnny To and the team of Alan Mak and Andrew Lau have done theyre intensified -- they come back at us stronger than ever. Crooked cops challenging the survival of straight ones; bad guys whose sense of honor parallels the good-guy kind The themes that we recycle over and over again can feel brand new when we see them through someone elses lens. Genre filmmaking will never die but that kind of reinvention is its lifeblood. So there really was no need for Martin Scorsese to make ""The Departed"" -- to remake to Americanize Mak and Laus 2002 Hong Kong gangster drama ""Infernal Affairs"" a tersely structured and beautifully acted picture that few Americans got to see. ""Infernal Affairs"" was a smash in Hong Kong spawning two sequels. Here it was just another Asian-made picture picked up by Miramax and poorly distributed People had heard about it but seeing it in theaters was another story. Whatever life it had in the States it found on DVD. But what good is moviegoing if we cant find pleasure in things we didnt know we wanted? Scorsese didnt need to remake ""Infernal Affairs"" but what he has done with it is a compliment rather than an affront to the original ""The Departed"" reimagines its source material rather than just leeching off it preserving the bone structure of the first movie while finding new curves in it. The story has been clarified; the ellipses of the original have been filled in with just the right amount of exploratory shading. This is a picture of grand gestures and subtle intricacies a movie that even at more than two hours long feels miraculously lean. Its a smart shot of lucid storytelling. Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have shifted the action to Boston (the picture was shot there and in New York City) specifically South Boston a place where clannish prejudices are both a stereotype and a reality. Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan a young cop who came up from the streets of Southie in the pocket of Mob king Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Hes now part of an elite state police special investigation unit assigned to bring the elusive Costello down -- in other words Costello has a very convenient mole in the police department. But another young rookie from Southie Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) a straight arrow from a family with a long criminal history has been sent undercover to infiltrate Costellos organization from within Only two high-level detectives on the force Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg in a fine flinty performance) know his real identity. He and Sullivan dont know each other but their connection is practically forged in blood. Maybe it would be hard to mess up material with this much potential Theres a lot you can do with the idea of two young cops straining beneath the weight of the double lives they lead and Scorsese and Monahan -- and for the most part their actors -- seem to have had no trouble locating the heart of the material. People will want to compare ""The Departed"" with ""Goodfellas"" but the movies are worlds apart ""Goodfellas"" for all its violence carries nearly no emotional weight -- its a tooting fairground organ with no soul. ""The Departed"" has weight and bite although its also a thrilling entertainment. The violence is sharp and bright without being assaultive but Scorsese also makes sure were aware of its impact. We may get a jolt when a thug gets popped in the jaw and a few of his teeth clatter to the floor or feel a twinge of nausea when blood spurtles from a wounded characters mouth like water from a playground drinking bubbler. But the violence here is doled out in details not ladled with a spatula. It works in concert with everything around it. You Might Also Like The characters are fully in tune with their setting maybe partly because Monahan himself was born in Boston and several of the actors are Boston natives. (Even so viewers who can distinguish the subtleties of New England accents may notice that Wahlbergs is distinctly and authentically Dorchester while Damons Southie-speak is slightly exaggerated -- it comes from the Brattle Street end of the Red Line.) The picture gets the way class and race prejudices still divide the city despite its liberal reputation. When DiCaprios Costigan and one of his police academy buddies played by Anthony Anderson trade friendly epithets Costigan gets the last word ""Youre a black guy in Boston -- you dont need any help from me to be fucked."" Scorsese has put together a fantastic ensemble of actors Some of the movies best performances are the ones tucked into the corners like Alec Baldwins beefy arrogant state police honcho. (His caustic exchanges with Wahlbergs Dignam are some of the movies most sharp-witted moments.) Sheen with his carefully combed hair and Easter-egg paunch brings the right amount of touching realism to Queenans career cop -- he may lumber though his workday but he does so with touching dedication. Monahan has made a nifty addition to the Nicholson character one that plugs the movie right into Bostons most recent gangland saga. And Nicholsons performance a revolving palette of winks and wheezy wisecracks is entertaining. Its also a gimmick He needs to stop letting his eyebrows do most of the work for him. Damon brings dashes of style to his role particularly in some early scenes where he flirts with a crime psychiatrist played by Vera Farmiga -- forgetting that hes trying to impress her he begins a sentence with the classic Bostonian disclaimer ""No suh"" But his performance doesnt have the grave presence that DiCaprios does. This is a good role for DiCaprio Since hes playing a wily punk on the right side of the law its fitting that his boyishness hasnt yet quite jelled into manhood. And as hes forced to wade deeper and deeper into his secret life we can see how much it takes out of him His heart is so heavy it seems to weigh down even his narrow wiry body. DiCaprios performance is terrific -- but I cant say its better than Tony Leungs in ""Infernal Affairs."" Leung vested his version of the character with even deeper furrows of sadness particularly in a scene where he meets the young daughter he didnt know he had. But I think its possible to feel warmer toward ""Infernal Affairs"" than toward ""The Departed"" while recognizing the ways in which Scorsese has built on and enhanced the originals strengths. These are two modern crime dramas that serve their audience first and foremost Unlike the characters that haunt them theyre both working on the same side.

"CNN.com - Review Departed is fiercely entertaining - Oct 6 2006 Member Center <a href=""http//audience.cnn.com/services/cnn/memberservices/regwall/member_profile.jsp?source=cnn"">Sign In</a> | <a href=""http//audience.cnn.com/services/cnn/memberservices/member_register.jsp?pid=amp;source=cnnamp;url=http%3A%2F%2Faudience.cnn.com%2Fservices%2Fcnn%2Fmemberservices%2Fregwall%2Fmember_profile.jsp%3Fsource%3Dcnn"">Register</a> International Edition Home World U.S. Weather Business Sports Analysis Politics Law Tech Science Health Entertainment Offbeat Travel Education Specials Autos I-Reports Tools Save | Print | E-mail | Most Popular | Review Departed is fiercely entertaining By Tom Charity Special to CNN Adjust font size (CNN) -- What goes around comes around. No filmmaker is more movie-savvy than Martin Scorsese and he in turn has influenced a whole generation of directors around the world.There have been riffs on his breakthrough movie ""Mean Streets"" from China South America France Taiwan and the UK. ""GoodFellas""? Fuggetaboutit. Urban crime hasnt been the same since. Hong Kong thrillers in particular come with an abbreviated rat-a-tat-tat visual syntax that owes everything to the way Scorsese cuts to the quick. So if with ""The Departed"" Scorsese now feels the need to Americanize a Hong Kong cop movie well its no more than his due. Hes picked a good one too. The 2002 film ""Infernal Affairs"" may not merit those ""Godfather"" comparisons some critics threw around but for sheer nail-biting suspense and ingenuity no question its one of the outstanding movies of the last 10 years. The irony is in remaking a movie from the other side of the globe Scorsese has found a way back to doing what he does best. This is exactly what people want from a Scorsese film.Unlike recent attempts to make over Japanese horror movies ""The Departed"" doesnt lose much in translation. Screenwriter William Monahan -- whose script for ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was more interesting than people gave it credit for -- relocates the story to Boston where the Irish-American community is tight enough to keep the Mafia at bay and you can believe families might still disown a son if he signed up for the boys in blue.Adhering to the age-old principle if it aint broke dont fix it Monahan cashes in on the watertight structure pre-tested for him by ""Infernal Affairs"" screenwriters Alan Mak and Felix Chong. He swiftly sketches in a back story that places two cadets at the police academy. Sullivan (Matt Damon) quickly rises through the ranks and joins the Special Crimes Unit investigating local gangster kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). On the other side Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is busted serves some time and eventually joins Costellos coterie of murderers and crooks. Theres a twist however Sullivan is secretly working for the crime boss and Costigan is reporting back to Detective Inspector Queenan (Martin Sheen).Confused? You wont be -- the storytelling here is a model of smooth precision even as the two undercover agents try to smoke each other out into the open without giving themselves away. In addition to Damon DiCaprio Nicholson and Sheen the cast includes Alec Baldwin and Boston native Mark Wahlberg as detectives and Ray Winstone as a Nicholson henchman.In a cast this loaded with talent Nicholson pulls out all the stops to make sure he rules the roost. The battle of wits between the gangster and the chief inspector was the most engaging aspect of the ""Infernal Affairs"" trilogy but its an uneven match here. Nicholson turned down the role until it was retailored to his requirements whereas Robert De Niro had to drop out of playing Queenan to go ahead with his own directorial project ""The Good Shepherd.""In his stead Martin Sheen gives a lovely modest understated performance radiating paternalistic concern. Yet a more ambivalent hard-boiled actor like De Niro might have been better able to resist the Nicholson steamroller. An egomaniacs self-caricature Costello dominates this movie just as Daniel Day Lewiss Bill the Butcher dominated ""Gangs of New York."" In one scene a paranoid and inebriated Costello smashes his hand down on a fly and pops it into his mouth seriously unnerving Costigan and -- one suspects -- DiCaprio too. ""Eat"" Costello commands and its half a surprise that he doesnt add ""lead.""This is either great acting or atrocious scene-chewing. Maybe its both. But its sure entertaining to watch.In contrast the young pretenders Damon and DiCaprio seem bogged down in their own neuroses. No wonder they both gravitate to the same shrink a potentially dicey role played with some delicacy by the talented Vera Farmiga.His brow permanently furrowed DiCaprio plays up angsty self-disgust though Costello and his cronies are so despicable youd think he take more professional pride in putting them away. Damon meanwhile evinces steely ambition and opportunism as the crooked cop -- but he cant allow himself to enjoy it.""The Departed"" is a tough movie with tough characters and it looks it. Scorsese along with his collaborator cinematographer Michael Ballhaus ditches the high-gloss look of the original to ground this highly artificial scenario in the earthy vernacular of working-class Southies. Thirty-odd years ago Scorsese expounded on the ironies of a devoutly religious smalltime Mafioso in ""Mean Streets."" In trying to do some good Harvey Keitels character only made everything go to hell. In ""The Departed"" God is notable for His absence -- a clergyman is quickly disparaged as a pederast by Costello -- but theres still a whiff of brimstone about the place. Corruption is endemic. Lies are everywhere. As Scorseses bitterly funny parting shot makes clear its only the rats who keep the whole stinking ship afloat.(Click here to read Entertainment Weeklys review.)""The Departed"" runs 149 minutes and is rated R.

For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies. Getting called a genius isnt healthy for anybody even when its almost true. In the case of Martin Scorsese he has been praised as Americas greatest filmmaker ever since ""Goodfellas"" and just about ever since his films have taken on a heaviness -- theyre heavy with the attempt at greatness. There are no bad Scorsese movies but since ""The Age of Innocence"" (1993) he has made a string of failed masterpieces -- likable entertaining would-be spectaculars that have been slightly off lopsided or lacking. ""The Departed"" breaks that cycle. Theres no attempt at greatness here just a fabulously successful attempt at a good crime movie. The Oscar-bait self-consciousness of ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" is gone. In its place is a buoyancy an impish delight in telling a harsh urban story in the most effective terms possible. Two external proofs of the movies expert direction It makes a complicated and potentially convoluted story and delivers it to the audience with pristine clarity. And its a 149-minute film that in the experience plays as though it were less than two hours long. ""The Aviator"" was only about 20 minutes longer but Ive had entire months go by quicker than that. But ""The Departed"" moves from one colorful well-acted scene to the next thanks also to William Monahans witty well-paced screenplay. A remake of the Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002) ""The Departed"" has a clever premise at its core In the police department there is a spy working for a gang leader. And in the gang leaders crew theres a spy working for the police department. Early on both sides know theyve been infiltrated and each side is looking for the mole in its organization. Each mole is looking for the other mole and thats the story. The rest is window dressing but very good dressing. We begin with Jack Nicholson as Costello an Irish mob boss in Boston seducing a neighborhood boy into his gang by buying him comic books and groceries. Scorsese playfully shoots Nicholson in the shadows for these first few scenes. In one he is just a silhouette while everyone else is in the light. The message is clear This is the devil the spirit of mayhem the agent of destruction a monster. He is also a fun character to watch. Nicholson doesnt sleepwalk through this one but responds with a psychologically detailed portrait of an old twisted murderer. Years later the little boy that Costello took an interest in has grown up to become an ambitious young police investigator Sullivan (Matt Damon) the picture of clean-cut competence and dependability. Another young Boston officer rougher around the edges has a harder time making his way. Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) reluctantly agrees to go undercover and become part of the Costello gang. All the undercover scenes are tense -- Costello is amusing but wicked and Costigan is always in the position of trying to catch on to the esoteric aspects of gang life. For example he is told that there are guys you can hit guys you cant hit and other guys who tell you who can be hit or not. Thats useful information and its also absurd and in keeping with an undertone of absurdity that runs through the film. On the police side we have the frustrating but arresting spectacle of watching young Sullivan con everyone with his eager-beaver demeanor and aggressive charm. He picks up a police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) and even when she moves in with him she cant quite see past his former-altar-boy facade. DiCaprio and Damon have never been better. Scorsese finds big names to fill even minor roles -- everyone wants to work with Scorsese just as everyone wants to work with Woody Allen. The difference is Scorsese knows what to do with these actors once he gets them. The performances are specific and idiosyncratic the mark of a strong directorial hand. Alec Baldwin plays Sullivans boss a neighborhood guy with normally good instincts whos in over his head. Martin Sheen is a chief investigator playing him with the demeanor of a mild Catholic family man. And Mark Wahlberg steals every scene hes in as Sheens brutally caustic second in command. As ""The Departed"" wears on it becomes more exciting more grimly funny and more nihilistic -- and that nihilism has a lasting impact. When I walked out of ""The Departed"" and left the San Francisco Centre Mission Street looked like a very evil place. In fact everything looked evil and dangerous until I went home and had a drink. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations strong language and extreme violence.

And the audience gets a huge bloody profane entertainment in the bargain.A good cop-bad cop genre pic inspired by an over-the-top Hong Kong title called Infernal Affairs The Departed marks the veteran New York filmmakers first foray to Boston. Yes there are mobsters here and punk criminals high-priced hookers and rogue police but they speak a little different than they do in Mean Streets and GoodFellas. The culture is Irish American not Italian American and the scenery from the gold-domed capitol to the glass condos on the bay is cast in a different light.Like Woody Allen moving his operation from Manhattan to London Scorseses trip a couple of hundred miles northeast seems to have a restorative effect. The Departed with its mega-testosteroned cast - Jack Nicholson Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio Alec Baldwin Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Ray Winstone (and yes theres a girl - Vera Farmiga) - wheels and spins swoops and roars. Its a movie with a pulse. Sometimes it flies off the chart.Damon a native Beantowner plays Colin Sullivan a Catholic altar boy who is befriended at an early age by the local crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). A father figure and a killer Frank watches proudly as young Colin goes to school grows up and becomes a star detective in the Massachusetts State Police. An ace cop Sullivans loyalty nonetheless lies with Frank - and ""lies"" is the operative word. As a highly positioned mole in the department Damons character is living a double life reporting every move the cops make back to their No. 1 target Costello.On the flip side theres Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who goes through the Police Academy and then goes undercover - way deep - in Costellos crime clan. Costigan fierce wiry and occasionally wearing a wire works for the straight-arrow Boston cop Oliver Queenan (Sheen). Only one other guy inside the force - the gruff unlovable Dignam (Boston native Wahlberg accented-up) a guy with a ferocious bark and a truly scary hairpiece - knows whose side Costigan is on. To everybody else hes an academy dropout a tattooed thug who made his way into Costellos ranks via brutal barfights and in-your-face drug deals.The Departed then traces these two trajectories - Sullivans and Costigans - as they intersect with all the ugly double-crossing business the paranoia and rage and jump-out-of-your-seat firefights that ensue.The cast to the man (and the smartly seductive Farmiga playing a psychiatrist) moves with gusto devouring William Monahans brisk script with relish - and shots of whiskey with beer chasers. Baldwin is great as a fast-talking fed Winstone is ice-cool and scruffy as Costellos right-hand man and its great seeing Sheen being un-presidential again.And Nicholson? Hes smirking goofy and doing shtick and he practically grows whiskers for his rat speech - ""I smell a rat"" he snivels. But the old star like his old director appears stoked by the rollick_ing unpretentiousness and un-P.C.-ness of the material. (Nasty swipes are taken at multiple ethnicities and at people of various religions and sexual persuasions.)If theres a gripe to be griped about The Departed its the plots over-reliance on cell phones and text-message technology. Like Miami Vice (and The Departed is far better) the cops - and crooks - wield more flip-top mobiles and BlackBerries than they do weapons.

"A big arrival - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Leonardo Dicaprio A big arrivalmovies - reviewMartin Scorsese delivers with his mob opus `The Departed.October 6 2006|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticThe Departed is a gangster opera set to the ring tones the clap of a cell phone snapping shut. Martin Scorseses first modern gangster movie in years pops with sharp performances and bowstring-tight sequences.And if it doesnt rank with his very best movies of the genre at least hes working hard not to repeat himself. He tinkers with his proven Goodfellas/Casino formula. He complicates the number of stories hes trying to tell. And this time hes telling us an Irish mob story.Its set in Boston where old gangsters do what old gangsters always do in these movies. They say ""I remember your father."" They buy your groceries. They ask how your mother is.""Shes on her way out.""""We all are. Act accordingly.""They send flowers to your mamas funeral with a card for ""the faithful departed.""Jack Nicholson tones down his cartoonish tendencies to play Frank Costello the Great White Whale of Boston mobsters. The Feds the ""staties"" (state troopers) everybody wants to nail him. He has blood on his hands and his fingers are in the till of everything from protection to drugs to microchip smuggling.Frank as imagined by screenwriter William Monahan (Kingdom of Heaven) is a philosopher king.""No one gives it to you"" he preaches. ""You have to take it.""Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a smart short-tempered guy from ""Southie"" (South Boston) who just graduated from the State Police Academy. Hes recruited by a special task force (Martin Sheen and a rat-a-tat-tat smart aleck played by Mark Wahlberg) to go undercover to get close to the ultimate Southie Frank. Which he does almost too easily.But Billys counterpart is Colin (Matt Damon) just as smart just as rough-around-the-edges and just as freshly enlisted in the staties. But he has been groomed for his rising-star cop job by Costello himself. Colin is the ultimate rat the guy who keeps Frank one step ahead of the guy who most wants to nail him (Alec Baldwin).The Departed is at its best when it zeros in on that simple but nerve-racking mouse-and-mouse game as the two ""moles"" each try to figure out who the other is. Billy sees horrible things and commits horrible acts of his own to fit in with his new identity. Colin sees to it that his brother officers either look foolish or wind up dead in trying to pin something on wily Frank.And Frank himself? He chases younger women passes out cocaine as if it were Halloween candy dabbles in selling classified technology to the Chinese and occasionally beats or shoots somebody who gets in his way.Scorsese tries to follow three separate points of view in this epic-length thriller. But this being a post-Sopranos mob picture it has to have a lovely shrink (Vera Farmiga) who is attracted to both the good-pretending-to-be-bad cop and the bad-pretending-to-be-good one. There are obvious plot devices such as this by the score.The real Frank Costello was a New York Italian mobster who died in 1973. Interesting that Scorsese and his screenwriter would give their Boston ""Irish Mob"" boss that name. Old habits are hard to break.Scorseses stock-in-trade techniques are here. He intercuts deftly between points of view. His deadly characters play deadly fake anger scenes -- variations of the Joe Pesci ""Do I amuse you?"" bit. He textures the whole with his beloved pop and rock. Billys scenes are often set to ""Gimme Shelter"" with a judicious phrase from Badfinger here (""Guess I got what I deserved"") Van Morrison there (""Comfortably Numb""). And Franks theme is ""Sweet Dreams.""But Scorsese changes things up from his gang classics by doing away with voice-over narration by swapping an upwardly mobile Irish working class for Italian mob stereotypes of pasta restaurants black shirts and really ugly houses.Scorseses much more ambitious recent films period pieces Gangs of New York and The Aviator seem to have tempted him to burden this mob picture with topical script references to priest sexual-abuse scandals and the Patriot Act.And of course sooner or later Nicholson lets ""The Joker"" out. That signals a finale that just falls apart.Still the performances crackle with smart casting -- Damons affinity for too-smart-for-his-own-good villainy Wahlbergs street cred Sheen and Baldwins natural authority and DiCaprios arrival as a leading man-in-full vulnerable and paranoid. The movies an embarrassment of acting riches so much so that not everybody has enough to do.But The Departed is Scorseses most entertaining picture in years dense violent (more of his screen sadism played for laughs) and satisfying. Its as funny as an oddball ring tone (Irish mobsters ""Scotland the Brave""?) as abrupt as a lost call.And its a statement. As in Sopranos? Fuggedaboutit. Let the master show you how its done.

(ANDREW COOPER/AP) BY Jack Mathews NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday October 6 2006 1200 AM THE DEPARTED. Crime drama about a cop who infiltrates a Boston mob and a mobster who infiltrates the state police. With Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson. Director Martin Scorsese (229). R Strong violence language sexual content and drug material. Area theaters.4 STARS After a pair of flawed Oscar-hunting epics Martin Scorsese has returned to the gritty violent mob drama that has always been his strong suit and the result - ""The Departed"" - is his best film since 1990s ""Goodfellas."" With young stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon finally fulfilling their promise and wily veteran Jack Nicholson adding another indelible character to his rich gallery ""The Departed"" gets off to a ripping start and doesnt let up until its third or fourth twist ending. One can quibble about too many endings and about a love triangle that belongs in another story. But no one can complain about not getting their moneys worth. ""The Departed"" is a movie-movie of the first rank. Inspired by the popular 2002 Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs"" ""The Departed"" tells the story of Colin Sullivan (Damon) a Boston detective who actually works for mob boss Frank Costello (Nicholson) and Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) a state detective who has infiltrated Costellos inner circle. Costello smells a rat in his organization and Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) who heads the special investigation unit building a case against Costello smells a rat in his. But the respective ""rats"" - Sullivan and Costigan - dont get a whiff a hint or a look at each other until very late in the game. The script by former Spy magazine editor William Monahan holds this tension between the two camps throughout. Every time Costello plans an operation Costigan tips Queenan and every time the cops start to move in on Costello he gets a signal from Sullivan. In one terrifically intense scene where Costello and his men are meeting on the waterfront with some buyers of stolen goods we see Costigan and Sullivan text-messaging their respective bosses on their cell phones creating a kind of digital stalemate. The movie itself stalls whenever it pauses to build the unlikeliest of love triangles about a sensitive police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) who moves in with Sullivan cheats with Costigan and gets pregnant by one or the other. Only Tom Cruise could appreciate the depiction of a shrink this reckless. But that subplot is a minor speed bump in a testosterone-fueled movie packed with sizzling dialogue action violence suspense atmosphere and a rich array of supporting characters. Besides the three leads and Sheen Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg compete for most acerbically tough cop in Massachusetts with Wahlberg crossing the line with a distinct edge. And British actor Ray Winstone is superb as Mr. French Costellos most trusted henchman. DiCaprio who did not have the physical presence to pull off his previous roles for Scorsese in ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" is totally convincing as Costigan a temperamental gangsters son who reluctantly goes undercover to join the Costello mob and is nearly driven mad in the process. Damon who grew up in the Boston area and has the best accent plays Sullivan as if being a dirty cop were the most honorable career a kid from the streets could have. And Nicholson hitching his brow with perfect timing has taken the archetype of a ruthless uncouth mobster and made something new of it a man who can be hilariously funny and wholly menacing at the same time. It wont happen but these three guys deserve spots on the same Oscar ballot.

The Departed 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Crown him the king of the underworld. After decades of chronicling American outlaws Martin Scorsese has made his finest film since Goodfellas -- a bloody bloody-good crime saga about allegiance and betrayal within a South Boston panoply of hoodlums and cops. The Departed is a hard visceral work as unsentimental and shocking as anything the director has done. And as vicious If you dont have a cast-iron stomach cultivate one or stand clear. Devotees will note the reappearance of certain Scorsesean themes from the lost-son motif to the Judas motif to the discomfiting juxtaposition of religion and death; a prominent character dies in cruciform his arms spread-eagled against a garbage bin. The director also remains as fascinated by ethnic tribalism as he is by gangland loyalties exploring the tough Irish-Southie fealty that drives both police work and crime. Adapted by screenwriter William Monahan from the 2002 Hong Kong thriller InfernalAffairs The Departed features an intricate plot an epic scope and a cracking-good cast that includes prickly supporting turns from Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg and Ray Winstone. So massive and admirable is the whole ensemble that it seems unfair to single out just one actor but there he is Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello a Boston mob boss whos the target of a state police investigation into organized crime. Among the cops assigned to the case are Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) an upright young plainclothes man with a squeaky-clean record and Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) a cadet with family ties to several criminal bottom feeders. This makes Costigan ideal as an undercover mole and it makes the plot ripe for ironic jerks and twists As we soon learn the speckless Sullivan is a dirty cop who works for Frank. So theres a rat on the force and theres a rat in the gang and lies lead them both through a maze of deadly consequences. Damon is a cold customer here as smooth and opaque as frosted glass. No one sees through him. As his girlfriend Vera Farmiga is the opposite -- transparent mottled with doubt -- and as his counterpart DiCaprio displays a gift he didnt own only a few years back the gift of tormented average Joe-ness. Having shed the last confining bonds of it-boy superstardom hes finally just a man. His outbursts seem born of plain desperation. Its an ugly thing this film. Make no mistake. But its ugliness is rendered with such authority and humor -- such zest -- that it begins to seem like beauty. Nicholsons character alone is a monstrosity of appalling dimension and charm; Im not sure he has ever seemed less human or more beguiling and Im not sure any other actor could persuade us so well on either count. In one of the films most memorable touches Frank asks a guy in a bar about his mother. ""Shes on her way out"" says the barfly. ""So are we all"" Frank zings back. ""Act accordingly."" For all its bloodletting The Departed is an intoxicating film. Its a film thatll have your hands over your face with one eye peeking The violence sickens but the movie seduces. After the self-conscious period fetishism of Gangs of New York and The Aviator Scorsese has at last rediscovered the addictive buzz of filmmaking -- the death grip of virtuoso storytelling that grabs and shakes and startles.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 06 2006 140AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Apr. 07 2009 109AM EDT Comments AA The Departed Directed by Martin Scorsese Written by William Monahan Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Vera Farmiga Classification 18A Rating 1/2 To lovers of film especially disenchanted lovers of American film any new work by Martin Scorsese is a cause for excitement and a reason to hope. After all Scorsese is a charter member of the pantheon and directors of such talent may occasionally stray but surely they always find their game again. He certainly did in No Direction Home last years documentary on Bob Dylan although that achievement seemed partly built on the larger achievements of Dylan himself. Besides Scorseses reputation rests on his dramatic features where alas the dazzle has lately dimmed. The Aviator Gangs of New York - you had to be a senescent Oscar voter to see any overarching triumph in that twosome. Yet The Departed promised to be different and the buzz began. Rumour had it that the source material - a rejigging of the tense Hong Kong hit Infernal Affairs - was ideal for him a return to the mean streets and mobsters of his glory days. Rumour had it that the cast including Jack Nicholson in his first teaming with the director was exceptional. Rumour had it that God was in His heaven and Martin Scorsese was back on track. Rumour was wrong. Admittedly his form looks fine at the outset where two of Scorseses favourite tropes - the Stones on the soundtrack and a pre-credit sequence edited to fluid perfection - have us hopping with anticipation. So does the nifty premise which shifts the streets from New York to Boston and then pits a rat against a mole. Sullivan (Matt Damon) is a dirty detective who has worked his way up the ranks of the force - the rat furtively reports to his mob boss (Nicholson). Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an undercover cop who has infiltrated the inner sanctum of the mobsters - the mole secretly reports to his police boss (Martin Sheen). Early on the picture intercuts between them to establish their different milieus and their separate disguises. Predictably the dirty cop is having no trouble pretending to be clean but this very ease is problematic. Sullivan remains a cipher leaving Damon with precious little character to develop. He relies on his screen charm which can be considerable and his Good Will Hunting accent which is formidable yet its just so much dressing on an opaque window. Meanwhile down in the demimonde the clean cop is filthy Keeping bloodthirsty company hes getting thoroughly doused. Yes what with bullets fired between eyes and bottles smashed to faces and severed hands encased in zip-locked bags theres gore aplenty here - another Scorsese trademark from his vintage years. But back then the violence arose naturally (and thus frighteningly) out of the characterizations - out of a raging bulls jealousy or a goodfellas temper or a taxi drivers pent-up ennui. This violence however jumps haphazardly out of the twitchy plot (courtesy of William Monahans erratic script) and so it often seems gratuitous inorganic just splatter for splatters sake. Speaking of gratuitous check out Nicholson who apparently channelling The Joker mugs and rolls his eyes and delivers a performance as slovenly self-indulgent as his greasy comb-over. Astonishingly Scorsese not only does nothing to rein him in but occasionally adds an out-of-left-field sequence (the mobster in a literally operatic tryst with a couple of coke whores) that only encourages the guys theatrics. The result? Rarely has a stars look-at-me turn so completely torpedoed a project. Whenever the picture threatens to gain some momentum up pops Jack to stop it dead in its tracks. The loyal few may be laughing with him but the rest of us are definitely laughing at him and - heres how bad things get - starting to find consolation in DiCaprios far more credible work. Suffering through his enforced deception feeling ever more guilty by association he brings some actual weight to the role an anxious sense of gravity. In fact as the narratives twists bring the rat and the mole into dangerously close proximity there are moments even entire scenes when the film sparks up intensely. But something always happens to reapply the damper. Like the wild unlikelihood of a love interest (Vera Farmiga) shared by hero and villain alike. Or the sight of Sheen looking as if he airmailed his performance from the bedroom of The West Wing. Or a false climax that comes with plenty of firepower but absolutely no heat. Or a real climax whose rat-a-tat-tat insouciance suggests that Scorsese has been doing some channelling too - of Tarantino on a really off-day. The Departed we learn at one point refers to the dearly departed the dead and why not. As so often before the body count is high in a Martin Scorsese movie. But where once the bodies pulsated with life in all its vainglorious furor here they drop like wooden ducks in an artificial pond. Always there were sinners but never the sin of lifelessness.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Director Martin Scorsese has built a remarkable career by exploring the bonds of brotherhood betrayal and bloodshed among a certain species of man. In ""The Departed"" Scorsese works this familiar territory in a new city Boston delivering a star-driven film that hits grace notes but also frustrates. Massachusetts state cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) has infiltrated the mob crew headed by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). But in a plot twist lifted from the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" the criminals have returned the favor Rising young detective and mole Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an investigator with the very unit tasked with bringing down his mentor Costello. With the help of Nicholsons bluntly bigoted lead-in voiceover Scorsese sets the stage for themes of cunning and rare honesty redemption and guilt. Not that Nicholsons portrayal of Costello carries any hints of conscience. The star and his director seem hell-bent on curing us of our fondness for psychopathic mob bosses. ""I dont want to be a product of my environment"" Costello intones as news footage of Boston circa its 1970s school busing riots flashes. ""I want my environment to be a product of me."" For decades Costello achieved his objective. ""The Departed"" has many of the ingredients needed to make a significant and mournful work fidelity and betrayal lying and groping for truth. At the center are two men of seemingly similar pedigree or lack thereof set on a collision course. Yet Scorsese settles for something more ambiguous. At nearly 2 1/2 hours ""The Departed"" is involving without being particularly moving. Chalk up this awkward quality in part to its ambivalent feelings about its characters most of whom invite outright contempt. The exception is DiCaprios Costigan. A Massachusetts State Police rookie hes plunged into deep cover by his superiors Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the bullying Dignam (Mark Walhberg). The nephew of thugs Billy is the son of an upright father who died never having mixed with the criminals around him. DiCaprio and Damon bring edge and finesse to the tarnished guys they play. Damon brings more than a bit of Tom Ripley to his portrayal of the talented Detective Colin Sullivan. Sullivan rises with effortless haste to the ranks of detective for the elite Special Investigations Unit. The investigation goes nowhere fast given Sullivans relationship to the mobster. He begins his clandestine cellphone tipoffs to mentor Costello with ""Hi Dad."" Costellos salvo at the films start signals more than an insatiable will to power. The film uses his foul-mouthed introduction as if to insist theres nothing to like about Frank and his ilk. When he collects a payout from a store owner he flirts in an overly friendly fashion with the mans teenage daughter. Frank disgusts. He coerces. He seduces. He does it all in one gesture. In that same scene he recruits Colin then a fatherless pup. Alec Baldwin is a pleasure to listen to as Capt. Ellerby the head of the investigative unit. And as a Dorchester native son Wahlberg taunts Costigan like a man confronting a former self with great insight - and maybe a bit of contempt. Relative newcomer Vera Farmiga (""Running Scared"") portrays Madolyn. A police shrink with ties to Costigan and Sullivan she has the thankless task of representing female intuition as well as Freudian ideals. Neither is much of a match for Irish pigheadedness. ""You know what Freud said about the Irish?"" Madolyn challenges Sullivan on a first date. Sure I know the cocky Sullivan responds after toying with her for a few moments Freud said the Irish are ""impervious"" to therapy. ""The Departed"" exhibits a rough-hewn deft intelligence. Monahan has written some razor-sharp lines and Scorseses latest crew knows how to wield the quips. Scorsese seems to offer a corrective to his own movies such as ""Mean Streets"" and ""GoodFellas"" but also to ""The Sopranos."" These guys arent so wise and theres no mistaking them for good. Even their closest associations are varnished with distrust. Once upon a time Frank says as things begin to unravel he would have easily handled the gnawing rat bedeviling him He would have killed everyone in his crew and begun anew. As the movie approaches its finale of revelation and mayhem body counts rise. Blood pools. There are more than enough corpses to fill the morgue. Yet just like its dearly and not-so-dearly departed the film leaves us a little cold. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Hong Kong action movie Infernal Affairs has the sort of hook that would fill an arena in the rock world Two police-academy graduates work as moles on opposite sides of the law--one as an undercover cop in the mob the other as a gangster infiltrating the police department. Shot through by his most propulsive storytelling since Goodfellas Martin Scorseses remake The Departed orchestrates such a perfect balance between these mirroring characters that the film achieves a kind of musical symmetry. And in a Boston neighborhood where all the little Irish boys grow up to be cops or criminals the parallels between them are unmistakable; as Jack Nicholsons hard-nosed kingpin puts it ""When youre facing a loaded gun whats the difference?"" In Scorseses world such dreadful ambiguities coarsen the soul. The stakes are high for everyone in the movie but as the cop who goes deep undercover to take down Nicholson and his crew Leonardo DiCaprio has a look of bleary-eyed panic that reflects the hemorrhaging ulcer in his stomach. As his scheming doppelganger in the state detective office Matt Damon is a much cooler customer capable of fitting in with the guys while quietly inching his way up the ladder. The higher-ups in both organizations have sharp enough instincts to suspect a mole but with Damon denied access to undercover identities and DiCaprio barely hanging onto his life alongside the volatile Nicholson it takes time to winnow down the suspects. The unwitting lynchpin in this situation is Vera Farmiga a police psychologist who has a complicated relationship with both men. As the moles come closer and closer to getting unmasked Scorseses masterful cross-cutting between the two leads serves to tighten the noose around both their necks. Freed from the historical constraints of Gangs Of New York and The Aviator which were tied by nature to a rocky chronology Scorsese returns to the crime genre with supreme confidence and breathtaking ferocity. Right from the pungent opening line The Departed has that Goodfellas pop from the first-rate cast (Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin are wonderfully salty in support) to the sharp black comedy to the startling incidents of violence. Scorsese is revisiting familiar territory but the details are still fresh thanks not only to his usual acuity in capturing time and place but to a dense William Monahan script that nails the local vernacular. When a director of Scorseses caliber is working at the top of his game its a reminder of why we go to the movies in the first place.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Martin Scorsese wont be winning any Oscars for ``The Departed."" The movies too hard too pulpy -- too good. A relentlessly violent breathtakingly assured piece of mean-streets filmmaking the film shows the legendary director dropping the bids for industry respectability that have preoccupied him over the past decade and doing what he does best burrow to the agonized heart of criminality and let the blood and guilt splatter where they may.Adapted from the 2002 Hong Kong action film ``Infernal Affairs"" by the Dorchester-born screenwriter William Monahan  ``The Departed"" is also the closest weve come yet to The Great Boston Movie a beast that requires more honesty than filmmakers (and audiences) have been willing to grant. The films only serious flaw is that it establishes a venal and local moral wasteland crisscrossed by scummy realities of class and race that it never follows up. What begins as a blood-soaked tragicomedy about our fair towns tribal warfare turns into merely a brilliant B movie. Dont let that keep you away.``I dont want to be a product of my environment -- I want my environment to be a product of me."" So says Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) the satanic South Boston mobster who could be Whitey Bulgers even more evil twin. Narrating the films opening passages against a backdrop of news footage of the 1974 anti-busing violence Costello lays out his version of ethnic realpolitik ``Thats what the black chappies never realized. No one gives it to you. You have to take it.""MORE ABOUT ``THE DEPARTED"" To view a trailer and a photo gallery and to show off your ""Departed"" snapshots visit boston.com/films.Frank does however give a leg up to a starstruck neighborhood kid named Colin Sullivan whom he grooms for a long-term project grow up straight join the police be my in-house mole. By the time Colin is played by Matt Damon hes a canny customer on track to department success -- a rising star with the State Polices special investigative unit headed by the glib hard-driving Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). Their mission Bring down the Irish mafia in general and Costello in particular. Colins mission keep ``dad"" apprised of any incoming busts.A separate undercover unit run by Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his hotheaded deputy Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) recruit their own L Street Brownie Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) a police academy misfit with a crooked family he wants to live down. In short order Billy is jailed on a cooked-up assault sent back on the streets and works his way into Costellos mob as an informer.Thats the snappy mirror gimmick that drove ``Infernal Affairs"" -- two rats reporting on their compatriots and increasingly each other -- and ``The Departed"" takes the chess match to insanely complex levels. Both groups begin frantically seeking the traitor in their midsts and when Colin is put in charge of the department search he grimly realizes that he has to find himself. At one point Billy stalks his opposite number to a meeting with Costello and the sequence becomes a sadistic game of now-I-see-me/no-you-dont. Good and bad bleed into each other as these two sons of Southie come to understand theyre brothers in battered spirit and that only the other man can understand what each is going through.Eventually the plot spins into free fall and the bodies start piling up. You dont mind because Scorsese is so in command of his medium because the performances are juicy and committed and because the violence feels viscerally real. When people throw punches in ``The Departed"" they break their hands; when one character falls several stories to the pavement the blowback is defiantly unpretty. Costello toys absent - mindedly with an anonymous severed hand before asking an underling to ``get rid of this."" ``The Departed"" follows the consequences of bloodshed and betrayal all the way to the ugly end and you wont feel like celebrating afterward .Monahans dialogue is filthy and funny bristling with tabloid poetry ``Your familys dug into the Southie projects like ticks""; ``Youre a black guy in Boston -- you dont need my help to be completely [expletive]."" The central performances are tremendous too and for once the local accents are spot-on (mostly; Sheens still doing the Kennedys). This is DiCaprios best work in a long while and he makes you feel the suicidal craziness of ``having to be a different guy every day."" Damons playing a more multi-leveled game though and under that mashed pretty-boy face we glimpse a whole spectrum of rat emotion greed ambition cowardice and a pathetic sort of loyalty.Wahlberg almost steals the film as a pit bull of a Statie -- every time he shows up you start grinning -- and Nicholson does steal everything thats not nailed down. Frank Costello could be Jack Torrance from ``The Shining"" given a new lease on life and scraped clean of all human scruple. Hes a joyfully vulgar psycho a creature of pure id. You dont try to understand this guy -- as someone says quoting Sigmund Freud the Irish ``are the only people impervious to psychoanalysis"" -- you just run like hell.For all the excellence of the performances (which includes Vera Farmiga as a police shrink drawn to both Damon and DiCaprio; her accents wobbly but the actings right) this is a directors return to form. When Scorsese misfires here cueing the Rolling Stones ``Gimme Shelter"" on the soundtrack yet again or giving Colin a high-rise apartment with a patently fake view of the State House dome youre inclined to forgive him. When ``The Departed"" roars to life as it does in so many of its scenes you feel like nobody understands movies -- the delirious highs the unforgiving moral depths -- as well as this man does.

Yes the director has been working and reworking variations on the genre sometimes to the point of obsessiveness ever since his ""Mean Streets"" electrified the film world more than three decades ago. Here though his mastery is complete. This is the movie that Scorsese fans have been yearning to see for a very long time and its a crowd-pleaser in the bargain. ENLARGE The plot involves a deadly dangerous doubles game of cat and mouse or cat and mole. The cops -- intelligence operatives of the Massachusetts State Police -- want to take down Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) a veritable rock star of organized crime who runs the citys most powerful mob out of South Boston. To that end they send Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) a rookie who grew up in Southie undercover to infiltrate Costellos organization. But Costello has a mole in the state police; hes another young trooper from Southie Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) a rising star in the elite Special Investigations Unit. While both cops know one another neither knows the identity of the counterpart who may expose him. Plots are supposed to be dramatic engines though sometimes theyre so inscrutable that they function as brakes. Not this one which for all its complexities is readily accessible if plainly implausible from time to time and which drives the movie so relentlessly that most of its 149 minutes whiz by. (The pace slows slightly and paradoxically during the ramp-up to a climactic bloodbath.) The basic idea was inspired by ""Infernal Affairs"" a 2002 action thriller from Hong Kong and already a classic of sorts. But ""The Departed"" is an instant classic of a different sort. The screenplay by William Monahan is simply sensational. Scenes play brilliantly. Feelings flow like molten lava. The dialogue overflows with edgy wit and acidulous arias of imprecation. When the smart ambitious Colin considers renting a Beacon Hill apartment within sight of the State Houses golden dome the real estate agent says ""You move in and youre upper class by Tuesday."" Its a casual joke but a meaningful one because ""The Departed"" is very much about class. It is also about loyalty friendship family good and evil (theres a surprise for a Scorsese film) savage violence (another surprise) cellphones (the plot wouldnt work without them) the passage of time and a fragrant sense of place. After shifting the setting from Asia Mr. Monahan wrote a script that could only come fully to life in Boston. (The superb Michael Ballhaus did the cinematography the production was designed by Kristi Zea and the film was edited by Thelma Schoonmaker.) ENLARGE Matt Damon (left) and Leonardo DiCaprio as police officers on opposite sides of the law in The Departed The performances are phenomenal. At the height of his powers Jack Nicholson plays Frank Costello shrewd and lethally funny but essentially straight without self-parody; somehow this singular star has found his way back to the commanding simplicity of his work in ""Chinatown."" Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio have never had richer roles or been more strongly anchored in them (though oddly theyre less effective in the few scenes that find them confronting one another). The flawless supporting cast includes Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Ray Winstone Vera Farmiga Alec Baldwin and Anthony Anderson. And through it all Martin Scorsese maintains a control thats all the more amazing for its lightness playfulness and invisible precision. The film hardly feels directed at all. The Queen When you find yourself in the presence of Her Majesty Elizabeth II according to useful information dispensed by ""The Queen"" you must bow or curtsy before venturing forward to shake her outstretched hand. When youre in the presence of Helen Mirren as the Queen you must marvel for thats all you can do at first at Dame Helens literal self-effacement. Vanished is the vibrantly attractive crisply energetic star of ""Prime Suspect"" and ""The Long Good Friday."" In her place is a prim septuagenarian peering out from behind big spectacles coiffed to greet the 1940s in case they return and marching around Buckingham Palace in sensible shoes with a peerlessly privileged stride looking exactly like you know who. But thats only at first. Soon Mirren starts to work subtle magic -- not too strong a word -- on a role that has room for it. She finds the woman inside the monarch just as the movie finds stirring drama inside the monarchy. Thats not to say that this marvelously smart funny and entertaining film which was directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Peter Morgan (who co-wrote ""The Last King of Scotland"") doesnt find the royals behavior ridiculous. Prince Philip in particular is a frozen popsicle stick without the popsicle and the Queen herself is painfully ludicrously out of touch with her nations commoners -- in other words with almost everyone outside the palace or the Windsors 40000-acre preserve in the wilds of Scotland. But ""The Queen"" has no truck with ridiculing Britains royals as Londons tabloids so often do. To the contrary the film takes a single searing event -- the death of Princess Diana -- and uses it to contrast the monarchy stultified by tradition with the thoroughly modern government of Tony Blair (who is played bright-eyed and blazingly articulate by Michael Sheen.) Blair and his media-savvy people get the significance of the event immediately Diana was ""the peoples princess"" and the people want a state funeral. The royals demur rigidly Diana was no longer an HRH so her death is not an affair of state. If the story went no further it would be interesting enough. But ""The Queen"" shows in fascinating detail Tony Blair trying to save the monarchy from itself and the Queen hitherto imprisoned by her role coming to realize that her seeming insensitivity is damaging the institution she has sworn to serve and protect. Last year Helen Mirren played to deserved acclaim Elizabeth I on TV. Now shes a deeply affecting Elizabeth II. Thats not quite a hat trick but its a crown trick and she pulls it off magnificently. Little Children ""Little Children"" was directed by Todd Field whose debut feature was the memorably powerful ""In the Bedroom"" and was adapted by the director and Tom Perrotta from Mr. Perrottas novel of the same name. This film is memorable too for its depiction of a gilded suburbia in which unhappy husbands and wives are as heedlessly childish as the young sons and daughters at the center of their lives. Mr. Field is a filmmaker with an exceptional gift for directing actors -- hes an actor himself -- and an eye for telling detail. (His cinematographer here as in the previous film is Antonio Calvache and again the images are quietly sumptuous.) Yet I was put off by ""Little Children""s satiric tone or by its tones which range from archly fastidious neutrality (a narrator reading brief passages from the book) to insistently shrill melodrama (a disgraced ex-cop turning vigilante when a convicted sex offender comes back to town). Tone may seem like a minor matter when measured against the films ambitions and achievements. Many of the performances are strong Kate Winslet as Sarah unsuited to her motherhood but refusing like her heroine Emma Bovary to accept a life of unhappiness; Patrick Wilson as Brad a handsome aimless house-husband who longs to recapture his youth; Jennifer Connelly as Kathy Brads smart but naive wife. The storys concerns are fragile virility and craven hypocrisy as well as angst and anomie. The sex offender Ronnie played scarily well by Jackie Earle Haley isnt the only pervert in town; hes the only pervert whos been publicly labeled as such. Yet tone is the carrier wave of a dramas signals and the signals in ""Little Children"" are distorted by intrusive devices (an abruptly split screen an occasionally surreal sound track) and heavy ironies (the fatuousness of older women in a book club the faux-mythologizing of a football game Brads elaborately juvenile glee in the company of teenage skateboarders). When a movie is as serious and perceptive as this one it doesnt need to comment on itself.    DVD TIP Martin Scorseses ""Goodfellas"" (1990) was better than good. Like ""The Departed"" this violent saga of the gangster life gloried in its own virtuosity (which is not the same as commenting on itself.) The screenplay based on Nicholas Pileggis non-fiction book ""Wiseguy"" was written by the director and Mr. Pileggi. The cast includes Ray Liotta Robert De Niro Joe Pesci Paul Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco. As in ""The Departed"" the film was shot by Michael Ballhaus and edited by Thelma Schoonmaker.

"Martin Scorseses The Departed reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Martin Scorseses The Departed reviewed. Martin Scorseses The Departed reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 5 2006 642 PM Of Moles and Men Martin Scorseses stylish The Departed. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens Spoiler Special about  The Departed by clicking the arrow on the player below The Departed In an exchange early in The Departed (Warner Brothers) Martin Scorseses big slick and snappy remake of the Hong Kong blockbuster Infernal Affairs the Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) asks an underling how his sick mother is doing. ""Shes on her way out"" sighs the aging gangster. Costellos retort ""We all are. Act accordingly."" (Say this line in your broadest Jack Nicholson impression and youll get the idea.) Scorsese lives by that nihilist dictum in The Departed seizing the Andrew Lau original between his teeth and gobbling it whole. After the strained artfulness of Gangs of New York and The Aviator hes back to making movies like theres no tomorrow and that cant help but be a good thing. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Departed isnt the masterpiece I have the feeling some may hail it as. It feels like the kind of movie critics might overpraise if only because its nice to see Scorsese back in the saddle and a treat to find a cops-and-robbers thriller with some energy and wit. But even so its a stylish head rush of a movie that flies by even at two-and-a-half hours and keeps turning the knife (and your stomach) up to the final scene. Advertisement A lot of those twists come courtesy of the movies neatly symmetrical double-agent premise. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is a mole planted in the Massachusetts State Police by the sadistic and paranoid Costello. To all appearances Sullivan is a choirboy of a cop heading an anti-organized-crime unit under police Capt. Ellerby (Alec Baldwin)and his hotheaded right-hand man Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). Sullivan garners praise for his dogged pursuit of Costello even as he feeds the gangster tips on how to evade arrest. He also charms a police shrink (Vera Farmiga) into falling in love with him and moving into his swell apartment financed unbeknownst to her by mob money. Meanwhile Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is Sullivan in reverse A perpetual screw-up who was kicked out of the police academy hes recruited to go deep undercover as a member of Costellos gang. So deep undercover that Costigan winds up serving as witness if not accomplice to a sickening succession of brutal crimes (and rest assured that Scorsese shows them to us in gory detail). Racked by guilt and in constant fear for his life he begs to be taken off the detail but the higher-ups keep putting him off holding out for the one big bust that will finally nail Costello and shut down his organization. In Infernal Affairs every plot twist clicked satisfyingly into place as the fate of the two leads converged inexorably toward a central vanishing point. The good guy pretending to be bad and the bad guy pretending to be good What better setup for a classic existential and moral riddle? But here for every ""aha"" moment theres an equal and opposite ""ouch."" Its hard to get into details without spoiling something in a movie this rife with double agents and triple fakeouts but much of the two informants surveillance--conducted by means of text messaging on barely concealed cell phones--is implausible to the point of absurdity and the ending leaves several red herrings flopping on the deck. The movie opens on stock shots of racial unrest and protests in 1960s Boston suggesting a political metaphor thats never followed through on. Later Costello pontificates to Costigan about the artistry of John Lennon while brandishing a severed human hand. Unsettling and bizarre yes but what does this scene mean? Is Nicholsons unhinged Costello supposed to personify some generational type the dark nadir of entitled boomer-ism? Or is he just a random sicko? The role of Costello expanded significantly from that of the crime boss in Infernal Affairs is evidently based on the real Boston gangster Whitey Bulger. But Nicholson who brags about having done no research for the role serves Bulger up with a side of Jack Torrance and a twist of Randle McMurphy. Nicholson is often hilarious here but I would have liked to see him mute the wackiness a little in the interest of the movies overall tone. The cutesy last shot which Ill leave as a surprise for the viewer seems complicit with the jokiness of Nicholsons performance and it does a disservice to the seriousness (not to mention gruesome violence) of much of whats gone before. Though The Departed has flourishes of black comedy throughout its not Prizzis Honor; its a truly dark movie in which many people die horribly and ending on a goofy visual pun makes fools of the audience for caring. Ive always had a slight animus toward Damon and a downright grudge against DiCaprio but both are excellent here. They even start to resemble each other as the film goes on two sweet-faced boys with hollow cores who can lie their way into and out of whatever they want. As the foul-mouthed putdown artist Dignam Wahlberg cant deliver a line without cracking the audience up. He shines even amidst a uniformly strong cast just as he did in I Heart Huckabees. And Vera Farmiga who was so searing in last years Down to the Bone is an unusual casting choice for the love interest. But she works In a movie about the deadly zero-sum game of masculinity her wispy cerebral presence suggests the possibility of a different world one in which not every conflict need tend toward mutual annihilation. Unfortunately its not a world the wise guys of The Departed are ready to live in. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

"An inside job well done - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW An inside job well doneIn `The Departed its police spy versus mob mole as Scorsese brings it all to a boil.October 06 2006|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer FREQUENTLY excessive but never dull ""The Departed"" is a little too much of a lot of the things that define Martin Scorsese films but its also almost impossible to resist. Too operatic at times too in love with violence and macho posturing at others its a potboiler dressed up in upscale designer clothes but oh how that pot does boil.The key to the success of ""The Departeds"" cops-and-robbers tale of connivance duplicity and deception is a crackerjack premise that comes courtesy of Hong Kongs 2002 ""Infernal Affairs."" Written by Alan Mak and Felix Chong that film was a monster hit both at home and throughout Asia that spawned two sequels and was acquired by Miramax but never released theatrically in Los Angeles.The idea is that in the midst of a war between the police and organized crime each side succeeds in placing a clever mole in the heart of the other camp. Gradually each spy discovers the existence -- but not the identity -- of his opposite and as the noose tightens and the tension ratchets past the cracking point each man struggles furiously to unmask his rival before he himself is revealed and destroyed.Scorseses film set in Boston and starring the powerhouse combination of Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson duplicates several of the themes of ""Infernal Affairs"" and borrows numerous key scenes and even a few lines of dialogue from the original.That said screenwriter and Boston native William Monahan (who did Ridley Scotts underrated ""Kingdom of Heaven"") has done a persuasive job lengthening and deepening the Hong Kong story adding plot and character complexities and ending up with a film that is a full 50 minutes longer than the original. A cross between a B picture and grand opera ""The Departed"" features dialogue that alternates between unblinkered obscenity and tangy lines like ""hed kill seven people to cut my throat and he could do it.""Having a strong story and script has energized both Scorsese (returning to the gangster genre for the first time since 1995s ""Casino"") and his actors. In addition to its trio of marquee names ""The Departed"" showcases excellent work from a wide range of performers including Mark Wahlberg Martin Sheen Ray Winstone Alec Baldwin and in the role that may finally break her through to the wider recognition she deserves Vera Farmiga.But even though it has a lot thats worth showing off ""The Departeds"" florid determination to be showoff-y to take pride in bravado is periodically worrisome. Though a story like this has to traffic in excessive violence and unsettling language its not essential to flaunt those elements. Unlike Clint Eastwood in ""Mystic River"" (a similarly dark story with the same Boston locale) Scorsese has a need to periodically go over the top that will either be to your taste or not.The same is true for Jack Nicholsons central performance as criminal kingpin Frank Costello a.k.a. Mr. C the Irish godfather of his Boston neighborhood. Introduced with a voice-over monologue that practically drips aphorisms (""People say youre a product of your environment; I want my environment to be a product of me"") Costello is the kind of boss who knows everyones secrets and takes care of his own.Its the intention of ""The Departed"" to mythologize Costello to see him as a criminal lion in winter charismatically unconcerned about his frazzled hair and questionable taste in clothes. The film trades successfully on Nicholsons legendary presence to do this perhaps too much so. For every moment when Nicholson gets it just right and there are plenty of those there are others where the performance feels indulged more than is good for it.Costello is introduced taking a paternal interest in a young neighborhood boy. A decade passes in moments and the boy is Colin Sullivan (the always reliable Damon) a new member of the Massachusetts State Police assigned to the Special Investigations Unit under Capt. Ellerby (a gleefully profane Baldwin). Hes supposed to be investigating Costello but hes actually on the mans payroll tipping his mentor off to what is going on.The other ""statie"" in the film is Billy Costigan (DiCaprio). We meet him being verbally taken apart by Capt. Queenan (Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Wahlberg with the films most authentic Boston accent) of an undercover unit. They want to know whats inside Costigan because they want him to go so deep undercover in Costellos organization even he will have trouble remembering what side he is on. Which is pretty much what happens.Most of ""The Departed"" is gainfully employed with these kinds of cat-and-mouse maneuvers as the two men different sides of the same coin play out their double and triple games in an exceptionally violent world. Whenever one of the films numerous indulgences threatens to disrupt things strong acting and the wheels-within-wheels plot dont let it happen.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESGibson doing the inside jobDecember 18 2006Braves Not Affected by Inside JobMay 17 2003Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/06/entertainment/et-departed6,200,thedeparted23,thedeparted,latimes

By J.R. Jones Jr_Jones The Departed sss Directed by Martin Scorsese | Written by William Monahan | With Matt Damon Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg Ray Winstone Vera Farmiga Anthony Anderson and Alec Baldwin The Last King of Scotland ssss Directed by Kevin MacDonald | Written by Jeremy Brock and Peter Morgan from a novel by Giles Foden | With Forest Whitaker James McAvoy Kerry Washington Gillian Anderson and Simon McBurney Martin Scorseses underworld thriller The Departed opens with a voice-over from its larger-than-life villain a Boston crime lord played by Jack Nicholson who declares ""I dont want to be a product of my environment; I want my environment to be a product of me."" Its the most personal statement in this highly commercial movie Scorseses most popular and critically acclaimed films have defined the violent urban drama (Taxi Driver Raging Bull GoodFellas) but through a series of ambitious and eclectic projects hes resisted being defined by it himself (The Last Temptation of Christ The Age of Innocence Kundun). One neednt be a ruthless mobster or a restless film director to understand these antithetical urges--we all yearn to belong somewhere but that sense of belonging always exacts a price usually in the form of allegiance. If ever a Scorsese film was one for the fans The Departed is it. You can just imagine him lining up the next head-splat gunshot scene muttering ""Just when I thought I was out they pull me back in"" A remake of the 2002 Hong Kong cult hit Infernal Affairs The Departed transplants the action to South Boston but the location doesnt really matter; the two operative cultures here are the state police and a local mob run by the monstrous old-timer Frank Costello (Nicholson). The complicated plot involves two young spies each groomed for years to infiltrate the opposing side. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) a promising but volatile young cadet with family ties to Costello is recruited by the upstanding Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) for a years-long undercover mission hell be convicted of felony assault and expelled from the force and after serving a prison term hell work his way into Costellos gang. But long before this plot is hatched Costello is positioning his own rat Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) a loyal kid from the neighborhood who becomes a state trooper and wins an assignment to a special investigative unit on organized crime. Neither spy knows the others identity and as each settles into his secret life he begins to lose track of himself. Its a classic doppelganger setup Sullivan and Costigan may be mortal enemies but they have more in common with each other than with anyone else. Sullivan is orphaned and living with his grandmother when Costello comes into his life and the mobsters patronage gives him a sense of place thats worth more than any amount of easy money. Costigan had spent his childhood shuttling between his mothers North Shore home and his fathers low-rent digs in Southie and for him a state police uniform is a symbol of stability. Both young men identify strongly with their respective father figures and each is confronted with the paradoxical situation of defining himself by posing as something hes not. (""We deal in deception"" Queenan tells Costigan. ""What we do not deal with is self-deception."") For each character the rub comes when his patriarch is suddenly removed from the equation and his link to his original identity is erased--the cop suddenly finds himself mired in a life of crime and the criminal is safely ensconced in the law enforcement community. With its welter of double crosses The Departed is completely engrossing a master class in suspense. But in moral terms it may be the least involving story that Scorsese--an artist much preoccupied with morality--has ever taken on. Costigan spends years working for Costello unencumbered by the legal restrictions of being a sworn policeman but hes never forced to do anything that truly repulses him; his only on-screen transgressions are a few beat downs of scumbags who have it coming anyway. Sullivan takes advantage of his badge to romance a lively police psychiatrist (Vera Farmiga) but the relationship never prompts him to examine what hes doing with his life. The mentors are comparably one-dimensional Queenan is a devout Catholic with sepia-toned photos of old-time cops hanging in his modest home Costellos a depraved hedonist who flings handfuls of cocaine over his nude girlfriend. In keeping with the storys obsessive symmetry The Departed seems to operate on two distinct levels as a dumbly pleasurable game of cops and robbers and a coldly cerebral Skinnerian exercise. Scorsese seems to acknowledge as much in his final shot a punning image of a rat skittering across a railing. The Last King of Scotland also tells the story of a young man who falls under the sway of a charismatic leader--in this case Idi Amin the brutal dictator who terrorized Uganda in the 70s. The compelling Glaswegian actor James McAvoy (Rory OShea Was Here The Chronicles of Narnia) plays Nicholas Garrigan a fictional Scotsman with a newly minted medical degree whose taste for adventure and resentment of his father a bourgeois physician propel him to Uganda in 1971. He works briefly at a small clinic but soon grabs a more prestigious post personal physician to Amin who has just staged a successful coup against President Milton Obote. Forest Whitaker gives a titanic performance as the general--by turns charming and sinister vulnerable and vengeful--and as he seduces the naive young man into his murderous regime director Kevin Macdonald unpacks the ignorance and arrogance that still characterize the Wests attitude toward Africa. Garrigan may be a fool but hes more human than anyone in The Departed. Captivated by the sights and sounds of Uganda he first experiences Amin at a colorful rally where the general wows the crowd with his exuberant nationalism. Amin a devoted fan of Scottish culture since his days in the British army wins over the doctor by appealing to their common resentment of England. When a crisp British diplomat (Simon McBurney) approaches Garrigan to spy on the general the doctor rebuffs him arguing that the UK is galled by the prospect of a truly independent Uganda. Flattering himself an anticolonialist allows Garrigan to discount the money women and prestige that accompany his growing importance as Amins adviser. But his illusions begin to fade after he warns the general about a colleagues possible treachery and the man is disappeared. Amin brushes off the doctors protestations of ignorance ""Do not pretend to yourself that you did not know. You are a stronger man than that."" By the time Garrigan learns about the death squads roaming Uganda in search of Obote loyalists his apartment has been ransacked and his British passport stolen. Of course no Western director can make a movie about Africa without being accused of colonialism himself and some critics have faulted The Last King of Scotland for focusing on its white hero as black corpses pile up around him. But although the movie takes place on an international political stage its still a drama of individual allegiance. Amin seems just as confused about his proper place as Garrigan he may proclaim himself the father of Uganda but he also fancies himself the last king of Scotland and stages bagpipe concerts in the middle of equatorial Africa. In real life by the end of the decade hed been overthrown fleeing first to Libya then Saudi Arabia where he died in exile in 2002. The danger in trying to find a place you truly belong is that you might wind up nowhere at all.

"With Departed Scorsese Breaks a Few Funny Bones washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies With Departed Scorsese Breaks a Few Funny Bones Gangs of South Boston In Martin Scorseses latest plumbing of a subculture Leonardo DiCaprio sets out to join Jack Nicholsons mob. (By Andrew Cooper -- Warner Bros. Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 6 2006 Martin Scorsese is back in fighting trim with ""The Departed"" a punchy crime drama that crackles and pops with the brio of the directors best-loved films. A richly textured portrait of yet another American ethnic subculture -- the Irish mob in South Boston -- ""The Departed"" may not drill quite as deeply as his most anthropological core samples (""Mean Streets"" ""Goodfellas""). Nor does it aspire to the historical gravitas of ""Gangs of New York."" But in its own way this outing -- an adaptation of the well-regarded Hong Kong action thriller ""Infernal Affairs"" -- does something more important precisely in what it doesnt do which is take itself too seriously. As they might say in Dorchester its a wicked kick in the pants. Indeed a deranged sense of humor weaves its way through ""The Departed"" from outrageous opening scenes introducing the sulfurous crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to its eye-roller of a final shot. The playfulness marks a welcome diversion amid Scorseses signature scenes of explosive violence and soaring arias of vulgarity and misanthropy which otherwise would look like rote exercises from the directors playbook. In large part the humor in ""The Departed"" can be found in Nicholson himself who delivers a crafty utterly winning performance as a ruthless amoral monster. Within the first two minutes of the film where the camera follows Costello into a South Boston package store Nicholson has succeeded in making the audience loathe his character; within the first three minutes hes managed to make us love him. Its a neat trick that only an actor of Nicholsons skill could attempt and only a star with his accrued capital of goodwill could pull off. Throughout ""The Departed"" Costello -- a leering equal-opportunity offender who doesnt hesitate to profanely confront cops fellow criminals or the local clergymen -- keeps viewers teeter-tottering between revulsion and vicarious delight. ""Hows your mother?"" Frank asks the young Bill Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio). ""On her way out"" Costigan replies. ""We all are. Act accordingly."" Bill who grew up part time in the neighborhood where Costello has held sway for decades has just been released from prison and is looking to join the elder statesmans crew. Meanwhile across town another son of Southie Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is investigating Costello as part of a mutual operation between the FBI and the Massachusetts State Police. Just whos investigating whom becomes increasingly murky as the cat turns into the mouse and turns into the cat again. Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan do a terrific job of keeping the proceedings legible enough to follow but just twisty enough to keep the audience wondering if theyve missed something. Cut with characteristic precision and polish by Scorseses longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker the picture drives hard through the by-now familiar Scorsese tropes the bravura tracking shots the ritualized male aggression the frisson-inducing music cues. If the directors use of the Rolling Stones ""Gimme Shelter"" in that opening scene suggests a filmmaker going back to the well once too often he makes up for it later with a scene featuring Van Morrisons cover of ""Comfortably Numb."" That music accompanies a sensuous love scene between DiCaprio and newcomer Vera Farmiga playing a therapist who becomes entangled with both Costigan and Sullivan. Her role upon reflection isnt structurally important but their scenes with her allow both actors to break out of the stranglehold of a movie that would otherwise be just plot-action-plot. This is DiCaprios third and best movie with Scorsese who seems to have finally managed to erase all the baby fat from the perennially young actors persona. Even more of a revelation is Damon who delivers a complicated convincing and often surprisingly spontaneous performance as a politically ambitious cop. It doesnt hurt that South Boston and its tribal subtleties are things Damon knows well; when Sullivan looks longingly out of his apartment at the Massachusetts Statehouse its impossible not to see a slightly harder-edged version of Will Hunting behind the gaze. ""The Departed"" is owned by its troika of lead actors all of whom take possession with the assurance and muscle thats required of them. But the films novelty its giddy exuberance is to be found on the edges. Mark Wahlberg as a feisty obscenity-spewing detective bites into his scenes with the gusto of a man enjoying a good lobster; Alec Baldwin as one of his superiors takes similar relish with a role that recalls Joe Pesci -- not the homicidal psychopath of ""Goodfellas"" but the fast-talking sharpie of ""My Cousin Vinny."" Together the two provide the most explicit humor in a movie that unlike any other Scorsese picture isnt afraid to be seen going after laughs. (The best lines are unrepeatable in a family newspaper.) Presumably its Monahan -- a Boston native and former editor at the satirical magazine Spy -- who can be thanked for the scripts spot-on Southie vernacular as well as its antic sense of fun. But Scorsese is to be commended for taking something of a risk at this point in his career. Its possible throughout ""The Departed"" to see a 63-year-old director trying hard to prove his swaggering-young-man bona fides whether in scenes designed to shock (Costello re-breaking someones arm in a cast then later distractedly removing a wedding ring from a severed hand while talking about John Lennon) or the films final bloodbath in which Scorsese looks like hes trying to out-Scorsese himself. But for the most part ""The Departed"" represents both a fond look back on the roots of a great filmmakers artistic life and a new expansiveness. As that final shot suggests the man who once set out to make the audience wince now seems more inclined to leave us laughing. The Departed (149 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong brutal violence pervasive profanity some strong sexual content and drug material.

Running time 151 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity sex and drugs). At the Empire the Cinema 1 the Chelsea others. HOORAY. Martin Scorsese has stopped chasing that elusive Oscar long enough to return to his roots with the crime thriller ""The Departed"" his sharpest film in a decade - and the most entertaining major studio release this year. Its a crackling ultraviolent adaptation of the popular Hong Kong action hit ""Infernal Affairs"" transposing that movies ingenious plot to Boston where a pair of informers are working at cross purposes. The state cops have spent years planting Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) a former trooper with underworld connections in the inner circle of Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). The terrific twist is that Costello has been nurturing his own spy Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) - whos become a big shot in the state cops special investigations unit charged with taking down Costello. Neither man is aware of the others existence at first. While the ice-cold Colin seems to have his double life down pat despite some close calls the strain is taking a toll on Billy who resorts to drugs to cope with the brutal world in which hes taken up residence. That world includes not only the increasingly unhinged Frank - whos not above waving around a severed limb in a plastic bag to make a point - but his even more casually brutal lieutenant Mr. French (British actor Ray Winstone). On the other side the politically ambitious Colin is clashing with his boss (Alec Baldwin) as well as with the troopers (Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen) who are secretly supervising Billy. Suspense ratchets up - and the protagonists suspicions begin coalescing - when Frank tries to make a big score. A bravura sequences cuts between Billy - who is trying to set Frank up for a bust - and Colin who is desperately trying to tip off Frank behind his ostensible bosses backs. The profanity-laced but witty and literate dialogue by William Monahan (""Kingdom of Heaven"") is delivered by a brilliantly chosen cast almost all of whom are operating at the very top of their game. As the agonized Billy DiCaprio shows a gravitas largely lacking in his previous outings with Scorsese ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator."" Damon is rock solid though he is often upstaged by his fellow Bostonian Wahlbergs electrifyingly profane outbursts. Vera Famiga is very good as Colins psychiatrist girlfriend who in the films biggest plot contrivance begins treating Billy - and more. The most enjoyable performance is from Nicholson though Scorsese indulges the actors eccentricities - he doesnt disappear into his character the way the rest of the cast does. I could also complain that ""The Departed"" is overlong at 21/2 hours - but whos keeping track when youre having so much fun?

"`Departed a return - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs `Departed a returnDirector finds his footing (for half a film at least) in this `Infernal Affairs adaptation`THE DEPARTED (star)(star)(star)October 06 2006|By Michael Phillips Tribune movie criticAfter the dolled-up theatrics of his last few features from ""Casino"" (1995) up through ""The Aviator"" (2004) its a kick to find director Martin Scorsese back in prime form at least in the terrific first half of ""The Departed."" The second half of this Boston-set thriller based on the sleek more sparingly brutal 2002 Hong Kong export ""Infernal Affairs"" cant quite match it despite a few bursts of startling violence handled as only a first-rate director can. One question that comes to mind during that second half is actor-related. If anyone other than Jack Nicholson had played the big bad crime boss would the film have been 10 or 15 minutes shorter simply because NObody talks in a more preDICtable meTHODical RHYthm even when hes fully engaged than Jack NICHolson?In his third meetup with Scorsese following ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" top-billed Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan a Massachusetts police academy cadet. Costigans mobbed-up South Boston family makes him dubious cop material but excellent fodder for undercover work. Taking orders from Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and endless grief from Queenans number two (Mark Wahlberg) Costigan infiltrates the inner sanctum of Costello played by Nicholson. After a year the strain of all the lying and for DiCaprio all the brow-furrowing starts eating at him.Nicholsons Costello has planted his own mole among the police. He is the stalwart-seeming Special Investigations Unit officer Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon. While trying to learn the identity of the undercover rat Sullivan deceives everyone including his lover (Vera Farmiga whose angular features look stolen from a Modigliani painting) the state police department shrink whos drawn to Costigan as well.This is not daisy-fresh narrative territory. Scorsese hasnt so much improved upon a fine trim thriller (the Hong Kong version was 50 minutes shorter) as pulled a grandiose and confident variation on it. Remarkably for much of ""The Departed"" Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan balance the parallel stories of Costigan and Sullivan flawlessly. Aided by the razor-sharp editing of Scorsese regular Thelma Schoonmaker the films technique and pacing allows you to enjoy Monahans ripest dialogue without worrying about whos uncovering whom.Monahan used to write for Spy magazine and it shows. ""Do you want to be a cop or do you want to appear to be a cop?"" Sheen asks DiCaprio casually. Announcing a new mode of cell phone surveillance being used on Nicholsons gang Capt. Ellerby (Alec Baldwin) jumps up and down like a kid on Christmas morning. ""Patriot Act Patriot Act--I love it"" he says. In a saloon where DiCaprio has just walloped somebody to a pulp a Nicholson associate warns him that the injured party ranked halfway between ""not a guy you cant hit"" and ""not quite a guy you cant hit."" David Mamet would be proud of such distinctions.While Nicholson relishes his role there is such a thing as too much relish. ""The Departed"" overexploits its villain or thats how it seems with Nicholson playing him. The actor has become a curious case of someone full of surprises in the most unsurprising way. Nicholson has a ball wrapping his mouth around the grunge-Runyon argot but its all play-acting all the time. Thats the idea in ""The Departed""; everyones acting a role. But would it kill Nicholson to hurry it up? Hes in a Scorsese movie for heavens sake.DiCaprio and Damon are fine but in a mobbed-up copper-ridden genre exercise like this you tend to notice the players with the natural authority. The guys here are Baldwin and Wahlberg who not coincidentally get all the best zingers. As a loyal Costello underling British actor Ray Winstone likewise nails each slack-jawed look and weary realization of his lot in life like a master.Certain things the director does here he has done before and he will no doubt do again. Many times Scorsese not-so-subtly cranks up the volume on the background music whenever violence is about to explode. He adds impish visual touches such as silent movie-style iris shots as well as cuts and compositions recalling ""The Third Man"" and ""Psycho."" The best of ""The Departed"" moves with the assurance and swiftness of ""GoodFellas."" The most expendable stuff in it by contrast is just that--stuff that slows the narrative without making it any more meaningful.The film makes a stab at social commentary by way of Costigans raging class issues. It also makes a stab at Scorseses familiar theme of corrupt fathers and vulnerable sons. But whats a couple of knife-stabs against so many guns? ""The Departed"" exists in a movie-place about as far from personal statements as a storied director can get. Maybe those days for Scorsese are long gone. But Scorseses sense of craft remains sure.`The Departed(star)(star)(star)Directed by Martin Scorsese; screenplay by William Monahan based on the film ""Infernal Affairs""; cinematography by Michael Ballhaus; edited by Thelma Schoonmaker; production design by Kristi Zea; music by Howard Shore; produced by Brad Pitt Brad Grey and Graham King.

Im happy to say its better than that. Comparisons to ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" notwithstanding it has a verve and texture all its own. It also has courtesy of William Monahan some of the best dialogue that Scorsese has ever worked with.Unlike Scorseses other gangster pictures ""The Departed"" works both sides of the fence. Its about both crooks and cops although some of the cops are technically crooks. And the setting is Boston rather than New York which means that everybody in the cast gets to try out their accents. (A few like Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon already have them.)Damon plays Colin Sullivan a south Boston kid who early on was befriended by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) head of the Irish mob and now acts as his mole inside the Massachusetts State Police Departments elite special investigations unit. Leonardo DiCaprios Billy Costigan an unruly cadet in the police force is picked by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his bullying aide Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to infiltrate Costellos mob. They even put him in jail for a time in order to bolster his bona fides with the bad guys. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But who are the bad guys exactly? Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Much is made in this movie about the tissue-paper-thin morality of law enforcement and the empathy between thugs and police. Sullivan and Costigan raised in the same tough neighborhood but unaware of each other are practically twins. Both are impostors living double lives. Unbeknownst to each other they even share the same woman a psychiatrist played by Vera Farmiga whose curiosity overrides her clinical instincts.""The Departed"" shares its basic story line with the 2002 Hong Kong cult hit ""Infernal Affairs"" but Monahans script is a thing entirely unto itself. I dont really buy into the films grandstanding about identity and deception. Costigans identity crisis and his repugnance for inhabiting an underworld he furiously rejects would have more weight if we saw more of who he was before he was drummed into service as a mole.What really links the police and the perps is their almost Joycean love of language. They get a sensual pleasure in the way their vitriol rolls off the tongue. David Mamet or Terry Southern in his prime would have had a hard time matching these words.Scorsese knows exactly how to use his players for maximum effect. He knows for example that Wahlberg is best showcased in small doses that Alec Baldwin shines in character cameos that Nicholson in yet another of his bravura turns is at his most original when hes flying high. Nicholsons Costello is both mythic and mundane - a legend in the community who is at the same time all-too-distressingly mortal.He places himself on the front line of drug deals not because he needs to be there but because he likes being the hood ornament. Hes a grungy peacock who becomes increasingly knockabout as things unravel.DiCaprios performance is a revelation only for those who have underestimated him. In Scorseses previous films ""The Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" he seemed callow and miscast but here he has the presence of a full-bodied adult. Hes grown into his emotions.An argument could certainly be made that ""The Departed"" which boasts a body count almost as high as Hamlet is not much of a stretch for Scorsese. After all crooks are crooks whether they be from New York or from Boston. But how can you complain when youre having so much fun? Grade A- Rated R for strong brutal violence pervasive language some strong sexual content and drug material.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Id like to begin by thanking the Academy -- for snubbing Martin Scorsese. Regardless of their respective merits Scorseses last two pictures Gangs of New York and The Aviator felt like hat-in-hand pleas for acceptance by an organization that considers Crash Chicago and American Beauty among the greatest of recent American films and which holds Scorsese himself in considerably lower regard than Robert Redford Kevin Costner and Rob Marshall. But with his new picture The Departed Scorsese seems to have abandoned his Gollum-like quest for golden trinkets and the result is the best thing hes done in ages -- an exhilarating pulp entertainment.Based on the popular 2002 Hong Kong action drama Infernal Affairs The Departed tells the story of Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) a bright young rookie in the Massachusetts State Police who owing to some undisclosed family ties to the Beantownmafia gets hand-picked for a top-secret assignment. ""Do you want to be a cop or act like a cop?"" Costigan is asked by an avuncular captain (Martin Sheen) and his pit-bull sergeant (Mark Wahlberg) before agreeing to sacrifice his identity and be reborn as a petty thug seeking entrance into the criminal machine of mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Costello who didnt get to where he is without careful career management has planted his own mole the seemingly squeaky-clean Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) inside the very Special Investigations unit that has sent Costigan undercover.Infernal Affairs written by Alan Mak and Felix Chong and co-directed by Mak and Andrew Lau Wai Keung was a diabolically clever wind-up machine executed with precision timing and air-tight internal logic and The Departed effectively preserves its central tension -- which rat will be the first to sniff the other out -- and most of its jackknife twists and turns. In just about every other respect Scorsese and the Boston-born screenwriter William Monahan (who writes dialogue that is like morsels of juicy steak in the actors mouths) go about putting their own stamp on things.For starters where the Chinese film (and its subsequent prequel) aspired to a kind of modern Greek tragedy The Departed is a full-tilt Grand Guignol splatterfest in which the brain-blowing and bodily dismemberment commence early and dont let up until the final retributory act. (When it was released in China Infernal Affairs had a moralistic re-shot ending tacked on to it at the behest of the Chinese censors; here Scorsese and Monahans unfailing Catholic guilt prompts them to come up with one of their own devising.) And where the original films diminutive arch-villain was civil enough to sit down to dinner with his police pursuers Costello is a preening baroque sadist who in one scene uses a severed hand as an instructional tool and in another sports a blood-drenched blazer as though it were tailor made. In a performance that ranges between over-the-top and over-the-moon Nicholson seems to be channeling his horny little devil character from The Witches of Eastwick -- only its carnage not eros that gets Frank Costello hard. And hes enormous fun to watch. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm The Departed marks Scorseses third consecutive collaboration with DiCaprio and its the first one in which you really understand what the director sees in his young muse. While I admired DiCaprios Howard Hughes in The Aviator more than his woefully unconvincing lover-fighter in Gangs there was still precious little sense of an inner life to the character. He was fine as Hughes the hotshot entrepreneur but as Hughes the toenail-and-urine-preserving obsessive he was a jumble of actorly ""technique"" in search of a center. Here there are a few scenes in which you fear for the worst -- during his first meeting with the court-ordered shrink (Vera Farmiga) who also happens to be Sullivans live-in girlfriend DiCaprio so self-consciously mimics the young Robert DeNiro that you wish Farmiga would reach over and slap him. But for most of the movie as Costigan plunges deeper into Franks crew and as those few who know his true identity begin dropping like flies DiCaprio harnesses a terrific buggy intensity reminiscent of GoodFellas hopped-up Henry Hill (Ray Liotta).Some will inevitably claims that The Departed is nothing more than a kind of greatest hits collection for Scorsese who is certainly no stranger to stories of urban jungles seething with the ambitions of hot-blooded Guineas and Micks. Even I wouldnt rush to call the movie one of Scorseses best -- it doesnt dig deep under the skin of its characters in the way of a Mean Streets or a Taxi Driver and as a study of undercover police work it rarely ventures more than ankle-high into the muddy psychological waters of this summers Miami Vice. But like the blaring classic rock ballads he has long favored for his soundtracks (""Gimme Shelter"" and the electrifying Van Morrison cover of ""Comfortably Numb"" are among the highlights here) Scorseses hits are nothing to sniff at. Indeed the very vibrancy of this movie is tied to its familiarity to the thrill of seeing ""Marty"" shrug off his yen for enshrinement in some ersatz canon and rekindle the old razzle-dazzle -- the pulse-quickening energy the restless zooms and tracking shots the explosions of gory violence -- that once made every young film student in America want to be him (before they decided they wanted to be Tarantino instead). Maybe just maybe he might finally nab that elusive Oscar. But if so I hope he doesnt bother to show up.THE DEPARTED | Directed by MARTIN SCORSESE | Written by WILLIAM MONAHAN based on the motion picture Infernal Affairs directed ?by ANDREW LAU WAI KEUNG and ALAN MAK and written by MAK and FELIX CHONG | Produced by BRAD PITT BRAD GREY and GRAHAM KING | Released by Warner Bros. | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Weve moved to Irish Boston where hotheaded rookie Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is ostensibly turfed out of the force as a cover for his long-term assignment while ambitious hood Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) signs up for the State Police Academy and speedy promotion. Their respective controls are police Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and capo Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).William Monahans screenplay retains the basic architecture and several bits of business from the original pepping it up with snappy macho banter including some of the most gloriously expressive swearing this side of David Mamet; senior officers Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg spark off each other like an obscene double act. But its somewhat distended; its two decades since Scorsese made a feature less than two hours long and he shows no sign of belt-tightening. The simple mathematical tragedy of Infernal Affairs is mussed by extra layers of hierarchy on both sides and a frustratingly over-seasoned climax.The casting however is quite a coup. Theres still something boyish about both Damon and DiCaprio and both do best as characters who play make-believe but get lost in the game (see The Talented Mr Ripley and Catch Me If You Can). Here they approach their impostors from different ends of the spectrum DiCaprios Costigan starts out an agitated loner and gets more tightly wound while Damon makes Sullivan cocky relaxed one of the guys. For a truly laidback performance though look no further than Nicholson. I dont wanna be a product of my envi-o-ment I want my envi-o-ment to be a product of me his opening voice-over drawls - and boy does he get it. Hes every inch the big cat in his dotage pulling rat-faces and pratfalls in a bar grandstanding in a porn theatre. The mans a movie star and its a ridiculously enjoyable spectacle but it feels more like Jack holding court on Oscar night than a crime lord about his work. You wonder if The Departed may have been more fun to make than to watch; at any rate its pleasures lie in the way it permits us membership of the gang - not that homophobic ribaldry and gags with severed hands are everyones idea of fun. Theres a hint of self-pastiche on Scorseses part a suspicion that hes appealing to past successes. But few directors can compose a movie with the power grace and assurance that Scorsese brings to each shot and scene and The Departed is more fun and certainly more funny than his last few films. Probe it for more than back-slapping entertainment however and you might start to smell a rat.

Posted October 4 2006 -- 1200 AM EDT The argot of New Yorks Little Italy is Martin Scorseses first language but the filmmaker speaks fluent pungent Bostonese in the terrific cops-and-mobsters tale The Departed. And no wonder That old Southie nabe in the shadow of downtown bureaucracy and yet a world apart from it is not so different in its clannish insularity from Scorseses. Boston scrod or Elizabeth Street scampi whats the diff? In embracing this new locale Scorsese creates a movie built on the foundations of GoodFellas and Mean Streets but not chained to it a picture that feels as effortless as The Aviator and Gangs of New York felt effortful. Like many a smart urbanite Scorsese appears to have used travel to another city to broaden his vistas. (After visiting London for Match Point Woody Allen must know the feeling.) And that unclenching brings out the best in his instincts which in turn allows him to bring out the best in his actors Complicated compelling Leonardo DiCaprio for one reaches a new career high in this his third Scorsese picture. Consider the setup The Massachusetts State Police (in Beantown slang theyre ""Staties"") are intent on bringing down Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) a Boston Mob boss impervious to the inconveniences of the law. To that end Southie-bred police cadet Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is sent undercover to infiltrate Costellos organization. Aside from Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) no one on the force knows of Costigans assignment. But moles burrow both ways. Rising young sergeant Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) falls in with the Staties Special Investigations Unit reporting to his own unit commander Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). Colin is as snappy and upwardly mobile as Billy is scruffy and dead-end a status-conscious yuppie. While he appears to be investigating Costello with zeal it just so happens that since altar-boy childhood this particular homey has been secretly loyal to Costello who essentially groomed Sullivan to work for him on the inside -- tipping him off to police maneuvers that sort of thing. And to make matters even more complex Colins classy girlfriend Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) a police psychologist is also involved with Billy -- hes her patient. The Departed comes by its puzzle pieces honestly -- the movie with an outstanding script by Kingdom of Heaven screenwriter William Monahan is a relatively direct adaptation of Infernal Affairs a great 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller steeped in Chinese conundrum and Hong Kong aesthetics. But where Infernal Affairs is less interested in psychological nuance than in Eastern-style elegance of action Scorsese and Monahan showcase Western-style actorly character building at its most enjoyable. DiCaprios adult intensity as a young man agonizing over the disappearance of his real identity under the weight of playing someone he isnt is matched by Damons thoughtful restraint. Wahlberg -- a charismatic always underrated natural -- digs into his own Mean Beantown Streets background and comes up with surprising fury. Sheen freed from West Wing presidential responsibilities imbues his cop captain with a surprising pathos. As the one woman in an all-male saga Farmigas Madolyn hints at female secrets and personal sadnesses probably not necessary to the film but welcome nonetheless. The learned (or in the case of Wahlberg resumed) Boston accents sound ripe but right with Baldwin adding his own audience-pleasing oomph to the exercise. And lest anybodys wondering The Departed is splattered with moments of pure dead-eyed blood-soaked Scorsesean violence -- the pop-pop of bullets and oof-oof of beatings that explode skulls and smash faces. (Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and production designer Kristi Zea give the whole enterprise which shot mostly in NYC a grimy gray Bahston Hahbuh look.) Im not sure what Nicholson is doing in two rococo scenes one with a rubber sex toy and another entertaining two women at the opera -- goofing around I think with more Jack-ness than the director should have put up with. On the other hand Costello is the flashiest guy on the street as well as the most dangerous. Working with Scorsese for the first time Nicholson provides a menace thats half silky half seedy. The very title The Departed suggests a James Joycean take on Irish-Catholic sentiment when of course this story is anything but Its Scorsesean and hes in full bloom.

Whats new is that hes hitched his swirling white-hot style to the speeding wagon of narrative. For all his brilliance storytelling has never been his forte or his first concern. Here he has the devilishly convoluted plot of the terrific 2002 Hong Kong cop thriller ""Infernal Affairs"" to work from and its a rich gift.Screenwriter William Monahan has done a terrific job transposing the story to ethnically fraught Boston. Hes added many savory (and unsavory) new elements while staying true to the cat-and-mouse twists and turns of Alan Mak and Felix Chongs original script. (Strangely theres no acknowledgment that its a remake until deep into the end credits.) ""The Departed"" is the tale of two moles. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is a clean-cut rising star in the Boston Police Departments Special Investigative Unit which is determined to bring down the kingpin of the Irish-American mob Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). But in fact hes Costellos man groomed since childhood to infiltrate the police force. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who grew up trying to escape from his working-class criminal background is now up to his neck in mob activities working as Costellos trusted associate. What only two people in the world know is that hes actually a cop planted to tip the police to his bosss every move. Desperately unhappy to be forced into the identity he tried to escape hes becoming emotionally unraveled. The plot thickens when both sides realize that theres an informer in their midst and the search for the rat begins. The task of uncovering the mole inside the force is assigned to Sullivan who is the mole while the paranoid volatile Costigan must pretend to find the mobs Judas before he gets discovered and whacked. Complicating matters further both men fall for the same woman the psychotherapist Madeleine (Vera Farmiga) who doesnt know eithers secret.The symmetries and complications are pitched on the edge of absurdity and Scorsese dives headfirst into the fray simultaneously playing it for maximum suspense and a kind of mad blood-spattered comedy. You often find yourself laughing and gasping at the same time. Nicholsons gaudy racist foulmouthed mobster first shown only in satanic shadows is a flamboyantly depraved villain and Jack plays him with Jacobean gusto. But the entire cast is firing on all cylinders. The first half of the movie belongs to Damon oozing the confidence charm and false modesty of a master deceiver. DiCaprio his eyes unable to mask the torment of a man whose identity is slipping away from him dominates the second half. This is DiCaprios coming-of-age role hes finally put boyhood behind him. Then theres Mark Wahlbergs mad-dog Ser-geant Dignam a cop whose default mode is raging irrational hostility; Alec Baldwins hilariously blunt police supervisor Ellerby; Martin Sheens Queenan who calls the shots for Costigan and is as much his father figure as Costello is for Sullivan. Its a great ensemble rounded out by Farmigas smart decidedly unconventional shrink. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week ""The Departed"" is Scorseses most purely enjoyable movie in years. But its not for the faint of heart. Its rude bleak violent and defiantly un-PC. But if you doubt that its also OK to laugh throughout this rats nest of paranoia deceit and bloodshed keep your eyes on the final frames. Scorseses parting shot is an uncharacteristic but well-earned wink.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Departed The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; departed-the ) Departed The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Departed is a perfect example of why remakes shouldnt be dismissed out of hand. Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have taken the B-grade Hong Kong crime flick Infernal Affairs and re-imagined it as an American epic tragedy. The original film was gritty and entertaining; the new version is a masterpiece - the best effort Scorsese has brought to the screen since Goodfellas (ending a decade-long drought of disappointments and near-misses). In making The Departed Scorsese has retained the essential plot structure of Infernal Affairs but has transformed the movie into something truly his own. Characters are better defined and situations are given an opportunity to breathe. None of this is done at the cost of pacing; The Departed is as suspenseful as anything the director has previously achieved. This movie deserves mention alongside Scorseses most celebrated movies Taxi Driver Raging Bull Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) both start out life on the streets of Bostons Irish American community which is presided over by gangster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). From there their paths diverge. After a rough youth Costigan enrolls in the police academy with the goal of becoming a state trooper. Sullivan also becomes a cop but for a different reason - hes Costellos right-hand man and will provide him with valuable inside information. Meanwhile Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) have hand-picked Costigan for a crucial job infiltrate Costellos inner circle. Its a role he accepts and succeeds at although not without difficulty. Thus begins a high-stakes game with Costigan sending back information to the cops about Costellos plans while Sullivan counters by leaking police intelligence to his boss. Both moles know there are leaks but neither is aware of the truth about the others position. On-screen talent pools dont get much deeper than this one with A-list actors like Martin Sheen Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin accepting supporting roles. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon prove two crucial things they are not interchangeable and when pushed by someone who can direct actors they can give riveting performances. DiCaprio has displayed growth in each of his appearances for Scorsese and this is by far the best work he has done in his career. Jack Nicholson is in top form providing a diabolical villain who can deliver a monologue with unparalleled verve. His part is showy enough that it will be virtually impossible for him to be ignored at Oscar time. Up-and-coming actress Vera Farmiga and British tough guy Ray Winstone round out a cast that if not perfect is close to it. The consistent levels of intrigue and tension are among The Departeds high points. Scorsese draws viewers in with a captivating monologue delivered by Nicholson at a time in the past (the date is not specified but it is presumably the early 1980s) which includes the most memorable two lines in Monahans screenplay ""I dont want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me."" After this quick introduction the scene shifts to the present. It takes a little while for the ins-and-outs of the setup to become clear but once the sides are established and the cat-and-mouse games begin the suspense begins to slowly simmer. Even knowing what was coming (from having seen Infernal Affairs) I remained on the edge of my seat. Unlike many remakes this one feels fresh not recycled. The two characters to profit most from this re-envisioning are Costello whose role has been expanded to provide Nicholson with more screen time. Its understandable - few actors can add more color to a bad guy than Nicholson and he relishes every moment in front of the camera. Unlike in Batman where he chewed the scenery he avoids going over-the-top and this makes Costello as frightening as he is magnetic. As Madeleine a woman caught between Costigan and Sullivan Vera Farmiga also benefits. Until now the actress has largely flown under the radar (despite a significant role in the box office dud Running Scared) but this should be an opportunity for her to garner some notice. (Had Robert De Niro played Queenan as was originally intended no doubt the Captains role would have been enlarged. However when De Niro became unavailable due to scheduling conflicts Martin Sheen was brought in.) Thematically The Departed fits well with the directors oeuvre. The movie concentrates on family and betrayal and what constitute both. The lead characters are loners but they are linked to the world of Boston gangsters by blood ties. Each also commits at least one betrayal but the question becomes ""Who are they betraying?"" Its not as easy to answer as one might suspect. In the murky waters of double agents moles and rats loyalty isnt a facile commodity to gauge. Every character ultimately earns his or her fate except perhaps one. Two technical hallmarks of Scorseses films are in evidence. Michael Ballhaus cinematography is intense and moody. Even though a significant portion of the movie was shot in New York City the feel is ""all Boston."" Howard Shore provides the score but the most notable aspect of the soundtrack is the near-perfect song selection. For the third time in his career Scorsese uses the Rolling Stones ""Gimme Shelter"" (see also Goodfellas and Casino). He also employs a cover of Pink Floyds ""Comfortably Numb"" during a key sequence. Since this is a gangster film theres plenty of bloodletting and profanity although one could argue that The Departed is tame compared to some of what Scorsese has given us in the past. Nevertheless seeing the respected director back at the top of his game with a movie that could be both commercially and critically successful is a source of jubilation. The movies have been in the doldrums lately; The Departed is a much needed tonic. Its also one of 2006s best features.

Different from the directors earlier crime dramas in its shared focus on cops rather than on just the goodfellas this reworking of a popular Hong Kong picture pulses with energy tangy dialogue and crackling performances from a fine cast. Mixing it up with modern mobsters for the first time since ""Casino"" 11 years ago Martin Scorsese cooks up a juicy and bloody steak of a movie in ""The Departed."" Different from the directors earlier crime dramas in its shared focus on cops rather than on just the goodfellas this reworking of a popular Hong Kong picture pulses with energy tangy dialogue and crackling performances from a fine cast combining to give Warner Bros. a winning hand commercially in all markets. After the elaborate exertions of the period pieces ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" its good to see Scorsese back on home turf at least in a figurative sense since the setting this time is Boston rather than New York. Not that hes especially scaled down this time out; the complexity of the crises formidable dramatis personae hefty running time and long-arc drama make this a big picture. But the film intensely concentrates on conflict and character thereby sweeping the viewer up in a tale of epic deceit in which nearly everyone is compromised and comes to no good. From a plot point of view ""The Departed"" closely follows its 2002 progenitor ""Infernal Affairs"" a big Asian hit and crime buff fave which like its follow-up prequel and sequel remained little seen in North America. Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan (""Kingdom of Heaven"") who has stated he made a point of not watching the original film and worked only from a translation of the Chinese script make the material their own by anchoring the story deeply in the Irish South Boston mob in the milieus particular culture and societal attitudes. For those who want reassurance Scorsese is re-embracing the ""GoodFellas"" aesthetic its there right at the outset. With the Rolling Stones ""Gimme Shelter"" setting the mood an imposing man addresses a nice Irish kid at a working class soda fountain and presses money into the kids hand enticing the boy into his circle. Some years later the older man comes into focus as crime kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) while the kid has grown into a rising star of the Massachusetts state police force Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) -- long since placed on this path as a mole by Costello. The police repped by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his right arm Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) long frustrated by their failure to nail Costello carefully pick a candidate to infiltrate Costellos inner circle. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a ballsy cadet who has had no advantages in life. They stick him in jail for a time to give him credentials that may pass Costellos muster. Thus are two shrewd steely young men unbeknownst to one another placed within the same milieu with the same contacts but at dueling purposes. Its a wonderful set-up for a pressurized high-wire drama with ample psychological overtones one thats been impressively constructed like a trap and pays off with appropriate bitter tragedy. Along the way there is plenty of room for tantalizing confrontations consideration of human beings capacity for courage and corruption and stylistic doodling. Of all the ingredients in the pot the one that jumps out and grabs you is the language. Man can Monahan write dialogue and not just goombah threats and vulgarities although hes great with those. Wahlberg playing his bosss bad cop other half delivers outrageously insulting tirades faster than Rodney Dangerfield could spit out self-deprecation and has half of the scripts best lines. Most of the rest belong to Nicholson whose old devil likes to crudely ruminate on sexual matters -- he upbraids two priests and a nun in a restaurant for their would-be perversions -- and is also capable of succinct philosophizing; when told by an associate that his mother is ""on the way out"" Costello replies ""We all are. Act accordingly."" But the heart of the film belongs in the conflicted ambiguous middle between the outright criminal and the occasional righteous uncorrupted cop. Sullivan who is the picture of the savvy red-blooded sometimes less-than-principled Irish big-city cop is able to shine at his job while still managing to tip his patron off to any threat. He puts engagingly brash moves on a shrink Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) who treats traumatized cops as well as criminals and they soon become a couple. But if through lifelong preparation Sullivan has largely learned to cope with his double life for Costigan its a daily struggle. He passes Costellos brutal are-you-a-cop tests with remarkable strength and never cracks under the watchful eye of the bosss untiringly suspicious enforcer Mr. French (Ray Winstone). Costigan also enters Madolyns life putting her at the intersection of an eventual showdown one imagines would send her to a shrink as well. The propulsive movement and sweat-inducing situations inevitably recall ""GoodFellas"" but the sensation here is somewhat different. The earlier film felt like it was on speed itself. ""The Departed"" has a exaggerated Grand Guignol quality to it in the way it combines rock n roll and opera on the soundtrack and in its accommodation of the play-acting at its core. The heightened style may also be a way of making room for Nicholsons performance which is theatrical in a very entertaining way. At times hes right on the money conveying as convincingly as anyone could the attitudes of a tough old bastard whos had things his own way all his life while at other moments he flies off into an uncharted orbit for which the director tries to make room. Operating a bit closer to terra firma DiCaprio is outstanding as the audiences main point of emotional contact a man gravely at risk every moment of his life (one minor issue is an uncertainty over how much time the main action encompasses). In his third collaboration with Scorsese DiCaprio has rarely been this vital energized or passionate. Damon delivers impressively as well. Thesps receding boyish qualities merge well with the role just as a hint of his Jason Bourne hardness adds the necessary ruthless edge to the repellently interesting character. Supporting cast is sparkling down the line led by Wahlberg who steals every base on the field and takes them home. Boston boys Damon and Wahlberg set the bar with their accents while some of the interlopers notably Nicholson are in and out. Craft contributions are superb. Michael Ballhaus widescreen lensing has a wonderful clarity to it and an unforced sense of composition while Thelma Schoonmakers editing nimbly juggles the numerous characters and potentially confusing events without fuss. Kristi Zeas production design particularly the open look for the police h.q. and the modernism she brings out of old Boston plays a major role in shaping the films character.

Maybe youll think so too if you dont pay a lick of attention to whats onscreen. Or maybe youll recognize The Departed for what it is a new American crime classic from the legendary Martin Scorsese whose talent shines here on its highest beams. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> The title card sets the scene boston. some years ago. And were off watching Leonardo DiCaprio as a cop pretending to be a hood and Matt Damon as his opposite. Both are trapped in circumstances where you cant tell the good from the bad. All the actors bring their A games to this triumphant bruiser of a film its darkly wanton wit the only defense against complete chaos. DiCaprio and Damon give explosive emotionally complex performances but it must be said that Jack Nicholson reaches undreamed-of heights of decadent devilment as Irish mob kingpin Frank Costello. Whether hes wielding a gun or a dildo buying off cops dissing Catholic priests as pederasts seducing children into a life of crime letting it snow cocaine on favored hookers or chatting while elbow-deep in blood Nicholson is electrifying. Dispassionately executing a woman on a beach Costello notes to his henchman Mr. French (a terrific Ray Winstone) ""She fell funny."" But Costello is no campy Joker. Channeling James Cagney in White Heat and Paul Muni in Scarface Nicholson leeches out the glamour to create a landmark portrait of evil. William Monahans stinging script a revelation after his murky meandering in last years Kingdom of Heaven transfers the plot of the terrific 2002 Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs to his native Boston so he can drill down to its depraved core. Those familiar with the gangs of Beantown will see Whitey Bulger -- the Irish thug still being pursued by the FBI -- in Nicholsons sick twist of a character. This is vital visceral filmmaking indebted to Michael Ballhaus vibrant cinematography and Howard Shores evocative score boosted by Scorseses typically astute soundtrack choices -- a unique uniting of the Stones John Lennon Nas Van Morrison the Beach Boys and Patsy Cline. And once again Thelma Schoonmaker turns editing into an art form. Shes the wizard at Scorseses side getting the action to jump off the screen while setting up psychological provocations that reverb hellishly in your head. Ignore the irrelevant fan-boy questions Will Scorsese finally win his Oscar? Is The Departed as brilliant as GoodFellas? Is it too gory to be a blockbuster? The Departed flawed by a few underwritten characters and some overwrought imagery (the symbolic rat) pins you to your seat. Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Damon) unknown to each other are both trainees at the Massachusetts State Police Academy. For Billy its a goodbye to the Southies the South Boston criminal element that formed him. For Colin its a chance to play mole for Costello who trained him since boyhood. The drama intensifies when Billy is told that he will never wear the Statie uniform. His father figure Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) wants Billy to go undercover and infiltrate Costellos crew. Billys identity will be known only by Queenan and his flinty enforcer Sgt. Dignam (a locked-and-loaded Mark Wahlberg gives a supporting role major dimensions). Colin who thinks the Statie uniform makes you look ""dressed to invade Poland"" joins the suits led by Capt. Ellerby (the reliably superb Alec Baldwin) in the Special Investigations Unit. And so two rookies assigned to rat out the people they work with begin to unravel from the strain of maintaining identities antithetical to their true natures. As in Infernal Affairs theres a heap of coincidence. You might want to revoke the films dramatic license when Billy and Colin both fall for Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) the shrink who treats Billy and moves in with Colin. Luckily Farmiga (Down to the Bone) is a glorious actress a combustible mix of smarts and sex appeal who reveals that Madolyn is as lost and off-the-rails as the two men. The violence? Most of it is saved for the films final act where its enough to give you whiplash. Scorsese correctly refuses to go wussy on the corruption that extends from Costellos nest of vipers to the State House whose gold dome Colin sees from the window of his chic apartment on Beacon Hill. Damon building on his no-bull turns in Syriana and the two Bourne films brings a coiled-spring intensity to Colin whose double life is taking ts toll (for one thing hes often impotent). Scorsese allows telling glimpses of the child in these men. Colin dreads betrayal by Costello the thug who filled his scrawny twelve-year-old arms with groceries and made him his slave. Billy uses drugs to numb his fear but cant find anything -- family friend lover church government -- to trust. DiCaprio does himself proud in a risky role that stabs at the heart as Billys bravado loses the battle to his jangling nerves. Though DiCaprio and Damon share only one big scene their climactic rooftop face-off reflects the films bleak view of a world where nothing is held sacred. Scorsese doesnt need gore to make his points. A scene with Billy and a vibrating cell phone matches Hitchcock for suspense. Another deftly borrowed from The Third Man simply involves Madolyn walking past Colin at a funeral her impassive gaze deadlier than a speeding bullet. Issues of sin redemption identity and loyalty resonate in Scorseses films including the atypical Kundun Age of Innocence and The Aviator. Each new film absorbs the others creating a body of work that can stand with the greatest. Scorsese tops the list of American directors because even when he fails he strives passionately to make movies that matter. The Departed a defiantly uncompromised vision of a society rotting from the inside is one of his best. Act accordingly.
