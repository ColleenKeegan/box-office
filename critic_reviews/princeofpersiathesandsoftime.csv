In 2004 Bnei Sakhnin a poorly funded northern Israel soccer club made up of Arabs Jews and foreigners won the prestigious State Cup and vaulted into the esteemed Premiere League along the way becoming a symbol of Middle East coexistence. Director Browne (A League of Ordinary Gentlemen) opens with this euphoric victory but truly trains his gaze on the subsequent year when elevated expectations internal bickering and mounting losses threatened to sabotage the squads potential for fostering harmony in the hostile region. Throughout the teams struggles on the pitch generate tension but the films most potent conflicts are off the field whether it be captain Abbas Suans attempts to live up to his nation-healing responsibility or the way in which Arab and Jewish fans are drawn to root for their own. The resulting portrait is a cautionary rejoinder to typical sports-movie uplift elucidating how athletics remain a dangerously precarious foundation upon which to construct lasting peace. (Nick Schager) (Music Hall) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - KITES Indian-made and trilingual in Hindi Spanish and English Kites is set and was mostly shot in the American Southwest -- although in its backlit visual overkill complete with neon reflected in rain-drenched streets it more closely resembles some of the most overwrought Hong Kong gangster romances of the late 1980s. Jay (Hrithik Roshan one of Hindi cinemas most engaging leading men) rolls off a freight train with a gaping bullet wound and a lot of backstory to unload. A con artist not as amoral as he thinks he is Jay makes the mistake of falling hard for Natasha (Barbara Mori) the fiancee of a spoiled young Sin City prince of crime setting up an impossibly beautiful lovers-on-the-run scenario that director Anurag Basu shoots like a series of windswept fashion videos. Even with the lights of the Vegas Strip forming a gauzy halo behind his tousled head Roshan is a master at low-keying his enormous charm and shrugging off his blinding handsomeness. Mori a Mexican telenovela star is almost a match for him Shes a dead ringer for Megan Fox but warmer less calculating in her sexiness. Not even the incoherent mishmash of plot (mostly faux Leone by way of Tarantino and Rodriguez with periodic car-flipping chase sequences) can entirely dim the appeal of this match-up between a blue-eyed Punjabi and a blue-eyed Mexican of almost equal comeliness. Kites will be released Stateside both in this original 130-minute subtitled version and in a shorter dubbed ""remix"" prepared by noted Bollywood aficionado Brett Ratner. You have been warned. (David Chute) (Beverly Center Culver Plaza Fallbrook)PRINCE OF PERSIA THE SANDS OF TIME Prince of Persia The Sands of Times story hinges on a dagger that can rewind time a narrative conceit that doubles as a taunt to those who endure this cacophonous frivolous adaptation of Ubisofts Arabian Nights-themed video-game series. Bruckheimered to the hilt with the same rollicking period-piece cheesiness that typified the producers (and studio Disneys) Pirates of the Caribbean franchise this Aladdin-indebted summer spectacle charts the efforts of noble prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) to clear his name after hes fingered for his fathers assassination a mission aided by a feisty princess (Clash of the Titans beauty Gemma Arterton) and a magic blade that fueled by divine sand gives those who wield it the ability to travel one minute back in time. Though too sweet and amicable a presence to radiate genuine ass-kicking machismo Gyllenhaal carries out his heros parkour derring-do with proficiency but director Mike Newell is ill-suited to steward such sword-and-sandals adventure. Bogged down by more leaden ripped-from-the-headlines allusions than this flippant fable can withstand most courtesy of a hammy Alfred Molina its merely a cash-my-paycheck-dammit film embodied by a disinterested Sir Ben Kingsley whose bald head and jet-black goatee position his stodgy scoundrel as a mini-me Ming the Merciless. (Nick Schager) (Citywide)SEX AND THE CITY 2 Sarah Jessica Parker is now 45 years old and frankly I cannot stomach another moment of the simpering mincing hair-tossing eyelash-batting little-girl shtick shes been pulling ever since L.A. Story. While her BFFs struggle on with work-life challenges (Miranda) child-care dilemmas (Charlotte) and cougar body maintenance (Samantha) Carrie Bradshaw carries the movies big-ticket question How do you hang on to your marital bling once the newlywed bliss is over especially if you dont want children and your husband has turned into a homebody? Why talk it to death in ever-decreasing circles of inconsequential angst then head for Abu Dhabi. There await the four Fs -- fashion food furnishings and fornication -- plus scads of cringe-making Middle Eastern stereotypes wrapped in a nominal shout-out to oppressed Arab women who guess what like Versace and suffer from hot flashes just like us. Having raked in 400 million for the first SATC Michael Patrick King can write his own ticket which may explain why SATC2 runs a crushing 146 minutes of not very funny gag lines wrapped in episodic miniscenes that generate more embarrassment than sympathy. I get that ""dignity be damned"" is some kind of feminist mantra for King. But its one thing to create pop icons as beloved as Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern were in the late 1970s. Its quite another to drag them well into middle age dress them like mutton passing as lamb and lumber them with female troubles culled straight from the mommy and single-lady blogs.

Sep. 10 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On CBS Tickets Mon. Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm SHREK FOREVER AFTER In this fourth and final installation in the Shrek franchise our green hero feels emasculated by the grind of domesticity (marriage fatherhood) and worn down by the demands of celebrity. His failure to realize that his is indeed a wonderful life leads him to utter a wish for just one day to cavort in his old life of swampy bachelorhood. The wish is granted by the conniving Rumpelstiltskin whose enforcement of contractual fine-print lands Shrek in a brutal parallel universe in which Rumpelstiltskin rules the kingdom of Far Far Away with an army of witches as his muscle. There Fiona (in Xena mode) leads an underground resistance movement Donkey has no memory of Shrek but still steals almost every scene hes in and an obese Puss walks away with whatever scenes Donkey doesnt. It takes the film a deadly long time to kick in and when it does it largely retreads formula ironic use of pop standards musical numbers with contemporary choreography played for maximum laughs risque one-liners. By the middle of the second act Forever After finally finds its groove becoming mildly amusing (the actors -- Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Antonio Banderas -- are in fine form) but never rising to the inspired heights of the original. And the 3-D effects are so weak as to bring nothing to the table. (Ernest Hardy) (Citywide)SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD The sixth installment in George A. Romeros long-running horror serial (est. 1967) follows Sarge Crockett (Alan Van Sprang) as he leads his gone-rogue unit of National Guardsmen from the zombie-pestilent mainland to ""Plum Island Delaware."" There the returned departed are feuded over by two family-armies led by Irish patriarchs. Once ashore the island seemingly preserved in the 1880s Romero piles on plotlines and Western tropes six-shooters an Anthony Mann Oedipal ranch hand a bona fide scalping and a homo-flirty mentor-student rapport between Van Sprang and Devon Bostick an orphaned teen he picked up. Bosticks character allows 70-year-old Romero to continue his uncomprehending fascination with gadget-addicted Millennials talking about things ""on the Net"" which made Diary of the Dead excruciating assurance that Survival could only possibly be the second-worst Dead movie. Romeros own embrace of new technology includes silly CGI violence like a noggin blown clean away leaving the scalp to plop on the neck stump or zombie eyeballs sproinging out of sockets like novelty glasses. The script reunites the writer-directors familiar preoccupations with the family-as-hell creeping Catholicism and stock rednecks. The inevitable all-you-can-eat orgy of zombies pulling stringy mouthfuls away from red wet rib cages may satisfy gorehounds but big set pieces showing how atrophied Romeros cutting and tactical framing have become is depressing to anyone who has valued his films for more than just splatter.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 30 2010 Save for later Saved Gemma Arterton right and Jake Gyllenhaal are shown in a scene from Prince of Persia The Sands of Time. Andrew Cooper/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If you approach the new Jerry Bruckheimer video-game-derived popcorn extravaganza ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" as well a great big video game - or even better a psychedelic romp - youll emerge reasonably intact. Something is going on all the time even if that something is oftentimes clumsy nonsensical or flat. But the sheer whoosh of the story line keeps you watching anyway and as the prince Jake Gyllenhaal has a hearty good-naturedness that comes as a relief amid all the turbocharged antics. He wears his heroism lightly.This is no small feat in a movie that is always threatening to bury him in a mountain of special and not-so-special effects. Director Mike Newell and his team of writers are trying for that patented Bruckheimer scary-funny vibe a la ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" They dont quite bring it off but then neither did any of the ""Pirates"" sequels either.Ancient Persia comes in for some not-so-ancient revamping here. The Persian Army has invaded the city of Alamut because the Alamutians are smuggling swords to Persias enemies. Except theyre not. The films chief bad guy has concocted this lie as a pretext for invasion. Newell and company dont press the parallels with Iraq but they stick out anyway. In just a few years weve gone from war-torn Iraq-themed dramas and documentaries to - this. It doesnt take long for popular culture to cartoonize cataclysms. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The prince mistakenly accused of killing his father is partnered for most of the movie with Alamuts Princess Tamina played by Gemma Arterton in a state of perpetual pout. They - and for a time just about everybody else in the movie - are in possession of a magic dagger that can turn back time for one minute. Kind of like an ancient rewind button. One might be tempted to hit fast forward instead though not during the scenes involving Alfred Molina who brings some levity to the proceedings as an ostrich-racing sheikh. As the Persian kings brother Nizam Ben Kingsley does his best not to let his eyeliner upstage him. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action.)

Comments Prince of Persia The Sands of Time Free Video Rated PG-13  116 minutes  2010 Disney and megaproducer Jerry Bruckheimer whose partnership has yielded the National Treasure and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises churn out another disposable family entertainment with this screen adaptation of a sword-and-sorcery video game. When the Persian monarch is assassinated with a poisoned robe the finger of guilt falls on his adopted son (Jake Gyllenhaal) and a maharajahs captured daughter (Gemma Arterton); much swashbuckling adventure ensues the big gimmick of which is a magical dagger that can turn back time.

amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Prince of Persia the Sands of Time amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Supernova A Tyrants Tale >> Prince of Persia the Sands of Time Bring a joystick to this big budget adventure. Itll give your hands something to do when youre restless. Inspired by a video game and directed (by Mike Newell) like a video game Prince of Persia is a study in synthetic synergy. Jake Gyllenhaal--broad and broody like a muscle-bound Jordan Catalano--scrambles and leaps like his legs are made of pixels. Gemma Arterton--a brave beautiful actress--is here just a pretty face with the blankness of a bot. Like the villagers in Link shes designed to parrot plot points. Hollywood used her well as the brassy doomed Strawberry Fields in Quantum of Solace but has routed her to the blockbuster ghetto where in Clash of the Titans and here she struggles in vain to make an impression. The stars of this story about a prince falsely accused of murdering his father are Gyllenhaal Arterton and Ben Kingsley as the brother of the fallen king. But the only talents I remembered in the light of the lobby were the racing ostriches raised by Sheik Alfred Molina. Mighty of limb long of eyelash and utterly undazzled by the spectacle around them these big birds stalk around the screen like Jerry Bruckheimer aint nothing but a sucka. Maybe if everyone else behind in the film had also not given a hiss about ticket sales and sequel potential they could have made a movie interesting enough to watch. But this is safe and handsome and utterly dull a conduit for sales of video games and popcorn a gateway drug to summers (hopefully) better pleasures.

When we last encountered Mike Newell he was directing -- that is blandly anglicizing -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez Love in the Time of Cholera. And now their latest venture Prince of Persia The Sands of Time a spectacularly silly video-game adaptation about a Fresh Prince of Gel Hair who runs around the desert with a magic dagger a curious version of Alfred Molina and some hoity-toity chick who never breaks a sweat. Its sort of pointless. I use ""sort of"" because the film functions well enough as an empty-headed expenditure of time and turbans and because Im always happy to watch attractive people flare their nostrils for two hours at a stretch. The thespian excitement doesnt stop at nostrils Actors also furrow brows goggle eyes and screech out names in mortal peril. The name that gets screeched most often is Dastan Gyllenhaals sixth-century hero an orphan who was plucked off the streets by the good King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup). In a series of events that dont bear repeating Dastan ends up in possession of a super-special mucho-mystical dagger equipped with ""the sands of time"" allowing him to turn back the clock for a little strategic redo. Neat doohickey. His evil uncle (Ben Kingsley) wants it too. So does comely Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) the non-perspirer who joins Dastan on a quest to protect the sands fend off evil and prevent some kind of dust-spewing apocalyptic maelstrom launched by angry gods. Prince of Persiawas adapted from Jordan Mechners popular game (which I attempted once but gave up when I kept impaling Dastan on floor spikes) by Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard two of the five writers involved with Disneys upcomingThe Sorcerers Apprentice plus Boaz Yakin whose resumeincludesDirty Dancing Havana Nights and a Dolph Lundgren movie. Mechner himself had a hand in the story if thats what it is. Mostly it plays like progressive levels in a video game Dastan aided by CGI bounds over the walls of a city. Dastan tippy-toes past cavernous sinkholes. Dastan copes with poisonous snakes and whirling-dervish assassins. Dastan outwits Amar (Molina) a farcical sheik who makes his livin off ostrich races. Through it all Gyllenhaal pops those big baby blues (like his video progenitors) and employs a not-bad British accent perhaps in homage to Peter OToole. Along with The Mummy Aladdin Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Book of Exodus Lawrence of Arabia gets ripped off I mean referenced quite a bit. At various points I thought I heard strains of Maurice Jarres iconic Arabia orchestral theme although not the points that sounded like Scarborough Fair on steroids. Then again this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production; it has every business being steroidal. As a game adaptation it has every business being jumpy and sequential and as a frivolous summer popcorn flick it has every business being inane.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 28 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Prince of Persia The Sands of Time Directed by Mike Newell Written by Boaz Yakin Doug Miro Carlo Bernard Starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton Classification PG Actors are all prisoners of their appearance and Jake Gyllenhaal is more shackled than most. A handsome fellow no doubt but with those soft features and dewy eyes hes just not an action hero let alone an action hero in a costume drama set deep in the dunes of ancient times. Sorry but the guy cant credibly play a Persian prince - a Persian cat maybe. Dont get me wrong. When it comes to blockbuster flicks based on best-selling video games Im willing to allow for a little wiggle room in the verisimilitude department. So if a miscast Jake was the only fly in this epic ointment we might still have had ourselves a picture. Alas he isnt and we dont. Fly No. 2 is director Mike Newell who likes to fancy himself a jack-of-all-genres boasting a resume that zigzags from Four Weddings and a Funeral through Donnie Brasco to a segment of the Harry Potter franchise. But Newell has never been a fast hand with the camera and here when the script calls for kinetic he pulls up lame. Proof isnt long in arriving. Just a few frames in the walled city of Alamut must be stormed and sacked. Well cue the usual tepid arsenal of distracting close-ups visual clutter and cheesy CGI. Cue too the glaze already starting to form over our blase eyes - been there seen that. Of course leading the attack is Dastan (Gyllenhaal) who you should know is not a prince by birth. Plucked off the mean streets by the King and raised in the court hes an adopted royal undeniably noble in character but not blue of blood thereby inviting some jealous enmity from the monarchs natural-born sons. Aint it always the way. Indeed in another nod to timeless happenings the city got invaded under false pretences - turns out that it wasnt secretly harbouring any of those pernicious catapulting WMDs. More happily it does house the beauteous Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) and as luck would have it the ""sands of time"" - to be precise a glass-handled dagger with a red button that when pushed reverses times flow and permits its lucky owner the luxury of a ""do-over."" In a video game this is a handy device; in a movie its a world-beater and thus good and evil alike are vying for possession. So the teams form up with naturally our dewy Prince and the spunky Princess on the side of the angels. Together they venture forth to do battle with sandstorms and snakes and a wicked band of knife-savvy assassins and dont forget Ben Kingsley. In keeping with the general mood of B-movie serials theres even a cliff to hang from along with occasional pauses for comic refreshment interludes where the hero banters and ostriches cavort. Or is it the reverse? Anyway whenever the corner gets lethally tight the good guys just grab that time-shifting dagger hustle back a few minutes and stage a different outcome. Feels like cheating to me but then again Im not much of a gamer. But back to Jake. To his credit portraying a character unblessed with superpowers but apparently well-schooled in the ancient Persian art of video-game ""parkour"" he clambers up walls and jumps across rooftops convincingly well. What proves more daunting to him is the sound barrier the aural convention dictating that the denizens of our classic past like the Greeks and the Romans and now the Persians too all speak the Kings English with a pronounced British accent. An American to the tip of his tongue Jake tries valiantly to pitch his speech somewhere in the mid-Atlantic range but his efforts are faint and fleeting and by my reckoning barely get him out of territorial waters (although its plenty deep enough to drown his performance). Yet spare him any pity. As Dastan is prone to say ""We make our own destiny."" If so Prince of Persia is destined to disappear into the quicksand of time too innocuous to be hated too bland to be remembered just awaiting some bright optimist in a distant future to press the do-over button.

Thursday ""Sex and the City 2"" touched down in Abu Dhabi. Today ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" transports moviegoers to an era when the title country was a vast empire of might but also of wisdom. Directed at a brisk clip by Mike Newell its a sword-clattering affair brimming with betrayals and featuring one tough damsel tasked with saving the world from distress. The tale begins on a dusty street as King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) recognizes something worthy in orphan Dastan. He makes the boy his youngest son. Next time we see him the grown-up Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a likeable ruffian in the company of brothers Tus and Garsiv. Ben Kingsley wearing heavy eyeliner portrays Nizam their trusted uncle. Gyllenhaals name rides above the movies title. And in his embodiment of his character that placement turns out to be a deserved recognition of something marquee-quality about the guy. Beneath Dastans scruff lies a ready grin that can flash into a smile and then return to something more delicate. Hes muscular and offhandedly warm. Dastan has discovered the fine art of Parkour eons before the French. He scales walls and hurtles over objects with finesse. Gemma Arterton portrays Tamina the princess of the sacred city that Tus (Richard Coyle) Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Dastan attack (they believe it has been selling weapons to Persias enemies.) Tamina is guardian of a supernatural dagger that under the right -- or very wrong circumstances -- can turn back time. (Take note Cher.) ""Prince of Persia"" is based on the well-reviewed multiplatform video game created by Jordan Mechner. If ""Prince"" producer Jerry Bruckheimer and his longtime associates could make a Disneyland ride into a blockbuster franchise called ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a repurposed video game hardly seems like a challenge. There are action sequences that suggest the kind of obstacles video game players are often required to surmount. A fun bit has Dastan grabbing onto arrows one by one in order to breach a fortress wall. But the nods to gamers and special effects -- sand whipping sand golden sand -- dont bury the story. Theres a dash of ""Gladiator"" thrown into this stew. Before his end Sharaman speaks of goodness versus greatness and celebrates the kinship forged by ethics over blood. Accused of a dastardly crime Dastan flees with Tamina. Naturally they make uneasy allies. She wants the dagger; he has it. She regains the knife; he wants it. The dagger passes between them enough times to fuel a graduate thesis on phallic symbolism. Any doubts? Well one switcheroo involves finding a nutcracker in place of the dagger. The films initials spell ""P.o.P"" And Newell goes about its popcorn ambitions with old-fashioned relish. Far superior to the recent ""Clash of the Titans"" redux ""Prince of Persia"" is Saturday-matinee fare done as if such a thing still existed. Its not a classic but its sturdy enough thanks to Gyllenhaal and a sly and grousing turn by Alfred Molina as Sheikh Amar a scoundrel with a heart of gold -- or at least a ticker very interested in riches. His right-hand man an African knife thrower named Seso (Steve Toussaint) provides a rousing faceoff with a spike- wielding assassin. Rated PG-13 ""Prince"" has slashing and piercing action but few blood mists. At the end of the adventure there are no big surprises. Instead there are the reassuring payoffs of the genre. There will be comeuppance sacrifice and maybe even a long embrace. In a film about destiny (foretold or self-made) one thing seems clear Like his character Gyllenhaal is well on his way to bigger even better roles. Its just a matter of time.

The dusty Moroccan landscape is a character in itself enhanced in the battle scenes with hundreds of extras.Directed by Mike Newell whose career has ranged from Four Weddings and a Funeral to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire the movie stars Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain Donny Darko ) as the heroic title character Dastan adopted offspring of the Persian king Sharaman (Ronald Pickup). Movie Information Prince of Persia The Sands of TimeRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Mike NewellStarring Jake Gyllenhaal Gemma Arteron Ben Kingsley and Alfred MolinaRun time 113 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (intense violence and action)Synopsis A ""rogue prince"" and a princess race against time and evil.More movies from GuideLive.comConflict is sown when the king and his biological sons (Richard Coyle and Reese Ritchie) receive word that rulers of the holy city of Alamut may be aiding the kingdoms enemies. There they find feisty Princess Tamina (Gemma Arteron) who reluctantly agrees to marry Dastan as a settlement but not before calling the invaders ""a horde of camel-riding illiterates.""That kind of humor plays a big role in Prince especially after the introduction of Alfred Molina as a tax-hating businessman running a desert gambling operation around ostrich races. The salty entrepreneur might as well be a member of the tea party.It takes about an hour for the story to kick in during which the audience is treated to half a dozen action scenes that include the nifty trick of wall climbing. When the king dies after donning a poisonous robe Dastan is fingered as the killer and he and Tamina set out to find the real culprit.What everyone is after whether they know it or not is the Dagger of Time a god-created sword that gives its bearer the power to go back in time and alter historical events. When its power is unleashed the sword engulfs whoever is holding it in plumes of lava-colored light.The second hour of Prince turns into a suspense thriller. Who had the most to gain by killing the king and controlling the dagger?

ABOUT THE MOVIEPrince of Persia The Sands of Time  out of fourStars Jake Gyllenhaal Ben Kingsley Gemma Arterton Alfred MolinaDirector Mike NewellDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and actionRunning time 1 hour 56 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Prince of Persia The Sands of Time transcends its origins as a video game but just barely. Its not the grand scale action-adventure it aspires to be but this faux epic does offer family-friendly entertainment. The swashbuckling premise recalls Aladdin Arabian Nights and the Indiana Jones movies though a more pallid less memorable version. An early scene in a Middle Eastern bazaar particularly brings to mind Disneys Aladdin. But alas theres no singing genie to lighten things up. TRAILER Preview Persia SUMMER MOVIE CALENDAR Click around and learn about the seasons biggest films A long-haired ripped Jake Gyllenhaal plays the eponymous hero and proves himself a worthy action star. Likable and less old-school macho he convincingly pulls off athletic leaps dashing swordplay and acts of derring-do. The production design has a rich voluptuous look. But the story is overwrought getting bogged down in exposition as it blends magic myth and mayhem. Heavy on action and light on character development it has the trademark Jerry Bruckheimer production formula similar to the last two Pirates of the Caribbean installments. Gyllenhaal plays a former street urchin in medieval Persia adopted by King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup). As the king predicted Dastan grows into a noble and muscular man a loyal son and caring brother. The story follows the exploits of Dastan mistakenly accused of murdering his royal father. His mission is to find the real culprit though the identity of the assassin seems crystal-clear to those watching. Along the way Dastan stumbles on a magic dagger and joins forces with the sassy Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) of the kingdom he has just attacked. Theres an undercurrent of romantic tension between Dastan and Tamina mostly evident in relentless teasing and one big smooch. In a politically tinged angle presumably aimed at parents in the audience Taminas kingdom is wrongly believed to be creating weapons capable of destroying the world. Sound familiar? The story unfolds with little regard for subtlety and wisecracks are what pass for humor. When a gaggle of gangly ostriches offers one of the biggest laughs wit clearly is at a premium. Alfred Molina the main human source of humor plays Sheik Amar an ostrich-racing entrepreneur who repeatedly refers to himself as a ""small-business owner"" and complains about taxes. Another stab at timeliness? The titular ""sands of time"" are a gift from the gods hidden within the daggers hilt. Since those grains have the mystical power to rewind time the blade is one hot commodity -- chased after by a slew of nefarious types. Sir Ben Kingsley in eye makeup black goatee and shaved head goes through villainous motions as Dastans dastardly uncle Nizam. Director Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) fails to inject a magical quality to the story but he does have a way with elaborate spectacle and sweeping landscapes. In the end despite a few entertaining scenes this tale of swords sandals and supernatural sands is too unimaginative to sweep us away.

Now ""Sex and the City 2"" reveals what Islamic women want. Call this sequel callow garish ghastly grisly or grotesque--and it is all of those things plus borderline-interminable at 146 minutes. During a visit to Abu Dhabi though Carrie Samantha Miranda and Charlotte discover that the chadors worn by their Muslim sisters conceal--you guessed it--the glories of this years fashion collection. So much for a clash of civilizations. In this sequel to ""Sex and the City"" Carrie Bradshaw and the gang travel to Abu Dhabi. This dismal comedy provokes a crash of expectations however modest they may have been after the first theatrical version of the HBO series. Its a silly symphony of big anxious smiles and big nervous laughs. (In a film for the cognitively challenged everything but the tacky wardrobe is several sizes too big.) Its a cinematic dairy farm milking every close-up and every gag whether about menopause (the four friends are forever young only in reruns) or about a glamorous Irish nannys bouncy breasts. Its an almost avant-garde adventure in aimlessness. Apart from an elaborately cloying gay wedding nothing happens until somewhere near the half-hour mark when Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her beloved Mr. Big (Chris Noth) come up against a certifiable conflict--he wants to stay home and she doesnt. Thats when ""Sex and the City 2"" also becomes a triumph of product placement the product being Abu Dhabi (though what we see is actually Morocco). ""Dubai is over"" a dubious sheik declares. ""Abu Dhabi is the future."" ENLARGE From left Cynthia Nixon Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis in Sex and the City 2. New Line Productions Maybe so but it looks like the past--specifically a Bob Hope and Bing Crosby road movie with Kim Cattralls Samantha as a nymphomaniacal (and she never lets us forget menopausal) stand-in for Dorothy Lamour. Samantha manages to scandalize her Muslim hosts with carnality in public places while Carrie has a flirtation with having a flirtation after an encounter with an old flame that plays--and looks--like a potboiler produced by Ross Hunter. The production as a whole which was perpetrated as before by Michael Patrick King turns on a strategy of avoidance. Real feelings lurk just below the surface--Samanthas terror of growing old Carries fear of eventual tedium in a childless marriage. Yet the surface is where the movie stays like an old submarine with dead batteries. Father of My Children Im reluctant to tell you too much about ""Father of My Children."" Surprises abound and one of the events in its narrative flow left me so stunned that I wished the flow would stop until I could pull myself together. It isnt saying too much though to call Mia Hansen-Loves French-language drama beautiful profound and given the gathering tensions of its story phenomenally full of life. The father of the title Gregoire Canvel is an idealistic movie producer under siege. (Let me stop my own account long enough to note that this is more than a movie about making movies even though the details of Gregoires working life are rendered with precision and delightful verve.) One of his self-styled auteurs is out of control along with the movies budget and someone on the set has recently committed suicide. Gregoires credit line is frayed to the point of unraveling. He fields cell phone calls like a goalie fending off swarms of free kicks. And his little indie operation is about to be invaded by a small army of Korean filmmakers wholl need logistical support that the office staff cant provide. In the midst of this steady-state chaos Gregoire manages to stay cool radiate charm and keep his wry sense of humor. Hes also wise enough to set aside precious time for his Italian-born wife Sylvia (Chiara Caselli) and their three lovely daughters one of whom is on the cusp of young womanhood. Still watching Gregoire in action starts you wondering how long he can survive both financially and emotionally and how much of his devotion to the cause of his independent films is sustained by denial or self-delusion. Such questions arise without any prompting from Ms. Hansen-Love who writes and directs with flawless finesse or from the casual virtuoso who plays Gregoire. Louis-Do de Lencquesaing gives a performance of understated brilliance one that keeps our feelings about his character in constant flux. Thats a quietly daring approach to acting. Sometimes we can see Gregoire as the ardent young man he once was. At other times its easy to imagine the stressed-out ruin he could become. Occasionally both men seem to exist simultaneously. The filmmakers quiet daring suffuses her view of the whole family. Instead of sticking to predictable drama--the sweet-and-sour smell of success--she turns her attention halfway through to the heros wife and daughters. (I kept hoping wed see more of their oldest girl Clemence whos played exquisitely by Mr. de Lencquesaings own daughter Alice and those hopes were amply rewarded; watch what she does for example with a simple scene about deciding which coffee to order in a cafe.) The films focus comes to be not only the price Gregoires loving family pays for his principled obsession but how they cope with the realization that their life has been built on quicksand. The choice of a closing song is deliciously daring and the cinematography by Pascal Auffray is sharp-eyed and radiant as befits a movie concerned with the movie business. ENLARGE Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton in Prince of Persia The Sands of Time. Disney Prince of Persia The Sands of Time For those of you--of us--whove been rooting for Jake Gyllenhaal to prevail as a romantic hunk in ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" the news is pretty good. He may not be another Douglas Fairbanks or Burt Lancaster but his dashing Dastan drives this action adventure which was directed by Mike Newell with a sense of fun that was missing from ""Robin Hood"" and a winning demeanor that encompasses light irony and poetic melancholy not to mention an earnest but slightly bizarre English accent. Whats more he finds a princess worthy of him in Gemma Arterton who comes by her accent honestly. Shes as English as say Vivien Leigh on whose Cleopatra her fiery character may have been modeled and she complements him perfectly in a succession of scorpions-in-a-bottle scenes that have been written and are performed with genuine elegance. (The princess Tamina goes through almost the whole film in a single and elegant white gown.) The film looks impressive thanks to the burnished gold tones of John Seales cinematography and to the artful employment of digital technology that yields dreamlike evocations of medieval desert vistas. And theres much to enjoy in the flash and clash of some early battles as well as the comical counterpoint of an ostrich race staged by a scruffy hustler who calls himself Sheik Amar; hes played with engaging gusto by Alfred Molina. Yet ""Prince of Persia"" a movie born of a video game is at war with itself and the bad guys win. Theyre the ones responsible for the plot which is a junkyard of Arabian Nights cliches; for the numbing action sequences that feel like identical segments of an endless loop; and for a climax of boundless absurdity. The lesson here is simple In the digital realm the bigger the worse. What looks distinctive and believable in short takes and small doses can turn blatantly phony and deadly familiar when the scale is pumped up. ""Prince of Persia"" pumps itself up to the bursting point and bursts. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Road to Morocco (1942) The film wasnt shot in Abu Dhabi but then it wasnt shot in Morocco either. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby are Orville ""Turkey"" Jackson and Jeff Peters stowaways who find themselves castaways following a shipwreck off Paramounts version of the Moroccan coast. When Jeff sells Orville into slavery the slave owner turns out to be a nubile princess played by Dorothy Lamour. As scholarly depictions of Arab culture go ""Road to Morocco"" is on a par with ""Sex and the City 2."" But its a lot more fun and won an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. ENLARGE Summer Hours (2008) Mia Hansen-Loves previous film isnt available in a DVD format that will play on American players. Instead Ive chosen this fine French-language drama by Olivier Assayas because it offers the chance to see Alice de Lencquesaing in another small but important role. She plays the dying matriarchs teenage granddaughter Sylvie who remembers her grandmas history of love and grand passion and may be destined to repeat it. The film is ostensibly about material things but the filmmakers concern is what the matriarchs objects of art are really worth--their emotional content rather than their market value. ENLARGE Brokeback Mountain (2005) Jake Gyllenhaal and the late Heath Ledger play American cowboys. Mr. Gyllenhaals Jack is a mercurial mix of plain poetic and practical. Mr. Ledgers Ennis is touchingly bleak and self-contained except when rages sweep him. Although the two men love each other passionately they cant live together in the Marlboro Country of the 1960s and 70s so they try to hide their love behind shaky facades of heterosexual domesticity. Ang Lee directed from a superb adaptation of an Annie Proulx short story by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana. With Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams as respectively Jacks and Enniss uncomprehending wives. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Movie review Jake Gyllenhaals Prince of Persia The Sands of Time washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments Prince of Persia The Sands of Time Movie review Jake Gyllenhaals Prince of Persia The Sands of Time Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 28 2010 With the greasy unkempt hair of an emo rocker and a Bart Simpson smirk Jake Gyllenhaal goes swinging leaping slashing and joking his way through ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" an energetic if empty-headed adventure based on the popular video game. Though set in a sea of sand thats supposed to be ancient Persia the movie features a titular hero whose anachronistic catchphrases -- ""That all ya got?"" and ""Whoa"" uttered in an incongruous Cockney accent -- makes him sound less like a Middle Eastern prince than an East End pothead. This StoryPrince of Persia The Sands of Time Welcome to the Jake Gyllenhaal stunt showFind Prince of Persia showtimesWatch the trailer The focus of Prince Dastans acrobatic exertions which careen from ninja-like moves to the wall-bouncing gymnastics of parkour is a special dagger he has stumbled upon. When a jewel is pressed on its hilt releasing the few thimblefuls of sand inside it has the ability to rewind time but only for one minute. Its like Adam Sandlers magical remote control in ""Click"" but with a weak battery. When you run out of sand you run out of power. Not just any sand will work either. Hidden underground is a giant glass vessel filled with the right kind. Only the dagger can break the glass. Once broken the sand inside will flow through the knifes handle giving its user virtually unlimited ability to travel backward in time. One more thing If all the sand is used up the world will end. The other problem is that Dastans not the only one who knows about it. Someone else wants it -- most likely Dastans brother Tus (Richard Coyle) or his uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) -- and has set Dastan up for the murder of his adoptive father King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup). Dastan you see is not of royal blood so he makes a logical suspect. (It might also explain the low-class accent and his aversion to shampoo.) Whoever really killed Sharaman wants Dastan out of the way so that he can find the source of the charmed sand himself and you know exert dominion over the blah blah blah. With the assistance of the daggers official custodian Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) Dastan must stop that from happening. Along the way he and Tamina -- a spirited tart-tongued womens libber in a country not known for gender equality -- engage in predictable verbal sparring even as they dodge arrows flying knives snakes and hired assassins (called preposterously Hassansins). As in a video game each obstacle or level of challenge they encounter is progressively more difficult. But this is a movie were watching here. Although ""Prince of Persia"" stimulates the circulatory and nervous systems it engages none of the higher faculties of game play. Like say hand-eye coordination and map-reading skills. Its a frenetic yet passive experience. There are however a few distinct pleasures. The stunt work is consistently exciting and well filmed by director Mike Newell. And the character of Seso (Steve Toussaint) -- a Sudanese knife thrower with almost no dialogue who at first appears to be a very bad guy and then turns out to be a very good one -- makes a welcome presence. I wish I could say the same about Sesos boss Sheik Amar a bandit who befriends Dastan and Tamina and aids them in their quest. Played with the broadest of broad humor by Alfred Molina hes clearly meant as comic relief. But from what? Does a movie this silly really need two clowns? Every sly wink and gymnastic tumble from Gyllenhaals Dastan who already looks and acts like a refugee from Cirque du Soleil seems to suggest otherwise. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Welcome to the Jake Gyllenhaal stunt show Find Prince of Persia showtimes Watch the trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/27/AR2010052701688.html,200,princeofpersiathesandsoftime12,princeofpersiathesandsoftime,washingtonpost

Disney and its resident mega-producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Pirates of the Caribbean"") neednt have bothered. Id wager not many people are going to remember much of this corny highly derivative would-be franchise inspired by a video game even if it carries a reported 200 million price tag. Although ""Prince of Persia"" seems aimed at 10-year-olds it will be tolerable for older folks because of its more amusing aspects. Chief among them is surely the casting of erstwhile emo boy Jake Gyllenhaal -- arms pumped out to there and sporting a posh Oxbridge accent -- in the title role. To paraphrase ""Brokeback Mountain"" perhaps that movies star thought this turn in a blockbuster would ""complete"" him. Jakes Prince Dastan is a former street urchin adopted by the wise old king and raised alongside the kings two other sons. Climbing up on arrows that miraculously pierce stone walls Dastan leads the charge on a religious city. Dastan and his brothers have been misled to believe its hiding the ancient equivalent of weapons of mass destruction (some things apparently never change in the Middle East). Dastan does discover the aforementioned dagger -- complete with a jewel in the hilt that functions like a video-game controller -- along the beautiful and feisty Princess Tamina (recent James Bond girl Gemma Arterton as hilariously inauthentic as Gyllenhaal). Its hate at first site on her part but that doesnt stop Tamina from spiriting Dastan out of the city when hes blamed by his brothers for a wardrobe malfunction -- straight out of a 50s B-movie -- that kills their father. Even for a summer blockbuster this committee-written effort is notoriously weak in the logic department. Its not really giving away much to report that Dastans eyeliner-lovin uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) has his own nonsensical plans for the magic dagger. Tamina meanwhile has for some reason been waiting around for Dastans arrival to ""fulfill my destiny"" -- (I believe she also uses the term ""it is written"") -- and prevent the dagger from being used to inadvertently destroy mankind. Yes its another one of those summer movies. In this case Taminas ""destiny"" essentially leads up to knocking off the climax of ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" with surprisingly cheesy effects that are in no way 28 years better than that classic. Thankfully neither Gyllenhaal nor Arteton take this nonsense any more seriously than absolutely necessary and they almost make you believe they have chemistry together. Anyone expecting much in the way of romance though will be disappointed As I noted this rather chaste movie seems to be aimed at 10-year-olds. Also helping to make this a fairly painless experience is Alfred Molina getting most of the laughs as a gold-toothed bandit who occasionally helps the couple and more notably runs ostrich races in the desert. Veteran director Mike Newell (""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"") offers up some handsome desert vistas and vast sets crammed with meticulously detailed costumes and furniture albeit of dubious authenticity. And he brings it in under two hours no small accomplishment on a typically overproduced Bruckheimer opus. ""Prince of Persia"" got the go-ahead from an administration at Disney that was sent on its way last year. I wouldnt be surprised if their successors at the Mouse House wish they had a magic dagger that would allow them to go back and erase this movie. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Fergie explains it to Oprah Read Next Fergie explains it to Oprah Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 37904 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 19630 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16219 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Prince of Persia The Sands of Time | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time ) Prince of Persia The Sands of Time (United States 2010) May 26 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli In the wake of a successful endeavor to transform a popular Disney theme park attraction (Pirates of the Caribbean) into a motion picture blockbuster uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer has now turned his attention to a well-received video game series Prince of Persia. With Mike Newell at the helm Prince of Persia The Sands of Time is a lively action-oriented romp through ancient lands that bear a suspicious resemblance to the animated environs of Disneys Aladdin. The movie is as fast-paced as it is ultimately pointless - a lot of running around that results in no gain. One of the problems with the injudicious use of time travel is that it provides the screenwriters with ample opportunities to cheat (theres no such thing as writing oneself into a corner) and thats precisely what happens here. Prince of Persia is unsatisfying because of the way it gets to the ending. All of the action and mayhem is designed to distract the viewer from the realization that a lot of what transpires during the course of this movie makes little sense. Basic logic - like the lack of a motive for a key murder - is ignored in favor of keeping the narrative moving. Its on a treadmill but Newell is almost skilled enough to make that not matter until the ""cheat"" occurs and were left feeling that Prince of Persia could have been a lot shorter (not that 109 minutes is too long for a summer movie). Newell also pays homage to the films video game origins. Gamers will find a lot of the jumping climbing swinging and other maneuvers employed by the characters to be familiar. Of course its a lot more fun to play a game than it is to watch one being played and this applies here as well. The story takes place in ancient Persia which is ruled by King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup). He has four trusted advisors his brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley); his eldest son and heir Tus (Richard Coyle); his second son Garsiv (Tony Kebbell); and his adopted son Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal). After the Persian army led by Tus invades a holy city and takes captive the princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton showing more spunk than in the Clash of the Titans remake) Sharaman arrives with words of reprimand. The king decides to betroth Tamina to Dastan but before the proclamation can be made official Sharaman is murdered and suspicion falls upon Dastan. He and Tamina flee uneasy allies in a quest to prove Dastans innocence reveal the true killer and keep a mystical dagger with time-travel powers from falling into corrupt hands. The films marketing campaign is highlighting connections with Pirates of the Caribbean and despite the influence of a different director the look and pacing are not dissimilar although one could as easily compare Prince of Persia with Stephen Sommers The Mummy. However although Jake Gyllenhaal is a competent actor and his scenes with Gemma Arterton set off sparks it doesnt take much searching to identify the missing ingredient Johnny Depp. Pirates of the Caribbean would have been a far less jolly adventure had it focused solely on Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley and thats a little like the dynamic here. While theres plenty of chemistry between Gyllenhaals Darstan and Artertons Tamina (comparable to what exists between Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in The Mummy) the real standout is Alfred Molina hamming it up as a desert entrepreneur who races ostriches and avoids paying taxes. Its a stock character but portrayed with considerable verve although not on Depps level. Ben Kingsley slumming as he is wont to do from time-to-time is entertaining although his portrayal seems uncannily like an audition for Ming the Merciless in a new version of Flash Gordon. Prince of Persia falls into the ever-popular category of summer cinema which was best described by Shakespeare as ""sound and fury signifying nothing."" It looks impressive (all the more so because no one forced a 3-D conversion) and theres never a dull moment. Newell understands the dynamics and rhythm of a big-budget fantasy adventure having already taken the reins for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire so he crafts something eminently watchable. But in large part because of extreme narrative deficiencies its hard to see Prince of Persia as anything more substantive than drive-in fare. With lots of running around and plenty of special effects the only thing missing for the viewer is a game controller and the ability to replay some of the most challenging moves and jumps.

"Prince of Persia These sands flow so slowly | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPrince of Persia These sands flow so slowlyJake Gyllenhaal successfully moves from indie wimp to video game action figure but the hourglass gets jammed by a too-long script.Gemma Arterton as Princess Tamina left and Jake Gyllenhaal are shown in a scene from Prince of Persia The Sands of Time.  (Andrew Cooper / AP)  Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the daring Prince Dastan in Prince of Persia The Sands of Time.  (HANDOUT / MCT)  Ben Kingsley from left Jake Gyllenhaal and Richard Coyle star in Prince of Persia The Sands of Time.  (HANDOUT / MCT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 27 2010Prince of Persia The Sands of Time(out of 4)Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Gemma Arterton Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina. Directed by Mike Newell. At theatres throughout the GTA. Most actors wouldnt thank you for describing them as a video game character.In the instance of Jake Gyllenhaal and his title role in the Prince of Persia The Sands of Time however such comparisons should be taken as a sincere compliment. Its not easy making something so fake seem almost real but Gyllenhaal nails the insincerity finally morphing from indie wimp into blockbuster action figure.Article Continued BelowPrince of Persia isnt just based on a video game as so many films are these days. It blithely acts as if it still is the game which someone managed to project onto a big screen. The camera movements mimic the up-down left-right sweeps of twitchy gamers weapons are constantly in use and the main actors seem impervious to natural laws. Gyllenhaals poor-boy Prince Dastan isnt just a champ at parkour the jumping bean exertions that give the film great energy; hes defies gravity as if hes made of ancient Flubber.Gemma Artertons Princess Tamina the object of much heavy breathing and heroic exertions manages to keep her makeup intact even while treading across the desert and staring into sandstorms. Max Factor are you paying attention?It almost goes without saying that every key cast member has an English accent including the American Gyllenhaal who isnt half bad at it. Theres a rule in productions like these ""If its old-timey you must go Limey.""A pause for station identification the film is directed by Mike Newell who did Donnie Brasco and also one of the Harry Potter pay cheques but its produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and you know what that means. Such trifles as history logic and storytelling must take a back horse to explosions wisecracks and ludicrous situations.This isnt so terrible this time out. Bruckheimer has smartly assembled actors who are fun to watch Gyllenhaal being the big revelation here. He so often plays terminally depressed characters who look like theyd need 10 million volts shot into them just to reach apathy. Hes buffed up and toughened up considerably putting his sleepy-eyed stare and shy grin to good use as a street tough adopted by Persias King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) who must figure he doesnt have enough family rivalry to deal with. Sharaman already has two sons nice guy Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and whiny brute Tus (Richard Coyle) plus he has a suspicious brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley clock punching). They all get along like snakes in a box which is to say you just know that the fangs will come out sooner or later. As with any family the youngest kid is most likely to get blamed so Dastan is forced to take evasive jumping action when treachery most foul erupts and the ""He did it"" fingerpoints are aimed in his direction.The script by Boaz Yakin Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard (based on Jordan Mechners original game ideas) flirts with relevancy in its early going. Sharamans army invades the peaceful city of Alamut home to the hottie Princess Tamina because of bogus intelligence received that the citizens are hiding weapons of mass destruction. Sound familiar? No wonder Nizam reminds me so much of Dick Cheney.The story quickly drifts off to Never Never Land as the mysticism breaks out and the real WMD is revealed. Its a dagger containing genuine ""sands of time"" (yours for 4.99 and two box tops) that can allow the holder to move backwards and forwards through time a handy trick to have when so many knives are being plunged into chests without warning.The dagger also has a red push button on it that can somehow unleash ancient Armageddon or something like that. So much blah-de-blah is expended on describing the daggers powers and what you have to do to control them that I eventually lost track and stopped caring.What is puzzling about the dagger is how cheap it looks like something purchased at the Persian version of a dollar store. How can Bruckheimer spend so much dough on digital pyrotechnics yet turn Scrooge when it comes to real props? Fortunately flesh-and-blood achievements exceed the plastic failures. Alfred Molina makes a welcome addition as a wily entrepreneur who runs ostrich races (those Ben-Hur chariots must cost a bundle) trades in weapons and other contraband and moans constantly about having to pay his city taxes. Take a number bro.Gemma Arterton also impresses in a thankless role that she elevates beyond the damsel-in-distress stereotype. Her Tamina isnt happy about the Persian invasion and shes prepared to make choir boys out of the brutes who did it. Arterton looks like she could have been Megan Foxs understudy for Transformers but she has way more than just a foxy glare and she really clicks with Gyllenhaal.Pity the film doesnt know when to end. At a running time of nearly two hours at least a half-hour too long that blasted toy dagger gets passed around more than a bong at a frat house party. Is there any reason why these sands of time couldnt flow just a little faster?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Disney) Joe Neumaier Thursday May 27 2010 1206 PM Title Prince of Persia The Sands of Time A prince must save a princess and protect a magic dagger. With jake Gyllenhaal Gemma Arterton Ben Kingsley. (155). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.While Sarah Jessica Parker and the ""Sex and the City 2"" gals are swanning through the desert -- and likely collecting the most box office moolah -- this weekend there is another choice although ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" is as barren an adventure flick youll ever unearth.A lot of action flicks are examples of mediocrity but a truly terrible action movie one that shows how not to do things at every turn is a rare thing. Perhaps this was the true destiny of ""P.O.P.""This Jerry Bruckheimer production directed by Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Mona Lisa Smile"" and oh yeah a Harry Potter entry) is an epic example of muddled storytelling chintzy excitement and scatter-brained execution. Despite its ancient-times hero Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) muttering about a mission the movie lacks any momentum or thrills.As a child Dastan was a street urchin plucked by a king to be his adopted third son rough-hewn brother to two true princes. During a raid on a holy city Dastan finds a magic dagger that was stolen from Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) and is sought by the unknown villain who killed the King. Ben Kingleys Nizam despite his goatee and eyeliner and the fact that hes the Kings constantly seething brother is amazingly not a suspect. Jake Gyllenhaal stars in ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time."" (Disney) Dastan is framed for his fathers death but the real reason for the chase is because the dagger has a doohickey on it that when pressed releases mystical ""sand from the gods."" The resulting storm sends the knife-holder back in time for a minute in the dumbest clunkiest bit of mumbo-jumbo since anything in ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider.""That comparison is apt since ""Prince of Persia"" is based on a popular videogame and sets up challenges for Dastan that are essentially get-to-the-next-level obstacle courses (he gets through many with his ability shown in slow-motion to leap like a flying squirrel). Within this world the newly-buff Gyllenhaal is essentially an avatar although his puppy-dog eyes always seem on the verge of tears so maybe he knows hes trapped somewhere he shouldnt be. Kingsley scowls enough for the entire Persian army while Arteron appears to have strolled in from making ""Clash of the Titans"" without even changing her wardrobe.Only Alfred Molina as a tricky sheik seems alive. He plays histax-hating ostrich-racing sidekick role as if this were a Monty Python comedy. The rest of ""Prince of Persia"" is laughable in a different way as we watch characters we dont care about fight unnamed villains with unexplained powers for an artifact were unimpressed by.

By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune May 27 2010 -- 740pm Disney Star Tribune Jake Gyllenhaal in ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" Jake Gyllenhaal Ph Andrew Cooper SMPSP  Disney Enterprises Inc. and Jerry Bruckheimer Inc. All rights reserved. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Prince of Persia"" will inspire filmmakers for years to come. They will watch it and say ""What a mess. I can do better."" ""Prince"" is a pauper of a film. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer who converted a theme-park ride into a winning franchise with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series runs aground with this thunderingly stupid video-game adaptation. Its potential for swashbuckling romance is lost in a sandstorm of hectic uninvolving battle scenes ham-fisted political allegory and witless dialogue. The films strongest connection to its game-console roots is found in action sequences where the hero makes weightless computer-enhanced leaps between buildings more like an animated Peter Pan than a parkour athlete. Jake Gyllenhaal plays high-flying Dastan a former urchin whose courage so impressed the king that he adopted the lad into the royal household. Melding the street life of ""Aladdins"" Agrabah with the royal intrigues of ""The Lion King"" the script gives the benevolent monarch a devious brother (Ben Kingsley whose performance shrieks ""my character is obviously untrustworthy but dont snitch""). Due to some bad intel the kings forces invade a holy city that is said to be supplying arms to Persias enemies. The weapons dont exist (sound familiar?) but there is something better in the chambers of Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton in a performance of pure plywood). Her Highness possesses a mystical dagger with a crystal handle resembling an hourglass. It would be unfair to reveal what magic power the cutlass commands (hint the movies subtitle is ""The Sands of Time"") so lets just say it involves hokey computer-generated visual effects. When hes framed for a dastardly crime Dastan and the haughty princess race across the desert to keep the sacred cutlery out of the wrong hands. Any further attempt at a summary would be futile and exhausting. ""Prince of Persia"" was plotted with a roulette wheel. The basic chain of adventure-film logic -- ""We must get to X before Y because otherwise Z will happen"" -- is ignored in favor of action scenes filmed in JumbleVision and Confuse-O-Rama. The film is very whirling dervish-y and not in a good way. PRINCE OF PERSIATHE SANDS OF TIME  1/2 OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating PG-13 for intense violence and action. Who would have thought that Mike Newell the English filmmaker of such fine efforts as ""Donnie Brasco"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" had a movie as bad as this in him? Not only has he made the film pictorially ugly shooting it in unnatural shades of Cheetos orange but Newell is incompetent at staging swordplay. The camera is pushed so close to the action that you can count the bristles in Gyllenhaals chin stubble or the lashes on his huge doe-like eyes. Other than a duel between knife-throwers in a palace chamber theres no sense of ebb and flow no grasp of the geography just a clanging barrage of scimitars and shields and whips and explosions. Its like having several garbage cans full of lit firecrackers emptied over your head. As an ostrich-racing entrepreneur who jabbers on about tax collectors big government and bureaucrats who make life tough for small-business owners Alfred Molina provides an oasis of comic relief. And if ever a film needed relief this is the one. Watching ""Prince of Persia"" is like being dragged down by quicksand except theres nothing quick about it. By the time this endless film grinds to its increasingly incoherent climax you might be wishing for a dagger that makes time go faster rather than the other way around.

A franchise even.But theres no reason on Earth or anywhere for Prince of Persia 2. Gamers can go back to their sunless lairs and happily toggle their way through new scenarios. Gyllenhaal and Quantum of Solace girl Gemma Arterton will find employment as will Kingsley and Molina. Even the caterers that served the cast and crew as they mucked about Morocco are likely to find other gaffers and grips to nourish.There is a plot or a tangle of them in Prince of Persia Gyllenhaals Dastan is a street urchin grown up amid a royal clan (a prologue shows how the acrobatic brat first ingratiated himself with the king) who must thwart a scheme to seize the Dagger of Time - a weapon with a crystal hilt that contains the supernatural granules of the title. Whoever is in possession of the blade can glimpse into the future thereby gaining the power to change the past and yes control destiny.The only sensible thing to do is take the dagger to the Secret Guardian Temple and pour the sand back into some cosmic hourglass. Which is what Dastan and Princess Tamina (Arterton who also provides the movies drippy voice-over) proceed to do. Each stage along the way in gamer mode presents a new obstacle to surmount a new battle to survive.Needless to say this singular dagger is much sought after. Bring it on Antiques Roadshow and the appraisers would hardly be able to contain themselves.How bad is Prince of Persia? Whether or not director Mike Newell is to blame the action sequences lack verve and scope; they lack in every way.(Newell did the urbane Four Weddings and a Funeral but also a special-effects-laden Harry Potter entry The Goblet of Fire.) Heres this Persian parkour dude swashing his buckles and buckling his swashes everywhere he goes. But his gymnastic gallivanting and the choreographed fights and chases couldnt be more clumsily shot and edited.Ace cinematographer John Seale gets a nice burnished glow but seems to have difficulty keeping pace with Gyllenhaal as he races up castle stairs or rappels down castle walls. Gyllenhaal heretofore known for his eccentric choices and sensitive roles has buffed up mightily and goes shirtless to prove it his long warrior locks blowing in the hot desert breeze.For a moment or two Prince of Persia undergoes an identity crisis becoming a 15-year-old fantasy geeks version of Green Zone. That is the movie suddenly gets all huffy and conspiratorial condemning an invasion and the toppling of a city launched under false pretenses. It turns out that there are no weapons of destruction no proof of insurrection to be found inside the kingdoms walls.The perpetrator of said ruse as it happens is the villain of Prince of Persia he who covets the Dagger of Time. And while it would be SPOILER-ish to reveal his identity it would also be pointless.If you cant see the baddie of Prince of Persia coming from down the dunes and across the oasis then you havent been to the movies in the last hundred years.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time is based on a video game but its roots go further back than that. What would the movies be without enthusiastically corny B-flick swashbucklers to fill theaters on a lazy summer day? All you need are some fancy period sets -- cardboard then CGI now -- a handsome young star declaiming stiff Classics Illustrated dialogue a starlet to bicker and swoon and a respected older actor in need of ready cash as the dastardly prince/vizier/regent. Add sand swordplay a few camels and presto stalwart action product ridiculous but functional.Which is to say that Jake Gyllenhaal as the doughty Prince Dastan is just the latest in a long line of earnest tunic-clad sides of beef. In fact his potted British accent -- this is ancient Persia after all -- can stand with Tony Curtiss Bronx yawp in 1951s ""The Prince Who Was a Thief for sheer what-the-hell period absurdity. But to expect more from a movie that doesnt even take itself very seriously is probably a mistake.For one thing ""Prince of Persia has been stitched together from so many other movies that it plays like an attack of multiple deja vu. Stray bits of ""Star Wars ""Pirates of the Caribbean ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and ""Robin Hood pass by like flotsam and the overwhelming tone is good-natured but alarmingly generic. Youve seen ""Lord of the Rings? Heres the CVS brand.Dastan is the adopted son of Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) king of Persia and please dont spoil things by referring to the countrys modern name (shhh its Iran). A former street urchin hes now a kind-hearted sort given to bare-knuckles bouts with his soldiers while the kings natural sons Tus (Richard Coyle) and Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) busy themselves with expanding the empire. (Those names They sound like the whims of a desperate Scrabble player; you keep expecting a consul named Etaoin Shrdlu to turn up.)Off in the corner plotting evil deeds is the kings brother Nizam. Ben Kingsley appears to have researched this role by studying Max Von Sydows hambone Ming the Merciless in 1980s ""Flash Gordon and truthfully thats probably the only sane approach. Nizam engineers a coup and pins the blame on Dastan who hits the road with only a comely virgin priestess named Tamina (Gemma Arterton) and her glowing dagger for company.Up to now ""Prince of Persia has offered sniggeringly bad dialogue (""Its said the princess of Alamut is a beauty without equal) lots of athletic Iron Age parkour and a pointed subplot about the Persians assault on a holy city in search of weapons of minor destruction -- swords mostly -- that arent there. As Dastan and Tamina get to know each other in their wanderings though the movie loosens up and starts to have fun. The central romance is rehashed Han Solo and Leia but Alfred Molina as a scruffy bandit leader with a stable of racing ostriches gets the funniest lines and knows exactly what to do with them.That glowing dagger turns out to be a time travel device key to Nizams plans and ""Prince of Persia eventually wends its way toward a big noisy Jerry Bruckheimer climax in which Dastan must save the world from turning into a giant catbox. The problem is that all blockbuster apocalypses look pretty much the same by now and this one leans more heavily than it should on the video-game template of getting the hero from point A to point B by solving mazes and such. Gyllenhaal has turned in an acceptably pro performance so far (it consists mostly of keeping a straight face) but even he seems to check out of the proceedings late in the game.""Prince of Persia is truly silly formulaic stuff without an original thought in its over-produced head. No actual Persians were harmed (or even consulted) in its making. So why did I enjoy myself as much as I did? In part by laughing at the movie -- sometimes you take what you can get -- but also because pulp this unembarrassed can have a verve even an innocence thats unusual these days. Its the rare junk that knows its name.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company. Thought you might like ...

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Say this for producer Jerry Bruckheimer He seems to recognize that an assemblage of cutscenes and gameplay simulation from the popular Prince Of Persia videogame series wouldnt make a good movie any more than a theme-park ride like Pirates Of The Caribbean could be the stuff of a mythology-packed three-film seafaring epic. For Prince Of Persia The Sands Of Time Bruckheimer director Mike Newell and their screenwriting team (including game series creator Jordan Mechner) pluck a few basic elements from the game--the scrappy acrobatic hero; the golden-hued 6th-century Persian Empire setting; a magical dagger that allows its user to reverse time; some mystical gobbledygook about special sands that go into the dagger--and fill out the rest with the reliable stock elements of a sword-and-sandal adventure. Spinning a handsome Disney adventure out of a videogame is a testament to Bruckheimers commercial savvy. The fact that it still isnt particularly good seems beside the point. With his wavering British accent and 200 million abs Jake Gyllenhaal is about as authentically Persian as Charlton Heston was a Mexican in Touch Of Evil but he certainly cuts a good figure and cinematographer John Seale who won an Oscar for The English Patient flatters him in every shot. Taken off the streets as a young orphan Gyllenhaal grows up as one of the kings three sons. After he and his brothers lead an invasion of another kingdom under false pretenses--the period equivalent to searching for WMD--and hes exiled for treason Gyllenhaal teams up with a feisty princess (Gemma Arterton) to protect ""The Dagger Of Time"" prevent a world-consuming sandstorm and unmask the man responsible for all this treachery. The chief appeal of the Prince Of Persia platform games is the heros nimble wall-climbing and building-jumping--parkour 15 centuries before it had a name--but beyond a few zippy chase sequences and the time-reversing trick Bruckheimer mostly recasts Pirates Of The Caribbean (with a touch of National Treasure) for another setting. He even brings in Alfred Molina as a loveable rogue of the Captain Jack school. But Prince Of Persia is a thin witless generic adventure with baffling mythology cheesy CGI and a heroine whose regal petulance often recalls Daphne Zuniga in Spaceballs. Give the filmmakers credit for sidestepping the pitfalls of videogame adaptation but getting around the problem isnt the same thing as solving it.

"Prince of Persia Chaotic sort of fun - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 1/2 starsPrince of Persia Chaotic sort of funAlfred Molina provides the zest in this video-game-turned-movieMay 27 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticLike sands through the hourglass these are the days of movies based on video games. ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" which is moderately entertaining chaos dates to the Reagan administration (game creator Jordan Mechner gets executive-producer and story credit). What little story there is however goes out of its way to reference more recent political events. In the opening the Persians invade a holy city to seize weapons of mass destruction (fancy swords mostly) on false pretenses and bad intel. And the movies most engaging character played by a blessedly exuberant Alfred Molina is an ostrich race promoter () who spews anti-government and tax rhetoric straight out of a tea party rally. Molina saves the film from itself. A Disney/Jerry Bruckheimer co-production ""Prince of Persia"" combines the mythic bombast of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" outings with the peppy brainlessness of the ""National Treasure"" films. Working with a credible lower-class-British dialect that great Persian actor Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the grown-up street urchin adopted by the king. Ben Kingsley is his uncle figure and protector (or is he?). Gemma Arterton straight from a barrage of second-rate computer-generated visual effects in ""Clash of the Titans"" plays a young royal trying to keep a magical dagger out of enemy hands. What can the dagger do? It can turn back time and in the wrong hands unleash Armageddon. This is what you the video gamer are trying to prevent from happening. Oh wait. This is the movie version. The viewer has no control over events. The script races from set piece to set piece in the gaming spirit with dialogue on the order of ""OK there are two gates."" Or ""Theyve broken through to the first level of the tunnels"" Director Mike Newell who fared well with the fourth "" Harry Potter"" film is working a little lower down the fantasy chain here and itd be wrong to suggest that ""Prince of Persia"" offers anything like true magic. He keeps the camera rammed close to the action and to the actors faces and the battles have been diced into bits by no fewer than three editors. Plus this may be the most orange movie ever made Working in Morocco and on London soundstages cinematographer John Seales chief inspiration appears to be the heat lamps at Arbys. And yet ... its sort of fun certainly more so than the ""National Treasure"" pictures as well as less manic (a little less) than the recent ""Mummy"" films. Mainly for folks like me it has Molina. His characters zest may be in a broader vein than Peter Ustinovs peerless turn in ""Spartacus."" But Molinas wit enlivens a product you might otherwise forget as it slips in one eye and out the other. MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action) 2 1/2 stars Cast Jake Gyllenhaal (Dastan); Gemma Arterton (Tamina); Ben Kingsley (Nizam); Alfred Molina (Sheiikh Amar) Credits Directed by Mike Newell; written by Boaz Yakin Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard based on the video game created by Jordan Mechner; produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.

"Movie review Prince of Persia The Sands of Time - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie review Prince of Persia The Sands of TimeJake Gyllenhaal is never quite right as Dastan but Gemma Arterton Alfred Molina and the visual effects and camerawork impress.May 27 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic With apologies to Ben Franklin the only things certain in life are death taxes and that a Jerry Bruckheimer film will do its bombastic best to pummel pound and now parkour you into submission. ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" is all that a deaths by the thousands and the sort of spectacular spectacle possible with a rumored budget of 150 million and change. But it should be more. I realize its risky business to ask Bruckheimer for ""more"" but in a world where action trumps well everything there should be more of those white-knuckle gut-wrenching feelings churning around somewhere and there arent even with the death-defying street-style gymnastics of parkour in nearly every scene. I think its because the movies most special prince of Persia Jake Gyllenhaals Dastan is just too pretty a you know even with betrayal in the air and barbarians at the gate no one is going to mess with that face. Loosely based on Jordan Mechners video game and infused with 6th century Persian fables and fantasy director Mike Newell dives right into the crowded middle of a dusty marketplace where an orphan boy the aforementioned Dastan saves a friend from all the kings men. He will eventually change the course of history too but before he can do that the boy (Will Foster) must run for his life which turns into a mind-blowing leaping bounding tumbling primer in the seemingly impossible athletic aesthetic of parkour. Its dazzling to watch and even impresses the king (Ronald Pickup) who promptly plucks Dastan off the streets and adds him to the royal family joining older brothers Tus (Richard Coyle) and Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and uncle Nizam ( Ben Kingsley). With that all the internecine pieces are in place for an ill wind to blow. Whatever subtlety Newell has brought to his films thus far (""Donnie Brasco"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" come to mind) he has shelved it for ""Prince of Persia"" though the writers Boaz Yakin Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard most certainly had a hand. Sometimes the film suffers for it; when passion elicits laughs you know things have gotten off track. But at other times its just silly fun particularly with Sheik Amar Alfred Molinas tax-resisting renegade with his illegal ostrich races his black market double-dealing and his tax tirades (between this and ""Robin Hood"" you would think Hollywood was run by the ""tea party""). With Molina providing comic relief the rest of the story gets serious about the future of Persia to say nothing of mankind. That is never an easy task and ""Prince of Persia"" is no exception. Theres a holy city the brothers have breeched on a bad weapons-trading tip an angry king an inside traitor (and no doubt an inside trader or two) an assassination a secret killing crew and a very feisty princess (Gemma Arterton). Princess Tamina who rules the holy city that the princes seized is also the guardian of a secret mystery the sands of time which really come in handy in a pinch. As does Artertons performance a balance of passion beauty and high spirits that in many scenes saves the day. At the heart of the race and chase of the movie is a magical dagger. It has a nifty ruby red jewel to push ""in case of emergency"" that uses the mythical sand to transport whomever is holding it into a shape-shifting electrical storm that sends them back a minute or so to undo whatever bad deeds have been done. But as we all know from reading fairy tales and watching cable powerful devices in the wrong hands make for major problems. This being a story from olden times the weapons of mass destruction are a zillion different kinds of sharp pointy things that are constantly clipping ears arms and heads and embedding themselves in chests. The villains who wield most of them also dabble in dark arts and have killer snakes with magical powers that are so lame that they seem like Halloween leftovers at Wal-Mart. Still respect must be paid for all the many things the production designers the effects specialists and the stunt guys did right. Framed by the exquisite eye of director of photography John Seale who won an Oscar for ""The English Patient"" they work together to create a visually mesmerizing display. Its like two hours of July 4th fireworks only with flying swords and sandstorms and raging battles and mystical palaces rising out of the desert. Shifting sands are the perfect place for heroes and villains to lose their footing and there are many who stumble and fall as Dastan fights the good fight and falls in love. Which brings us back to the conundrum of Gyllenhaal. He has proved himself a fine actor with his closet cowboy in ""Brokeback Mountain"" still his defining moment. In Prince Dastan he is supposed to be that heady mix of street smarts roguish charm and barroom moxie with the noble heart of a lion underneath. Its a lot to ask and turns out to be something more than he can deliver. Theres just a frothiness to Gyllenhaal that he cant seem to suppress a it even lurks behind Dastans sneer a and it never fails to take the edge off. Too bad.

Prince of Persia Director Mike Newell. Cast Jake Gyllenhaal Gemma Arterton Ben Kingsley Rating PG-13 RELATED Disney/Pixar movies Spotlight Jake Gyllenhaal Adventure movies Johnny Depp makes the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies a lot of fun and theyre based on a ride at Disneyland. Try anything; you never know what might happen. Even ""The Godfather"" that most-hallowed of films is based on a novel of which it can be charitably said that most rare of things The movie is (much) better. So on its face theres nothing wrong with basing a movie on ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" a popular video game. Why not? However director Mike Newell might have at least made it feel like watching a movie and not playing the game. The audience should be given game controllers upon entering the theater. It wouldnt mean the film would make any more sense but at least youd feel like you had some say in the matter. Alas we simply sit and watch as a bulked-up Jake Gyllenhaal bounds from one scene to another dispatching evil and treachery along the way each episode falling after the next like another level of well a video game. Its meant to be fun not work but the plot is so loosely constructed it takes a lot of effort to piece things together. Better just to wait for Jake to mow down more bad guys and hit reset. Or ahem wait till the end. But lets start at the beginning something ""Prince of Persia"" does twice. In ancient Persia King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) notices a scruffy brave athletic kid named Dastan in the marketplace and adopts him. He grows up to be Jake Gyllenhaal or at least an adopted prince played by him. Hes raised as a brother to Tus (Richard Coyle) and Garsiv (Toby Kebbell). The kings brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley) leads his nephews to attack the city of Alamut after convincing them that weapons are hidden there (yes thats a reference to exactly what it sounds like). Once inside Alamut Dastan comes into possession of a magical dagger that can turn back time. Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) naturally wants it back. Others want it too however. If you can turn back time you can change the course of history and well maybe your life would have worked out a little differently. There are double-crosses mild surprises and a little romance most of which are as obvious as the layers of eye shadow on Kingsleys lids. There is an old-timey feel to some of the stunts and fights though there are plenty of computer-generated effects to go around as well. Gyllenhaal is a capable if somewhat mopey hero. (And for all that work in the gym he keeps his shirt on an awful lot. Hey if youve got it flaunt it.) Kingsley has a grand old time chewing scenery like hes famished. Arterton fares best. She has put in time as a Bond girl in ""Quantum of Solace"" and shown up in films such as ""The Boat that Rocked"" and ""Clash of the Titans"" and in each like here shes more interesting than the part shes playing. She deserves something bigger and better for showing patience if nothing else. Like any video game ""Prince of Persia"" has its moments. Alas once its over its also just as forgettable.

Gyllenhaal plays the grown-up Prince Dastan adopted as a resourceful street kid by a sixth-century Persian king. Stained a rich George Hamilton teak in adulthood and bravely committed to a hairstyle reminiscent of Facebook-friendless Kip Drordy on South Park Dastan has two nobly born stepbrothers Tus (Richard Coyle as the square-featured and hesitant one) and Garsiv (Toby Kebbell as the toothy and bellicose one). Together they receive counsel from their wily uncle Nazim (Ben Kingsley wearing eyeliner so beware). On Nazims recommendation the brothers attack the holy city of Alamut with fateful consequences. Dastan forms an instant rom-com sparring connection with the Alamutian princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton). The princess is serious about her duties as guardian of the dagger that contains a travel-size sample of the legendary sands with which a human can turn back time. Arterton a current Brit It actress favors rock-star eye makeup and a mall-teen pout to express Taminas deAvotion to weapons and sand. Lots more stuff happens to these game-board characters as fans of Jordan Mechners popular Prince of Persia videogame already know. To the credit of director Mike Newell (drawing on his Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire wrangling skills) a conclave of screenwriters who keep the dialogue on the sharp side and the lifes-a-game instincts of producer Jerry Bruckheimer all that Arabian Nights-like stuff unfolds at a brisk well-paced clip. Also the producers had the bright idea of encouraging indispensable Alfred Molina (An Education) to cut loose as Sheikh Amar a vibrant wheeler-dealer reminiscent of Sydney Greenstreet in Casablanca. I wish the movie werent so visually junky-looking and that the CGI action sequences (involving sand and weapons and the possible destruction of the world) werent so vacant. But hey this is what a videogame movie looks like now. I know I cant turn back time.

Bruckheimered to the hilt with the same rollicking period-piece cheesiness that typified the producers (and studio Disneys) Pirates of the Caribbean franchise this latest summer spectacle--helmed unimaginatively by Mike Newell--concerns Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) a buff wannabe-rebellious hunk whose princely status comes not from a royal bloodline but via adoption picked off the streets by a noble king (Ronald Pickup) who saw courage in the then-young scamp. Populated by strangely accented Americans and Brits posing as Middle Easterners this origin story thoroughly recalls the Mouse Houses Aladdin to the point that one half-expects Robin Williams to suddenly appear on the soundtrack and begin maniacally crooning about Agrabah.Have no fear Alfred Molina as an ostrich-racing entrepreneur more than makes up for this absence laying comedic-relief schtick on thick while simultaneously spouting more leaden ripped-from-the-headlines allusions than this flippant fable can withstand. Hot-topic currents course throughout Prince of Persias initial battle as Dastan helps his brothers-in-arms conquer a fortified sacred city only to discover that--holy Green Zone--the weapons-manufacturing facilities they sought to destroy dont exist. These lame political overtones immediately clash with the actions cartoonishness and might have mercifully died away amid the ensuing CGI hubbub if not for Molinas incessant yammering about being a ""small-business owner"" oppressed by dastardly rulers intent on levying the hard-working populace. Like Ridley Scotts Robin Hood the film equates villainy with unfair taxation but unlike that Nottingham snooze Newells popcorner at least has the good sense to try to offset its shallowly addressed contempo concerns with animated high-flying set pieces.As for the convoluted plot itself Prince of Persia charts Dastans efforts to clear his name after hes fingered for his fathers assassination a mission aided by strong-willed princess Tamina (Clash of the Titans beauty Gemma Arterton) and a magic blade that fueled by divine sand the Gods once used to try to exterminate mankind gives those who wield it the ability to travel one minute back in time. Faithfully resembling the acrobatic video-game protagonist upon whom hes based Gyllenhaals blandly roguish Dastan carries out his quest by leaping swinging and scurrying about marketplaces and crumbling ruins with pogo-stick parkour agility and the newly muscular actor--though still too sweet and amicable a presence to radiate genuine ass-kicking machismo--carries out his derring-do with engaging proficiency. Yet Newell he of Four Weddings and a Funeral is ill-suited to steward such sword-and-sandals adventure his direction--while slightly eschewing modern genre practitioners penchant for slicing-and-dicing skirmishes into visual incoherence--is too pedestrian and partial to clumsy slow-mo effects to truly energize the story.Despite tossed-off gibberish about father-son bonds nominal intrigue regarding who framed Dastan and faux-suspense over when he and Tamina will stop bickering and start sucking face its the sought-after supernatural blade that receives the lions share of attention from Newell and his digital artist accomplices The weapons use results in whirly-twirly camera movements and Dastans skin being infected with volcanic light. These scraps of moderately inspired eye candy however remain sparse and incapable of lending weight to such cash-my-paycheck-dammit material. Nowhere is that more pronounced than with Dastans uncle Nazim who is embodied with disinterest by Sir Ben Kingsley and whose stone-faced evilness is expressed via a bald head and jet-black goatee that positions the stodgy scoundrel as a mini-me Ming the Merciless.

By David Denby Gemma Arterton and Jake Gyllenhaal in a Mike Newell / Jerry Bruckheimer movie.   Credit Illustration by Thomas Fuchs The producer Jerry Bruckheimer has turned himself into a digital Cecil B. De Mille a man who was notable for the bizarre and often pointless munificence of his projects. Yet you have to give Bruckheimer credit of a sort for successfully coaxing TV-bound families out of their homes with his wildly redundant productions. In the most recent ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" slosher he and the director Gore Verbinski poured on two hours and fifty minutes worth of ice floes waterfalls steam and slime--the cinematic equivalent for those who actually stayed through the picture of a banana split with added scoops of Dulce Delish Adirondack Bear Paw and Boston Cream Pie. Now for ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" based on the video game of the same name Bruckheimer has spent an estimated hundred and fifty million dollars constructing among other things sixth-century Persian palaces (or at least their facades) in Morocco complete with towers terraces passageways and arches. Hundreds of hours in museums and libraries were devoted to scrutinizing Persian weaponry and decor to produce authentic replicas of scabbards and scimitars not to mention drapes carpets and filigreed wall decorations. A movie like this is a boon to honest craftsmen; some workers instructed to age a newly sewn costume attacked it with a cheese grater. Nevertheless apart from some sensuous Moroccan desert dunes the movie looks like schlock. The interiors which were shot in a London studio are based on Victorian Orientalist paintings in which people in robes crowd around some potentate or a lolling Scheherazade. But why copy second-rate academic works that linger in the unvisited galleries or basements of the worlds museums? These pictures have become at best culturally disreputable curiosities. (Hint to moviemakers if you want to film nineteenth-century Western notions of the Orient do it as parody or as something stylized as Fritz Lang did in 1959 with ""The Indian Tomb"" one of his mad final movies.) In the tradition of De Mille this ostentatious labor has been marshalled on behalf of a dramatically primitive story. The first ""Prince of Persia"" video game was created by the designer Jordan Mechner in 1989. Mechner revised the game a number of times and the movie which was directed by Mike Newell from a script by Boaz Yakin and Doug Miro amp; Carlo Bernard is loosely adapted from the 2003 version. The plot elements include the noble King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup); his seemingly benevolent brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley); his impatient sons (Toby Kebbell and Richard Coyle); their brother Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) a foundling whom Sharaman adopted at a street bazaar; and a magic dagger (the ""Dagger of Time"") with a glass hilt. When the hilt is filled with a special sand--a gift of the gods--it can make time run backward. Nizam wants to gain control of the weapon if he can send life back to an earlier period he can eliminate his brothers royal line and become king. Or something like that. As usual the ancient world speaks with an Oxbridge accent. Sturdy players fresh from triumphs in Shaw and Beckett stand around in turbans and robes and say such lines as ""Wise words little brother"" and ""In Alamut rests the beating heart of all life."" The classy British diction is yet another luxury item. Even Jake Gyllenhaal leaping about with a messy wet do and bulging shoulders speaks like a gent walking down the Strand. Gyllenhaal gets linked up with Gemma Arterton as Princess Tamina the guardian of the dagger. Tamina is the kind of sexy bare-midriff role that Debra Paget specialized in fifty years ago (she was the devastating Sharain in ""Omar Khayyam"") though Paget fans will be disappointed that Arterton does nothing comparable to her lethally funny naked-with-diamonds ""Snake Dance"" in Langs ""The Indian Tomb."" (Hint to lascivious moviegoers its on YouTube.) Instead Arterton plays Tamina as a saucy young thing and she and Gyllenhaal like every couple in a romantic comedy snap at each other relentlessly while slowly falling in love. The movie is pitched to adolescents but the kids in the audience groan when the two draw near yet dont kiss only to lock lips at last just before fadeout. For anyone who wants a connection to the movie that kiss isnt much to hold on to. ""Prince of Persia"" is meant purely as light entertainment but the way it draws on layers of junk is depressing. Its based on cliches not only from old paintings but from some of the fruitiest and most swollen nineteen-fifties period spectacles; all this material after passing through video games now gets loaded back into a production requiring the wealth of corporate kings. For twenty years audiences have been noticing the similarity between big action and fantasy movies and video games but ""Prince of Persia"" goes beyond similarity; it actually feels like a video game. In order to work the dagger you press a red jewel on the hilt which suspiciously resembles a button on a game controller. After a while backward motion ceases and life goes forward again. The first time this happens the effect is rather neat. By the third time you think that the filmmakers have found a convenient way to avoid the difficulties of constructing a plot that makes emotional sense. Is this the future of screenwriting? The quick reversals that add to the fun of a game make nonsense out of the loyalties and desires of flesh-and-blood characters. At the climax a good part of the plot is rapidly reversed and you may find yourself wishing that the filmmakers had wiped out everything after the opening titles. Mike Newell has made solid movies--""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Donnie Brasco""--but what he does here feels more like traffic management than like direction. Even the pop-Orientalist scenes that should be scary fun just skitter off the screen in a rush of action. The movement in this film is aided by parkour. The physical and spiritual beauty of parkour which began on the outskirts of Paris in the nineties is the sight of daredevil teens spontaneously negotiating walls fences abutments and open spaces as they race through an urban environment. Parkour is extended acrobatic movement on the fly and as something to watch it gains enormously from continuity. The parkour genius David Belle was on hand to give instruction and Gyllenhaal a good athlete jumps over a wall runs along a parapet swings on a rope to another level jumps down a kind of hollow landing twenty feet below and so on. The problem is that the movement has been broken into fragments and reassembled. The thrill of a single man mastering space is gone; here the continuity is provided by the glib editing of thrashing limbs in which you never see any given action clearly. There are some kinds of happy authenticity that cant be faked no matter how vast a fortune you spend. Florian Gallenbergers ""John Rabe"" an award-winner in Germany is not a great film but it tells an affecting story of the Second World War and one virtually unknown in America. Gallenbergers hero John Rabe (Ulrich Tukur) was a German businessman and Nazi Party member who ran the Siemens plant in Nanking China. In December 1937 as the Imperial Japanese Army approached the city Rabe trading on his party membership and on the German-Japanese alliance and aided by a few other foreigners including the American doctor Robert Wilson (Steve Buscemi) set up with the Imperial Armys grudging permission a three-and-a-half-square-mile safety zone within the city. (Before the invasion some of Rabes workers had literally hidden from an air raid under an enormous Nazi flag spread out flat on the ground.) During the ""Rape of Nanking"" beginning in mid-December and continuing for six weeks at least two hundred thousand Chinese sheltered inside the zone while the Japanese occupiers murdered as many as three hundred thousand people in the city many of them civilians. At the beginning of the movie Rabe is a forbidding paternalist with colonial attitudes; he is outraged that his poor dim Chinese workers are being menaced. Like that other ""good German"" Oskar Schindler he changes only by degrees into a passionate and wily defender of innocent lives. Much of the movies dramaturgy is tiresome the American doctor rails against the Nazi in scene after scene long after he has proved his honor; Rabes relationship with his wife is frightfully noble. But Gallenberger shooting in China mounts the externals of the story impressively. There are heart-in-mouth passages in which the Japanese soldiers barge into the zone. And when Rabe ventures outside he sees terrifying intimations of the slaughter including a double row of severed heads aligned with military precision. One of the main virtues of ""John Rabe"" is to demonstrate that however much we know about the worst of all wars it still has little-known corners that can amaze us.

As with his instalment in the Harry Potter saga Mike Newell was clearly brought in to add a touch of dramatic gravitas to this flimsiest of summer blockbusters. Its a strategy which pays off - but only just.The plot feels cobbled together from myriad sources a pinch of The Thief of Baghdad a smattering of The Mummy and a hefty dollop of The Thousand and One Nights. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Dastan a one-time street urchin (natch) elevated to Persian Princeling by the generosity of good King Sharaman. But when Dastan goes against his two brothers and their scheming uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley whose moustache is just too short to twirl malevolently) hes framed for the kings murder and flees into the desert with only his camel and a bad-tempered princess (Gemma Arterton) for company. As this synopsis suggests Newell and his screenwriters leave no historical fantasy cliche unmolested and thats before we get to the mystical dagger the supernatural assassins and Alfred Molina as a jolly morally dubious gambler. The story does feel overfamiliar and suffers from a lack of dramatic tension as a consequence. Matters arent helped by shoddy CGI and some seriously silly last-act developments.But Newell keeps things moving at a lick barely allowing his actors a pause for breath between bouts of knockabout banter before chucking them into another athletic action scene. And Gyllenhaal is good value his natural vulnerability working to offset some slightly alarming action-hero abs. Prince of Persia wont linger long in the memory - but then it probably wasnt meant to.

Just read the reviews on here for that poof of concept. Those who compare it to Oscar winning films award winning actors literary classics and even other video games show they have a good grasp of what a film should be about. Those who type in one line about it being ""awesome"" or ""great"" but actually say nothing about WHY its supposedly ""Awesome"" or ""Great"" are showing how little they really know care or think. I bet these are the same low brow hoards who think that ""Survivor - 5 Star Vacation worth 40 grand a person"" or ""Jerry Springer - Whores on Stage"" is ""Great"" and ""Awesome"" too. Some people will pay to see anything. Hey what about a 3 hour film about paint drying? That would be ""Awesome"" huh?

Very enjoyable......once. hope that makes senseHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 2 2010Toronto GuyFeaturedWhile fully aware of the films roots being in yet another video game like the Lara Croft Tomb Raider flicks of the past few years I had great anticipation this one would be as attention grabbing and thoughtfully pieced together as Angelinas movies. I was DEAD WRONG. Looking like a set stolen from Disneys animated Aladin film complete with a ""street rat"" beggar thief who gets chased through the streets of ""Agribah""... oops Agribah was the Disney city Aladin was chased around in this movie they called it ""Alamot""... by evil royal henchmen and then cut to scene where hes a prince in the royal palace. Sadly this film was missing Robin Williams comedic Geni of The Lamp and the cute animated flying carpet to bring about any sense of why I spent money on the ticket to see this. The plot as flimsy as it was executed; certainly had all the great stuff we look for in an installment of The Mummy... Evil plotting royal advisers seductive yet cryptic female protagonists sword fighting and digging around in deserts of sand and... oh this wasnt The Mummy part 4? Right... sorry... So the video game... yes A time controlling enchanted triangle that gives only its posessor the power to control time but the evil cult called the Illuminati... oh that wasnt the right video game... that was Lara Croft again wasnt it? My bad. I may have nodded off... did I miss the part where Donny Osmond sang about his ""Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" or where the cast of Glee did that Bangles number ""Walk like an Egyptian""? Oh... now Im confused.... What movie was this again? Something about rags to riches street trash making it big then being betrayed by his family and getting run out of town but after finding some enchanted knife and getting stuck in the sand he eventually gets the girl in the end. OK yeah... So wasnt Excalibur a great film I mean those knights of the round table really had it in for Lancelot but he and Guinevere persevered and in the end Camelot was saved. No? OKay well... This film sucked. Not only can they not steal from great literature properly not only can they not admirably copy the right pieces of Disney masterpieces that made those films great not only can they not plagiarize the plot of a rival gaming firm like the Tomb Raider series properly they cant even cast Harrison Ford as Indy in this one... oh different super star of Desert adventure films my bad again. If you liked Pineapple Express... (probably because you were fried off your azz when you went to see it) youll be able to tolerate this one too... well so long as youre fried for this one too. Otherwise save your money and do something useful with it like throw it out of your car window on the freeway.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 2 2010hukiworldFeaturedI thought the movie was awesome I am glad I am not a movie critic because they NEVER enjoy any movie they watch their too busy over analyzing the entire film from minute one till credits end.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 2 2010hukiworldFeaturedI thought the movie was awesome I am glad I am not a movie critic because they NEVER enjoy any movie they watch their too busy over analyzing the entire film from minute one till credits end.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 31 2010jimboFeaturedOMG its the dicovery channel?history channel/national geographic"" all our persian yesteryears"" rolled into one dull lecture .

Unfortunately the only similarities to that were the prince and the dagger of time. Do not go if youre a fan of the games you will be disappointed. Some of the archetypes and dynamics expected were there but there were so few consistencies that unless you are able to take it completely separately from the games there is no way to enjoy it.

Shot in Morocco with a custom -made script which casts a scarred -hirsute -Jake Gyllenhall as the adopted prince[DASTAN ] who is the man who will save the empire and humanity both from evil the script does not make him into a pretty vacuous super man character but a real flawed warrior with uneven teeth and a twinkle in his eyes who can be both charmingly naive and truly agile in battle and yet make erroneous blunders which bring much humour to the script . The dialogues are penned with enough tongue in cheek ribaldry and the initial romantic squirmishes between Jake and Gemmaplaying princess tamina  as the custodian of an ancient sacred icon that can reverse time are charmingly playful in a mischievous mood . The fantastic art design compliments the great CGI and the background score is as harmonious as the even editing to induce a bauble of a fun frolic which is almost a reminder of the playful fantasy productions from good old hollywood and it delivers despite all the stereotypes and villains and bumbling clowns as it is well crafted rather than trying to be ground -breaking or historically accurate . It is a comic book adventure adapted from a computer game  with great casting where the producer has done a great job from casting gemma as princess tamina to ben kingslay as the mysterious brother to the king of persia and even the army of extras look authentic . The stunts are staged clearly and in a credible manner where any one will appreciate them as you can see the eclectic rooftop chases in immaculate detail  and the sword duels are all very genuine with the truly terrifying knife-throwing stunt executed in a masterly sequence . This is cinema in good old tradition and applies to omnivrous tastes where it will attract a wide audience . I even enjoyed the melfluous song by Alanis Morisette over the titles in the end -i remain which describes the theme very well as a human struggle for purity and justice through the sands of time and the bizarre mystery of the paradox of fate that connects the destiny of human souls in a parable called life . The bonus is the great villain who controls the serpents in horrifying detail and the desert bandits who are at odds with each other as a nemesis and a ragtag band of cut-throats with a conscience . This will make stars of both Jake Gylenhall and Gemma Artreton but the real star is the pristine production THANKS TO MR.BRUCKHEIMER .Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 22 2010JAGFeaturedIt is clearly a flawed movie with too much ""easy going"" comments from time to time. I would say that Atherton would certainly not have been my choice of lead although she comes out quite a better than expected. Jake I expected differently but again rather difficult to play both serious and then offbeat yet things held together. On the other hand there is a magic which blends the dreamy Middle East to the special effects action sequences and story which puts the movie leagues ahead of Clash of the Titans for example. If only it had taken itself a bit more seriously it could have been very good. Oh and great soundtrack.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 22 2010Loz DozFeaturedI really really wanted to like this film as a huge fan of the first two prince of persia games and of the cast of this film it just didnt do anything for me and this is my genre of film too. Personally i thought the plot was weak the characters a bit confusing are they storng or fragile? changing every 5 mins and the whole thing a bit lackluster. Such a shame have been looking forward to seeing this for months. Am gutted for Jake and Gemma too. The scorpion king and the mummy are much better films in this genre. Play the games instead you wont be dissapointed with those.

""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" is silky to the touch but slips from the mind all too easily. Based loosely on a series of popular videogames producer Jerry Bruckheimers passably enjoyable antiquity-themed epic should satisfy its young male core demographic well enough but wont connect with other auds on the level of Bruckheimers ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. Mike Newells workmanlike helming is no embarrassment but pics lack of game-changing originality distinguishing anarchic streak or 3D wow factor may relegate this to summertime also-ran status. From its opening moments -- as mock-medieval subtitles foretell lives shaped by destiny and a map of ancient Persia shows the empires scale -- ""Prince"" feels resolutely old-fashioned. Until Alfred Molina shows up as a comic-relief proto-libertarian half-way through the script lacks the deliberately anachronistic tongue-in-cheek humor auds have come to expect from big-budget period productions. Remove the state-of-the-art f/x and ""Prince"" would look of a piece with the 1924 Douglas Fairbanks version of ""The Thief of Bagdad."" Its more throwback than retro refit. That said the script credited to Boaz Yakin Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard (based on a story by Jordan Mechner who created the original games) smuggles in one major contempo subtext The whole plot hinges on the fact that the baddie has tricked the Persian Army into invading the city of Alamut because its denizens are supposedly smuggling weapons of minor destruction (basically swords) to Persias enemies. The films cloudy allegory about the current war in Iraq might spark some debate but on the surface its message about brotherhood is much more anodyne. When young street-rat Dastan (Will Foster) catches the eye of King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) in the city market the king raises Dastan as his own son (he grows up to be Jake Gyllenhaal) alongside his natural-born sons Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) the empires good-hearted heir and the more belligerent Tus (Richard Coyle). Sharamans brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley wearing eyeliner and a sneer borrowed from Jafar in ""Aladdin"") acts as a shadowy adviser to the court. During the sacking of Alamut Dastan gets his hands on a beautiful dagger with a crystal hilt that holds the titular sands of time. When anyone clicks a ruby on the hilt the dagger like a magic ballpoint sends that person a minute back in time prompting brief storms of swirling animated gold dust and visual effects. Haughty but hot Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) wants the dagger back. She goes on the run with Dastan when hes accused of murdering his father and the two eventually fall into each others arms -- but first into the greasy clutches of Molinas shady Sheik Amar a roguish self-styled ""promoter"" who runs ostrich races and hates tax collectors. Even auds who have never heard of ""Prince of Persia"" will be able to spot that this is all derived from a platform-based computer game so metronomic is the pics pacing of fights and action scenes escalating to a final showdown between Dastan and his biggest foe. The interstitial slabs of drama are just about substantial enough to maintain moderate grown-up interest although the dialogue is largely boilerplate Bruckheimer a mix of heroic declamations painstakingly spelt-out explication and semi-amusing wisecracks. Scripts cleverest move is a structural tweak in the last reel that evokes a game players approach to story. Having limbered up with ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" protean Brit helmer Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Donnie Brasco"") does just fine popping the actions kernels but any personal seasoning can hardly be tasted. Perhaps what Newell brought most to the party was an affinity with the almost entirely British cast and crew. (Apart from the Moroccan locations pic was shot at Pinewood Studios and many of the post-production companies are Blighty-based.) Thesping is generally adequate but no better with the expressive Arterton best in show and Gyllenhaal a minor disappointment. Physically he has the grace and chiseled biceps of a megastar in the making but the wolfish charisma he usually projects in smaller dramas seems to have degraded here into hangdog dopiness. (The unflattering heavy-metal haircut doesnt help.) The ever-reliable Molina adds sparkle but no one else seems to be having that much fun or doing what Johnny Depp did for ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Well-integrated production design by Wolf Kroeger and costumes by Penny Rose blend looks and motifs ranging from ancient Mesopotamia to medieval India to fashion a glittering mash-up of orientalist kitsch. From the intricate cityscapes to the f/x setpieces when the sands of time do their thing theres a sense the pic has altogether too much design and not enough style.
