K.C. Bailey/Universal Studios hide caption toggle caption K.C. Bailey/Universal Studios Mommy lore At a birthing class Kate (Tina Fey left) takes notes while Angie (Amy Poehler) investigates the mysteries of the breast pump. K.C. Bailey/Universal Studios Director Michael McCullersGenre ComedyRunning Time 96 minutes Watch a Clip Saturday Night Lives DNA is all over this surrogate-pregnancy comedy comedians Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as the sophisticated mom and dim-bulb vessel SNL guest stars in lesser roles and an SNL writer making his directing debut. So the obvious question Do they um deliver? Well there are plenty of laughs. Also a plot line that plays like a series of comedy sketches -- Fey baby-proofs the apartment which means Poehler cant open the toilet; Fey works for an all-organic retailer but Poehler only likes junk food and so forth. Scene-stealing subordinate characters - a ponytailed crunchy-granolified Steve Martin as Kates boss Sigourney Weaver as an alarmingly fertile-in-her-50s surrogate-agency rep Siobhan Fallon as a consonant-challenged birthing instructor and especially Dax Shepard as Angies breathtakingly trashy common-law hubby -- animate the margins of the story. And if the plot is predictable its a perfectly serviceable clothesline for writer-director Michael McCullers jokes. Would those jokes be better served by a more experienced director? Probably. Still McCullers tendency to step on laughs wont be as noticeable when the film hits DVD in a few months. And in that format if you hear your inner clock ticking during the last half hour youll be able to hit fast-forward.

Bailey) B+ Baby Mama Genre Comedy; Starring Tina Fey Amy Poehler Greg Kinnear; Director Michael McCullers; Author Michael McCullers; Release Date Wide 04/25/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 96; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted April 25 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT More than any other woman working in comedy today Tina Fey has figured out how to charm men while speaking sisterly truth in a frequency heard only by other women. Thats an awesome skill and with it comes awesome power. Forthright yet inclusive tough yet effortlessly feminine an alumna of SNL and the creator of a brilliant hit network sitcom she has the means to affect our nations political discourse with a waggle of her trademark brainy-babe eyeglasses and one well-placed declaration. ""Bitch is the new black"" will do for starters. Baby Mama a teeteringly uneven comedy isnt much of a conversation starter but it does at least bring a politicized raised eyebrow to the sacred realm of pregnancy and motherhood among a certain estrogenically mindful population of entitled thirtysomethings. Youd think this most fertile of laugh territories would be a perfect Fey playground. And it is at least when the star as upscale 37-year-old executive Kate Holbrook is seen in her natural career habitat as a woman holding her own among men. (Kates company runs a chain of health-food stores -- a delicious contradiction in business models. Better yet Steve Martin plays the New Age-y capitalist who runs the venture.) But then a longing for motherhood grips singleton Kate whose inability to conceive leads her to comedy-sister-in-arms Amy Poehler as Angie Ostrowiski a downscale surrogate with a womb for rent. And when pregnant Angie moves into her employers tasteful home the contrasting foibles of class socioeconomics and wardrobe choices are all too broadly sketched by the two femme comrades. Written by SNL alum Michael McCullers who makes his directing debut with gawky visual inexperience Baby Mama turns square midway through the pregnancy saga then heads for a most un-Fey-like aw-gee tale of happily-ever-after. There is it turns out a guy to fit our gal and hes played by Greg Kinnear; Angie meanwhile learns better nutrition and how not to urinate in the sink and thus broaden her horizons. Poehler is as improv-sketch loose in her performance as Fey is measured and both are challenged to a thespian throwdown by a fearsomely funny Sigourney Weaver as the smug head of the surrogacy agency. But although the big picture itself gets mushy the small moments especially involving Fey are sharp. Every inch a woman who conveys an ease in her own skin she has become a madame comedy ambassador of her sex able to negotiate with the big boys then relate the experience in a way that has the smart girls hooting with knowing laughter.

Babies are invincibly cute and movies about efforts to produce them are proliferating these days. Thats partly because the efforts are ever more varied what with reproductive technologies taking over where Kama Sutra positions leave off. This movie which reunites the ""Saturday Night Live"" news anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler turns surrogate motherhood into an ""Odd Couple"" sitcom with conflicts of class that resolve into sisterhood. Its clumsy not cute an amateur show thats eager to amuse by any means -- a stroller with airbags a birthing counselor with an Elmer Fudd accent (""As your pwegnancy pwogwesses...""). Yet the show is redeemed by its co-stars up to a pwoint. ENLARGE They struggle womanfully and sometimes successfully to find truth in the scripts silly symphony of false notes. (The writer-director is another graduate of ""Saturday Night Live"" Michael McCullers. Its his feature debut behind the camera and his inexperience shows.) Ms. Fey is Kate an executive at a Whole Foodsie health-food chain called Round Earth. At the age of 37 Kate will do whatever it takes to have a baby -- her chances of getting pregnant shes told are remote. Ms. Poehlers surrogate mother Angie is what it takes. Angie chews gum drinks beer bleaches her hair contends with a boorish young husband and signs up under fraught circumstances to carry Kates baby. Other characters call her white trash or trailer trash but Id call her a crypto-sophisticate because Amy Poehler is just too smart for the narrow room of her characters stereotype. (Indeed her best scene and the only scene in the movie that really catches fire turns on Angie pretending to be Kates rich too-hip sister.) Tina Fey has it easier since Kate is genuinely sophisticated; her many moments of simplicity and humanity elevate a sub-par comedy to approximately par for the late doldrums course. But what an ill-tended course that is. ""Baby Mama"" is the kind of coarse-textured studio production that can make you cringe though it will surely do big business; all the pieces of a reliable formula are in place. The camera work is aggressively ugly as overlit as an interrogation room. Plot twists announce themselves far in advance as if surprise would violate the sacred contract between movie and audience. Sigourney Weaver plays the hypo-fertile head of a fertility clinic with leaden humor. Steve Martin isnt funny at all as Round Earths New Age founder. Greg Kinnear on the other hand is a pleasant though sporadic presence as the owner of a health-juice bar. So is Romany Malco as Oscar a doorman doubling as a psychiatrist. Occasionally Oscar even triples as a birth counselor. He doesnt talk like Elmer Fudd. Then She Found Me ENLARGE Matthew Broderick and Helen Hunt in ""Then She Found Me."" Helen Hunt stars in ""Then She Found Me"" another drama about the complexities of becoming a mother with another biological clock thats ticking like a time bomb. (This heroine a gaunt-faced grade-school teacher named April Epner is 39 years old.) Ms. Hunt directed in another feature debut and wrote the script with Alice Arlen and Victor Levin. Three writers may seem like a lot for a relatively modest picture but not when compared to the 13 people credited as producers. I mention this because the movie is a bizarre overcooked broth that combines a broad sitcom style (the banter goes rat-tat-tat like a steam drill) with a preposterous succession of plot complications plus solemn questions of identity adoption and the nature of happiness. At first adoption seems to be the core issue. April an adoptee doesnt want to repeat her history by adopting so she struggles to get pregnant. (Matthew Broderick plays her unappealingly infantile husband unappealingly.) But theres no escaping the past at least in this picture. Suddenly Bette Midler shows up as Aprils long-lost birth mother who wants to share her life. Then theres no escaping Bette Midler at least until her outsize performance scales down a good while later when the script turns its scattered attention back to pregnancy and to the possibility of a romance between April and the father of one of her pupils. Hes played by Colin Firth who is not at his best. Its hard to be Mr. Right in the wrong movie. Jellyfish ENLARGE Nikol Leidman in ""Jellyfish."" Jellyfish are magical creatures diaphanous drifters and silent shape shifters. The three women drifting through the Israeli drama ""Jellyfish"" change too though in their emotions rather than their outward form. And if they arent silent the melancholy trio -- a young waitress a young bride and a Filipina caregiver who speaks no Hebrew -- are seriously withdrawn. Etgar Keret and Shira Geffen have made a mysterious film full of existential anxiety in which lonely people all connected to the sea find ways to repair their lives. I have an aversion to such intricately interlocked movies as ""Babel"" or ""Crash"" -- for all their pretensions and astral connections theyre basically stunts -- and my feelings about ""Jellyfish"" are much the same. But this film is handsomely made and I wont soon forget the almost Jungian image of a wide-eyed child -- emerging from the sea with a red and white lifesaver around her little belly. Morgenstern DVD Tip Take your choice between a great performance -- Diane Keatons as the uber-yuppie feminist executive who inherits a baby in the 1987 comedy ""Baby Boom"" -- or the marvelous creepiness of ""Rosemarys Baby"" (1968) the judiciously camp gothic thriller directed by Roman Polanski. Mia Farrow is the innocent girl from Nebraska who finds that the devil is in the details of her pregnancy.

Maybe we havenat seen quite that many movies recently about pregnant single women. It probably just seems that in the past year virtually every romantic comedy has been about some waitress named Juno getting knocked up. And she didnat plan to get pregnant doesnat really want the baby but because she has a strong will and nurturing instincts sheall never-ever give it up. Practically the funniest thing about these movies is the sociopolitical spin Hollywood implants in them that accidental motherhood is the new feminism. Baby Mama to the rescue The movie written and directed by Saturday Night Live scribe Michael McCullers dares to imagine that somewhere in this world of carelessly ceaselessly fertile females there might be one woman who wants a baby but canat have it. Her name is Kate Holbrook (Tina Fey) sheas 37 lives in Philadelphia has an OK job working for a goofy whole-foods guru (Steve Martin) yet feels somehow empty no man no marriage and especially no baby. aI just donat like your uterusa her gynecologist (John Hodgman) tells her adding that Kate has a one-in-a-million chance of ever getting pregnant. (You should be able to guess Act Three from here.) So she engages Angie Ostrowiski (Amy Poehler) a white-trashy girl from the nearby town of Dreery to be the childas surrogate mother. When she breaks up with her loutish boyfriend Carl (Dax Shepard) slobby Angie moves in with neatnik Kate. In social aptitude one woman is the baby the other the mama. Except for the natural nine-month dramatic arc (which is what attracts writers to the pregnancy plot) this is prime-time sitcom fodder. Oscar and Felix; Kate and Angie. Iam not making claims that Baby Mama transcends the formatas routine progressions -- opposites not only attract they learn from each other -- only that within these conventions the movie is smart funny and beguiling. Hitting familiar buttons isnat a sin if the exercise is carried off expertly as it is here. And the two stars deprived of the opportunity for girlish giggling they took undue advantage of as SNLas Weekend Update anchors relax into their characters give them a dimension precisely as real as this kind of movie requires. McCullersa best trick is to keep viewers unsure of which side they should be on before they realize the storyas not about confrontation but collaboration. Neither character is a caricature. Kate could be the snooty Bryn Mawr deb of old movies -- the one whose class prejudices must be exposed by the working-class hero or heroine -- but no sheas decent patient and hard-working. (And unexpectedly curvy-sexy in the mandatory straight-girl-has-to-get-drunk-and-go-crrraaazy scene.) Most of all Kate wants only whatas best for her baby even if it drives the surrogate mom nuts. As for Angie she could be a Conshohocken crumpet the idiot spawn of two siblings the ramshackle hovel in which Kateas baby is imprisoned. Instead sheas spirited resourceful and crafty of mouth always ready to parry an accusation with some counterfeit common sense. Sheas also smart enough to overcome the garbage education daytime TV has saddled her with. The meeting of disparate souls brings with it the inevitable apology swap. Kate aIam sorry I called you stupid.a Angie aIam sorry I farted into your purse.a Much is made of the regimen Kate wants to put her surrogate on. Angie argues that a package of food stamped aorganica kind of defeats its own purpose if it deprives consumers of the basic allure of food yumminess. As she opines aThat crapas for rich people who hate themselves.a And later aIam not tryina to be dramatic but I would rather be shot in the face than eat this food.a Why shouldnat she stick to her diet of Dr. Pepper Pringles TastyKakes Red Bull and the occasional cigarette? And when threats donat work Angie tries logic aThereas a thing called being too healthy. Thatas what killed Bruce Lee.a (It was more likely a brain aneurysm.) Angie/Amy may lose this debate on points but she wins on presentation because she looks slim radiant great. If junk food is what got her that body plenty of women watching will say aIall have what sheas having.a The rules of romantic comedy stipulate that Kate must stumble across initially resist then fall into the arms of a perfect guy. That would be Rob (Greg Kinnear) who runs a fruit-drink shop in the neighborhood where Kateas boss is erecting one of his pricey stores. Fortunately that subplot lasts for about three minutes and Kinnear can return to exuding his trademark mixture of blithe assurance and brow-furrowing self-depreciation. For this attractive actor itas a blessing and a curse heas got the perfect romantic-comedy skills but heas in the one decade when the genre isnat flourishing. Fred MacMurray Ray Milland and many lesser lights built long careers without the charm Kinnear has shown in As Good As It Gets Sabrina Nurse Betty and Feast of Love. His appeal is an anachronism; perhaps he should go back to playing the suburban sexaholic he did in Autofocus. Or maybe his domesticated grace is more suited for a high-quality sitcom. Of course Baby Mama isnat his movie. Itas a chick flick with the emphasis on the hatching. Comedies almost always run out of gas toward the end; the writer is like a parent on Christmas Eve desperately wrapping up his presents. But this movie finds one last spurt to send the characters and the audience out happy. The closing-credits song the Ronettesa aBe My Babya never seemed more welcome or appropriate. For this is a comedy with the old-time blend of wit and sentiment. Years from now when you stumble across it on TV you could persuade yourself that back in the two-thousand-oughts they made pretty good movies.

Bailey Movie review No belly laughs in Baby Mama 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Baby Mama Comedy. Starring Tina Fey Amy Poehler and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Michael McCullers. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to SFGate.com/movies.) One of the weirder things about American movies of recent years is that theyre very good at dealing with impersonal subjects with public things but when it comes to taking on personal matters they seem tentative and embarrassed. We do crime adventure action thrillers suspense science fiction and monster movies with assurance but when the time comes to make a movie about human feeling and about normal people just interacting we collapse into knots of conflicted impulse. You could blast for it and you still wont find 30 uninterrupted seconds of truth in ""Baby Mama."" The characters are lies. Their emotional workings are lies. The jokes are based on lies about human behavior. The relationships bear no relationship to any that might occur in real life even as exaggerations. Its a movie that deals in emotion and attempts to pass counterfeit goods. Theres nothing there... . And yet by the deprived standards of the modern romantic comedy one would have to say well its not bad. Its not bad because Tina Fey stars in it and theres something truthful about her even if the surroundings are phony. She radiates sanity a quality of wit and sensitivity versus a dumb and demented world and because we know shes been funny elsewhere theres a tendency to think shes funny here or at least to pretend for her sake. She plays Kate a 37-year-old business executive whose biological clock has turned into a biological gong - she wants a baby now. When she finds out that something about her uterus makes it almost impossible for her to conceive she decides to use a surrogate mother. The makings are there for a well-observed comedy. A lot of women in America are going through this pursuing careers through their prime years for conception and then finding themselves dealing with problems of infertility. The phenomenon is widespread enough for someone to explore the lighter side of it or satirize aspects of it or gently have fun with it in some other way. But no. Instead ""Baby Mama"" contorts itself into some slapstick social commentary about the clash between working-class and professional-class mores. The working-class surrogate (Amy Poehler) that Kate (Fey) hires moves into Kates lavish apartment and starts spending her days eating junk food and watching ""Americas Funniest Home Videos."" And with that writer-director Michael Mullers exhausts his vast knowledge of working-class life. He may be making a class comedy but all the same he has a few half-hearted stereotypes to put out there and nothing more. The movie isnt based on any discernible observation or insight just on somebodys vague impulse to make a certain kind of joke. Its pitiful. The relationship between the women which is at the center of the action changes from scene to scene with no internal consistency and Poehler playing a stereotype of a stereotype never figures out a way to be funny. Its typical of weak comedies that the funniest elements have nothing to do with the main thrust of the story. Sigourney Weavers brief scenes as the head of the surrogate mothers company turn on one repeated comic bit very funny about her being in her 50s and yet still remaining fertile. For some reason the younger women are viscerally horrified by her and when she mentions that shes ""expecting"" one of them mutters ""What? A Social Security check?"" The other consistent comic element is Steve Martin who plays Kates boss. Wearing a long gray ponytail he exudes beatific self-love as only Martin can and the ridiculous wig only makes him funnier. He looks like a New Age George Washington. -- Advisory Crude sexual humor and a drug reference.

This was my thought after sitting through Helen Hunts debut as a director ""Then She Found Me."" The movie--like another comedy opening this weekend ""Baby Mama""--is about a woman desperate to have a baby. April Epner (Hunt) is a 39-year-old kindergarten teacher whose biological clock is ticking noisily. Though everyone tells her to adopt she adamantly refuses having been adopted herself. She wants pregnancy. This adaptation of an Elinor Lipman novel (written by Alice Arlen Victor Levin and Hunt) picks up her story as she weds mamas boy Ben (Matthew Broderick). Not long afterward her adoptive mom dies and the hapless Ben decides matrimony was a mistake and flees.The dramedy proper begins when two new figures enter Aprils floundering life. Frank (Colin Firth) is the angry frazzled newly divorced father of one of her students and we instantly know because Hunt casts everyone (except herself) strictly according to type that this simmering seductive Brit will loom large in her romantic future. Enter Bette Midler as Bernice Graves a woman claiming to be Aprils actual mom. Bernice is a brassily insincere local TV talk show host and a world-class liar (she tells April shes the love child of a one-night stand with Steve McQueen). April wants nothing to do with her until a DNA test confirms that Bernice is not lying about being her mom.Theres real anguish and an undertone of constant anxiety in ""Then She Found Me""--all of it contained in Hunts torn and frayed performance. But April--gaunt jittery and angry--is a three-dimensional character trapped in a two-dimensional romantic comedy. For as a director the TV veteran Hunt tends to hedge her bets retreating to the safety of sitcom beats whenever the movie threatens to become too lugubrious. As nice as it is to see Midler back in action she seems to be in a different broader movie. Shes never allowed to break out of her sashaying artificial persona. Sure shes playing a flamboyant performer but the real woman underneath--which Midler is perfectly capable of playing--never emerges. Firth too tends to overdo his seething rage while Broderick reprises his patented boy-man routine sweet and ineffectual. It might have been a lot more interesting--and a lot less predictable--if the two had switched roles. As it is the inevitable second act snag that jeopardizes the made-for-each-other relationship between April and Frank (which has to do with her raging sexual attraction to her estranged husband) is particularly hard to swallow. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Theres a quirky honest movie struggling to emerge from ""Then She Found Me"" (Aprils Jewish heritage is refreshingly portrayed and there are lovely scattered moments when the characters surprise you) but Hunt in her directorial debut cant seem to decide whether shed rather make a spicy ethnic dish or bland comfort food.""Baby Mama"" is no less formulaic but this broad odd-couple girl comedy has the advantage of knowing what it is. Tina Fey is 37-year-old yuppie extraordinaire Kate Holbrook vice president of Round Earth organic foods and a woman who until this moment has chosen a career over relationships and motherhood. Now she too hears that bio-clock ticking but having been told that she has a one in a million chance of conceiving (due according to her doctor to her T-shaped uterus) she decides to go the surrogate mom route. The surrogate is Angie Ostrowiski (Amy Poehler) and as her lumpen name implies shes the polar opposite of affluent persnickety Kate gum-chewing Red Bull-chugging trailer trash. Destined to share Kates upscale Philadelphia apartment when Angie breaks up with her low-rent common-law husband (Dax Shepard) this oil-and-vinegar couple must learn to get along. And as Im sure you could guess before ""Baby Mama"" is over each will have something to teach the other.Fortunately the pieties are kept well in check in Michael McCullerss movie which he (not Fey as you might have assumed) wrote and directed (though both Fey and Poehler ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni did a fair share of improvising). McCullers who co-wrote a couple of the Austin Powers movies has zero visual flair as a director and the laughs come sporadically. But the film has some smarts about class differences; Kate is so obsessive about babyproofing her apartment that Angie cant figure out how to open the toilet and ends up using the sink. When the PC yuppie tries to force indigestible organic food on the junk-food-loving surrogate Angie dismisses it witheringly ""That crap is for rich people who hate themselves.""Feys Kate for all her trendy compulsiveness is surprisingly likable never succumbing to the tired stereotype of the sterile yuppie who has sacrificed her sexuality and her soul for success. Poehlers role gets the bigger laughs shes a gifted rubber-faced comedienne particularly winning when caught red-handed in one gaucherie after another--like sticking her gum under the coffee table--she outright denies what shes done.When the central odd-couple joke threatens to get tired--and the inspiration does flag--""Baby Mama"" is rescued by two scene-stealing veterans Sigourney Weaver as the smug patrician owner of the surrogate company and a priceless ponytailed Steve Martin as the self-infatuated New Age owner of Round Earth. These two arent onscreen a lot but the movie seems most fully alive when they are. And Greg Kinnear as a former corporate lawyer who now runs a juice bar--you knew there had to be a romantic interest for Kate before the fade out didnt you?--gets the maximum out of a fairly thankless male ingenue role.Arent we always told that Hollywood is averse to making movies about women over 25? If nothing else ""Baby Mama"" and ""Then She Found Me"" put that truism to rest. For one weekend out of the year anyway chick flicks rule.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

BAILEYHired surrogate mother Amy Poehler has a question at a Lamaze class she attends with her employer Tina Fey in ""Baby Mama."" Baby Mama (PG-13) Universal (96 min.) Directed by Michael McCullers. With Tina Fey Amy Poehler. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE STARS Kate Holbrook is 37 poised professional and rich. She has a terrific Philadelphia apartment a mildly interesting job with a hippie/corporate supermarket chain and a charming self-deprecating sense of humor. What she doesnt have -- and desperately wants -- is a baby. ""When other women were getting pregnant"" she announces glumly ""I was getting promotions."" She coos over infants in checkout lines dreams of decorating a nursery. But her neediness is starting to scare off potential mates (Tip to singletons Do not discuss uterus on first date) and adoption takes years. And so Kate decides on well ""outsourcing"" the job. Thats the set-up for ""Baby Mama"" and as its a comedy naturally the script pairs up Kate with the least-likely birth mother a trashy gal whose idea of a three-course meal is a Big Gulp and a pack of Yodels. When circumstances demand the pregnant surrogate and prissy client move in together you can hear the comic gears click into place. Its like ""The Odd Couple"" -- but with morning-sickness jokes. Luckily for ""Baby Mama"" and for us theyre pretty good morning-sickness jokes. And so are the gags about fascist Lamaze instructors ""What to Paranoically Obsess Over When Youre Expecting"" books and crunchy-granola-parents-to-be classes where everything is validated except the parking. Credit writer/director Michael McCullers for a lot of that. A former ""Saturday Night Live"" scribe he keeps things fast and light. The Philadelphia locations are fresh the musical choices clever and the cast full of smart professionals. Smartest among them as Kate is Tina Fey the wry writer who with ""30 Rock"" transformed herself into a charming and contemporary pop-culture princess -- Mary Richards with an attitude Ally McBeal without the cringe-worthy neuroses. The movie shares her sensibility too. Although her name is in the credits solely as an actress the cast includes Feys good friend Amy Poehler as her rowdy incubator and another former ""Saturday Night Live"" comic as a birthing instructor. Many of the best scenes and characters -- including a hilarious Sigourney Weaver as a preposterously fertile infertility expert -- also display Feys signature snark. Other parts of the movie feel more programmatic. Giving a supporting role to Steve Martin feels more nostalgic than anything else and its doubtful a courtroom ending has worked for any comedy since the original ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."" Give the movie credit for not giving Fey a cliched gay best friend; take away credit for providing instead a cliched black best friend (whose supposedly wicked observations all boil down to a basic head-shaking ""These white folks is crazy."") But even if the movie does start to lose steam in the last 20 minutes (even as it furiously cranks up the plot to deliver a completely predictable ""surprise"" ending) the first hour or so are fine. Its lively. Its amusing. Its gestation includes some well-worn but welcome shots at yuppie baby-strollers and over-thought parenting. And in the end despite some complications it successfully gives birth to a very happy event The arrival of Tina Fey movie star. Rating note The film contains strong language heavy drinking and adult situations. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Uptight businesswoman befriends the slob she hires to carry her baby. With Tina Fey Amy Poehler Steve Martin. Director Michael McCullers (136). PG-13 Anatomical humor language. At area theaters.Every generation deserves their version of ""The Odd Couple"" and Tina Fey and Amy Poehler deliver the goods in ""Baby Mama."" The one-time ""Saturday Night Live"" co-anchors up the stakes in the opposites-cohabiting idea The neat freak and the slob dont just share an apartment - they share responsibility for Poehlers uterus.Feys Kate Holbrook is a driven exec at a Whole Foods-like grocery chain. Eager to have a baby but boyfriend-less shes turned down by adoption agencies. So Kate makes a withdrawal from a sperm bank and heads off to find a ""gestational employee."" Satisfied with her ingenuity Kate struts down the street holding her donors vial as if it were an iced frappuccino. However her choice for surrogate mother half-baked Angie (Poehler) turns out to be the wrong oven for a bun as Kate finds when Angie breaks up with her deadbeat husband Carl (Dax Shepard) and moves into Kates Philadelphia apartment leaving Red Bull cans and junk food wrappers in her wake. Written and directed by Michael McCullers a writer during Feys early ""SNL"" days ""Baby Mama"" is an equal-opportunity lark. It gives Shepard a proper platform for his shaggy dimwitted act and lets Steve Martin be hilariously droll as Kates boss a gray-ponytailed touchy-feely-crunchy CEO who rewards good employees with ""five minutes of uninterrupted eye contact."" Even Greg Kinnear succeeds with the thankless role of Kates love interest - a juice-store owner threatened by her companys plans. Unfortunately the one weak link here is Fey. She can do so much more with her twitchy eggheadedness as ""30 Rock"" proves. To be fair much of the reason you forget to watch her is because shes the straight woman to live-wire co-star Poehler who goes from slack-jawed blankness to silly facial expressions in a heartbeat. Its Poehlers physical shenanigans that provide the films biggest laughs but in calmer moments she actually straddles a tricky line with finesse. Given the second-act twists Angie cant seem either too stupid or too normal. In a pleasing contrast to Feys sharpness Poehler keeps her performance unpredictable and fuzzy. In this just-add-water comedy a very funny movie star is born. jneumaiernydailynews.com.

Bailey ""Baby Mama"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint No stars are born in ""Baby Mama."" Neither Tina Fey nor Amy Poehler former ""Saturday Night Live"" colleagues has a compelling big-screen presence. And as a team theyre no Martin and Lewis. Still their lightweight double act passes the time agreeably. Fey fidgety and self-deprecating plays Kate a late-30s Philadelphia executive whose life has been defined by upward mobility and waning fertility. The perks of her job as a honcho for the Round Earth organic grocery chain include a swank apartment a buttoned-down wardrobe and abundant face time with the firms CEO a sanctimonious Zen capitalist (Steve Martin in fine form). When her ob-gyn tells her shes about as likely to be fertilized as a dinosaur egg she takes matters into her own hands. Kate hires gum-chewing surrogate Angie to provide a womb with a view -- of the trailer park. A clash with her common-law husband Carl (Dax Shepard) puts Angie in Kates apartment through much of her pregnancy. Angies white-trash ways and Kates efforts to get her to conform to yuppie expectations generate predictable odd-couple complications The dim-bulb incubator parks her Doublemint underneath Kates pristine barnwood coffee table. But Angie is also savvy enough to call her employers line of unpalatable health food gunk ""for rich people that hate themselves."" A gals-night-out film such as this would be missing a major component if it lacked a romantic male lead. Greg Kinnear fills the bill as the owner of Simply Fruity a juice bar in the neighborhood Kate is scouting for the next Round Earth location. He gives the character a spiky energy that endows it with life. First-time director Michael McCullers a cowriter of the ""Austin Powers"" sequels doesnt add much flair. The film is rather dull in the way that every problem is tidily resolved by the final credits. Things come alive whenever Poehler taps into her knockabout energy; her scene on the way to the delivery room wailing and flailing like Lucille Ball briefly raises the films temperature. But there are no classic sequences and scarcely any quotable lines. ""Baby Mama"" is no miscarriage but its hardly a bundle of joy. BABY MAMA  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual humor language and a drug reference.

Baby Mama (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Baby Mama (PG-13)  Baby Mama is just amusing enough to provoke a few chuckles and just short enough to keep you from glancing at your watch. Photo K.C. Bailey Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle Miami Herald If it had been created in the spirit of anarchy found in most episodes of 30 Rock or Saturday Night Live -- i.e. written by Tina Fey instead of first-time director Michael McCullers a co-writer on the Austin Powers sequels -- Baby Mama might have been hilarious. Fey who also wrote the terrific Mean Girls seems to have plenty to say about women and their battles with modern life. As it is though Baby Mama is just amusing enough to provoke a few chuckles and just short enough to keep you from glancing at your watch. Starring former SNL stars Fey (as successful corporate executive Kate who wants a baby) and Amy Poehler (as Angie the trashy surrogate Fey hires when she proves infertile) Baby Mama is a buddy movie with a fair amount of potential full of jokes you can see coming a mile away about yuppie anxiety and redneck stupidity. Some are funny such as the notion of Sigourney Weaver as the ridiculously fertile CEO of the surrogate agency. Others are not (speech impediments ceased being a clever joke about the time of Monty Pythons Life of Brian). Worse some of the amusing bits -- Angie desperate and unable to negotiate the childproof lock on the toilet for example -- have been shown exhaustively in the trailers and have lost their punch. On paper Fey and Poehler seem a perfect odd couple; they are consistently funny performers and the idea of watching them play off each other is irresistible. On screen however hampered by a mediocre script they never quite add up to remarkable. In fact the whole premise never lives up to its potential. Im sure someone thought casting Steve Martin as a health-food magnate was a touch of genius but no matter how popular you were back in 1978 you still have to do more than wear a long white ponytail to be funny. Greg Kinnear actually does a nice job in his role as a smoothie-shop owner with whom Kate predictably falls in love but the ease of the romance keeps Baby Mama too crowd-pleasing and less crazy than it should be. Its impossible not to think of Poehler in her SNL guise as the one-legged dynamo Amber (Im rockin one leg) -- loud wild childish and completely over the top. Baby Mama couldve used a little of that bad behavior.

Bailey Baby Mama 1 / 2 Back to Gallery From start to finish a healthy pregnancy is a comic enterprise. It starts with the sex act proceeds to vomiting and methodically progresses into belly and birth-canal expansion before climaxing in a mondo explosion of primal screams body fluids and writhing. Throw in a bit of gender humor and a cranky ob-gyn and boom. Instant comedy. The funny felicitous Baby Mama exploits every stage of pregnancy except the first. No hanky-panky to bump this plot in motion. Instead we zero in on the infertility tribulations of Kate (Tina Fey) a Type A 37-year-old Philadelphia organic foods exec who has never felt the need to marry but has lately felt a strong urge to procreate. Babies everywhere have been giving her that coo-cooing mother-me look and shes desperate to accommodate them. But adoption hasnt panned out and her nine separate efforts with sperm-bank donations came up empty. It seems she has a ``t-shaped uterus the upshot of which is no bambino she has a one in a million chance of getting pregnant the doctor says. What to do? Her sister (Maura Tierney) suggests she hire a surrogate. Just implant those anonymously fertilized eggs of hers in someone elses womb. Thus arrives the bendy form of Amy Poehler as Angie a cigarette-smoking Tastykake-inhaling paragon of low-life stereotypes who looks at surrogacy as a business opportunity. So says Carl her rangy lug of a common-law husband (Dax Shepard). Despite this and him and their pointed incompatibility in all areas related to prenatal care Kate and Angie embark on their fecund new partnership with admirable good will. Soon Angie leaves Carl. Kate meets Rob (Greg Kinnear) a sweet fella who owns a smoothie shop. Angie gets Kate to loosen up a little put on a little black dress and go out clubbing. Kate gets Angie to choke back vitamins (or tries). Angie confesses her dreams. Kate confesses her jealousy ``You get to feel and experience it and I just watch. Angie joins Kate in an off-key duet of Girls Just Want To Have Fun. Kate half-heartedly accuses Angie of being ``ignorant white trash. Angie gives up Dr. Pepper. But the Kodak moments (and the nasty class pejoratives) are mercifully underplayed in this directorial debut from Austin Powers scribe Michael McCullers who seems to understand that the first duty of in comedy is - shocker - to generate laughter. The basic plot is workmanlike predictable and thin spooning out few twists beyond what youll find in the trailer but Poehler - Poehler is a plot unto herself. To call her a great physical comedian misses the contortional gift of her face alone which can back-flip from plucky compliance to the gag reflex in a single fluid motion. Shes a madwoman. Or shes made of rubber. Or shes both. Paired with this kinetic blond Gumby doll Fey is Baby Mamas decent and slightly alarmed straight woman. Her performance is a feat of restraint and not just opposite Poehler. The cast bulges with small but risible supporting turns Siobhan Fallon Hogan playing a birthing instructor with a speech impediment (``You awe stwong); Sigourney Weaver as an older woman with youthful plumbing lording it over every scene shes in; Romany Malco as a busybody doorman defining the term baby mama (n slang); and Steve Martin as Kates pony-tailed paisley-shirted boss rewarding her for a job well done with ``five minutes of uninterrupted eye contact. How much of this relates to surrogate motherhood and the knotty ethical debate surrounding it? Almost none. Theres even less of a connection here than there was say between Juno and the repercussions of teen pregnancy. The surrogacy plotline is merely a vehicle for bun-in-the-oven humor culture-clash jokes and reproductive-anatomy punchlines (spray-on Pam has its day) much of it dashed with a certain teetering absurdism. Kind of like pregnancy itself. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Open-Box Unlocked Galaxy S7 4G Android Phone for 420 + free...

"""Baby Mama"" ill-conceived | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNews""Baby Mama"" ill-conceived Pregnant with possibility yet laboured in its delivery Baby Mama is a distaff knock-off of the much funnier Knocked Up .Sigourney Weaver middle earns deadpan laughs dealing with wannabe mom Tina Fey left and surrogate Amy Poehler in Baby Mama.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. April 25 2008 Baby Mama (out of 4)Starring Tina Fey Amy Poehler Steve Martin Sigourney Weaver and Greg Kinnear. Written and directed by Michael McCullers. 98 minutes. At major theatres. PG Pregnant with possibility yet laboured in its delivery Baby Mama is a distaff knock-off of the much funnier Knocked Up.It has the same main idea as last summers comedy smash a countdown towards an unconventional pregnancy where one partner is a control freak and the other a complete slob.The twist is that both partners are straight women and the slob is the one carrying the baby. Shes surrogate mom Angie (Amy Poehler) who has agreed to hatch the fertilized eggs of mama wannabe Kate (Tina Fey) who at 37 suddenly realizes she made a mistake putting her career ahead of kids.Kate has worked her way up the ethically hewn corporate ladder of Round Earth a Philadelphia-based health food chain. Shes the fixer for a ponytailed entrepreneur (Steve Martin) who swims with dolphins and toasts pine nuts on the edge of active volcanoes. Hes pretty much a nut himself.When Kate learns shell never conceive the traditional way (""I dont like your uterus"" the doc tells her) desperation drives her into the office of a surrogate pregnancy arranger (Sigourney Weaver) and into the life of the wacky Angie.Kate and Angie arent an obvious fit even if you know and love Fey and Poehler from their Saturday Night Live antics where they used to share the Weekend Update news desk and enlivened many a sketch. Baby Mama is like one of the longer SNL bits that pads out the shows post-Update wasteland.Kate is big on organic food abstemious single living and quiet surroundings. Angie devours junk food and slurps Dr. Pepper lives common-law with a bone-headed layabout (Dax Shepard) and loves to rock the night away with the aid of numerous martinis.Logic insists theres no way Kate would so readily agree to having Angie as her surrogate especially when Angie makes it glaringly apparent shes doing it only to get her share of the 100000 arranging fee. But lets overlook this and consider the laughs of which there are about as many as the months on the road to mommyhood. As with a real pregnancy the set-up is a lot funnier than the wind-up. Fey and Poehler are gifted comics but they need good material.As the movie labours towards its telegraphed conclusion the gags about fussy Kate and farty Angie get wearisome. Naturally the two end up living together and driving each other crazy with their eccentric habits. Writer/director Michael McCullers who also hails from SNL and co-wrote the two Austin Powers sequels has a flair for absurdity but no sense of pace. He allows the film to keep crawling long after it should have learned to walk and run. Pity he didnt get Fey who penned the infinitely funnier Mean Girls to give the script a bottle and a burp.The supporting cast provides welcome relief. As the astral-tripping Round Earth founder Barry who wants to build a flagship store shaped like the seashell he found at the Toronto airport () Martin delivers one of his funniest performances in 20 years.And as surrogacy arranger Chaffee who is in no need of her own services Weaver proves adept at the deadpan humour that has often eluded her.Also providing a few well-orchestrated smiles are Greg Kinnear as the fruit smoothie salesman who just might turn this into a romance and Romany Malco as the condo doorman who also doubles as a wise-cracking busybody.Baby Mama offers ample evidence that Fey and Poehler are more than ready for prime-time screen gigs. Lets hope they team again for a comedy that delivers all that it promises.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Thats hardly the thing a gal wants to hear especially coming from her gynecologist. But thats the news 37-year- old Kate gets in ""Baby Mama"" a gentle laugh-inducing comedy starring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as a successfully ""green"" businesswoman and the urban hick she hires to carry her baby. Nixed at adoption agencies failing countless p-stick tests Kate goes to the Chaffee Bicknell agency where they ""outsource"" ahem connect hopeful parents with women wholl carry their fertilized eggs to term. After all her careful vetting of sperm donors Kate agrees to pay Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) and common-law hubby Carl (Dax Shepard) to carry her baby. Desperate times call for desperate alliances. Sigourney Weaver retrofits ever so perfectly her supercilious character from ""Working Girl"" to become Chaffee herself. She never plays the upscale Philadelphia maven at an ironic remove. Yet the jokes made at Chaffees expense are among the funniest. Written and directed by Michael McCullers ""Baby Mama"" nurses a number of contemporary issues The richest might be class. A support group for future parents and their surrogates includes a Methodist couple and their young Wiccan surrogate. No one seems particularly at ease with their arrangements. Not only is there the tension between future mom and her quasi-partner in parenthood once Angie moves into Kates orderly apartment theres the subtension of Kates company making an incursion into a transitioning Philly neighborhood. Round Earth Organic Markets founder is Barry (Steve Martin) an oozy New Age floozy who name-drops faster than the jet he no doubt flies. Martin doesnt bring much fresh to this entrepreneur with a silver ponytail. But those who chuckle at the Whole Foods ""Whole Paycheck"" nickname will appreciate the jabs. When Angie tells Barry she sees the aura of his newest store as green he adds ""As in money?"" Greg Kinnear gives a relaxed turn as Rob owner of Super Fruity a smoothie company and potential love interest for Kate. ""Baby Mama"" is often funny-wise about notions of who ""the man"" is. Rob guns for Jamba Juice though his own store suggests local demand for his offerings is muted. McCullers has penned a comedy in which hypocrisy and ethical unsteadiness get teased not lambasted. ""Baby Mama"" makes fun of the methods not the emotions behind its characters desires. Kate wants to be a mom. Angie uneducated but curious wants to get ahead in life even if it means taking advantage of Kate. For all Chaffees highfalutin riffs on ""gestation assistants"" its doorman Oscar (Romany Malco Conrad on ""Weeds"") who breaks it down for Kate ""Shes your baby mama."" The vernacular suggests orderly arrangements and contracts can get upended by crazier connections. The appealing Fey and nutty Poehler make sure ""Baby Mama"" dramas comes leavened with laughs. ""Baby Mama"" PG-13 for crude and sexual humor language and a drug reference. 1 hour 39 minutes. Written and directed by Michael McCullers; photography by Daryn Okada; starring Tina Fey Amy Poehler Greg Kinnear Dax Shepard Romany Malco Maura Tierney Holland Taylor and Sigourney Weaver.

(96 min.)The pregnancy-movie craze shows no signs of abating but not all bellies are created equal. ""Baby Mama"" is a disservice to Tina Fey who is at her best playing characters who are whip-smart. Here shes a clueless single organic-foods company executive who hires a tough-talking South Philadelphia chick played by Amy Poehler to act as a surrogate mother. Poehler is the life of the party and steals just about every scene although theres not much to steal. Greg Kinnear plays the local grocer and does his mellow Mr. Right bit.

TerrellRoman de Gare (R)Director Claude Lelouche. With Dominique Pinon Fanny Ardant Audrey Dana. (103 min.)The title of this Claude Lelouch film is meant to be ironic and refers to a popular romance novel genre - the sort sold in train stations. In fact Lelouch means to transcend the genre. He doesnt really move much beyond his usual glib panache here but the plot is intriguing and so are the actors. Dominique Pinon plays a ghost writer for a mystery novelist played by Fanny Ardant. But is he also a serial killer? Pinons foil here is a young woman played by Audrey Dana whom he meets at a gas station after shes been dumped by her boyfriend.

"A bundle of laughs from two funny women - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review A bundle of laughs from two funny women Fey and Poehler deliver in Baby Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / April 25 2008 I feel bad complaining about the current fertility trend in movies since if I werent watching women wrestle with pregnancy I would barely be able to watch them in comedies at all. The genre has been colonized by men who grant women the ability to deliver a baby but rarely a joke. So on these grounds alone ""Baby Mama"" is an unexpected triumph. Its a romantic screwball comedy about a yuppie and the woman she pays to carry her baby. The movie was written and directed by a man Michael McCullers. But it cuts out the obligatory middleman and lets two women make us laugh often very hard.Kate Holbrook (Tina Fey) is 37 and occupationally accomplished (she works as a vice president at a comical Whole Foods-ish supermarket chain in Philadelphia). But shes single childless and having a terrible time conceiving. She could keep injecting herself with hormones. She could adopt. Instead she pays an agency 100000 to find a surrogate. The search turns up Angie Ostrowski (Amy Poehler) a petite and stupendously blond slacker with bad eating habits and a dolt named Carl (Dax Shepard) for a boyfriend.An hour with Angie and I might have reconsidered the deal but Kate is intrepid. At the end of their first date Angie proposes the surrogacy and Kate eagerly almost sexily accepts saying ""Angie Im gonna put my baby inside you."" Only R. Kelly could have put it better. The ensuing trip to the fertility doctor is a montage scored to ""Endless Love"" that produces the perversely heavenly sight of Poehler swinging her legs into stirrups. The movie drums up an excuse for pregnant Angie to move into Kates apartment so the personalities can really clash and the culture farce can really get going the fastidious yuppie versus the low-class dingbat.The movie has fun outside Kates spacious Philadelphia apartment. (It looks suspiciously like a nice adult apartment on Manhattans Riverside Drive.) Romany Malco is Kates sweetly streetwise doorman. Sigourney Weaver is the hilariously fertile founder of a surrogate-parent organization (her headquarters resemble the oval office). Steve Martin has some amusing scenes as Kates kooky extra-crunchy boss - those flower-print shirts suggest hes running Trader Joes on the side. And Greg Kinnear getting sexier by the role plays the owner of a smoothie shop whos worried that Kates new store might be gentrifying the neighborhood. Here we have a slight reversal of the galling finale of ""Youve Got Mail"" where the man puts the woman he likes out of business but she loves him anyway.But the movies hook is the rapport between its two stars. They turn a classical screwball relationship upside down. Fey is Cary Grant in ""Bringing Up Baby"" stiff law-abiding humorously humorless. Poehler is Katharine Hepburn by way of Jerry Lewis. The years they spent working together on ""Saturday Night Live"" where Poehler still works have turned them into a sharply instinctive comedy duo. The uproariously uncouth people Poehler often plays are a natural affront to Feys buttoned-up professionals. Theyre roiling ids and ridiculously physical. Poehler gradually lets a human being out of Angie long enough for the characters to seem like more than a gag. But shes at her delirious best when out of physical control.""Baby Mama"" is less than a perfect movie - its shoddily assembled and McCullerss coincidence-driven script smart as it sometimes is rushes us out the door. But in this era of Apatow and Ferrell and Rogen and Wilson of men monopolizing movie comedy ""Baby Mama"" feels absurdly momentous and even political. Fey and Poehler arent just taking back control of their bodies. Theyre taking back control of their profession.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

You want a child but cant conceive. Or you dont want one and unintentionally get pregnant. Or as in Baby Mama - like Juno Knocked Up and Waitress a droll comedy where pregnancy is the situation - you cant carry to term so you hire a surrogate mother who can. These days everyone outsources. The farce stars Tina Fey as Kate a buttoned-up Philadelphia business exec with baby fever and her erstwhile Saturday Night Live partner Amy Poehler as Angie an unzipped Joisey girl. (Except for a few exterior shots Brooklyn doubles for Philadelphia.) The Einstein Sisters of comedy physics Fey and Poehler know that there is no absolute state of rest. The comic energy is all in motion Feys tension is released in Poehlers loose-limbed loopiness; Poehlers trespass of boundaries is kept in check by Feys border-patrol persona. On the evidence of their performances Fey and Poehler are positioning themselves to become the next Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy of movie comedy. Admittedly Michael McCullers script is less Trading Places than Trading Spaces with Kate bartering her bedroom for Angies womb. Their transaction resolves the class tension between the careerist yuppie and the slacker surrogate if incompletely. Perfunctorily directed by McCullers Baby Mama is best when skewering New Age entrepreneurs for what might be called Compassionate Capitalism. Steve Martin is sublime as Kates boss Barry purveyor of organic food and Zen koans. Even slyer is Sigourney Weaver as the smooth-talking director of an exclusive surrogacy clinic who cheerfully explains that a surrogate is just a prenatal nanny. In scenes more slapsticky than slapstick McCullers explicitly frames the relationship between the driven yuppie and the trash-talking trailer tramp as a nonsexual romance. Embedded in his feather-light comedy is the insight that what with assisted-reproductive technology the biological and surrogate mother form the New Age parental dyad. To be sure Kate and Angie have the obligatory male romantic interests Greg Kinnear and Dax Shepard who acquit themselves with dimpled charm. Funnier is Romany Malco (Knocked Up) as Oscar the doorman who advances the plot and becomes Angies confidant. Some films have a third-act problem; Baby Mama has a third-trimester problem. McCullers takes all the loose plot strands and ties them in a neat knot and cuts it as an obstetrician might a newborns umbilicus.

"Womb Mates washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments Movies Womb Mates PHOTOS Previous          Next Sigourney Weaver center matches Amy Poehler right as surrogate mom for Tina Fey. (By K.c. Bailey -- Universal) Tiny Fey left is a corporate VP with a ticking biological clock and Amy Poehler is hired as a surrogate mom in the warm comedy about female bonding. (By K.c. Bailey -- Universal Pictures Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 25 2008 ""Baby Mama"" isnt exactly laugh-out-loud funny. Its more quiet-chuckle funny which is fine too. This latest addition to the pregnancy comedy trend starring Tina Fey as an overachieving corporate vice president who hires a working-class party girl (Amy Poehler) to be a surrogate mother ambles along with such low-key easygoing humor that its almost a shock to the system Where are the hamburger phones the rat-a-tat pop culture references the porn? This StoryMovies Womb MatesFind Baby Mama Showtimes All have been left behind in the service of what is a far more observant if uneven comedy of 21st-century manners. As ""Baby Mama"" opens Kate Holbrook (Fey) explains how at 37 she has stopped pressing the snooze button on her biological clock and after climbing the corporate ladder of the groovy Whole Foods-like company she works for shes finally ready to reproduce. After a swiftly moving sequence wherein she discovers she possesses a T-shaped uterus and that adoption will take years she lands in the office of a surrogate pregnancy broker played by Sigourney Weaver with hilarious superciliousness. Weavers character puts Kate in touch with Angie (Poehler) a hard-edged slightly ditzy dame who has decided to rent out her womb at the advice of her loser of a common-law husband Carl (Dax Shepard). When she meets Kate Angie primly explains that she met Carl ""the summer after I discontinued high school"" and ""Baby Mama"" continues in this vein almost but not quite burying its jokes in the subtle revealing turn of the phrase. When Angie moves in with Kate ""Baby Mama"" becomes a classic odd-couple romantic comedy with the two women bickering bonding breaking up and reconciling. In a subplot Kate meets a terrific guy named Rob (Greg Kinnear) who runs a smoothie shop (he routinely rails against Jamba Juice as ""corporate juice pimps"") copes with the disapproval of her haughty mother (played by Holland Taylor at her most fabulously pompous) and manages the eccentricities of her boss a pretentious gray-ponytailed guru named Barry who says things like ""Time is love"" and ""I was just talking to Jimmy Buffett about trans fats."" Barry is portrayed by Steve Martin who like everyone else in this production makes the gratifying decision to underplay. Whereas Fey and Poehler could easily have become caricatures -- Fey ratcheting up the neuroses of her character on ""30 Rock"" for example or Poehler channeling Jaime Pressly on ""My Name Is Earl"" -- instead each actress gives her character her dignity grounding her as a recognizable human being. Even within the contrived confines of its genre ""Baby Mama"" which was written and directed by Michael McCullers rings with a certain degree of truth whether about motherhood competition or economic class. When the film reaches the inevitable confrontation in which everything goes awry Kates outburst toward Angie stings with a startling amount of venom. A very small but crucial moment within that scene is provided by Romany Malco as Kates doorman who acts as sort of a sotto voce chorus throughout the proceedings. Best known for his wonderful work on the cable show ""Weeds"" Malco embodies the kind of unforced warmth that suffuses ""Baby Mama"" and makes it such a welcome alternative to the desperation and self-loathing of the Judd Apatow canon or the compulsive verbosity of ""Juno."" This ease is even reflected in McCullerss choice to set ""Baby Mama"" in Philadelphia a stately attractive city with nothing to prove. (Which isnt to say that ""Baby Mama"" doesnt feature its share of raunch There are plenty of jokes involving sex childbirth and various and sundry lady parts.) Finally ""Baby Mama"" belongs to Fey and Poehler and the question of whether viewers will enjoy it probably comes down to how they feel about the two actresses both of whom play to their strengths here (Poehler is a far better physical comedienne especially in her facial expressions). For those who crave mannerisms and shtick and who like their jokes set up and knocked out with plenty of arrows and quote marks ""Baby Mama"" may fall as flat as one of the characters fake bellies. But audiences alive to the modest charms of its take on female friendship will be rewarded with at least a few quiet chuckles. Baby Mama (96 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor profanity and a drug reference. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Womb Mates Find Baby Mama Showtimes",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/24/AR2008042403887.html,200,babymama23,babymama,washingtonpost
"Baby Mama reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Baby Mama reviewed. Baby Mama reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 24 2008 1229 PM Womb Service Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in the surrogate-mother comedy Baby Mama. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Baby Mama click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Tina Fey (left) and Amy Poehler in Baby Mama Baby Mama (Universal) is the most disappointing movie of the year so far--which granted isnt saying a lot in mid-April. Its not as if I walked into the screening room all jazzed about the potential brilliance of Jumper or Street Kings or Drillbit Taylor. But a Tina Fey/Amy Poehler comedy about surrogate pregnancy coming at a moment when Feys career is on a stratospheric climb and popular culture is obsessed with the female reproductive system? Surely this movie was going to be funny--or at least relevant edgy and politically provocative. And given the raising of the raunchiness bar in recent comedies Baby Mama seemed likely to offer a rollicking feminist response to the ""Can you top this?"" school of guy humor. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Instead Baby Mama is a politely bland retread of womens-movie cliches a generation old the driven businesswoman who puts off motherhood till the last minute then pursues it with type-A zeal; the guy who flees a first date when babies are mentioned; the down-to-earth potential boyfriend (Greg Kinnear) who by his very existence reminds the overly ambitious heroine of what really matters in life. Look I have fond enough memories of Diane Keaton and Sam Shepard in Baby Boom but that was more than 20 years ago. Have our ideas about working parenting and the formation of alternative families really changed so little since 1987? Advertisement Part of the problem may be that Baby Mama isnt really a Tina Fey movie. Its a Michael McCullers movie written and directed by the former Saturday Night Live writer who also scripted the Austin Powers sequels. McCullers script isnt a total dud but it lacks Feys sharp social insights and his direction dips into rom-com hackdom (complete with a montage three-quarters of the way through in which the main characters mope around missing each other to the strains of a pop ballad). Kate Holbrook (Fey) is the single 37-year-old VP of a Whole Foods-like chain of organic grocery stores led by a New Age branding guru (a very funny Steve Martin). Told by a doctor who ""doesnt like [her] uterus"" (John Hodgman) that she has a one-in-a-million chance of conceiving Kate takes herself to a high-end surrogacy clinic run by Chaffee Bicknell (Sigourney Weaver) a hyperfertile 50-something whos smugly pregnant with twins. In what seems an uncharacteristically spontaneous move for such a choosy shopper Kate accepts the first candidate who comes her way Angie Ostrowski (Poehler) a blue-collar gum-snapper with a bottom-feeding common-law husband Carl (Dax Shepard in a variant on the slack-jawed yokel he played in Idiocracy). After Angie and Carl have a fight Angie packs up and moves into Kates poshly appointed apartment where tiresome high jinks ensue. Angie may or may not be faking the pregnancy. If she is knocked up the baby may not be Kates--and if it isnt she may not be willing to hand it over after the delivery. All this could have been the springboard to investigating (or wickedly satirizing) some of the issues surrounding surrogacy which as this excellent Newsweek piece reported can be a minefield for class race and gender tensions. But the conflict between Kate and Angie rarely rises above Odd Couple level Organic pea soup or Tastykakes? Touchy-feely birthing videos or American Idol karaoke? Fey and Poehler make ideal comic foils on SNL the dry brainy self-contained brunette and the saucer-eyed floppy-limbed live-wire blonde. But they cant escape the trap set by these narrowly imagined characters. Poehlers Angie in particular seems only half thought-out--a free-floating stereotype unanchored to reality. What if anything did she and Carl do for a living before the surrogacy job came along? How does she feel about the baby thats (maybe) growing in her belly? When Kate calls her ""ignorant white trash"" in a key scene why does she respond with ""I deserved that""? And when the two women finally do become friends is there any reason outside the exigencies of the script? Baby Mama is best when it playfully spoofs yuppie culture (I liked the moment at a playground when ""Remy and Cheyenne"" are summoned for their play date with ""Wingspan and Banjo""). Barry Steve Martins passive-aggressive hippie CEO gets the funniest lines by far (""I found this seashell while running barefoot through the Toronto airport""). Is it possible he wrote his own dialogue? The handsome and gifted Romany Malco whose agent should be fired for not getting him out of these flunky roles lurks around the edges of the movie as Feys observant doorman. Baby Mamas overdetermined happy ending--I wont give it away but youll know in advance anyway thanks to half a dozen cues--does the movies theme a disservice by copping out on the whole notion of alternative family (a condescending term in itself but thats another matter). As in Knocked Up what at first appears to be at least a mildly subversive vision of sexual politics soon reverts to an endorsement of heterosexual and biological norms. For all the methods weve invented of making babies--in test-tubes with turkey basters in the wombs of other women or even transmen--Hollywood still prefers its leading ladies to put a rock on their finger and push one out the old-fashioned way.

Kate a successful businesswoman wants the baby she never had time for but her bodys not cooperating. Angie not very successful at anything really can have a baby - and gets herself hired out by a snooty spacey surrogate agency to have Kates. That in a nutshell is Baby Mama. There is a somewhat satisfying dramatic twist somewhere around the middle but for the most part the film is as predictable as that brief description makes it sound. Its also hilarious laugh-out-loud funny. That its more a series of sketches some of which are revisited throughout the film isnt necessarily a slight; the same is true of movies like Animal House and Caddyshack and you dont hear anyone complaining about their lack of plot all these years later. That this is the structure of the film is also not a surprise because its a vehicle for several Saturday Night Live veterans including its stars - Tina Fey who plays Kate and Amy Poehler who plays Angie. Fey who created and stars in NBCs 30 Rock - the funniest show on television - is best when shes the overly rational eye in the hurricane of unhinged characters. And although she neither wrote nor directed Baby Mama - Michael McCullers another SNL veteran handled both chores - thats where she finds herself here. Kate is the vice president of an organic-food company founded by a New Age nut case played with gusto by Steve Martin. Kates T-shaped uterus wont allow her to conceive so she visits a surrogate agency founded by Chaffee Bicknell an unusually fertile older woman (Sigourney Weaver also top-notch). The agency helps Kate find Angie who ""discontinued high school"" and is stuck with a low-rent money-grubbing common-law husband named Carl (Dax  Shepard whose first role as ""vomiter at party"" in 1998s Hairshirt is fitting in a good way). Angie and Kates lifestyles clash particularly after Angie moves into Kates apartment. To say that each teaches the other important lessons about whats missing in their lives again makes Baby Mama sound trite and maybe it is. Who cares? Its too funny for that to matter. Fey and Poehler are terrific together their relationship the heart of the film. Baby Mama is at its best when they are in Kates apartment arguing fighting bonding whatever. Some of the throwaway jokes the little asides in their scrappy banter are the funniest things about the movie. Their delivery - Poehlers in particular - makes even the most-sitcom-ish situations genuinely funny. When theyre joined by Oscar (Romany Malco) Kates friendly doorman its even better. Greg Kinnear shows up as Rob the bemused owner of the Super Fruity smoothie store in the neighborhood Kate chooses for her companys next store. Yes their relationship also is predictable. But hes funny too. So it goes with Baby Mama. The humor outweighs the holes in the story Fey and Poehler look to be a comedy team built to last - lets hope so - and those who find Judd Apatows comedies lacking in decent female roles (present company excluded; see Forgetting Sarah Marshall for evidence to the contrary) have found their film. A successful delivery all the way round. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Baby Mama | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; baby-mama ) Baby Mama (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli It has become a time-honored tradition that stars of Saturday Night Live upon graduating from the no-longer-funny late night show elect to spread their wings and strive for cinematic greatness. With a few notable exceptions most have crashed and burned in forgettable fashion to never be heard from again or to become the punch lines of jokes that are generally as funny as the ones they told during their SNL tenure. Baby Mama is the first SNL-inspired movie to star two female members of the ensemble Tina Fey who has been doing nicely for herself since leaving and her gal-pal Amy Poehler whos still on. While Baby Mama manages to avoid the pit of awfulness into which many of its predecessors have sunk it achieves nothing more impressive than mediocrity. Its genial but stale and neither side-splittingly hilarious nor painfully unfunny. In short its like a great many cinematic comedies that recycle comfortable plots and dont try anything daring. Kate (Fey) is a Philadelphia working girl - a woman who has put her personal life to one side so she can concentrate on climbing the corporate ladder of the organic grocery store chain where she is employed. Her boss a new age hippie type named Barry (Steve Martin) likes her aura and decides to make her a V.P. thus rewarding all her hard work. But Kate hears the maternal clock ticking and decides she wants to have a baby. With no husband and a uterus that has a 1-in-1 million chance of producing an infant she elects to go the surrogate mother route. So she pays high tech fertility magnate Chaffee Bicknell (Sigourney Weaver) 100000 to find her the perfect woman to warm her bun in the oven. The choice is the white trashy Angie (Amy Poehler) who does all the things an expectant mother shouldnt do drinks smokes eats junk food and watches bad TV. When she breaks up with her boyfriend Carl (Dax Shepard) she moves in with Kate and they become a female Odd Couple. Further complicating Kates life is that she has fallen for Rob (Greg Kinnear) a guy who runs a smoothy shop in the neighborhood where shes planning to open a new store. One thing positive to say about Baby Mama is that it doesnt try too hard for its laughs. For the most part the humor is low key so that when a joke fails (something that happens with regularity) its not as obvious as in more in-your-face comedies. The movie does occasionally get silly (as when Angie cant figure out how to open the child-proofed toilet and pees in the sink) but it generally stays far away from the over-the-top territory where Will Ferrell has pitched his tent. The screenplay for Baby Mama has its share of amusing moments but few viewers are likely to leave theaters with aching sides. Baby Mama is essentially a buddy movie although the trajectory of its formula is one commonly associated with romantic comedies. The two protagonists cant stand each other when they first meet gradually bond and come to care for each other are divided as a result of contrived complications and reunite for the happy ending. (Lest readers be misled by this comparison theres nothing romantic in the friendship of Kate and Angie - they both have male love interests.) The sense of dA(c)jA  vu is because the storyline is familiar and writer/director Michael McCullers making his directorial debut after being a SNL scribe during the late 90s doesnt do a lot with it that could be considered interesting or original. Tina Fey has a warm and likeable presence and this is her first legitimate opportunity to show it off on the big screen. Not surprisingly she and Amy Poehler display excellent chemistry and thats part of what makes Baby Mama work more than what one might expect from the plot description. Greg Kinnear provides a pleasant non-threatening addition to the cast. Steve Martin however is probably around for too long. He takes what might have been amusing as a one-joke cameo and drags it out over several appearances until its no longer funny. Maura Tierney is underused but based on her recent work she must be getting used to reasonably high billing for someone who doesnt get more than a handful of lines. Several SNL regulars (Will Forte and Fred Armisen) show their faces in inconsequential roles. As is often true with comedies all the best jokes are in the trailer so those who have seen it have absorbed the best Baby Mama has to offer at least in the humor department. Fey and company do their best to provide an emotional component to the production but as with many films that rely too much on the familiar the characters never seem more than half-formed and this stints our ability to appreciate their limited arcs. Theres nothing terribly wrong with Baby Mama but its probably better suited for viewing on television where many of the participants cut their teeth. This is small screen stuff masquerading as something bigger.

Whats disappointing is that the woman in question - a baby-craving career woman named Kate - is played by Tina Fey the brilliant and appealing star of ""30 Rock"" and former head writer for ""Saturday Night Live"" in her first movie lead. Surely if Fey herself had written ""Baby Mama"" tonights mediocre opening attraction at the Tribeca Film Festival (it hits theaters Friday) this mild cross between ""Baby Boom"" and ""The Odd Couple"" would not be so crushingly predictable. Id like to think it would have more edge and would not base its laughs so heavily on caricaturing the other main character - a working-class surrogate mom named Angie played by Amy Poehler - who is described as ""white trash"" by Kate in the flicks most cringe-worthy moment. Fey and Poehler who worked together on ""SNL"" have considerable comic chemistry as the career woman and the surrogate mother she hires. The latter abruptly becomes Kates roommate after Angie walks out on her common-law husband (Dax Shepard). Too bad that debuting writer-director Michael McCullers (who used to work under Fey as a writer) has provided them with such lame barbs far too many of which revolve around Kates horror at Angies predilection for junk food. With virtually nothing in the way of visual or physical comedy there are more chuckles here than belly laughs and most of them are delivered by the supporting cast. Steve Martin is a hoot as Kates ponytailed New-Agey boss at a Whole Earth-like company who chooses Kate to supervise the opening of a new flagship store in Philadelphia (the films ostensible setting though most of it was filmed in New York). Sigourney Weaver also steals scenes as the impossibly fertile 50-something who heads the agency that hooks up Kate and Angie in the first place. Faring less well is poor Greg Kinnear as Kates nominal love interest who runs a juice bar and um sets up the climax. Considering he ran a coffee shop in his last movie Kinnear may want to find a new agent. Even Romany Malco as Kates requisite wisecracking doorman gets better lines. Pregnant with possibilities ""Baby Mama"" wants too badly to be loved to take any chances. Men who are coerced into seeing this chick flick may feel like theyve been attached to an estrogen drip. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next BORN-AGAIN ECOIST Read Next BORN-AGAIN ECOIST Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 63425 How Hillary blew her big moment 31103 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 21143 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

By Anthony Lane Tina Fey and Amy Poehler in a movie directed by Michael McCullers.   Credit TOM BACHTELL With many film stars jumping back into television--and who can blame them since that is where you find the better scripts these days--it is heartening to see someone make the leap in the other direction. Tina Fey currently of ""30 Rock"" throws herself into ""Baby Mama"" with a will. She plays Kate Holbrook thirty-seven years old vice-president of development at the Round Earth food company and childless. To fill this gap in her resume she pays for a surrogate mother Angie (Amy Poehler) who not only carries Kates fertilized eggs but in an even more intimate gesture moves into her apartment having nowhere else to go. Whats more each has a man to deal with. Angie has Carl (Dax Shepard) whose infinite love for her is proved by his license plate (""MYGRLROX"") and Kate finds Rob (Greg Kinnear) the funny sensitive yet so not gay proprietor of the Super Fruity juice store. But hey this is a film about pregnancy. Youll never guess how it ends. Not that predictability weighs against a film. What counts is not the well-tried grid of the narrative but the kick of energy that you send through it and for a while ""Baby Mama"" written and directed by Michael McCullers feels low on surge. As Kate lays out her life in voice-over (""Some women got pregnant. I got promotions"") the patness of the lines suggests that we are in for a well-meaning slightly whiny issue movie; whereupon McCullers changes issues and saves the day. Forget the title the target audience and the taglines what fuels ""Baby Mama"" is not the eternal quest for motherhood or the topical conflict between parenting and careers but an old-fashioned scuffle over class. Nothing places us on the social scale as accurately as our child-rearing and one shot of kids being called across a sunlit playground--""Time for your playdate with Wingspan and Banjo""--summons a world of liberal cuteness. Clean-living and high-earning Kate markets gloopy green soup and other organic treasures to the discerning. Angie ""That crap is for rich people who hate themselves."" Oof. Much of the film boils down to Poehler and Fey hanging out and jousting and connoisseurs of oddness may glimpse the ghosts of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau looking on with twitches and grouches of approval. Angie is skinny to Kates curves loose-tongued to her zipped-up sense of fun fertile to her barren jealousy. Angie wears pedal pushers and tank tops whereas Kate stalks around bare-legged in skirts that lurch to a halt two inches above the knee which is a length that Christy Turlington would struggle to carry off. Its possible that Fey like other television stars is unused to being framed in full length and though in complete command of her delivery--dry spiky but unthreatening--she hasnt yet made up her mind how funny her body is meant to be. She isnt big enough to make a joke of her ripeness like Bette Midler but shes no Lily Tomlin either. She could do worse than steal a trick from Lucille Ball--a lovely elegant figure who taught herself to be graceless. Mind you no one could claim that ""Baby Mama"" is a thing of beauty. It looks cheap shiny and bereft of depth and McCullers hasnt shaken off the horrible habit shared by most modern comedy directors of covering up cracks and doldrums in the story by playing pop either chirpy or teary over a montage of uninspiring images. Yet there are gags and scraps of action that give the movie fits of buoyancy and these tend to come not so much from the younger eager performers as from the old hands. If you want to see scene-stealing turned into grand larceny watch Sigourney Weaver as the owner of the surrogacy service or better still Steve Martin as the presiding genius of Round Earth. Hand the guy a thick hank of ponytail relieve him of the burden of a central role aim him squarely at the bulls-eye of eco-smugness (""Ive toasted pine nuts on the edge of an active volcano"") and you find him happier onscreen than I have seen him in years. Who cares whose baby is inside which mother when the laughs come from the grown man doing business with his inner child? There was a time when as a God-fearing member of the community you could commit a single murder drop a couple of clues and wait to be unmasked. Now its all serial slayers stacking up bodies like air miles. Filmgoers are supposed to find this multiplicity enticing and we are constantly being invited to enter into the ""mind"" of the serial killer but in truth there is no drabber place to be and the idea that there might be an artfulness even a style to the act of homicide is one of the more pernicious fantasies that movies like to hawk. Two new films pursue this folly one less annoyingly than the other. In ""Roman de Gare"" directed by Claude Lelouch everyone is driven to trade one self for another. The crime writer Judith Ralitzer (Fanny Ardant) is not we come to realize responsible for writing her best-selling books. As for the diminutive Pierre (Dominique Pinon) he is either her ghostwriter or her secretary; then again he could be a serial rapist and killer whose escape from prison is announced on French radio or perhaps the errant husband reported missing by Florence (Michele Bernier). Whatever the case he is asked by Huguette (Audrey Dana) whom he meets at a gas station to pose as her fiance for the sake of a trip to her parents. She is a hairdresser although she might be a hooker; and so on until our certainties are frazzled and frayed away. The air of mystery here is appealing because the secrets behind it seem to matter both a great deal and not at all--rather like love which has been Lelouchs subject ever since he made ""A Man and a Woman"" forty-two years ago and which is of minimal consequence to everyone but the lovers themselves. The problem with ""Roman de Gare"" however is that the tale grabs you more than the telling. Pierre does magic tricks and Lelouch following suit shuffles his plotlines like marked cards but his blitheness has a habit of turning slack and too many scenes outstay their welcome as if he had decided to toy with the rules of crime fiction without deigning to show that he could if pressed obey them. By the end--which true to form feels cheerful but insubstantial--the film is relying on the charms of its cast. Dana is a real find (you try playing a cigarette-powered harpy while managing to drift like smoke into the audiences affection) and Pinon best known here for his cultish work in ""Delicatessen"" (1991) and ""Alien Resurrection"" (1997) is a one-man fairy tale--startling proof that you can look like a frog and still wind up as somebodys chosen prince. The strongest performance comes from a rural pig which emits a rush of unbearable squeals as it is slaughtered. Thankfully this occurs off-camera although whether it means that our friend the serial killer is back in business or simply that dinner will soon be on the table I cannot say. The best thing about ""88 Minutes"" is the title. Jon Avnets movie bumbles along for twenty minutes at which point Dr. Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) is informed by a gravelly phone call that he has eighty-eight minutes to live. We then switch into real time and the countdown begins allowing us to calibrate precisely how much more of the film we have to suffer through. Avnet is setting a noble example here if all movies were named after their running times Hollywood would instantly become a brisker place. Would Peter Jackson have dared to put us through a Tolkien trilogy called ""Nine and a Quarter Hours of Elves""? I dont think so. Gramm is a forensic psychiatrist who majors in serial killers. A nutcase (Neal McDonough) is in jail awaiting execution yet crimes identical to his are being perpetrated on the outside and Gramm who testified against him is being simultaneously framed and hunted down. What follows makes absolutely no sense--a buzzing fidgety mess of bad cinema with people barking inquiries over their cell phones instead of enjoying what used to be called conversation. There is no basis for the criminal motives no excuse for the slavering closeups of sadism wielded against women and no reason that Pacino should have paused before feeding the script into his shredder. I sense a weariness in his features--an insomnia of the soul as it were--that has nothing to do with his character and everything I suspect to do with his feelings for an industry that can pay him good money to prop up junk. Compare ""88 Minutes"" with ""Sea of Love"" another murder mystery that Pacino made in 1989 and you find him sporting the same loud ties but everything else has leached away suspense credibility wit and the lost art of flirtation. As a result nothing would give me keener pleasure than to reveal the identity of the killer but a day after seeing the film I have genuinely forgotten. It was either a man or a woman but beyond that everything is a blur. ""Its my job to be convincing"" Dr. Gramm explains. Sorry Doc. Youre fired.

A tailor-made girls night out movie ""Baby Mama"" is a tidily wrapped package the contents of which you can easily guess before opening it. Bigscreen teaming of longtime ""Saturday Night Live"" cohorts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as two women brought together through a dubious surrogate pregnancy employs both broad gags and mild wit in telling an exceedingly predictable tale designed to push recognition buttons with thirtysomething women to likely sweetly profitable results. The role of Kate Holbrook a bright accomplished and attractive career woman who feels a sudden need to have a baby seems so perfectly suited for Fey that it will be widely assumed that she wrote the script herself as she did for ""Mean Girls."" In fact pic reps the handiwork of writer and first-time helmer Michael McCullers a co-scenarist on the two ""Austin Powers"" sequels who worked with Fey Poehler and producer Lorne Michaels on ""Saturday Night Live"" some years back. Along with the pregnancy angle a source of interlaced anxiety and humor pic looks for most of its laughs in the ""Odd Couple""-ish forced cohabitation of Kates ultra-confident uber-yuppie and Angie (Poehler) a trailer-trash vulgarian Kate finds to carry her baby upon learning shes got little chance of conceiving on her own. Unfortunately far too much of this culture clash is expressed through cheap gags such as Angies preference for junk over health food and her sticking gum underneath Kates coffee table. Happily some of the scripts tributary branches prove more fertile than the core. Kate patronizes a top-of-the-line surrogacy center whose owner (Sigourney Weaver) stirs intense envy and wonderment in her clients by continuing to be abundantly reproductive even in her late 50s. Even better the owner of Round Earth the health food grocery chain where Kate is a top executive is inventively played by Steve Martin as a long-haired new age guru with eccentric business habits and communication techniques (such as placing foreheads together to foster mutual understanding) that are nuttily funny without tipping into the absurd. Kates present project is launching a new store in a borderline Philadelphia neighborhood an occupation that neatly dovetails with the interests of local juice bar owner Rob (Greg Kinnear). While the latter role is by nature dully functional providing Kate with dating material while her baby is growing in someone else Kinnear invests the attractive fellow with just enough scruffiness skepticism and unruly backstory to make him a welcome presence. Thesps and the generally congenial mood make ""Baby Mama"" go down easily enough with the major caveats that the two major plot twists (or perhaps bumps best applies here) are plainly visible from miles away and that McCullers eagerness to please results in a story with not a single rough edge or lingering issue. The world on view here has not a speck of dirt or difficulty left in it once the plot entanglements are sorted out. Fey is a delight to watch throughout. Able to convey Kates intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient perfectionist side become overbearing. A fine foil and partner for her co-star through long experience Poehler is a bit more scattershot in her effectiveness due to Angies sometimes overdrawn coarseness her misguided motives and her alliance with a bottom-feeder mate (an amusing Dax Shepard). Some additional laughs come courtesey of Romany Malco as a sometimes overly helpful doorman Holland Taylor as Kates acerbic mother and Siobhan Fallon Hogan as a birthing class teacher with a wild accent that channels early Marlene Dietrich. Although shot mostly in New York pic picks up some added freshness via Philadelphia streets locations. Craft contributions are handsome although Jeff Richmonds score veers towards on-cue preciousness.
