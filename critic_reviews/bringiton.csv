Comments Bring It On Just before a major cheerleading competition the San Diego Toros cheerleaders for a lousy high school football team discover their entire repertoire has been copied from a rival squad the East Compton Clovers. To save their reputation the Toros hire a choreographer who reverently describes cheerleading as a retarded form of dance and their new captain recruits a far-from-perky transfer student and gymnast to fill a vacancy created by injury. This earnest and arch story--so fast paced its formulas are wonderfully obscured--has an adolescent energy and a tempered sexuality and its infused with the moral agenda of a warmly didactic sitcom. Leads Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku are radiant the rest of the cast self-consciously cartoonish and emotive. Peyton Reed directed a screenplay by Jessica Bendinger; with Jesse Bradford and Gabrielle Union. 98 min.

As pure a bubble gum movie as can be imagined in this cynical age ""Bring It On"" routinely tries to make heroes of cheerleaders the most mocked of high school groups. Conceived to find a new angle in cheerleading subculture pic is actually part of a trend following the slightly naughty ""But Im a Cheerleader"" and the bump-and-grind antics in ""The Replacements."" Its also part of a larger tendency this year toward tales of eager innocent youth who could easily exist in the Eisenhower era. Whether target teen aud is finally tired of trends and whether Kirsten Dunst has nascent star appeal will be tested. Expect barely passing grades. There are hints here and there of a more devilish sense of humor in Jessica Bendingers script in which cheerleading squads -- one from the rich white San Diego burbs another from poor black East Compton -- battle like sports teams for the national cheerleading competish crown. Sense of edginess appears before opening credits as Torrance (Dunst) has a Busby Berkeley-styled nightmare in which she loses her top during a goofy squad routine which includes lines like ""I swear were not whores"" (Bit is marred though by glimpse of Dunsts strapless bra when shes supposedly lost her top.) Its all part of Torrances anxiety about being selected captain of Rancho Carne High Toros cheer squad -- reigning national champs -- in wake of departing topper Big Red (Lindsay Sloane) and Torrances cheerleader b.f. Aaron (Richard Hillman) whos thrilled to be attending Cal State Dominguez Hills. Torrance wins the election against bitchy rivals Courtney (Clare Kramer) and Whitney (Nicole Bilderback) while having domestic battles with snotty younger bro Justin (Cody McMains). After a squad member breaks her leg tepidly comic audition for a replacement leads to recruiting above-it-all but highly skilled transfer student Missy (Eliza Dushku) whod rather be doing gymnastics if school only offered sport (a dubious problem given Rancho Carnes affluence). Torrance locks eyes with Missys outsider-type bro Cliff (Jesse Bradford) but her heart remains with Aaron even as hes cheating on her at Dominguez Hills. First big crisis occurs when Missy storms out of practice telling Torrance that the Toros routine is a total rip-off of one by the East Compton High Clovers led by smart competitive Isis (Gabrielle Union). A visit to Clovers campus convinces Torrance that ""my entire cheerleading career has been a lie""; unable to convince her squad to drop the routine Torrance and Co. are humiliated at a game by Isis and her Clovers who make a surprise appearance. Comic tone moves in two jarring directions care of tyro helmer Peyton Reed Theres the sweet side shown in a nice wordless scene between Torrance and Cliff brushing their teeth together in a kind of hygienic flirt and theres the broad side typified by appearance of cheer squad coach-guru Sparky (Ian Roberts) a Bob Fosse wannabe who terrorizes the squad and leads to a scandal at the regional championships. Realizing shes been conned by Big Red Aaron and Sparky spunky Torrance pushes her team to come up with a whole new routine in two weeks before the nationals aired by ESPN2 in Daytona. Thoroughly unconvincing conflicts with Cliff lead to further complications but theyre smoothed over like lip gloss by the time trophies are handed out. Pic succeeds in displaying the physical drive and demands of cheerleading underlining it with the irony that the Toros squad is way better at what it does than their Clippers-like football team. Reed and editor Larry Bock miss a golden opportunity to make the turns flips and dance steps into something kinetically thrilling as if too much style would mar pics rather plain-wrap look. Still closing contest between Toros and Clovers reps a close facsimile of real thing which is aired annually on ESPNs sister network. In a disappointing comic turn after her mysterious persona in ""The Virgin Suicides"" Dunst cant really hold pic together showing too much thesping sweat in her efforts to make Torrance likable. Poor chemistry with Bradford is another key flaw; for a guy with some apparent attitude and deep thinking Bradfords Cliff is rendered nearly blank onscreen. Dushku leaves a strong impression as does the charismatic Union whom the camera loves. Lensing and other tech credits lack some of the color and zap that would have given teen fantasy a bubbly look.

(Universal) May God forgive me but I liked ""Bring It On."" Actually kind of sort of loved it - not in an unequivocal way mind you (there are far too few people with pimples for one thing) but infinitely more than I ever thought possible considering its a movie about . . . cheerleading. Yes cheerleading that perky peppy rah-rah extracurricular activity that is fashionable for the hip or those aspiring to be hip to hate. Whod have thought that competitive cheerleading - not what you see on the sidelines of a game (thats rehearsal for the main event) but rigorously scored cutthroat national contests involving gymnastic athleticism hot dance moves and high school girls in short skirts - could be so darn thrilling? And have I mentioned that the film is funny? Not tee-hee oh-how-droll funny but bwa-ha-HA I-just-blew-Sprite-through-my-nostrils funny. The tart taut script by first-time screenwriter Jessica Bendinger is stuffed with such deliciously mean dialogue as this acidic exchange between a disgruntled cheerleader and Sparky Polastri (catty cut-up Ian Roberts) a hired-gun choreographer recruited at the last minute to whip the Rancho Carne High School pep squad into shape Whiny cheerleader ""Why does everybody have to go on a diet?"" Sparky (with that duh look on his face) ""Because were cheerleaders. We throw people in the air. And fat people dont go as high."" Or this Sparkified bon mot to another er callipygian (look it up) team member ""Nice overall physique. Now report that compliment to your [derriere] before it gets so big it forms its own Web site."" The plot is fairly simple When lily-white suburban California pep squad captain Torrance (likable Kirsten Dunst) discovers that her five-time national champion teams routines were unwittingly ripped off from the East Compton Clovers a bumpin black squad from inner-city L.A. led by Isis (regal Gabrielle Union) Torrance has to scramble to come up with a fresh set of killer moves in the weeks before the national finals. Against this beat-the-clock backdrop our button-nosed heroine meets and begins to fall for cute Cliff (Jesse Bradford) an apathetic punk rocker who has the good taste to listen to the Clash the Cramps and the Ramones (""How vintage"" chirps Torrance) and to loathe everything associated with teen/team spirit. As Torrances unlikely ally in her quest for a sixth trophy Cliffs equally disaffected sister Missy (Eliza Dushku) provides moral support and a healthy dose of cynicism about the ultimate meaninglessness of cheerleading in the cosmic balance book. Missys the balsamic vinegar to Torrances extra virgin olive oil. Without her sweetly sour outlook on life and love to keep things in perspective ""Bring It On"" might easily have become just another ""Shes All That."" What makes the film go down easy with the anti-cheer faction is the groundwork of bemused skepticism laid by writer Bendinger and coolly maintained by director Peyton Reed a relative newcomer to features whose detached eye and experience in documentaries music videos and the brilliant HBO alt-comedy show ""Mr. Show With Bob amp; David"" has obviously served him well. Most refreshing of all is ""Bring It Ons"" depiction of todays teenage population. Honest and at times unflattering in its portrayal of the first geeky stirrings of puppy love and in its unflinching vision of the back-stabbing cruelty that makes high school hell for most people the movie spends only as much time as is necessary pandering to adolescent hormones. As a bonus theres even a well-rounded sympathetic gay character and the slight undercurrent of homophobia that runs through the movie is limited to the circle of dumb football jocks whose losing streak is the butt of even more jokes. Of course theres the ubiquitous teenage movie sex drive. But although the kids here are acknowledged as having erotic lives theyre not simply pictured as smaller but equally sophisticated versions of adults. The biological imperative to get lucky is actually portrayed as secondary to the drive to excel at something worthwhile and better yet when it comes to playing fair to do the right thing.

Handout Navel Maneuvers / Cheerleader comedy `Bring It On shows its stomachs not its brains 1 / 2 Back to Gallery BRING IT ON Comedy. Starring Kirsten Dunst Eliza Dushku Jesse Bradford Gabrielle Union. Directed by Peyton Reed. (PG-13. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The cute kids of Rancho Carne High School in suburban San Diego really know how to be bitchy and still perform complicated acrobatic routines stolen from a rival team at an African American high school in Los Angeles. Thats the screechy fleshy and feisty world of high school cheerleading as depicted with navels flashing in the lousy but spirited new comedy ""Bring It On"" opening today at Bay Area theaters. This movie ought to come with a warning Dont try these stunts at home -- or at school -- or you might be shunned by your family and the rest of society. Cheerleading is its own strange bubbly society. And thats one thing ""Bring It On"" makes amusingly clear as Kirsten Dunst playing new squad captain Torrance Shipman tries to keep her snotty crew of generally blond cheerfolk in the running to repeat as national cheerleading champions. The Rancho Carne Toros have won five years straight and theyve been featured on ESPN -- 15 minutes of fame that have made them the toast of their suburb. Their rivals the Clovers from tough East Compton High School have never been on TV and theyre mad. Theyre even angrier that the Toros clandestinely recorded Clover routines on video then copied them in every detail to win their championships. Its a story of bitter rivalry with lots of booty-wiggling. Hollywood feeds on such things. Theres nothing terribly wrong with ""Bring It On"" other than its jumbled and stupid plot bad acting and a few predictable gags that fall flat such as the cheerleaders crashing during their routines. Oh and just in case little kids are watching theres a fart joke and a barf joke. But ""Bring It On"" does have a few things going for it. The biggest is a buoyant upbeat style that while short of being infectious at least doesnt cause an instant stupor the way so many movies do. Another plus is Dunst. This actress is willing to be as silly and cloyingly agreeable as it takes to get through a slapdash film. And shes not afraid to show a lot of navel. In fact the navel is almost part of Torrance Shipmans irritatingly gleeful personality as she flaunts it everywhere like a second smile. Politically incorrect as it may seem to some ""Bring It On"" shows a lot of wiggling gyrating young (mostly female) bodies. Sorry but cheerleaders do wiggle and gyrate. Some of the characters are a bit like old-fashioned go-go girls and high- energy go-go girls at that. When ruffled they flip each other the bird. Displays of flesh and audacious suggestiveness as well as bird flipping are allowable under the vague guidelines of the PG-13 rating. Torrance faces a challenge once shes named captain of the cheerleading team. The schools football team has the worst record in the league so its up to the cheerleaders to bring honor to the campus. When it is learned that a previous captain had been teaching stolen routines Torrance has to come up with new ones. She talks the squad into hiring a professional choreographer who turns out to be a maniacal jazz dance twit (actually one of the films funniest developments). That fails so the Toros have to devise their own routine for competition. The story is 90 percent skewed toward the white (except for one Asian) suburban kids at Rancho Carne and away from the black kids of East Compton whose back story of struggling to get noticed is way more interesting. The Compton kids led by the resolute Isis (Gabrielle Union) play a major role as the rivals if only a minor one in actual screen time. But as one character says ""This is not a democracy its a cheerocracy.""

"Bring It On | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bring-it-on ) Bring It On (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Filmmakers are clearly running low on subject matter for sports movies. Somehow however that doesnt stop the projects from being greenlighted so over the years just about every sport or pseudo-sport has been used as the subject of one of these films. And while its a stretch to call cheerleading a ""sport"" (despite a ""fact sheet"" published by Universal Pictures arguing the contrary) it slides as neatly into the formula as ice skating gymnastics or dancing. The difference with this film and the reason it occasionally qualifies as a guilty pleasure is the approach of director Peyton Reed who is making his feature debut after years of television work. Reed never takes the material too seriously and there are stretches when he has his tongue planted firmly in his cheek. Although there are instances when the humor is overt Reed predominantly relegates his satirical edge to a low-key background element - he has a great deal of fun toying with the characters and their situations. The screenplay credited to Jessica Bendinger is full of painfully trite dialogue; Reed gets his actors through some of these scenes by creating a self-consciousness about the silliness of the lines theyre saying. (Two examples ""My entire cheerleading career has been a lie"" ""Cheerleaders are dancers who have gone retarded."") Alas Reeds creativity doesnt extend to all aspects of his film and thats where the generically titled Bring It On gets into trouble. As with all sports movies theres a competition to be won or lost. However as it is presented in this movie theres no tension or suspense about whos going to emerge victorious. In fact winning seems irrelevant. Its not a big thing for the director the characters or by extension the audience. Even openly campy parodies of the genre such as Strictly Ballroom offer a climax with more energy and spark than the lackluster finish of Bring It On. No matter how enjoyable other elements of the movie might be the ending leads to an inevitable sense of dissatisfaction. Bring It On is set in San Diegos Rancho Carnie High School where the football team is a laughingstock but the cheerleading squad has won five consecutive national championships. Now under their new captain career cheerleader Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) theyre going for title 6. When a member of the team breaks her leg Torrance holds tryouts to replace her. The winner is a transfer student to Rancho Carnie a gymnast named Missy (Eliza Dushku) who is dubious about cheerleading but willing to try because the school doesnt have a gymnastics program. Everything seems to be going fine until Missy clues Torrance into a dirty little secret - Rancho Carnies routine has been stolen from that of a rival school. Now with time running out before the Regionals the Rancho Carnie Toros are forced with the unenviable choice of learning an entirely new program or facing public embarrassment when they do the same routine as the East Compton Clovers. For his cast Reed has selected a group of appealing young actors and actresses. Rising star Kirsten Dunst (recently seen in the anemic Drop Dead Gorgeous and the infinitely better The Virgin Suicides) may have gotten this job based solely on her flat stomach dimples and perky attitude. Co-star Eliza Dushku whose biggest movie role to date was as Arnold Schwarzeneggers daughter in True Lies (but who is best known for her recurring role as Faith in TVs Buffy the Vampire Slayer) is equally easy on the eyes. Ditto for Jesse Bradford who plays the male love interest. However while all of the girls on the cheerleading team are physically fit they also appear to be borderline-anorexic. Im not sure what kind of message this is sending if its sending one at all but there is a point at which girls who are too skinny lose their attractiveness and more than one player in Bring It On has crossed that line. The movie wants to appeal to both sides of the gender gap. For girls its intended to be a story about empowerment featuring a female-dominated activity with strong characters. For boys theres the jiggle factor. Bring It On is designed as a Tamp;A movie with a PG-13 rating which means that theres plenty of Tamp;A only its all covered by clothing. Even though the actresses are 18 or older the intended audience is not so bare flesh is confined to the belly button region legs and feet. This wouldnt get the Russ Meyer seal of approval. As seen through the directors slightly skewed vision Bring It On is more watchable than one might expect from a motion picture with such an overused and ridiculous premise but theres only so much Reed can do with the material. The pictures last half hour drags interminably; although the choreography of the competition routines is technically proficient theres no evidence of real energy or enthusiasm in these sequences. In the final analysis while Bring It On can boast occasional bursts of freshness and ingenuity the experience as a whole doesnt offer enough of these to earn a recommendation.

(Universal) Lets put our pompoms together and give it up for Americas spunkiest species for those wonderful boys and girls who put the rah in rah-rah-rah. Seriously isnt it time we overcame our jealousies and misconceptions and gave the nations cheerleaders a group hug? Thats the intent behind ""Bring It On"" a spoofy paean to cheerfolk that has more bounce per flounce than most tales about teen queens football heroes and pining outsiders. Though it shares a biting undertone with last years high school satire ""Election"" the movie takes a sunnier more affectionate look at those most likely to succeed. The movie gets off to a saucy start when a squad captained by the effervescent Torrance (Kirsten Dunst) launches into a haughty chant that confirms our worst opinions ""Im sexy. Im cute. Im popular to boot. Im bitching. Great hair. The boys all like to stare. Im pretty. Im cool. I dominate this school"" they chime. Set in suburban San Diegos Rancho Carne High School (thats Meat Ranch High School in espanol) the story mines the ruthlessly catty athletically demanding world of competitive cheerleading. The Toro squad is on its way to a sixth consecutive national championship when disaster strikes The cheerleaders discover that all of their innovative hip-hop routines were borrowed from the Clovers a squad from Los Angeles East Compton High. With only three weeks left before the nationals Torrance insists that the Toros come up with new routines. Though met with resistance she soon lets potential mutineers know whos running the show. ""This is not a democracy its a cheerocracy"" she snaps. (Not that Dunst while adorable quite convinces the audience.) When inspiration fails her Torrance hires a fascistic choreographer (Ian Roberts) to develop and teach the Toros a new routine. The decision is disastrous for the squad but the movie profits from Robertss fleeting appearance. The actor also benefits from frosh writer Jessica Bendingers playful cynicism which gives birth to such delicious lines as ""Cheerleaders are just dancers gone retarded."" Bendingers script may not be deep but at least it isnt another story about an outsider looking to get in. Everybodys already in. The Clovers are briefly down (they dont have enough money to travel to the competition) but they are never going to be out if their determined head cheerleader (peppery Gabrielle Union) has her way. While the outcome is not wholly predictable its not going to surprise anybody with a good eye for daring gymnastics snazzy choreography and practiced pizazz. It almost makes a gal want to stand up and cheer. Nah. BRING IT ON (PG-13 93 minutes) - Contains sexual innuendo and profanity.

This is a movie in which every last girl even the ""nice"" heroine played by the game and vibrant Kirsten Dunst has the grabby values and shrill lacquered sex bomb personality of a villainous ice princess in a John Hughes movie. These babes barely even go in for pom poms; theyre too hard to play with anything that soft. Adolescent dominatrices in athletic halter tops theyre buffed and polished trophy vixens who reign over a take no prisoners consumer zone where their perfect smiles and midriffs are the ultimate consumer prize. To say that they have pep wouldn t do justice to their snooty proudly fascist empowerment. Theyve got bitch pep. (Introducing your daughters new role models.) Arriving at the end of a summer pockmarked by bad teen movies ""Bring It On"" is something at least mildly different; its an okay brat movie. Torrance (Dunst) whos perky and beautiful but so fine boned that she barely looks resilient enough to be a cheerleader takes over as team captain for the Toros the Rancho Carne High School squad in San Diego who have won the national championship five years in a row. Their routines like all those madly synchronized cheerleader blitzkriegs you occasionally glimpse on ESPN are a blast of goofy aerobic fireworks human pyramids that move like videogames. Torrance however discovers that her squads meticulous body tossing choreography has been ripped off from the East Compton Clovers a black Los Angeles team that couldnt afford to compete on the national circuit. When the Jennifer Beals character appropriated break dance moves at the end of ""Flashdance"" it was treated as a bold triumph of ""good girl gone street"" movement (and racial sensitivity). Now when all of youth culture has been thoroughly hip-hopped the idea I guess is that even white girls need to find their moves... inside. In essence the plot of ""Bring It On"" is a demographic ploy - i.e. can the movie pull in young black viewers as well as white? Torrance and her crew may be going for their ""dream"" but the movie which is clever enough to tweak their shallow obsession with victory could scarcely care less; its really a celebration of their high dis style of one upmanship and heartless sexual bravado. ""This is not a democracy"" declares Torrance. ""Its a cheerocracy"" Few actresses besides Kirsten Dunst could deliver that line with a straight face and make it seem innocent in its very arrogance. After her lovely 70s daze in ""The Virgin Suicides"" she gets to show some spunk here - maybe too much - but its her mixture of delicacy and vivacity that holds the picture together. I do wish the movie made flashier use of its pop soundtrack. The closing credits which blend blooper outtakes with scenes of the actresses lip-synching to Bwitcheds remake of Toni Basils ""Mickey"" has a bump and grind exhilaration that nothing preceding it can match. That said ""Bring It On"" a late August throwaway pitched between exploitation and satire has more life to it than such recent teen duds as ""Boys and Girls"" ""Whatever It Takes"" or the limp cringe worthy ""Loser."" Those movies in their way were sincere; this one is proudly crass. That makes it at the very least of the moment.
