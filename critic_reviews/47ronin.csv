"Fight Schlub The Flabby 47 Ronin << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Fight Schlub The Flabby 47 Ronin Courtesy of Universal Pictures Movies December 26 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Everything that works for Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone in Grudge Match works against Keanu Reeves in 47 Ronin. Hes passive and deferential. This is a mystical samurai fantasy based on a defining Japanese honor-and-revenge legend. The cast is mostly Japanese and the deference on Reevess part feels like an act of resistance. He cedes the foreground to the nonwhite stars -- Hiroyuki Sanada Tadanobu Asano Kou Shibasaki Rinko Kikuchi and Jin Akanishi. But theyre required to act in English and it seems like hell on their comfort. Whenever someone talks here the film cuts to whomever that actor is addressing or uses a wide shot that makes it hard to see whos speaking. More than once an actor just puts his hand over his mouth. This becomes the same thing as sticking a sofa in front a pregnant actress on TV. Good acting isnt crucial to a big action movie. Confidence is. And you feel as if the actors here are being undermined by all the cheating. A dubbed Japanese-language version might almost have been preferable. Even then theres nothing pretty or exciting about this movie (inexplicably its in 3-D) even when all anyones doing is fighting. It doesnt matter how far Reeves stands in the distance The movies mostly about his rejected half-Japanese half-British character Kai. Hes a ticket-sales concoction mixed up in a droopy love story with a slain shoguns daughter (Shibasaki) who gets the concubine treatment with a nasty master (Asano). In this telling the formative tale of self-sacrificial honor seems unworthy of the consequences. You get Kikuchi of Babel and Pacific Rim doing a lot his hissing and shape-shifting. Theres also a computer-generated wolf a mysterious rumbling beast and a protagonist whose Matrix-like superpowers remain mostly suppressed. The suppression goes for Reeves all around. When hes in motion here which is about two or three times you think that The Force is still with him. Hes been interested in the upsides of working in Asia -- last month his first movie as a director Man of Thai Chi came and went. It was a wobbly looking occasionally preposterous but often intense martial-arts thriller starring the stuntman Tiger Chen with Reeves having a good time as the bad-guy owner of a fight club. That movie had everything thats missing from him in 47 Ronin a sense of the present.

This unnecessary Hollywood version tries to make the tale more palatable to Western audiences by adding things like computer-animated monsters and Keanu Reeves (playing a half-British samurai who improbably becomes the groups leader). Those crazy additions might have yielded the sort of wild genre entertainment one associates with director Takashi Miike yet the pacing is cloddish and tone unaccountably dour. To make things more awkward the dialogue is in English and few of the Japanese actors sound comfortable speaking it. Carl Rinsch directed.

Share Tweet 47 Ronin is one of the strangest big-budget productions in recent memory a 3-D fantasy set in 18th-century Japan shot in Hungary and the U.K. with a predominantly Japanese cast and distinguished by ornate production design arcane intrigue and a downbeat tone which bring to mind David Lynchs flawed-but-fascinating take on Dune. Pitched as a sort of Japanophile equivalent to Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter the movie takes a historical incident that has since become an essential national myth frontloads it with supernatural elements and then plays it completely straight. The 300-year-old story of the 47 ronin--samurai who sought revenge against the man who drove their master to suicide--becomes an epic battle of physical skill versus witchcraft. The Dutch trading post at Dejima becomes a Pirates Of The Caribbean-like hideaway where slaves fight ogres in gladiatorial combat. Edo-era Japan functions much as medieval Europe does in dragon-and-wizard fantasies a freeform backdrop where exaggerated historical elements and fairy-tale tropes seem equally at home.47 Ronins weird cross-referential imagery is enough to make it watchable. (Tellingly the movies credits include a character called ""Lovecraftian Samurai."") That the film works as anything more than an elaborate game of guess-the-citation is a credit to two key elements the first being its imaginative visual sensibility an expressionist approach to costuming and set design that comes as welcome relief from the grays-and-earth-tones look of contemporary tentpole fantasy filmmaking. The color scheme (rich reds deep purples bursts of yellow and mint green) complements the movies crazy-quilt aural texture the sound of a dozen mismatched accents--an American leading a cast with varying degrees of English fluency--intermingling. No character better exemplifies the movies out-there visual sense than the shapeshifting witch (a scene-stealing Rinko Kikuchi) with heterochromatic eyes who uses her long tentacle-like hair as an extra set of limbs and occasionally disappears into a swirl of colorful fabrics.Then theres the movies minor-key fatalism which is surprisingly faithful to the source material at least when one considers the inclusion of fantastic beasts immortal warrior sects and black magic. Oishi Yoshio (Hiroyuki Sanada) still serves as the leader of the ronin and the strategist of their revenge against court favorite Kira (Tadanobu Asano) but the script adds a second protagonist in the form of Kai (Keanu Reeves top-billed but offscreen for stretches of the film) a servant of partly European parentage. In a different perhaps more box-office-savvy film Kai would be a Western audience identification figure but in 47 Ronin hes the most mysterious character an outsider devoted to social codes of selflessness and rank content to receive no respect from the other characters. (The role is tailor-made for Reeves intensely neutral screen persona.) A Hollywood special-effects extravaganza on a thoroughly pre-modern theme is bound to hit some bum notes and at least one part of 47 Ronin--a romance between Kai and his lords daughter (Ko Shibasaki)--never gels with the rest of the narrative. (The movie retains the source materials very un-Hollywood ending.) Considering its notoriously troubled history--the 175 million project directed by first-timer Carl Rinsch went into production almost three years ago--some blatant re-cutting is expected; the Dejima episode where Oishi goes to rescue Kai from Dutch slave traders feels like a severely shortened version of a longer sequence. But despite these flaws the movie still amounts to a singular viewing experience a multi-colored downer fantasy which combines bursts of imagination with a bleak worldview resulting in something that rarely feels mainstream.

This is one of the key national legends of Japan already immortalized in film numerous times notably in Kenji Mizoguchis spare grim 1941 masterpiece The 47 RoninA and Hiroshi Inagakis splendorousA Chushingura (1962). Attempting toA demean such a glorious cinematic lineage with a fanboy-ized fantasy-action flick would be like someone making an Abraham Lincoln movie in which he fights vampires. Crazy talkA Or you could look at this way The legend about a group of leaderless samurai who reclaimed their dead lords honor and then committed ritual suicide comes pre-debased. Every writer filmmaker playwright or whatever who has tackled the subject over the centuries has added his or her own spin on the narrative. So why cant Hollywood insert a littleA Pirates of the Caribbean-esque oomph to this tale of feudal honor and revenge? In this variation the ronin are joined by a half-breed named Kai (Keanu Reeves) who is discovered as a young refugee in the forest and taken in by the feudal lord Asano (Min Tanaka). Its an obvious Hollywoodism Kai is the scrappy half-white underdog the guy without any pedigree who will predictably grow up to be a great warrior against all odds. But it takes the focus away from the person who should be the hero of this tale -- Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) the leader of Asanos samurai. Oishi and the other warriors are cast adrift as ronin (the term for a masterless samurai) after their lord is framed for an assassination attempt and forced to commit seppuku. But after spending a year inside a dark dank pit Oishi emerges and gets the band back together this time also including Kai whom he had denigrated as a lowly urchin earlier in their lives. Along the way the ronin must confront an assortment of challenges both natural and supernatural including a mountain monastery full of Buddhist monk-demons and Mizuki (Rinko Kikuchi) the octopus-haired witch-serpent-lady thingie whose power protects Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) the usurper who seized the dear departed Lord Asanos throne. The film doesnt entirely shortchange Oishi though Kai/Keanu the Movie Star gets the romantic subplot and the more fully defined character arc. Indeed for its first hour or so the film moves along quite elegantly building up the feudal intrigue and effectively playing the multiple characters off each other. (Its gorgeous too with imaginative evocative production design by Jan Roelfs who used to work with Peter Greenaway back in the day.) At times its kind of like a big soap opera only with fantastical beasts and trolls and crazy demon magic and lots of beheadings. Both Reeves and Sanada cut noble heroic profiles and Kikuchi as the slithery spectral villainess lying in wait at the end of the heroes journey vamps it up with evident glee. Would that everyone else shared her glee. What made something like Pirates of the Caribbean so engaging (the original one not those ghastly sequels) wasnt the addition of supernatural elements but the humor which was the glue that kept all those disparate elements together. In 47 Ronin however the classic myth rests a bit too uneasily against the modernized one. Believe it or not for all its additions its too respectful. You want it to be funnier crazier. You want more scenes like the one where Mizukis magic hair uses a pair of chopsticks. Its hard of course to be irreverent with a story thats basically about a bunch of brave warriors killing themselves out of stoic dedication to an outdated honor code. But this is the task the film has chosen for itself and Im not sure it succeeds. Still its competently put together by director Carl Rinsch a first-timer. Up until the climactic battle sequence most of the fight scenes have clarity and fluidity. (The final one alas is a bit of a mess.) Throughout I couldnt help but feel the guiding hand of Reeves himself whose recent directorial debut Man of Tai Chi evinced a similar attention to spatial logic and graceful movement; the mans clearly got standards. But his earlier film also pulled off the seemingly impossible task of beingA a serious almost stone-faced action movie that still managed to be loads of fun without straying into comedy. This one never quite decides if it wants to be a big boisterous epic or a solemn retelling and it nearly disappears into the crack between the two.

First the cockeyed sensuality of Rinko Kikuchi as a spider-puking evil witch who can transform herself into a fox a swathe of magic-carpet silk or this months second-most impressive movie dragon. Second is those flying silks whose airborne undulations demonstrate more personality than any of the characters save that witch herself -- shes cursive calligraphy in a cast of square and clunking alphabet blocks. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - And a distant third is one sequence of amusing movie violence. The good guys -- all 47 of them -- are storming the palace of the lord who banished them shamed them tricked their master into committing seppuku and kidnapped their princess. (Hes four villains in one) These masterless ronin scale a wall in a snowstorm lasso the evil lords guards to yank them off the ramparts and work all sorts of impossible traps and tricks to thin the enemies ranks. Its like a reverse Home Alone and its the only sustained burst of excitement in 47 Ronins two grinding hours -- and it lasts maybe three minutes.Other than that the movie is all slow portentous dialogue. Each word drips out like tree sap. Keanu Reeves stars but doesnt say much which usually isnt a bad idea with him. In this case though hes one of the few castmembers who seems comfortable speaking the English everyone in the films feudal Japan relies upon. Several of the actors sound as if they may have learned their lines phonetically and quite a few seem not to have mastered English ls and rs -- it seems cruel then that the producers force them to keep calling Reevess character ""half-breed.""Film Details 47 Ronin RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time127 More Info That isnt a complaint really. Since all the dialogue is blandly declaimed like everyone is reading it off stone tablets the quirks of ESL at least offer a touch of humanity to this shopworn spectacle. Theyre something to think about besides the ridiculous liberties Hollywood has taken with Japanese history. The story is slow and simple although director Carl Rinsch still manages to muddy it. Reeves plays Kai the half-breed -- his true lineage is meant to be mysterious although the movie hints hes the spawn of avian demon-monks with gills in their noses. Orphan Kai grows up in the palace of Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) where as a kid he teaches unattainable crush Mika how to hunt. After a scene or two with child actors Kai ripens into the pushing-50 Reeves while Mika somehow ages two decades fewer in the same time. Her adult incarnation is played by Ko Shibasaki; she trembles while Reeves recites the kind of poetry spoken by fantasy characters too in love to bother actually touchingeach other.As in many other versions of this often-told tale wicked lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) tricks Asano into attacking his own guests which results in Asano being sentenced to commit seppuku. Try not to snicker when the lord who hands that ruling down immediately defines the punishment just in case any of the assorted samurai skipped the class covering the whole ritualized suicide thing. Soon after the first of many PG-13 disembowelings Asanos samurai guardsmen led by the warrior Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) are exiled to the wilderness where they plot revenge. Kai tags along even though none of them like or respect him -- the movie suggests this is because hes different and also maybe part demon but its hard not to suspect that its actually because he failed to distinguish himself in any way in what has to be half a centuryof living in their company.On the road though Kai wins their respect the only way movies know by slaying lots of enemies. 47 Ronin isnt bloody but it one-ups the irresponsible ugliness of Hollywoods usual endorsements of violence in one disquieting respect It suggests that killing bad guys is only slightly less noble than killing yourself. The story of 47 Ronin dates back to the 18th century so dont complain about spoilers as I tear into the ending In the classic samurai films suicide is complex upsetting sometimes unjust and sometimes the only way to ease a soul in crisis; here it feels like a yoga-class graduation.The adventures include a descent into the bird demons cave a fight against a furious Snuffleupagus and much undistinguished sword play. Theres also lots of scenes of travelers and mountains a la Peter Jacksons Middle Earth movies the occasional CG monster to battle and maybe 20 minutes worth of talking all of it ready to be wiped away and re-dubbed for the international audience. Theyll know better than to think of it as Japanese I expect. Despite the lavish temple sets the robed pageantry the principled sexlessness and the strident talk of honor and ancestry this Hungarian-shot bore is so indistinct it reeks of no place more than Hollywood where the fascinating specifics of history and legend are ground into universal mush.1 Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Review 47 Ronin doesnt quite cut it as a samurai fantasy - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review 47 Ronin doesnt quite cut it as a samurai fantasy 47 Ronin Frank Connor / Associated Press Keanu Reeves left and Hiroyuki Sanada in a scene from ""47 Ronin."" Keanu Reeves left and Hiroyuki Sanada in a scene from ""47 Ronin."" (Frank Connor / Associated Press) Mark Olsen Theres the kind of movie that comes riding into theaters on such a prolonged wave of bad buzz -- changed release dates backstage whispers of production troubles and a swelling budget -- that the film itself starts to seem beside the point something to just get out of the way. Thats the case with ""47 Ronin"" an overlong underwhelming movie now hitting theaters that certainly wasnt worth the wait.The story opens with a stentorian voice-over announcing that ancient feudal Japan as history buffs will no doubt be happy to learn was a time of witchcraft and demons. Kai (Keanu Reeves) -- referred to throughout the film as a ""half-breed"" though it is somewhat unclear if that is half-Anglo or half-demon -- lives in exile in the woods protected by the benevolent Lord Asano. After Asano is forced to commit seppuku by the ruling shogun following an incident in which he was bewitched his faithful samurai led by Oishi are cast adrift as masterless Ronin. The evil Lord Kira has eyes on Asanos daughter Mika and eventually Kai Oishi and the Ronin attempt to save Mika and avenge Asanos death.PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Kenneth Turan The ad campaign for the film is focused on Reeves understandably so one could be forgiven for spending time during the film wondering ""Wheres Keanu?"" and ""Who are all these other people?"" Though Reeves does have a key role the storytelling and screen time is also very much focused on such performers as Hiroyuki Sanada as Oishi Tadanobu Asano as Kira Ko Shibasaki as Mika and Rinko Kikuchi as a treacherous witch. Those expecting all Keanu all the time will be left feeling off-balance.The film comes at something of a transitional moment in Reeves career as he has been on a run of unexpected seemingly passion-driven projects such as producing the engaging documentary ""Side By Side"" about shooting on film versus digital moviemaking as well as his directing debut with ""Man of Tai Chi."" That film in which Reeves played the villainous leader of an underground fighting circuit pulsed with the enthusiasm of a martial arts film fan.""47 Ronin"" which is directed by Carl Rinsch has no such feelings behind it. For a film whose story is so steeped in honor there is something dutiful but uninvolved about it respectful without really understanding the deeper traditions -- a student faking it through a quiz. Though based on history the movie is hung up on creating a fantasy-world version of Japanese feudal life. (Japanese filmmaker Takashi Miikes recent ""Hara-Kiri"" and ""13 Assassins"" both created more vibrant lived-in variations on similar themes.)PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Betsy Sharkey Rinsch making his feature debut shows the shortcoming of someone coming from the image-based world of commercials and advertising. There are moments of genuine beauty and a few terrifically eye-popping effects but no feel yet for storytelling.The film becomes something like the punch line to an old ""screw in a light bulb"" joke What does it take to make a samurai fantasy film?

By Gabe Johnson on Publish Date January 3 2014. Photo by Frank Connor/Universal Pictures. Watch in Times Video >> embed Between the prospect of Hollywoods sexing up a legendary Japanese story with rampaging C.G.I. monsters and the eager reports of a protracted production there has been ample opportunity to hobble ""47 Ronin"" long before its warriors finally emerge in theaters. But say what you will about this fantasy adventure set in ""a land shrouded in mystery"" (per the opening voice-over) its still a studio movie adaptation of a story that ends -- centuries-old spoiler -- with mass ritual suicide. Credit due for that bit of faithfulness I suppose -- and Merry Christmas by the way.Variations on the films grim source tale have been produced in Japan since the 18th century including on the screen by the likes of Kenji Mizoguchi and Kon Ichikawa. The historical basis lies in events at the beginning of that century when a lord Asano was ordered to commit hara-kiri after a conflict with another lord Kira. Asanos masterless samurai or ronin set out to avenge him. Their assassination of Kira and subsequent punishment by the shogunate became a double-edged parable of loyalty and obedience.Its a culturally specific story perhaps destined for rewrites at least when confronted with the bottom-line logic of keeping an American star front and center. Built into ""47 Ronin"" is the character of a lowly ""half-breed"" named Kai respectfully played by Keanu Reeves and essentially the legends true savior. The ronins leader Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) recruits Kai in an effort to take down Kira whose intended bride Mika (Ko Shibasaki) Asanos daughter was once romantically linked with Kai. Photo Ko Shibasaki and Keanu Reeves in ""47 Ronin"" directed by Carl Rinsch. Credit Frank Connor/Universal Pictures Providing fodder for fanciful special effects and 3-D imagery are a shape-shifting witch (Rinko Kikuchi in an unsteady vamp) who helps Kira using extravagant conjurings and a back story for Kai in an enchanted forest (apparently named after folkloric creatures called tengu). The lushly designed beasts and careening chases are what you might expect from the films director Carl Rinsch who is making his feature debut after creating advertising work and a viral short featuring well robots and chases. All these flourishes may reflect anxiety over whether the shame- and honor-based narrative would hold the attention of Americans but they can be diverting.Theres a sober pace to this sometimes picturesque film The dutifully arranged action building blocks and the meager story filler are ploddingly punctuated by landscape shots. But ""47 Ronin"" cant entirely paper over the void at its center traceable partly to the shadowboxing of computer-aided filmmaking or studio tinkering. (Reshoots reportedly occurred with changes including the placement of Mr. Reevess character at the center of a climactic battle with a dragon.)Taken as a blithe exercise in fantasy with historical trappings the skewed results feel more inevitable than disappointing. ""47 Ronin"" falls in with a long line of exotic entertainments that have periodically seized American screens since the age of serials in which the maneuverings of adaptation almost feel like part of the drama. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""47 Ronin"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for scary samurai stuff (swordplay suicide) and monstrous bloodthirsty creatures doing their thing. 47 Ronin Director Carl Rinsch Writers Chris Morgan Hossein Amini Stars Keanu Reeves Hiroyuki Sanada Ko Shibasaki Tadanobu Asano Rinko Kikuchi Rating PG-13 Genres Action Adventure Drama Fantasy Movie data powered by IMDb.com Last updated Mar 30 2016 A version of this review appears in print on December 25 2013 on page C14 of the New York edition with the headline An Old Flame Shows Up but Who Invited the Witch and Monsters?.

Area theaters. In 3-D where available. Memo to Hollywood Find another use for Keanu Reeves. In the monumentally dull ""47 Ronin"" Reeves mumbles monosyllabic claptrap between dull action scenes. And its a shame At almost 50 years old the actor allows this turgid clanky flick to play to his worst stereotypes. Reeves plays Kai a mystical ""half-breed"" who is one of 47 warriors who become masterless samurai (aka ""ronin"") after the villain Kira (Tadanobu Asano) kills their lord to conquer the land. Though not accepted by his fellow outcasts Kai has been trained in survival and sorcery by earless snake-men in a forest. They provide the ronin with swords to fight for their masters honor. Going into battle in 47 Ronin Besides Kiras army there are cheesy CG beasts that need to be defeated and a wispy witch who consorts with Kira before turning into a giant un-scary snake. It all feels very videogame-ish. The scenery is like what George Lucas might hallucinate after too much green tea and Xanax. Reeves affection for martial arts was evident in ""Man of Tai Chi"" a recent indie he directed Now he ought to do more small capers like ""Henrys Crime"" or use his Otherness in rom-dramas like ""The Lake House.""

Books have been written operas composed and numerous movies made (the most notable in 1941 by the great Kenji Mizoguchi). Now the English-speaking world gets a moronically loud and obnoxious version of its own tarted up with mythical monsters gravity-defying swordplay and Keanu Reeves. His Whoa-ness plays Kai a half-breed servant with kick-ass fighting skills. After his lord is forced to commit seppuku due to the machinations of an evil witch (Rinko Kikuchi) and the power-hungry soldier (Tadanobu Asano) she has under her spell Kai teams up with several dishonored warriors to seek vengeance. The basics of the story remain unchanged but its the wanna-be-blockbuster additions that rankle be it the incoherent direction of first-time feature director Carl Rinsch or the copious CGI beasties who look like rejected Lord of the Rings villains.

Emotion was palpable and fantasy Harry Potter like episodes seemed to be developed from Japanese legends and culture and therefore did not seem completely arbitrary. I was spellbound found the Japanese-English a plus and it should stand proud with its resonances of Shakespeare and Kurosawa. The makers of this film had their sights on things other than the box office - congratulationsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 2 2014JonathanFeaturedSaw the 47 Ronin yesterday and enjoyed it very much. The basic story was all there but a Japanese folklore was threaded throughout; which I very much appreciated. This take is more of legend that would be told to children and on that level it succeeds in reaching the child in us all. The key plot points of Lord Kiras treachery and Lord Asanos disgrace are present along with the inevitable fate that await the Ronin in the pursuit of selfless honor and retribution. Hiroyuki Sanada plays the Ronin leader Oishi and is in fact the primary protagonist. Keanu Reeves is a supporting character and a window for western audiences to be introduced to Japans cultural tale of Bushido and mythic story telling style. He is by no means the lead and his presence serves to enrich the subtext of the film which is Honor is achieved not given. Live your life to its fullest but die well. Live in a way to inspire men even if it will certainly cost you everything. Do right even if it will shame you even unto death. I cant respond to the critics. I just think they didnt get it. I am a practitioner of Japanese Bujutsu arts and have a great respect for the ideals and traditions preserved in Bushido. In my opinion this film was respectful to the material and creative in its approach.

Photo Frank Connor/Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW 47 Ronin Not the sharpest sword. Running time 127 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence). At the 34th Street the Kips Bay others. Once upon a time a small band of scrappy fighters had to forge their way through a magical landscape against incredible odds. If you didnt get enough of that in the new ""Hobbit"" then by all means check out ""47 Ronin"" which substitutes ancient Japan for Middle Earth and samurai warriors for dwarves. This retelling of a Japanese legend of exiled soldiers on a vengeance mission is blown out into a fairly mechanical Hollywood product by first-time feature director Carl Rinsch who careens from one set piece to another with a blend of passable 3-D and dialogue so wooden it seems dubbed. In the middle of it theres Keanu Reeves in his first mainstream role in years as the hero Kai. Abandoned as a child in a supernatural forest hes taken in by a kindly samurai master (Min Tanaka) who raises him as a sort of sword-wielding Cinderella alongside daughter Mika (Ko Shibasaki of ""Battle Royale"" with little to do here). Their friendship deepens as they grow up but as Kai tells her ""You have your place and I have mine."" His place for much of the first half is pretty marginal. If youre going to have Keanu in your action movie for Gods sake put him in the middle of things. He knows kung fu. When the master is cut down by a diabolical warlord (Tadanobu Asano) his samurai are expelled rendering them ""ronin"" or masterless warriors. Their captain Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) is thrown into a pit; Kai is sold into slavery. You can tell a lot about this movie by its marketing focus on head-to-toe tattooed artist Rick Genest who figured prominently in its trailer and poster art. This human skeleton appears for seriously the blink of an eye. But its clear someone thinks hes the most fabulous-looking thing about it. This is a disservice because all the visuals in ""47 Ronin"" are arresting -- epic ancient Japanese with some wild flourishes. A roomful of gold-robed gold-eyed monks attack one samurai in an elegant hallucination sequence; a witch (Rinko Kikuchi) wears a flowing green silk dress that twists into the air turning into a dragons body. And the geishas Their eyebrows are painted on a half-inch from their hairlines. Itd all make a great video but it doesnt hang together well enough to make a functional movie. As Oishi and Kai plan a revenge attack with the loyal ronin evil lord Kira (Asano) plots with Kikuchis witch to force Mika to marry him. It all begins to seem like an Asian meditation on Super Mario as Kai and company must ascend various levels (fire dragon bad theater) to rescue the princess. But theres little sense of urgency or -- oddly given the films title -- of scale. You never really think that the 47 are truly outnumbered and the large action scenes are often just incomprehensible. Which is too bad because its fleetingly good (for some of us anyway) to see Reeves again. An actor whos been spending much of his time in the fringes of indie cinema lately he seems almost like an afterthought in this big-budget movie banking on his name.

Now Hollywood has taken it on tricked it out and done it no favors.While the visuals are lovely to behold this unremarkable version of the classic 18th century Japanese legend is stiff and uninvolving.The movie sheds little light on Japanese culture though it features a cast of Japanese actors except for Keanu Reeves who essentially is a supporting player. Its re-interpretation of the legend mostly offers a vehicle for computer-generated creatures and protracted unimpressive action sequences. Speeches are made swords are passed around and Reeves glowers a lot. A more ingenious script with fewer cliches in its dialogue would have improved things and allowed the talented cast to shine more brightly.VIDEO Reeves 47 Ronin will be fantasticalREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThe story which centers on 47 samurai who are disgraced and left without their leader Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) draws upon sorcery dragons animal avatars and shape-shifting in a way befitting a tale of wizards or vampires rather than samurai folklore. Asano is lured by a mysterious witch (Rinko Kikuchi) into attacking an unarmed royal guest.When the emperor learns of his deed Asano is sentenced to death or allowed to commit a more heroic suicide known as seppuku. He chooses the latter.His 47 samurai are left without a leader and banished from their kingdom.They regroup organized by Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) and aided by the mysterious Kai (Reeves) to take their vengeance on the evil and power-mad Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) who masterminded the plot that resulted in Asanos demise.Reeves is billed as the films star but he is more accurately a key part of an ensemble. Kai is a ""half-breed"" taken in as a young child by Lord Asano. Though others treat him as a second-class citizen Kai forges a bond with Asanos daughter Mika (Ko Shibasaki). Their growing romance is merely thrown into the martial-arts saga. Reeves and Shibasaki dont convey much chemistry.Kai and his warrior pals decide to save her while avenging Lord Asanos death.The action can be confusing and suspense takes a while to build captivating audiences only during the climactic battle when the ronin and Kai invade the estate of the evil Kira who has made a pact with the shape-shifting witch. These two menacing characters are the best parts of the movie with Kikuchi whose alter ego is a snowy white fox making the most of her malevolent seductress persona.Its hard to care about any of the other playershowever since the movie is intent on showcasing Kai who we learn has special powers. Though Reeves moves are strikingly lithe -- showing no evidence of his 49 years -- he comes across as stilted and bland in a role in which hes meant to be a tortured hero.While the painted backdrops and locations are stunning the whole thing seems more like a video game instead of a grand epic.The film opens with the premise ""To know the story of the 47 Ronin is to know the story of Japan. "" Alas this plodding reimagining does not come close to fulfilling its promise. 15 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/K03Aqr",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/23/47-ronin-review/3585435/,200,47ronin11,47ronin,usatoday

Photo Credit Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A retelling of the Japanese legend in which 47 banished samurai avenge their masters murder. Rated PG-13 (violence) BOTTOM LINE Uneven mix of samurai swordplay and CGI creatures. CAST Keanu Reeves Rinko Kinkushi Hiroyuki Sanada LENGTH 159 A Japanese legend with roots in reality the tale of the 47 ronin has been adapted into just about every medium imaginable from ballet to movies to graphic novels. Now Keanu Reeves stars in ""47 Ronin"" an Americanized or perhaps internationalized version of one of Japans most treasured tales. Its the story of Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) leader of a group of samurai living in peace under their master Lord Asano (Min Tanaka). But when Asano is killed by Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) and his nameless Witch (Rinko Kikuchi) the samurai become masterless ronin scattered throughout the countryside. To regain their honor and avenge their master they must kill Kira even though it may mean their own death.

Hes an add-on to the story a half-breed named Kai who was raised by demons. He is mistreated Cinderella-style by the samurai until the now-masterless Oishi needs his help. Slowly but surely Kai earns the soldiers respect. ""47 Ronin"" can be a hoot with some zippy battles staged by director Carl Rinsch and a script by several writers that works better than expected. But it also feels like a somewhat botched attempt by Hollywood to bridge the cultural gap between the North American and overseas box offices. Nearly the entire cast is Japanese -- and nearly all excellent -- yet they speak English. Whats most impressive about ""47 Ronin"" -- its strict adherence to the ancient Japanese honor code of bushido -- is also what finally drags it down. The themes of honor and death that run through the movie may not instictively resonate with American audiences.. ""47 Ronin"" would have been more fun if it kept swinging its sword instead of falling on it. 233 Movies47 Ronin trailer PLOT A retelling of the Japanese legend in which 47 banished samurai avenge their masters murder. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (violence) CAST Keanu Reeves Rinko Kinkushi Hiroyuki Sanada LENGTH 159 BOTTOM LINE Uneven mix of samurai swordplay and CGI creatures. 142 MoviesHoliday movie trailers Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

TWITTER Keanu Reeves plays a half-blood Japanese outsider enlisted by a band of leaderless samurai to avenge their masters death in Universals 3D action epic from director Carl Rinsch. The eagerness of the major studios to cozy up to Asian markets yields awkward results in 47 Ronin a lumpy 3D epic from Universal that fuses Japanese historical legend with generic CGI-heavy action fantasy. While the reported 175 million budget is evident in the handsome production values of Carl Rinschs ambitious first feature it falls short on character definition emotional involvement narrative drive and originality with a protagonist played by Keanu Reeves who often gets bumped to the sidelines. Following its soft start in Japan the English-language film may prove too Hollywood for Eastern audiences and too Asian to crack the American commercial mainstream. As we hear in reams of opening voiceover the saga of the 47 ronin dates back to early 18th century feudal Japan. The disenfranchised samurai avenged the disgrace and death of their master Lord Asano by killing Kira the villain responsible for his dishonor in direct defiance of the ruling Shoguns orders to refrain from retaliation. Their quest of loyalty and sacrifice would cost them their lives either in battle or in enforced ritual suicide as punishment for their transgression. Numerous accounts of the tragedy many of them elaborately fictionalized have been produced for theater opera film and television over the years including screen versions by Kenji Mizoguchi and Kon Ichikawa. PHOTOS 10 Hollywood Films Tweaked for International Release Arguably the biggest problem with this retelling is the conflicted impulses of the hybrid screenplay by Chris Morgan (a regular on the Fast amp; Furious franchise) and Hossein Amini (whose recent work has included Drive and Snow White and the Huntsman). It strives to be respectful of source material deeply embedded in Japanese popular culture while at the same time juicing up the story for Western audiences raised on action blockbusters videogames and broad-strokes melodrama. Given the inscrutable nature of the samurai code the key concession to international sensibilities is the introduction of a fictional outsider to find redemption on a heros journey in which he leads the stoical warriors to victory. That would be Kai (Reeves) scorned as a ""half-breed"" (just like the Cher song) believed to have been raised in the forest by demons. Rescued by Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) as a boy Kai grows up deeply devoted to the feudal leader sharing a secret love with Asanos beautiful daughter Mika (Ko Shibasaki). Kais most excellent swordsmanship is demonstrated in a frenetic hunt scene that seems lifted out of The Croods during which he saves a resentful samurai by slaying a blurry CGI creature with six eyes and lethal antlers. Meanwhile treacherous Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano) of the neighboring province and his shape-shifting sorceress advisor (Rinko Kikuchi) plot his rise to power and Lord Asanos downfall. Kais warnings of witchcraft go unheeded leaving the samurais robbed of their leader and exiled Asanos top-ranking deputy Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada) imprisoned in a pit to break his spirit and the heartbroken Mika promised in marriage to Kira. But when Oishi is released he tracks down half-mad Kai sold into slavery in a Dutch island freak show where hes forced to fight monsters for spectator sport. Regrouping the ronin they plan their attack on Kira. Oh and to stock up on weaponry Kai takes them to the trippy Tengu forest where Lord Voldemort or actually some kind of creepy supernatural bird-man monk with no ears or nose (Togo Igawa) tests their will before handing over the blades. Reeves plays Kais chronic low self-esteem his troubled soul and his burning hunger for justice with the same permanently furrowed brow. That fits with Rinsch and the screenwriters prevailing solemnity and inexpressive approach to character. But while much is made of the star-crossed lover angle between Kai and gentle personality-deprived Mika as well as his gradual earning of the acceptance and respect of the ronin Kai seems grafted onto the story. STORY 47 Ronin Sees Disappointing Start in Japan Oishi is by far the more compelling character as well as the legends legitimate protagonist and Sanada gives the films most nuanced performance. (Speaking of bastardized Japanese archetypes Sanada is one of two actors on board who played Emilys samurai mentor on ABCs archly ludicrous Revenge along with Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who turns up here as the Shogun.) With the exception of the fat comic relief (Takato Yonemoto) and Oishis son (Jin Akanishi) a pretty boy-band refugee with sculpted eyebrows the other warriors are interchangeable giving the audience little to invest in as the stakes get raised. Not that the wooden dialogue allows them much of a chance. On the sinister side Asano (Thor) makes a one-note smug antagonist while Kikuchi (best known for her Oscar-nominated turn in Babel) vamps tirelessly to diminishing effect as Kiras vicious Lady Macbeth-like Witch. She transforms herself into a white fox or a serpentine dragon hatches poisonous spiders hurls fireballs and works her magic hair tendrils like Medusa by way of a Tsui Hark movie. While the CGI is uneven in terms of the creature effects and wide cityscape shots the Witchs shifts from shadow to smoke to sinuous floating fabric and then back to human form are gorgeously rendered. The fascination with cyborgs that Rinsch showed in his high-concept futuristic commercials and his robot espionage short The Gift is evident in Kiras armor-clad fighter giant -- one of many elements that make this a mishmash of too many disharmonious influences. The director at one point was rumored to be in line for Prometheus until Ridley Scott signed on but his long-awaited feature debut is very much a mixed bag. Some of the action sequences demonstrate bold assurance notably the climactic clash when the ronin infiltrate Kiras fortress. But while the buildup to that battle gathers steam too much of the poorly paced movie either bogs down in exposition or marks time and Rinsch displays scant interest in working with the actors to develop their characters. A lack of faith in the material is suggested by the relentless use of Ilan Eshkeris tumescent symphonic score. Cinematographer John Mathieson does a classy job however bringing majesty composure and impressive depth of field to the visuals shot on Hungarian locations and at Shepperton Studios in England. Production designer Jan Roelfs and costumer Penny Rose clearly had lots of cash to play with and the result is sumptuous if at times borderline suffocating overloading on color. The use of 3D is mostly quite restrained but perhaps inevitably seems a superfluous flourish when slapped onto a noble tale of loyalty honor and the ancient ways of bushido.

"47 Ronin Review Keanu Reeves Stars in Bogus Update of Japanese Legend | Variety Variety Continue to Variety () Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review 47 Ronin Peter Debruge Chief Film Critic AskDebruge 18 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr December 23 2013 | 0900AM PT Keanu Reeves is the draw but not the star of this visually dazzling but thoroughly bogus update of one of Japans greatest legends. In Japan the story of the 47 ronin is so central to the countrys national identity that a special word exists for the act of retelling it Chushingura. But despite this long tradition of flexible reinterpretation the Hollywood-backed ""47 Ronin"" takes such liberties with the underlying legend that a different term comes to mind one better suited to American actor Keanu Reeves involvement ""bogus."" So far Japanese audiences have been slow to embrace a CG-heavy version of the story that offers Keanu as a previously unsung ""half-breed"" accomplice. Meanwhile domestic crowds are being deliberately misled to think hes the star -- a high-stakes bait-and-switch sure to backfire on this narratively stiff but compositionally dazzling production when it opens Dec. 25 in the U.S. In theory director Carl Rinschs considerable visual talents should have been the draw with the expectation that the first-time director would deliver on the promise of his dazzling short film ""The Gift."" Sure enough in his hands ""47 Ronin"" rivals the epic martial-arts films of Tsui Hark or Zhang Yimou in terms of sheer spectacle bringing a dark almost gothic feel to the Eastern environments The look suggests ""Hero"" as crossed with Tim Burton or perhaps a fresh image-driven auteur to pick up where Tarsem has stumbled. But as the budget crept ever skyward reportedly reaching as high as 225 million Universals marketing department shifted into panic mode opting to disguise the fact that the true heroes of this epic Japanese legend were themselves Japanese and positioning Reeves character -- described as the shameful ""love of one night"" between an English sailor and a local peasant girl -- as a superficial ploy to attract international crowds. And so the actual star of the film the great Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada (recently afforded widespread exposure alongside Hugh Jackman in ""The Wolverine"") is entirely absent from U.S. posters. The public is thus encouraged to consider this most fundamental of Japanese stories from the point of view of a side character whose presence introduces a fresh theme of racial tolerance along with the more classical aspects of self-sacrifice and honor. Like all Chushingura ""47 Ronin"" recounts the tragic Ako incident (spoilers ahead) during which Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) was forced to commit seppuku after illegally striking an unarmed royal guest leaving the 47 samurai who had been under his command without a master. After more than a year adrift these ronin (as disgraced samurai are known) returned staging a daring night raid in which they took their revenge vindicated their master and were ultimately forced to sacrifice their own lives in punishment. Sanada plays Oishi leader of the desperate group of ronin who turns to mysterious stranger Kai (Reeves) for help when planning his coup. With three writers credited (Chris Morgan and Walter Hamada for story ""Drive"" scribe Hossein Amini and Morgan for the script itself) the project resists easy reverse-engineering though given Reeves international profile its no surprise that he was given the films romantic subplot. Kais love is star-crossed for multiple reasons -- not least of which that nearly all the male leads end up dead either in battle or by ritual suicide -- though it doesnt help matters that the object of his affection is Asanos daughter Mika (an unremarkable Kou Shibasaki) already promised to Oishi. Perhaps it is this connection that inspires Kai whose lowly class separates him from the esteemed samurai to repeatedly risk his life for Asanos honor. Though Rinsch shows no great strength in working with actors he can build a setpiece on par with those of directors decades more experienced and long before Asano has been given the chance to publicly disembowel himself (an act that like so much of the bloodletting is ""tastefully"" left offscreen) Kai has already slain a rampaging CG monstrosity and faced off against a 10-foot silver-armored samurai. The key difference between most Chushingura comes in the speculated motives behind Asanos initial attack upon his rival in the palace -- the act that sets the entire tragedy in motion. To this fantasy-infused telling Rinsch introduces the notion of witchcraft casting Rinko Kikuchi as a deliciously evil witch with ambiguous powers. Basically anything that might look cool when rendered by the industrys finest effects houses is fair game whether that means the witch conjuring iridescent spiders out of thin air or transforming herself into a three-dimensional dragon. As impressive as these visual elements prove to be the film struggles to grab and maintain audiences interest whether or not they know the underlying legend by heart. That said while ""47 Ronin"" may have cost a fortune at least the money found its way up on the screen. Though the film teeters on the verge of bad-movie damnation (its confusing without quite being inscrutable and arch without succumbing to camp) it redeems its existence by supplying dozens of striking original compositions especially during the climactic night raid timed to coincide with Mikas wedding to the man (Tadanobu Asano) responsible for her fathers death. Still theres something undeniably old-fashioned about the entire experience -- like the matte-painted fantasy-scapes of early sound cinema. Even though nearly all the scenes take place outdoors theres the closed-in feel of actors performing against greenscreens to the extent that even group shots of the 47 ronin tend to feature no more than five or six of them together at once.

Hero gets pulled into or creates a war hero says some inspiring speech hero destroys town and all its people. Unfortunately before the Industrial Revolution wars were long and were fought without bombs. I agree with the direction this movie took on the ""spirit"" of the legend. Adding and taking away from the original story to hook people that might have just come to watch Keanu. Lets be honest people do that sort of thing. It also provided just enough of the original story to maybe please people that are familiar with the heroic 47. I think the movie was good it had some parts that werent quite clean enough for the story to keep rolling. It wasnt a disaster film and all the clever quips about ritual suicide are really an american audience lost on the ways of another culture. Open your mind a little and youll come off less ignorant. Reply No name says December 30 2013 at 256 pm Mika was not promised to Oishi he already had a wife he loved very much and a son. Did you not actually see the film? I think critics got it wrong with this film overall and some just jump on the bandwagon of hating it. I personally did see it and enjoyed it very much. They never did say it was a true recounting of historical events so just enjoy it for what it is. Reply Edith says December 30 2013 at 204 am I enjoyed it Keanu Reeves is such an amazing actor this film didnt give him a good chance to show his talent but over all worth watching Reply Edith says December 30 2013 at 202 am I went to see this movie the day after Christmas. I really enjoyed it I do however wish a better director had done it instead... Keanu Reeves is an amazing actore love all his films this film doesnt even give him a chance to show that still worth it Reply Patrick Brown says December 28 2013 at 808 pm Saw the movie today and enjoyed it. Is it ""great cinema"" no. Im miffed at the venom dished out to actors and movies these days. Some people act as if its a personal affront if the movie isnt Oscar material. I pay to get away from my life for 2 hours. If the film does that its a good one to me. If Im thinking about what I need to do afterwards its a bad one. This one wasnt a bad one in my book. Reply John Hart says December 27 2013 at 522 pm What a strange place Hollywood is Am I the only one to recall the magnificent Toho Company production of ""Cushingura"" done in the 1960s? That film made sense of the story. The payoff for this knock-off copy is deserved. I hope that Universal loses the corporate shirt. The whole production team should commit ritual seppuku out of shame that they dishonoured such a wonderful story with their schlock film. Reply Mike Robinson says December 27 2013 at 1248 pm This movie was absolutely abysmal Given how aesthetically rich 1700 century Japan was and important the story of the Chushingura (The Loyal 47 Retainers) to Japanese cultural identity I was amazed at how little apparent historical reseach the costume set designers and writers did. The film looked cheap despite the huge budget The fatastical changes that the writers pasted into the traditional telling of the story were never integrated in any cohearent way. For the first 30 minutes all I could think was that the movie had to have been made in the Peoples Republic of China and was some sort of politcal effort to discredit Japan given their longstanding enmity. I admit to being a consperacist. As I walked out I was left with the following questions 1.) Who was the Giant Slver Samurai? 2.) Why did the Witch work for the Northern Lord 3.) How could they have spent so much money on such a poor outcome (was this a money laundering scheme for the Yakuza? Another conspiracy theory.) 4.) What was with Sanadas son in the movie...the only one of the 47 to survive. Redeeming scenes The fight on the Dutch ships The assault on the Northern Castle The final fate of the 47. Keanu Reeves Hiroyuki Sanada provide serviceable performances. The rest all was all crap If you want to know more about the the 47 Ronin then rent or buy the 1962 Toho product Chushingura distributed by Image Entertainment. Its long and dated but it does depict what really happened in March of 1701. Well worth a watch. Reply Wm Fred Baty says December 27 2013 at 1128 am Who in their right mind would ever cast Keanu Reeves in any project expected to generate a profit? This guy is a no-talent on a par with Michael Pare. ""B"" movies for SyFy and other chewing gum for the mind are all either of these can muster. Reply Ken says December 27 2013 at 1035 am I saw the movie opening day. This could have been a great movie but its not.... Its just off missed the mark. You could delete all of K. Reeves scenes and still have a decent movie possibly a better movie. Maybe if they had just followed the original story of The 47 Ronin it might have been a better movie. And as far as it being a Fantasy/Action movie it is lacking in both Fantasy and Action. Its just not a big screen movie more like a big screen TV movie. There must be a boat load of deleted scenes that have the rest of the story in it. All in all not a horrible movie just not worth the 8.00 or more spent to see it. 1.00 rental sure. Late night cable movie? perfect. Reply A.W. (arweiss500) says December 26 2013 at 1152 am Mika was NOT ""already promised to Oishi"". Did you watch this film all the way through? Oishi was married ( I loved the tender moments between him and his adoring supportive wife who he tells is ""the joy of his life"") and has a son Chikara who joins his father in the 47 Ronin. Reply tlsnyder42 says December 23 2013 at 358 pm Who cares about the real legend? This is a movie for Gods sake Besides the samurai philosophy behind the real legend of the 47 Ronin led to the militaristic fascism of Shinto Buddhism of the totalitarian Japanese state in the 1930s and World War II. Its an abhorrent philosophy so its too bad they didnt make even further drastic changes in the story. Reply Brian James Spies says December 27 2013 at 258 am Shinto and Buddhism are not the same thing. Shinto is the traditional religion of Japan Buddhism was brought to Japan from China in or about the 14th century. Reply paul lane says December 23 2013 at 440 pm Its a central myth of Japan doofus. Its like the indians at Custers Last Stand beig armed with Machine guns. (Sigh I hope Im not giving M. Bay any free ideas). Reply Paul Lane says December 23 2013 at 1251 pm Most Americans (especially executives) have as much knowledge of Japan and history as can be held in a gnats bunghole.. which isnt so much. Reply Les says December 23 2013 at 1111 am Keanu Reeves is Canadian. Reply Paul Lane says December 27 2013 at 1101 am I think Mr. Canada Keanu just picks up a check and does what hes told. Hire a historian. Reply Glenn C. says December 23 2013 at 1051 am Sorry never heard of Gloria. Why are you mentioning this under this article and review? Reply Silvana says December 23 2013 at 1016 am Paulina Garcia has to be nominated to Academy Award for her amazing and superb performance in Gloria. She is wonderful in the film and Academy must recognize her talent.

An inherently problematic attempt to graft a gaijin savior onto the most famous episode of Japanese folklore this latest example of Chushingura has been a notoriously troubled project from the beginning when Universal provided director Carl Erik Rinsch with an absurd budget of 175 million for his first feature only to see that figure balloon even higher as the film suffered a number of difficulties and delays during post-production. While its always prickly and often unwise to view a movie through the lens of its making ""47 Ronin"" was stitched together with the seamless precision of Frankensteins monster its various sutures so carelessly visible that the circumstances of the films creation are almost impossible to untangle from the film itself. Nearly Brechtian in the extent to which its confrontational editing becomes the text ""47 Ronin"" is flimflammed together with abrupt transitions contextually amputated moments and several different varieties of whiteout. What casual or future viewers might be able to graciously dismiss as catastrophic ineptitude we are burdened with the clarity to understand as a symptom of a greater problem the lump identifying a cancer that has already spread too far. The legend of the 47 Ronin is essentially a simple story of honor and revenge but the tale so pivotally hinges on Japanese customs and caste systems that it almost feels designed to resist any sort of foreign repurposing. The historical narrative begins with an 18th century feudal lord who was compelled to commit ritualistic suicide (or ""Harakiri"" to namecheck the title of a much better movie) after assaulting a devious court official. The lords death left the 47 samurai who served him without a master rendering them ronin a shamed and dishonored class of wayward warriors with no social value. In response to their collective neutering the men banded together and spent two years plotting their revenge on the bureaucrat who upset the lord they served. The fallout of their vengeance would be remembered as the campaigns defining detail and remains the facet of the story that is perhaps least conducive to translation. But where native cinematic titans like Kenji Mizoguchi and Hiroshi Inagaki struggled to successfully adapt this historical saga Hollywood was dedicated to succeed. If those two revered auteurs produced authentic human epics that were overwhelmed by the vast scope of their drama Universal Studios version would solve that problem by doubling down on myth and removing every last trace of humanity adding generic flourishes of magic to the story (witches giant creatures that heavily tattooed guy who used to be one of Lady Gagas backup dancers) until the national flavor at the heart of this story has been completely suffocated under an incoherent wail of florid bullshit. Throw enough money at anything and at some point it will start to feel like a good idea. Carl Erik Rinschs ""47 Ronin"" begins with a bland male narrator declaring that ""The story of the 47 Ronin is the story of Japan"" instantly and inexplicably calling attention to how problematic it is for this particular telling to introduce a white savior. When the tail wags the dog this hard the star justifies the budget rather than the budget justifying the star. Enter the doggedly lovable Keanu Reeves who - in all fairness - is probably the most Asian movie star in the history of mainstream American cinema (his father was Hawaiian and he grew up ""around Chinese art furniture and cuisine"" so his creds check out). Reeves plays Kai a slave with a mysterious past who lives in a shack behind the lords castle. Tormented by the 46 prejudiced samurai who will reluctantly fight beside him and loved by the lords colorblind daughter Kai is eventually revealed to be the only one capable of defeating the villains scantily clad hench-sorceress (the reliably watchable Rinko Kikuchi who slithers across the screen like shes the only one having any fun). Perhaps semi-aware of how troublesome it is to suggest that a foreigner played the heros role in ""the story of Japan"" the film tries to have it both ways clearly identifying Kai as the protagonist while also bending over backwards to isolate him from the central plot. While the internationally famous actor Hiroyuki Sanada is afforded a decent bit of attention as the de facto leader of the ronin Kai is undeniably the films greatest concern as most of the running time that isnt devoted to the faceless mass of avenging warriors is spent following Kai on inane adventures devoid of dramatic action or consequence. The various fight scenes in which Kai is forced to partake are recklessly shot and chaotically jammed together failings compounded by such sequences utter disinterest in meaningfully articulating the films half-assed conception of a fantastical 18th century Japan which seems more inspired by Zack Snyders ""Sucker Punch"" than it does anything from the countrys rich historical imagination. The introduction of a foreign protagonist does nothing to add a new dimension to this idiosyncratic saga (though the film is presented in 3D a redundancy to ensure that you have absolutely no idea what youre looking at) the script briefly flirting with the idea that honor is as arbitrary as racial prejudice before dismissing that idea in favor of Reeves squaring off with a tumored Sasquatch. And while the fights would no doubt be dull on their own it certainly doesnt help that viewers familiar with Reeves winsome directorial debut ""Man of Tai Chi"" - the filming of which was partially responsible for one of the post-production delays suffered by ""47 Ronin - know full well what Reeves is capable of when left to his own devices. Every scene feels dramatically confused and abbreviated beyond recognition as if the prevailing ethos in the editing room was ""terrible food and such small portions."" While the film was supposedly taken away from Rinsch as soon as his DGA contract allowed the editing overseen by Universal co-chairwoman Donna Langley the butchered cut being dumped in theaters does nothing to suggest that production yielded footage required to piece together a decent movie. Indeed the project seems to have been doomed from the very beginning and can only be rationalized if you imagine that Universals executives were somehow cornered into a classic ""Brewsters Millions"" situation forced to unload an outrageous sum of money in order to collect on a greater fortune. But the refrain goes Throw enough money at anything and at some point it will start to feel like a good idea. Why with 175 million at your disposal you can actually afford to shoot this most cherished Japanese legend on location against the finest green screens in Hungary With that kind of budget you can go for broke and hire ""Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift"" scribe Chris Morgan the only screenwriter on the Universal lot who has definitely probably been to Japan They must have done a premiere screening there right? Of course the finished film is as disinterested in the Japanese characters as the production was in their country only a small handful of the 47 ronin ever being granted their own shot let alone a line of dialogue or a defining characteristic (my favorite was ""the fat one"" followed closely by ""the 46 skinny ones""). How can you not root for these guys? Morgan is one of two credited writers and ""Tokyo Drift"" is awesome. An Insufferably boring culturally hegemonic and profoundly ugly pastiche of action adventure the only conceivable value of this film is in how it exposes the cynicism and backwards thinking that has made Hollywood vulnerable to failures of this magnitude. Its not just that ""47 Ronin"" is very bad but that its hard to imagine how it possibly could have been any good. The film effectively recasts other blockbuster disasters in a positive light lacking the scale of studio pariah ""John Carter"" or the visual dexterity of Gore Verbinskis bloated but sporadically brilliant take on ""The Lone Ranger"". Slightly older fiascos like ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" or ""Cutthroat Island"" even with their box office receipts adjusted for inflation left a certain artistic flair in their wake - this isnt to suggest that those particular examples are good movies only that its possible to imagine how their makers were convinced that they had the potential to be. The most tempting comparison is to call ""47 Ronin"" the ""Heavens Gate"" of the CG era but ""Heavens Gate"" - to say nothing of its recent critical reevaluation - was Michael Ciminos follow-up to ""The Deer Hunter"" while ""47 Ronin"" is Carl Erick Rinschs follow-up to a typically handsome but unexceptional sci-fi short that sparked a Hollywood bidding war. The biggest difference is that genius was never on the table here. Cimino and his ilk were permitted their excesses because the film industry was leashed to their visions Hollywood motivated by profit but still convinced of possibility. While the director-driven system was fueled by hubris ""47 Ronin"" proves that hubris is certainly preferable to mediocrity. 175 is an absurd sum of money but its not the number that offends so much as how little was achieved with it. Adjusted for inflation ""Heavens Gate"" cost 157 million which is almost 75 million less than the 225 million Universal admits to have ultimately spent on the production ""47 Ronin"" (to say nothing of the marketing money that followed a fortune spent on a funeral). Theres a bit in Steve Ericksons great novel ""Zeroville"" in which a character suggests that ""Heavens Gate"" was ultimately a good version of a grand movie. Its easy to imagine that same character furiously dismissing ""47 Ronin"" as a cataclysmic version of a terrible movie. Those pivotal differences in ambition and potential notwithstanding ""Heavens Gate"" was such a spectacular failure that it forced the film industry to change the way it did business. If were lucky ""47 Ronin"" will do the same. It was only this past summer that Steven Spielberg arrived at the opening of a new USC School of Cinematic Arts building as a herald of doom lamenting the Hollywood machines over-reliance on massive blockbusters into which they poured all of their resources tentpoles without a tent. He soberly cautioned the crowd in his keynote speech that ""Theres eventually going to be an implosion -- or a big meltdown. Theres going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even a half-dozen mega-budget movies are going to go crashing into the ground and thats going to change the paradigm."" After watching ""47 Ronin"" Spielbergs words sound less like a warning than they do a hopeful glimpse of a brighter future. Burn Hollywood burn.
