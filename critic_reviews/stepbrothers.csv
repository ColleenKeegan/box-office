Making no pretense of setting the comedic bar particularly high ""Brothers"" is more notable for its cast than anything coming out of their mouths. The starting lineup includes former NFL star Michael Strahan and wheelchair-bound comic Daryl Chill Mitchell as the programs squabbling siblings CCH Pounder as their imperious mother and the inspired choice of Carl Weathers as their slightly daft dad. Theres actually a modicum of chemistry among that quartet. If only the laugh lines in the shows playbook yielded an actual laugh. Bringing only sportscasting experience from Foxs NFL pregame show to the party Strahan stars capably enough as Mike Trainor who is summoned home to Houston after a pro football career to again take up residence with his folks. They own a local bar and Mikes celebrity will theoretically help generate traffic as the venture faces tough times. The prodigal sons return however doesnt sit well with brother Chill (Mitchell) who resents Mike -- a hostility he expresses repeatedly via a series of tired one-liners. Mitchell delivers them reasonably well but other than the gag about his mom testing his paralysis by jabbing his thigh with a fork most viewers will be able to intercept the jokes well before he delivers him. (The character was injured in a car accident; Mitchell -- whose sitcom credits include ""Veronicas Closet"" -- was paralyzed in a 2001 motorcycle crash.) Pounder keeps the peace as their mother Adele and given her association with various dramas (most recently ""The Shield"") dives right into this comedic part putting that trademark glower to as much use as she can. Everything about ""Brothers"" speaks to its modest ambitions including a second episode (the two will air back to back to create a one-hour launch) in which Mikes one-night stand yields a predictable tirade about violating ""house rules"" -- even though he purchased said house for the family with his football-gotten gains. Its been awhile since a comedy has made any headway on Friday night -- or for that matter a live-action sitcom has gained any Nielsen yardage on Fox. From that perspective this qualifies as a recession-era choice driven as much by marketing as creative concerns Fox clearly hopes that a modest urban audience might be available and looking for something undemanding heading into the weekend while the football component offers obvious tie-ins and the potential for guest shots by other Fox Sports personalities. While the idea doubtless looked good on the chalkboard ""Brothers"" turns out to be all game plan and no game. BrothersFox Fri.

"Review Step Brothers full of funny stuff - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Step Brothers full of funny stuffStory Highlights Review ""Step Brothers"" is Will Ferrells funniest film since ""Talladega Nights"" Film re-teams Ferrell with John C. Reilly; two play step-brothers at odds Much gross-out humor but its hilarious says CNN.coms Tom Charity Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Stop me if youve heard this one before but producer Judd Apatow has another hit comedy on his hands. This time its ""Step Brothers"" an astute no-brainer thats also Will Ferrells funniest effort since ""Talladega Nights."" Will Ferrell left and John C. Reilly right play in-laws who find themselves at odds. Its no coincidence that Ferrell is back with the ""Talladega"" team ""Anchorman"" director Adam McKay and co-star John C. Reilly. All three share a story credit while Ferrell and McKay are listed as co-writers. In ""Step Brothers"" Ferrell is Brennan Huff a 40-year-old virgin (probably) who still lives with his mom Nancy (Mary Steenburgen). Reilly is Dale (""Call me Dragon"") the equally immature son of Dr. Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins). When Nancy and Robert get married the new siblings make no effort to conceal their hostility. These arent middle-aged sad-sacks so much as overgrown teenagers -- Wayne and Garth with curlier hair. They wear Yoda T-shirts dream of rock stardom and get their jollies over back issues of ""Good Housekeeping."" When Robert really has to get tough -- much too late obviously -- he bans them from watching TV. Watch the stars explain themselves >> Its tempting to see this as a not-so-subtle swipe at the dominant moviegoing demographic the hormonally mixed-up teenage male just as ""Talladega Nights"" took its pokes at NASCAR fans. But if Ferrell and company like to bite the hand that feeds them the mockery is decidedly indulgent. Like Adam Sandler Jerry Lewis and so many other comics before them Ferrells childish antics tap an underlying innocence -- even when hes well desecrating Dales drum kit (Ill leave it to you to see how). Dont Miss iReport.com What did you think? Send us your reviews The real enemy of ""Step Brothers"" is Brennans egregiously successful younger brother Derek (Adam Scott) a superconfident go-getter whose mercenary brand of ingratiating narcissism makes him a parental favorite -- and unites Bren and Dale in their loathing. Anyone who has boys in the house (or used to be one) will find plenty to wince at here. The peevish put-downs overweening sense of entitlement and volcanic temper tantrums could all hit uncomfortably close to home if Ferrell and Reilly didnt appreciate the ridiculous side of adolescent angst. A couple of spookily anarchic sleepwalking episodes up the ante still further -- unleashing a surrealistic impulse that feeds into Jon Brions supple eclectic score. While old pros Steenburgen and Jenkins sketch in enough detail to suggest where the family dynamics have gone awry and why the step-brothers would fight to save their marriage the film never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously. McKay runs away from sentimentality with every ironic fiber he can muster. The laughs tail off a little when the boys decide to put aside childish things and earn their keep -- as they must -- but this is just a temporary blip. Faced with the sensible course -- say opening a car rental franchise -- or facing his fears and opening his lungs before a crowd of important personages Brennan proves that there is still hope. In at least one line of work -- showbiz -- you never do have to grow up. Unremittingly juvenile and irredeemably funny ""Step Brothers"" is conclusive proof of that. ""Step Brothers"" runs 112 minutes and is rated R. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

But as the family unit is threatened enmity turns to armistice and finally to embarrassingly overaffectionate brotherly love. Tightly scripted by Ferrell and McKay the film lacks the improvisational spark that made Talladega and Anchorman so fresh. But it has energy to spare a great line in bone-crunching slapstick and the easy charm of two comic leads at the peak of their game. An excellent supporting cast also pull their weight notably Adam Scott as awesomely vile overachiever Derek and Kathryn Hahn as his desperate wife Alice who walks away with the films most disturbed brilliant scene.Some awkward shifts into grossout territory- including Ferrell sporting a pair of very fake rubber testicles - dont exactly raise the tone and there are moments when the prospect of watching two grown men act like spiteful adolescents for 90 minutes seems a big ask. But Ferrell is no Robin Williams and even with a last-act shift into emotional territory the film never becomes mawkish. Despite some obvious flaws Step Brothers remains a hugely enjoyable well-constructed slice of lowbrow Saturday night entertainment leaving Ferrells position as the reigning king of US comedy secure for a while longer.

""Boy A"" stars Andrew Garfield as a young Englishman who calls himself Jack Burridge. In fact Jack was the infamous Boy A convicted of murdering a child when he himself was no more than a child. Now released from juvenile prison and ready for a kind of rebirth hes told by his devoted caseworker Terry (Peter Mullan) that the past is moot and the present is all that matters. But the story makes the opposite case. The young mans past is always with him; the question is whether it will overwhelm him. The film deals with that question dramatically without turning the events of Jacks new life into a polemic -- its style is a sort of kitchen-sink lyricism -- and at the same time philosophically without belaboring the issues his life poses. When we first see Jack hes fairly vibrating with wonderment and hope as he stares at a getting-out-of-jail gift Terry has given him - a new pair of sneakers. Soon he starts a modest job with an employer who knows that hes an ex-offender though not the nature of his offense and has a tender love affair with a co-worker (played affectingly by Katie Lyons). Jack is an appealing figure working his way through an adult world he doesnt understand. But our sense of him changes and darkens as flashbacks fill in some of the details of his blighted childhood -- his friendship with a deeply disturbed boy their casual partnership of violence. Andrew Garfields phenomenal performance makes room for the many and various pieces of Jacks personality whether or not theyre securely fastened together. Sometimes Jack seems almost spectral or eerily feral. (I wouldnt be surprised if the actor and his brilliant director John Crowley had studied Truffauts ""The Wild Child."") At other times his latent violence breaks through the surface and those sneakers seem all too prescient a gift given the demons he keeps trying to flee. ENLARGE Peter Mullan and Andrew Garfield in John Crowleys Boy A. The Weinstein Company The production is of a piece -- a quality piece -- from start to finish. Peter Mullan formidable actor that he always is plays Terry as a passionate but rigid advocate who wants to see in Jacks progress the justification for his own life. Rob Hardy did the elegantly austere cinematography and Mark ORowe adapted the script from a novel by Jonathan Trigell. The story has echoes of the case of James Bulger an English toddler who was murdered in Liverpool in 1993 and a crucial irony evokes a somewhat similar plot point in ""A History of Violence."" The regional accents are heavy so careful attention is required. But theres so much to pay attention to. ""Boy A"" is a small huge film about the harsh realities of rehabilitation and the shimmering possibility of redemption. Baghead ""Baghead"" a very short and cheerfully scruffy comedy-thriller by the Duplass brothers Jay and Mark starts with a couple of marginally talented young actors who figure that anyone can make a movie so they will too and kickstart their careers in the process. Many movies are made by marginally talented people with big-studio backing and vast technical resources. But these guys Matt and Chad are positioned on the lowest level of the independent film movement where the only resources needed are fevered brains and a camcorder borrowed from someones parents. The movie they try to make is a horror story about a man with a bag over his head. The movie the Duplass brothers have made is a parody of indie films with special reference to ""The Blair Witch Project"" as well as a horror-ish entertainment with a silly-ish payoff. Still the cast is engaging Steve Zissis and Ross Partridge as the aspiring cineastes Greta Gerwig and Elise Muller as their girlfriends. And the muddle-headed development process as practiced by Matt and Chad has a ring of authenticity. Ill bet Ive reviewed other movies made by those guys.

Brideshead Revisited Twenty-six years ago Evelyn Waughs ""Brideshead Revisited"" was given the royal treatment on British TV -- an enthralling 11 -- episode miniseries starring Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews that still stands as one of the finest examples of a distinguished genre. Now the novel has spawned a feature film and the mystery is why; the world didnt need a superficial big-screen adaptation of a rich dense book thats about among many other things the passage of time. The perplexity is why the film is so lifeless and remote. A clue to that lifelessness comes early when were told of the hero Charles Ryder that the one emotion he can call his own is guilt. We are told that as if the filmmakers dont trust us to discover it on our own. But the lack of trust runs deeper and wider. The film keeps insisting on the picturesque and the eccentric as if the aristocrats and would-be aristocrats of Waughs elegiac novel will mean nothing to us unless theyre seen as spectacle. The concern is self-fulfilling of course. The performances are mostly inert except for Emma Thompsons Lady Marchmain (who looks like Barbara Stanwyck in her later years) and Michael Gambons Lord Marchmain who brings welcome gusto to the part played by Laurence Olivier in the miniseries but who sells what hes doing as Olivier never did. If its a choice between the movies 135 minutes or the 659 minutes of the miniseries (which has been re-mastered and re-released in a lavish four-disk edition) Id say its no choice at all. The shorter version is the one that seems long. Step Brothers ""Step Brothers"" stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly as petulant profane children who still live at home with single parents even though one of the two is pushing 40 and the other has already pushed through it. (The parents are played by Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen. Good actors have bills to pay too.) When the parents marry their sons become the step brothers of the title and then quarrel scheme and bond. Theres a good subject for satire here the extended adolescence of American kids. But satire presupposes maturity or at least some perspective. The movies calculation is that its subjects and audience share the same point of view. The results are truly ghastly.

"Reilly Ferrell are more like the wrong Brothers - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Reilly Ferrell are more like the wrong Brothers Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Mark Seliger Columbia Pictures Amigos in argyle But Will Ferrell left and John C. Reilly hate each other at first when their parents get married. ABOUT THE MOVIEStep Brothers (out of four)Stars Will Ferrell John C. Reilly Richard Jenkins Mary SteenburgenDirector Adam McKayDistributor Columbia PicturesRating R for crude and sexual content and pervasive languageRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesOpens Friday nationwide SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY America loves dysfunctional families but havent we seen enough middle-aged losers who havent grown up? We know Will Ferrell can carry a hilarious movie (Anchorman) as can John C. Reilly (the underrated Walk Hard). And Ferrell and Reilly do have considerable comic chemistry together as we saw in Talladega Nights. So that raises our hopes for this second joint effort. Adding to high expectations an eclectic supporting cast with Richard Jenkins (The Visitor) as Reillys father (and Ferrells stepfather) and Mary Steenburgen as Ferrells mom (and Reillys stepmother). Adam Scott has some sharply humorous moments as Ferrells brother though his character gets old fast. The concept is inherently funny Each is a self-absorbed brat living at home sponging off his parent and generally acting like an overgrown 13-year-old. When their single parents fall in love and marry they are forced to share a room. They squabble bond job-hunt and cause problems with their parents. But the plot grows thin and the laughs grow fewer once the premise is established. One problem the stepbrothers similarity. They come off as almost the same person so generating conflict becomes nearly impossible. Certifiably funny bits are interspersed with juvenile jokes centering on bathroom habits flatulence and vomiting. It seems Ferrell and Reilly are having lots of fun but thats not always communicated to the audience. Some gags go on too long or are simply too forced. A scene at the dinner table featuring all the family has some funny moments but it doesnt come close to the hilarity of the extended dinner in Talladega (with the infamous discussion of baby Jesus and grace). Like a few other comedies in recent memory this feels it should have been a Saturday Night Live skit rather than a full-length film.

"Step Brothers Unrelenting idiocy | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentStep Brothers Unrelenting idiocy Embrace your inner child. Never lose your love of fart-related humour creative variations of common swear words or masturbating to nudie magazines. Never grow up and leave home get a job or a girlfriend. Itll all work out in the end.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. July 25 2008(out of 4)Starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Directed by Adam McKay. 106 minutes. At major theatres. 14AEmbrace your inner child. Never lose your love of fart-related humour creative variations of common swear words or masturbating to nudie magazines. Never grow up and leave home get a job or a girlfriend. Itll all work out in the end.That sums up the simple message of Step Brothers a movie of unrelenting idiocy featuring boorish behaviour unrealistic character development and ludicrous plotting.If this movie makes more than 100 million the decline of Western civilization is just over the horizon. Really its just a matter of time.Article Continued BelowHowever if your lips move as youre reading this review this movie may be for you.Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are actually two funny (and funny-looking) guys. So who can blame them for concocting the story along with director Adam McKay producing a screenplay and then acting in it? (Acting out might be more accurate.)Quite a bit of it they tell us in interviews is improvised. It shows.Ferrell has scored box-office gold with a string of films including Old School; Reilly had less success with Walk Hard. Both starred in Talladega Nights. Those movies were kind of funny and had some redeeming qualities. This one hardly has any. But if you want to plunk down money to watch drivel masquerading as satire or slapstick comedy hey thats free enterprise.The plot involves two middle-aged morons Dale (Reilly) and Brennan (Ferrell) brought together under the same roof when Dales father marries Brennans mother.At first they hate each other. Then they realize they have a lot in common - sleepwalking nudie magazines their love of velociraptors - so they become like real brothers.Later on when the marriage of their respective parents falls apart they hate each other again but then are forced to grow up and get jobs. They learn a valuable lesson and everybody ends up happy.Along the way they yell and swear a lot break things and get beaten up by a gang of mean kids that make one of them eat dog poo.While the movie trailer has most of the funnier moments a few others simply could not be broadcast on public airwaves including a ""tea bagging"" incident unrelated to orange pekoe and a joke about blind people that should offend everyone without discrimination. If this still sounds appealing to you and you actually have a girlfriend for goodness sake dont bring her to this movie. She wont be able to look you in the eye afterward and will probably stop returning your phone calls. She might even move.Though if by some miracle she does like the movie well youre made for each other. Go ahead and tie the knot right away. Just dont rush into starting a family. Please.Read more about Will FerrellThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Reilly in Step Brothers. Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME John C. Reilly has just told his new roommate Will Ferrell that he must never ever touch Reillys precious drum kit. So as soon as Reilly is out of the house Ferrell tiptoes into the sanctum opens his pants and rubs his scrotum on the surface of the snare drum. Taking revenge on a hated rival its a moral imperative for great warriors 8-year-old boys silverback gorillas and the heroes of modern comedies. Ferrells nut-job is also about as close as any male character in Step Brothers comes to sexual release. OK I surrender. Tell your friends the grumpy old man finally gets it. After years of arguing and analyzing I now officially concede that movie comedy is meant to be always and only about men behaving at an IQ and/or age level far below expectations; that movie courtship is a process of stumbling into sex not the suave negotiation of seduction; and that after decades when Hollywood offered the likes of Clark Gable Cary Grant and Steve McQueen were the emblems of masculinity it now proposes the mentally and emotionally challenged oaf as dreamboat. What woman could look at Ferrell in this scene without salivating and thinking ""I want to be his snare drum""? Step Brothers is the latest chapter in Ferrells exploration of the man who is not nearly as cool as he thinks he is. (Thats a figure familiar for decades through Bob Hope and Steve Martin films and in TV shows like Get Smart.) With a story assist from Reilly Ferrell wrote the script with Adam McKay a fellow alumnus of Saturday Night Live and director of two Will winners Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. The new movie also explores the comic notion of man-child that goes back to the silent era (Harry Langdons basic character was that of a deranged baby) and early talkies (the Three Stooges). But today theyre everywhere -- Ferrell played a pretty endearing one in Elf -- which leaves the few remaining adult-male comedy roles to George Clooney. The answer is ingenious and unsettling which is just fine in an anarcho-sentimentalist comedy. But much of the raillery in Step Brothers seems lazy or desperate. The Ferrell character lacks the goofy appeal of Ricky Bobby or the skater in Blades of Glory. And Ill take the comedy stylings of Jon Heder over Reillys drabber improvisations any day. (Reilly was way funnier with Ferrell and Jon Stewart on The Daily Show Tuesday night than he is here.) Finally Ferrell the Hollywood star most notorious for going naked in his movies shows off only his belly and that for a teasing second. For most of the rest of the time youll be reveling in or enduring one more exhibition of grown men playing children of idiots destroying things. Misfits Fit The story Sprightly 60-somethings Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins) and Nancy Huff (Mary Steenburgen) meet at a medical conference and instantly fall in lust. One a widower the other a divorcee the two get married and move into his place. The catch is that each of the newlyweds has a wayward layabout son whos near 40 Dale Doback (Reilly) and Brennan Huff (Ferrell). Seemingly deficient in intelligence and lacking the most rudimentary of social skills Dale and Brennan feel hate at first sight as quickly as their parents found love. Their resentment comes from territorial rivalry but even more the fear that their comfortable situation of being the sole object of a parents pampering is over right now. Learn to share -- thats the implicit command. Play well with others. Two words grow up. In this large suburban home the lads are forced to share a bedroom. Its the sort of improbability that is waved away in comedy plots. Or maybe its part of the larger conceit that all narratives are simply the clothes hangers for splendid jokes most of which are thrown on the closet floor anyway. After a lot of sparring and territory-marking Brennan and Dale realize theyre soulmates agreeing on nearly everything including which guy theyd want to have sex with if they were a chick. (Together ""John Stamos"") Their parents are still flummoxed by the boys now-cheerful immaturity -- Robert and Nancys sighs are an extended joke on the smiling exasperation of liberal parenting -- but the Brennan-Dale thing is clearly a match made in kindergarten. The misfits fit.

Directed by Adam McKay. With Will Ferrell John C. Reilly. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey.TWO AND A HALF STARS Dale lives with his dad loves martial arts and ""Star Wars"" and enjoys escaping to his treehouse. Brennan lives with his mom is fond of singing and unicorns and is really proud of his nacho recipe. But then Dales dad falls in love with Brennans mom and the two families blend. Awkward. And whats really awkward? Brennan is 39. Dale is 40. And when these two perpetual adolescents find they have to share their parents -- and a room -- the bad feelings break out into an orgy of nasty noogies and I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I verbal attacks. Thats the pretty funny starting point for ""Step Brothers"" an offbeat -- and defiantly off-color -- comedy starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly as these two messed-up man-children. And although the comedy is a little messed-up and childish itself it still delivers a few good laughs. A few bad ones too and plenty of cringes. If youre the kind of person who roars at closeups of dog excrement enjoys a good flatulence joke and begins every Will Ferrell movie looking forward to the moment hell drop trou -- well then this is the movie for you. If not well ""Brideshead Revisited"" is playing across the hall. COLUMBIA PICTURESWill Ferrell left and John C. Reilly in ""Step Brothers."" But even if youre not a fan of watching Reilly throw up or Ferrell sit on the toilet -- and those are pleasures Ive never claimed myself -- the movie still contains some good jokes. Credit Ferrell and Reilly for most of them as they not only commit to the material but really give these adult children a kind of plausibility (one day this will make a good triple feature with ""Big"" and ""13 Going on 30.""). Credit Richard Jenkins too loosening up after ""The Visitor"" as Dales exasperated father. (Less utilized -- typical unfortunately of these testosterone-pumped comedies -- are the women including Mary Steenburgen as Brennans mother.) There are some wonderful scenes as Dale and Brennan go from feuding (with profane insults and violent pranks) to goofy bonding (complete with karate competitions and bunk beds). And Brennans creepy yuppie brother Derek has a great introduction (even if the ""creepy yuppie"" character is by now feeling kind of 90s.) But the movie like most comedies these days is occasionally as flawed and messy as its characters. And I blame its parents -- star Will Ferrell and producer Judd Apatow. Like most Ferrell farces this is a moron movie -- the kind of picture that rather than daring you to recognize yourself in the characters lets you merely feel superior to them. ""These guys"" you think watching them sponge off their parents. ""What a pair of morons"" Its the cheapest safest kind of laugh. Like most Apatow movies the films also a little long and undisciplined counting on the editing to pave over any problems. It doesnt always. Its unclear from scene to scene whether Dale and Brennan are just immature or seriously disturbed; a third-act crisis comes too late and is resolved too easily. Yet unlike most Apatow movies -- particularly ""Knocked Up"" and ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" -- its missing a saving sense of sweetness. Those movies had actual rueful romances at their raunchy core. This one -- directed by a long-time Ferrell partner -- just has the raunch. That will probably be enough for many audiences -- and Ferrell and Reilly who have both hit dry spells recently are undoubtedly hoping so. But if you want a little more from your comedies than morons and male nudity you might want to give these childish ""Step Brothers"" a time out. Rating note The film contains constant crude humor strong language nudity and violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Before the blessed light of ""Step Brothers"" entered my life I knew not the sweet comedic splendors of live burial bunk-bed catastrophe or a minivan family singing ""Sweet Child O Mine"" in four-part harmony. PHOTO GALLERY Step Brothers Will Ferrell plays Brennan (""You can call me . . . Nighthawk"") and John C. Reilly is Dale (""Call me Dragon"") two unemployed full-grown manboys who each live with a widowed single parent. Brennan mooches off mom Nancy (Mary Steenburgen who by the way is at age whatever in possession of a body that is fierce) Dale off dad Robert (Richard Jenkins of ""Six Feet Under"" who busts out a gift for deadpan that rivals Leslie Nielsens). When Nancy and Robert get married their live-in sons become stepbrothers and lo the foreheads of the worlds comedy writers did submit to a mighty thwacking as their owners begged the gods of japery ""Why didnt I think of that?"" There hasnt been this much fun under the same roof since the creation of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms. Instead of banging the same gong throughout though the writing team of Ferrell Reilly and director Adam McKay who is maybe the second hottest comedy helmer after Judd Apatow keeps trying new situations. The boys are alternately sworn foes BFFs and even sober job-holding adults. The only standing order comes from Reilly ""Were here to f - - k s - - t up"" Proclaim it sir ""Step Brothers"" is by a hair the funniest film Ive seen this year (over ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" which was a better movie overall) and at least as funny as McKays other ones ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights."" After fooling with night-vision goggles one of the manboys says ""Imagine if wed had these when we were 12."" ""Even better"" is the reply. ""We got them when were 40"" The concept of grown men acting like boys has been done so frequently that its nearly time for a shock-value comedy about grown men acting like grown men. But it has rarely been done properly with the correct degree of vulgarity social awkwardness scowly faced mystery aggression and Bruce Lee T-shirts. Boys are freaks. Picture Tom Hanks in a de-cornified ""Big"" Wouldnt his first move have been a mission for porn and beer? There is fascination with pretty ladies but a fog of unease when it comes to talking to them. There is much fighting - Brennan hits Dale with a bike - and the soft crackling of old bones as geezers are lightly tossed down flights of stairs. At a moment of detente Brennan (T-shirt Pablo Cruise) offers Dale (T-shirt Yoda a real classy one with Yodas face all shadowy) the chance to ride with him upon ""majestic and translucent steeds"" while Dale responds ""I will follow you through the mists of Avalon."" Brennan wants to sing but hes too shy to perform so Dale encourages him ""Your voice - its like a combination of Fergie and Jesus."" Brennans rich brother Derek (language sampler ""Bro"" ""Not gonna happen"" and ""It would be kickass"") who brags that he knows Jeff Probst becomes a hilarious foil as played by Adam Scott who has been popping up here and there for a few years but never made his mark before. Now hes hit on a role that can pay his wages for the next decade Hes not just a tool but a power tool. With its middle-age roommates failing to meet basic developmental milestones ""Step Brothers"" is like ""Waynes World"" and ""The Odd Couple"" taking a shower together under a soothing cascade of filthy language. There is too much funny here for a movie (even though it continues into the closing credits). ""Step Brothers"" should be a TV show. Given the limited career aspirations of its main characters the demotion would be fitting. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next MAD ABOUT VINCENT KARTHEISER Read Next MAD ABOUT VINCENT KARTHEISER Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16058 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Joe Neumaier Wednesday July 30 2008 353 PM If the idea of watching two grown men act like children - oversize shouting stomping mouth-full-of-Cheez Whiz 12-year-olds - was actually comedy gold Tom Hanks would be on his fourth ""Big"" sequel by now and Judge Reinhold would have rode a ""Vice Versa"" train all the way to retirement.Those things didnt happen of course and for good reason Watching people act like kids is annoying. Now everyone can join in the un-fun with ""Step Brothers"" Will Ferrells latest summed-up-in-one-line concept comedy that tests our patience so much more than his previous movies did. Ferrell and John C. Reilly bring a frightening level of believability to two guys who for no stated reason never grew up. Ferrell is Brennan a 39-year-old layabout; Reilly is Dale a. ... 40-year-old layabout. After Brennans mom (Mary Steenburgen) marries Dales dad (Richard Jenkins) the ""boys"" pout fight prank each other and eventually become compadres - until theyre forced to get mature get jobs and turn into boring adults. This is the kind of movie that assumes its uber-silly that the main characters wear T-shirts featuring Yodas face or 70s umbrella-drink-band Pablo Cruise across their paunchy guts. There are in fact three whole chuckles in the movie and its not spoiling anything to say they involve a George W. Bush quote a bunk bed collapsing on Ferrell and the choice of Andrea Bocellis pop-opera hit ""Con te Partiro"" for the big climax. A goofy Ferrell crooning without shame is as much a part of his repertoire as getting naked or slamming himself into walls for a laugh. But laughter isnt the result here; exhaustion is the more precise reaction. Its delayed a bit by the slurring jokiness of Reilly who backed up Ferrell in 2006s better-written ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" and who seems to have taken his co-stars ""Act like a man-child earn top dollar"" seminar (Reilly tried it first in last years ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story""). ""Step Brothers"" does give the amiable Jenkins a chance to let loose though Steenburgen is often left to fret over the lumpy galoots while Adam Scott does a weird out-of-left-field Tom Cruise imitation as Brennans successful sibling. Oh but there is a moment when Jenkins says the family has to move and Ferrell plunked in front of the TV stiffly mutters ""... Is the house haunted?"" So thats three snickers not counting the Bush quote cause including that one aint fair man. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Judd Apatow -- wasnt he responsible for some funny movies a long time ago? Their suffocatingly stupid comedy ""Step Brothers"" hellbent on destroying every last brain cell that wasnt exterminated by ""Semi-Pro"" and ""Drillbit Taylor"" makes it near-impossible to recall their glory days. I wish I could forget the new movie as easily. Ferrell stars with John C. Reilly as 40-year-old men with the minds social skills and emotional maturity of spoiled 9-year-olds. Why? Did they fall off the roof and hit their heads? Are they ironic man-child representatives of a lost generation? The script provides no answers. My hunch They are the product of screenwriters bent on the downfall of Western civilization. The peabrains respective single parents Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins meet cute at a medical convention where Jenkins goes off-script from his presentation about implantable hearing aids and begins babbling about Steenburgens delectable bosom. A few clumsy edits later they are married and Reilly and Ferrell share a bedroom and battle for alpha brother status. They sulk they glare they trade third-grade insults they tussle clumsily in a debacle that must have been pitched as ""Rain Man meets ""The Brady Bunch."" Ferrells smug successful brother Adam Scott visits the newly blended family and then ... oh who am I kidding? There is no plot no sense symmetry or structure to this train wreck. A word processor is inadequate to review it. Nothing short of a flamethrower would do justice to this shoo-in for the Comedy Hall of Infamy. In place of actual jokes the stars wear ironic T-shirts in scene after scene. The brothers have a blind neighbor who appears for a single scene and is completely superfluous to the story. But blind guys are funny you know? The best parts of the film would barely fill a 2-minute skit on Ferrells FunnyOrDie website. You wonder why they thought the other 93 minutes of poop humor would hold our attention. Maybe the real goal of the movie isnt to provide laughs but to inspire schadenfreude. In filmic terms its like those supermarket tabloid stories that show a celebrity whos been busted doing something scandalous and stupid. The scene of Ferrell marking Reillys drum set with his spunky male scent (dont ask how it isnt pretty) surely will be shown for eternity at Ferrells Celebrity Roast in Hades. STEP BROTHERS  out of 4 stars Rating R for crude and sexual content and pervasive language. ""Brothers"" showtimes In a perverse way the film is an ego booster for audiences. Watching this cavalcade of aggressive immaturity produced by Apatow (""Superbad"" ""Knocked Up"") and directed by Adam McKay (""Anchorman"" ""Talladega Nights"") is guaranteed to make anyone feel really smart in comparison.

Reillys silly crass comedy with carrying the ""Step Brothers"" gag as far as they do before backsliding into a finale that lets an absurd conceit turn slack. Actually the duo themselves are the goofball brains behind this lark along with Ferrells partner in comedy director-writer Adam McKay. tagsibling hijinks Last seen onscreen as best friends then NASCAR frenemies in McKays ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" Ferrell and Reilly play Brennan Huff and Dale Doback two layabouts forced to live under one roof when their single parents fall in love and marry. While the actors dont really look alike there is something symbiotically je nais se quoi about them that makes the setup delicious. They play well against each other. More gifted -- comedically and dramatically -- than the material finally accommodates they still deliver moments of deft timing and stoopid laughs. The sharpest writing comes quickly when Nancy Huff and Dr. Robert Doback meet at a medical conference and Brennan and Dale get to know-hate each other. What could have been a heated booty call becomes something deeper when each learns the other has a grown-up son still living at home. Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins bring sweet calibrated gravitas to the two successful parents confounded by their boys. And the movie teases denial and enabling. Only child Dale is the meaner one. But theyre both off their tiny rockers. Brennans retaliatory strike against Dales beloved drum set proves he can give as good as he gets. Its also an appalling nod to the jests of Judd Apatow one of the comedys producers. Much of the fun comes in watching two developmentally arrested 12- year-olds go at it in 40-year-old bodies. Their stunted vocabulary makes a furious fresh discovery of cursing with f-bombs nearly decimating the R-rated script. When they first meet on a suburban lawn like gunslingers Dale sports a black T-shirt with Yoda peering out. Brennan wears a just-as-retro Pablo Cruise tee. Who needs sartorial splendor? Clothes unmake the man. Early on someone asks Dale what he does. ""Manage a baseball team"" he answers. ""Little League?"" ""Fantasy."" Not to smear the gamesmanship of millions of avid fantasy sport aficionados but in the case of these boneheads the Neverland aspect is all too clear. Dale and Brennan are Peter Pans gone to seed. Neither one works. They live in a world dreamed up by popular culture. Wendys plural show up in the guise of overly desperate stepsister-in-law Alice (Kathryn Hahn) and later Brennans appalled therapist. Played by Adam Scott Brennans younger brother Derek is a name-dropping success at selling corporate helicopters. Dr. Doback is smitten with him. Jenkins so beloved in the indie sleeper ""The Visitor"" captures the swoon of a father glad to have found a functional son. In the spirit of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" Dale and Brennan become fast allies. Other glues that bond them a porn collection; a treehouse; Marion Zimmer Bradleys ""The Mist of Avalon."" Their new adoration is as looney as their fury was and more destructive. But the unraveling isnt as smartly written as the setup. And because the characters beyond the parents and boys arent as finely tuned the film starts to lag. Note to John Stamos Watch your back. Dale and Brennan agree youre one more thing they have in common.

By Peter Rainer July 26 2008 Save for later Saved John C. Reilly (left) and Will Ferrell test the limits of loserliness in the comedy Step Brothers. STEPHEN VAUGHAN/WARNER BROS. PICTURES           View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Step Brothers Before their latest comedy ""Step Brothers"" Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly last teamed up for ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" which I was somewhat alone in rating less than a laugh riot. Both Ferrell and Reilly were playing winners - at least in their own minds - and that stunted the comedy. These guys are best when they are playing losers.Still there are limits to loserliness and ""Step Brothers"" oversteps them. Ferrell plays Brennan Huff a mostly out-of-work layabout who lives with his overly indulgent single mom (Mary Steenburgen). Reilly equally loafy lives with his exasperated doctor father (Richard Jenkins). When the parents marry the boys - er men - are required to live together in the same house. In the same room. Can bunk beds be very far behind?The idea of two grown men acting like stunted 14-year-olds is amusing enough and Ferrell has a few classic bug-eyed loony moments such as when he reluctantly sings a song and gasps at the angelic sounds coming out of his mouth. Reilly is a good foil for Ferrell but too many of their scenes together have the effect of improv night at the comedy club. Director Adam McKay is a veteran of the Judd Apatow school of R-rated gross-out gooniness but this latest installment in the canon is decidedly underpowered. Grade C+ (Rated R for crude and sexual content and pervasive language.)

"Step Brothers is crude rude -- and funny - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Step Brothers is crude rude -- and funny John C. Reilly (left) and Will Ferrell are grown men who have to live together when their parents get married in the gross-out comedy ""Step Brothers."" (Gemma La Mana/columbia pictures) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / July 25 2008 A clarification is in order. Despite the movies R rating the trailers for ""Step Brothers"" make it look like fun for more or less the entire family what with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly pouting and sissy-fighting and building a bunk bed that collapses in on itself like an end-stage dark star.What the ads dont show you is Reilly crowing about his ""chest pubes"" and ""bush fro"" f-bombs detonated every five seconds and - la piece de anatomical resistance - Ferrell rubbing his testicles all over Reillys prized drum kit. Im assuming - actually Im praying - that stunt testicles were involved but still. Take the kids at your peril.Mismarketing aside ""Step Brothers"" is crudely funny which means that sometimes its crudely hilarious and more often its just crude. The movie directed by Ferrells ""Funny or Die"" web partner Adam McKay and written by him with the stars has one joke that it beats into the ground 40-year-old men acting like petulant 9-year-olds. Luckily Ferrell and Reilly were born with no shame or sense of personal dignity and they give good tantrum. Remember the old cartoon character Baby Huey a gigantic infant duck in a diaper? Now picture two of him.The movie pushes the notion of the ""boomerang generation"" - kids who graduate return home and never ever leave - until it breaks into slaphappy pieces. Ferrell plays Brennan Huff a flabby mamas boy; Reilly is his spiritual twin Dale Doback. Brennans mom Nancy (Mary Steenburgen - nice to see her back but whats with the spray-on tan?) meets Dales dad Robert (Richard Jenkins gleefully working the opposite side of the street from his subtle turn in ""The Visitor"") and after bonding over their mutual love of Rob Reiner movies the two professionals are smitten with late-life lust. Marriage ensues and the ""kids"" are forced to share a bedroom.In no universe can I imagine Will Ferrell ever issuing from Steenburgen but Jenkins and Reilly do make a plausible craggy-faced father and son. The comedy comes from the patient slow burn of the parents as they try to ignore the explosive belligerence of the boys which escalates early into a marvelously unhinged front-yard free-for-all. ""Today I saw my own son use a bicycle as a weapon"" murmurs Nancy in shock and awe.Eventually the filmmakers have to come up with a plot of some sort which leads to the appearance of Brennans successful younger brother Derek (Adam Scott) still a vengeful little sneak under the power suit. Not that you go to a movie like ""Step Brothers"" for its believability factor but when Dereks repressed wife (Kathryn Hahn) goes aggressively gaga for Dale the movie starts sliding off the rails. The ""Funny or Die"" mantra of quick-hit comedy threatens to die on the vine when extended to feature length.For every gross-out laugh that works then theres one (or three) that just lie there. The best bits rise out of the characters belief that theyre entitled to sit on the couch all day and scratch their crotches while dreaming footie-pajama dreams of fame. Ferrell paints the walls with his usual cross-eyed egotism while Reilly works the corners and gets the bigger guffaws. Occasionally ""Step Brothers"" delivers with such random drive-by surrealism that you have to laugh such as the scenes in which Dale and Brennan sleepwalk in tandem muttering non sequiturs and breaking the crockery.Actually the funniest person here just might be Rob Riggle as Dereks corporate second-in-command a blockheaded bully who yells cryptic team-spirit phonemes with desperate urgency. Elsewhere ""Step Brothers"" is content to push the giggles that come from shock. Its an ""Oh no they didnt"" comedy and proud of it A film made by little boys starring little boys and aimed at a culture of little boys of all ages and genders. As such it will prosper.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Step Brothers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; step-brothers ) Step Brothers (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli When did Will Ferrell stop being funny? It wasnt that long ago that this Saturday Night Live alum looked to be following in the footsteps of the likes of Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler but somewhere along the way Ferrells train derailed. Now once again paired with John C. Reilly he tries so hard and with so little effect to make us laugh that the result is almost physically painful. Few films are worse to sit through than comedies that dont work. Step Brothers is one of those. Humor is subjective but this movie made me feel as if I had been subjected to something unpleasant. Step Brothers is a one joke concept Ferrell and Reilly play 40-year old virgins who are little boys trapped in mens bodies. Mentally and emotionally theyre about eight years old and they act that way. Thats pretty much the entire film - two grown men acting like kids. The concept is amusing for about two minutes. Its the kind of thing that might sound funny in a pitch meeting but put into action theres not enough laugh-generating material here to fill a bad SNL skit. And its not as if the actors arent trying. Ferrell and Reilly give it their all and thats one reason its so sad to see them fail so utterly. Its the proverbial slow-motion train wreck. Step Brothers is rude crude and profane but not in a funny way. Jokes include discovering how Ferrell handles a situation when the toilet paper has run out a testicle rub on a drum set the worlds longest fart and other such side-splitting gags. (""Gag"" sometimes being the operative word.) The setup is simple. Nancy (Mary Steenburgen) and Robert (Richard Jenkins) meet and fall in love. They decide to get married but each brings baggage to the new family. Nancys son Brennan (Will Ferrell) is a Mammas Boy in the truest sense of the word. He has never cut the apron strings. Roberts son Dale (John C. Reilly) is in a similar boat. His dad has been his gravy train. At first the two new step brothers dont get along. Then when they find a common enemy in Brennans cocky overachieving younger brother (Adam Scott) they bond. And when Mom and Dad decide to sell the house its time for Dale and Brennan to look to the future and try to get jobs and maybe find girlfriends. The screenplay for Step Brothers is not completely devoid of intelligence although it comes close. The moments of cleverness are sprinkled lightly throughout and are threatened to be overwhelmed by the waste assailing them on all sides. The conclusion which effectively sends up the ""happy ending"" syndrome of most comedies is moderately amusing. Unfortunately its a case of too little too late. Most of those who would care about the satirical bent of the epilogue will have tuned out or walked out long ago. The first 90 minutes of Step Brothers are so unpleasant that a tolerable final eight hardly makes up for the time wasted to get there. Judd Apatow has his name on the film but Step Brothers failure in generating laughter or provoking us to care on any level about these two puerile annoying characters demonstrates that his reputation as a cinematic Midas of R-rated comedies is overrated. (No penises here but there are testicles - does that count?) Apatow is only listed as a producer not a writer. That credit goes to Ferrell and his longtime collaborator Adam McKay who also directs. Considering how ingrained Ferrells fingerprints are on everything to do with this movie its impossible to exonerate him of the stench. Step Brothers is as big a misstep as this ex-SNL giant has taken. Step Brothers (United States 2008) Director Adam McKay Cast Will Ferrell John C.

""Step Brothers"" the newest collaboration between Ferrell and writer-director Adam McKay produced by Judd Apatow takes this trend to its logical next step screaming infantilism.The title characters are Brennan Huff (Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C. Reilly). Though Brennan is 39 and the unemployed Dale is 40 both still live at home Brennan with his mom (Mary Steenburgen) and Dale with his doctor dad (Richard Jenkins). When the two parents fall in love and wed these two spoiled overgrown infants are thrown together in the same household and worse forced to share a room. Its hate at first sight. ""Dont ever touch my drum set"" wails the angry threatened Dale the more aggressive of the two. Brennan a big wounded teddy bear of a man does more than touch them. This being an anatomically revealing Apatow production he proceeds to desecrate them with his family jewels. With many of the ""jokes"" in ""Step Brothers""--both guys improbably are sleepwalkers who proceed to trash the house in their somnolent nighttime forays into the kitchen--you may find yourself wincing rather than laughing at the overgrown boys tantrums which threaten to destroy their parents marriage not to mention the audiences patience with these two pathologically selfish brats.That ""Step Brothers"" ultimately proves funnier and more tolerable than this premise suggests is largely a credit to the gifted and committed cast who manage to find little air bubbles of subtlety and pathos amidst the broad rumpus room humor. Even when the situations feel rickety and contrived the four principals find just enough emotional realism to keep the farce from going completely off track. And just when Dale and Brennans infantile bickering is about to wear out its noisy welcome Brennans sleek successful intolerably smug brother Derek (Adam Scott) arrives on the scene and the two mortal enemies bond in their mutual loathing of this snooty entrepreneur. They become allies though this is far from the end of story for their friendship proves almost equally destructive. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Still as amusing as ""Step Brothers"" can be it seems a regression in more ways than one after McKays ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" a high point along with ""Elf"" in the Ferrell comedy canon one hoped for more than this overextended ""Saturday Night Live""-style sketch. Though McKay and his cast--which includes the fearless Kathryn Hahn as the despicable Dereks randy frustrated wife whose ferocious come-ons to the dumbstruck Dale take lust to hilariously new levels--make the most of the material ""Step Brothers"" is constrained by its one-joke concept. The movie which begins by making fun of its hapless heroes infantilism ends by sentimentally celebrating it as if the only alternative to being a perpetual 13-year-old was dull soul-squelching conformist adulthood. This feels less like satire than pandering.I dont want to sound like a party pooper (or deny that there is something wickedly funny about seeing these middle-age adolescents beating the crap out of a playground full of little bullying kids) but theres something depressing about the never-ending celebration of eternal adolescence in recent American comedies. It would be useful to show ""Step Brothers"" on a double bill with Howard Hawks 1952 wild screwball comedy ""Monkey Business"" in which grown-ups Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers accidentally take a youth potion that turns them into giddy uninhibited teenagers. But at the end of the day in the Hawks movie you cant go home again.

Bush.""Its a line that got laughs and groans at the prerelease screening the other day and the laughs and groans kept coming - sometimes so fast and outrageously that it began to hurt - as the latest happily imbecilic Will Ferrell comedy proceeded to its goofball finale.Directed and cowritten by Adam McKay the Malvern-raised comedy mastermind who collaborated with Ferrell on Anchorman and Talladega Nights the loose-limbed Step Brothers makes room for dual leads Ferrell is Brennan Huff a 39-year-old slacker who still lives at home with his mom Nancy (Mary Steenburgen); John C. Reilly the sad-sack punching bag-faced character actor is Dale Doback a 40-year-old do-nothing who lives at home with his father Robert (Richard Jenkins).When Nancy and Robert meet and marry naturally they move in together. She brings her son along and so Brennan and Dale are forced to share a house and worse a bedroom.Two grown men in a state of arrested development waddling around in their underpants and pretty much hating the fact that their lives - not to mention ownership of the remote - have been upended by their respective parents marriage. If all this sounds hopelessly childish it is. But thats the idea. And Ferrell Reilly and company - Adam Scott as an overachieving sibling Kathryn Hahn as his unhappy spouse and the seriously funny Jenkins and Steenburgen - go at it with such dogged zeal that its hard not to be won over.Full of riffy improvised moments and a couple of jaw-droppingly raunchy sight gags (the movie has been rated R and deservedly so) the comedy follows a typical buddy-movie arc - conflict and loathing giving way to bonding and brotherhood or step-brotherhood in this case.While Ferrell and Reilly are great together hatching harebrained schemes that have no basis in reality (a global entertainment enterprise for one) part of the unexpected treat of Step Brothers is watching Jenkins and Steenburgen sink to such blithely immature levels of rude and crude comedy.Jenkins who could nab an Oscar nomination for his work in this seasons surprise art-house hit The Visitor can hardly keep a straight face amid all the slap-happy stupidity. And Steenburgen takes her characters delicate and dignified persona and upends it with a fountain of foul language. As evidenced by her cameos on Larry Davids Curb Your Enthusiasm Steenburgens got a deliciously twisted sense of humor and she fits splendidly into this dysfunctional-family-ensemble nonsense.

Seesawing from the gleefully stupid to the desperately stupid ""Step Brothers"" is an indicator that the Judd Apatow juggernaut -- which often includes star Will Ferrell and helmer Adam McKay (""Anchorman"" ""Talladega Nights"") -- has made one too many trips to the well. With Ferrell and John C. Reilly trying to outdo each other in impersonating self-absorbed middle-aged 6-year-olds the film is funny at times but lapses into the reflexive vulgarity that seems to be the default mechanism of the Apatow machinery. However the Sony late-summer entry should enjoy a decent opening. Despite the comedy ""Step Brothers"" has a rather tragic subtext Two accomplished professionals Nancy Huff and Robert Doback (a wonderful pairing Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins) discover the kind of passionate love at first sight thats normally the purview of movie teenagers. Theyre wildly attracted to each other and have a lot in common -- including 40-year-old sons who still live at home. How did these two nice people raise two cretins? Some questions have no answers. Despite a few promising gestures in the general direction of wit the comedy quickly becomes an exercise in antics that wouldnt even qualify as adolescent. The core of the humor in ""Step Brothers"" -- as it is in many Ferrell vehicles -- is all about a grown man acting juvenile. If Nancys son Brennan (Ferrell) were still going to school hed be riding an abbreviated yellow bus. Likewise Roberts son Dale (Reilly) dropped out of college to join the family business -- despite being told repeatedly by his physician father that Dale would need to be a doctor to do so. When Brennan moves into the Doback house and Dale refuses to move the inevitable drum set out of the one spare room the two are forced to bunk together becoming antagonists and fellow sleepwalkers. The first time they somnambulate together and trash their parents house is hilarious -- not so much the second time. And almost everything in ""Step Brothers"" is done a second time. Pic boasts an unpredictable element in that you never know what the two brothers are going to say. (The script is by Ferrell and McKay but much of what Ferrell and Reilly blurt out seems ad-libbed.) On the other hand its predictable in the way it brings two enemies together -- mutual hatred of Brennans overachieving insufferable younger brother Derek (Adam Scott) plays a part -- and redeems them as semi-solid citizens. To be fair the unrelenting imbecility of Dale and Brennan generates a certain affection. Theres something going on in society that has to explain the popularity (and proliferation) of movies in which men play boys such as Apatow productions ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad."" Theres probably some deep answer to all this but dont ask Dale or Brennan. One will look at you blankly. The other will make armpit farts.

Reilly; Director Adam McKay; Author Will Ferrell Adam McKay; Release Date Wide 07/25/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Sony BMG Posted July 30 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT Even if Will Ferrell didnt keep returning to the same comedic topics (sports the 70s those odd fuzzy hairballs that dot his potbelly like ants) it would be easy to feel that hes begun to repeat himself because he revs so many scenes to the exact same pitch of satirical hysteria. In Step Brothers though he does something new. He plays a guy even further down the developmental food chain than usual -- a 40ish loser who still lives with his mother -- and he makes this walking punchline a hostile cussed mess with four-letter words shock-popping out of his mouth. Ferrells Brennan Huff is an overgrown 9-year-old whos always in mid-tantrum and so is John C. Reillys Dale Doback. The two become bunk-bed stepsiblings when their divorced parents (Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins) marry and for a while theyre mortal enemies and then (of course) buddies. At which point they really get cretinous. Step Brothers is a Judd Apatow production (though directed by Ferrells regular co-conspirator Adam McKay) and its the closest that the Apatow factory has come to spitting out a dumb-and-dumber high-concept comedy. Yet its not just an idiot revel Its nutty profane and caustically heartless. After Dale orders Brennan not to touch his drum set Brennan doesnt just sit down and play those drums -- he...well touches them. (Yes you see it all.) There are other yeasty bits from Brennans vile perfectionist of a biological brother (played with amusing Tom Cruise mannerisms by Adam Scott) leading his family in a hyper-controlled chorus of ""Sweet Child O Mine"" to the job interviews and therapy sessions that Brennan and Dale turn into kamikaze acts of self-sabotage. Step Brothers is hit-and-miss but it made me wish that the usual American comedy of how stupid can we get? had this much rage.

Will Ferrell left and John C. Reilly are shown in a scene from ""Step Brothers."" Photo Gemma La Mana Columbia Pictures Review Step Brothers - 40-year-old goobers 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""Step Brothers"" is not afraid to offer some freakish sights. Whens the last time you saw a pair of prosthetic testicles? Or a mother who looks roughly the age of her sons? Or two grown men acting and dressing like teenagers? Well man-children at the movies have been impossible to ignore over the past few years. ""Step Brothers"" starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly and directed by Adam McKay (""Talladega Nights"") is of course another Judd Apatow production. Apatow has cornered the market in exploring the psyche and behavior of adolescent men of all ages from the boys of ""Freaks and Geeks"" to the men of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" back to the boys of ""Superbad."" Hollywoods readiness to write Apatow a blank check however has meant the decline of his franchise. ""Step Brothers"" may be a step above ""Drillbit Taylor"" but not by much. But the prospect of Ferrell and Reilly mouthing off to each other as dueling losers will probably draw in at least some of the ""Superbad"" crowd. As a movie experience its not awful. The films disposition like past Ferrell and McKay collaborations ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" is generally sweet even if the language is determinedly foul. But ""Step Brothers"" is essentially a throwaway film one that might have gone straight-to-video if Apatow had not had such a hot hand. The premise as any billboard will tell you is that Brennan Huff (Ferrell) and Dale Doback (Reilly) are forced to live under the same roof when their parents Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins) and Nancy Huff (Mary Steenburgen) get married. They spend the first part of the movie hating each other then the second part loving each other and then the rest trying to get their parents who divorced in the wake of their friendship back together. Details matter in a comedy like this and some of them are spot-on. As befitting two 40-year-old men who live at home both Huff and Doback watch a lot of TV. Seeing them watch clips of Shark Week or VH1 reality show ""Rock of Love"" starring Bret Michaels never fails to make me laugh. Its a quick way to sketch the outline of their lives They are two men who are held in a teenage thrall to reality shows and Animal Planet which actually makes them like most Americans. The films finale takes place at the ""Catalina Wine Mixer"" where the featured entertainment is a Billy Joel cover band (""Uptown Girl"") that only plays Joel songs from the 80s. There is no doubting that the Catalina Wine Mixer is a very very very important event. As Huff and Doback Ferrell and Reilly clearly have chemistry - although perhaps not to the levels of verbal sword fighting displayed by Michael Cera and Jonah Hill in ""Superbad"" - but their characters are too poorly differentiated for the audience to care about whatever semblance of plot exists. The whole movie is an excuse to pack in as many insults and risque teenage bodily function jokes as possible. Fair enough. But even judged on those terms ""Step Brothers"" comes up short. Ferrell seems sluggish throughout; he doesnt even bother to take off his clothing and streak his trademark move. Reilly jumps into his role with the zeal of a Method actor - no fear about sporting tiny underroos for the bulk of his screen time - but he sometimes comes off as more scary than funny. The scene-stealing then is left to Adam Scott who plays the smarmy other brother Derek Huff. With a sleek earpiece permanently clipped to his face Scott eats up the screen He bears an uncanny resemblance to Tom Cruise as the motivational speaker in ""Magnolia"" which is no doubt purposeful. He is the successful brother the one who left home got married had kids and is now going trophy-fishing with Mark Cuban (""Cubes""). We meet Derek in his car on the way to his mothers house. He and his family are doing a regimented a cappella version of ""Sweet Child O Mine"" by Guns N Roses and he almost gets in a car accident yelling at his wife for her bad pitch. Its hard to explain but inspired. If only more of the film had featured his snarling face. Looking at Ferrell and Reillys mugs for an hour and a half straight can make one yearn for at the very least a flashback sequence. -- Advisory Much foul language an act of nudity on a drum set and a completely clothed sexual encounter.

Childish. Moronic. Simple. Juvenile. Silly. Just ridiculous. Man is it funny. It falls into that weird category of films that you cant really say is good in any particular way yet you would advise all your friends to see as soon as possible so that you might start repeating lines to each other over beers until youre laughing so hard you just throw up your arms and say ""What the heck lets see it again."" Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly star as Brennan and Dale two adults suffering from serious cases of arrested adolescence. Both still live at home Brennan with his mom Nancy (Mary Steenburgen) and Dale with his dad Robert (Richard Jenkins). Nancy and Robert meet at a convention where Robert a doctor is lecturing. Soon theyre married and Brennan and Nancy move in with Dale and Robert. One problem Because both are spoiled overgrown brats Brennan and Dale take an instant dislike to each other. A violent profane hilarious dislike. They whisper obscene threats to each other before falling asleep at night in the room theyre forced to share. (They also sleepwalk because well why not?) Nothing is too petty for them to fight over. Dale has a drum set he warns Brennan never to touch. You can imagine how long that lasts. What you might not imagine is Brennan threatening to place his scrotum on the drums. You certainly wouldnt imagine him following through on the threat. Visibly. You assume some sort of prosthetic is involved but man. Funny? Disgusting? Who are we kidding? Its both. This is probably a good time to point out that the wildly prolific Judd Apatow never one to back down from a little male nudity or serious foul language is on board as a producer. Why wouldnt he be because its a comedy made in the past two years? Step Brothers also re-teams Ferrell and Reilly with director Adam McKay whom they worked with on Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. And like most of the films these fellows collaborate on theres a nod toward a kind of sweetness. In this case Dale and Brennan bond over their mutual hatred of Brennans brother Derek (Adam Scott) a rich egotist bully of the first order whos so controlling he assigns various vocal parts to his wife and kids so that they can perform Sweet Child O Mine on car rides. His wife Alice (Kathryn Hahn) is repressed to the point that shes wildly attracted to Dale; her pursuit of him - just as profane as anything else here - is one of the funniest things about the movie. Then again watching Jenkins and Steenburgen usually upstanding types spit out F-bombs as if they moonlight as longshoremen is pretty great too. Eventually after a series of disasters Brennan and Dale are forced to grow up after a fashion. The last few scenes drag a bit as the two attempt to find their way in the adult world. But the ending eventually gets as crazy as everything else. ""You know how (messed) up this is"" someone asks Robert. Shes talking about a curious Christmas present but she could be talking about the movie as well. Certainly Step Brothers doesnt really have the structure of say a Superbad or Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Its more like a movie as imagined and realized by a 15-year-old boy who found a copy of Hustler in his garage. If this doesnt become Howard Sterns favorite movie the moment he sees it something has gone wrong with the universe. As for the rest of us well have to settle for thinking of Step Brothers as a movie thats gut-bustingly funny at times even if we would never admit it.
