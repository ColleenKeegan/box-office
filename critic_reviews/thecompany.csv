The world of dance is ever-shifting -- one jump landed ever-so-slightly wrong and a graceful star can become just another dancer on crutches wondering if her dream will ever be in reach again. Someones always standing behind ready to take over; nobody seems to miss the dancers who arent there. Altman whos been making movies for half a century seems to be looking at the dance world with the freshness of one experiencing the art for the first time. A master of intricate ensemble-driven dramas (""Nashville"" ""Gosford Park"") hes here gone in the other direction crafting a movie so free of plot it almost seems to be floating like those ballerinas in the arms of their partners. In Barbara Turners screenplay Ry (Neve Campbell) is a dancer in Chicagos acclaimed Joffrey Ballet. She takes classes she rehearses she performs she soaks in hot baths she waitresses part time at a local club she embarks on a sweetly understated romance with a young chef (James Franco). Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""The Company"" with Neve Campbell Malcolm McDowell James Franco Barbara Robertson the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago. Directed by Robert Altman from a screenplay by Barbara Turner based on a story by Campbell and Turner. 112 minutes. Rated PG-13 for brief strong language some nudity and sexual content. Harvard Exit. And thats about it -- no real conflict no melodrama just a slice of a young artists life seasoned by the constant awareness that everything could change in a heartbeat. Were seeing Ry on the cusp of her career; shes not yet a principal dancer nor an unknown in the background. Shes junior enough to need that second job senior enough to be carefully watched by those beneath her on the companys precisely defined ladder and to be singled out for a key role when another dancer is injured. What shines through ""The Company"" is a love of dance -- both from the elegantly calm Campbell (a classically trained dancer offscreen) and from the filmmakers who seem to respect the art of ballet too much to clutter it up with the kind of backstage drama in which ballet movies usually traffic. Instead of broken hearts and over-the-top divas (though Malcolm McDowell swans around nicely as the companys temperamental director who wears foofy scarves and is always shouting ""OK babies"") were given lovingly photographed dance sequences that show us the ease in a seemingly impossible art. The dancers stretch like cats in sunlight pointing their toes like beautiful contortionists. ""My Funny Valentine"" the melancholy Lar Lubovitch pas de deux that serves as the centerpiece of the film (with the choreographer playing himself in the rehearsal scenes) perfectly blends the art of dance and the art of film. Danced by Campbell and Domingo Rubio accompanied by onstage jazz musicians its set on an outdoor stage during an autumn storm; leaves blow against the couple as they writhe and twist to the music as if wanting to join the dance. Campbell her hair blowing against her pale face drapes herself weightlessly around Rubios body; its as if on that dark stage theyre the only two people in the world. Plenty of other tasty dance tidbits pepper ""The Company."" Theres Robert Desrosiers wildly over-the-top ""The Blue Snake""; Moses Pendleton and Cynthia Quinns wistful ""White Widow"" in which a lone ballerina spins on a swing; and the uncanny precision of Alwin Nikolais ""Tensile Involvement"" in which dancers trap themselves in weblike boxes spun from elastic bands. (Nikolais dance was choreographed 50 years ago -- around the time that Altman got started in movies -- but feels miraculous as ever perhaps because of the directors dazzled eye.) Plot? Who needs a plot? ""The Company"" is a loving tribute to artists and to art.

COMPANY16 Neve Campbell as Ry in the movie ""The Company."" Dance alone cant hold this Company together 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Company Drama. Directed by Robert Altman. Starring Neve Campbell Malcolm McDowell and James Franco. (PG-13. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The movie gods surely will forgive Robert Altman for the muddle hes made of ""The Company"" so I may as well be magnanimous too. Altman at his best -- in the brilliant ""McCabe amp; Mrs. Miller"" ""Nashville"" and ""Gosford Park"" -- adheres to some semblance of a script. When he gets into trouble as he did in ""Pret-a-Porter"" -- his inside look at the fashion industry and the movie that ""The Company"" to its detriment most closely resembles -- its for chucking much of the written word and following his own fancy. Even allowing that Altmans fancy is more interesting than what most Hollywood directors are up to ""The Company"" -- a behind-the-scenes study at a modern dance ensemble based on the Joffrey Ballet -- lacks what could kindly be called coherence. The scuttlebutt is that the movie began life with an actual story (written by Barbara Turner whose impressive credits include ""Georgia"") but that the grand old master diverged from it once he began filming. Altman couldnt take his eyes or lens off the Joffreys provocative dances performed by actual company members. Altman shot 10 ballets in part or full and they are a marvel to watch. Modern dance lovers will be ecstatic to see the Joffrey captured so vividly particularly because it rarely performs in the Bay Area since shifting its home base from New York to Chicago. Standout numbers are ""My Funny Valentine"" ""Light Rain"" and ""The Blue Snake"" (although the snakes motions reminded me a little too much of Peter Falk instructing Alan Arkin in how to do a ""serpentine"" in ""The In-Laws""). To make room for all this dance footage Altman allegedly left much of the story in the editing room. Neve Campbell ostensibly stars as Ry a fledgling dancer who catches the eye of the companys mercurial director Alberto Antonelli referred to as Mr. A with a combination of fear and affection. Malcolm McDowell plays this autocratic leader with frightening veracity. When Mr. A. calls his dancers ""babies"" theres an implication that like a ravenous witch in a fairy tale he might be considering chopping them into a stew. Campbell a former ballerina brought the idea for the movie to Altman. She wanted to show the dark underbelly of dancers seemingly glamorous jobs and that comes across in scenes of them working through neck spasms mangled feet backbiting thunderstorms and choreographers stormy temperaments. The veteran of the ""Scream"" trilogy may also have wanted audiences to know that her mouth isnt the only flexible part of her body. Campbell acquits herself alongside the younger and more practiced Joffrey dancers. But the role of Ry at least whats left of it doesnt allow Campbell much opportunity to display her acting chops. James Franco best known for his spot-on TV portrayal of James Dean is wasted as Josh a chef whom Ry spots working at a party. The two become sexually immersed without any visible sparks flying. ""The Company"" has no time for foreplay. On one morning after Josh is shown cracking eggs into a bowl but were deprived of seeing even the omelet hes whipping up for his lady love. Altman shot the film in Chicago but Sinatras kind of town is as wasted as this romantic interlude. If you look quickly youll spot a few of the citys icons such as Grant Park a fleeting view of a skyline and an equally fleeting glimpse of the interior of Louis Sullivans famed Auditorium Theater. Characters flit in and out like passengers in an airport waiting room and youre unsure whom you are meant to follow. One young man -- I never did catch his name -- begs for permission to crash at an apartment already overrun with itinerant dancers. He tells the overwrought landlady that he would have stayed at his aunts except that she just committed suicide. To the best of my knowledge these people never reappear in the movie. So why are they in it at all? On the other hand maybe its only appropriate in a dance film that so many elements are left up in the air. -- Advisory Brief nudity at the end.

"The Company is graceful but unmoving - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The Company is graceful but unmoving By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  January 16 2004 ""The Company"" Robert Altmans gossamer tension-free meditation on the ballet life never quite recovers from a performance scene that arrives about 20 minutes in. Set on an outdoor stage as evening storm clouds gather the dance is a pas de deux between Loretta ""Ry"" Ryan (Neve Campbell) and Domingo Rubio (a dancer more or less playing himself). As an eerie Kronos Quartet version of ""My Funny Valentine"" plays and the two pretty creatures entwine bend and fit into the spaces of each other the wind picks up alarmingly. Pages of the score fly across the stage the audience eyes the exits and then the heavens open and rain pours down. The dancers continuetrancelike the drops seeming to bounce off the bubble created by their art. Its a thrilling scene a duet between serenity and imminent disaster and it gives you goose bumps. The rest of the movie sad to say stays outside that bubble. Campbell a ballet dancer in childhood (we see her at age 6 or so in an old videotape Ry watches on TV) wrote the original ""story"" with ""screenwriter"" Barbara Turner and Im putting those words in quotes because Im awfully hard pressed to imagine what the two did. As ""The Company"" follows the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago across the course of a half year dipping into rehearsals apartments meeting rooms and stages we get to know a handful of characters. Theres Ry -- just another dancer in the company -- her sous-chef boyfriend Josh (James Franco) Alberto (Malcolm McDowell) the imperious director of the troupe and a receding chorus of dancers at the barre. The film is a lovely but anonymous tangle of limbs.Actually ""The Company"" may be the most extreme of Altmans ""milieu"" movies in which the director pulls his camera way back to capture the overheard conversations and comings and goings of a group. Even such misfires as ""Health"" (1980) and ""Pret-a-Porter"" (1994) indulged in story lines; ""Company"" offers up its dance performances like jewels on a missing string. Instead of plot we get vague situations -- such as Rys courtship of Josh or the increasingly desperate hissy-fits of an aging prima donna (dancer Deborah Dawn) -- and more versions of ""My Funny Valentine"" than you ever knew existed. The result feels like a documentary thats missing the surprises of real life.Still balletomanes may want to nudge that rating up a star or two and if the ""purity"" of Altmans approach has its (massive) pretensions it can lull you into a happy stupor. Sometimes all it takes is a sequence of a male dancer rehearsing at night while across the city Ry draws a bath a Bach cello sonata uniting them in intimacy. The performances are sinuous and clever -- except for the climactic ""Blue Snake"" number a triumph of Bad Conceptual Art -- and the sense we get of the dancers life is one of privileged poverty with eight kids to a tiny flat and a total commitment to art.""The Company"" shows how unforgiving that art can be in a scene in which a dancer (Suzanne L. Prisco) snaps her Achilles tendon during rehearsal and everyone backs away from the sudden wreckage of a career. Its the only moment in which real pain intrudes on the movies pastel little world. McDowells rages are amusing but harmless and Campbell floats through as if reliving the dreams of her childhood. To answer a question that many are asking the actress is quite believable as a dancer. Its as a character that shes not really there.(""The Company"" 1/2) Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

More than gymnasts basketball wizards or porn stars (a comparison more apt than it sounds given that every dimple and contortion of their flesh is on display) dancers dont just occupy their bodies completely. They are occupied by them and thus they appear to leap the limits of consciousness; they turn sensuality into a human sculpture of grace. The beauty and also the wry prank of Robert Altmans The Company is that by deliberately underplaying even throwing away anything that would smack of drama the movie captures and exults in the enigmatic drama of a dancers existence the life of the body transformed into art then back into life again. The movie is fiction that feels like a Zen documentary and its unique in the Altman canon. Watching it I felt by turns engrossed detached dazzled bored curious enlightened and moved. Early on Neve Campbell as Ry (short for Ryan) a promising member of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago steps into a rehearsal to replace a willowy swanlike dancer who can no longer conceal her neck spasms. Its an ""All About Eve"" situation with the gifted young performer taking over for an established star. Yet if you blink a few scenes later youll miss the injured dancers head toss of dismay as she realizes that shell have to sit the performance out. The Sturm und Drang starts and ends there. The concert itself is held at night on a stage in the middle of Chicagos Grant Park and the moment before Ry comes out to perform theres a rumble of thunder. The clouds erupt rain pours onto the audience and the Japanese lanterns that have been strung along the aisles bob madly in the Chicago wind. Ah we think the irony - Rys big moment capsized by a storm. Except that the dance an amorous tangle choreographed to ""My Funny Valentine"" goes off without a hitch and becomes even more memorable due to the backdrop of tumultuous weather. This ""The Company"" says is the odyssey of a dancer with each setback and opportunity flowing into the next. Altman makes one concession to showbiz and its a delectable one. As Mr. Antonelli the artistic director of the company Malcolm McDowell is theatrical and flamboyant so that his ""babies"" (i.e. the dancers) dont have to be. In his scarves and bristle coif of white hair ""Mr. A"" is a politician posing as an aesthete. Virtually everything that comes out of his mouth is flattery (he uses the word ""Fantastic"" as if it were a form of massage) but the key to reading him is to separate the fake compliments from the genuine. Hes an elegant tribute to the days when highbrows had fire in their bellies. McDowell is a pleasure to watch but the key to ""The Company"" is the quiet focused rapture of Neve Campbell who formally trained in ballet and performed all of her on-screen dances. The tranquil delight she takes in her body becomes its own eloquent form of acting. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

By Bollywood standards a dark and realistic look at the Mumbai underworld through the battle between a powerful don and his vengeful former sidekick ""Company"" manages to cater to Hindi cinema norms while feeding the viewer something a little different. Powered by a quietly crazed performance from Ajay Devgan and complemented by a strong debut from young actor Vivek Oberoi (whos since gone on to star in ""Road"" and ""Saathiya"") pic drew plaudits from Indian critics on release last April and certainly ranks as one of Bollywoods best of 2002. Further fest slots plus sales to specialized webs should spread the ""Company"" word. Movies theme (outlined in the punchy news-style prologue) is that the underworld is run along corporate lines like any other business; the only difference is that once in you cant leave. Journeyman helmer Ram Gopal Varma previously dealt with such denizens in 1998 Hindi hit ""Satya"" but here hes more interested in the rules and philosophy of societys dark side than pure action. Though hardly new to world cinema ""Company"" is a first for Bollywood in its scope and ambition. Recruited by Malik (Devgan) a senior member of the Aslam Ali gang eager-to-please Chandu (Oberoi) soon wins the older mans trust as the mob expands its operations in Mumbai. When Chandu saves Maliks life from a gunman on the set of a film the gang has an interest in - pic is up-front about mob connections with the movie industry as well as with politicos - the bond between the two is sealed to the growing dislike of Maliks longtime sidekick Yadav (Ganesh Yadav). Hoping to get some dirt on Malik that will build a case against him a cop Srinivasan (Mohanlal) tries to beat a confession out of the arrested gunman; however Malik has already taken his revenge by killing the gunmans family. Tipped off by a police mole that Srinivasan is hot on his tail Malik scoots off to Hong Kong along with his moll Saroja (Manisha Koirala) Chandu and Chandus wife Kannu (Antara Mali). Running his operation from H.K. Malik quickly becomes a powerful figure with legal entities as well as his protection biz. However when Chandu expedites a contract from an Indian politician to kill a rival but demurs -- against Maliks express wishes -- from killing the victims children as well the two fall out. After a bumpy start with some rough pacing and a couple of over-edited nightclub numbers by singers Urmila Matondkar and Isha Koppikar pic grows during its first part into a convincingly claustrophobic portrait of mob life maintaining the mood even after its shift to Hong Kong. Intermission arrives at a pregnant point in the drama as Chandu tipped off by Saroja that Malik is now after him phones from the airport to tell him that his days as a crime lord are over. Opening with a panorama of Mumbai overlaid with a crescendo of ringing cell phones as Malik desperately tries to find out where Chandu is hiding Part Two plays like one long climax driven by Sandeep Chowtas dark relentless score. Notably there are also no musical interludes; in fact Varma originally intended the whole picture to be song-free. When Malik finally traces Chandu to his hideout in Nairobi Kenya and sends in a hit squad Chandu (in a gritty rooftop chase) narrowly escapes with his life. Both sides from their separate bases overseas then trigger an escalating gang war in Mumbai with complex and bloody consequences. Devgan unquestionably steals the show as the calmly psychotic Malik all dead beady eyes and a code of conduct that admits no exceptions. Unsmiling and with mop hair and designer stubble Oberoi makes a strong impression as the young company man who turns against him - not because he sees the light between good and bad but simply to teach his onetime boss a lesson in kind. In retrospect Oberois perf is even more striking given his fresh-faced romantic lead in ""Saathiya"" opposite Rani Mukherjee. Strong raft of supports is led by Koirala - a Bollywood actress who can really act - as Maliks tough moll and Keralan star Mohanlal as the cop who just wont give up. Mali is fine as Chandus wife and veteran Seema Biswas brings some needed compassion to the role of Chandus mom. Technically film is fine with a slightly rough edge which fits the subject. As well as locations in Hong Kong and Kenya some scenes were also lensed in Switzerland. CompanyIndia ProductionA Varma Corp. production. (International sales Eros Multimedia London.)
