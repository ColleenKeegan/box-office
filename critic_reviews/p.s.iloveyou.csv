Theres little to love in Swanks new film Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Whats a two-time Oscar winner to do? Get a new agent perhaps. This has not been a good year for Hilary Swank. In the spring she starred in the silly horror movie The Reaping. Earlier this year she had the lead role in the forgettable Freedom Writers. Now shes made another blunder by taking the main part in the trite wannabe tearjerker P.S. I Love You. Perhaps she wanted to try out lighter fare than the films for which she received accolades (Million Dollar Baby Boys Dont Cry). But some actors are better suited to straight-ahead dramas. Swank appears to be one of them. P.S. I Love You has occasional bursts of watered-down charm mostly when Gerard Butler is on screen as Swanks Irish swain. But hes not around enough because the forced conceit based on the novel by Cecelia Ahern has him dying at 35 of a brain tumor. But madly in love with his wife he finds a way to communicate with her even after his untimely demise. No this is not Ghost redux. He writes letters that get mysteriously mailed entreating her to belt out songs at a karaoke bar take up fishing or go dancing in a gay bar to liven up her grieving spirit. Unfortunately we have to sit through these forced efforts at frivolity usually in the company of her irritating best gal pals (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon). Co-written and directed by Richard LaGravese the film cant seem to decide whether it wants to be a serious exploration of mourning or a light and fluffy love story. It tries to be both and doesnt do either very well. The dialogue is uninspired and the revelations cliched. The activities that her dead husband sets up dont ring true. For one they were short on money; his suggestions are pricey. Somehow he orchestrates and funds an elaborate trip to Ireland for Swank and her friends. There she meets his buddy (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and sparks fly in a pair of far-fetched incidents. This misguided chick flick jumps through a lot of hoops just to state the obvious ""Life goes on enjoy the time you have.""

I Love You is a load of sentimental humbug that sees Hilary Swank winner of Academy Awards for Boys Dont Cry and Million Dollar Baby fighting way below her weight in the part of Holly a young widow whose dead husband has pre-arranged for her life without him.By Susan WalkerEntertainment reporterFri. Dec. 21 2007 (out of 4)Starring Hilary Swank Gerard Butler and Kathy Bates. Written by Richard LaGravenese and Steven Rogers. Directed by Richard LaGravenese. 126 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Article Continued Below`Tis the season to be maudlin.P.S. I Love You is a load of sentimental humbug that sees Hilary Swank winner of Academy Awards for Boys Dont Cry and Million Dollar Baby fighting way below her weight in the part of Holly a young widow whose dead husband has pre-arranged for her life without him. Gerard Butler hasnt fared so well either going from playing Beowulf (in Beowulf amp; Grendel) to Gerry Kennedy a 30-something Irishman who falls in love with an American tourist marries her moves to New York City to drive limos and then promptly dies of a brain tumour.Butler who looks somewhat like Russell Crowe with an Irish accent gets a lot of screen time for a dead guy as flashbacks return Holly to the best and the worst scenes of life with Gerry.He has a great singing voice; she doesnt. He challenges her to sing at a karaoke night; she trips on a cord and smashes her face. They quarrel bitterly over money and Holly nags him relentlessly about her unfulfilled life.""Married people make each other feel like s--- all the time"" one of her friends tells her in one of the movies mildly funny bits of dialogue. On Hollys 30th birthday the first of a series of messages from now-dead Gerry arrives a tape recording advising her to dress up and go out to celebrate. Holly has been cooped up in their apartment surrounded by dirty dishes and dirty clothes watching old movies and wishing she was Bette Davis. The inconsolable wife is not abandoned to her grief.Her mother Patricia (Kathy Bates) and her two friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) do their best to cheer her up. And Gerrys messages keep mysteriously arriving with imperatives for Holly.One envelope leads to a travel agent and tickets for her and her friends to go to Ireland and visit Gerrys former home. Sharon and Gina quite reasonably think that the letters may not be helping Holly get over her loss.In fact Gerry might be the most possessive posthumous husband who ever died. A scary prospect emerges in the form of Daniel the lonely socially awkward bartender who moves in on Holly with thoughts of being more than a friend. Harry Connick Jr. does a very good job of being every girls idea of the date from hell. Based on the bestselling 2004 novel of the same name by Irish writer Cecelia Ahern P.S. I Love You is a march of cliches from Denises ruthless methods for nabbing a husband to Hollys resentment of her mothers advice to get over herself to the charms of the rural Irish.Its the sort of movie that no man will ever go to unless dragged by a woman. His sole reward will be the sight of Swank in sexy underwear.And as if anticipating the female audiences for this interminable sappy chick flick director Richard LaGravenese is liberal with the beefcake shots. P.S. I Love You is a married womans awful nightmare. Your husband dies and directs your life as a really bad movie.

Starring Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler. Directed by Richard LaGravenese. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres a moment late in ""P.S. I Love You"" when Hilary Swank has a belated emotional meltdown in front of her mom and theres a look on Kathy Bates face approaching pure horror. If someone attached a thought bubble over Bates head it might read ""Did you really win two Oscars?"" This is a movie that will leave you stunned and stupefied from beginning to end if you dont head for the exits first. The only good things in it are Lisa Kudrow and Swanks wardrobe. The plot is unbelievable although a competent script could have fixed that. The direction is flabby and uninspired the casting is wrongheaded and the performances run the gamut from uninteresting to insufferable. Based on a novel I never want to read by Cecelia Ahern the film is about real estate broker Holly Kennedy (Swank) who buys designer clothes on eBay and is married to Gerry a lusty Irish guy (Gerard Butler). As the film begins they are returning to their cramped New York apartment after visiting her mother and have a battle that sounds like Beckett with belly laughs except Vladimir and Estragon actually make a more interesting couple than Gerry and Holly. The fight is so forced and works so hard to twist sentences and words around that youre thinking ""Um human beings dont talk like this and why am I sitting in a movie theater watching and listening to people I wouldnt want to spend two minutes with?"" Five minutes later (but whos counting?) youre almost relieved to find out hes dead from a brain tumor although truth to tell hes the less obnoxious half of these ""battling Bickersons."" The rest of the movie turns on the notion that as he was shimmying off this mortal coil Gerry wrote Holly a number of letters and conspired with everyone he knew to have them delivered to her at various points to help her get over him being dead and all and get on with her life. You also need to know - well ""need"" is such a strong word for such a pointless film - that Harry Connick Jr. looking a bit jowly like an elephant seal in need of a shave plays a bartender who wants to be more than a pal to Holly. Holly goes off to Ireland with her two best friends one of whom thank God is Kudrow the only bright spot in this dismal mess. Butler Bates Gina Gershon and James Marsters arent really awful; its just that the script by director Richard LaGravenese and Steven Rogers is so incompetent Dame Judi Dench couldnt make the dialogue believable. Swank however is awful. If anything she actually makes the bad script worse. Its easy to see why some lamebrain thought it would be a good idea to cast her in this role. Its why she was cast in ""Freedom Writers."" After playing a teenage transsexual and a female pugilist how about finding something that might soften and expand her image? Trouble is she cant do it. Shes not in this case at least a Katharine Hepburn who managed a delicate balance of steely resolve and kittenish vulnerability in some of her better film choices. Of course the film wants terribly to be ""Ghost"" without a potters wheel but it just succeeds at being terrible. Although ""Ghost"" would never be anyones idea of a great film it got to you. Sure it was manipulative but it went for real emotions and somehow you found it easier to believe that Patrick Swayze was really doing the whole Casper the Friendly Ghost bit around Demi Moore than virtually any part of ""P.S. I Love You."" P.S. It stinks. -- Advisory Some crude language and sexual references.

Not a ghost of a chanceBy Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted December 21 2007 Hilary Swank owns two best-actress Oscars - for the transgender tragedy Boys Dont Cry and for Clint Eastwoods distaff boxing pic Million Dollar Baby - and in my mind she deserves them both. But put her in a frilly dress set her loose in a chick flick and something goes terribly wrong. And in the grief-drenched romantic comedy P.S. I Love You things are excruciatingly amiss start to finish. In the morose mopey vein of Ghost and Truly Madly Deeply but with none of the charm and less of the magic P.S. I Love You is about a tightly wound New Yorker - Swanks Holly Kennedy - whose glinty-eyed Irishman husband dies just after the opening credits. (Brain tumor but weve seen enough of the grinning Gerard Butler and his beefy biceps in the opening scene to last a lifetime. And then we see him again and again in flashbacks and apparitions.) But heres the gimmick Before Gerry shuffles off this mortal coil he pens a series of letters to Holly advising her how to overcome her loss and get on with life. Call it Dead Man Writing. The first epistle arrives on Hollys 30th birthday along with a tape recording. In the weeks months and seasonal equinoxes to follow more communiques find their way to Holly Gerry urges her to get out and party to date to travel to Ireland with her gal pals (Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow). The latter jaunt is particularly tough on Holly because it was there on a road in County Wicklow that she and Gerry first met and fell in love. Gerrys parents still live there and his old bandmate - a hunky fellow with his own leprechauny gleam - shows up too. Adapted from Cecelia Aherns novel and directed by Richard LaGravenese - who steered Swank through the vastly more tolerable inspirational teacher flick Freedom Writers - P.S. I Love You is a strangely cast haltingly paced affair. Kathy Bates is Hollys glum bar-owner mom singer/songwriter Nellie McKay makes her screen debut (with a Doris Day coif) as Hollys chirpy younger sister and Gershon and Kudrow do their respective shticks (lippy ditzy) as the girlfriends. Harry Connick Jr. acquits himself best of the lot as a sad-sack bartender who befriends Holly - and wants to be more than friends. His characters own sorry state of affairs is the source of the movies few genuinely funny lines. LaGravenese clearly worships his leading lady and he has said in interviews that he wanted to give Swank a more feminine Audrey Hepburnesque role. But one look at the scene in which the shut-in grieving Holly - wearing her dead hubbys boxers and suspenders - sings along to Judy Garlands ""The Man That Got Away"" from A Star Is Born . . . well theres nothing Audrey Hepburn-esque about it. Its scarily bad. P.S. I Love You  (out of four stars) Directed by Richard LaGravenese. With Hilary Swank Gerard Butler Kathy Bates Harry Connick Jr. Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow.

A protracted piece of schmaltz ""P.S. I Love You"" looks like a hand-me-down from Sandra Bullock and Drew Barrymore. Swank follows up ""The Reaping"" by being uncomfortably cast as an unhappy real-estate agent who shares a too-small Mulberry Street apartment with her Irish husband played with a wavering accent by Scottish hunk Gerard Butler (""300""). By the second scene hes dead of a brain tumor although he keeps reappearing in flashbacks and in the form of corny grief-therapy letters hes left behind for her. Either way he has no more chemistry with Swank when dead than he did when he was alive. This is the sort of clueless rom-com in which Harry Connick Jr. as Butlers aspiring replacement doesnt sing while Swank delivers two ear-splitting numbers. There are also clips from no fewer than four Bette Davis movies. These serve only to remind us how the great ""womens movies"" have devolved into trite ""chick flicks"" like this one. The other female characters are stereotypes the widows pals - a too-choosy spinster (Lisa Kudrow) and a pregnant earth mother (Gina Gershon) - and the widows mother an embittered divorcee played by Kathy Bates. Director Richard LaGravenese (""Freedom Writers"") has more cliches in store when the two-hour-plus running time takes us to Ireland where the late husband has arranged for his widow to meet another Irish musician (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Ladies love means never having to force your significant other to sit through something as sloppy as ""P.S. I Love You."" P.S. I LOVE YOUTen-ton blarney.Running time 126 minutes. Rated PG- 13 (sexual references nudity). At the E-Walk the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay others.

I Love You is a loss cause BY Jack Mathews Thursday December 20 2007 907 PM facebook Tweet email Her hubbys death sends Hilary Swank (with Lisa Kudrow l. and Gina Gershon r.) on an adventure. BY Jack Mathews Thursday December 20 2007 907 PM P.S. I Love You. Romantic comedy about a young widow being helped through grief by her dead husband. With Hilary Swank Gerard Butler. Director Richard LaGravenese (206). PG-13 Sexual references brief nudity. At area theaters.Its hard to imagine a crueler way for a dying man to assure his widows lingering grief than to plan out her post-funeral year with periodically delivered love letters telling her how to get over him. Its harder yet to imagine a crueler way for a living person to spend two hours than watching Richard LaGraveneses ""P.S. I Love You"" the movie burdened with that premise. Cecelia Ahern the young author of the novel being adapted obviously didnt think of her premise as cruel. Hers is an adolescent fantasy of undying love and I imagine most of her readers were still dreaming of Prince Charming. The movie - with some gamy sexual references a one-night stand and a long look at a stud muffins naked buns - targets an older female audience. They may see it as unbearably cute filled with ridiculous coincidences and laced with performances that - like the obnoxious soundtrack music - overstate the mood. The story follows Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) and her two best friends (Lisa Kudrow Gina Gershon) as they race around Manhattan following her late Irish husband Gerrys detailed instructions left on mysteriously delivered letters that always end with ""P.S. I love you."" His most ambitious note sends her and her friends to Ireland where she is to meet with his parents collect yet another note and visit the backyard fort where he played as a child. Each of the acted-out directions comes with a flashback to Holly and Gerrys life together which was mostly one of petty arguments followed by hot sex. As thoroughly as Gerrys ghost dominates Holly she does get a little action of her own falling into bed with William a handsome Irish handyman (Jeffrey Dean Morgan owner of the aforementioned buns) who turns out to have been Gerrys best friend in childhood. ""Dont worry about it"" he says ""we shared everything."" The films eager question is when Holly is finally free of Gerrys grasp will she take up with William he of the fixed grin or Daniel (Harry Connick Jr.) a sulking bartender who fell in love with her at Gerrys memorial?

Pictures / MCT ""P.S. I Love You"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Chick flick ick. Who should be more insulted by ""P.S. I Love You"" Women who are portrayed as shrill materialistic harpies who fall down regularly? Or men who are shown to be at their most romantically attractive when theyre dead? Guys and gals lets put aside our differences for once join hands and hate this movie. Gerard Butler and Hilary Swank star as Gerry and Holly a Manhattan couple with nothing in common beyond their ferociously toned bodies. When they grapple in a pre-credits lovemaking scene it looks like a Greco-Roman grope censored from ""300."" Shes a shrill shoe fetishist who wants a bigger apartment a better job babies and everything else on an ambitious 29-year-olds to-do list and wants them right now. Gerrys a happy-go-lucky Irishman who is willing to take a hurled Jimmy Choo to the face if it will get Holly off the warpath. Before you can say ""wake"" were at Gerrys while Holly descends into a period of mourning marked by comic drunkenness and bad hair. Her mom (Kathy Bates) her best friend (Lisa Kudrow) and a friendly bartender (Harry Connick Jr.) try to rouse her from her funk. But nothing works until Holly begins receiving posthumous letters from Gerry instructing her to go on a prearranged series of life-affirming adventures each note signed ""P.S. I love you."" If that didnt trigger your gag reflex you might survive the manufactured romantic zaniness that ensues. With the love letters of Lazarus charting her path Holly sings karaoke (and falls down). She heads to Ireland where Gerry substitutes are thicker than the foam on a pint of Guinness (and falls down). She revisits Gerry in memories and fantasies and grows impatient when her friends move ahead with their lives as she waits for another message from a dead man. Swank displays her remarkable teeth and the story clatters to a manipulative ""feel good"" ending. The sensation of having their sympathies bludgeoned with a sledgehammer will send many viewers away feeling anything but. P.S. I LOVE YOU  out of 4 stars The setup Dead guy (Gerard Butler) sends messages from beyond the grave commanding his widow (Hilary Swank) to go out sing karaoke and have fun. What works If youre hankering for formula romance with every ounce of humanity cold-pressed out of it youre in luck. What doesnt Swanks shtick is grim determination not romantic comedy. Rating PG-13 for sexual references and brief nudity. Great scene Fans of Butlers abs in ""300"" will be pleased to know that he performs a striptease.

I Love You 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Whats on your holiday wishlist? Is there room for a maudlin romantic comedy that brandishes its earnestness like tacky light displays synchronized to Trans-Siberian Orchestra? If so it looks like the holidays have come a few days early. Based on the book by Cecelia Ahern P.S. I Love You sets out to tell a love story for the ages cut tragically short; but its characters never quite get comfortable enough to give it the heart it needs. Its a soft film with hard talent that just doesnt add up to proper postage. Were first introduced to Holly (Hilary Swank) and Gerry (Gerard Butler) in the midst of a lovers quarrel. She of the overbearing shoe-loving fairer sex and he of the oft-shirtless endearingly-directionless Irish dreamboat variety are having a spat about their future. Shes worried about money apartments and stability while all he cares about is having a baby and being with her. Its a fight about everything and nothing all at once and its just too relentlessly relatable. Butler takes his King Leonidas intensity down about 299 notches and plays Gerry with a rugged sweetness. Unfortunately before the opening credits finish rolling Gerry suffers a brain tumor and is relegated to voiceover and flashbacks. Hes gone but not forgotten as he lives on through a series of letters sent to Holly to guide her on a journey to find herself again. Like her character Swank could use the counsel. She tries everything to temper her Million Dollar Baby toughness - including lots of midriff baring and being physically carried by virtually every male in the film - but never seems to fit her square dramatic chops into the round rom-com hole. The rest of the cast is equally as unsure where they stand. Kathy Bates as Hollys mother plays it hot-and-cold and rarely finds a comfortable middle ground. As a bachelor with a heart of gold but no social graces Harry Connick Jr. is a strain and he muddles up each scene hes in with such heavy-handed awkwardness you dont laugh with him or at him - you just dont laugh at all. Hollys best girlfriends fare slightly better. Sharon (Gina Gershon) is unoffensive if not completely superfluous while Lisa Kudrow plays Denise with a Phoebe Bouffet-esque airiness that suits the fluffy material. In truth Kudrow is the only one who seems to realize what movie shes in. P.S. I Love You could be another light holiday romp in the vein of last years Cameron Diaz/Kate Winslet life-swap The Holiday. Despite its slightly morbid concept the story delivers on a trite but heart-warming tale of love loss and life. Couple that with a stunning array of Irish countryside landscapes and P.S. I Love You could be completely satisfying if you keep your expectations low. Its the serious treatment forced upon this feel-good flick that highlights its weaknesses.

"P.S. this film is silly and blithely inept - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGames THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review P.S. this film is silly and blithely inept Gerry (Gerard Butler) dies but leaves behind letters to raise the spirits of his wife Holly (Hilary Swank). (Norman jean roy/warner bros. via ap) Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / December 21 2007 Could there be a more selfless star than Hilary Swank? Having ascended to fame like an angel playing women who die shes generously decided in ""P.S. I Love You"" to give someone else a chance. This time its Gerard Butler - wait a minute didnt he just lead the Spartan army to its death in ""300""? Well now hes Gerry a hunky happy-go-lucky musical Irishman (do the movies know any other kind?); and after 20 minutes hes dead. But the letters hes left behind are intended to keep his girlish wife Holly (Swank) from becoming ""the Ms. Havisham of the Lower East Side.""The notes are full of high-calorie personality. ""Come on Disco Diva"" begins one. (Did Gerry have a secret career doing deep-house dance remixes?) They predict where Holly will be standing when she reads them and how shell react to this or that sentence. These letters and the flashbacks they produce take away her autonomy while demanding she get a life. If Gerry says do karaoke (he actually does) she more or less asks ""How high?"" He wants her to throw out his clothes and go to Ireland where sadly no one calls Swank ""mo cuishle.""This movie doesnt have enough fresh air to play on Oxygen. Its agenda might be epistolary but its brain is covered in Post-its. The director is Richard LaGravenese the otherwise bright man whos adapted Cecelia Aherns novel with Steven Rogers. LaGravenese has an interesting body of work. The screenplay for ""The Fisher King"" and the mostly funny one for ""The Ref"" were his. And hes spun dross into Hollywood gold (""The Bridges of Madison County"") and turned gold into dross (hes one of the names credited for ""Beloved""). His first movie as a director 1998s ""Living Out Loud"" with Holly Hunter Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah had some grace amid the talky awkwardness.""P.S. I Love You"" is blithely inept. The movie wants to be thoughtful and cute and self-helping behold as the letters help Holly discover her vocation But boy is it a chore to look at and LaGravenese doesnt string together enough decent scenes for any kind of entertainment to take hold. For one thing his camera doesnt always know what to look at. Sometimes it doesnt know when to look away. Every time Swank and Butler kiss you feel the earth move. But thats only because youre watching two tectonic plates press hard against each other. An episode of ""Men in Trees"" has more to recommend it. And ""P.S. I Love You"" is a comedy with Harry Connick Jr. as a cracked suitor of Hollys Kathy Bates as her mother and Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow as her best friends. Except for the musician Nellie McKay who plays Gerrys cool-ditz sister theyre all fine especially Kudrow who tries a little of everything with the dialogue - boldface italics underline. But what theyre doing is ultimately so banal it hurts. The long scenes suggest writers at work (""P.P.S I Love You""?). Their monotony suggests they didnt work very hard. The would-be-slapstick sight of Swank Gershon and Kudrow falling all over a fishing boat is enough to make you pray a dorsal fin comes floating by.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

What kind of movie do you feel like? Ask Movie Mom Click here Trailer Ace the Case with Susan Sarandon Posted by Nell Minow 10-year old Olivia and her 17-year old brother are left home alone when their Mom goes on a business trip for the weekend. Olivia sees a young woman being kidnapped on the empty New York City streets. Her brother doesnt believe her and neither do the cops. So Olivia starts investigating on her own trying to persuade a cynical detective (Susan Sarandon) that she is telling the truth.

If we dont know where we are there may be jokes but it is not truly comedy. Writer/directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are not people with a lot of ideas. Their ""21 and Over"" was pretty much the same movie as their ""Hangover."" And the big innovation here is that this time its girls-gone-wild instead of boys. But it plays like it was inspired by a couple of womens magazine articles about the impossibility of ""having it all."" The movie says it comes down on the side of not judging other mothers those who seem to be losing it and those who seem to be holding it together. The message is that its good to forgive yourself for not being able to be perfect all the time. And its important to understand that loving your children means letting them learn to be responsible and not doing everything for them. But those good thoughts are undercut by the unexpectedly sour triumph of the main characters with antagonists who must be shown as spineless or pitiful. The reality of womens lives is a target-rich environment for comedy and the reality of mothers lives is especially so. But this script is so lazy that it does not meet the level of basic cable sitcoms for originality and wit. They have more in 22 minutes than ""Bad Moms"" does in 101. This is a movie that is supposed to be about female empowerment. There are two specific instances that involve women telling their cartoonishly awful husbands that they need to take more responsibility for their children and their households. And yet this is a movie that consistently shows the PTA as apparently entirely made up of women with the exception of one man who is shown at a PTA meeting specifically so he can be humiliated in public by his wife. Funny. amiright? And this is a school that apparently includes elementary middle and possibly high school students does not notice when a mother does a childs homework and has a pot-smoking principal who cant stand up to the President of the PTA. What? ""Hangover"" worked because most of the movie was about dealing with the horrible consequences of a major sort-of-accidental bender. ""Bad Moms"" tries to persuade us that a bender and attendant irresponsible behavior are signs of liberation. The bender is a mild one no tigers or tooth extractions. On the other hand the issue of money is raised but in the kind of fairy tale way that suggests no one connected with the movie has had to think about how to pay for groceries -- or damage inflicted on a grocery store -- in a very long time. Were supposed to believe them when they talk about how much they love their kids and would do anything for them but they dont really seem to enjoy or support them. And newsflash -- jokes about foreskins butt stuff and girl-on-girl kisses as a sign of rebellion and edginess are so 1998. The one-dimensional characters are as follows Mila Kunis plays Amy the exhausted mom of two who boots out her childish cheating husband. Shes had no sex in years. Kristen Bell is Kiki the exhausted mom of four whose husband treats her like Cinderella. They have sex once a week (""After ""Blue Bloods"") but he is not very uh excited or exciting. And Kathryn Hahn is Carla the happy unreliable slut who does not even know what a standardized test is much less whether her son has to take and pass them. She talks about sex all the time but does not seem to be having any either. Christina Applegate is Gwendolyn the Mean Girl (with henchmen played by Jada Pinkett-Smith and ""Bridesmaids"" co-writer Annie Mumolo (who should have done a major rewrite here). One thing Lucas and Moore get right is the combination of the humblebrag and the insult-wrapped in a compliment handed out by the ladies who run the school. Yes when they flutter their eyelashes and say ""I dont know how you do it"" to Amy she understands that they mean ""Youre doing it badly."" And there is a lot to be said about impossible standards and judgey people especially when it comes to parenting. But that requires actually saying something not just pointing it out. Amy blows her top decides not to try to be everything to everyone any more and then when Gwendolyn lashes back involving Amys daughter (in the Bizarro world of this movie the head of the PTA is in charge of everything in the school) Amy decides to run against her on a platform similar to but less authentic than that of Tammy in ""Election."" Even in a PTA election someone has to propose something more than ""lets do less and not judge each other."" All four women are brilliant actors and comedians and make as much of this material as they can but they all deserve much better. Jay Hernandez transcends the thankless role of the hot guy making him the only male in the film who is not completely infantilized. Someone needs to put him in a leading man role. And someone needs to start putting women in the leading role of writing and directing stories about women or at least men who can do better than this. NOTE The highlight of the movie is the series of conversations over the credits with the actresses and their real-life mothers filled with exactly the wit and heart missing from most of the film. Parents should know that this film is crude and explicit language throughout including very strong and crude language drinking drugs sexual references and explicit nudity and comic peril and violence. Family discussion Who is responsible for the standard the moms felt they had to live up to? How would this be different if it was about dads?

During the boring parts of this movie I played a game I made up that I called ""Same or Different."" For example in one of the earlier Bourne movies our hero the once-amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) grabbed a limited-use anonymous cell phone for a particularly clever maneuver. In this one he grabs a small tracking device handily left out in a bowl like peanuts at a bar for happy hour. Same or different? Different because the first one was plausible and this one was ridiculous. The earlier films had exceptionally well-staged fight scenes that felt like real people who get out of breath and hurt each other and jockey for advantage. In the first moments of this film in addition to completely unnecessary jumps between five different locations around the world for no purpose he knocks out an enormous professional fighter with one punch. Same or different? Same answer as above.  And if we distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys by how much collateral damage they inflict on the world -- how many innocent bystanders get killed the answer here is more same than different. There are franchise films made for fan service and then there are those that do not even service the fans are merely a cash grab and retroactively devalue the franchise. This is a movie that asks us to believe that the head of the CIA and a Mark Zuckerberg-young titan of the worlds coolest social media company a sort of cross between Google and Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat decide to have a conversation of the utmost secrecy in a posh Washington DC restaurant the kind where everyone eavesdrops on the big shots at the next table especially reporters politicians and Hill staffers. The first three Bourne films transcended the action/spy genre with a gritty almost intimate feel far from the glossiness of James Bond and with an expanding deepening storyline that as the then-LA Times critic Manohla Dargis said began with the existential in ""Identity"" (Who am I?) extended to the moral in ""Supremacy"" (What did I do?). With the third film the question of culpability extended to the larger ""I"" of the government Who are we and what have we done? We will put aside for the moment the non-Bourne ""Bourne"" which mistakenly went in the direction of a secret government program that was more ""Captain America"" than Bourne with a mysterious ability-enhancing drug that removed the somber reality that resonated with the era of waterboarding and Abu Ghraib. There is plenty to explore and attempt to expiate now and the movie tries to touch on contemporary issues explored in far more compelling -- and terrifying -- terms in documentaries like Alex Gibneys ""We Steal Secrets"" and ""Zero Days."" It just doesnt do anything interesting with them while it is piling improbable motivations and preposterous situations almost as high as the carnage and wrecked cars. Parents should know that this film has constant spy-related action-style peril and violence many characters injured and killed including many innocent bystanders themes of government corruption and some strong language. Family discussion Who should decide the balance between privacy and security and how much information about those decisions should be public? What real-life events inspired this story?

I Love You by Bill Goodykoontz - Dec. 21 2007 1200 AM The Arizona Republic Images from ""P.S. I Love You"" and other new movies What do you get when you stick a talented interesting cast in an uninspiring chick flick? Short answer P.S. I Love You. Longer answer You get Hillary Swank Gerard Butler Gina Gershon Kathy Bates Harry Connick Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in an overlong melodrama built from the ground up to produce just-below-the-surface tears not tap into real emotion. On the plus side you also get Lisa Kudrow. Combined with her underrated work in HBOs The Comeback Kudrow is proving to have the most satisfying career of any of the former Friends. Shes hilarious as a man-hungry friend of Swank the funniest - and best - thing about the movie. Swank plays Holly Kennedy whos married to Gerry (Butler). Were meant to think of them as having one of those storybook romances that nothing not even death can conquer. Gerrys death from a brain tumor a few minutes into the film drives the point home in case you missed it. We havent heard the last from Gerry you see. Over the course of her first year as a widow Holly receives letters that Gerry wrote before his death instructing her on how to get over him. Soon shes out on the town with her pals singing karaoke visiting Ireland (Gerry was Irish) where she finds temporary comfort in the arms of Gerrys best friend (Morgan working an Irish accent) throwing out Gerrys clothes whatever. We also havent seen the last of Gerry; he shows up in flashbacks all the time often arguing with Holly. They argue ""cute"" of course but still. If youre wondering how Holly is supposed to move on with her life if shes getting instructions on how to live it every so often from her dead husband you arent the only one. Bates nicely bitter as Hollys mother wonders the same thing often. Adding to the oddness is Connick as Daniel a fellow who works in Hollys moms bar and suffers from some sort of malady that renders him incapable of filtering his thoughts before uttering them. So we learn early on how he feels about Holly (see if you can guess). At more than two hours P.S. I Love You takes a long time to get where its going which isnt all that far. Its not that its an out-and-out bad movie. Its just not a memorable one. So it goes with P.S. I Love You. Youll laugh Youll cry Youll forget it five minutes after its over And maybe thats not such a bad thing. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

I Love You John Anderson 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr December 13 2007 | 1228PM PT The question of love after death has been asked frequently enough in the movies but seldom with the high ick factor found in ""P.S. I Love You."" The question of love after death has been asked frequently enough in the movies but seldom with the high ick factor found in ""P.S. I Love You."" ""Ghost"" with a brogue ""The Notebook"" without the burden of old people this post-life comedy will have the sentimentally challenged weeping openly while clutching desperately to the pants-legs of boyfriends and husbands who are trying to flee up the aisle. Richard LaGraveneses trip into Lifetime territory may define the guilty pleasure of the genre. In the films long long pre-credits opening Gerry (Gerard Butler) performs a striptease as LaGravenese sets up his near-perfect marriage to Holly (Hilary Swank) that is about to be sabotaged by Gerrys yet-to-be-diagnosed brain tumor. As for Swank she spends just enough time in her underwear to suggest an effort to eroticize the star of ""Boys Dont Cry"" and ""Freedom Writers"" while trying to recover from her husbands premature death and attending to all the things Gerrys arranged for her to do. You wonder how shes going to do it-shes like an overscheduled child on the Upper East Side. We dont see Gerry during his illness -- what fun would that be? -- but apparently the man was lucid enough to plot out Hollys entire year post-Gerry instructions for which are enclosed in letters delivered through mysterious means and which always include the title of the film (sob ...) as well as directives for party-going karaoke singing and throwing out his stuff. LaGravenese who is better known for having scripted ""The Fisher King"" ""A Little Princess"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County"" than for directing the respectable ""Living Out Loud"" and ""Freedom Writers"" leaves no sentimental stone unturned in what for the charismatic Scotsman Butler is a painful exercise in Irish-accented emoting and manufactured charm. Swank cheerful yet grief-stricken as Holly gives a decent enough performance as do Gina Gershon and Lisa Kudrow as the sidekicks who usher Holly through her mourning and whose lives move on even as Hollys doesnt. The idea of an ostensibly liberated woman living in Manhattan (despite having no visible means of support) and being dictated to by her late spouse may seem incongruous to some and offensive to others. But to still others it will spell a romantic ideal embodied in a dead guy who cared enough to plan an entire year of his widows life replete with a trip to Ireland and a push toward new romantic horizons. Will she end up with Daniel (Harry Connick Jr.) who is charming but seems to suffer from a form of autism (seriously)? Or with Gerrys childhood friend William (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) whom she just happens to meet/sleep with while traveling through the Emerald Isle? As an exercise in chick-flickery ""P.S. I Love You"" wants to possess the soulfulness of harsh reality and the lilt of romantic fantasy at the same time. In this case at least it simply cant be done. P.S.

Posted December 12 2007 -- 1200 AM EST I know youre supposed to just go with the premise of this chick pap Hunky Irishguy (300s Gerard Butler dining in hell) dies from a brain tumor that never affected his good looks but not before leaving love letters to cheer his shoe-collecting wife (Hilary Swank) in her first year of widowhood. FYI theres zero chemistry between P.S. I Love Yous two commodified headliners. P.S. The plus in the harsh grade goes solely to the divine Lisa Kudrow delivering desperately needed laughs as the twitchy widows husband-hunting best friend.
