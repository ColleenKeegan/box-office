This is not a movie for the faint of heart. Spun from the twisted imagination of novelist Thomas Harris who has a clammy genius for creating serial-killer psychopaths Jonathan Demmes terrifying thriller features one psycho nicknamed Buffalo Bill who murders and skins young women and another a former psychiatrist who eats his victims. This is evil of a particularly baroque flourish and readers of the novel might wonder how Demme could bring such nastiness to the screen without crossing the line of stomach-turning exploitation. You might even wonder why the maker of ""Melvin and Howard"" and ""Something Wild"" would be drawn to such nightmarish stuff but only if youve forgotten his B-movie roots (""Caged Heat"") or his 1979 Hitchcockian excursion ""Last Embrace."" Demmes justification is up there on the screen ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is an electrifying exercise in suspense. One need only have a healthy appetite for fear to acknowledge that thrillers dont get much more thrilling.Can Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) be stopped before he kills his latest captive the daughter (Brooke Smith) of a Tennessee senator? Thats the motor that drives the plot but the heart of the movie lies elsewhere in the relationship between the heroine FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) and that cannibalistic shrink Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Lecter who also appears in Harriss ""Red Dragon"" is a great pop creation - a depraved genius with near-omnipotent insight into the minds of other serial killers. Clarice is sent by her FBI mentor Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to interrogate Lecter in his high-security prison cell hoping that he can lead her to Buffalo Bill. In return for information what he wants from Clarice whose ambition to escape her white-trash West Virginia roots he instantly divines is a glimpse into her soul. The monstrous Lecter becomes her father confessor and shrink - as well as a kind of intellectual suitor. Their scenes together (shot in enormous close-up) have a horrific weirdly erotic intimacy. He savors her confessions like a connoisseur sniffing vintage wine. Lecter is a role any actor would kill for and Hopkins has vicious fun with it. Still watchful deeply droll and infinitely sinister he becomes the high priest of criminal psychosis.Fosters fiercely committed performance matches him step by step. From our first sight of her running through the woods at the FBI training camp shes a woman in constant motion - a striver grimly driven to escape her own childhood nightmares. Foster has to play her part in a perpetual state of controlled anxiety. Like the movie she wastes no motion giving us quick sharp glimpses into Clarices defensive determined heart. Its the strongest womans action role since Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens."" Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Screenwriter Ted Tally does an excellent job streamlining the novel and Demme tightens the screws with a mastery that would make any horror veteran jealous. Superbly edited (by Craig McKay) and shot (by Tak Fujimoto) ""The Silence of the Lambs"" makes its cliffhangers fake-outs and penny-dreadful devices seem newly minted it breathes fresh contemporary air into the damsel-in-distress genre. Even the broadest most hackneyed character - the vain jealous Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald) who resents Clarices success with ""his"" patient Dr. Lecter and gums up the investigation to satisfy his bruised ego-pays off supplying some necessary comic relief. This is the grandest guignol Hollywood has produced in years.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Comments Red Dragon Anthony Hopkins returns yet again as Hannibal Lecter though this adaptation of Thomas Harriss first Lecter novel is more reminiscent of The Silence of the Lambs than of 2001s Hannibal. Edward Norton continuing to squander all that press calling him ""the finest actor of his generation"" plays an FBI agent who nabs the diabolical doctor then takes on a case involving two families who have been slaughtered in their beds and must turn to the mad psychiatrist for help. Ralph Fiennes plays the murderer a sort of watered-down Norman Bates and Emily Watson is the blind girl whos got a thing for him; Frank Whaley and Philip Seymour Hoffman play minor characters so annoying they might as well wear T-shirts reading ""Eat My Brain.""

"Red Dragon is no Manhunter. Slate Sign In Sign Up Red Dragon is no Manhunter. Red Dragon is no Manhunter. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 4 2002 1207 PM Red Drag Red Dragon is no Manhunter. By David Edelstein If only it could keep him from chewing scenery The best thing about Red Dragon (Universal) the second adaptation of Thomas Harris 1981 novel is that it reminds you how scary and seminal the first adaptation--Michael Manns Manhunter (1986)--was. This new movie directed by Brett Ratner recycles the same narrative many of the same lines and even some of the same camera set-ups but it stubbornly refuses to haunt. It more or less works Harris book is a landmark in its (unsavory) genre and Ted Tallys screenplay is maybe 95 percent faithful. Tally actually improves on Harris climax with a nifty psychological coup; and theres a fun new prologue in which Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) presides over a grande bouffe (dont ask whats on the plate) before FBI profiler Will Graham (Edward Norton) arrives for a nearly fatal late-night consultation. But in between you could be watching a plodding Hollywood-studio remake of some idiosyncratic foreign classic The beats are the same but the eerie vibe has been lost in translation. Advertisement Manhunter--filmed under the title Red Dragon but changed because the studio thought it sounded vaguely Japanese--featured CSIs William Petersen as Graham and Tom Noonan as the deformed serial killer Francis Dolarhyde who enters the houses of sleeping suburban families and butchers them then puts shards of mirrors in their eyes so he can see his ""reflected glory."" It also featured a subdued Brian Cox in the peripheral (but thematically central) role of Lecter (for some reason spelled ""Lector"") the forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic madman who had nearly killed Graham some years before. The use of this sociopath as a consultant--a sort of psycho-killer emeritus--was at the time rather shocking although its now the stuff of Austin Powers parodies. Few movies open as disturbingly as Manhunter. The camera--to the accompaniment of a droning synthesizer--follows the beam of a flashlight through a dark house up a staircase to a bedroom where a couple lies asleep. The beam falls on the woman who tosses briefly then sits up and stares into the harsh light--whereupon the image mercifully goes black. This is of course the trek of Dolarhyde who will slaughter the family in that house; but it could also be the vision of Petersens Graham as he relives the night of carnage while staring at crime-scene glossies and bloodstained chalk-outlines. Theyre on the same eerie wavelength. Manhunter is a movie with obvious howlers a Miami-Vice-like overreliance on synthesized sludge like Red 7s ""Heartbeat"" (although Iron Butterflys ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" works like a dream); a tendency to dress all the characters in 1000 suits; the use of a modernist art museum as the exterior of a psychiatric prison. But its scenes of Graham wandering the crime scene and murmuring into his tape recorder are mesmerizing. Manhunter sired CSI and John Doe and Profiler and Millennium and all the other TV shows and movies that borrowed both Harris theme and Manns hypnotic tone. After this thrillers would not only become positively fetishistic about forensics theyd also tend to fixate on a single protagonist who would wander fresh murder sites and re-live the slaughter from the killers point-of-view--who would be able at a terrible cost to plunge deep into a psychos roiling psyche. Manhunter ushered in the age of empathy for the devil. Manhunter wasnt a hit but it was shown a lot on TV after Silence of the Lambs (1991) became a phenomenon. (It was even affixed with a nonsensical subtitle--""The Pursuit of Hannibal Lecter."" He was already behind bars) After last years Hannibal made gazillions someone at Dino De Laurentiis company (which owns the rights to the Lecter character) decided that this particular udder should be given another milking. Red Dragon is being sold as the first chapter of the ""Hannibal Lecter trilogy"" but its really the last chapter in the ""Anthony Hopkins hambone trilogy."" Hopkins Lecter is like Bela Lugosi a seething extrovert a short step from the jokey host of some Tales From the Crypt-style horror series. (You can picture him looking up from his plate and saying ""The man in the story youre about to see was a very naughty boy which is why Im eating his pancreas."") A pale reflection of a better movie Graham is now Edward Norton who can be a good nervy actor but whose gangly boy-scout demeanor and reedy tenor dont begin to suggest the profilers unsavory depths. When Hopkins purrs ""You caught me because were very much alike"" it seems as if Lecter is deranged He has zero in common with this Gomer Pyle. The same line in Manhunter was palpably true Cox and Petersen had the same morbid sadness and so did Tom Noonan as the killer. (The name Dolarhyde suggests a Mr. Hyde borne of woe; the towering Noonan was like Petersen and Cox stretched out.) But the three actors in Red Dragon inhabit different histrionic universes. Thats not a small point in a story in which each character is obsessed with getting into the heads of the others. Ralph Fiennes with his chill blue eyes and gun-metal baritone might have made a fascinating Graham but he has been cast as Dolarhyde. Partly because of how hes photographed and directed his psychosis has no mythic stature. When he travels to the Brooklyn Museum to eat the Blake painting that inspired his Red Dragon persona (a sequence that didnt make it into Manhunter) he might as well be munching a burrito. As the blind woman who decides to seduce him Emily Watson somewhat overdoes the wide-eyed thing but her sneaky eroticism gives the picture its lone touch of mystery. Ratner apes some of Jonathan Demmes visual strategies from Silence of the Lambs; but Demme was coming from such wonderful movies as Melvin and Howard (1980) and Something Wild (1986) His close-ups of Lecter (inevitably in the middle of the screen) made for an unnerving departure from the loose frames of his usually bustling humanist universe. Ratners relentless close-ups are those of a schlockmeister getting in your face. Our first view of the blood-drenched walls and carpet comes with an orchestral BONG and the grisly fate of the tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds (Philip Seymour Hoffman slumming schlumpily for his big paycheck) is treated as a joke. When Graham finally deduces how the killer is choosing his victims--one of the great moments in the book and in Manhunter and one of the great moments in detective literature period--it has almost no emotional weight. Ratner is such an inexpressive filmmaker that he needs those BONGs or you dont know how to react. That he has reportedly disparaged Manhunter puts him in the pantheon of the unworthies. Lecter would fix him with fava beans and a nice Chianti. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Dr. Hannibal Lecter (ANTHONY HOPKINS) never drops his guard. Photo Glen Wilson Copyright 2002 Universal Studios. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Photo HANDOUT Dragon has no bite / All-star cast fails to make Silence of the Lambs prequel appetizing 1 / 2 Back to Gallery RED DRAGON Suspense thriller. Starring Edward Norton Ralph Fiennes Anthony Hopkins Emily Watson Philip Seymour Hoffman Harvey Keitel and Mary Louise Parker. Directed by Brett Ratner. Written by Ted Tally. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theatres.) In Hollywood where integrity is rapidly consumed and careers defined by market value theres trash and theres trash with a pedigree. ""Red Dragon"" an all-star prequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is based on the 1981 Thomas Harris novel that introduced Hannibal Lecter to the world and falls solidly into the second category. Anthony Hopkins is back as Lecter caressing his dialogue with sensuous slurps mocking the world with his all-knowing eyes. Hes joined by one of the strongest casts of the year Edward Norton as Will Graham the FBI investigator who captured Hannibal and understands him a bit too well; Ralph Fiennes as the title character a serial killer who worships Lecter; Philip Seymour Hoffman as a tabloid reporter whose work thrives because of Lecter; and Emily Watson as a blind woman who falls for the Lecter wannabe. Amazing isnt it how even world-class actors like Fiennes Watson and Mary Louise Parker (as Nortons wife) are so easily seduced? ""Red Dragon"" is a grisly amped-up thriller that doesnt challenge or dignify their talent but it obviously has the potential to expand their profile and boost their asking price. For what its worth ""Red Dragon"" isnt as gruesome or disgusting as ""Hannibal"" the last Lecter movie in which the epicurean cannibal famously opened a mans skull -- as if it were a steamed clam -- and feasted daintily off his brains. Fine wine was served. Directed by Brent Ratner (""Family Man"" ""Rush Hour II"") and written by ""Silence"" screenwriter Ted Tally ""Red Dragon"" was first adapted as ""Manhunter "" a 1986 film by Michael Mann with Brian Cox as Lecter. This version which lifts material from a prologue that Harris added for a revised edition of his book focuses less on Hannibal than it does on Graham and the Tooth Fairy the tabloid moniker for Fiennes schizoid killer. ""Red Dragon"" opens in flashback when Lecter nearly kills Graham and jumps forward several years to the Florida Keys retreat where Graham has escaped with his wife and child his stomach still scarred by the Lecter-applied puncture wound. The FBI is on the tail of a serial killer -- two families were slaughtered at home under a full moon their eye sockets stuffed with shattered glass -- and the bureau wants Graham back on the team. Grahams wife begs him to stay where he is safe and retired (""Were paid off"") but Graham convinced that he can avert another massacre acquiesces to his old boss (Harvey Keitel). Gradually ""Red Dragon"" introduces the Fiennes character an emotional disaster whose grandmother bullied him as a child and who seeks deliverance from his trauma through the mythic work of the English poet and artist William Blake. A blind co-worker (Watson) takes a fancy to Fiennes never sensing his lethal personality split; the reporter (Hoffman so scummy we can smell him) gets dangerously close to the killer; and Graham a more schooled equivalent to FBI agent Clarice Starling combines instinct and forensic skills to find and neutralize the Tooth Fairy. ""Red Dragon"" has a suitably dark dread-inducing look with photography by Dante Spinotti (""L.A. Confidential"") and sets by ""Silence of the Lambs"" production designer Kristi Zea. The actors have a good workout and Hopkins earns his enormous paycheck but at days end it all feels like a revved-up market-driven rehash of a once-thrilling film. Lecter disintegrated into shtick long ago and ""Red Dragon"" hasnt the imagination to restore our interest. Advisory This film contains violence raw language nudity.

"CNN.com - Review Dragon worthy follower to Lambs - Oct. 3 2002 CNN Europe CNN Asia Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese On CNN TV Transcripts Headline News CNN International About CNN.com Preferences Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Review Dragon worthy follower to Lambs Effective acting from all-star cast By Paul Clinton (CNN) Story Tools (CNN) -- In ""Red Dragon"" the prequel to 1991s ""Silence Of The Lambs"" Sir Anthony Hopkins -- who won an Academy Award for his earlier portrayal of Hannibal Lecter -- proves once again that Lecter is the most terrifying villain in cinematic history. ""Dragon"" also achieves the near impossible It washes the bad taste out of your mouth from the hideous sequel to ""Lambs"" the despicable ""Hannibal."" This films remarkable effectiveness is also due to the fact that ""Silence"" screenwriter Ted Tally who won an Academy Award for ""Lambs"" is back along with a stellar cast including Emily Watson Ralph Fiennes Edward Norton Mary-Louise Parker Philip Seymour Hoffman and Harvey Keitel. RELATED CNN ACCESS Hopkins sinks teeth in Red Dragon  TIME.com Hannibal Inc.  EW.COM All about Red Dragon This story has been told once before in 1986 under the title of ""Manhunter"" starring Brian Cox as Hannibal and directed by Michael Mann. This time the filmmakers have returned to the title of Thomas Harris novel ""Red Dragon"" and this film is more true to Harris original concept. In a brilliant move Tally begins the film with a cold open in which we meet Dr. Lecter in the early 1980s. At the time he is still a respected psychiatrist in Baltimore and a member in good standing on the board of the local symphony orchestra. Then comes a series of brief -- and highly effective -- vignettes in which we see how Lecter is captured. Over the opening credits we see newspaper headlines describing his crimes the publics horrified reaction to them and his subsequent imprisonment for life. Getting to know the villains RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.COM  Movie reviews As in ""Silence Of The Lambs"" the imprisoned Lecter is sought out by an FBI agent for help getting into the mind of another serial killer still on the loose. This time the villains a ritualistic butcher known as the Tooth Fairy (Fiennes) and the FBI agent is Will Graham (Norton). Graham is no stranger to Lecter. He is in fact the man who caught Lecter and in the process nearly died at Lecters hand. Now Graham has retired only to be lured back into service by his old boss Jack Crawford (Keitel). This may all sound very similar to ""Lambs"" but in this case we actually get to know the killer whose real name is Francis Dolarhyde simply known as D. Tally in fact has given D a compelling back story not included in Harris book. Watson in another carefully nuanced performance plays a shy blind woman named Reba who works with D and is attracted to his shyness. Reba also shares Ds contempt for others who take pity on people with physical abnormalities. In his case its a cleft palate which has resulted in a distorting scar on his upper lip. Tallys tightly crafted script interweaves Grahams desperate search for the killer the strange relationship between D and Reba and Hannibals diabolical efforts to manipulate the entire situation while secretly aiding and abetting D in his downward spiral into complete insanity. This films enormous emotional punch comes both from the written word and the astounding acting provided by this remarkable cast. Seams between the scenes But there is one plot point for which you simply must suspend your disbelief or the rest of the film will drive you crazy. Lecter -- who is kept under the most tightly guarded conditions who is shackled head to toe whenever he leaves his cell a hideous killer known for his devious cleverness -- is allowed what appears to be complete access to mail communication. Hes even allowed to place ads in newspapers with apparently no restrictions. That doesnt ring true. But its all essential to the plot so either let it go or dont go. This films enormous emotional punch comes both from the written word and the astounding acting provided by this remarkable cast. -- Paul Clinton The only other fly in this cinematic ointment is that the direction from Brett Ratner (2000s ""Family Man"" and the two ""Rush Hour"" movies) is fairly predestrian. You can see the seams between the scenes. He even made a remarkable confession in a recent issue of Premiere magazine saying that there where days when he was screamed at at least once by every member of the cast. This is not a director in control of his film. The score by Danny Elfman is excellent and the cinematography by Dante Spinotti (""L.A. Confidential"") is stunning. This film may not sweep the Academy Awards as ""Silence of the Lambs"" did but it is good solid entertainment that is well worth your time and money. ""Red Dragon"" opens nationwide on Friday and is rated R.

Literally. Just the taunt of the actors opaque-marble eyeballs - maddeningly unfocused glazed with an impermeable mix of insanity and brilliance lids pulled halfway up like window shades that flutter but never close - is enough to telegraph everything we already know fear and love about the movies most erudite psychopath. The tighter a camera zooms in on Hopkins full-moon head the more chilling the effect of the distilled menace he projects. The man doesnt move and we dance to his pulse. But then after the definitive terrors of Jonathan Demmes ""The Silence of the Lambs"" in 1991 and the noisy Grand Guignol gore of Ridley Scotts ""Hannibal"" last year the minutiae of mannerisms that make up Hopkins Lecter are familiar enough to be ladled into punchlines involving fava beans. The madman psychiatrists orthodontia-of-the-damned restraining face masks are well-known enough to sell at Halloween. When we think of Hannibal we think of Hopkins. Thats a triumph and a curse for Red Dragon a thriller made from a completists checklist rather than with a cultists passion. Its based on the first of Thomas Harris three Lecter novels when the character was new as a deranged genius locked up in prison solitary hungry for haute cuisine preferably with a side dish of human meat. But its Hopkins third time in the role. By now he propels the character with his ocular muscles like a bored athlete looking to amuse himself. And perhaps spooked by the famous franchise in his hands director Brett Ratner (a long way from ""Rush Hour"") cant seem to find a fresh recipe to make his own. The 1981 novel is set in a time before Lecter met Clarice Starling the FBI trainee who would so memorably eat at his heart in ""Lambs"" (the roles would win both Hopkins and Jodie Foster Oscars for their pains as Lecter and Starling) Before there was Clarice there was Will Graham (Edward Norton) an FBI investigator no less perceptive than her and no less traumatized by association with Hannibal the Cannibal. Before there was Jame ""Buffalo Bill"" Gumb there was Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes) known as the Tooth Fairy who killed sleeping families with ritualistic exactitude. Everyone familiar with ""The Silence of the Lambs"" will see of course that once again a monster slayer needs the help of one monster in order to catch another that once again a serial killer is motivated by a sick notion of self-improvement and that the triangular dynamic of the intimate relationships endows the story with a great geometric strength. But ""once again"" is a problem While director Ratner and screenwriter Ted Tally (who won an Oscar for his ""Silence"" script) need to convince us that this is an unfamiliarly younger angrier less seasoned jailhouse inmate - a Lecter who hasnt yet decided how best to run his universe from behind bars - every synapse of the collective audience memory bank is receiving Hopkins performance based on what we already want and expect from Our Hannibal. Every nerve ending is wired to watch ""Red Dragon"" as a sequel rather than as a precursor. Edward Norton appropriately earnest and focused as his Graham is (and Norton does a nice job of layering resolve over fear) is inevitably assessed as another pale successor to the phenomenal Foster. Fiennes baroquely bizarre Dolarhyde - another in the increasingly haggard actors collection of increasingly strange character choices - is meticulously assembled out of colorful tics and outbursts but the sight of his bare tattooed butt only brings to mind the more mysterious (and thus creepier) activities of the skin-scavenging Buffalo Bill. (Emily Watson chooses familiar girlfriend-of-the-damaged territory for herself as the tremulously trusting blind woman Dolarhyde tentatively courts.) Following the wanton frenzies of ""Hannibal"" ""Red Dragon"" wisely returns to the wiles of impending and suggested violence rather than the spectacle of bloody geysers. But producer Dino De Laurentiis knows what he wants or maybe what he thinks we want. We want Anthony Hopkins soft intimate voice burred with mockery. We want the precise gestures the slicked-back hair the slow fluid movements interrupted by bite-the-nose-off impulses from our old friend and his dinner guests. We get them - at the expense of a Lecter movie that really scares or excites. For that try ""Manhunter"" Michael Manns own sleek unimprovable 1986 adaptation of ""Red Dragon"" in which Brian Cox plays a less ornately rabid Hannibal William Petersen presages his ""CSI"" celebrity as Graham and Tom Noonan scares the crap out of us as the Tooth Fairy. There is some small elegance in Dante Spinottis participation as ""Red Dragon""s director of photography since ""Manhunter"" was the veteran Italian cinematographers first American production. To Manns 80s thriller about men and vice Spinotti brought striking vistas of psychic emptiness mixed with sexy flash. Appropriately for Ratners 2002 nostalgia trip he photographs serial killing to look like comfort food.

Even to the multitudes familiar with every detail of Thomas Harris first installment of the Lecter trilogy as well as with Michael Manns estimable first screen version ""Manhunter"" Brett Ratners immaculately appointed new telling of the inescapably creepy tale will be an unnerving experience. Hannibal Lecter scores again in ""Red Dragon."" Even to the multitudes familiar with every detail of Thomas Harris first installment of the Lecter trilogy as well as with Michael Manns estimable first screen version ""Manhunter"" Brett Ratners faithful immaculately appointed new telling of the inescapably creepy tale will be an intense unnerving experience. An outstanding cast led by Edward Norton and Anthony Hopkins in his third outing as the carnivore from Baltimore lends a classy veneer to this sure-fire commercial attraction. ""Red Dragon"" is an odd project in a number of ways being a remake of the 1986 film that itself adhered pretty closely to the 1981 novel despite the distinctively contemplative tone Manns visual abstractions and the heavy electronic score brought to the material. Both ""Manhunter"" and the new picture have the same producer Dino De Laurentiis as well as the same cinematographer Dante Spinotti and there are any number of near-identical lines of dialogue. On top of that Hopkins here reprises a role he originated in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" 11 years ago although the action in ""Red Dragon"" begins at least eight years before that of ""Lambs."" Jonathan Demmes multi-Oscar winner is directly recalled in numerous other ways from the expert carpentry of screenwriter Ted Tally and the presence of some of the same actors (Anthony Heald Frankie Faison) in their old parts to the use of identical locations and the return of production designer Kristi Zea whose reproduction of Lecters basement cell carries the odd frisson of an old home week. So audiences will be excused for any feelings of deja vu the new film might inspire. That wont prevent them from watching it in rapt anxious silence however as the gruesome crimes twisted psychology and deterministic dread that lie at the heart of Harris work are laid out with care and skill. Ratners previous credits on ""The Family Man"" and the ""Rush Hour"" pictures may not have inspired confidence that he was the right man for this job but the director has done a serious responsible job of conveying the drama and menace inherent in this tale of an FBI mans urgent search for a methodical serial killer. Furthermore hes shown intelligent restraint unlike Ridley Scott when he indulged every potential excess available in the frightening but overwrought ""Hannibal"" last year."" ""Red Dragon"" may not possess the nuance and under-your-skin insidiousness of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" but its interest lies in deepening the material not warping it. First step in this regard was to expand Lecters role a task tackled at the outset in a gripping eight-minute prologue that reveals how FBI investigator Will Graham (Norton) captured Lecter after some bloody mano a mano that left both men close to death. To contrast Manns and Ratners approaches all thats necessary is to look at the opening scenes proper which serve precisely the same narrative function of having Graham lured out of Florida retirement by his old bureau superior to help track down an insidious murderer who has just wiped out two families in identical ways and who almost certainly will strike again with the next full moon. Manns artfully stripped down compositions and placement of his actors against the sea and sky gave his film a metaphysical quality drenched in a sense of mournful inevitability. Ratners crisp more businesslike style has a narrower purposeful focus dedicating itself to expressing apprehension through economical dialogue and subtle acting. Graham is called back by former boss Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) due to his unusual adaptability to the mindset of murderers his ability to think like them and therefore to catch them through anticipation of their moves. Reluctantly leaving his wife (Mary-Louise Parker) and son behind Graham shortly entices the cooperation of Lecter whos helped him before and just may have some insights into the methods of the so-called Tooth Fairy whose slaying techniques have included propping up dead family members with mirror shards over their eyes as an ""audience"" for what he does to the final victim. At about the 45-minute point the audience although not Graham is introduced to the killer. Francis Dolarhyde (Ralph Fiennes) called ""shy boy"" by Lecter is a peculiar loner whose handsome looks are disfigured by a nose-to-lip cleft. Aside from beefing up the running time for Lecter who as memorably impersonated by Brian Cox appeared in only two scenes in ""Manhunter"" ""Dragon"" is concerned with providing psychological backstory for Dolarhyde who was terribly abused as a child and for whom mass murder is a major element in his effort at self-transformation. A profound admirer of Lecter and a devotee of the mystical poet and painter William Blake Dolarhyde finds his resolve slightly weakened by the attentions of Reba McClane (Emily Watson) a blind co-worker at a film lab whose vulnerability is exceeded only by her emotional accessibility and ability to connect with Dolarhydes insecurities. While the loony agonizes over what to do about Reba and Graham slowly closes in on his prey Lecter sitting calmly in his stone-lined cell shrewdly plays both sides against each other giving Graham helpful tidbits while feeding information to the Tooth Fairy that puts Grahams family at the top of the killers hit list. By the time of the dramas spectacularly fiery climax faithful to the book as ""Manhunter"" was not the sense of cumulative tension is so palpable as to be almost oppressive. Startling follow-up scene proves even more intense and serves as an effective bookend to the prologues battle between Graham and Lecter. In undertaking a project destined to be held to close scrutiny Ratner could not have surrounded himself with an array of more skilled professionals both behind and in front of the camera. Once again Hopkins is mesmerizing as Lecter and concerns about the age differential prove unjustified. If anything the biggest difference in the actors appearance now versus a decade ago would seem to be in the increased size of his upper torso; otherwise he may look a tad older but not in any way that one sits there dwelling upon while watching the picture. Filling William Petersens sizeable shoes as Graham Norton gives a minutely calibrated performance that ably illustrates how the investigators mounting obsession overcomes his promise to his wife not to lose himself in the case. Fiennes once again proves chillingly adept at portraying a psychotic who cant keep from killing Watson is an affecting open book as the sightless woman who gets under the murderers skin and Philip Seymour Hoffman socks over his showy role as an amoral tabloid journalist who becomes far more involved with his subject than he intends. Of all the films outstanding craft contributions notably Spinottis rich lensing Zeas evocative production design and Mark Helfrichs smart editing none boosts the proceedings more crucially than Danny Elfmans score which uses strings to more suspenseful effect than anyone since the heyday of Bernard Herrmann and otherwise employs unusual instrumentation to add flavor to an outstandingly conceived traditional soundtrack.
