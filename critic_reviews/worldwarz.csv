"Get Rich or Die Trying << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The Full NBA Job Interview Ben McLemore  Next T-Mac Tries Again A24 Facebook Twitter Print Brad Pitt Get Rich or Die Trying Sofia Coppola hip-hop and zombies by Wesley Morris on June 20 2013 Self-awareness isnt everything. But with some directors its enough. Sofia Coppola is making a career out of it. Her movies -- The Virgin Suicides Lost in Translation Marie Antoinette Somewhere -- are about the toxins of privilege and the downsides of vanity. But they leave Coppola vulnerable to being called privileged and vain herself. With Coppola eyes will roll. The opening credits of The Bling Ring get the narcissism charge right out of the way. A montage ends with the camera sailing above a spread of trinkets and stopping at a charm bracelet that says ""rich bitch."" This is where Coppola has chosen to put her ""directed by."" She owns the irony. My feelings about this movie havent changed since I saw it a month ago. Well-off high school kids break into the homes of the rich and famous and steal some of their stuff. Its smart and droll. Coppola looks at the robberies and aspiration and materialism with the sugared piquancy that Baz Luhrmann uses for The Great Gatsby and Harmony Korine tries out for some of Spring Breakers. Theyre all movies about the obsession with stuff and leisure and adoration movies that are also rooted in hip-hop. The Bling Rings soundtrack has music by Sleigh Bells deadmau5 and Can. But the songs the characters actually hear are usually rap. The girls snarl their way through Rick Rosss ""9 Piece"" in the car. On a different night its Kanye Wests ""All of the Lights."" When Coppolas protagonist a sweet-faced fashionisto named Marc (Israel Broussard) has a moment alone hes listening to Ester Deans club hit ""Drop It Low"" which has assistance from Lil Wayne and Chris Brown. The scene is shot entirely from the point of view of his laptop camera. Its in grainy black-and-white and situated so that were looking up at him while he takes drags from a pot pipe flings his hair turns his back to the computer and grants Deans wish to see that ""booty booty booty pop."" Aside from the sight of Emma Watson doing a luscious slow-motion dance-floor bounce that moment with Marc is the movies most fun. This music isnt the reason these kids rob. But its in their system. Their lust for luxury brands and hunger for celebrity are as much a part of where hip-hop has wound up on Rodeo Drive. Young white Americas early relationship to rap began in rebellious aspiration. Young black Americas relationship to it began in identification. Success has lifted rappers up -- off the streets out of the ghetto away from jail. Theyre rich. Theyre famous. They have what the kids want in The Bling Ring fashion lines and fragrances. Jay-Z and Kanye West recorded a whole masterpiece about the anxiety of their affluence. 2011s Watch the Throne was entirely devoted to the physical and psychological defense of the kings theyd become. They didnt want to be mistaken for arrivistes. They had arrived. They were royalty and they were paranoid. Acquisition has always been part of hip-hop rappers rapping about their stuff and their territory ""my Adidas"" ""my radio"" ""my part of town."" But thats quaint. Now its ""my Bugatti"" a car whose asking price is about 1.4 million. The game as they say has changed. Last week the Beastie Boys Mike D and his wife Tamra Davis -- the director of the Chris Rock rap-industry parody CB4 -- unveiled their tastefully renovated Brooklyn brownstone to the New York Times. The talent-agency arm of Jay-Zs business empire is now poaching professional athletes from established firms. Jay-Z has expressed empathy with the ascent of Jay Gatsby from nothing to something and that empathy culminated in his curating the soundtrack of Luhrmanns movie. Luhrmann didnt make the hip-hop Gatsby he might have dreamed about but its almost poignant the way the films embarrassing minstrel flourishes imply what in a more daring movie could have been. Still the scene in which Jays shirt collection rains down on Daisy Buchanan is straight from the book but it also feels straight outta Kanye a man who last week told Jon Caramanica in the New York Times that some of the inspiration for his new record came from a Le Corbusier lamp. Rap and hip-hop culture have gone from being ""black Americas CNN"" to the entire countrys E The incidents dramatized in The Bling Ring took place in 2008 and 2009. The victims of the ring were people readers of Dlisted.com wanted to be back then stars of the reality show The Hills Paris Hilton Megan Fox and Lindsay Lohan. The Kardashians were around but they werent the thing that they soon would become. This was before the release of Watch the Throne and before Kanye got mixed up with Kim. But its not hard to imagine the capers Coppola coolly depicts being targeted at ""Kimye"" and West misconstruing the adulation for hateration. As it is West is the pivotal figure in raps transition from extroversion to introversion from the sociological to the psychological. Hes held on to the musics sense of self-assurance but hes given it both a certifiable persecution complex and stunning narcissism. In The Bling Ring when Watsons character stands before news cameras and announces that her arrest and conviction havent disqualified her from national leadership its precisely the sort of unapologetic delusion West continues to express say about his attempt to steal a Moonman statuette from Taylor Swift. Wittingly or not Coppolas film connects hip-hops migration from the realm of have-not/have-some/have-it-all to the age of disillusionment with having arrived. Marc is the movies outsider. Hes gay loosely conscientious and insecure about his looks. He falls in love with the rich-bitch glamour of the gangs leader an icy operator named Rebecca (Katie Chang). Shes his gateway to drugs luxury and a pair of hot-pink Louboutins. Eventually the sprees end the gang turns on itself and Marc is left slightly beside himself. Hes an outsider one similar to the narrator in the Frank Ocean song that plays over the closing credits ""Super Rich Kids."" Of course as much as hip-hop provides the unifying undergirding of both The Bling Ring and Spring Breakers and the 21st-century spine of the 1920s in The Great Gatsby and as vital as that culture is to these movies the privilege that each embodies makes no room to include hip-hop as more than a boutique for taste-making and street cred. You really dont want to hear West go on a tirade about how things still arent equal at the movies but hed be making a valid point. Film stardom remains elusive. West and Jay-Z might indeed have it all but they dont yet have that. Zombies are the last horror species that can still scare you. Werewolves and vampires want to be our friends and future exes. They have book clubs and fan fiction. Zombies just have the teen necrophilia of Warm Bodies and they seem pissed about it. Whatever it is that vampires are supposed to stand for now has more to do with what we want -- sex -- than who we are. Zombies? Zombies are us. Thats the fear anyway. If a zombie gets you youre more than screwed more than no longer alive. Youre ... a zombie. Good zombie entertainment -- George Romeros Dead films Danny Boyles two 28 films the occasional episode of The Walking Dead -- establishes the threat maintains an air of dread gradually erodes the line between our savagery and that of the zombies and perhaps weaves in some sociopolitical critique. The only rule is Dont get infected. Dont wind up a tweaked-out power-walking cannibal. The zombies in World War Z sprint the way girls do when their pheromones detect Justin Bieber. Ive never seen anything prey upon people the way the zombies do here in great rushing rapids. The enduring image from the advertising is an aerial shot of a tsunami of bodies urgently piling up high against a concrete barrier until its breached. But like everything else in this lousy ugly-looking intensely illogical movie that moment conveys none of the visceral thrill you need from a zombie thriller none of the claustrophobia. It doesnt even look real. I dont mean that it doesnt look possible. I mean it looks fake like weve been given a hard drive of unfinished video-game scenarios. Most of the film which is available in 3-D looks computerized and like youre watching through a glass ashtray. Even when the suns out its often that murky. The shots whiz by even faster than the zombies do. Nearly every scene has been photographed with handheld cameras. The presumable conceit is that were panicking in the mosh pit too. But all the shaking and jostling and veering and all the split-second editing produces a movie that never slows down enough to earn your fear. The story doesnt unfold. It gushes. It spews. And whats it spewing anyway? This is a tale of monumental disaster scarcely adapted from Max Brookss novel and starring Brad Pitt as a retired high-level U.N. investigator named Gerry Lane. When hell breaks loose he and his family are whisked to an aircraft carrier where Thierry (Fana Mokoena) the U.N. deputy secretary general coerces Gerry into venturing off into chaos to find some kind of cure. Only by accepting the mission are his wife and two daughters guaranteed safety on the carrier. So off he goes trotting the globe happening upon a succession of would-be insulting political commentaries like the barrier the Israelis have erected in Jerusalem to keep out the zombies which for Brooks was the flash point for his allegorical geopolitical ambitions. In the film you know the attention to detail was iffy when no one seemed to think it was a bad idea to name two of your major characters ""Gerry"" and ""Thierry."" It sounds like theyre talking to themselves. The production of World War Z was reportedly a troubled one. This might explain why so much of it feels so rushed and the rest is so confusing and dull why Matthew Fox appears for about four seconds and Mireille Enos as Pitts missus has nothing more to do than hand Gerrys phone calls to Thierry. Of course some of that might also be a matter of the films having been made by Marc Forster a flashy director with no distinctive style or taste or point of view. Monsters Ball Finding Neverland Stay Stranger Than Fiction The Kite Runner and Quantum of Solace? Theyre also his. When Gerry and a wounded Israeli soldier (Daniella Kertesz) make their way to a World Health Organization laboratory in Wales World War Z gives us its one good sequence. Its just three characters traveling from one wing of the complex to the zombie-infested other side. But everythings at stake in the trip. Someone involved with the movie understands this enough to banish the chaos and raise the tension. For the first time in about 80 minutes youre getting what you need in a zombie movie intimacy suspense and a goal. We even get the bonus of fine actors (Peter Capaldi Pierfrancesco Favino Ruth Negga and Moritz Bleibtreu) supporting Pitt who to his immense credit refuses to become the game avatar -- the zombie really -- he almost has the right to become. This is a film with three credited writers -- Matthew Michael Carnahan Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof who is the alleged author of this passage. That climactic sequence is so well done that you resent the rest of the movie for its incompetence and incoherence. But when the illegible Post-it note of a finale arrives a scene later with its threat of a sequel its as if the entire production is laughing at us. WWZ 2? Not if were lucky.

"World War Z - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire World War Z Posted by Christy Lemire on June 21 2013 5 Comments Paramount Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense frightening zombie sequences violence and disturbing images. Running time 115 minutes. Three stars out of four. Walking out of ""World War Z"" I realized I probably havent felt this edgy and paranoid after a movie since ... ""Aliens"" maybe? And that was when I was an impressionable teenager in the San Fernando Valley way back in 1986. The reports are well-known by now about how the production was plagued by extensive rewrites and weeks of re-shoots _ including an entirely different ending _ which sent the blockbusters budget skyrocketing well beyond the 200-million mark. Whatever changes director Marc Forster made with a writing team that includes Damon Lindelof (""Lost"") Drew Goddard (""The Cabin in the Woods"") and who knows how many others they seem to have been the right ones. As a viewer youd never know there was turmoil; the switches are seamless. As both thrilling spectacle and escapist summer entertainment ""World War Z"" is enormously effective with Brad Pitt at the center hopscotching the globe in search of the origin of a zombie apocalypse. A pandemic is quickly spreading worldwide turning terrified humans into ravenous predators 12 seconds after theyre exposed and leveling major cities in no time. Its powerful in its propulsive energy in both the sense of panic it creates off the top and the quieter creeping feeling of dread that permeates the final act. I must admit I havent read the Max Brooks book that the film is based on but I understand from friends who have that the tweaks in voice and narrative structure still result in a blast of a film. ""World War Z"" startles you just as much in what it doesnt show as what it does; this is a PG-13 zombie flick after all so its low on the gore. But the repercussions of this fight for survival are clear and inescapable often lurking just outside the frame. The visuals are never short of impressive and often are dazzlingly disturbing; the action is worlds more inspired than Forsters James Bond film ""Quantum of Solace."" These arent shuffling lumbering zombies but convulsing flailing ravenous freaks. Individually theyre shocking in their spastic unpredictability; en masse they are a menacing swarm working together in a frenzy to create fear. Theres obviously a great deal of CGI at work here in the larger attacks on entire cities but one scene in particular in Jerusalem in which the zombies instinctively use each other as a ladder to scramble over a giant wall thats (supposedly) a fool-proof means of keeping them out is especially spectacular. (Three words exploding zombie helicopter.) ""World War Z"" is however a tad low on the character development. More than a tad actually and the fact that we dont get to know these people very well keeps us from becoming deeply moved by their peril. Pitt as former United Nations field investigator Gerry Lane accomplishes a lot rather efficiently in conveying authority in establishing a calming feeling in a sea of chaos and carnage. This is not one of his showier or sexier roles by any means but he gets the job done often through the sheer power of his magnetic presence. But if you take a step back and actually you know think you realize hes functioning in the cliched position of being pulled out of retirement for that tried-and-true one last job. Pitt (who also serves as a producer on the film) also has some lovely intimate scenes with Mireille Enos who gives a natural stand-out performance as his wife and the mother of the couples two daughters. Watching them together is also a bit frustrating though because you know Enos is capable of even more nuance more humanity if only shed been given the chance. Similarly strong character actors including James Badge Dale and David Morse appear in roles that are brief but so memorable they leave you longing for more. Only Daniella Kertesz as a young Israeli soldier who starts out as Gerrys protector but becomes a crucial figure in his plan is afforded the opportunity to show what she can really do. Even Brad Pitt can use a little help every now and then. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Brad Pitt Marc Forster thriller zombies 5 Comments on ""World War Z"" September 9 2013  by  Ed     _since Alien(s)? really? You cannot remotely place the first/second Alien masterpieces on any scale that equates to WWZ. WWZ is nothing more than another militarized hollywood mish-mash of pointless cut-scenes shallow characters and weak plot. If Pitt as a character was intending to bring this flic to another level then he never made up the first few steps. He just gave up as a character playing incessant unwilling participant - just loses steam after the first 10 minutes. Zombi CGI was nice Ill give it that but as far as suspense and thrills doesnt add up for the amount of money and writers that were dumped on this release. If you havent seen ""I am Legend"" you will be impressed and surprised by your WWZ review. Reply September 17 2013  by  JozieLee     WWZ hit the DVD shelves today so we bought the Pay-Per-View release. Gotta say Im not into zombie or vampire or masked killer flix but WWZ put me at ease and allowed me to enjoy a well told story and I believe it was because of the lack of gore. Call me a wuss but scarey movies really frighten me. For me the lack of character development didnt matter. I looked at the story as a commentary about how we as humans are interlinked and why we need to take care of each other. I liked the reluctant hero paying attention . . . like noticing how long before the first human he saw turn into a zombie - 12 seconds how he noticed the difference in their reactions zombie vs human and how the scientist helped him to ""see"" the resolution. So many fascinating moments. WWZ and Brad Pitt took me on a journey that thrilled and excited me. QUANTUM OF SOLACE. I loved that movie too primarily for the chase scenes like the opening scene where 007 chases the smuggler; fights/kills the double agent in the bodego changes into his clothes then meets the girl who takes him on another chase in her VW; and of course the boat chase with the corrupt politician. This guy never stops. More more. Reply September 28 2013  by  mary alice wilson     I watched it on Amazon last night (all the way thru in one sitting but was glad they gave me 48 hours if needed) and would rank it as an 85 or more. This mornings newspaper reported a 625K grant to Wright State University to continue on their project of being able to tell when a new flu strain comes into an airport. Like a new bird flu mutation. Considered it extremely apropos and timely. Reply October 1 2013  by  jrsamu     Ditto on the pleasure of seeing a thriller in this genre without the proverbial bloodbath. Didnt need it. Had pretty low expectations going in but was pleasantly surprised. For me it was also very intense. Let me judge it another way - the only time in the movies that my wife squeezed my hand tighter and with more force was the original Alien in 1979. And to be fair in Alien it also included violently banging my arm against the armrest...repeatedly. Stopped holding hands in scary movies for awhile. I agree that WWZ does not stand up to the two Alien pictures (the 79 film being a top 10 of all time masterpiece IMHO) but in a pretty miserable movie summer it is one of the few that exceeded expectations and stands on its own.

The latest and biggest zombie-festation is ""World War Z"" starring Brad Pitt as a former United Nations investigator of global ""hot zones."" The action kicks in early as Pitts Gerry and his family are caught in urban gridlock that quickly morphs into zombielock.Pitt has fought to make this movie for more than six years and presumably his passion has as much to do with zombies as metaphors for eco-disaster. (Some kind of viral infection apparently started the whole mess wouldnt you know). Trouble is when you see a zombie rapidly advancing on you - and in this movie they travel in hordes - its no time to be thinking metaphorically. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Director Marc Forster is very good at amping up the terror but after a while we reach zombie overload and we might as well be watching an infestation of Transformers. Pitt conducts himself manfully throughout the proceedings - he is never less than believable while facing off against this pandemic - but if I never see another zombie in the movies I will not feel deprived.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The info maven at the Barnes amp; Noble on the 16th Street Mall was gentle yet emphatic ""Dont read the book."" She was talking about Max Brooks 2006 novel ""World War Z An Oral History of the Zombie War"" which took its inspiration from Studs Terkels ""The Good War"" a collection of interviews about WWII and ran wild with it. Like the movie for itself then like the book for what it is she advised adding ""Im going to try to forget I read the book when I see the movie."" So here we are considering ""World War Z"" -- starring Brad Pitt -- as movie not as the loose adaptation of a book that recounted an apocalyptic war through a number of survivors tales. In a season of long-winded blockbusters ""World War Z"" moves with impressive efficiency. The story of a global pandemic of undead predators infected with god-knows-what is nearly as fleet as its swarms of zombies. Yes zombies. ""Did anyone see the memo about zombies?"" asks former U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Pitt) when he lands in North Korea with a whip-smart virologist (Elyes Gabel) who refers to Mother Nature as a ""serial killer"" in one of the movies finest lines. Director Marc Forster wastes little time in plunging Lane wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters into the action. A traffic jam in Philadelphia morphs into something much worse. Soon they are on the run trying to survive until Lanes old U.N. colleague Under Secretary Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena) can extract them. Like Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather Part III"" Lanes being dragged back into a world of mayhem one he left to be a pancake-flipping stay-at-home dad. But Umutoni drafts Lane to escort the virologist. (If they can find the origin of the virus they can begin to work on a vaccine.) After a nasty bit of arm-twisting Gerry hits the skies and his destinations take us across a rabid globe. Along the way he sees things that may add up to some understanding of the catastrophe and a solution. ""World War Z"" comes to the multiplex in 2-D and 3-D. And while the 3-D isnt aggravating it seems beside the point since cinematographer Robert Richardson (""Django Unchained"") utilizes velocity and a kind of hand-held intimacy that makes us anxious. Theres an intelligent tone to this horror flick that makes it tempting to ignore the multitude of moments that defy reason. Add to that the swift chaotic attacks of the infected and the filmmakers dont leave the audience much time to nurse reservations. ""World War Z"" doesnt come close to the emotional power of Danny Boyles rattling drama ""28 Days Later"" or the cheeky comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"" two zombie faves at different ends of the spectrum yet united in a sense that losing loved ones in a zombie pandemic would be a tragedy of the first order -- because an outbreak may require we kill our loved ones or their rotten doppelganger. Theres no time for that same sort of sentiment in ""World War Z"" which treats the infected as pure other. Even a good-hearted kid doesnt get the chance to express a smidge of grief on seeing his parents zombies shot dead. One gets the sense that theres more allegorically here than meets the blood-shot glassy eye of a ""Zeke."" For instance what does it mean really that Israel is ahead of the rest of the world in dealing with the outbreak because its adept at building walls. Yet once it begins letting more and more folk in it becomes doomed? (Daniella Kertesz plays an Israeli soldier who joins Lane on his quest.) A book no doubt maneuvers its ""huhs?"" better. Here they can seem silly. Having a singular hero doesnt make the movie universal It makes it smaller. Disasters are writ-large affairs. Thats in part what makes them so galling the way they rob us of our sense of uniqueness. There are a couple of scenes where this gets underscored. One finds a group of soldiers asking about the fate of their hometowns. In the other a researcher reminds Lane hes not the only one with a family in this ongoing tragedy. As compelling as Pitt is at reflecting the worlds pain through Lanes eyes the movie treats him too often as if he truly is the only one with loved ones to lose or a world to save.

Grade B+ ""World War Z"" hits the blockbuster equivalent of a delicate balance gargantuan spectacle with a human touch. Director Marc Forster and a slew of screenwriters bring flair momentum and flashes of humor to a headlong chase film about a worldwide viral pandemic that unleashes a zombie apocalypse. Theyve loosely based their movie on Max Brooks inventive globetrotting bestseller of the same name. Forster and company mostly draw on bits that unfold in South Korea and Israel so theres a ton of material left for sequels. Indeed the possibility of a trilogy is one reason the final minutes may strike viewers as a classic case of ""too much and not enough."" Till then its prime escapism. ""World War Z"" is yet another glorified B film with A-list talent but this time you feel the A-listers gave it everything they had starting with Brad Pitt. Thats why it gets a B-plus. Pitts performance though hardly a stretch is a splendid demonstration of what a star can do especially in a film that goes around the world in 116 minutes. He establishes instant rapport with the audience and holds it as his character simultaneously endures vehicular mayhem zombie onslaughts and the feeling that all is lost. Pitts Gerry Lane once a U.N. troubleshooter now simply wants to be a family man doting on his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and his daughters Constance and Rachel (Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove). In the opening they come face to face - and almost teeth to flesh - with zombie terror in Philadelphia and Newark. Hes pressed into service with a U.S./U.N. team thats coordinating a response from a ship in the Atlantic. This stars slow-burning feelings play well over the long haul - any histrionics might have overloaded the film. He combines an easygoing alertness with an unostentatious sensitivity. And his knack for conveying practical intelligence makes Lanes deductive power seem believable while his ability to register human loss without blinking keeps the film from seeming heartless. He plays equally well with Enos Karin and Daniella Kerteszs Israeli soldier Segen who becomes his one-handed right-hand woman. Enos and Kertesz do the most with their few lines thanks to their super-emotive eye power. Lane is both running away from zombies and running toward them - hes like a storm-chaser searching for clues to a natural catastrophe. (In this film zombies are viewed as part of nature not as say an outgrowth of a nuclear calamity.) ""Movement is life"" Lane advises early on and director Forster agrees with him. He was a novice action director in his clumsy James Bond film ""Quantum of Solace."" Now he could teach more celebrated filmmakers how to deliver exposition on the go and how to delight viewers with a zig instead of a zag. He varies the tempo and scale of the big set pieces even the level of technology from cutting-edge choppers to a prop cargo plane. When roused this films zombies get in your face in a flash. They startle people with their grotesque quickness and transform their victims into undead comrades in mere seconds. But the real innovation is the way they swarm. They somehow know that their strength lies in numbers and they turn themselves into a group organism tumbling over any obstacle put in their way. In the films most striking use of 3D they keep clambering up a towering wall no matter how many get shot in the head. Theyre like a giant sprawling version of those insects crustaceans and amphibians that regenerate limbs claws and tails. Theyre also scary on a micro level. Forster and his Design team individualize their crypt-keeper faces and derive spooky aural effects from their barks and clicking teeth. This film is often refreshingly quiet. Because sound attracts these zombies several scenes play out in near silence. (In one nail-biting case an incoming cellphone call proves catastrophic.) Forsters decision to funnel the climax into a one-on-one confrontation is especially bracing for audiences sick of ""epics"" that continually inflate an already dizzying scope. Forster dares to cap that sequence with a parody of a classic soda commercial. In moments like that this film deftly mixes fright with fun. Its a zombie jamboree all right but its not a pummeling gross-out. At ""World War Z"" you really can have a Coke and a smile.

World War Z (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review World War Z (PG-13) This zombie epic starring Brad Pitt is too timid for its own good. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/20/2013 Editor rating 2 World War Z a horror-action picture about a worldwide zombie epidemic contains a number of stupendous sequences. In one a traffic jam in Philadelphia has turned roads into parking lots and people suddenly start emerging from their cars snarling and looking dead and hungry and maniacal. In another scene hordes of the undead swarm a gigantic wall built to protect Israel climbing over each other like ants until they reach the top and start jumping on the unsuspecting civilians below. And in perhaps the best set piece of the film a man aboard an airliner in mid-flight emerges from the planes rear bathroom and starts chomping on people the zombie disease spreading through coach and making its way toward first-class in a matter of seconds like a runaway fire. Such scenes make director Marc Forsters attempt to adapt Max Brooks unfilmable novel -- an oral history of mankinds war against the undead -- a fun and scary blast. But then theres the rest of the movie. Instead of cramming the books multitude of characters into a two-hour film World War Z focuses on Gerry (Brad Pitt) a retired United Nations official who must leave his wife and two daughters to help the government figure out where this rapidly spreading virus came from (and more importantly how to stop it). Instead of a giant-sized episode of The Walking Dead though World War Z plays a lot more like Steven Soderberghs Contagion which contains no zombies but features the sight of Gwyneth Paltrows face being peeled back from her skull an image far more disturbing than anything youll see in this well-made but timid picture. A lot of gore in horror movies today is purely gratuitous The recent Evil Dead remake used so much blood for example the overkill was almost comical. But things are different when the subject turns to flesh-eating zombies. The threat of unspeakable mutilation and violence -- the idea of being eaten alive -- is what makes them terrifying (the fact theyre so hard to kill is just a bonus). And World War Z because it cost a reported 200 million plays things extra-safe to make sure 12-year-olds can see it along with the grown-ups. For a story with so much death and mayhem the film is practically bloodless. In one scene a characters hand gets chopped off and the camera shies away so quickly you cant even tell whats happened until a few scenes later. The concept of a single man being able to criss-cross the globe in time to stop such a rapidly spreading virus is hokey enough but you buy it because hes Pitt who is just as good in the tender scenes with his family as he is exploring the spooky corridors of an abandoned medical facility. But World War Z repeatedly chickens out more afraid of offending viewers with delicate sensibilities than earning its budget back. There are some tremendous images in the movie but there isnt a single good fright and the last 20 minutes are so annoyingly predictable that unintentional laughs start to creep in. The filmmakers go for suspense but they condescend to the audience as if we hadnt seen all this before. And although there are some initial feints at using zombies as a metaphor for third-world issues and cultural differences the picture forgets all that stuff by the final reel. World War Z opens with an undeniable bang. But if this is the way the world ends were going out with a whimper.

By David Denby Brad Pitt battles zombies for the United Nations in a film directed by Marc Forster.   Credit Illustration by Tomer Hanuka After seeing ""World War Z"" I walked through Times Square and as I made my way to the subway I wondered why the movie--which is after all just a very expensive zombie flick--had excited and disturbed me so much. On Broadway there were no zombies in immediate sight only a happy and friendly crowd. Yet I felt a vague uneasiness at the sheer number of people milling about--a sense that they could all be transformed into something malevolent or frightened. Absurd? Mere paranoia? Maybe but who hasnt felt a tinge of paranoia while walking on crowded streets particularly streets thronged with barkers for standup comics? The movie which was directed by Marc Forster and was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan and a host of collaborators evokes the hectic density of modern life; it stirs fears of plague and anarchy and the feeling that everything is constantly accelerating. At times it has the tone and the tempo of panic. ""World War Z"" went through an enormous amount of rewriting and reshooting. Yet despite some conventional passages and a soft ending Forster and Brad Pitt who is a producer of the film as well as its star pulled the picture together. They also managed to reawaken in a large-scale movie the experience of shock something that has been superseded in recent years by digital slam and much whooshing from nowhere to nowhere. Im not an expert on horror movies but I know when my heart rate has doubled. ""World War Z"" explodes right after the opening scenes in which we see warnings that things are going awry news reports of feral animals and dead dolphins roving mobs and rioters--the usual premonitory noise that opens any disaster movie. Gerry Lane (Pitt) a retired United Nations trouble-shooter; his wife Karin (Mireille Enos); and their two young daughters driving in the family S.U.V. get stuck in traffic in downtown Philadelphia. Suddenly the street erupts motorcycle cops whizz by a garbage truck plows through the waiting cars theres an explosion up ahead and people start running terrified. The speed and the violence hit you like lightning. Then gradually in brief searing glimpses you see them human-looking creatures with disintegrating flesh and wild eyes biting and mauling people and causing general mayhem. These scenes suggest how quickly a major American city can fall into chaos. But whats causing the behavior? A viral outbreak? At first no one uses the word ""zombie""--it seems too silly. I was unnerved by the hurtling strangeness of the Philadelphia scenes and I say this as someone who has sat through such war-of-the-worlds extravaganzas as ""The Avengers"" and the new Superman movie ""Man of Steel"" without feeling so much as a tingle. ""Man of Steel"" which is more leaden than steely is an example of everything that has gone wrong with so many big-budget spectacles. The characters declaim in blustering tones; ironclad bodies bash one another to pieces; there isnt a joke or a satirical moment anywhere. The new Superman Henry Cavill bares his muscular chest; the hero is no longer a boys amiable fantasy of strength but the literal embodiment of power with the heft and the thickness of a lifetime gym bunny. When war breaks out between Krypton and Earth this physical paragon chooses our side. Manhattan (in the guise of Metropolis) gets flattened (dont worry Brooklyn is spared) yet no one you care about is in any danger. Its an exhaustingly empty and emotion-free movie a routine multi-hundred-million-dollar product. ""World War Z"" is the most gratifying action spectacle in years and one reason for its success is that Pitt doesnt play a superhero. Gerry Lane is tough and infinitely resourceful (he could reset his own broken arm if he had to) but he doesnt fly he doesnt pass through walls and in the long tradition of unpretentious movie heroes hes reluctant and terse. Early in the film the Under-Secretary-General of the U.N. (Fana Mokoena) who seems to be one of the most powerful men left alive tells Gerry that entire cities have fallen to the creatures and he is the only one who can save the planet. So Gerry sets off in search of the first victim in order to find the cause of the outbreak--whatever it is--and then a cure. As he flies around the world the audience is pulled slowly but ineluctably into the horror. At an American military post in South Korea the soldiers know exactly what theyre dealing with. They call the creatures Zekes and they would rather be shot than become one of them. The sequence is forbiddingly dark rain-soaked terror-streaked--a fleeting nightmare that recaps the pace and the charge of the Philadelphia scenes. You can admire a movie like Steven Soderberghs ""Contagion"" (2011) a realistic rendering of civil breakdown caused by a spreading pathogen but the horror-film version of disaster in ""World War Z"" stretches the senses to take in more than you may expect. Pop dynamism can tear through normal expectations when the fantastic is as precise as this. Vampirism as everyone says is about sex and violation. But what is the fascination with the hungry undead about? The origins of zombie lore in Africa and the Caribbean--voodoo witch doctors reanimated corpses--have long been appropriated by the modern media. The undead really do keep on coming; they are taking over our bookstores our movie theatres our cable channels. Every neighborhood has a zombie or two. Are they what we fear we might become if we let ourselves go--soulless vessels of pure appetite both ravaged and ravaging? Do they represent our apprehension of what hostility lies behind all those blank faces in the office at the mall across the dinner table? In George Romeros ""Night of the Living Dead"" the low-budget classic from 1968 zombies tilt from side to side as they walk slowly their arms outstretched in an almost beseeching manner. Romero recognized our desire to understand so the movie offers a mid-century sci-fi explanation a space probe to Venus has returned home poisoned by radiation that infects unburied corpses. Despite this information however the movie remains unfathomable and tragic a young girl who has been bitten attacks her mother. There was no safety anywhere. But that was just the beginning. By 2006 when Max Brooks published his novel ""World War Z"" (from which the movie is very loosely adapted) the worst has already happened the zombies have been vanquished but only after destroying a good bit of the worlds population. The survivors in an ""oral history"" recollect the past. Zombies are so frightening in part because they prey on an infinite number of victims and they dont need weapons. They arent an army that can be licked; they have no purpose except replication. In the AMC series ""The Walking Dead"" a group of human survivors band together and keep on the move clearing safe havens for themselves. In their world humans have been marginalized; the zombies have mostly taken over. The show devotes large chunks of time to the tangled emotional and sexual relations among the group but it always comes back to a vicious turkey shoot in which the women as well as the men attack dozens of the slow-moving undead sticking sharpened poles into their faces and slicing off their heads. In popular culture apparently anything can be justified by the need to survive although some viewers may feel disgust at the righteous mayhem. Many Zekes are slaughtered in ""World War Z"" but its not a turkey shoot. Gerry travels on to Israel which has successfully walled itself off from peril. Uninfected humans outside Jerusalem Palestinians among them are allowed into the city suggesting a warming belief in unity against a third force. The joyful crowd sings so loudly though that the noise attracts the Zekes. What follows is astonishing one of the rare thrilling passages of digital invention in film assaulting the wall from the outside the zombies thousands of them mount on top of one another feverishly falling and scrambling up again until they get over the top. These Zekes are certainly not slow-moving. Once in the city they race down the narrow ancient passageways like water bursting a dam all the while shrieking in agony. Thinking about the Jerusalem sequence I realized why I felt uneasy in Times Square. The zombies arent like us; they are us just degraded a little. And what the zombie media splurge may unconsciously express is not just a fear that people might become hostile but a desire to be free of the crowd--to ""decrease the surplus population."" Calling on Freud hasnt been much in vogue in recent years but asking for a consultation about the zombie obsession--why do we long for what terrifies us doctor?--might not be a bad idea.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Comments click to enlarge World War Z 3D Video Rated PG-13  115 minutes  2013 Zombie thrillers just keep coming; theres nothing you can do to stop them so the best thing is to barricade yourself inside and try to remain calm. This one distinguishes itself mainly through spectacle and its standout sequence near the beginning shows a city traffic jam slowly disintegrating into chaos as the rabid hordes approach and then burst into view. Brad Pitt stars as a former United Nations crisis manager called out of retirement to find a cure for the pandemic his assignment taking him first to Jerusalem and then to the World Health Organization headquarters in the UK. Director Marc Forster cant do much with the stale human story in which Pitt leaves his frightened wife and daughters on an aircraft carrier to await his return; the most gripping moments here are all aerial shots exploiting our most common experience of humanitarian crisis--on TV by helicopter.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 20 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jun. 20 2013 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Marc Forster Written by Matthew Carnahan Drew Goddard Damon Lindelof J. Michael Straczynski Starring Brad Pitt Mireille Enos Classification 14A Year 2013 Country USA Language English For more than 40 years blank-eyed creatures have shuffled and scrambled across our movie screens providing us with midnight movie screams and a pervasive malleable metaphor. Starting with George Romeros no-budget Night of the Living Dead in 1968 zombies have signified any number of automatic implacable drives - the folly of the Vietnam War rampant consumerism class struggle or the ""Im with Stupid"" emblem of such literary mash-ups as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies or Hamlet Z. Multimedia World War Z The official trailer REMAKE ZOMBIES Dawn of the Dead DIRECTOR Zack Snyder YEAR 2004 SCARE FACTOR Despite a chilling scene in the first 20 minutes this remake of Romeros 1978 movie of the same name never really terrifies. ZOMBIE POWERS Extreme viciousness. Twitching. WHAT MAKES A ZOMBIE? Blood-soaked hordes. Snyders film has a bigger pack of zombies than most others - enough to fill an entire mall parking lot. ZOMBIE SPEED They can run about as fast as a middle-aged man who has never smoked. HUMAN DEFENSIVE MANOEUVRE ""Shoot them in the head"" That or stand behind the shotgun-wielding cop played by Ving Rhames. ENTERTAINMENT VALUE Setting the movie in a shopping mall may have been a heavy-handed metaphor for a mindless consumer society in the original but at least it was a real idea. Here the mall is just the place where a bunch of boring waiting happens interspersed with the occasional zombie attack. gallery In pictures The evolution of the zombie movie By now ""zombie apocalypse"" scenarios has been used by everyone from the Centers for Disease Control to architecture competitions and estate planners to disaster game responses. Is there anything new to say or is another zombie movie just evidence of brainless automatism?Leave it to Brad Pitt producer and star of World War Z to try to put the zip back in zombie. Billed as the most expensive zombie movie ever World War Z arrives on the screen as a movie with a troubled reputation. The film is based on a 2006 novel by Max Brooks (the son of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft) - an ""oral history"" of a decade-long zombie war that was inspired by Studs Terkels The Good War. In adapting Brookss book to a single-hero Hollywood narrative Pitt the producer went through four writers and a number of production snafus as documented in Vanity Fair leading to a reshoot of the movies ending which ballooned the budget up from 125-million to 200-million (U.S.) delaying the original release date by six months.Hollywood precedent says those kinds of onset troubles should result in a John Carter or After Earth-sized hubristic belly-flop but heres the surprise World War Z is a perfectly decent thriller the smartest and most sober action film so far this summer and a grown-up addition to the zombie canon. For Pitt who shepherded Moneyball and The Tree of Life through similar production hell heres more proof that as a producer hes in for the long game.World War Z is no pants-wetting midnight-movie scare fest. Its rated PG-13 in the United States which means the undead rarely appear in close-up oozing fluids through head holes or dying in splatteriffic ways. Instead seen in panoramic shots they typically swarm like vermin or teem like bacteria under a microscope. Neither is World War Z a stern political allegory although the various ways the North Koreans the Israelis and the Americans cope or fail to cope with their zombie dilemmas is pointed. Rather World War Z resembles the sombre speculative fiction of Contagion or Children of Men though situated more in the family-movie comfort zone.Pitt plays Gerry Lane a United Nations inspector and fixer dragged out of early retirement and essentially blackmailed into trying to find patient zero in this zombie outbreak. Gerrys wife Karin (the excellent understated Mireille Enos of the AMC series The Killing) two daughters and a boy they pick up en route are stowed on a U.S. warship in the Atlantic. As long as Gerrys alive and helping save humanity the family is safe. When hes dead or goes offline his family is as expendable as the rest of the non-military masses. Before he disembarks Gerry leaves Karin with a satellite phone though the daily domestic check-ins sometimes in mid-zombie attack arent always timely.The strength of Marc Forsters direction is less in character and more in the films sense of scale and pacing and in those long unsettling moments of uncertainty before the convulsions of action A Philadelphia morning gridlock jam turns strange when an explosion takes place at the intersection ahead and an out-of-control tractor trailer goes barrelling through and over the other vehicles. The zombies like rabid animals or suicide bombers have no sense of self-preservation. In South Korea at an American military base they race straight into automatic-weapons fire. In Israel they scramble over each others backs to climb giant walls and throw themselves down on the screaming crowds with the fervour of cruise-ship tourists hitting the lunch buffet.All this is vividly memorable though World War Z plays it safe (no surprise given its massive budget) delivering a series of action set-pieces with little room for dramatic nuance. It might even be fair to say that apart from Gerrys decision to abandon his family in order to save them the movie avoids moral complexity like the plague. When Gerry catches a plane out of Jerusalem for the last leg of his journey to a World Health Organization centre in Wales he has picked up a wounded female Israeli soldier (Daniella Kertesz). Her presence suggests she might be an erotic temptation but no Gerry is as single-minded as a zombie in his family devotion.The movies climax (part of the rewrite from the original film) is a cat-and-mouse sequence in a lab that pays homage to Alfred Hitchcocks 50-year-old contagion thriller The Birds but the comparison isnt flattering. In The Birds the avian attacks are a manifestation of the seething tensions between the characters. In World War Z its all about Gerry with Pitt casting himself in a role consistent with his familiar superdad persona saving the world while preserving his family. Perhaps if he showed a few wayward appetites of his own the zombies onslaughts would get deeper under the skin rather than looking like a call for a super-dose of Lysol.

The opening credits are still crediting when Gerry (Brad Pitt) a U.N. troubleshooter turned stay-at-home dad gets trapped in a Philadelphia traffic jam with his attractively generic family. And no sooner are they hemmed in on all sides than a zompocalypse erupts. Its a worldwide plague but in these chaotic opening moments its impact is rendered in vividly personal unnervingly viral terms. The camera follows Gerrys gaze as his practiced eye takes in the carnage and he realizes that once bitten a victim takes barely a dozen seconds to convulse go glassy-eyed and turn into a raving gnawing alarmingly fast-moving monster whose only purpose is to find another host. That means the plague spreads exponentially in these crowded urban environs. Gerry manages to get his family out of the gridlock though and by nightfall theyve made it as far as Newark where they hole up in an apartment building to await rescue by a onetime U.N. colleague of Gerrys who thinks he may be the one guy on earth who can get to the bottom of things. By the next morning ... well no point spoiling surprises. Based on an unconventionally structured best-seller by Max Brooks (son of funnyman Mel Brooks and actress Anne Bancroft) the movie has been adapted -- to the consternation of some fans -- into a straight-ahead race-against-time flick. On the page Brooks had conceived World War Z as an oral history of the Zombie War transcribed in the journalistic style of Studs Terkel. But movie blockbusters especially the ones with budgets that have skyrocketed past 200 million require real-time urgency and the filmmakers were hoping for a trilogy. So they opted to focus their story conventionally on a central character (Pitt understated and appealing) sending him globe-hopping so he can witness swarms of zombies overwhelming vastly differing defenses in such picturesquely varied spots as Korea Israel and Russia. Those differences in national approach -- walls quarantines firepower -- are pretty much the point of the novel and as the books geopolitical concerns get subsumed by the requirements of a Hollywood blockbuster the film becomes less interesting. Happily there are cinematic compensations -- sprawling citywide action set pieces for instance that acquire a weird beauty when the camera takes a birds-eye view of infected crowds that look like swarming insects. Director Marc Forster whose botched foray into 007 territory in Quantum of Solace wasnt much of a calling card when it comes to staging big-budget action cant be faulted for the way he choreographs chaos this time. Hes come through with a sharp straightforward contagion epic that operates on an enormously grander scale than most. And hes managed to keep it rooted firmly enough in the real world that when the word ""zombie"" is first uttered midway through the film its almost jarring. The film isnt subtle about making parallels to AIDS and other pandemics and when it radically shifts gears in its final third you wont need to have read Vanity Fairs take on its troubled production history to know things were rejiggered at the last minute. Still whatever problems World War Z encountered in its making the movie has made it to theaters not dead on arrival but walking dead running dead and -- when its really working -- swarming dead.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Segen (Daniella Kertesz) left and Gerry (Brad Pitt) battle to save the world from hordes of hungry zombies in ""World War Z."" (Photo credit Jaap Buitendijk) By Ann Hornaday June 20 2013 Follow AnnHornaday World War Z movie review Surprisingly entertaining even fitfully exciting ""World War Z"" is primarily an exercise in expectation management. Forget those trailers suggesting a rock em sock em blow-it-all-up extravaganza or a Grand Guignol of cannibalistic grotesquerie by way of those titular Zs; i.e. face-eating zombies. Instead be prepared for a relatively grown-up modestly intelligent and refreshingly un-bombastic thriller that owes as much to medical tick-tocks such as ""Outbreak"" and ""Contagion"" as it does to ""28 Days Later"" and the seminal works of George Romero. Anchored by a solid lead performance by Brad Pitt who plays a happy Philadelphia househusband pulled back into his old profession of U.N. investigator when a zombie apocalypse threatens to destroy the world ""World War Z"" may not break new ground in either of the genres it straddles. But it deserves a certain amount of credit for refusing to buy into the current cinematic arms race in Biggest Loudest and Dumbest. The most memorable sequence of ""World War Z"" occurs early in the film when Gerry Lane (Pitt) his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters are caught in a maelstrom in downtown Philadelphia where a horde of blue-veined palsied wraiths makes a gruesome hash of rush-hour traffic. Soon Gerry is enlisted by a former colleague to help stop the epidemic and with a virologist and Navy SEAL team in tow he lands in South Korea where the first known zombie infestation occurred. With his dashing neck scarf and blond-highlighted hair worn just long enough to suggest rugged iconoclasm Pitt portrays Gerry as the ideal reluctant hero less a comic-book-style vanquisher of flesh-eating specters than a thoughtful proficient problem solver even when those problems can be solved only by swiftly cutting someones hand off. But dont worry Even in that wince-inducing scene the blood is kept safely off the screen. ""World War Z"" which was directed by Marc Forster from a much-worked-over script by a large team of writers doesnt traffic in the kind of gratuitous gore for which zombie flicks are known and loved. Instead the film follows the classic contours of a globe-trotting mystery throwing in occasional set pieces of terror and mayhem. One of the most impressive which projects the cheering image of Israeli Jews and Palestinians finding common cause against the teeming undead behind the separation wall in Jerusalem results in Gerrys acquiring a sister-in-arms a tough Israeli soldier named Segen played by Daniella Kertesz. (Make what you will of her unsettling resemblance to a Holocaust survivor.) Later after a sequence that might fairly be described as the Ultimate Revenge of Economy Class ""World War Z"" indulges in a rare instance of graphic ickiness albeit one from which its victim recovers in near-record time. For all the carnage and horror that ""World War Z"" entails its net effect is oddly soothing perhaps because one of the conceits of the plot is that Gerry and his confederates must work quietly so as not to attract their enemies attention. (When they fail the zombies come at them with necks outstretched clicking their teeth like menacing squirrels on the hunt for winter chestnuts.) Pitt who produced ""World War Z"" after optioning the book by Max Brooks does his best to inject a note of serious global consciousness into what can be read as both an outlandish horror fantasy and a flattering portrait of brave and handsome self-sacrifice. The result is a movie that while no classic can be credited with giving the audience something a bit more substantive than the usual disposable summer fare. For that feat alone ""World War Z"" deserves at least a gentlemans C. 1/2PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense frightening zombie sequences violence and disturbing images. 116 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Kenneth Turan reviews World War Z starring Brad Pitt. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Birds do it. Bees do it. Even educated fleas do it. And as it turns out zombies do it as well. They swarm. And when theyre done swarming they swarm all over again.That unstoppably manic movement is the most unexpected part of ""World War Z"" as well as its most memorable. But while the rest of the film directed by Marc Foster and featuring the irreplaceable charisma of Brad Pitt is zombie business as usual its fun to see this kind of familiar material done with intelligence and skill. FOR THE RECORD ""World War Z"" The review of the movie ""World War Z"" in the June 21 Calendar section misidentified one of the films editors Matt Chesse as Mark Chesse. -- Based loosely on the book by Max Brooks ""World War Z"" is in some ways less a zombie movie than the story of a global pandemic and the heroic individual (guess who) trying to stop it. Think ""Contagion"" with zombies only marginally less emotional than Steven Soderberghs icy characters.VIDEO World War Z trailer | PHOTOS World War ZThe presence of four credited writers (screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan and Drew Goddard amp; Damon Lindelof from a story by Carnahan and J. Michael Straczynski) is testament to the tangled (and much written about) production history of a film originally set to be released last year. ""World War Z"" plays a bit like a series of separate films and the juncture where the new final act was grafted onto the proceedings is unmistakable but unless you knew about the films troubled past youd never guess it existed. Against considerable odds the ability and professionalism of the cast and crew have carried the day.It doesnt hurt obviously to have a director whose eclectic resume (""Monsters Ball"" ""The Kite Runner"" ""Quantum of Solace"") bespeaks a questioning sensibility as well as a star like Pitt an involved producer whose Plan B production company bought the rights to the book in the first place.The film opens with the obligatory but mercifully brief happy family scenes where Pitts character Gerry Lane is established as a stay-at-home Philadelphia dad who doesnt seem to do anything more strenuous than make pancakes for breakfast.Then with out-of-nowhere suddenness as Gerry is stuck in traffic with wife Karen (a worried-looking Mireille Enos of ""The Killing"") and their two kids the world as we know it comes to an end in the most unnerving terrifying way. Infected twitchy zombies frantically search out the living even using their foreheads to beat against car windows all with the aim of biting their victims into the same unsavory state.PHOTOS Billion dollar box office clubSplendidly orchestrated by second-unit director and stunt coordinator Simon Crane (who had a hand in the ""Saving Private Ryan"" battle scenes) and effectively edited by Roger Barton and Mark Chesse these scenes of panic pandemonium and societal collapse are effective and remarkably plausible.The attacks have barely begun before Gerry gets a call from U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Thiery Umutoni (""Hotel Rwandas"" Fana Mokoena). It turns out that in his pre-pancake days Gerry was the international bodys top field investigator a specialist in crisis situations and if this globe-sweeping epidemic isnt a crisis nothing is.Gerry is loathe to come out of retirement (the guy really likes his pancakes) but with the help of a daring helicopter rescue he and his family are deposited on an aircraft carrier perhaps the planets only safe zone and Gerry is essentially blackmailed into accompanying a young scientist to South Korea where its thought the zombie-making began.""Mother Nature is a serial killer she wants to get caught she leaves bread crumbs she leaves clues"" the scientist memorably says. What seems like the epidemics strengths can mask a weakness.Its in Israel where the plot takes Gerry next that ""World War Zs"" visual centerpiece erupts. Roused from a dormant state by noise or so the film posits the zombies form an angry hoard that so swarms one on top of the other that they form a pyramid that allows them to surmount a protecting wall. Long shots of this CGI happening some taken from a helicopter will not soon be forgotten.PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013What transpires after this gets a bit formulaic but its good to have Pitt in the one-man-against-the-apocalypse role. Though nothing about this part is a particular challenge its satisfying to see the actor handling being an old-school Mr. Intrepid without breaking a sweat.At one point if press reports are to be believed ""World War Z"" was supposed to have a sociopolitical subtext. That is largely gone but what remains is a film smartly enough made to help us understand why so many are so fixated on the undead.In a world where we all feel more threatened than we ever have by myriad forces beyond our control from global warming to spying governments it is comforting perhaps to see the personification of these fears in creatures that also cannot be stopped.

World War Z The Zombies Are Attacking Better Call Brad Pitt at the U.N. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 20 2013 645 PM World War Z Brad Pitt takes on a seething mound of undead. By Dana Stevens Brad Pitt in World War Z Courtesy of Jaap Buitendijk/Paramount Pictures After youve seen World War Z come back and listen to our Spoiler Special Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Brad Pitt outruns a big-ass pile of very fast zombies--and near-singlehandedly thwarts a worldwide invasion by the undead--in Marc Forsters World War Z an adaptation of the 2006 novel by Max Brooks (who is also the author of the best-selling Zombie Survival Guide and in a completely un-zombie-related but fun note the son of Mel Brooks and the late Anne Bancroft). If you were a fan of Brooks book which used a Studs Terkel-style oral-history format to explore the societal breakdown such a flesh-chomping pandemic might bring in its wake you may be disappointed at this thrillers comparatively modest ambitions. Forster really doesnt aim to do much more than plonk Pitt down on a series of zombie-studded obstacle courses--set in such far-flung global locales as South Korea; Jerusalem; and Cardiff Wales--and let us watch while he hacks shoots or sometimes flat-out sprints his way through the slavering hordes to (very temporary) safety. The script by Matthew Michael Carnahan (State of Play The Kingdom) with an eleventh-hour rewrite by Losts Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof pragmatically dispenses with any lofty aspirations toward political allegory or genre satire. Ours is not to wonder what the zombie craze says about our current cultural or political moment; ours is but to watch in awe as the Holy Citys walls are breached by a writhing seemingly sentient mass composed of hundreds of soulless yet still somehow mobile human bodies. Advertisement Its this use of zombies as a kind of sculptural material that will likely be World War Z s main contribution to the form. In scene after scene but most spectacularly in the big Jerusalem set piece they pour down city streets like flooding rivers and scramble over seething mounds of their undead brethren. The effect--digitally produced I hope or those better have been some well-compensated extras--is chilling not least because the zombie masses often seen from above in birds-eye view sometimes move in ways that suggest an insect colony or a horde of rodents. Forsters action scenes are workmanlike (though to his credit not incoherent at least not as compared with those in his unsatisfying Bond entry Quantum of Solace). But the undulating-mass-of-zombies image is this movies ace in the hole the reliably jolting vision it returns to whenever things start to feel a little thin in the story department. That happens fairly early on as Pitts Gerry Lane a retired U.N. disaster specialist is driving his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and two daughters (Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove) through downtown Philadelphia one ordinary school morning. Within minutes their commute has become a Dante-esque scene of horror with cars jack-knifing everywhere as one driver after another is attacked and infected by packs of flesh-eating zombies so invincible they can break through car windshields with their heads. (In this movies version of zombie science the infected start to ""turn"" after only about 12 seconds making for a couple of tense scenes structured around suspenseful countdowns.) Because of Gerrys bigwig status at the U.N. he and his family along with an orphaned boy they pick up along the way are eventually evacuated to a quarantined aircraft carrier. There Gerrys former boss (Fana Mokoema) half-guilt-trips half-strong-arms him into leading a mission to South Korea to find the patient zero of this global pandemic. What he and his team discover there will lead them to Jerusalem and eventually to a World Health Organization facility in Wales where a secure vault full of the worlds most dangerous pathogens may hold a clue to halting the zombie onslaught. But only if Jerry and his crew--by now pretty much reduced to the W.H.O. personnel and one fearless female Israeli soldier (the stone-faced scene-stealing Danielle Kertesz)--can successfully make their way to the vault through a final milling mass of zombies. Its in the closing scenes that World War Zs rocky production history begins to show through around the edges (the 200-plus-million-dollar-budgeted film was set to be released last December but was held back for recuts rewrites and the shooting of additional material). A jumbled coda alludes to a series of zombie-human skirmishes as we briefly glimpse first Rome then Moscow abandoned to the undead hordes. Its clear that these are fragments of a larger story thats been trimmed for the sake of expediency but given how efficiently World War Z has delivered jolts and screams over the course of its sleek 116-minute running time its easy to forgive this rushed and slightly muted finale. Not every blockbuster needs to ratchet up the scale of world destruction and the soundtrack volume scene by scene; sometimes its just as scary to lock a few people in a deserted lab with some hungry zombies. Im not sure if its a casualty of the recuts or of tent-pole-Hollywood sexism that poor Mireille Enos stuck with three kids in a crowded bunkhouse on that aircraft carrier gets so little to do besides hit redial on her heroic husbands cellphone number and weep quietly (Though its worth noting that Enos also smiles more in a two-hour movie about the zombie apocalypse than she did during an entire season as the glum Nicorette-chomping lead of AMCs The Killing.) Brad Pitt for his part has perfected the soulful thousand-yard stare of the thinking action hero. Theres a significant element of infantile fantasy in Pitts role as the only person on earth capable of reasoning his way out of the zombie crisis (or it seems of forming a working scientific hypothesis). Pitt has said that he made the PG-13-rated World War Z (which for all its high body count is relatively gore-free) in part so he could have a fun summer movie to take his children to. If Maddox Pax Zahara Shiloh Knox and Vivienne get too spooked by the writhing zombie hordes at least theyll sleep safe in the knowledge that they live with the guy who can save the world.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated June 22 2013 1000 a.m. ET Saving the world is a challenge under the best of circumstances. Saving it from zombies is especially demanding so you would hope a potential savior had a carefully worked out plan. Thats not the case in ""World War Z."" Brad Pitts Gerry Lane a family man who used to be some sort of in-country operative for the United Nations wings it with blithe reliance on chance encounters cryptic tips and his own hunches. As zombie hordes engulf humanity Gerry flits from South Korea to Israel to England in search of a biological fix for the undead infection and finally picks a pathogen pretty much at random. But what do you know the darned bug works and so does the movie against heavy odds. Its no secret that the production was plagued by problems went wildly over budget and was held back from last years scheduled release so that a new ending could be devised. The ending turns out to be as weak as the logic of the plot that precedes it. Gerry gets reunited with his family but zombies are still bad business so all we can do is help each other hope our species pulls through and keep our eyes peeled for a sequel. Any suggestion of ""World War Z"" as the opening salvo of a franchise is dubious at best. Yet this enjoyable shambles of a sci-fi thriller directed by Marc Forster in impressive 3-D stands on its own as a powerful vision of planetary chaos. WSJ film critic Joe Morgenstern says Brad Pitt saves this thriller from being just another zombie flick. Watch a clip from the film ""World War Z."" United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) traverses the world to stop the Zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments and threatening to destroy humanity itself. (Photo/Video Paramount) No time is wasted on an extended tease. Gerry and his wife (played appealingly by Mireille Enos) serve breakfast pancakes to their two daughters in Philadelphia head out for a family drive and then whammo all hell breaks loose. Whats going on? We know they dont; road rage was never like this. Street-level savagery in the city of brotherly love gives way to breathtaking aerial shots of the surging swarms Its as if some vast metastasis were being tracked by Google Earth. Before anyone can say zombie--the word first turns up in an email from South Korea--crazed chompers have invaded cities around the world. As soon as Gerry and his family are airlifted to the temporary safety of an aircraft carrier in the Atlantic he hops a C-130 transport for a U.S. base in South Korea to see what he can find. Earlier versions of the script which was based on a novel by Max Brooks and is credited to three screenwriters had the zombie virus originating in China until the studio realized that this might lose them a huge market. Gerrys stopover in Jerusalem wont alienate Israeli moviegoers; hes there because Israel alone among nations has somehow managed to build walls to keep the zombies out. Yet its hard to believe the construction project wasnt intended as a metaphor for other walls so its catastrophic failure can be seen as political comment and will surely be seen as one of the movies most spectacular action sequences. Action is a variable in the erratic course of ""World War Z."" (When a nuclear bomb explodes in the distance during one of Gerrys flights no one ventures a comment.) Zillions of digital zombies constitute too much of a bad thing--first hordes then bores. Individual zombies come on as absurd dancing strangely spasmodic dances yet they stick to their twitches and fire up our fears. Some of the most suspenseful action grows out of a low-cost traditional trope--Gerry and a wounded female Israeli soldier named Segen ( Daniella Kertesz) evading zombies as they sneak around a World Health Organization laboratory in Wales. And happily for us humans the movies greatest asset--talk about tradition--is its star. No matter that we never get to know who Gerry is or how he knows all the things he does. Mr. Pitt grounds him in unspoken wisdom unflappable courage and unforced charm. Were lucky to have him on our side. ENLARGE A scene from Monsters University. Walt Disney Pictures/Everett Collection Monsters University Instead of grading ""Monsters University"" on a curve lets weigh it against two different sets of expectations. As a piece of summer entertainment this strenuously upbeat prequel to Pixars ""Monsters Inc."" passes with vibrant colors and will of course excel at the box office given its lineage plus Disneys marketing might. But as an offering from Pixar the studio that set the platinum standard for contemporary animated features its an awful disappointment--and one more reason to worry about Pixars future under Disney ownership. Like its predecessor the prequel is populated by an astonishing assortment of misshapen creatures (who look perfectly shapen to one another) and is mainly concerned with two of them Mike the lime-green globular little guy with one eye surmounting a big mouth that speaks in Billy Crystals voice; and Mikes gentle 800-pound cohort Sulley who is voiced and roared by John Goodman. ""Monsters Inc."" located the two in an enormous factory of the same name where battalions of monstrous workers or Scarers ventured forth through portals shaped like bedroom doors on nightly missions to frighten the worlds children. ""Monsters University"" shows how the buddies-to-be got to work there beginning with a delightful sequence in which Mike as an eager but obstreperous schoolboy visits the plant on a class trip and instantly gloms onto scaring as his lifes vocation. Cut to the campus of Monsters University where Mike matriculates as a scaring major and first meets Sulley who makes a charmingly clamorous entrance as his roommate. Far from striking up a friendship the two take a dim view of each other Sulley like everyone else is scornful of Mikes ineptitude in the scaring department. In fact both of them are plagued by their shortcomings until they start working as a team. Thats one of the lessons the movie teaches--another is dealing with failure--while its heroes confront the trials of their higher education including life in a fraternity house of misfits and outcasts and get a shot at redemption in a series of contests called the Scare Games. The screen all but explodes with visual invention and the hurtling pace occasionally slows for a gentle moment or an affecting piece of characterization. But the density of detail turns into clutter and the storytelling rhythms are relentless--its a Disney pace that uses quick cuts to merchandise excitement rather than a Pixar pace that invites discovery instead of dispensing lessons; that allows for ebb and flow for time to breathe for poetry as well as velocity. Its startling to compare the frenzied quality of this new film to the original blend of thrilling action big laughs delicate humor graphic elegance and a tender love story--Sulleys love for the little girl Boo which emerges and flowers during an exquisite sequence that lasts four minutes. Nothing lasts anywhere near that long in the sequel and theres no counterpart for the lovable child; the monsters mostly interact with robot kids in jokey simulations. Randy Newmans score has no emotional resonance; thats a first. And though many of the characters have multiple heads and eyes the movie is single-minded to the point of brainlessness in its stress on scares and scaring. This is the second Pixar production under Disneys banner. The first one ""Brave"" had many strengths but it was ultimately a conventional and frequently didactic Disney fairy tale. Now ""Monsters University"" has further diluted the Pixar brand. Its still too soon to jump to conclusions but Disney does seem to be having its corporate way with its illustrious acquisition. Thats really scary. ENLARGE Abdihakin Asgar and Pilou Asbaek Magnolia Pictures A Hijacking Heres an iffy proposition. If ""A Hijacking"" was in English or if U.S. audiences werent finicky about reading subtitles or if life was fair this brilliant thriller by the Danish filmmaker Tobias Lindholm would be playing on multiplex screens throughout the country. (For real-world playdates go to magpictures.com.) The hijacking in question is carried out by Somali pirates who board a Danish freighter in the Indian Ocean then negotiate a ransom for the vessel and its seven-man crew. Before that happens though were witness to a different sort of negotiation a commercial deal hammered out in Copenhagen by Japanese businessmen on one side and on the other the shipping companys CEO Peter ( Soren Malling who is extraordinary in the role). The deal isnt all that interesting in its own right since nothing but money is on the table yet its a fascinating introduction to a powerful executive who prides himself on his steely self-control. Watch a clip from the film ""A Hijacking."" The crew of a Danish cargo ship is hijacked by Somali pirates who proceed to engage in escalating negotiations with authorities in Copenhagen. (Photo/Video Magnolia Pictures) Danish filmmaking is much in vogue these days and deservedly so thanks to a number of television miniseries that have gained an international following. This feature film shows how much tension telling detail and sheer dramatic expertise can be squeezed into a running time of less than two hours. The hostage negotiation itself stretches over 18 weeks. During that time the freighters crewmen and most affectingly the cook Mikkel (a marvelous performance by Pilou Asbaek) suffer terribly at the hands of the pirates who have assault weapons and all the time in the world. ""Time is a Western thing"" an English terrorism consultant tells Peter. ""It means nothing to them."" Thats probably good advice judging from the tactics of Omar the Somali spokesman on board the ship. (Hes played with a chilling combination of ruthlessness and cheery sophistication by a Kenyan actor named Abdihakin Asgar.) For Omar the terms of the negotiation are rigidly prescribed hell get what he can however long it takes. For Peter however its a different story and one that almost undoes him before it transforms him. Once again theres an issue of commerce but this time the CEO also holds the fate of seven men in his hands. Its the difference between life and money. ENLARGE The cast of The Bling Ring. A24 Films The Bling Ring Sofia Coppolas ""The Bling Ring"" which goes into national distribution this week studies the stealing habits of celebrity-obsessed California kids. Their M.O. is the soul of simplicity--track the comings and goings of the rich and famous via the Internet then burglarize them for thrills when no one is home. (The filmmaker based her script on ""The Suspects Wore Louboutins"" a Vanity Fair article by Nancy Jo Sales and shot some of her sequences in the actual homes of such luminaries as Paris Hilton.) The point of the film is vacuous materialism but the way these larcenous children return the cameras impassive gaze suggests that no one is home behind their beautiful faces and dead eyes. Is this anthropology or simply entropy? Its partly the former and lots of the latter with precious little insight. The cast includes Katie Chang Emma Watson Taissa Farmiga and Israel Broussard though the movie also stars the celebrities possessions--vast piles of jewelry endless rows of clothes and shoes. For those in the ring stealing bling of such profusion is no more momentous than pilfering grains of sand from a Malibu beach.

Slideshow World War Z Pitt flees Philly to fight zombies Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about World War Z >> Um the swarms of limb-chomping zombies are kind of a fresh twist arent they? Yes World War Z - a relentless horror thriller that serves up a chilling vision of a planet in the throes of apocalypse - begins in the City of Brotherly Love. (Although for the record and for the tax breaks the Philly stuff was shot in Glasgow.) Theres a heartwarming moment first Brad Pitt busy flipping pancakes for his wife and kids the news from the TV full of cheer - beached dolphins out-of-control CO2 emissions martial law. By the time the family flees town Philly is in flames and there are roadblocks on the Ben Franklin Bridge. Cant let the zombies get to the Cherry Hill Mall. Pitt is Gerry Lane a retired United Nations troubleshooter. Mireille Enos the mopey Detective Linden from TVs rain-soaked noir The Killing is Karin Lane. The couple throw each other soulful glances and seem to have their parenting skills down too. ""Creatures in our bed"" Gerry exclaims in mock fear as his two girls Connie and Rachel (Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove) clamber atop him in the wee hours before zillions of far more menacing creatures start plaguing our hero. On the acknowledgments page of Max Brooks World War Z novel the basis for director Marc Forsters breakneck big-budget genre flick the author gives a shout-out to George A. Romero who laid down the template for the modern-day zombie movie with 1968s Night of the Living Dead. And indeed theres nothing about World War Z that we havent seen before (Danny Boyles 28 Days Later is probably the closest in tone and terror though certainly not in scale). But what World War Z does have going for it is Pitt who proves why he is an undisputed big-screen star. Even when hes being hounded by hordes of the undead this guy is cool unflappable ridiculously good-looking. Running madly - and driving and helicoptering and bicycling and jet-planing - from Philadelphia to Newark to an aircraft carrier off the Atlantic coast to Korea to Jerusalem and then fatefully to a World Health Organization lab in Wales Pitts Gerry goes looking for ""Patient Zero"" the source of this devastating pandemic. Once contaminated the human-turned-zombie throng start leading with their jaws clacking their teeth their milky dead eyes bulging like Looney Tunes demons convulsing piling on - giant antlike armies that can topple barricades scale walls bring down whole cities in the time it takes to well watch this movie. Maintaining phone contact with Karin proves difficult and by the time Gerry accompanied by a brave and bee-stung-lipped Israeli soldier (Daniella Kertesz) arrives in Cardiff things arent looking terribly promising The surviving humans have locked themselves into one wing while four score of zombie scientists have free rein of the B wing where if theres any hope at all hope lies. World War Z shows no visible signs of the production woes that have dogged the project - and supplied fodder for entertainment reporters and bloggers. Forster and his team have also mastered the discreet edit leaving a lot of the blood gore and zombie slime to the imagination. (Its still a pretty convincingly creepy affair.) And in less than two hours Enos cradling her phone and her screen daughters manages to smile more than she has in three seasons worth of The Killing. For that we must all be thankful. Maybe Karin Lane knows that when her husband says ""Im coming back"" he means it. World War Z  (Out of four stars) Directed by Marc Forster.

"World War Z | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; world-war-z ) World War Z (United States 2013) June 20 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli World War Z contains some impressive set pieces - sequences that taken on their own are either tense or visually arresting. As a whole however its a letdown with a strange mixture of epic apocalyptic material and generic zombie stuff. The episodic storyline is scattershot moving from location to location (sometimes without seeming rhyme or reason) just to keep the action mobile and the setting from becoming static. The special effects are certainly impressive but some of World War Zs biggest scenes (all of which are in the TV commercials and trailers) dont have the best payoffs. The screenplay feels like the culmination of all sorts of things being thrown against a wall to see what sticks. As it turns out theres not enough. The film opens in Philadelphia before moving to Newark NJ then to an aircraft carrier 200 miles off the Eastern seaboard. From there its a long trip to South Korea Israel and finally Cardiff. Although the film is based on Max Brooks book the movie feels like it owes more to Danny Boyles 28 Days Later. The structure is odd arguing that this might work better as a mini-series than a movie where at least until the mercifully tense final act everything seems rushed and half-done. The backstory that defines the heros motivation is undercooked and the ending is truncated. The movie doesnt end so much as it stops (with a few lines of voiceover narration to wrap things up so audiences wont feel theyve seen only Episode One of several). The film begins by establishing the home life of ex-military investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) who has a wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two young daughters. Hes driving through Center City Philadelphia when the zombie invasion hits. Then leaving the city to burn behind him he heads up I-95 to Newark NJ where he and his family are rescued by helicopters and taken to an offshore aircraft carrier. There he is offered a deal if he agrees to accompany an epidemiologist and SEAL team in search of Patient Zero his family can remain aboard the ship in safety. So after saying goodbye to Karin and his kids he climbs on a military plane bound for South Korea. That turns out to be only the first step in a three-country trek that goes to Israel and concludes in Wales at a World Health Organization installation full of zombified WHO doctors. At its best World War Z is capable of generating suspenseful stretches. Two sequences in particular - the military guys preparing to re-fuel the plane in South Korea and the mission into the zombie-infested wing of the WHO building - recall scenes from Aliens. The airplane segment is also high on the excitement scale. Unfortunately these are exceptions. Much of World War Z comes across as generic zombie/apocalypse material that replicates beats from previous films. Maybe its not possible to make a unique or surprising zombie movie considering how overexposed the category has become but I was expecting something a little more intelligent than a re-hash of other productions. World War Z violates two of my rules. The first is never to neuter R-rated material so the final release gets a PG-13 and thats exactly what happens here. Based on content this should have been an ""R"" but the needs of the studio outweigh the needs of the adult viewer so odd shot angles have been incorporated (including an overabundance of shaky hand-held shots that obscure not only gore but pretty much everything else) and most of the hacking slashing and biting occurs just off-screen. Then theres the 3-D precept use this tool only when it positively impacts the viewing experience - something routinely ignored by would-be blockbusters and this is no exception. The 3-D serves no purpose here and should have been jettisoned. World War Z isnt 3-D neutral; its 3-D negative. As Gerry Brad Pitt does a solid job providing an ""everyman"" hero who despite his military background isnt some kind of superman disguised as a mere mortal. Gerry knows how to use a gun but isnt a sharpshooter. He can hold his own in a fight but wont be sending Zod crashing through three-dozen skyscrapers. His powers of deduction are a little Sherlockian - he figures out important things with minimal information but Ill forgive World War Z for that. Its easy to root for Gerry although it would have been easier if the secondary story with his family received more than perfunctory development. Along the way he acquires a sidekick (Daniella Kertesz) but shes as forgettable as everyone else not played by Brad Pitt. World War Z still leaves me looking for the first Great Blockbuster of 2013. Its passable big budget entertainment and works as a diversion but the movie frequently substitutes impressive CGI shots of zombie swarms for storytelling. The rushed ending also leaves a bad taste. And fans of Brooks source material are going to wonder what happened. Zombie lovers will probably enjoy this but it doesnt offer much meat to anyone else. Add director Marc Forster to the list of directors who have missed the mark in developing something riveting to shake up this years roster.

WWZ-01936R Photo Jaap Buitendijk Paramount Pictures World War Z review scary zombies 1 / 5 Back to Gallery World War Z Apocalyptic zombie thriller. Starring Brad Pitt and Mireille Enos. Directed by Marc Forster. (PG-13. 116 minutes.) If you assumed zombies have gone the way of Frankenstein - as once terrifying things now domesticated through repetition and familiarity - see what you think after the first 10 minutes of ""World War Z."" This is not a funny zombie movie or a disgusting existential or romantic zombie movie. Rather it is something we havent seen in years a scary zombie movie - and not just scary but relentless. Structured as a succession of disasters ""World War Z"" is almost punishing to watch. It begins on just another busy morning in Philadelphia. Family man Brad Pitt is in a car with his wife (Mireille Enos) and two daughters and traffic is backed up. Police seem to be in a hurry and theres a nearby explosion but everything still seems manageable until they arrive a whole wave of them. Remember how zombies are slow-moving and weak and stumble around with an air of distraction about them? Not anymore. These zombies run; theyre strong and theyre so determined to bite people that they bash their heads through car windows. They leap and fly through the air. This time theyre focused. Clearly something bad has happened - were never quite sure what - but probably through a virus or an infection zombies have entered the human population. Soon its like some pyramid scheme from hell Every person who is bitten becomes a zombie who in turn bites others who then bite others. Happens quickly Considering that people at first dont even know they need to protect themselves its easy to see how something like this could rip through an entire city in hours. Like the zombies ""World War Z"" is nerve-racking and just keeps coming. Director Marc Forster (""Monsters Ball"") takes a situation that is truly horrible and by playing it straight lands it in a zone of real disturbance and unease. These things are everywhere springing from every corner breaking down doors and - though the zombie range of expression is limited - enjoying themselves. They are in the best way loathsome. The story follows Pitt as a former U.N. official who is enlisted to protect a scientist doing field research into the zombie menace. ""World War Z"" covers a lot of ground as Gerry (Pitt) improvises and goes from place to place. This means that Gerry meets lots of different people and a hallmark of the filmmaking here is that every human character is vivid. Every actor is given something interesting to play and is showcased as someone to watch. There are characters here with seven or eight lines who are delineated with more specificity than supporting roles in routine thrillers. The action isnt the perfunctory computer commotion you get in movies like ""Iron Man 3"" or even to an extent in ""Man of Steel."" Its full of unsettling images Zombies climbing up and over each other to scale a massive wall overhead views of cities in chaos and a vision of St. Marks Square in Venice after the zombie invasion. 3-D effective The choreography is thought out and the use of 3-D is at least good enough that I embarrassed myself leaping in my seat to get out of the way of a zombie that was falling on me. At the center of the movie Pitt is everything he needs to be - the face that catches your eye in a crowd believable in action human and thoughtful and as pretty as the zombies are ugly. He is an exalted but casual representative of the human race. He also knows how to listen and let the featured players have their moments. As for the meaning of it all there may be none though one has to wonder. Images of civic chaos have become a hallmark of our feature films since 9/11. At the same time zombies are more popular than ever and this is the best zombie movie in years. Does ""World War Z"" represent a collision of two modern fears - that its all falling apart and that mass surveillance a harsh economy and social media are turning human beings into interchangeable cogs in a machine - i.e. zombies? In 50 years will cyborgs be watching this movie wondering ""Whats so bad about zombies anyway?"" Stay tuned. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 448pm on Thursday Jun. 20 2013 Thursday Jun. 20 2013 Friday Jun. 21 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram There used to be two types of zombies the slug-slow variety in Night of the Living Dead and The Walking Dead; and the track-star sprinters of 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake.Now weve got a third even faster category to worry about. In World War Z the undead are as speedy as Justin Biebers Ferrari at a paparazzi convention. And they can make ladders out of themselves and propel themselves skyward. Thats just one of the twists on zombie lore that makes WWZ a fun if not particularly emotionally engaging thrill ride.Very loosely based on Max Brooks unfilmable bestselling novel which is a history book of sorts from the future about how the zombie war went down WWZ is a straightforward narrative of survival amid carnivorous chaos and a hunt to find a cure.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane a former U.N. security agent turned Philadelphia house-husband to adoring wife Karin (Mireille Enos The Killing) and their two daughters Rachel (Abigail Hargrove) and Constance (Sterling Jerins). While news of some sort of outbreak flickers on their morning TV screens everyones too busy being adorable in the Lane household to take notice.Then while the familys stuck in traffic zombies swarm like locusts hurling themselves through windshields and turning commuters into instant breakfast. Its in scenes like these when World War Z directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace) moves with a jittery heart-racing momentum. In fact the first 20 minutes are an exercise in the art of creating tension.But things slow down once the Lanes are rescued by the U.S. government and put aboard a naval vessel. Gerry is assigned to a team that must come up with a solution to what they think is a viral outbreak. As the worlds capitals go dark and civilization teeters on the brink word comes that Israel is safe having built massive walls around itself that were completed just before the first attacks. How did they know? Who else knew? And when?Gerry and a few soldiers fly to Israel and this sets the stage for the movies impressive technological centerpiece the wall-climbing zombie invasion of Jerusalem. WWZ also deserves kudos for not following the predictable action-movie pattern of getting bigger and louder as it roars toward its conclusion. In fact the climax -- set within the confines of a lab -- is downright intimate more Andromeda Strain than A Good Day To Die Hard. And theres a brief but chilling performance from David Morse who plays a man who was in North Korea at the time of the outbreak. There he had all his teeth forcibly removed which was how that country tried to stem the zombie tide -- if nobody has teeth no one can be bitten. (Now that would make a really scary movie.) Israeli actress Daniella Kertesz is also strong as a soldier trying to keep Gerry safe as things fall apart.Yet unlike the best in the zombie genre the movie doesnt tap deep into the existential dread of succumbing to mob bloodlust and the fear of the crowd. Maybe its because of Pitts star wattage (you know nothing really bad is going to happen to him). Maybe its because WWZ is PG-13 and viewers dont see zombies snacking on innards like lunch meat (the average episode of The Walking Dead is more graphic than this).More likely its because the film which reportedly had a troubled production had so many writers (five) that it sometimes feels choppy and disconnected. Matthew Fox as a soldier comes and goes before you even realize that hes there. Somewhere theres a cutting-room floor with his missing performance.Plus there are nagging questions left unanswered like why certain parts of the planet -- for instance Wales and Nova Scotia -- seem relatively unscathed from the zombie hordes. Do zombies hate cold clammy weather?Most likely it will all become clear in the sequel. Because you know that Hollywood the biggest zombie of them all wont be able to resist the taste of that.

BOTTOM LINE Culturally behind the curve but this big-budget globe-hopping zombie flick still works as solid doomsday entertainment. CAST Brad Pitt Daniella Kertesz Mireille Enos LENGTH 156 ""World War Z"" better known as ""Brad Pitts Troubled Zombie Movie"" has been the subject of many a magazine article and blog post questioning its cost overruns reshot ending and six-month delay. Originally scheduled for release last December it finally arrives in theaters today. Will ""World War Z"" produced by Pitt for a reported 200 million launch a sci-fi franchise as intended? Or will it go down as Pitts ""After Earth""? Neither seems like a just fate. ""World War Z"" based on the novel by Max Brooks is a smart entertaining zombie flick thats slightly cleverer and classier than most. It adds nothing new to the genre but what sets it apart is precisely its massive budget big-scale effects and the unmistakable feel of studio muscle. Directed with white-knuckle efficiency by James Bond alum Marc Forster (""Quantum of Solace"") and written by numerous pros whose credits range from ""Thor"" to ""Prometheus"" this is a glossy globe-hopping star-driven action thriller. With zombies. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Pitts charisma helps us buy the implausible character of Gerry Lane (invented for the film) a former United Nations investigator pressed into service when the zombie pandemic begins spreading. Thats all there is to the plot but ""World War Z"" has great fun explaining how different countries tackled the zombie problem. India went down hard while North Korea pre-emptively yanked everyones teeth (""social engineering"" says an impressed CIA agent). As for Israel that wall doesnt seem so controversial now. Pitts main co-stars are a weepy Mireille Enos as the wife Gerry longs to return to an intriguing Daniella Kertesz as an Israeli soldier who joins his quest and of course several million zombies. They move with impressive vigor and their niftiest trick is to climb atop each other in antlike mountains. But theyre also a rather gore-free bunch. The films PG-13 rating may help sell tickets but theres something disappointing about a zombie movie that wont show you the crowbar trapped in the skull. Still ""World War Z"" is darn good popcorn fare. That may come as a disappointment to Pitt who seemed to have higher hopes and grander ambitions. For the rest of us itll do just fine. 226 EntertainmentWorld War Z trailer PLOT During a zombie pandemic a United Nations worker travels the globe looking for a cure. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (violence language sexuality and drug use) CAST Brad Pitt Daniella Kertesz Mireille Enos LENGTH 156 BOTTOM LINE Culturally behind the curve but this big-budget globe-hopping zombie flick still works as solid doomsday entertainment.

Delayed pulled from the release schedule last fall for reshoots the Brad Pitt zombie movie has been branded with the phrase ""troubled production."" All part of the plan Forster jokes ""Sometimes its not a bad thing for people to walk in with low expectations."" Forster the German-Swiss filmmaker who directed Monsters Ball Quantum of Solace and Stranger han Fiction had a good reason for the release delay ""We changed the ending. The original ending was like a lot of blockbusters a big fight with lots of explosions -- a final battle. ""I said Look I think weve already had a big battle. It would work much better with something quieter. I wanted something more like a haunted-house type of storytelling ending. So we went for something very different more intense I think. I think that will set us apart among the big summer movies."" Forster says he searches for projects with a message. advertisement | advertise on newsday "" World War Z has a lot to say on a sociopolitical level. The geopolitical backdrop gives it substance. Its more academic than your typical end-of-the-world horror film. Zombies have always been a great metaphor for other things -- trends in society outcasts.

"World War Z shows Brad Pitt still has bite review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWorld War Z shows Brad Pitt still has bite reviewThe undeniably magnetic Brad Pitt sprints over plot holes in World War Z that would sink a lesser actor. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 20 2013World War ZStarring Brad Pitt Mireille Enos Fana Mokoena and Daniella Kertesz. Directed by Marc Forster. 116 minutes. Opens June 21 at major theatres. 14AZombie thriller World War Z bites back on the theory that movie stars no longer matter.The undeniably magnetic Brad Pitt sprints over plot holes that would sink a lesser actor. He almost single-handedly saves a picture that appeared doomed from months of rewrites reshoots and other vexations.Article Continued BelowAt a time when blockbuster movies no longer require A-list talent -- quick can you name the lead actor of current box-office champ Man of Steel? -- Pitt demonstrates why hes still worthy of marquee designation.His combination of macho heroics and regular-guy empathy raises pulses and inspires rooting interest in a story that is otherwise filled with howlers and not just the undead kind. Pitts resourceful Gerry Lane somehow manages to find clear highways when all others are clogged with fleeing humans. He travels to zombie zones to acquire info that a simple telephone call or email could have supplied. He makes connections and deductions that would leave Sherlock Holmes scratching his head.But he keeps moving -- his battled-tested motto is ""movement is life"" -- and he carries us with him. The zombies seem to abide by the same dictum since they sprint climb and leap like undead Olympic athletes. Pitt gets strong support from relative unknowns who make his star shine even brighter Texas actress Mireille Enos as Lanes determined wife and mother of their two young daughters; South African actor Fana Mokoena as Lanes take-charge United Nations boss; Dutch filmmaker Ludi Boeken as a clued-in Mossad agent; and Israeli actress Daniella Kertesz as an impromptu military ally.World War Z also points up the differences between storytelling on the screen and page. Director Marc Forsters adaptation of the 2006 bestseller by Max Brooks retains the global zombie pandemic angle but dispenses with the past-tense multiple voices of the source novel a dramatic device that helped make the book more than just another zombie yarn. Much of the books astute political and social commentary is similarly stripped out and theres only fleeting reference to major occurrences as the zombie horror spreads (""D.C. has gone dark""). An atomic blast glimpsed from an airline window is never explained or referred to again.The reductionism is understandable though because youd need a TV miniseries to get everything in.Forster and his army of screenwriters (including Lost scribe Damon Lindelof) depict the ""Great Panic"" of worldwide zombie infestation entirely through the weary eyes of Pitts Lane an ace UN investigator who thought hed retired from a life of scouring international hotspots.Lanes one-man quest to save the planet gets ludicrous at times especially when he possessing only first aid medical skills starts lecturing trained virologists about how the zombie plague spreads.This likely wont matter to moviegoers hungry for the thrills that World War Z amply provides which include a harrowing up-close moment that will remind you of a certain Chianti-sipping doctor.The film simply bypasses the brain offering first-rate set pieces of the mounting zombie terror from the jammed streets of Philadelphia to a besieged Jerusalem to a threatened airliner the speedy ""Zekes"" are just one step behind our hero and always threatening to catch up with him.A third act set inside a World Health Organization lab in Cardiff Wales has been understandably described as a tacked-on finale since it was reportedly shot and added at great expense after early testing found the film wanting.Yet it actually works providing a welcome change of pace by exchanging skin-crawling suspense for the earlier break-neck action.The whole movie seems in many ways like a fortunate accident. But theres no doubting the deliberate wisdom of making a star of Pitts talent and stature the lead.Read more about Brad PittThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Back in the early 80s George Romero--the lord of the undead the godfather of walking-corpse cinema--dared to dream big. Early drafts of Day Of The Dead the third and then-final chapter of his Dead franchise promised a bona fide horror epic complete with a sprawling cast of characters and an opening act set in a city overrun with flesh-eaters. There was just one roadblock In order to secure the funds necessary to mount such an ambitious opus Romero would have to tone down the violence at least enough to score an ""R"" rating from the MPAA. Given the choice between a healthy budget and buckets of gore the director predictably opted for the latter jettisoning the more expensive elements of his story. The resulting film is a milestone--maybe the bleakest and most graphic gut-muncher of them all--but epic it most certainly is not. For a taste of what Romero may have originally envisioned but splashed across a much larger canvas look to the propulsive hell-on-Earth blockbuster World War Z. In terms of pure scope theres never been a zombie movie like this one. Made for close to 200 million the film spans several continents flooding the streets of major cities with hundreds maybe even thousands of extras and giving audiences a taste of the mass chaos and hysteria movies like this normally skip past. The wow factor arrives early with a Philadelphia traffic jam that escalates into a full-blown mob scene. As retired UN operative Brad Pitt attempts to navigate his family out of the outbreak zone the camera pulls back and up and the panoramic view--of bodies in fevered motion of the dead in hot pursuit of the living--is pretty stunning. But all that pricey mayhem comes with a different kind of price the kind Romero simply wasnt willing to pay. Saddled with a PG-13 rating--because no studio that spends this much bank is going to risk losing the business of cash-flush teenagers--World War Z is not just the biggest but also one of the tamest zombie movies ever made. Yes plenty of great horror films have relied on suggestion instead of Grand Guignol gruesomeness but how many of them featured scenes of mass slaughter of armies of the undead chasing down teeming screaming crowds of civilians? Like The Hunger Games which made a televised death-tournament safe for all ages WWZ is skittish to an aesthetic fault. For all its shock-and-awe enormity the Philly sequence is also borderline incoherent masking bloodshed with frenetic editing. What viewers cant visually process wont hurt them. Based on Max Brooks bestselling novel World War Z bears only a passing resemblance to its source material. Granted a true adaptation of that book-- which is a sort of oral history of the zombie apocalypse told exclusively through first-person accounts--would require the hours and hours of running time only television can provide. Here the screenwriters who include the much-maligned Damon Lindelof (Lost Prometheus) and Cabin In The Woods director Drew Goddard twist Brooks fictional multi-perspective dossier into a linear heros journey. After getting his loved ones to safety--and being told by Fana Mokoenas bigwig that their continued sanctuary depends on his cooperation--Pitt ventures out into a besieged world searching for answers about the spread of the plague. His travels which take him from a rainy ravaged Korea to a walled-off Israel and beyond are really just the catalyst for a series of run-and-gun setpieces. Peaking with a nightmare at 20000 feet World War Z bucks the current trend in summer blockbusters by feeling weirdly understuffed. Its an episodic adventure without enough episodes. Defaulting to empty-vessel superstar mode Pitt is purely functional in the lead; theres about as much life in his eyes as in those of the rampaging monsters he outruns. The actors workmanlike performance is in keeping with the hired-gun execution of director Marc Forster whose only relevant experience for this job was making the lousy James Bond film between Casino Royale and Skyfall. Some of the mayhem is capably staged--see again the mile-high massacre--but Forster never generates the kind of doomsday dread common to even a mediocre episode of The Walking Dead. Part of that is the films tunnel vision After the first act the madness in the streets is largely unseen; while characters talk of whole cities ""going dark"" Forster keeps the focus glued on Pitt. As in Steven Soderberghs Contagion--a much better film about a global epidemic and the efforts to contain it--the sheer enormity of the event gets lost. So too does much of the political subtext of Brooks novel reduced here to a few lines of dialogue uttered between action sequences. One of the biggest deviations from the text is the nature of the ghouls themselves which Brooks described as basically identical to the standard eating-machine Romero variety. By now running zombies have become as common as shuffling ones but these are a different beast entirely. Moving in frantic swarms and even piling on top of each other to scale walls Forsters dead behave like the cells of a hostile virus. (They arent even carnivores really as biting is just a strategy to spread the disease.) That said they do share one quality with Romeros living dead a secret gift for slapstick comedy. Some much-needed humor bolsters the films most playful and suspenseful passage a nerve-wracking stealth operation through infested territory. And then World War Z having apparently run out of money just kind of trails off. Whats the point in trading carnage for cash if the latter cant buy a proper ending or much of an ending at all? When it comes to zombie movies maybe Romero had it right Smaller and grislier is better.

He cooks up homey pancakes every morning for his family. He travels the world doing selfless necessary relief work. He takes in young needy multicultural people. There are only two differences. One I dont see Angelina Jolie anywhere. Two I see zombies absolutely everywhere. So yes there is a lot that is familiar to Pitts new horror epic. Some of that is the hunky-daddy imagery and the repair-the-world idealism which comes from the actor. And the rest is -- well everything else mostly borrowed from ""The Crazies"" and ""28 Days Later."" Its still a pretty sturdy framework for a horror movie though. Theres a ""rage virus"" which turns people into rabid monsters. Ten seconds after they bite you you turn into one too. Uh-oh here they come. Better run. What ""World War Z"" has going for it -- besides the lazy brunch-in-pajamas charm of Pitt -- is an enormous budget which lets it tell a truly global story and an unusual storytelling approach which separates the film into four distinct acts. In the first Pitt is in Philadelphia when the onslaught suddenly overruns the city. He and his family flee drive as far as some housing projects in Newark and then get airlifted out by the U.S. military. It seems they want Pitt (whose former U.N. job is a little vague) to help them find the Patient Zero whos the source of this awful outbreak. Brad Pitt races to save his family and the world in World War ZPARAMOUNT So Pitts dispatched with a genius scientist and a very tough bunch of SEALs. And off they go hopscotching first to South Korea then to Israel then to Wales -- picking up clues but losing crucial support staff along the way as city after city falls to the marauding hordes. The ambitious scope of the film is strikingly new for a zombie picture. And the zombies themselves have a fresh twist in that they have a kind of insect mentality calmly climbing on top of each other like ants to reach a goal. (These provide the films best images.) But the movie -- which went through several revisions and serious reshoots -- has a fragmentary feel with its novel multipart style eventually turning a bit jarring. Taken alone some of those parts are great. The most emotional is the first of the four as Pitt and his family are on the run; the most exotic is the third when Pitt goes to Jerusalem (actually Malta) and is chased around an ancient city by another walking-dead mob. And while the second chapter -- a dull trip to South Korea -- goes absolutely nowhere the fourth is rather smart as Pitt holes up at a Welsh outpost of the World Health Organization and starts to figure out a way to fight these things. The problem with this episodic structure is that however daring it is it ends up feeling well episodic. True the fragmentary nature was a large part of its best-seller source (which presented itself as an oral history of the zombie wars with multiple points-of-view and a strong geopolitical sense). Any honest adaptation would have to include that. Yet to make this a ""Brad Pitt movie"" the storys been rejiggered to filter varied parts through a single heros gaze. That destroys the mosaic feeling and introduces a few problems. Pitts family is brought on stage then arbitrarily pushed off. His part ends before the movies found a truly satisfying ending. Pitt is fine director Mark Forster gets some startling moments out of his creatures (mostly by keeping them offscreen at first) and the film has a few nice notes. I liked the tough female Israeli soldier Pitt teams up with in Jerusalem and the distrustful doctors he meets in Wales. The frantic scenes in the Newark housing project (also actually somewhere in the U.K.) are hold-your-breath scary. But even if you didnt know about the films many reshoots and re-edits (or see all those different writers names in the credits) youd notice the jarring shifts from act to act. Its supposed to be a zombie story. But the movie itself feels more like Frankensteins monster -- stitched together out of mismatched parts stumbling herky-jerkily into the dark. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and strong language. World War Z (PG-13) Paramount (116 min.) Directed by Marc Forster. With Brad Pitt.

What part of that sentence doesnt make you snort milk out your nose? But the surprise of the absorbing frightening ""World War Z"" is that what sounds ridiculous on paper turns out be a gripper on the screen. Despite a troubled production Marc Forster has made an epic genre entertainment that feeds on our fears of apocalypse but the movies just fast enough and smart enough -- and more importantly human enough -- to keep an audience on edge from start to finish.

Zombie plots are so overdone these days that you almost know what you are heading into when you watch one of these movies. This one was more light on the science part and focused more on the suspense piece and enough character development to make us care for Pitt and his family. Ended up pleasantly surprise by how much I enjoyed this movie. He doesnt look like a drag with that hear style btw Tony Healysaid on Thursday June 20 2013 124921 PMWow this is good news Rich.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 806 p.m. EDT June 19 2013Brad Pitts zombie thriller is entertaining but cant sidestep improbable moments.Brad Pitt and Daniella Kertesz star in the thriller World War Z.(Photo Jaap Buitendijk Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review   1/2 out of fourStars Brad Pitt Mireille Enos Daniella Kertesz James Badge Dale Ludi Boeken Matthew FoxRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 56 minutes; Opens Thursday night in select theaters Friday nationwideWhen -- and if -- one ponders the zombie apocalypse its not usually in the same thought bubble as Brad Pitt.So World War Z (  1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday night in select theaters and Friday nationwide) gets points for juxtaposing the beastly undead with the beauteous movie star. Though to Pitts credit hes playing a worried family man not a dashing Hollywood icon.Still hes a credible action hero. There are more than a few moments when he cheats death and destruction with the equanimity of Jason Bourne.World War Z begins as a tense thriller about an ordinary family seeking to survive a deadly viral outbreak. Then most of the film is focused on Pitts Gerry Lane a former United Nations investigator turned zombie hunter. Lane keeps an admirably cool head amid catastrophe. But his best moments are his most human when he gently teases his daughter or awkwardly apologizes when he hears about the tragedy a health official has faced. He nervously assumes a viral ""camouflage"" as a snarling zombie menaces him in the films most suspenseful scene. These Everyman chinks in his even-keeled armor are when Pitts performance is at its best.The movie toggles between Hollywood commercialism and a social statement about global instability. It has moments that border on profound then pull back.VIDEO Pitts son plays zombie gets shot in World War ZPREMIERE Brad Pitt unleashes Z in NYCMORE Pitt surprises fans at four Z screeningsREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarBased on Max Brooks best seller and directed by Marc Forster World War Z is actually closer in spirit to Steven Soderberghs Contagion than to Night of the Living Dead. There are palpable moments of terror but once weve seen the flesh-eating hordes up close its hard not to laugh at their goggly eyes incessant jerking and hideous gnashing teeth.Lane his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and their two young daughters begin a seemingly ordinary day amid TV news talk of a worldwide rabies outbreak. Oddly no one seems too concerned.In the car they are suddenly mired in massive gridlock. Police helicopters buzz overhead as motorcycle cops race by. Then out of nowhere the city seems to go mad. Cars and trucks are overturned. Mayhem reigns.A pandemic is spreading across the globe. Infected folks are relentlessly attacking the worlds armies and legions of unlucky civilians.Pressed into service by his former boss at the U.N. (Fana Mokoena) Lane safely transports his family onto a massive ship in the Atlantic Ocean and then heads off to find Patient Zero.But why Lane? Its never explained how a U.N. investigator with vaguely defined past duties in global hot spots would be the obvious choice to single-handedly eradicate the zombie epidemic.There are also glaring implausibilities Gerry and an Israeli soldier (Daniella Kertesz) are the sole human survivors of a midair explosion and a spectacular plane crash. They brush themselves off and walk out of the fuselage and into a medical research facility.A crucial missing element is a sense of loss. Terror reigns but as family members are violently killed no one grieves. A boy left orphaned joins Gerry and Karen without a backward glance or visible sadness.The sight of legions of zombies scaling a huge wall in Jerusalem is chilling but not nearly as disturbing as the realization that travelers are unknowingly trapped aboard a jet with bloodthirsty feral folks. Zombies are the new snakes on a plane.The ambitious architecture of a mind-blowing movie is here. But not enough energy is devoted to the more shattering philosophical questions of what happens when rules norms and structures fail and governments and armies are left defenseless.Essentially it boils down to familiar fare a well-paced entertaining conventional action thriller where a reluctant hero saves the day. 143 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 23 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/16frKmeSummer Movies Calendar JuneTake a look at the films heading to the box office this June complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

World War Z which may be the most entertaining and accomplished zombie thriller since George A. Romeros Dawn of the Dead (1979) has touches of that suspenseful high-tension claustrophobia. Yet its a very different sort of zombie feast (far more than say The Walking Dead). Its vast and sprawling and spectacular; its the first truly globalized orgy of the undead. The director Marc Forster is a filmmaker whose work Ive never particularly liked (he made the genteel Finding Neverland the overblown Monsters Ball and the Bond dud Quantum of Solace). Here though working from the 2006 Max Brooks novel World War Z An Oral History of the Zombie War he shows a new audacity and flair. World War Z is epically scaled but its not a messy noisy CGI-bogus throw-everything-at-the-audience sort of blockbuster. Its thrillingly controlled and it builds in impact. The film opens with music thats meant to remind you of Tubular Bells the chilling theme music from The Exorcist and thats followed by a collage of actual TV news snippets cleverly edited together to suggest a world already tilting toward the abyss. In Philadelphia where Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) his wife (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters (Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove) are driving from their suburban home toward the center of town were plunged into the first disquieting evidence of the zombie virus the warning signs of breakdown giant traffic jams a street-corner explosion cops whizzing by and finally a zombie -- or is it just an angry desperate civilian? -- crashing up against the windshield. When people in World War Z get bitten and turn into rabid undead freaks the conversion happens frighteningly quickly without a lot of fuss. They lie on the ground for a moment then get all twitchy as if theyre receiving an electroshock treatment and their eyes bulge up to the heavens in rage. Gerry a former U.N. investigator spends most of the film traveling around the world searching for the origins of the virus (and a possible cure) yet metaphorically speaking were already cued to see what has brought about this onslaught. World War Z is rooted in the current mood of economic panic and terrorist fear and impending chaos. It presents the zombie army as a culmination of what its going to look like if and when the bottom falls out of our society. An early scene set in South Korea where Gerry looks over the dusty remains of Patient Zero has a hushed creepiness but World War Z finds its own unique atmosphere of large-scale disorder after Gerry arrives in Jerusalem where the Israelis have erected a wall around the city to keep the zombies out. The wall doesnt work. As the zombies -- and there are thousands of them -- shimmy up the side of it in a squirmy hill of bodies that spill over the top of the edifice the action hits a raw nerve of peril a feeling that nothing can keep them out. World War Z lifts some of its verite-apocalypse mood as well as the terrifying speed with which the zombies move from Danny Boyles 28 Days Later (2003). Yet this is a much more varied and surprising movie built around a soberly commanding performance by Pitt as the family man who must leave his wife and daughters on a U.N. command ship as he hops from one trouble spot to the next. As Gerry Pitt is cool fearless tense compassionate and brutally tough (at one point he chops off the hand of a soldier to save her from going zombie). Hes feral grace under pressure. The stakes for survival keep getting raised. A zombie attack aboard an airplane has a nightmarish this is really happening intensity (though it does give the film a semi-preposterous moment when the plane starts to go down). Then Pitt arrives at a World Health Organization facility where he must brave sterile white corridors dotted with zombies to get inside a lab vault. The film lets us linger for a bit on what the zombies look like -- ones a gnashing Miles Davis clone one clicks its teeth in close-up like a demented gopher -- and the storys blend of terror and ingenuity attains an intoxicating jittery finesse. World War Z turns the prospect of the end of our world into something tumultuous and horrifying and at the same time exciting. Its scary good fun.

June 21 2013 -- 924am Video (2518)  ""Wortld WarZ"" offers thrills and chills for the frightened viewers. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Fast furious and ferocious ""World War Z"" proves theres plenty of bite left in zombie cinema. With its megastar leading man globe-spanning locations state-of-the-art special effects and stratospheric budget its the most ambitious extravagant portrayal of holocaust horror to date. On several scores its the old familiar story (mystery virus social collapse pitched battles with hideous rotting cannibal ghouls). It doesnt feel like death warmed over though. Leading man/producer Brad Pitt and director Marc Forster treat their disaster epic with sinister grandeur. Think ""Zombie Dark Thirty."" The source novel by Max Brooks applied a multicharacter oral-history approach to the material and the film makes brief nods toward that crowdsourced framework. It opens on a rapid-fire montage of heedless millions sleepwalking through their morning routines and watching TV drivel while on the sidelines Mother Nature goes about her carnivorous business. Theres something unsettling yet apt about seeing video of ""The Real Housewives of Miami"" intercut with clips of snarling hyenas. Once the screaming and stampeding starts a number of minor characters enter have a brief story arc and exit usually in pieces. There are swift almost subliminal shots of strangers gazing in disbelief at the unthinkable as the fast-moving hordes swarm like insects. The pandemonium centers on Gerry Lane (Pitt) a former U.N. troubleshooter who has greatness thrust upon him when he is sent around the world to discover the pandemics origin and seek a way to stop it. His character setup is heavy on fatherly devotion. He seems willing to risk his neck for planet Earth largely in order to keep wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters safe in military quarantine. ""Daddy whats martial law?"" asks their youngest. Gerrys an inventive survivalist fashioning anti-bite armor out of thick magazines and duct tape. But when hordes of flesh-eaters pitch themselves at him teeth-first hes given to panicky improvisation. His escape route from his initial undead encounter in Philadelphia almost gets his family killed. And his response to a ravening mob of zombies on a jetliner is near-suicidal. His impulsive choices keep Gerry credible as a flawed hero and foreshadow the finale in which he takes an urgent life-or-death gamble. JAAP BUITENDIJK  Paramount Pictures Brad Pitt shown with Abigail Hargrove and Mireille Enos plays a former U.N. troubleshooter who will do anything to save his family from zombies in ""World War Z."" This was a famously troubled production with last-minute rewrites and protracted re-shoots. The seams show. Matthew Fox near the top in the cast credits appears for perhaps 5 seconds. An international team of supporting players including Peter Capaldi David Morse and Moritz Bleibtreu fares better. Morse as a renegade CIA man has a darkly funny scene explaining why surviving in North Korea is like pulling teeth. Playing a medical researcher who joins Pitt on his frequent-flyer travels Elyes Gabel makes a colorful impression and scores the films biggest grimmest laugh. Director Forster whose frenetic editing style drew sharp criticism on the James Bond film ""Quantum of Solace"" still favors hummingbird pacing over carefully constructed suspense. The score by Marco Beltrami and British rockers Muse effectively hammers home the nonstop action beats. Forster restrains his ADHD tendencies in the finale a long sequence of intimate compressed dread. He gives Pitt space to put his characters anguish on display as a single growling tooth-snapping horror awaits him on the other side of a glass wall. Switching the focus from spectacular aerial views and epic set pieces to a one-on-one confrontation in a small contained location reverses the standard blockbuster formula of ever-escalating catastrophes but its a good choice. ""World War Z"" may drag a foot during slower sections. It flirts with pretentiousness and the ending is unduly abrupt. But on the level of pure sensation injecting icy distilled fear to the nervous system its smashingly effective. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

If you dont think about its tormented production history its multiple rewrites and reshoots or a budget that purportedly reached close to 200 million what you get from Marc Forsters movie is an expertly paced action thriller in a familiar apocalyptic vein on a near-epic global scale and featuring some truly breathtaking set pieces. Yes it seems severely underexplained and oddly curtailed; indeed after two hours it pretty much just stops rather than reaching any satisfying denouement. But ""World War Z"" is a genuinely exciting thrill ride that only occasionally feels bloated or painfully dumb; and overall its a good enough summer popcorn flick that Paramount Pictures execs can go to sleep tonight without an entire bottle of Ambien.Now as to the supposed bigger questions such as whether this movie has any reason for existing in the first place whether it has anything to say and whether it adds anything remotely new to the swollen carcass of zombie cinema - I cant help you there. No wait lets back up Actually the first part of that is easy. One of the problems ""World War Z"" has faced all along is that it looks like a high-concept zombie-apocalypse movie (adapted from Max Brooks novel told as a series of first-person accounts) but its really something we dont see that often these days an old-fashioned Hollywood star picture. Brad Pitt helped produce the movie and considering its immense scale and enormous population (both live and undead) he appears on-screen a remarkable percentage of the time playing one of those indestructible super-secret-agent guys customarily portrayed by Tom Cruise.Its not such a great fit. Im not a Pitt hater by any means but he lacks the loony edge and native intensity that makes Cruise so perfect for control-freak OCD-type spook characters. Pitt always looks as if hes preoccupied by something or drifting off into his private happy place a quality that was used beautifully by Terrence Malick in ""The Tree of Life"" and Bennett Miller in ""Moneyball"" but is somewhat less desirable when youre trying to stop the human race from being devoured by zombies. It may also be that United Nations superspy Gerry Lane Pitts character here has had every possible smidgen of personality sanded away by the five credited screenwriters of ""World War Z"" (and God knows how many others behind the scenes) in the interests of ""protecting the star"" as they say in the trade. So Pitt spends a lot of the movie seeming bored and irritated that zombies have interrupted his Sunday with the family.On the other hand I really enjoyed seeing the odd feral-looking beauty Mireille Enos (of TVs ""The Killing"") as Pitts on-screen wife; I wish she had more to do in the film than hunker onboard an aircraft carrier with their kids hoping the zombies wont learn how to swim. Heres what happens in the movie Zombies attack human civilization collapses and Brad Pitt has to figure out what to do about it pretty much single-handed. No really thats it The writing team which includes the ""Lost"" duo of Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof along with Matthew Michael Carnahan (""State of Play"") and TV veteran J. Michael Straczynski has essentially aggregated bits and pieces of almost every zombie movie and epidemic thriller of recent decades. At different points in the story ""World War Z"" strongly resembles Zack Snyders ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake and Steven Soderberghs ""Contagion"" and I suppose Danny Boyle and Alex Garland should be flattered by the Vulcan mind-meld level of rip-off perpetrated upon their 2002 near-masterwork ""28 Days Later.""All those movies I just mentioned are quite likely at least a little bit better than this one but ""World War Z"" is without question the biggest thing ever done in this genre. I have gravely mixed feelings about every movie on Marc Forsters resume from ""Monsters Ball"" to ""Stranger Than Fiction"" to ""The Kite Runner"" to the 2008 Bond film ""Quantum of Solace"" but the guy is undeniably a stylistic virtuoso with a Michael Winterbottom-like ability to jump around from one genre to another. Whatever caused all the production angst on this film I dont know but you never get the feeling that Forster loses control of the images and ""World War Z"" contains several of the most effective big-canvas action sequences in recent history. You Might Also Like After an ordinary Philadelphia traffic jam turns into a zombified nightmare - like Zack Snyders zombies these are ultra-fast when hungry or motivated and like Boyles infected people those bitten convert almost immediately - Gerry and his wife and daughter fight their way to a rooftop in Newark N.J. where a U.N. black helicopter comes to extricate them. (Do Forster and the writers know theyre channeling right-wing paranoia here?) Theres a bit of clumsily handled blah-blah-blah exposition about how the presidents dead Washington is overrun and most of the worlds big cities have ""gone dark."" But who cares about that? Zombies Maybe the North Koreans have survived by pulling the teeth of everyone in the country. (This bizarre theory supplied by David Morse as a renegade CIA agent who apparently snuck in from some weirder and more interesting film.) Maybe the Israelis have survived by building a wall. HaThe Newark apartment-building siege is terrific and so is the claustrophobic shaggy-dog episode in Korea where Gerry and a young virologist visit an embattled group of U.S. Army soldiers at one possible ground zero where its apparently always night and always raining. This movies script is so disorganized that clues are scattered throughout that never amount to anything People bitten by zombies convert to zombies within 12 to 15 seconds except that the soldiers in Korea report it takes much longer up to 10 minutes or so. This discrepancy means - nothing apparently. Anyway Gerrys soon off to Israel for a visit that neatly combines 9/11 anti-Semitic paranoia (the Jews knew what was coming and were ready) with Chosen People mythology in which Israel has uniquely resisted the apocalyptic plague and now stands as a Light Unto the Nations. Its extremely strange but like the entire movie feels too haphazard to deliver any coherent political meaning. But yes the Israeli security barrier meant to keep Palestinians out also works on zombies at least until Gerry gets there and the zombies behaving increasingly like humanoid ants or termites form a sort of boiling mass and come teeming over the wall. Its a show-stopper and amid the chaos Gerry does notice something that proves key to a possible ""scientific breakthrough"" something so glaringly obvious that it took a Brad Pitt character with no medical or epidemiological training to think of it I guess.We also get a zombies-on-a-plane episode and a tense foray into the terrain of ""The Stand"" or ""The Andromeda Strain"" in a zombie-infested medical laboratory where Gerry and a buzz-cut one-handed female Israeli soldier (the terrific Daniella Kertesz) must search for the highly implausible secret MacGuffin that will fix everything. Except only kind of and not really. Its all extremely well done in the technical sense but the dramatic and moral laziness of ""World War Z"" is immense in rather the same fashion as Steven Spielbergs 2005 ""War of the Worlds"" remake. All of our worst fears have come true and the world has undergone unspeakable devastation and large-scale extermination. Civilization must be reconstructed atop the smoldering corpses of 90 percent of our neighbors. But its OK Because Brad Pitts cute daughters survived and because the ride was kind of fun.

Cast Brad Pitt David Morse James Badge Dale.Rating PG-13 for intense frightening zombie sequences violence and disturbing images. RELATED NEWS 5 best Brad Pitt movies Interview Brad Pitt By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Jun 19 2013 1140 AM What if they had a zombie apocalypse and nobody cared? ""World War Z"" isnt quite like that because we are invited to care about Brad Pitt. As for the rest of the world living dead and undead well.... Marc Forsters loose adaptation of Max Brooks novel survived production problems writer changes and delays. It does a good job of establishing how quickly the fabric of society tears in a thrilling terrifying opening scene. (If nothing else the movie hits the ground running.) But what all of that time and money couldnt provide evidently is decent character development for anyone but the man Pitt plays Gerry Lane. Gerry is a former United Nations operative no stranger to the worlds most dangerous places who quit to spend more time with his family. In the movie he spends about 20 minutes with them before hopping back in the saddle. A drive through the streets of Philadelphia turns horrific as enraged savage people start attacking other people; before you can count to 12 the victim becomes another attacker. Yep. Zombies. It takes a little while for the powers to be to buy that conclusion of course. After a suspenseful sequence in which Gerry and his family escape the clutches of the zombies they are swooped up literally by the U.N. His old boss Thierry (Fana Mokoena) tries to convince him to help the cause. Reluctant hero alert Gerry doesnt want to leave his family but hes more or less blackmailed into it by a military officer. So he heads off to South Korea where James Badge Dale has a nice bit as a tough-guy soldier and David Morse has a ball as a disgraced possibly insane CIA agent before heading for Israel. Somewhere along the line Matthew Fox has a blink-and-youll-miss-him moment. (I recognized him by his voice actually.) Lots of actors come and go few registering. Its not as if you cant tell the survivors from the zombies. Its that youre not given any particular reason to care about one group more than the other. Even as big-budget blockbusters go this is a hard movie to connect with. Then finally in the last segment things change a bit. The group is pared down to Gerry an Israeli soldier named Segen (Daniella Kertesz) and a World Health Organization doctor (Pierfrancesco Favino) named ... well in the credits hes listed only as ""W.H.O. Doctor"" which tells you a lot about how seriously the writers take the characters. This bunch must face off against a group of zombies confined to a wing of a research facility. Here we get back to the tension so nicely portrayed at the beginning of the film but on a more-personal scale. Its still Pitts show of course (he is a producer of the film) but at least the other characters make a bit of an impression. (As does Michael Jenn as a particularly hungry zombie.) About those zombies Fans of the genre will note that they are not the slow-moving ""Night of the Living Dead"" type. Instead they move at great reckless speed driven by their hunger to bite kill move on. They hurl themselves off buildings into helicopters wherever flesh and blood might be. A scene in which they scamper all over each other the pile building until they can mindlessly scale a wall in Israel is pretty swell. Not enough else is. Pitt remains a dependable star and a better actor than that implies. His Gerry obviously cares about his family. Its just the rest of us who dont and thats where ""World War Z"" falls short of what it might have been. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"World War Z movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies World War Z Fast zombies global chaos and a semi-entertaining mess  1/2 World War Z Brad Pitt stars in ""World War Z."" Brad Pitt stars in ""World War Z."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune It begins the way global epidemics have begun once or twice before in the movies with a nice American family around the kitchen table television droning in the background delivering news reports of a mutating virus. OK pass the oj Lets get on with the rest of our undead-plagued lives shall we?We shall. And we shall overcome. ""World War Z"" the messy fairly entertaining Brad Pitt zombie picture directed by Marc Forster (""Monsters Ball"" ""Quantum of Solace"") barely hangs together in story terms and Forsters direction is more about nervous traffic management than tonal certainty or action finesse. But in the key sequences pitting our man Pitt (playing a vaguely defined United Nations investigator/world saver) against some superfast and rabidly hungry swarms of unhumanity the stakes are high and the excitements there and the results as previously stated are messy but fairly entertaining. Sequels are desired clearly. The massively budgeted ""World War Z"" (production costs not including the selling part soared north of 200 million by most reports) would have to be really really popular to warrant another chapter in the zombie-wompin days and nights of Gerry Lane played by Pitt whose panic meter never exceeds 30 percent. Amazingly terrible things are happened all around him and to him all the time. Yet he soldiers on glamorously killing the already killed saving the save-able guided by his love for a good woman (Mireille Enos) their two gold-plated young daughters and an adopted-on-the-fly Newark N.J. survivor of the outbreak.The first big blowout in ""World War Z"" finds the Lanes in traffic in downtown Philadelphia (the scenes were shot in Glasgow Scotland). Suddenly zombie attack In a matter of minutes many of the worlds cities are in flames. The conceit of ""World War Z"" based very loosely on Max Brooks novel is that takes only 10 or 12 seconds for a chomped human to join the undead hordes. ""28 Days Later"" and ""28 Weeks Later"" got there first and did it better but in general its clear Fleet-footed zombies are better than slow ones. Driving a stolen camper into a trashed-out looter-friendly Newark the Lanes are rescued by UN forces and relocated to an aircraft carrier where Gerrys old boss (Fana Mokoena) monitors a rapidly disintegrating crisis. From there ""World War Z"" sends Gerry off on a series of ad hoc missions first to South Korea then to Israel then to Cardiff Wales to find the elusive origin of the zombie problem and/or concoct a cure.Forsters visual strategy is similar to that of ""Man of Steel"" director Zack Synders Keep the camera too close to everyone and everything handheld style for maximum fake realism and jiggliness. Both Forster and Snyder might benefit from being sent to directorial reeducation camp to learn the value of an extended take not designed to induce nausea. As in ""Quantum of Solace"" half the time in ""World War Z"" you dont know whos hacking whom.The simplest set-ups and payoffs save the movie from utter confusion. In Jerusalem (these scenes were shot in Malta with lots of extras and thousands more digital extras) the immensely tall concrete barriers prove no match for the scrambling zombie enemy. Later on a flight to Wales Gerry and an Israeli commando (Daniella Kertesz in the films fiercest and best performance) find themselves sitting in what appears to be first class when a zombie comes out of nowhere (well the toilet actually) to attack a flight attendant in the rear of the cabin. A better more subversive director than Forster mightve done something with this condescending set-up -- my God what is happening back there in coach? But even in his better films (""Finding Neverland"" ""Stranger Than Fiction"") Forster has betrayed not even a trace element of humor. Like it dont like it or like parts of it ""World War Z"" has no interest in splattery high spirits. It got by barely with a PG-13 rating though you sense an R-rated version just dying to bust out.The movies travails have been extensively chronicled. ""World War Z"" went into production without an ending and the rewrites and reshoots threw out much of the final third (a zombie battle in Moscow alluded to briefly in an epilogue) in favor of a new climax set in a remote World Health Organization office in Cardiff. There Gerry and his fellow survivors match wits with their undead adversaries in dark hallways and a warren of biohazardous lab facilities. Its a strangely modest climax to a globe-trotting movie. In its way it satisfies; at least ""World War Z""s laborious reshoots steered the thing away from generic scenes of mass destruction toward old-fashioned human scale zombie vanquishing problem solving. The epilogue and attendant voiceover narration that caps it? Pure desperation. But thats the movie all over inept one minute enticingly dire the next. mjphillipstribune.comWorld War Z -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense frightening zombie sequences violence and disturbing images)Running time 155Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Unrest Conflicts and War World War Z (movie) Marc Forster Human Interest Brad Pitt Top 50 superhero movies of the last 10 years Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

Ever.""World War Z"" may well be the most lethal zombie picture ever because its almost dreadful enough to kill off the whole undead oeuvre.To be fair Marc Forsters mindless action-adventure has its high points namely staggering special effects. From a towering mass of zombies besieging a wall in Jerusalem to a swarm of biters scaling a high-rise the visual set pieces are epic and inventive if all too fleeting.Although it is based on Max Brooks 2006 novel there is little hint of psychology and emotion amid the carnage. There is also a puzzling lack of blood and guts which is bad news for the legions of gore hounds who have been eagerly awaiting a creepy thrill ride worth its reported 200 million budget. Left to right Mireille Enos is Karin Lane Sterling Jerins is Constance Lane Abigail Hargrove is Rachel Lane and Brad Pitt is Gerry Lane in WORLD WAR Z from Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions in association with Hemisphere Media Capital and GK Films. Jaap Buitendijk/Paramount ( Photo credit Jaap Buitendijk ) The trouble is that if you dont have fascinating characters or squirm-inducing disembowelment the zombie tropes (aim for the head dont make noise etc.) get old fast even with the 3-D gambit. In this case the ""Z"" in the title may also stand for ""zzzzzzz"" the sound many in the audience will be making by the final frame.As has been widely noted this long-awaited blockbuster was rewritten and reshot by committee which may have contributed to its formulaic sensibility. Even for those of us who will always adore Brad Pitt its hard to keep rooting for a big bloated hulk of a movie that lumbers like a reanimated corpse lurching forward without any real idea of where it wants to go.Advertisement Pitt sporting one of the few haircuts he cant quite pull off stars as Gerry Lane a U.N. investigator who must travel around the globe searching for clues to solve a pandemic some are calling the ""zombie flu."" Its the predictable globe-trotting race against time to find the patient zero scenario; sadly its been done better before.The brain-munchers are lightning-fast and rabid instead of the old-school shambling corpse patrols of George Romero but even that has been seen before (""28 Days Later""). Indeed its ironic but one of the reasons ""Z"" is so intensely disappointing is that the bar has been raised extremely high on flesh-eating fiends in recent years. Clunky dialogue cookie-cutter family-in-peril scenes and a few good scares just dont stand up in the realm now peopled by the depth and nuance of ""The Walking Dead.""When Gerry dithers over whether to leave his lovely wife (Mireille Enos) and sweet little girls (Abigail Hargrove and Sterling Jerins) on an aircraft carrier (which is one of the few safe places left) in order to save the planet it just seems like showboating. What kind of hero dithers at the end of the world? Forster (""Quantum of Solace"") seems to have forgotten that you have to care about characters in order to give a hoot when they are eviscerated. Repeatedly. For almost two hours. All over the world.Other than the CGI eye candy which is intense there is little in the way of layers and complexity to this portrait of pandemonium.If you were judging by this picture alone you would never suspect that a zombie apocalypse can also be witty (see ""Zombieland"") or nightmare-inducing (see ""Quarantine"") or politically charged (see any of the Romero movies). Indeed one of the reasons the zombie has such legs in pop culture is that it lends itself to cautionary tales that feed off our fear of contagion. While ""Z"" hints that the plague might have stemmed from environmental collapse the movie never mines that subtext effectively.Theres also a strange squeamishness to the film which avoids grisliness at all cost. Hands are lopped off and bellies impaled with almost no blood. That wouldnt matter if the film were more taut and tense but there are precious few chills. A few of the confrontations with the ghouls are downright silly (the teeth-clacking zombie in the lab evoked giggles at Tuesdays screening). One of the thrillers few suspenseful scenes involves an outbreak on an airplane in midair that reminds you of the menace so much of the movie lacks. Even the eye-popping special effects where zombies mimic the voracious hives found in nature arent enough to breathe life into ""World War Z.""Contact Karen DSouza at 408-271-3772.

You can learn a lot from Brad Pitt -- about grooming about parenting about assembling a playoff-caliber baseball team with a limited budget.Now he has another important lesson to teach us If you ever find yourself in a life-or-death struggle against a ravenous horde dont try to run away. They move quickly and can smell fear. That goes for zombies as well as movie audiences.Fans who feed on movie gossip may know that ""World War Z"" was a troubled production with a Yankee-size budget and more holes in its script than Alex Rodriguezs alibis about steroid use. But star and producer Pitt is the general manager of this enterprise and he shrewdly ripped a page from James Gunns revisionist playbook for the 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead."" Instead of slow-moving zombies the fearsome foes in this horror flick are speed demons. And theyre not afraid to lay down a sacrifice to let their teammates score.The images of zombies swarming over the landscape like fire ants are well worth the price of a ticket. And this road trip takes Pitts team to photogenic locales from Philadelphia to South Korea to Jerusalem to Wales.Pitt plays Gerry Lane a trouble-shooter for the United Nations. (Remember them? Theyll come in handy during a global pandemic.) When undead bloodsuckers sweep across the borders Lane is lured out of retirement with the promise of safety for his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and their daughters. The worried-dad theme is a recurring motif in the movie as regular-guy Gerry first fights off zombies with various blunt instruments and then stays in touch with Karin via a satellite phone one of the few modes of communication that survive the systemic breakdown.Gerrys not exactly a power hitter. A veteran like Bruce Willis might have aimed for the bleacher seats with muscle-bound showboating and a bit of humor. But ""World War Z"" based on a novel by Max Brooks and directed by Marc Forster (""Quantum of Solace"") has a relatively plausible perspective on mass catastrophe. It deserves comparisons to Steven Soderberghs brainy ""Contagion."" It does however make a questionable move in the ninth inning bunting to advance the runner instead of going for an outright victory. At the end of two hours were not even sure of the final outcome. It looks like Pitt and his production are safe; but upon further review were sending the footage to the league office where the ultimate umpire is you.What ""World War Z""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 156  Content Intense frightening zombie sequences violence and disturbing images Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

By Rex Reed  06/18/13 540pm Brad Pitt in World War Z. Zombie movies are so many light-years away from everything I care about that I faced World War Z with the kind of dread usually reserved for colonoscopies and root canals. But I am pleased to tell you that as zombie flicks go this one goes down with fewer laughs and more artistry than most. The star is Brad Pitt who also produced it so high expectations are justified. Hes an actor with intelligence skill craft integrity and a real feel for how motion pictures should look and move. So to say that World War Z has both brains and action is putting it mildly. It has serious flaws too. But they have more to do with the impossible task of morphing Max Brookss classic but episodic futuristic novel into a coherent narrative that retains the books literary style than they do with sustaining interest for nearly two hours in a zombie epic that gets critical respect and also makes money. The good news is that it succeeds on almost every level. An apocalyptic thriller its a cross between arty pandemic warnings like Steven Soderberghs tedious talky Contagion and a George Romero creature feature. As in Night of the Living Dead the world is again overrun by wandering herds of the maggot-infested glassy-eyed undead but the horror clocks in slowly interrupting the happy morning ritual of blueberry pancakes in the Philadelphia home of retired U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) his wife Karin (an excellent Mireille Enos) and their two daughters. Sifted into the morning news shows between clips of atmospheric changes and eco-terrorist threats of martial law the anchormen report disturbing warnings about a virus that is turning people into zombies in 12 countries. Outside in typical morning gridlock the Lanes meet panic head-on as cars explode and the entire population of Pennsylvania is running through the streets and crowding bridges looking for exits while monsters infected with a rabies virus smash their heads through windshields. The best way to tell a horror story with elements of hysteria is to do it in bursts of interconnected fast-moving action. As the Lanes head for New York where Gerrys old friends from the U.N. promise government aid shoppers are attacked in supermarket aisles searching for supplies and customers in gas stations are attacked while waiting for fuel. Corpses litter the roads and gun lobbies rally to blow the oozing zombies to kingdom come with an arsenal of power weapons. This movie is off and running. Mirelle Enos also stars. The Lanes get as far as Newark where they take shelter in the apartment of a family that is decimated by the invading doomsday killing machines then they score space in a helicopter heading for safe harbor on a military base in the Atlantic 200 miles from New York City. In record time the scientists searching for the origin of the virus in order to identify it and develop a vaccine recruit Gerry to head a group of Navy SEALs heading into the unknown. While his terrified family remains aboard the quarantined rescue ship at sea Gerry and his crackerjack team discover one nightmare after another. Washington D.C. is dark. The president is dead. Clues provided by a CIA agent (David Morse) now in custody for selling arms to North  Korea direct them on a global chase to Korea Jerusalem Budapest Malta and Scotland. In Israel where the Jews have decades of experience building walls one of the films most awesome and effective scenes literally detonates before your eyes as thousands of frothing foaming zombies form a human ladder scale the barriers and leap into the populace below while the ancient streets fill with a tidal wave of snarling biting people. In another vital scene Mr. Pitt hurls a hand grenade into a commercial jet where the virus has turned the passengers and crew into snarling carnivores exploding on impact over the landscape like debris. This film will undoubtedly provoke diverse reactions but nobody can say its dull. Nearing an incendiary finale close to the two-hour mark World War Z finally turns preposterous when Brad Pitt invades a World Health Organization research facility in Cardiff Wales where the pathogens needed to make a zombie vaccine are stored in a sealed-off wing of the facility that has been overtaken by the creatures. Its his task to travel through the passages full of zombies that connect the two wings avoid snapping fangs and retrieve samples of the worlds deadliest diseases bravely injecting himself with a vial of something lethal to test his theory that with the right vaccine infected victims can become invisible to zombies. Theres more but this is one movie that only works if the ending remains a secret. The hokey 3-D gimmicks (bodies falling from rooftops helicopters from reverse angles and zombies galore pouncing from every doorway) dont always pay off though the end credits for prosthetic devices zombie makeup and digital effects are still running after the audience has left the cinema. Meanwhile in an effort to soften the books doomsday cynicism the impact is compromised by a finale in which a number of nice people survive. Dont let that deter you. This is not a movie about acting but Mr. Pitt miraculously manages to survive every obstacle with heroic resolve. And no matter how many changes they made in the Max Brooks novel the nonstop action packs in the thrills. A lot has been written about how director Marc Forster was repeatedly forced to alter the original book eliminate whole sequences (including one elaborate section of the movie set in Russia) and dilute the collision of zombies and politics into a movie that would not harm international box office (it is still banned in China). But the third-act message in a film so nihilistic that it would make Friedrich Nietzsche cheer ""Be prepared for anything. Our war has just begun."" Robustly mounted magnificently photographed and bone-crunchingly terrifying World War Z towers above every other alleged summer blockbuster. Its the real deal. rreedobserver.com WORLD WAR Z Written by Matthew Michael Carnahan Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof Directed by Marc Forster Starring Brad Pitt Mireille Enos and James Badge Dale Running time 116 mins.

Photo Jaap Buitendijk ""World War Z"" began promisingly enough with a sudden zombie outbreak in Philadelphia that had me hoping my dream might finally come true At last would I see the cast of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" torn into pieces and devoured? Alas nothing that interesting or interesting at all ever happens. Directed without flair by the middling Marc Forster (""Quatum of Solace"") ""World War Z"" consists mostly of chomping zombie near-misses as Brad Pitt playing the worlds first useful UN worker flies around the globe dispatching the undead unraveling their mysteries and working out a long-term plan against the ""Zekes"" as the Navy SEALs jocularly call them. Zombies lacking repartee interesting motives or long-term strategies make inherently dull villains -- in their CGI swarms they might as well be bees or a wildfire or a reverse rock slide. Which is why most ambitious zeke flicks spice things up with some allegory or mordant wit. Not ""World War Z"" Despite an opening montage of news clips that hints at such unlikely phenomena as dolphins beaching themselves en masse an outbreak of rabies and people actually watching Piers Morgan this one has no social significance. Its just a jumped-up midnight movie that thinks ""stuff jumping out at you and making loud noises"" equals horror and ""perfect human being impervious to everything"" equals hero. Brad Pitt stars in ""World War Z"" as former UN worker Gerry Lane. (Jaap Buitendijk) Gerry Lane (Pitt) quit the UN where he used to travel the globe solving problems (the first clue that the film is sci-fi). A loving dad of two adorable girls he is driving with them and his wife (an irrelevant Mireille Enos) when the zombie apocalypse arrives. You or I would be terrified or at least surprised He reacts as calmly as if he had just chaired the commission behind the UNs anti-zombie white paper. A couple of jaunts around the globe later youll have a lot of questions but theres only ever one answer Because hes Brad Pitt. Why does he know more about epidemiology than the World Health Organization? Because hes Brad Pitt. Why is he the only one in Israel which has been surrounded by zombies for days who knows that loud noises agitate them? Because hes Brad Pitt. Why does he get to outrun the Usain Bolts of zombieland even when hes badly injured? Because hes Brad Pitt. When Gerry has a 2-foot prong of metal sticking through his guts you dont even wince. You just figure hell yank it out and close the wound with a stick of Juicy Fruit. It would be hard to locate a more boringly capable hero and worse every so often the movie stops to announce what a great dad Gerry is to pander to Pitts soccer-mom fan base. The family stuff is as meaningless and thrown-in as the Pepsi placement. An early scene in which Gerrys daughter suffers an asthma attack turns out to mean nothing; she and the others are pushed off to the side for the duration. So once you figure out the first rule of Zombie Fight Club -- nothing too bad can happen to Brad Pitt -- the movie is despite intermittent thrills rote. There are several intense chases and some dazzling trailer-bait set pieces such as one on a jet. But stapling together trailer moments does not a movie make. To the extent there is a story -- detective work so easy it could have been done on the phone -- it takes a pernicious turn when Israel alone is said to have known about the zombie apocalypse in advance. In a world where perhaps hundreds of millions believe Israel knew about 9/11 beforehand this shows poor judgment to put it mildly. The movie backtracks by saying Israel is quick with the panic button because of its history but that only makes it worse Sorry but Hitler and Munich arent to be used as cover for propagating the rancid fiction that Israel is suspiciously adept at predicting disaster in advance. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Talk show guests Read Next Talk show guests Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46924 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 19318 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18679 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

The traditionally low-budget zombie genre has been treated to a blowout 200 million blockbuster makeover. The result looks less like a horror flick and more like a thinking mans action-thriller - the Newsnight of zombie films (youll know if thats your cup of tea). The film is adapted from Max Brookss novel and Pitt stars as a UN investigator on a global mission to find patient zero in a zombie epidemic. That eye-popping budget buys some mindblowing scenes - the best are skin-crawlingly nightmarish shots of a swarm of zombies over-running a city like truckloads of ants in a garden. But 200 million should have stretched to a third act - set in a laboratory in Wales - that doesnt look like something youd watch on BBC4 in the wee hours. And by the end the pulse of World War Z is pretty weak. It begins with some sharp thrills and jolts. Director Marc Foster (Quantum of Solace) doesnt hang about. One minute Pitt (whos just quit the UN to be the hottest dad on the school run) is driving the family into the city. Then bam. The first wave of zombies hits. These scenes inspire a cold sweat. Obviously science leans against the likelihood of a zombie epidemic wiping out a chunk of humanity - but watching the anarchy here you can well believe that if something bad does happen well retreat to the Dark Ages in 15 minutes. There are shades of real-world thrillers like Contagion or Children of Men as Pitt is recalled to the UN and packed off with a viral expert to find the source of the outbreak. First stop is South Korea where we get a sense of how governments are responding. North Korea has the genius idea of pulling out peoples teeth (think about it). Israel took the threat seriously early on and put itself into quarantine. Pitt suspects they might be to blame but the truth is subtler. All this unfolds between explosions and the splatting of undead brains. Wearing an Arab scarf Pitt is totally convincing as a veteran of conflicts in Liberia and the Balkans - half bleeding heart liberal half tough guy. Whats missing is a sense of loss - the horror and grief that should be etched on the faces of the living. As for that third act youll be breaking into Shaun of the Dead giggles at the sight of Malcolm Tucker watching middle-aged men in labcoats chase Brad Pitt around the set of Casualty.

Not much we havent seen before (just watch the superior Walking Dead series on FOX) but in terms of tension and thrills it does it pretty well. Avoid the trailer as it has an aircraft carrier load of spoilers but for the most part it keeps you on the edge of your seat. A few niggles here and there though. Matthew Fox has a blink and youll miss it role that should have not ended up on the cutting room floor David Morse is massively wasted as a POW and a devastating plane crash (amazingly filmed) has us stretching the boundaries of credibility in its aftermath. Some may find the finale a touch undercooked but I liked it. Not sure what it really has to offer this genre as a whole but Pitts performance is superb his wife and kids utterly believable and overall a well acted tense thriller that is worth a 2 for 1 with a major phone company one Wednesday night.

But to actually see the chaos the panic and complete lack of crowd control depicted with the ferocious intensity that director Marc Forster (Finding Neverland; no thats not a typo) gives these sequences is unnerving; this muddled flailing survivalist epic is at its best when it goes huge capturing wave after wave of rabid chomping bodies from on high as they surge en masse through public spaces like fire ants swarming over carrion. Add in a soundtrack full of ominous droning and some Dawn of the Dead sleazy-keyboard noddling and by Romero weve got ourselves some seriously overwhelming spectacle. The decision to turn World War Zs narrative from a Studs Terkel-like patchwork of postwar recollections into a star vehicle that whisks Pitt from one infected locale to the next was undoubtedly a necessity to mount a film of this size as was the notion of never showing gory headshots amputations etc. despite the fact that we now reside in the Walking Dead splatter-TV era. (Gotta make that PG-13 rating folks.) None of that excuses the fact however that once Saint Brad is sent on his mission to help locate the source of this pandemic the movie essentially becomes little more than cool set pieces--a siege on a walled-off Israel a plane flight that gets a little bitey--jammed together and interspersed with underdeveloped family-strife scenes. We get that this fight has got to be personal as well as global but you need more than cutting to The Killings Mireille Enos mooning about on a ship to adding layers of humanity to the mix. When the movie goes from macro to micro via an extended unbearably tense third act involving a laboratory a whos who of international character actors and some deadly pathogens the reduction to a single setting/single goal feels impressively focused. Or concurrently like a great short has just been tacked on to a larger unwieldy blockbuster now desperately grasping at straws. After that the film doesnt so much end as power down rushing through montages of fighting and flaming creatures only so it can abruptly culminate in the most awkward freeze-frame in recent memory. Really? Go big or go home they say; World War Z picks the wrong choice for its slow fade-out and instead of leaving you in fear of being chomped upon as you exit the theater makes you feel enraged that youve been more than a little cheated.

They arent adorable if voracious teens like the undead kid in the ghoul-meets-girl Warm Bodies. The zombies in World War Z are a swift teeming mass a ""perfect delivery system"" for worldwide plague. They sprout on Philadelphia streets within a dozen seconds of being infected career en masse off a Newark tenement rooftop in pursuit of fresh hosts. In Jerusalem by the thousands they climb over one another like huge mad rats to scale a high wall and gnaw their virus into the refugees on the other side. Zombies -- the military calls them ""zekes"" -- have swarmed across the planet killing billions by the time ex-United Nations troubleshooter Gerry Lane gets involved. What chance does one man have to defeat a ravenous uber-Army? Well hes played by Brad Pitt. Max Brooks 2006 novel posed as an ""oral history"" of the Zombie War. Fictionalizing the interview techniques of Studs Terkel the author (the son of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft) created a global docudrama of pandemic plague government inefficiency corporate crime and human fear. Part geopolitical satire the book hopscotches among a dozen or so countries and includes more than 40 narrators offering their testimony to an unnamed U.N. employee. How could a story with so many perspectives and a corrosive view of greed under pressure become a big-budget Hollywood movie? Well the producer was Brad Pitt. (READ Allie Townsends interview with World War Z author Max Brooks) A few years before he outbid Leonardo DiCaprio for the movie rights to World War Z and chose Marc Forster (Finding Neverland Quantum of Solace) to direct it Pitt had begun trying to make a film of another ""unfilmable"" book Moneyball Michael Lewis chronicle of how Oakland As general manager Billy Beane guided his underfunded team through the 2002 season. To Lewis already romanticized take on Beane and his sabermetric savvy Pitt added a daddy-daughter subplot. Three different writers and three more directors later the star-producer-philanthropist-dreamboat (and serial father) had birthed one of the most admired and likable movies of 2011. (READ Brad Pitt as the crafty General Manager of Moneyball) Moneyball at least had a central Pitt-friendly character to play. The synoptic structure of World War Z is more like the stars Babel times about a billion. So Pitt and his never-ending platoon of screenwriters confronted a familiar Hollywood dilemma How can we take an original borderline-unique idea and change it so it resembles a bunch of other popular movies? The first writer he hired J. Michael Straczynski (Changeling Thor the sci-fi TV series Babylon 5) invented Gerry Lane a solitary hero charged with saving the world more or less on his own. Matthew Michael Carnahan (The Kingdom Lions for Lambs State of Play) fleshed out Gerrys family -- make em nice put em in peril -- and his search for the Patient Zero who might lead to the source of the zombie plague and its possible antidote. When shooting a version of the climactic all-out battle in the Brooks book proved unsatisfactory Damon Lindelof (Lost Prometheus Cowboys amp; Aliens) conceived a new climax which was rewritten by Drew Goddard (Lost Cloverfield The Cabin in the Woods). Streamlining narrative sprawl into narrative drive isnt the only challenge a would-be blockbuster faces. Aiming for a PG-13 rating deprived World War Z of the gross-out feeding scenes zombie fans love. Appeasing the huge foreign market of China meant removing references to the plague being discovered there and the governments lying about it. The ambition to make this what Forster hopefully called the first film in a trilogy implied further compromises with the source novel. Because of the third-act reshooting and other problems dissected in a recent Vanity Fair story the movies budget ballooned from 125 million to more than 200 million and its release postponed from last December to this week. (READ Lily Rothman on World War Zs rough road to release) So they spent a bundle. Doesnt matter; its not your money. Your ticket to this movie (unless you see the 3-D version) costs the same as one for a pinchpenny indie film like Much Ado About Nothing. And the movie isnt the book. Thats okay too. Brooks volume wasnt suppressed; its still available everywhere and by reading it you can imagine your own perfect movie adaptation. As for the battle scenes that ended the films rough cut I hope theyre in the inevitable DVD boxed set along with commentary from Pitt and all the off-screen participants. If not maybe Brooks could compile an oral history of the making of World War Z. (READ Lev Grossman on Why Zombies Are the New Vampires) And heres the oddest element in this tale of Hollywood fine-tuning run rampant the movie is pretty good -- the summers most urgent highest-IQ action picture. The movie hurtles authoritatively from Philly to Newark to an aircraft carrier in the Atlantic to South Korea to Israel to Wales like Richard Engel on a worldwide assignment. And on the personal side Gerrys relationship with his wife (Mireille Enos of Big Love and The Killing) and two young daughters (Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove) shows all the care and concern -- and the sensible sense of humor -- that one would like to think Pitt lavishes on his own large family. Its a smarter more organic display of affection than the daddy-love scenes in Moneyball as well an antidote to the stern father Pitt played in The Tree of Life. Then the primacy of Gerrys wife and kids is tempered when a military officer warns him ""Dont pretend your family is exempt when we talk about the end of humanity."" The good father is reminded that families around the world need the remedy he is trying to find. (READ Corlisss review of The Tree of Life) Pitt who will be 50 in December has said of prolonged movie stardom ""One thing that sucks your face kind of goes."" Not for him not yet. His face is still there and the rest of him and it all looks great. More important he exudes the intellectual rigor and emotional vigor of the engaged humane liberal -- the most photogenic approximation of the American Hero plucked into a future war from a distant age when the countrys good deeds derived not from motives of revenge or profit but from a compulsion to help those unable to help themselves. Though obviously indebted to Night of the Living Dead and the vast library of zombie literature Pitts World War Z shares more with movies about epidemics from the 1938 Yellow Jack (yellow fever) through Panic in the Streets La Jetee (and the Terry Gilliam remake 12 Monkeys) The Birds The Andromeda Strain Children of Men The Happening and Contagion. Its as much about ""Where did they come from?"" as ""When will they eat me?"" Gerry is a descendant of the disease detectives in many of those films. When he arrives on the case zombies already outnumber the surviving humans and the U.S. President is one of their victims. (Quiz a Tea Party member on his feelings about that and he might say ""Mixed."") SPOILERISH PARAGRAPH Leaving his family on the aircraft carrier he ventures into infested areas dodging zombie attacks along with a few script implausibilities such as not notifying the Israeli authorities in charge of a chattering refugee population that the creatures respond to noise and while tiptoeing through a horde of the infected hearing his cell phone ringing. (Note to wife Never call me at work) Gerry also seems to think that the way to escape zombies on a plane is by shooting a hole in its side. The final 20 minutes the part dreamed up by Lindelof does put Gerry face-to-face with the previously undifferentiated enemy (played by a sniffing growling Michael Jenn) but its a timid conclusion to the boldness of the earlier sections referencing both the old-dark-house horror cliche and the confrontational cackling of such old avant-garde stage ensembles as the Living Theater. END OF SPOILERISHNESS. For the most part though Forsters docudrama approach is brisk muscular and scary. Those zombie attacks (shot by ace cinematographer Robert Richardson) have the immediacy of otherworldly war footage or a microscopic closeup of spreading bacteria except that these germs used to be human. The movie hurtles authoritatively all over the globe introducing characters the viewer wants to know more about -- a Hispanic family a tough Army dude (James Badge Dale) a scholar on zombies (Ludi Boeken) a renegade CIA operative (David Morse) -- before it rushes off with Gerry as he finds a new area of plague or promise. Only Daniella Kertesz as an Israeli soldier Gerry brings along for the ride gets more than a minute or two of screen time. The odd triumph of the World War Z movie is that it leaves you wanting to linger in its depiction of atrocity because thats where the movies great skill and drama reside. All-out zombie war is hell but -- as long as the person sitting next to you doesnt carry the plague -- its a wonder to watch.

Brad Pitt Pierfrancesco Favino and Daniella Kertesz avoid zombies in World War Z (Jaap Buitendijk) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday June 18 2013 1145 AM Title World War Z Film Info With Brad Pitt. A UN Worker tries to stop a creepy pandemic. Director Marc Forster (155). PG-13 Violence gore. Area theaters. Opens Thursday night. You know zombies are no longer C-list monsters when they fight A-list actors like Brad Pitt. But as zombie-fied as ""World War Z"" may be it is no summer thriller. Its an anemic actioner that fosters excitement like dead limbs as it lumbers toward a conclusion. At least there is an early creeping sense of dread as a mysterious epidemic quickly manifests itself causing a dangerous multi-car pileup in Philadelphia that threatens Gerry Lane (Pitt) and his family. They take refuge in an apartment complex where Lane a former UN investigator hears from his former boss about similar scenes of terror worldwide. As panic breaks out -- and governments power grids and economies topple -- Lane gets his wife (Mireille Enos) and kids on a battleship that the UN has commandeered. Hes spurred into service to find what strange form of rabies is turning people into pasty unthinking snarling flesh-eaters. In Korea where the disease may have originated (in Max Brooks source novel it came from China) its labeled ""zombie flu."" There is of course no cure. Brad Pitts Gerry Lane tries to get his family (from l. Abigail Hargrove and Mireille Enos) to safety in a Philadelphia thats overrun by zombies. (Jaap Buitendijk) Lane crisscrosses the globe managing always to be a step away from the rampaging undead. In Jerusalem theyve built a wall to keep them out -- and let uninfected survivors in. ""Every human we save one less zombie to fight"" says the man in charge just before more mayhem erupts. Escaping from there with a wounded Israeli soldier (Daniella Kertesz) Lane heads to a World Health Organization lab in Wales to find answers. (Here the films four credited screenwriters have a scientist in charge of developing viral antidotes ask ""What do you want here?"" ... But seeing as how there is a zombie pandemic seems WHO wouldnt be a bad resource to check out.) In Brooks book which is basically cannibalized here the kicky detailed narrative was like a ghouls version of ""Traffic"" as various points of view depict a planet breaking at the hinges. The infected storm a formerly safe havein in Israel.... (Jaap Buitendijk) ""WWZ"" the film however feels like a video game. Its merely fast-moving flesh-rippers with clicking jaws giving chase. And up close these walking dead feel almost comical. The movie never follows its undeveloped ideas of mans ecological abuse and comeuppance killing time with throwaway bits like a wacko imprisoned CIA agent (David Morse) muttering about conspiracies. Crucial scenes lose urgency as the film begins to feel desperate for resolution. The guts of it all is an unimaginative overly familiar evade-run-destroy framework. There is a mildly tense rain-soaked escape on a plane thats essentially copied several more times. The been-there gnawed-that result gets moldy without any sparks of inspiration. And as usual theres no reason for the muddy 3-D. At least Pitt whose last full-on summer adventure was 2005s ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" brings solid acting chops to all this silliness (""Translation zombies"" as one authority figure intones). His great recent performances -- Jesse James Benjamin Button an inglorious military bastard the dad in ""The Tree of Life"" and Oakland As GM Billy Beane in ""Moneyball"" -- have shown him maturing into a fatherly forthright thoughtful silver screen presence. ...by scaling a giant wall like an insect horde. ( Paramount Pictures) ""WWZ"" wont eat that away. But the movies director Marc Forster (""Monsters Ball"" ""Finding Neverland"") who showed only a passing affiliation with action in the James Bond quagmire ""Quantum of Solace"" fails to surround Pitt -- or the often digitally created beasties -- with organic thrills. Especially comatose is the last act which was altered and added to in a highly publicized retooling. The storys last-ditch effort to save the world is a serious shot of dingbat. The filmmakers determination to get things right even at great cost is laudable. But ""World War Zs"" problems like a rabid zombie sadly came back to bite it in the ... leg.

But theres a definite reason that ""world"" is in the title ""World War Z"" an apocalyptic thriller that imagines a zombie outbreak that begins in Korea (or is it India?) and spreads to the far corners of the planet. And whither goeth the zombies former U.N. field researcher Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is not far behind hopping from Asia to the Middle East to the United Kingdom in an attempt to quell the outbreak that has turned billions of people into the undead. Unlike the traditional shuffling animated corpses of the classic George Romero school these creepers are fast runners (more akin to the ones in Zack Synders remake of Romeros ""Dawn of the Dead"") and are smart enough to down helicopters by jumping on them en masse or to form human buttresses like ants so that they can climb high walls. Also read Insider China Censors Rejected Brad Pitts World War Z (Exclusive) While ""World War Z"" has no shortage of impressive sights and sounds and plenty of hair-raising moments it gets so lost in its global scale that it doesnt give us a flesh-and-blood hero who makes it all matter. The story starts intimately as Gerry and his wife Karin (Mireille Enos ""The Killing"") drive their two young daughters to school in Philadelphia. But what appears to be a routine traffic jam in the City of Brotherly Love soon turns into a terrifying battle with shrieking running zombies whose victims join their ranks less than 15 seconds after being bitten. The Lanes make it to Newark and a grocery-store looting already in progress and the U.N. sends a copter to pick up Gerry (whos being forced out of retirement) and his family. While the wife and kids are holed up on an aircraft carrier Gerry travels around the world trying to figure out where the outbreak started and how to find a cure. Director Marc Forster (""Monsters Ball"" ""Quantum of Solace"") effectively generates suspense and terror whether operating on a small scale (dark hallways an army base under siege on a rainy night) or huge (the walls of Jerusalem being breached by what appears to be an endless supply of zombies). What Forster cant do alas is make Gerry and everyone else in the film more than just a functionary of the plot. Max Brooks book on which the film is based tells the story of the great zombie outbreak as an oral history with numerous narrators capturing the saga of a global epidemic. A team of screenwriters with no shortage of genre bona fides -- including Drew Goddard (""The Cabin in the Woods"") J. Michael Straczynski (""Babylon 5"") Damon Lindelof (""Lost"") and Matthew Michael Carnahan (""The Kingdom"") -- get the scale right but they make the movie mostly about one guy and then they apparently forgot to write him. While the mock-documentary genre has been somewhat overplayed in recent years using it here would have allowed the filmmakers to tell a far-reaching story in a more journalistic style. Had they stepped back and shown us the big picture that way the movie might have worked; in trying to be huge and intimate at the same time however they lose the personal touch. Pitt pours himself physically into the role but theres not much meat for him to attack dramatically. The character reminded me on more than one occasion of Tom Hanks Vatican expert in those Dan Brown movies Both men jump to brilliant conclusions with the tiniest amounts of evidence and neither of them has a haircut thats flattering to any adult male. ""World War Z"" tries its hardest to tap into the zeitgeist of super-viruses and mega-bacteria that sweeps the global consciousness on a seemingly weekly basis but for all its impressive shots of zombies invading the Taj Mahal it doesnt manifest our fears nearly as well as say ""Contagion"" or ""I Am Legend."" Theres real horror to be found in ""World War Z"" both in its vivid imagining of zombie hordes on the rampage and in its portrayal of cities in ruin and the human race pushed to the brink. For all its effectiveness at portraying the horror of possible human extinction the films actual humans are so soulless that this could just as well be the movie version of the video game ""Plants vs. Zombies.""

Is World War Z Too Smart For Its Own Good? Eric Kohn Jun 18 2013 1053 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Max Brooks 2006 novel ""World War Z"" portrayed a global zombie outbreak in fragments of reports from around the world that minus the flesh-eating reanimated corpse factor could easily have documented more credible diseases. While it roots the same events in the context of one survivors experiences the movie version similarly aims to realistically portray society under the strain of an unstoppable virus to the point where the zombie threat is secondary to the bureaucratic processes it instigates. Not many brains get munched but plenty of people use them. A close cousin of Steven Soderberghs ""Contagion"" Marc Forsters adaption of Brooks tome juts forward with a grave sense of purpose that only works when generating feelings of nervousness and peril to go along with its big ideas. The walking dead are supporting characters in this sincerely thoughtful drama which stumbles along in its cold first hour before reaching a more alarmingly suspenseful climax. ""World War Z"" provokes before it thrills but the concept only gels when those two ingredients come together. The focus on disease comes at the expense of other possibilities. With Brad Pitt as Gerry the calculated U.N. agent scouring the globe in search of a cure ""World War Z"" abandons much of the metaphoric weight encoded into the zombie genres DNA since George Romeros ""Night of the Living Dead"" some 45 years ago. Part of the initial allure of zombies kicked off by Romeros movie and further amplified by his supermall-set sequel ""Dawn of the Dead"" comes from the way the commentary writes itself the zombies as a metaphor for a brain-dead society and the shock of dealing with an attack that comes from within rather than abroad emerge naturally from these tense survival narratives. Romero elevated his B-movie set-up with profound implications. ""World War Z"" thrusts its ideas at you with the serious pose of an international thriller that just happens to include the undead. Despite its cerebral setbacks ""World War Z"" delivers a handful of effectively nail-biting moments. The well-orchestrated opening finds Gerry and his family escaping a zombie-riddled Pennsylvania battling through an infected apartment building and eventually finding shelter in a U.N. relief base. Once there however ""World War Z"" stumbles into the creaky mid-section with Gerry jetting off to the Middle East in search of a cure. By the time he arrives in Israel where the zombies have been kept out by a surrounding wall (har har) ""World War Z"" starts to take on the sluggish feel of a civics course straining to maintain dramatic momentum. Anyone who has appreciated the concept of zombie movies over the years may detect the whiff of condescension in the way ""World War Z"" forces this quintessential manifestation of the American id into a blatantly high brow conceit. Fortunately that unseemly process gives way to a stunningly intense zombie-on-a-plane showdown that segues into the contained setpiece of the final act which takes place inside the infected lab where Gerry closes in on a cure. Once there ""World War Z"" finally reaches a satisfying blend of medical intrigue and taut survivor antics. But even then the dangers maintain a relatively innocuous feel partly because the movies so aggressively PG-13 Theres little in the way of gore or other grotesque imagery to imbue the situation with bonafide terror. Merciful cutaways abound -- you never really see any of these suckers take a bullet to the head -- nor does anybody swear that often. In its quest to smarten up the genre the filmmakers also stiffen it. ""World War Z"" may wear its intellect proudly but also consciously translates the zombie premise into a safer context for wider audiences. Its not the smartest zombie movie ever made but might be the most commercial one.

First sign that this movie was going to be abysmally bad its PG13 now lets think about this for a moment. a movie based on a book about a WORLDWIDE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE that doesnt have a single drop of blood in it not one the animated childrens movie Paranorman had more gore Now i was willing to go into WWZ expecting changes to the book because the scope of the book is huge the book takes on geopolitical politics classism the ignorance of armchair generals and politicians who refuse to believe the threat they are facing till its too late mixed with stories of genuine heroism around the world. The movie has none of this. I just dont get how Hollywood can take a property and totally ignore what made that property fantastic the sad part is this movie will probably make a shitload of money thanks to its multimillion dollar marketing blitzkrieg and since most of the audience wont actually read the book no one will feel the pain I felt while watching this movie. And even sadder is that there was an opportunity to elevate the zombie genre to a whole new plateau. to MAX BROOKS i hope they cut you a huge enough check to deal with the loyal fans of your work who are heartbroken at Hollywoods bastardization of your masterpiece. side note anytime a big time directors (not of the movie in question) comments are used to help market the film know that its gonna be shit (in this case Darren Aronofskys tweets about WWZ scaring the living heck outta him.) watching this movie I was too angry otherwise i would have went to sleep on WORLD WAR Z zzzzzzzzz. Oh well i guess ill have to wait for the next season of The Walking Dead to get my proper zombie fix. FIN. Reply troy May 12 2016 149 pm It is an expensive film .Perhaps the idea was to replace art with gimmickry. Reply Irf May 12 2016 149 pm It most certainly is the most expensive zombie film ever made. I read an article about how much the studio bottled it and how it was actually a cooler project in its previous drafts (http//movies-on-my-mind.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/world-war-z-defines-just-how-much-weve.html). I still want to see it. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Destruction is scary but not half as scary as the act of rebuilding the moment of looking at the random jagged pieces youve got left and wondering how the hell youre going to fit them together. In Marc Forsters World War Z the world as we know it--or even as we dont really know it--is destroyed by a virus that turns people into zombies. Within 12 seconds of being bitten by an infected host any human will turn into a twisted soulless creature with cloudy heroin-addict eyes motivated only by a ravenous need to hunt down and tear into healthy flesh. Brad Pitt plays a New York City family man--a U.N. peacekeeper turned househusband if you can imagine such a thing--who strives to protect his family from these fearsome drones at first by sticking close but later by leaving them. The best way to save them he realizes is to serve the greater good and find the source of the killer virus. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Its all pretty noble and if nothing else World War Z shows off some horrifically effective filmmaking An early sequence in which Pitts Gerry figures out something has gone terribly wrong as hes driving his wife (Mireille Enos of Big Love and The Killing) and two generically adorable daughters from here to there in Manhattan is that rare evocation of chaos that isnt chaotic itself. Shot and edited with chilling clarity it shows us vehicles colliding in seconds that feel like eons or vice versa; metal crumples like paper and glass shatters as if invested with demonic life.But Forsters meticulousness--coupled with ample excuses to blow stuff up--isnt enough to turn World War Z into one of those class-A end-of-everything movies that leaves you feeling just a little bit queasy momentarily uncertain of your own small place in this unmanageable world. The picture is suitably solemn but its never mournful at least not in the manner of say Juan Carlos Fresnadillos 28 Weeks Later the superb follow-up to Danny Boyles good-enough 28 Days Later. Maybe thats because 28 Weeks Later isnt about a world being destroyed but one thats trying to start back up and just cant. Fresnadillos film rings instead with a terrifying yet vaguely cozy end-of-the-world feeling a vibe straight out of John Wyndhams half-disconsolate half-optimistic 50s apocalyptic novel Day of the Triffids.Film Details World War Z RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time116 More Info Trailer That kind of subtlety is probably too much to expect from World War Z. This is massive-scale 3D filmmaking and in that context some of it works like gangbusters. Early in the movie Gerrys family finds both terror and small acts of kindness in a Newark supermarket-turned-free-for-all Forster films the sequence so we feel the weight and meaning of both the horror and the humanity. And the human-to-zombie transformation itself is pretty scary beginning with a clattery death twitch and ending with a superhuman surge that launches the newly zombified individual into action. (These are fast zombies not the slow kind and you really want to be able to outrun them.)The picture tangles with some potentially fascinating geopolitical ideas too. Most of the world was unprepared for this disastrous zombie invasion but Israel saw the whole thing coming and built a giant wall around the city of Jersualem to keep the angry mindless critters out. Lest you think this is an anti-Semitic gag along the lines of those nutso ""Jewish leaders sent a memo out on the morning of 9/11 to tell all Jews to stay home from work that day"" theories note the twist The wall was built only to keep zombies out; healthy humans are welcome to enter a marked contrast from the way Gerrys own employer the U.S. government treats its own citizens during the crisis.But World War Z doesnt really know what to do with those larger philosophical ideas. Forster moves the action forward deftly scene by scene yet the movie ends up feeling sprawling and empty a ""zombies invaded the world and all I got was a lousy T-shirt"" enterprise. In fact World War Z may be an object lesson in the importance of paying attention to small-scale filmmaking within the framework of big-budget wizardry. Because in the end all that matters in World War Z is Brad Pitt.Pitt was at one time the sexiest man alive or something like that. But he has evolved into an actor whos always worth watching having turned casualness into a discernible potent style. In World War Z hes a deeply comforting presence the dad who promises to take care of everything--everything--and actually manages to do so. I can think of few contemporary actors sex symbols or otherwise who have played fathers--particularly fathers of daughters--without veering into sentimental quicksand. When Gerry decides to go out virus-hunting leaving his family in the allegedly safe hands of the U.S. military he kisses one of his little girls goodbye bringing as much relaxed grace to the gesture as any anxious zombie-fearing father could. He calls her ""babydoll"" a nickname she says she doesnt like--shes not a baby. Quick on his feet he comes back with the right response ""OK tall beautiful tiny adult."" Those are the words he leaves her with before going off to save the world. Zombies are no match for a man who knows just what to say to a little girl.Follow VoiceFilmClub2 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

As I understand it fidelity to Max Brooks best-selling novel has been scant at best but neither that nor countless post-production woes prevent Paramounts costly adaptation from ultimately serving as an efficient and effectively exciting globe-spanning zombie thriller. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) may be new to the whole stay-at-home-dad thing but his old ties to the United Nations come in handy when he and his are forced to flee Philadelphia in the wake of a chaotic outbreak. It turns out that zombies have infected the populations of America and countless other countries and if Lane can hope to keep his family safe on a naval carrier far from the infected then he must venture back into the world to assist the government in finding an origin for the disease and hopefully a cure. The particulars of Gerrys former U.N. gig are tough to gather just that he has experience keeping his cool in hot zones and the kind of vaguely vital bona fides to redirect an airliner with one well-placed phone call. Beyond that Pitt proves himself credibly resourceful (taping magazines across his arms to prevent being bitten) fairly intelligent and -- in another summer chock full of supermen -- distinctly vulnerable to injury. Director Marc Forster (""Quantum of Solace"") smartly surrounds one of the worlds most famous faces with relative unknowns to then sell the notion that his hero is but one man up against universally dire odds and for the most part the supporting ranks manage to still stake their claim opposite the superstar whether its Mireille Enos as wife Karen James Badge Dale as a gruffly pragmatic soldier Elyes Gabel as a cocky virologist David Morse as a rogue CIA agent or Daniella Kertesz as a particularly devoted bodyguard. (On the flipside Matthew Fox fleetingly appears in a blink-and-miss-it military role.) The zombie lore offered here is fairly fresh opting for a fast and feral pack mentality more prone to virulent violence than traditional cannibalism making it all the easier to grow in number. The scope of the infection is appropriately overwhelming and while the bloodless limitations of a PG-13 rating are occasionally impossible to ignore the jittery intensity of Forsters early set pieces demonstrate a welcome improvement on the nigh incoherent action sequences of his Bond entry. (With that said I struggle to believe that the herky-jerky camerawork and frequently dim settings would benefit from a 3-D viewing.) Whats more the whip-crack pacing keeps the mood tense throughout even when the would-be ticking-clock subplot of Lanes family being kicked off the overcrowded carrier is inevitably given short shrift. Without ever going full ""Kumbaya"" Forsters approach to this global catastrophe is a worldly and humane one. Looting and panic make their due appearances but more often than not the people Gerry meets are unified by their border-crashing plight rather than being prone to acts of random cruelty as is so often a given in apocalyptic fare. Of course all the good intentions in the world cant stop a mindless menace from busting down doors and that celebratory spirit of unity even doubles as a fatal dinner bell once the seemingly impervious walls of Jerusalem are circumvented by the good old-fashioned teamwork of some commendably cooperative zombies. Although credited to four different writers the screenplay is nonetheless littered with clever little ways by which to expedite the usual mayhem a dropped toy unwittingly counting off the seconds it takes for transmission to take hold or in a particularly nerve-racking sequence the quick and quiet team effort to keep infected airline passengers back in coach where they belong. Many an ultimatum arises to force Gerry into action alleviating some of the messiah complex that tends to come with this territory (cough ""I Am Legend"" cough) and making his heroic deeds more viable to the audience. The seams of rewrites and reshoots become most apparent with the arrival of the third act which places an evident emphasis on quiet horror over hectic action swapping out digital hordes for more shambling foes in proper make-up. Even this sequence maintains a remarkable tension though and while some may rightfully see it as being constrictive for a movie of supposedly worldwide proportions it feels borderline subversive in a season of tentpoles where a bigger climax is automatically assumed to be a better one. Movement is life but when it counts ""World War Z"" chooses to step carefully.

Rising from an early grave of negative pre-release publicity director Marc Forster and producer-star Brad Pitts much-maligned ""World War Z"" emerges as a surprisingly smart gripping and imaginative addition to the zombie-movie canon owing as much to scientific disaster movies like ""The China Syndrome"" and ""Contagion"" as it does to undead ur-texts like the collected works of George Romero. Showing few visible signs of the massive rewrites reshoots and other post-production patchwork that delayed its release from December 2012 this sleekly crafted often nail-biting tale of global zombiepocalypse clicks on both visceral and emotional levels resulting in an unusually serious-minded summer entertainment whose ideal audience might be described as comicbook fanboys who also listen to ""Democracy Now."" Opening a week apart from the more four-quadrant-friendly ""Man of Steel"" in most markets ""World War Z"" should post solid enough numbers at home and abroad but with a rumored final cost well north of 200 million itll need more than a bit of kryptonite up its sleeve to push far into profitability.This story first appeared in the June 11 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. A flexible metaphor for all manner of social cultural and political maladies the zombie genre has over the decades been employed as an analogue for everything from the U.S. occupation of Haiti (1932s Bela Lugosi starrer ""White Zombie"") to the upheaval of the Vietnam/civil rights era (""Night of the Living Dead"") and the bio-panics of the late 20th century (""28 Days Later"" ""Resident Evil""). Significantly expanding the claustrophobic geography of most zombie pics the aptly titled ""World War Z"" doesnt have a particular polemical axe to grind so much as it seeks to imagine how the worlds ideologically disparate peoples and governments would respond if great masses of the populi did suddenly turn into rabid flesh-eating beasties. In what may be taken as an affront by the America First crowd the old U.S. of A. descends into chaos pretty early on while the two nations best equipped for the coming onslaught turn out to be Israel and North Korea -- the former by building an enormous wall the latter by extracting the teeth of its entire population. No biting no zombies see? Not that any makeshift solution lasts for long in ""World War Z"" whose undead prove terrifyingly hardy and lightning-quick sprinting into spastic action when they sense fresh meat is near and turning their victims into fellow travelers in a matter of seconds. We first seem them wreaking havoc on a downtown Philly traffic jam -- a genuinely spectacular and unsettling orgy of mob panic from which world-weary ex-United Nations investigator Gerry Lane (Pitt) barely emerges with his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) two young daughters and own body fully intact. Fleeing in a stolen camper they hightail it to Newark where they await extraction from Gerrys former U.N. boss Thierry (the excellent South African actor Fana Mokoena) but not before waiting out the night in a rundown apartment building transformed by Forster into a skin-crawling succession of winding shadowy corridors and flickering fluorescent bulbs. (The generally arresting cinematography is credited solely to Michael Bay collaborator Ben Seresin though the pic was begun by Oscar winner Robert Richardson.) Adapted by a small army of screenwriters from the bestselling novel by Max (son of Mel) Brooks the pic abandons its source materials choral ""oral history"" structure to hone in on the Lanes who after once again negotiating a narrow escape find themselves ensconced in the relative safety of an aircraft carrier somewhere in the Atlantic. At this de facto command center for what remains of the U.S. military Thierry wastes no time in giving Gerry an ultimatum Go back into the war zone on the U.N.s behalf or else be sent right back to zombie-infested Philly with his family in tow. And from there ""World War Z"" hopscotches the globe as Gerry (in the company of various military escorts) searches for the proverbial ""patient zero"" and the possibility of a cure. PHOTOS Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie Attend World War Z Premiere Something the writers and Forster have cribbed well from the Romero playbook They waste little time with scene-setting niceties plunging us straight into the thick of zombie mayhem and Pitt notwithstanding they dont afford anyone star treatment. Characters who initially seem poised to become significant supporting players -- among them Army Rangers James Badge Dale and Matthew Fox and rogue CIA operative David Morse -- prove expendable either by becoming food for the encroaching zombie horde or simply by virtue of the pic moving on to another locale first a ghostly military base in South Korea that might be the source of the outbreak; then to Israel where a senior Mossad agent (well played by Dutch filmmaker Ludi Boeken) may hold some additional clues; and finally a WHO research lab in Wales where -- in the pics most elegantly crafted setpiece -- Gerry and a handful of uninfected scientists enter into a careful cat-and-mouse game with the otherwise zombified staff. Considering the incoherent shambles he made out of his James Bond movie ""Quantum of Solace"" Forster handles the large-scale action here with considerable aplomb and much striking imagery enhanced by the seamless mix of choreography prosthetics and CG that bring the herking jerking zombies to ""life."" That these zombies have particularly sensitive hearing allows Forster and his sound designers a field day with creaking doors broken glass crunching underfoot and in one especially tense moment a soda can rolling across a cafeteria floor. Moreover the director always keeps the movie rooted in a compelling dramatic situation with Pitt giving a very appealing turn as the seen-it-all veteran of the worlds worst places whose desire to protect his family trumps his desire to save the world. By todays standards hes a refreshingly human-scaled movie hero with no outsized strength agility or superpowers to help him win the day. Despite having little screen time and even less dialogue the marvelous Enos manages to suggest a full range of wifely and motherly emotions through the subtlest of glances and smiles that mask her pain. Israeli-born newcomer Daniella Kertesz also makes a strong impression as the soldier who accompanies Gerry on the last leg of his journey including a harrowing Jerusalem-Cardiff flight with some most unfriendly passengers in coach.

GarryP says November 2 2015 at 250 am I dont care about this im earning around 4500 a month. There is very useful way i found on the web. If you want to learn it too simply type in google Willis Mounts Strategy Reply Jacobus says June 30 2013 at 855 am A fine example of how the culture of fear has penetrated deep into our society. WWZ has given viewers a chance to justify mass slaughter on a global holocaust level. Be aware you are watching and giving your money to a piece of propaganda. When a set of people can be identified as less than human then it becomes easier to justify their mass genocide. Yes zombies are nasty but also fictional. When the camouflage is developed zombies become able to be tolerated in society. Giving the world represented by a very American UN agent and a silhouetted duck hunter a chance to find a cure. However ""others""in the worl find other solutions ie visions of mass burning pyres of human bodies at a time in the chronology of the film a stasis has been reached. Now America can rise to the protection of the persecuted zombie population and justify war in the future. Sounds like a lot of mind wiping for todays bored movie goers. If you like Doomsday Prepers this is the film for you. ""Be ready for anything."" Reply Denise says June 25 2013 at 440 am Im afraid to say that this is the worst film I have ever seen. More than half of the audience in the cinema I attended left after 15 minutes and the rest spent the remainder of the film in hysterics over the teeth banging badly made up zombies. I thought being a Brad Pitt film this would be something special but sadly I was mistaken. Id leave this one off of his resume if I were him. Reply bloodyneptune says June 23 2013 at 658 am Because the idea of an entire nation ripping out its peoples teeth in like 2 days is totally intelligent and believable. The book itself focuses on the socio-ecological hurdles that Israel faces with the Palestinians during the Great Denial. Theres also an entire chapter dedicated to the psychology of North Korea VS South and the fact that all of North Koreas population disappeared thought maybe to have gone underground. It was far from ""they built a wall and they pulled everyones teeth out."" This is why so many people hate this movie. Reply tf says June 18 2013 at 408 pm The glaring problem with Z is the cgi; the terrible ""rat like scurry"" atop of one another we see the human zombies do repeatedly throughout the trailer and feature. Really? Did the filmmakers watch a nature film about rats and decide to cookie-cutter it into every zombie scene? Its terrible and a joke for a feature with a 200 mil budget. Pass. Reply Tb says June 10 2013 at 559 am I know a lot of zombie freaks and none listen to Democracy Now. I guess thats why youre not into marketing Reply RobThom says June 9 2013 at 1119 pm ""whose ideal audience might be described as comicbook fanboys who also listen to ""Democracy Now."""" Are you implying that this movie best appeals to people with the maturity of 13 year olds who are also lib zealots? Well if that aint smart gripping and imaginative then I must be reading variety. Reply Dexie Varton says June 9 2013 at 1029 pm i saw the trailers and it looks worth watching. i love the book also. Reply Mrs. Horror Boom (HorrorBoom.com) says June 7 2013 at 908 pm Reblogged this on HORROR BOOM and commented Pulling all the teeth? We never thought of that before... Reply avietar says June 7 2013 at 954 pm Anybody whos ever seen the 1948 Bob Hope comedy ""The Paleface"" knows where THAT came from (I hope the Koreans used laughing gas like ""Painless"" Potter but I doubt it). Reply 3x slimming power says June 6 2013 at 1125 pm World War Z Review Brad Pitt Stars in a Surprisingly Smart Gripping Zombie Thriller | Variety Reply Dan Cordova says June 6 2013 at 259 pm Reviewer Dan Cordova of examiner.com anticipates a chance for a Chicago preview of World War Z Reply The Kingslayer says June 5 2013 at 1031 am Huh this is the first positive review Ive seen online. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says June 5 2013 at 914 am There is a ""crowd psychology"" that amounts to public opinion giving a film negative reviews before it has a chance to open; the opposite is also true in the case of MAN OF STEEL revered well before the fact of its release. One might (ironically) imagine WORLD WAR Z as the one movie to give MOS a run for its money at the box office. All depends on that crowd psychology of course. Reply bloodyneptune says June 23 2013 at 649 am Its less ""crowd psychology"" and more ""a ton of people whove read an amazing book and are watching a random zombie movie use its title."" Reply Rick Blaine says June 5 2013 at 556 am The blame for the incoherent shambles Forster made with Quantum of Solace can be laid squarely at the feet of the producers of the film. First they hire a guy with absolutely no big budget action movie experience then they give him free rein. With World War Z it looks like Pitt and the studio ran a much tighter ship. And just as well. If the film is good and a big success it will be an object lesson in how to keep a rookie on a tight leash. Reply mroyan says June 5 2013 at 317 am Home in on...is the correct expression in this case. Hone is to sharpen Home is to move toward. Reply Sage on the Hudson says June 4 2013 at 423 pm ""Adapted by a small army of screenwriters from the bestselling novel by Max (son of Mel) Brooks the pic abandons its source materials choral ""oral history"" structure to hone in on the Lanes..."" The expression is HOME in (like a homing pigeon) Scott. Reply Mister_Salty says June 4 2013 at 455 pm Check your dictionary Sage. The expression ""hone in on"" is absolutely the correct one in this context. Reply Sage on the Hudson says June 4 2013 at 536 pm No its NOT (you do the checking). If home and hone were not near homophones no one would EVER make the mistake of substituting the latter for the former because the latters meaning simply doesnt fit. LOL says June 4 2013 at 139 pm Yup VARIETY ran the same review last year for ""Men in Black III"" saying the troubled shooting experience made for a surprisingly quality movie which it didnt. This movie had great script written by J. Michael Straczynski and then they (Plan B) decided to make it more of an action movie that appeals to redneck idiots... Reply mroyan says June 5 2013 at 318 am Hone is incorrect as it means to sharpen - as in the hone your skills. Home is to move toward. Reply Dave Baxter says June 4 2013 at 154 pm ""Great script written by J. Michael Straczynski"" is a logical fallacy - the former cannot come from the latter. You may also have missed the point that WWZ struck the reviewer as taking a lot from ""Contagion"" and ""China Syndrome"" neither of which are ""action movies"" and neither likely appealing to ""redneck idiots"" who definitely do not listen to ""Democracy Now"" as the review pegs WWZs best bet for an audience. But thanks for not reading the article and sharing random pointless thoughts with the rest of us. Its awesome when people do that. Reply LOL says June 7 2013 at 1210 pm ""Marc [Forster] wanted to make a big huge action movie that wasnt terribly smart and had big huge action pieces... If all you wanted to do was an empty-headed Rambo-versus-the-zombies action film why option this really elegant smart book?"" J. Michael Straczynski in this months ""Vanity Fair"". Take that Dave Baxter katy says June 4 2013 at 534 pm Straczynski is getting credited so they have used some of his script ) LOL says June 4 2013 at 135 pm Yup VARIETY ran the same review last year for ""Men in Black III"" saying the troubled shooting experience made for a surprisingly quality movie which it didnt.

Reply Rooksx says June 4 2013 at 129 pm Exactly why do you feel the need to litter your review with spoilers? Ridiculous.

Daily Edition Login to download World War Z Film Review 1211 PM PDT 6/4/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS An action-packed mainstreaming of a more ambitious book. TWITTER Brad Pitt delivers a capable performance in an immersive apocalyptic spectacle about a global zombie uprising. Waves of startling action counterbalance standard one-man-saves-the-day Hollywood heroics in World War Z an immersive apocalyptic spectacle that tosses the viewer into the deep end of a global zombie uprising and doesnt let up until close to the end. A bunch of impressive set pieces stitched together rather than a good story convincingly told this gargantuan production should ride Brad Pitts name teeming action scenes and widespread interest in all things zombie to strong box office returns particularly internationally. Whether it will be enough to compensate Paramount and the assorted producers for the 200 million-plus investment and all their production headaches is something theyll have to sweat out. While date-night thrill-seekers should be amply satisfied by this ramrod pedal-to-the-metal confrontation with a zombie plague fans of Max Brooks 2006 best-seller will find much to be disappointed in. Subtitled ""An Oral History of the Zombie War"" the savvy engaging novel was written as a series of postwar interviews with people all over the world that provided a reasonably comprehensive and intriguingly political mosaic portrait of how and why the international calamity played out the way it did. PHOTOS World War Z Premiere The Zombie Apocalypse Starts in London A faithful adaptation of the book would have structurally resembled Steven Soderberghs 2011 global-reach thriller Contagion just as it would have retained loads of political material that as lead producer Pitt himself has bemoaned is simply not compatible with the financial imperatives of a big-budget blockbuster. Exhibit A Brooks (the son of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft) makes it clear that the zombie outbreak began in China; fearful that this little detail might prevent exhibition in the worlds most populous nation the filmmakers decided that China should go unmentioned. What could have been an artistically ambitious multiperspective look at how modern ideological and religious disarray opened the door for catastrophe has implausibly but understandably been reduced to the story of a classic reluctant heros effort to do what the collective global governments and science geniuses cannot get to the root of why there are suddenly so many drooling groaning jerking and amazingly fast-moving ghouls running around the world interested only in feasting on their former fellow human beings. Having committed to making the film a wire-to-wire exercise in eluding extreme jeopardy director Marc Forster and his battery of screenwriters (Matthew Michael Carnahan of The Kingdom Drew Goddard of Cloverfield and TVs Lost Damon Lindelof of Star Trek Into Darkness Prometheus and Cowboys amp; Aliens as well as Lost and screen story scribe and original adapter J. Michael Straczynski of Changeling and Thor) have worked out a scenario that feels more like a travel itinerary. Faced with gridlock in downtown Philadelphia that represents the havoc the undead are causing all over the world retired United Nations troubleshooter Gerry Lane (Pitt) gets his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and two daughters as far as Newark before his former boss Thierry (Fana Mokoena) sends a chopper to rescue them from a rooftop and spirit them to the temporary haven of command central aboard an Atlantic Ocean-based vessel. PHOTOS Damon Lindelofs 400 Million Mind Although its not entirely clear how Gerrys experience with terrorist actions in Chechnya and Africa make him the worlds No. 1 go-to guy to solve the zombie problem the bearded long-haired dude is instantly dispatched to rainy South Korea where he is advised that the North Koreans have cleverly nipped zombieism in the bud through mandatory nationwide teeth extraction. A tense attack drives Gerry back on the plane to head for Israel the only nation that as of now is winning the war against the living dead. From the cockpit Gerry is startled by what appears to be a nuclear mushroom cloud down below an arresting vision to be sure but one that oddly goes unmentioned thereafter. The subsequent siege of Jerusalem is unquestionably the great set piece of the film a spectacular display of the chaotic but comprehensible victory of a staggering number of flesh-eaters finally surmounting the formidable barriers imposed by well-prepared defenders. Covered from all perspectives from the jammed immigrations lines of sanctuary-seekers to the aerial views revealing the citys warren of ancient corridors and walls the convulsive action climaxes with Gerry and a scared wounded but capable female soldier Segen (Daniella Kertesz) desperately climbing aboard the last plane out a ride which itself becomes another visceral action interlude of a fairly high order. Much has been made of how the final act as originally shot didnt pan out and was rewritten and refilmed at considerable expense. In the event the scale and focus of the film is greatly narrowed in the climactic 20 minutes. Set at a top-secret medical research facility in Wales the sequence is a fairly simple reasonably well-executed cat-and-mouse game in which Gerry Segen and a scientist are forced to sneak through a zombie-occupied building to grab a substance that may or may not hold the key to stemming the wars tide. The quiet pared-down nature of the sequence contrasts strongly with everything thats gone before which is not a bad thing although the very ending rather flatly wraps everything up in a jiffy. VIDEO Brad Pitt Introduces Marc Fosters Zombie Thriller World War Z There is certainly a tension running through the film between latent serious ambition and lowest-common-denominator-pleasing requirements with the latter ruling the day most of the time without entirely erasing evidence of the former. Notwithstanding the expectation that the brave leading man and his adored family will somehow come out of it all unscathed there are a few narrative surprises along the way and an absence of dumb clunking dialogue that often infects such fare. Aside from Pitt who strides through it all capably and without leading-man airs the cast is fleshed out with mostly little-known actors. Gerrys wifethe U.N. boss and the Israeli soldier for instance could easily have been cast with names but having relatively fresh nondistracting faces in these roles plays well. Kertesz in particular gets a big chance with her part and makes the most of it. On the craft side its easy to see where the money went as scene after scene overflows with hordes of people (many of them CGI-generated) and elaborate backgrounds. The film is a feast for the eyes (the 3D conversion is very good) while the zombie horror consists mostly of mild jolts rather than shocks. Ben Seresin receives sole cinematography credit although Robert Richardson was the director of photography on the initial shoot. Marco Beltramis score is almost always there to supply further adrenaline. Opens June 21 (Paramount) Production Skydance Prods.
