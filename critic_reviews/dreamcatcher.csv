Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 21 2003 218 PM Little Brown Men The aliens of Dreamcatcher have a taste for human rectums. By David Edelstein Dreamcatchers Gang of Four. Its a nutty experience watching Lawrence Kasdans adaptation of the Stephen King book Dreamcatcher (Warner Bros.) What the blazes is this thing? The novel itself has little internal logic. King is dreamily free-associating which doesnt mean hes plumbing his unconscious in search of new nightmare archetypes; it means hes recycling bits of old horror and sci-fi flicks and even setups from his own novels. This one resembles Kings It (which itself is like ""The Stand By Me Kids vs. The Monster"") but it also filches ideas from the movies Alien (1979) the John Carpenter remake of The Thing (1982) Dr. Strangelove (1964) The Hidden (1987) and even the overheated plague picture Outbreak (1995). Advertisement Its a mystery how such a hodgepodge at once incoherent and overfamiliar could have come together on screen. Kasdan (working from a scenario devised by William Goldman) has chosen to tell the story in a leisurely classical style putting faith in the narrative itself--evidently hoping that these hand-me-down strands will somehow coalesce into a tight web of horror. But it would take a lame insect indeed to be ensnared in this raggedy-ass shambles. The first part of the movie has a pleasantly one-thing-after-another quality and there is a sort of suspense What is this movie about? Dreamcatcher opens with four episodes in the lives of four 30ish Maine friends--Henry (Thomas Jane) Jonesy (Damian Lewis) Pete (Timothy Olyphant) and Beaver (Jason Lee)--who have a vaguely telepathic rapport and some stray paranormal abilities. A flashback reveals that these powers date from the day that as kids they saved a runty stuttering child known as Duddits from a bunch of older bullies attempting to make him eat poop. Hearing the voice of Duddits Jonesy strolls into traffic and is flattened by a car. But wait six months later hes alive and the four buddies are heading off on their annual winter hunting trip into the woods of Maine. Its here that an already fragmented story splinters off into yet more tributaries each suggesting a different genre. First the four banter for a while in Quentin Tarantino-like fashion about movies. Then as a storm moves in Jonesy and Beaver encounter a disoriented man (Eric Keenleyside) with a spidery rash who says hes lost in the woods. After he emits a series of titanic gurgling belches and farts it becomes increasingly likely that what he has is no ordinary gastrointestinal virus. The eellike creature with gnashing teeth that eventually rockets from his rectum is another clue. Soon a Disney-esque assortment of animals (bears rabbits deer raccoons) goes bounding by the snowbound cabin while Army choppers overhead announce that the area has been quarantined. Then comes a long long scene in which the fanatical Col. Curtis (Morgan Freeman) hectors his second-in-command Owen (Tom Sizemore) on the subject of his record of battling extraterrestrials and blows the fingers off a young soldier whom he suspects of being too nice to an infected woman. While the population of central Maine is herded into a camp for presumed extermination by the Army ""blue boys"" Jonesys body is possessed by an English-accented alien known as ""Mr. Gray"" who needs directions to I-95. Luckily part of Jonesys mind (represented by a giant old-fashioned storage library in which different memories are assigned to different aisles) remains in his control which means that he might be able to reach out telepathically to his buddies before Mr. Gray gets to the interstate and blankets the Eastern Seaboard with alien parasites. Advertisement Somehow Duddits--who actually mentioned Mr. Gray as a boy although his speech defect made the name come out as ""Mr. Gay""--is at the center of this maelstrom. Can the grown cancer-ridden Duddits (Donnie Wahlberg) hold the key to stopping this plague? Was the telepathic link among the four boys intended to forestall an intergalactic war? The temptation to give the movie points for weirdness is strong. Maybe if Dreamcatcher had come in at 90 action-packed asshole-busting minutes it would have gone down as a head movie on the order of Plan Nine From Outer Space (1959). But at two-and-a-quarter hours its unconscionably pokey. I felt sorry for the editors Carol Littleton and Raul Davalos during the climax They have to stretch out Jonesy/Mr. Grays attempt to pry open a reservoir manhole so he can infect the populace while the rest of the cast rolls around in the snow and has gunfights and helicopter chases ""Ughhh this is heeeeeavy""--CLANK. Rat-tat-tat. Blam blam blam. ""Almoooost got it""--CLANK. Blam Rat-tat-tat ""Drop that manhole cover Mr. Gay"" The four young heroes do their manly best though its a shame that the most colorless of them (Thomas Jane) emerges as the action hero while the more idiosyncratic Lee and Olyphant fall by the wayside. Freeman tries to play an over-the-top character naturalistically which kills the momentum of the army scenes--and they need all the momentum they can get. Sizemore looks as if he wandered onto the set at the last minute Is the character getting messages beamed into his head by extraterrestrials or is the actor getting lines whispered into his ear by a script girl? The FX guys have devised some great squiggly thingummies and the pivotal toilet-bowl scene has a black-comic charge youre not likely to forget. Maybe thats appropriate I am tempted to say that what King has concocted consciously or not is an elaborate allegory for homosexual panic complete with anal intrusion by toothy phalluses and a resulting (Mr.) Gay Plague. There are practically no women in the picture It all comes down to four buddies a frail mommas boy with a terminal disease and a bunch of ""blue boys"" devising a sort of catchers mitt for killer eels and worms-- No sorry I cant go on. As Bill Murray put it in Tootsie (1982) ""Were getting into a weird area here."" Maybe Gus Van Sant could have run with it. But Kasdan is boringly straight so whatever is really at the core of Dreamcatcher remains well er impacted. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Directed by Lawrence Kasdan from a screenplay by William Goldman and Kasdan based on the novel by Stephen King. 136 minutes. Rated R for violence gore and language. Several theaters. Showing with the short film ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" directed by Andy Jones. Stephen Kings novel ""Dreamcatcher"" sprawls all over the place for 600-plus pages encompassing mental telepathy alien invasion military paranoia disaster of worldwide proportions early midlife crisis life death distress of the lower intestine alcoholism the importance of childhood friendships and much more written with heart and without brevity in a seemingly unending forward motion. ""Dreamcatcher"" the movie keeps all of these plot elements but takes out all the character development and explanations. Whats left is a head-scratchingly silly B-movie blending boyish sentiment and cheesy creature effects that even Morgan Freeman cant save. Its hard to imagine what director Lawrence Kasdan (""Body Heat"" ""The Big Chill"") could have been thinking; perhaps an alien took over the editing room. Though many of Kings novels have successfully been brought to the screen this one arrives with the whiff of desperation -- and of something else. Its as if the author was issuing a wicked challenge to filmmakers How do you make flatulence here intended to convey a mysterious inner presence scary? Or cinematically create aliens that spectacularly emerge from ones intestinal tract -- ""blasting out the basement door"" as Freemans character cryptically notes? In William Goldman and Kasdans too-literal adaptation of the novel we quickly meet the four childhood friends at the center of the story whove kept their bond over the years because of an old friendship with an angelic telepathic disabled boy named Duddits. (Hes not really a character just a sentimental plot device.) Henry (Thomas Jane) Pete (Timothy Olyphant) Jonesy (Damian Lewis) and Beav (Jason Lee) all grown up with problems of their own reunite for their annual hunting trip to a remote Maine cabin. When a disoriented hunter named Rick (Eric Keenlyside) stumbles out of the woods complaining of hellish digestive distress -- well off we go on Kings roller-coaster as something nasty slithers out of Rick and gets busy redecorating the cabin in what looks like blood-red mold. Meanwhile the animals all mysteriously skedaddle as if theyre heading off for Noahs Ark. And ... well it gets weirder from there. The cast particularly Lee valiantly tries to have a little fun with this -- were clearly not in the realm of serious horror. But its a lost cause and sometimes their desperation is visible. Theyre simply given nothing to play -- even Freeman who can usually find a character where none existed on the page draws a blank. (His nutso alien hunter is named Kurtz -- as in ""Heart of Darkness""/ ""Apocalypse Now"" -- in the book. The screenwriters changed the name to Curtis presumably to avoid providing any insight.) And well lets just talk for a minute about those aliens who bear a rather alarming resemblance to a male body part normally not glimpsed at the multiplexes -- that is if that body part had teeth. (Skeptics should consult page 178 in the hardcover edition of ""Dreamcatcher"" in which King describes the creature using metaphoric language I cannot repeat in this family newspaper.) This plus the creatures propensity to attack male victims in the crotch seems at times to be turning ""Dreamcatcher"" into some sort of odd statement on male anxiety into which I dare not probe. Please. Its scary enough thinking about what kind of description was given to the creatures hapless behind-the-scenes builders. ""Dreamcatcher"" is showing with ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" inspired by ""The Matrix"" and intended to stir up excitement for ""The Matrix Reloaded"" which opens May 15. A combination of CG animation and Japanese anime its occasionally thrilling and more often silly (yes thong underwear is quite popular in the cyberfuture).

"Dreamcatcher Things That Go Plop in the Night washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Dreamcatcher Things That Go Plop in the Night Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 21 2003 You have to say this about ""Dreamcatcher."" Its not just crazy its really crazy. Its a Stephen King movie on a cocktail of steroids and amphetamines a blast of delicious insanity that recognizes no borders no laws of physics no hopes of redemption. Baby it just goes and goes and goes. Hmmmm. Lets see. Its an old-friends-from-childhood movie like ""Stand by Me."" But its also a crazy-general movie like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and that means of course it must offer a corollary to the crazy general in the form of an opposing force so that means its also a heroic-colonel movie. But its a monster movie too where a big toothy slithery wet tube of goo eats people. Oh wait I forgot this Its a fungus-among-us movie Oh then its an ""Alien"" movie only the creature comes out a little south of the chest. Briefly its a helicopter attack movie. Not briefly enough its a isnt-it-funny-what-goes-on-in-the-bathroom movie with a specialization in the noises methane production entails. Then its a round-up-the-townies-and-put-em-in-the-stockade movie like ""Besieged."" By the way its also an ironic-alien-with-a-British-accent movie.

Starring Morgan Freeman Thomas Jane Jason Lee Tom Sizemore Timothy Olyphant and Damian Lewis. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Lawrence Kasdans movies tend to be introspective and Stephen King s movies tend to be schlock so one might reasonably expect ""Dreamcatcher"" Kasdans adaptation of Kings novel to be introspective schlock. But its not. Its something else not the product of two styles blending but the product of two styles in collision a crazy mess -- and kind of fun for that reason. All the same these are two fellows who have no business collaborating. In ""Dreamcatcher"" aliens invade but the clash of civilizations has nothing on the conflict between the serious film about friendship that Kasdan seems to be trying to make and the demented rococo monster movie that Kings story cries out for. Watching it its possible to tick off scenes -- Kasdan King King Kasdan Kasdan -- and know which vision is dominating at any point. PRESCIENT PALS We begin in a Kasdan world of middle-class educated professionals. In a series of short scenes we meet four friends -- played by Thomas Jane Jason Lee Timothy Olyphant and Damian Lewis -- who each have something in common. They can read peoples minds. The buddies go to a cabin in the woods for a weekend and the camaraderie of the men as well as the specificity with which their interaction and personalities are delineated is very much in the Kasdan style. Its what this director does well. Henry (Jane) is a somewhat depressive psychiatrist; Jonesy (Lewis) a sensitive teacher; Pete (Olyphant) a drunk with a bitter streak; and Beaver (Lee) a likable loudmouth. We believe that these friends have known each other for years and wed never expect that a single one of them is being set up to be gored and devoured by a space alien. When the movie switches to a flashback of the fellows as schoolboys 20 years before theres a whiff of ""Stand by Me"" in the air. But again the handling of the scene -- the boys rescue from bullies an idiot savant with special psychic powers -- is low-key detailed and grounded in emotion. The jolt into King-land doesnt come until later when back in the present a hunter shows up at the fellows cabin splattered with blood and of course disgustingly flatulent. THE BIG SPILL Imagine if in Kasdans ""The Big Chill"" some worm-shaped alien suddenly burrowed its way into say Jeff Goldblum and he started hemorrhaging everywhere. Or better yet imagine if in the same movie Glenn Close had to hand wrestle with an alien trying to bite her face off. Thats exactly as incongruous as the introduction of the alien element seems here. It would seem that no movie could possibly recover from such a turn into absurdity and maybe ""Dreamcatcher"" never does but neither does it ever quite release its grip on the audience. Either through its sheer relentlessness or the perverse appeal of its schizophrenic voice the movie holds on -- and this despite derivative-looking aliens which look like penises with teeth. Monsters looking like that were already wagging their way down corridors as early as the ""Hellraiser"" movies. Morgan Freeman turns up playing a typical King character an insane colonel/alien killer who wants to slaughter every human being thats come into contact with the aliens. But as directed by Kasdan Freeman doesnt seem crazy and until another character alludes to him as a lunatic he strikes us as a reasonable thoughtful character with an unusually grim way of expressing himself ""Come with me Ill show you things youll wish you never saw."" Kasdan works well with the actors. He usually does. Jane lends a sturdy presence and Lewis has fun in the showiest role his body simultaneously inhabited by an alien and a human. Talk about metaphors. That characters predicament is a little like the movies. ""Dreamcatcher"" could hardly be called a success -- its rather a likable disaster. But Kasdan can at least take pride in that having taken his humanism into the same movie with King he fought the horror master to a draw. . This film contains extreme violence blood and strong language.

The story is incoherent inane and interminable. Even its title is a puzzle because the plot has virtually nothing to do with dreams or the Native American symbol. Thomas Jane and Donnie Wahlberg star in supernatural thriller Dreamcatcher adapted from the Stephen King book. Though the tale adapted from Stephen Kings best-selling novel starts out with an eerie sense of foreboding Dreamcatcher fails to deliver thrills and chills. But it could easily make one ill with its numerous scenes of blood guts and dismemberment. The movie traces the lives of four small-town boys who rescued a retarded boy known as Duddits from the clutches of cruel bullies. For their courage Duddits somehow conferred upon his protectors the gift of mind reading. Review of the movie Dreamcatcher ( out of four) Stars Morgan Freeman Thomas Jane Jason Lee Damian Lewis Director Lawrence Kasdan Distributor Castle Rock Entertainment (Warner Bros. Pictures) Rating R for violence gore and language Opens Friday nationwide Twenty years later during the quartets annual visit to a cabin in the remote woods of Maine all manner of mayhem ensues. As a blizzard rages the men are confronted with an alien force that takes the form of a multi-fanged eel. For reasons that are unclear it transforms itself by taking over the body of one of the men (Damian Lewis) assuming the inexplicable (and hardly terrifying) moniker of Mr. Gray and feigning a British accent. Its hard to say which is more painful watching a man be gobbled up by the evil eel or suffering through Mr. Grays silly posturing and maniacal grin. And if all thats not laughable enough poor Morgan Freeman as a military official delivers some of the movies worst lines. Of refugees believed to have been exposed to aliens he says ""They drive Chevrolets and shop at Wal-Marts and never miss an episode of Friends. These are Americans. And it kills me to have to slaughter Americans."" Its hard to believe esteemed screenwriter William Goldman who adapted Kings Misery to the screen and also wrote Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid All the Presidents Men and The Princess Bride had a hand in this. Dreamcatcher was directed by Lawrence Kasdan whose The Big Chill Body Heat and The Accidental Tourist were seminal movies of the 80s. Is this how an auteur director who cant get his personal projects made must prove his bankability? Studio execs should rethink their policy of always adapting the books of successful authors and instead consider taking a chance on original material.

Upon achieving full tumescence it rears up and lunges for the crucial anatomical parts of the films four young male-bonded heroes. This is impolite but one cant help but see the alien members point of view  its targets are unspeakable dweebs cursed with a surfeit of humanitarian urges. Theyre meant to be creature fodder but the director Lawrence Kasdan has other plans. He wants them to be characters with backstories dreams values and other such nonsense. Twenty years earlier as country boys with not a care in the world save their bad 70s haircuts the foursome saved an ethereal lad named Dudditz from bullying quarterbacks and then on Dudditzs tip rescued a little girl marooned down a well. In return for these good deeds the lovable Dudditz an idiot savant with a nasty habit of murdering his consonants conferred on each of the boys his own special powers and threw in some dark hints about trouble yet to come which they naturally ignored in the interests of a viable horror picture. We meet them in the present still bonded but miserable in large measure because their unique gifts are not being put to proper use. Henry a psychiatrist improbably played by Thomas Jane who looks freshly risen from surf can read peoples thoughts and therefore knows when he is being lied to  a dubious power in his line of work. Beaver (Jason Lee) is a happy-go-lucky carpenter plagued by vague premonitions of lurking evil. Pete (Timothy Olyphant) the groups designated loser is a used-car salesman with an uncanny ability to find lost items a talent he squanders on trying to score with blonds. And Jonesy (Damian Lewis) is a good-hearted professor with an unusual memory who early on in the movie suffers a terrible accident significantly like the one that not long ago befell Stephen King on whose novel Dreamcatcher is based. I leave it to you to guess which of these superbly calibrated personalities is expendable and which will live to fight the good fight for the body and soul of America attractively summarized by one antagonist in the movie as ""people who drive Chevrolets shop at Wal-Mart and never miss an episode of Friends."" Pressing on the toothy organ henceforth affectionately known as the ""shitweasel"" slithers on through rural Maine leaving a blood-red trail in the snowdrifts (John Seales photography is gorgeous) until it discovers our four heroes holed up in a mangy log cabin for their annual homage-to-Dudditz retreat. A horror movie with sweetly liberal impulses isnt the snuggest fit especially one thats based on a novel by Stephen King a fine crafter of pop metaphors for invasion contagion mind control chaos and any other terrors we may currently be nursing. One dimly sees the ghost of a timely allegory in Dreamcatcher; not since the Cold War has the time been so right for equating the invasion of the body with the invasion of the nation. However the concept is undercut by the fact that the invader now cozily inhabiting the body of one of our fabulous four sounds  quelle horreur  exactly like Tony Blair. This is less than surprising when you consider that the director is Kasdan whos known for favoring broad schoolboy humor. Somewhere between Kings novel the screenplay by William Goldman (who also wrote a far better adaptation of Kings Misery) and Kasdans shooting script both character and metaphor have gone to the dogs leaving a slew of fart and burp jokes and laying bare Dreamcatchers driving purpose which is to make multiplexes full of little boys yuk it up then gross them out creep them out and finally feed them dessert with a crescendo of snowmobile chases ground-to-air gunfights and a climax that terrifies and finally flatters them into submission. What Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore as a crazed alien-fighter and his heir apparent are doing in this movie  unless it be to serve up the twisted father-son vibe essential to the demographic  is anybodys guess. And what Lawrence Kasdan is doing in charge is more mysterious yet. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm In the production notes for Dreamcatcher King gamely coughs up the politic view that Kasdan is uniquely qualified to make a horror movie because of his famous cutaway shot to Kevin Costners stitched wrist in the opening scene of The Big Chill. This would be a slim rsum in almost any business environment but Hollywood where notwithstanding its reputation for killing careers overnight many a player without a serious hit or a decent movie in his recent or distant past keeps right on getting the green light. There are a bunch of reasons for this. Some people marry the boss (William Friedkin) or build such cults around themselves (Clint Eastwood Jack Nicholson) that neither studios nor audiences care any longer whether their movies are any good. Kasdan has survived by being a good boy meaning an earnest limousine liberal with a gift for the broad comedy that passes for satire in big-budget movies. Reneging on the early promise he showed in Body Heat (1981) he made The Big Chill a crassly entertaining and highly successful vaudeville act which unaccountably cemented his reputation as a master of subtle characterization. His script work on The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi got him friends in high places and Kasdan spent the next two decades as a writer and director making movies that range from the pleasant (The Accidental Tourist Grand Canyon Mumford) to the dreadful (French Kiss and The Bodyguard a stinker written by Kasdan that made pots of money). In the unlikely event that Dreamcatcher bombs  the movie is too calculated too marketable and it bears the Stephen King coat of arms  Ive no doubt Kasdan will chug right along with the moneybags blessing. And then theres Roman Polanski who has not been a good boy or a pleasant one but whose picture The Pianist has gotten him seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture and thus has also gotten many Hollywood knickers in a royal twist about whether the Academy should reward a man accused of the statutory rape in 1977 of an adolescent girl. The girl herself Samantha Geimer now an apparently serene suburban mom in her late 30s has decreed on more than one talk show that the movie should be considered on its merits. In his Los Angeles Times column a couple of weeks ago Patrick Goldstein agreed with her. ""Artists are often unhappy dissolute disreputable people"" Goldstein wrote citing Charlie Chaplins predilection for very young women. ""The truth is that we always forgive them their transgressions because in the end the inspiration we find in their art outweighs our disapproval of their brutish behavior."" Well theres brutish and theres brutish. Chaplin married his young women; and none of them was 13 years old which is too young for consensual anything let alone sex. There are some degrees of evil I wouldnt forgive under any circumstances No matter how many tour de force shots there are in Triumph of the Will the only prize Id ever give Leni Riefenstahl is Liar of the Century. As it happens I wouldnt deny Polanski his Academy Award on moral grounds  hes suffered enough and been forgiven though an apology would have been nice. Im just not sure that The Pianist deserves the award on artistic grounds. It is a moving noble film made straight from the heart and it compares favorably with most of this years other nominees. Aesthetically speaking it is an entirely straightforward movie that doesnt begin to measure up to the formal sophistication of Polanskis best work in Repulsion Rosemarys Baby and Chinatown. Which leads me to suspect that should the movie win it would be because in our American way wed be giving Polanski an award not for his art but for being a more decent human being than we thought he was.

Posted March 19 2003 -- 1200 AM EST Of all the convoluted story lines competing clumsily for attention in Dreamcatcher the one about the alien worm that emerges from the anus of its human carrier in a sploosh of funny-gory goo is the one I brought home to impress the family. It was also one of the few plots I could follow in Lawrence Kasdans unintelligible adaptation of the 2001 Stephen King novel about...well so many anxiety-inducing states of being so few of them comprehensible to those who havent read the book. And for what it cost to create that worms fearsome special-effects choppers they should be. Theres a flashback ""Stand by Me"" subplot involving four best friends who save another boy (nicknamed ""Duddits"") from bullies. In gratitude the rescued Duddits - brain-damaged to look at him supernaturally gifted to know him - gives his new friends extrasensory gifts of their own. (His presence is felt in a woven and beaded basketlike ""dreamcatcher"" meant to protect the sleeping - a title object all but ignored in the inelegant screenplay by Kasdan and William Goldman.) Theres the ""Alien"" thing - the production notes forthrightly call the extraterrestrial menace a ""s-- weasel"" - thats infecting all of Maine. Theres a ""Men in Black""-ish military-gone-mad subplot in which Colonel Curtis (Morgan Freeman) an old hand at alien busting now Queegishly bonkers after years of fighting foreign scum pitilessly plans to wipe out the whole human neighborhood in a final government-sponsored attempt at eradication. Theres the present-day reunion of the men who were once boys (played as if in a separate indie film by Thomas Jane Jason Lee Timothy Olyphant and Damian Lewis). And theres a heroic last effort by a frail dying Duddits (Donnie Wahlberg) to stop those damn opportunistic tush parasites from ruining human toilet time once and for all. ""Dreamcatcher"" is one of Kings big fat geek settings crammed - like the ""Memory Warehouse"" of catalogued experiences retained in the brain of one of the grown friends - with bits fancies and the authors copious pop-culture free associations. (Average Americans says Curtis ""drive Chevrolets shop at Wal-Mart and never miss an episode of Friends."") The four friends in this horror-com (an environment starkly devoid of women) share a jaunty insiders language (""SSDD"" they say as in ""same s-- different day""). And Freeman the crazy-cowboy colonel cant speak a sentence to his second-in-command (Tom Sizemore) without turning it into a verbal riff. What fills some 600 King-size pages though is too much and too messy here Kasdan can create scenes of banter and menace of everyday Maine community and gut-gushing F/X but he cant wrestle this production into a coherent movie experience. And what gets mangled most grievously is the astute insight into the pop-saturated psyches of American boys and men that for all his romps with horror is Stephen Kings real writerly talent. The nightmare is that the live guys in this ""Dreamcatcher"" lose the battle the minute the mechanical worm turns.

Having shown greater interest in soul-searching than bodysnatching director Lawrence Kasdan seems an odd choice to tackle Stephen Kings return to supernatural horror ""Dreamcatcher."" As full of holes as the web-like Native American talisman that provides its title this overlong and unwieldy grab-bag of vintage monster-movie elements starts intriguingly as a snowbound deep-woods chiller but gradually dissolves into a mess of other-worldly invasion and military counter-offensive. Skimping on the humor that made other revisitations of Z-grade 50s drive-in fodder like ""Tremors"" or ""Arachnophobia"" work the Warner release looks to scare up modest theatrical numbers before finding its natural niche on video/DVD. Despite his early experience as co-scripter on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and the last two installments of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy Kasdan whose regular domain stresses emotional and interpersonal issues here shows no connection to a story driven by the fantastic. And while the scope exists for the kind of supernatural thriller with fully developed characters and relationships that this pairing of director and story would suggest its precisely those elements that are most conspicuously absent from the script co-written by Kasdan with William Goldman. Third encounter between the veteran screenwriter and bestselling frightmeister King is closer to the formers work on the unmemorable ""Hearts in Atlantis"" than on ""Misery"" one of the best of Kings screen transfers. ""Dreamcatcher"" hitches sci-fi horror about an alien menace to the story of four friends telepathically linked by a childhood incident -- basically this feels like an autopilot retread in which ""The Stand"" and ""The Tommyknockers"" meet ""Stand By Me."" As children in small-town Maine four friends -- now a shrink car salesman college professor and carpenter -- saved a handicapped kid named Duddits from bullies and were somehow imbued with powers of thought transference mind-reading and precognition. In a choppily structured prelude to the main action one of the guys Jonesy (Damian Lewis) suffers a near-death experience when hes hit by a car after being summoned by a vision of Duddits to walk into heavy traffic. Six months later the quartet reassembles for a weekend in the woods with Jonesy showing no sign of injury. A lost hunter stumbles into their cabin delirious with hypothermia scarred by a deep red stain that quickly spreads across his face and stricken with uncontrollable belching and flatulence. The helpless strangers upset stomach soon turns into the mother of all irritable bowel syndromes as he births a massive alien razor-toothed worm that promptly and monstrously kills Beaver (Jason Lee). Out in the woods a second angry serpentine intruder rips up buddy Pete (Timothy Olyphant) while back in the cabin another alien inhabits the body of Jonesy causing him for no particular reason to speak with a British accent. This leaves Henry (Thomas Jane) as the only uncontaminated group member. Having defied death once Jonesys true self also survives retreating into labyrinthine memory archive for help in combating the evil force. While Goldman and Kasdan effectively create a mood of impending dread the attempt to play mostly with a straight face the appearance of the ""shit-weasels"" -- as the guys so eloquently dub the anally birthed aliens -- sends the film careening into ridiculousness. Only Lee and Olyphant come close to hitting the right note of tongue-in-cheek humor that might have made all this palatable. Unfortunately theyre the first to go. Further problems stem from the miscasting of Morgan Freeman in a thankless role as a bullish army colonel determined to wipe out the alien marauders and not afraid to take human casualties. The film bears signs throughout of extensive recutting but nowhere is this more apparent than in the chaotically orchestrated climactic action involving the insane colonel his more ethical second-in-command (Tom Sizemore) chopper blitzes of the alien mother ship Jonesys maniacal quest to slip a worm into the water supply and Henrys recruitment of leukemia-afflicted Duddits (Donnie Wahlberg) whose mental powers are harnessed to second-guess and intimidate the monster inside Jonesy. A skilled genre manipulator like John Carpenter made this kind of material scary in ""The Thing"" limiting visual access to his alien. But Kasdan bares all in an approach too earnest for such high hokum. Effects work is polished -- though like the films tone and the storys jumble of poorly unified elements the monsters assume far too many different shapes and forms making them a somewhat amorphous threat. James Newton Howards creepy chiller score establishes a teasing ominous mood while John Seales nervously prowling widescreen lensing and magnificent aerial shots of the woods at times recall ""The Shining."" Perhaps in an attempt to squeeze some additional box office mileage from a rickety vehicle Warner is hitching the worldwide ""Dreamcatcher"" release to 11-minute short feature ""The Final Flight of the Osiris"" a breathless computer-animated primer for summer tentpole ""The Matrix Reloaded"" written and produced by the Wachowski brothers and directed by Andy Jones.
