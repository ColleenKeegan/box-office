Comments click to enlarge Devils Due Video Rated R  90 minutes  2014 Newlyweds from the U.S. are drugged and abducted while honeymooning in Santo Domingo; upon returning home the wife (Allison Miller) discovers shes expecting and the husband (Zach Gilford) plans to capture the pregnancy on video but a string of disturbing events reveals their baby to be Satans spawn. The movies found-footage conceit never creates a proper atmosphere something essential to any horror film but particularly one involving the occult. The similarities to Rosemarys Baby are obvious but the Polanski film is a study in isolation and paranoia; this is a simple genre exercise about how much it sucks to be pregnant.

"Devils Due 3.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Devils Due 3.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Fri Jan 17 2014 358 PM In ""Devils Due"" things start to go haywire for an expectant young couple as the wifes delivery date nears. The family pooch is suddenly jittery while the mom-to-be has violent mood swings and a voracious new appetite for raw meat. If it sounds familiar youve probably seen your fair share of horror movies made since 1968s ""Rosemarys Baby"" the grandaddy when it comes to flicks about hellish spawn. But lets give this ""Devil"" its due Although it wont win any points for originality it is a fast-moving little chiller filled with creepy atmosphere and convincing performances. The troubles begin for newlyweds Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha (Allison Miller) on their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. An overly friendly cab driver takes them to an underground party in a seedy part of town. They drink too much party and pass out. When they awake in their hotel room they have no memories of how they got there. Now is probably a good time to mention that the movie is shot in the found-footage style made popular by ""Paranormal Activity"" and its ilk. Zach constantly has a camera filming everything around him. Of course he doesnt bother to look at the footage until the movies final act which really would have helped clear up what exactly happened on that drunken honeymoon night. Gaping plot hole there but not a deal-breaker. Once the couple is back home Samantha quickly learns she is pregnant even though she was taking birth-control medication. Soon all the aforementioned strange happenings start occurring. Throw in an abandoned house in the neighborhood that is suddenly occupied a vanishing obstetrician and a first communion ceremony that goes terribly wrong and the chill factor quickly rises. Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett who both worked on the shocker ""V/H/S"" do wonders with mood and atmosphere. There seems to be a genuine sense of dread enveloping the couple as the film progresses toward its inevitable climax. Strong work from the two lead actors also adds heft to the proceedings. Gilford (TVs ""Friday Night Lights"") in particular is good as a young spouse who goes from goofy to confused to terrified. The movie is seen through his eyes and his anxious performance anchors the film. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849. Twitter.com/randy_cordova.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A newlywed couples pregnancy is unexpected and it turns out unwelcome. Rated R for violence language BOTTOM LINE ""Rosemarys Baby"" plus ""Paranormal Activity"" equals yet another found-footage horror flick. Its even less entertaining than it sounds. CAST Zach Gilford Allison Miller LENGTH 129 If youre a horror fan you might know the name of William Castle a producer-huckster whose promotional stunts were often better than his movies. Hes the guy who rigged skeletons to jump out of screens jolted audiences with seat buzzers and parked hearses outside theaters. In a trailer for 1961s ""Homicidal"" Castle personally threatened to kill anyone who revealed the movies ending. Castle died in 1977 having produced one towering horror classic 1968s ""Rosemarys Baby."" That one didnt need gimmicks. A shivery chiller about a young wife (Mia Farrow) who is drugged and impregnated by Satan ""Rosemarys Baby"" was the rare horror flick to walk the Oscars carpet earning a nomination for writer-director Roman Polanski and a win for supporting actress Ruth Gordon. Its been so widely imitated -- ""Demon Seed"" ""Its Alive"" ""The Omen"" -- that its now a genre unto itself. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? More than 45 years later ""Devils Due"" attempts to update the same story. Allison Miller and Zach Gilford (NBCs ""Friday Night Lights"") play Samantha and Zach McCall whose honeymoon in the Dominican Republic ends with a bleary night of partying and it transpires a pregnancy. As in ""Rosemarys Baby"" the new mother suffers wracking abdominal pains and craves blood-red meat; her OB-GYN seems a little fishy. Occult symbols keep popping up and woe betide any expert who tries to explain them. So far so identical. Wheres the ""update"" part? That would be Zachs maddening habit of toting around a video camera making ""Devils Due"" the umpteenth horror film to go for the found-footage gimmick. Zach repeatedly explains his videotaping -- ""Its for the baby"" -- but the filmmakers (directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett plus screenwriter Lindsay Devlin) still cant manage to maintain the conceit. Eventually they give up and resort to parking-lot cams security cams totally random cams. The result is a disjointed and unconvincing movie that is also embarrassingly derivative of ""Paranormal Activity."" The one thing about ""Devils Due"" that feels truly inspired isnt in the movie. Its a promotional video viewable on YouTube in which New York pedestrians who peek into a passing baby carriage are greeted by a ghastly spring-loaded infant mannequin. William Castle would have approved. MoviesOscar nominees 2014 _____ advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT A newlywed couples pregnancy is unexpected and it turns out unwelcome.

Michele Short By Peter Keough Globe Correspondent January 18 2014 700 PM Share Comment This is a summary. To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Share Comment At least theres a credible premise in ""Devils Due"" an otherwise feeble exercise in the found-footage form. All newlyweds these days seem to record everything in their lives - especially when the first born is due. Hence there is a plausible explanation for some of the material cobbled together by the directors ""V/H/S"" alumni Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. And the film also draws on a resonant horror theme. Beautiful though it might be doesnt the process of pregnancy and birth evoke primitive terror? Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett have obviously seen films such as ""The Omen"" (1976) ""Its Alive"" (1974) ""The Brood"" (1979) and ""Rosemarys Baby"" (1968). Evidently though their young camera-happy couple Samantha (Allison Miller) and Zach (Zach Gilford) have not. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

Unfortunately thats not a compliment. Although the film justifies its characters constant documentation about as effectively as any of these plausibility-stretchers ever will the feature-length debut of two thirds of the directorial troupe Radio Silence scrambles to find any excuse to cut to a new angle or shoot traditional coverage while debasing a potentially compelling story with every found-footage cliche in the book. Zach Gilford (""Friday Night Lights"") plays Zach a newlywed who decides to document every minute of life with his wife Samantha (Allison Miller) starting with their wedding. After a drunken night of partying with locals on their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic Zach and Samantha return home to the normalcy of their regular lives. But after Samantha discovers shes pregnant they eagerly prepare for the challenges of parenthood. Also read Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Review Chris Pine Reboots Tom Clancys Hero in a Slight But Spry Spy Game Before long Samantha starts to worry theres something wrong with the baby after she experiences odd pains - and displays unusual behavior. When they notice strangers watching their home and a local priest (Sam Anderson) has a bizarre encounter with Samantha Zach begins to realize something is really wrong - and even if he figures out what that is it may already be too late. Generally speaking I have no problem suspending disbelief in order to enjoy found-footage horror - of course theres no good reason for them to film all of the time. But ""Devils Due"" distinguishes itself much to its detriment by making a huge show of the characters reasoning and then packaging their entirely self-sustaining ""home movies"" in between recordings of a police interrogation of one of the survivors. And the fact that the police dont seem to believe the suspect despite what is very obviously a mountain of footage evidencing their innocence suggests that they didnt find or see the material were watching. So how exactly can you have a found footage movie if no one finds it? Also read G.B.F. Review Gay Teens Become Hot Accessories in This Sweet-Natured Comedy Meanwhile the filmmakers either had no confidence or no patience for the limitations of found-footage movies - which typically involve one camera or two maybe if say someone were to give the protagonist a GoPro as a wedding gift. Halfway through the film no fewer than 15 cameras are installed in Zach and Samanthas house effectively eliminating the need altogether for the technical conceit particularly since the remainder of the film regularly cuts from a variety of angles (and even external cameras) to document whats happening. Worse yet even with an omniscient viewpoint looming over everything the film still cant muster any suspense unless waiting for the inevitability of a one-second jump scare counts. There isnt a single set piece or scare in the film that hasnt been done before multiple times and better in one of the ""Paranormal"" films or their knockoffs. Suffice it to say casting one of the stars of ""Friday Night Lights"" in a main role and hiring hugely recognizable character actor Sam Anderson (""Lost"" ""WKRP"") further undermines any sense that this is real much less believable. But ultimately ""Devils Due"" is so preposterous and numbskulled that their actorly theatricality - by which I mean commitment to making stupid decisions -- is all thats left to hold onto. Because by the time the film comes back around to that bookend interrogation footage the only thing you can think about is what else youve seen them in before - especially since its where you will undoubtedly prefer to be.

The best that can be said for ""Devils Due"" is that unlike so many cheapo off-season horror projects its makers at least seem to respect the conventions and history of the genre. Taking so many notes from ""Rosemarys Baby"" that it may as well count as a remake the film expends plenty of effort crafting a few memorable freakout setpieces and nailing down the logistics of its found-footage camera placement yet it offers precious little in the way of real scares or engaging characters and even less in original ideas. The result could take advantage of the winter B.O. doldrums for a decent opening weekend though long-term prospects are murky. Featuring two protagonists who arent characters so much as collections of blandly likable little tics ""Devils Due"" centers on newlyweds Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha (Allison Miller) as they set off for a honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Zach is an inveterate videographer -- as he explains at some length in a sort of meta-expository monologue early on -- and with a lapel-mounted ""adventure cam"" he and Samantha venture into the Santo Domingo night. After a portentously disastrous visit to a palm reader the newlyweds end up lost in unfamiliar streets only to be rescued by a pushy cab driver (Roger Payano) who ferries them to an underground club on the outskirts of town where they proceed to get blackout drunk. Waking up with no memory of the nights conclusion the couple return home and Samantha soon discovers she is pregnant. It takes little time for her pregnancy to start heading in directions never imagined by Heidi Murkoff at which point directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett start to resemble a sort of Roman Polanski cover band running through all the greatest hits the raw meat consumption the peculiar pagan gifts the traffic mishaps the ocular abnormalities and the creepy new obstetrician just to name a few. The pic does make one significant deviation from Polanskis formula by switching the perspective from that of the expectant mother to the father with Zach the one who finally begins to investigate the strange goings-on. In more enterprising hands this could have potentially been a clever subversion of the sort of ""chicks amirite?"" attitudes common on male-driven network sitcoms imbuing all the most cliched female mood swings with truly sinister attributes. As it is the shift in p.o.v. merely robs the pic of the deep paranoia that made ""Rosemary"" so effective. It also means that Samantha effectively disappears as a fully human character a little over midway through largely depriving the film of its most charismatic actor. (Gilford is watchable enough but his character is so thinly drawn that we never even learn his profession.) The plot holes are numerous but none are more irritating than Zachs failure to actually watch any of these voluminous homemovies he seems to be shooting at all hours until its too late. And while the directors turn up the intensity for an effectively creepy (if overblown and somewhat premature) finale they fail to build any mounting dread in the lead-up to these fireworks turning the film into a pastiche of some interesting individual ideas that never cohere into anything truly unsettling. On a technical level ""Devils Due"" looks and sounds much better than most found-footage chillers which while welcome aesthetically does rob the pic of a certain verite grittiness. The filmmakers do well however to gradually widen the sources of their footage starting off confined to a first-person handheld perspective and picking up closed-circuit feeds and other new views as the plot allows. Louisiana and Dominican locations are well scouted though the source music choices are occasionally quite bizarre and the use of a Brenton Wood tune over the end credits may provoke more confusion and skeptical glances than the twist ending that precedes it.

Lombard Corporation says May 4 2015 at 433 am Derivative and no more entertaining than sneezing Devils Due at least offers some humor in its Third Act when the central character in the midst of a crisis stops to strap on his personal albeit cumbersome video camera without which he surely would not be able to compete with the likes of Paranormal Activity. Reply Carlo loury says November 23 2014 at 902 pm I loved it Reply jfoggy larry says January 25 2014 at 930 am I.woul d all so like too. C more horror Reply RIPOFF says January 18 2014 at 1008 pm Wow so darn disappointing again. Tricking us into thinking it might of actually been a good movie. Have to say it is so cheaply done and blatantly distasteful horror that really they should be ashamed. Clearly one of the worst films weve ever seen... Reply neff says January 18 2014 at 636 am I cant believe I waisted 10 to see the worst horror movie ever. It literally ruined all future horror films for me. Reply Glenn C. says January 17 2014 at 314 pm Its easier to just copy from another. There are so many great new ideas out there and studios seem to usually pick the same old thing to make They all are afraid Like what we should be seeing one of their films like this one but arent Reply LOL says January 17 2014 at 1049 am Another week another crap American horror film.
